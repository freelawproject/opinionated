Engelmayer, United States District Judge\n   Two months before she died in August 1962, Marilyn Monroe posed at the Bel-Air Hotel in Los Angeles for a series of photographs-known as the \"Last Sitting\"-taken by the famed photographer Bert Stern. Soon after Monroe's death, some of those photographs were published in\n   <em>\n    Vogue\n   </em>\n   magazine. They became iconic.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This case centers on claims that defendants Lisa and Lynette Lavender (\"the Lavenders\") infringed copyright with respect to various Last Sitting photographs. Stern's widow, Shannah Laumeister Stern (as trustee of Stern's testamentary trust), and Stern's production company, Bert Stern Productions LLC (\"BSP\", and collectively, \"plaintiffs\"), bring claims against the Lavenders, former longtime assistants to Stern. They claim that the Lavenders, without a license to do so, took a number of actions constituting copyright infringement. These mostly involved the reproduction, offer, and sale (on sites including eBay and Amazon) of modified versions of certain of these photographs,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The parties have now cross-moved for summary judgment, in whole or part. The motions implicate two broad questions. First, and most consequential, was Bert Stern-and today are the successors to his rights-the rightful owners of the copyright interests in these photographs? The Lavenders claim that Stern never had such rights. They claim that the photographs of Monroe taken by Stern were in fact \"works for hire\" whose copyright belongs to Cond\u00e9 Nast, publisher of\n   <em>\n    Vogue\n   </em>\n   , which helped arrange Stern's photo shoots with Monroe. Therefore, they claim, Stern's heirs cannot maintain this action. Second, assuming that Stern was the rightful copyright owner, did Stern gift certain photographs to the Lavenders, and did he authorize the Lavenders to make, modify, and sell, following his death, copies of the Monroe photographs? The Lavenders claim that Stern did so shortly before he died. Plaintiffs dispute this.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In the decision that follows, the Court resolves the first of these two broad issues, relating to ownership of copyright in the Last Sitting photographs. For the reasons set forth below, the Court finds that Stern was-and that his successors in interest are-the rightful owner(s) of the copyright to the photographs. As to this issue, the Lavenders have not adduced evidence sufficient to create a genuine dispute of material fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   As to the claims that the Lavenders have infringed plaintiffs' copyright through various actions since Stern's death, however, material disputes of fact preclude summary judgment on most of these claims, as well as plaintiffs' non-copyright claims brought under the Lanham Act and state law. The disputed fact issues centrally include whether Stern, before his death, gave gifts to the Lavenders of certain Last Sitting photographs, either in original or modified form, and/or whether he authorized them, after his death, to make and sell reproductions of those works, including in \"poster\" form. The disputed fact issues also include whether Stern authorized the Lavenders to, after his death, sign his name to certificates of authenticity issued along with photographs that they sold.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Court does, however, resolve two narrower issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   First, the Court holds, with the Lavenders, that-assuming\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   that the Lavenders were found to be the outright owners of certain photographs per gifts from Stern-it was fair use for the Lavenders, in the course of selling such work on Internet sites such as eBay, to display online an image of the object offered for sale. This holding does not, however, dispose of any claim brought, because the Lavenders' ownership of Stern's photographs is disputed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Second, the Court grants summary judgment to plaintiffs on the Lavenders' one surviving counterclaim, which alleged a violation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20512\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 512\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f), in connection with \"take-down\" notices that plaintiffs sent to eBay in an attempt to block sales of original and modified Stern prints.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The case will proceed now to trial, within the parameters set by these rulings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Stern and \"The Last Sitting\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In June 1962, Bert Stern, a celebrated commercial and fine-art photographer known for his photographs of celebrities of his era, including Sophia Loren, Audrey Hepburn, and Elizabeth Taylor, JSF \u00b6 1, photographed Marilyn Monroe at the Bel-Air Hotel in Los Angeles.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20512\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20512\">\n    \u00b6 2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Taken over three sittings, Stern's 2,571 photographs of Monroe are known collectively as the Last Sitting. JSF \u00b6\u00b6 11, 15. Stern later wrote at length about the sittings themselves and the events leading up to them, including his memorable interactions with Monroe, in\n   <em>\n    The Last Sitting\n   </em>\n   , a 188-page book published in 1982 and excerpted at length in a contemporaneous\n   <em>\n    Vogue\n   </em>\n   magazine article.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   JSF \u00b6\u00b6 12, 14;\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20512\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Ex. 3 (\"1982\n   <em>\n    Vogue\n   </em>\n   Article\"). Later in this decision, the Court recaps Stern's account of the events leading to the sittings, because that account is central to the Lavenders' claim here that Stern's photographs were works for hire whose copyright belongs to Cond\u00e9 Nast, which had arranged aspects of the sittings with the intent of publishing some of Stern's photographs in\n   <em>\n    Vogue\n   </em>\n   , of which it was publisher.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On August 5, 1962, shortly after the photographs were taken, Monroe died.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On September 1, 1962,\n   <em>\n    Vogue\n   </em>\n   published six of the photographs.

Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The parties have cross-moved on the issue, relevant to all claims of infringement, whether Stern held-and thus whether plaintiffs, as his successors in interest, hold-the copyright to the Last Sitting works. The summary judgment motions also implicate two other discrete questions relating to plaintiffs' claims of infringement with respect to the Lavenders' display or sale of Last Sitting prints, both in original and modified (jeweled) form. Finally, plaintiffs move for summary judgment on the Lavenders' counterclaim challenging plaintiffs' takedown notices to eBay, and the Lavenders move for summary judgment on plaintiffs' state-law claim for return of property. The Court takes up these questions in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Ownership of Copyright for the Last Sitting Photographs\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The parties dispute whether Stern\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   owned the copyright interests in the Last Sitting photographs. As reviewed above, in 1982, Stern registered more than 100 of these photographs for copyright, and in 2013, his estate registered all 2,571 photographs. The Lavenders argue, however, that in fact Cond\u00e9 Nast-although it contractually acknowledged Stern's ownership, never pursued a claim to such ownership, and over the years repeatedly acquired licenses from Stern to publish works-was and is the owner of the copyrights to these works, on a \"work for hire\" theory.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   On this premise, the Lavenders argue that any claim that they have infringed copyright can be pursued by Cond\u00e9 Nast only. The Court first sets out the law governing this dispute over ownership and then applies this law.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-187\">\n    This Court draws its account of the facts of this case from the parties' submissions in support of and in opposition to the motions for summary judgment, including: the parties' joint statement of stipulated facts, Dkt. 67 (\"JSF\"); plaintiffs' Local Rule 56.1 statement, Dkt. 76 (\"Pl. 56.1\"); defendants' Local Rule 56.1 statement, Dkt. 82 (\"Def. 56.1\"); plaintiffs' counter-statement to defendants' Local Rule 56.1 statement, Dkt. 96 (\"Pl. 56. 1 Response\"); the declarations of Helene M.

Analysis\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    The Court's analysis begins with Stern's registrations of the copyright to the Last Sitting images. For the reasons explained below, the Court holds that these registrations both give rise to a rebuttable presumption that Stern owned the copyright in the Last Sitting photographs. With the burden shifted to the Lavenders to rebut the presumption of copyright ownership, the Court addresses the Lavenders' claim that Cond\u00e9 Nast, not Stern, is the rightful owner. Once inadmissible evidence is stripped away, this claim is based solely on Stern's account in\n    <em>\n     The Last Sitting\n    </em>\n    of how he came to photograph Monroe. The Court finds that this ancient and ultimately inconclusive narrative is insufficient to rebut the presumption of validity. Independently, the Court, which serves as the finder of fact in this case,\n    <footnotemark>\n     12\n    </footnotemark>\n    finds that even if Stern's 1982 narrative could be read to support a work-for-hire theory, such an inference\n    would be vastly outweighed by the strong circumstantial evidence that Stern owned the copyright to these works. These include legally operative agreements, and a long and consistent course of dealing, between Stern and Cond\u00e9 Nast. Thus, in its role as trier of fact, the Court would reach the same conclusion. Accordingly, the Court holds that there are no material disputes of fact on this point and that Stern is the copyright holder of all of the Last Sitting images.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    <strong>\n     a. The Copyright Registrations as Prima Facie Evidence of Ownership\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    As noted, Stern's estate is the registered copyright holder of all of the Last Sitting images.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Complete Last Sitting Copyright Registration. In 1982,\n    <em>\n     The Last Sitting\n    </em>\n    book-containing more than 100 of the Last Sitting photographs-was registered for copyright in the United States. JSF \u00b6 13;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    JSF Ex. 2. Stern was identified as the copyright claimant for all but the text of the book, including all of the photographs. JSF \u00b6 13;\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Def. 56.1 \u00b6 17. Later, in 2013, Stern's estate registered for copyright all 2,571 photographs taken by Stern during the Last Sitting as published in that book. JSF \u00b6 15; Complete Last Sitting Copyright Registration.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    The 1982 registration was virtually contemporaneous with the 1982 publication of\n    <em>\n     The Last Sitting\n    </em>\n    . As such, it came well within five years of the first publication of the photographs published in that book.\n    <footnotemark>\n     13\n    </footnotemark>\n    Under\n    <extracted-citation index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20410\">\n     17 U.S.C. \u00a7 410\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (c), a \"certificate of [copyright] registration made before or within five years after first publication of the work shall constitute prima facie evidence of the validity of the copyright.\" Where there has been such registration, \"the party challenging the validity of the copyright has the burden to prove the contrary.\"\n    <em>\n     Hamil Am.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11561553\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/193/92/#p98\">\n     193 F.3d at 98\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Thus, as to the works first published in 1982 and registered for copyright that same year, the Lavenders bear the burden of proving that the copyright registration was invalid.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     FameFlynet, Inc. v. Shoshanna Collection, LLC\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12522661\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/282/618/#p623\">\n     282 F.Supp.3d 618\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 623 (S.D.N.Y. 2017).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    The 2013 registration is of a different legal character. It came some 21 years after the 1992 publication of the Schirner-published\n    <em>\n     Marilyn Monroe\n    </em>\n    . The statutory presumption of ownership does not attach to this registration. Instead, \"[t]he evidentiary weight to be accorded\" to this registration is \"within the discretion of the court.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20410\">\n     17 U.S.C. \u00a7 410\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (c).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-91\">\n    Exercising that discretion, the Court's determination is that, on the facts here, the 2013 copyright registration ought to be afforded weight commensurate with that of the 1982 registration. The two registrations relate to a common set of 2,571 photographs that were taken contemporaneously (over three June 1962 sittings) under common circumstances. The Court has been given no basis in facts or evidence on which to treat differently the two tranches of registered works.\n    <footnotemark>\n     14\n    </footnotemark>\n    The different registration\n    dates instead appear to derive from the circumstance that only a subset of the 2,571 images were chosen for the 1982\n    <em>\n     Last Sitting\n    </em>\n    book, the need to register which appears to have driven the 1982 registration of the photos within it. There is no legal significance to that circumstance.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    Further, in the 31 years between 1982 and the 2013 registration of the remaining photographs from the Last Sitting, Stern's claim to ownership of copyright was unchallenged. Quite to the contrary, the entity, Cond\u00e9 Nast, whom the Lavenders posit was the rightful owner, repeatedly affirmed, in a contract and in its conduct obtaining licenses to the works from Stern,\n    <em>\n     Stern's\n    </em>\n    ownership. Insofar as the law treats the 1982 registration as shifting the burden of proof to a party contesting ownership of the photographs then registered, it is sensible to treat in like manner the remainder of the Last Sitting photographs.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-93\">\n    In its discretion under \u00a7 410(c), the Court therefore finds that a presumption of valid ownership on Stern's part applies to all the Last Sitting photographs, including those first registered in 2013.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Yurman Design, Inc. v.

The Lavenders' Proposed Rebuttal Evidence\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    The issue then is whether the Lavenders have come forward with sufficient evidence to rebut the presumption that Stern's registrations were valid. To this end, the Lavenders argue that the owner of the Last Sitting photographs was\n    <em>\n     Vogue\n    </em>\n    publisher Cond\u00e9 Nast, which \"employed\" Stern, making his photographs works for hire. In support, the Lavenders offer two sets of evidence: (1) Stern's 1982 account in\n    <em>\n     Vogue\n    </em>\n    (itself an excerpt from the 1982\n    <em>\n     Last Sitting\n    </em>\n    book) of how the photographs came about; and (2) correspondence decades later among lawyers for Stern, Cond\u00e9 Nast, and the Lavenders commenting on the issue of ownership.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    <strong>\n     i.

And on top of that, I got ten pages to do whatever I wanted with-and enough expense money to produce them.\"\n    <em>\n     The Last Sitting\n    </em>\n    at 17.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-100\">\n    As to the impetus for the Last Sitting project, Stern writes that he was traveling to Rome for a different project when he had an idea: \"A beautiful picture of Marilyn Monroe in\n    <em>\n     Vogue ... that\n    </em>\n    was an idea that had a glow to it.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3994120\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/689/221/#p227\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    (ellipsis and emphasis in original). When Stern landed in Rome, he called his assistant in New York and said, \"Vickie, call Marilyn Monroe's agent and see if she'll pose for me for\n    <em>\n     Vogue\n    </em>\n    .\" \"Oh what a\n    <em>\n     great\n    </em>\n    idea!\" his assistant replied. Stern said, \"And check it out with\n    <em>\n     Vogue\n    </em>\n    . Go over to their library and see if they've ever run a picture of her. Okay?\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 21. The next day, Stern's assistant Vickie called back. She said, \"Good news boss .... Yes, yes, and no. Marilyn Monroe says yes,\n    <em>\n     Vogue\n    </em>\n    says yes, and no, they've never done her before.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 22.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-101\">\n    Back in New York, Stern came up with where to shoot Monroe (the Bel-Air Hotel in Los Angeles) and how: \"purely Marilyn, nude.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 25. Stern also devised the means by which he would secure that desired shot: \"Maybe the only way I was going to get it was through illusion: screens, veils. So I went to\n    <em>\n     Vogue\n    </em>\n    and said, 'Can you get me some scarves? Scarves you can see through-with geometrics. And jewelry.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-102\">\n    Stern photographed Monroe in three sessions that June, all at the Bel-Air Hotel. For the first session, Stern designed the set, the lighting, and even the music. And he-and Monroe-dictated the course that that shoot took.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 26. \"Monroe ... posed for Stern in the nude or with nothing more than various sheer scarves, sheets, and costume jewelry.\" Def. 56.1 \u00b6 12;\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    1982\n    <em>\n     Vogue\n    </em>\n    Article at 7.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-103\">\n    Following this session, Stern returned to New York, where he developed the images and brought them to the editorial director of Cond\u00e9 Nast, Alex Liberman.\n    <em>\n     Last Sitting\n    </em>\n    at 73. Liberman instructed Stern that, while\n    <em>\n     Vogue\n    </em>\n    liked the photographs, it wanted to run a full eight-page spread, and wanted more black and white fashion photographs.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 74-75. With this,\n    <em>\n     Vogue\n    </em>\n    arranged additional sessions for Stern to photograph Monroe.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 79.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-104\">\n    For this second shoot,\n    <em>\n     Vogue\n    </em>\n    contacted Monroe.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    After she agreed, Stern arranged again for a suite at the Bel-Air-a three-room cottage, Number 96, on the Bel Air grounds.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 80.\n    <em>\n     Vogue\n    </em>\n    sent Stern to Los Angeles with a hairdresser, Kenneth, and an editor, Babs Simpson. As Stern recounted, \"The fact that\n    <em>\n     Vogue\n    </em>\n    was sending an editor on the shoot was a sign that they were getting serious. The first time they'd let me go off and do whatever I wanted, but now they had realized that I was on to something, and they were going to make sure they got what\n    <em>\n     they\n    </em>\n    wanted.

This second set of images has become known as the \"fashion\" images. Def. 56.1 \u00b6 12.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-105\">\n    As Stern recounts, these clothed poses were \"going in the opposite direction from my original idea.\"\n    <em>\n     Last Sitting\n    </em>\n    at 83. \"Vogue wanted to dress Marilyn up in beautiful clothes and I still thought the right thing to do was take her clothes off.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 86.

There was no one to tell us to shoot another dress or straighten another hair. This was just for us.\" Monroe asked Stern, \"What do you want to do?\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    Stern then photographed Monroe in bed, wrapped in a sheet.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 118-36.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-106\">\n    Two days later, Monroe returned to the Bel-Air Hotel for the third sitting.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 150. That day, Stern remembered that he had not yet taken an image he had set out to take: \"that one black and white that was going to last forever, like Steichen's Garbo.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    Stern then directed his assistant, Simpson, and Kenneth to make that shot possible.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 153. Stern took the photo from above. As he recounted, \"I saw what I wanted, I pressed the button, and she was mine.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 158.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-107\">\n    Stern returned to New York, where he supervised his studio assistant, Gar, in developing the images.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 173. \"Gar knew how to make prints the way I liked them, and I had built him the best darkroom setup money could buy.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    While working in the darkroom, Stern received a call from a\n    <em>\n     Vogue\n    </em>\n    representative, informing him that Monroe had final approval of all of the photographs.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    Stern then selected 30 of his favorite works, including \"one picture I really cared about\": the headshot.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 174. A few weeks later, Stern saw the images\n    <em>\n     Vogue\n    </em>\n    had selected for publication. \"[T]here was something haunting about the pictures they had chosen. All those black dresses, dark clothing, dark background ... the layouts had an elegiac quality. It was strange and eerie.

Assessment\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-109\">\n    All parties agree that Stern's narrative from\n    <em>\n     The Last Sitting\n    </em>\n    would be admissible at trial if offered by the Lavenders.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2) (party-opponent statement admissible for truth of matter asserted). That, however, is the entirety of the evidence that the Lavenders propose to offer as to the circumstances surrounding the Last Sitting. The Lavenders have not identified any surviving witnesses to these events; they have not identified or proposed to offer the memoirs of any other person who participated in arranging the sitting (if such accounts were even admissible); and they have not identified any contemporaneous records bearing on the dealings between Stern, Cond\u00e9 Nast, and Monroe in connection with these sittings.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-110\">\n    The Lavenders argue that Stern's narrative itself sufficiently establishes that the Last Sitting photographs were created at Cond\u00e9 Nast's \"instance and expense\" as to be works for hire under the 1909 Act. Stern's narrative, they argue, rebuts the presumption of copyright ownership arising from the registrations of those photographs. And because there is no other surviving evidence as to the circumstances of the sittings, the Lavenders argue, Stern's narrative establishes that the photographs were \"work for hire\" belonging to Cond\u00e9 Nast.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-111\">\n    The Court takes a different view. In the Court's assessment, Stern's 1982 remembrance of\n    <em>\n     The Last Sitting\n    </em>\n    cannot bear the legal weight that the Lavenders place on it.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-112\">\n    To be sure, one can extract aspects of Stern's narrative to support a work-for-hire theory. Such a theory would focus on Stern's account of the second and third sittings. These, Stern wrote, were arranged at\n    <em>\n     Vogue's\n    </em>\n    request and with\n    <em>\n     Vogue\n    </em>\n    picking up the tab for certain associated expenses. At the same time, numerous facts in Stern's narrative point towards the opposite result: that the Monroe photographs were not works for hire. As to the critical legal question of ownership, Stern's long-after remembrance is ultimately an equivocal and question-begging text. It is, in the end, far too elusive a source to determine the legal rights to an iconic photographic trove.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-113\">\n    The facts tending to make Stern the photographs' author include the following. As to the work-for-hire element of \"instance,\" Stern states that the idea to photograph Monroe was his.\n    <em>\n     Vogue's\n    </em>\n    role as to the first sitting with Monroe was decidedly secondary, with the magazine's interest emerging largely after the fact. And while\n    <em>\n     Vogue\n    </em>\n    was a greater impetus for the second and third sittings, having had the idea to shoot fashion images with Monroe clothed, it was Stern's idea, in the midst of those sittings, to shoot what proved the most iconic images from these sittings, including those of Monroe in a bedsheet and those depicting her from above. Further, Stern's essay repeatedly reveals that Stern retained creative control over the project. At times in collaboration with Monroe, he directed the lighting, the sets, and the poses for the bulk of the images.\n    <em>\n     Vogue\n    </em>\n    retained creative discretion as to a decision not bearing on copyright ownership: which among Stern's many photographs to publish in its pages.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-114\">\n    As to the element of \"expense,\" while\n    <em>\n     Vogue\n    </em>\n    covered various expenses for the Last Sitting, the terms of Stern's compensation are ambiguous. Stern's remembrance also leaves inconclusive who-as between Stern and\n    <em>\n     Vogue\n    </em>\n    -footed the bill for the cases of Dom Perignon and Chateau Lafite-Rothschild. Stern depicts these libations as bought purposely to liberate his and Monroe's creative impulses in connection with the photo shoot, and as having influenced, among other things, Monroe's choices as to how to pose. Stern's narrative also recounts that, at least with respect to the black and white images, it was in his darkroom that his assistant, Gar, developed those images.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-115\">\n    Critical, too, is an issue which Stern's narrative does not address: whether there was an understanding at the time of the sittings between him and\n    <em>\n     Vogue\n    </em>\n    as to who would retain ownership of the copyrights to the works. Under the 1909 Act, as under the 1976 Act, an agreement as to ownership between a photographer and the entity that hired him could be dispositive as to copyright ownership.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Urbont\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6055611\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/831/80/#p87\">\n     831 F.3d at 85-86\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (\"Under the 1909 Copyright Act, an \"employer\" who hires another to create a copyrightable work is the \"author\" of the work for purposes of the statute,\n    <em>\n     absent an agreement to the contrary.\n    </em>\n    \") (emphasis added) (internal quotation omitted);\n    <em>\n     Martha Graham Sch.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9212418\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/380/624/#p632\">\n     380 F.3d at 636\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (\"[U]nder both the 1909 and 1976 Acts, a person's status as an employee renders a work created within the scope of employment as a work for hire, as to which the copyright belongs to the employer (in the absence of a contract providing otherwise).\"). Stern's narrative in\n    <em>\n     The Last Sitting\n    </em>\n    refers generally to the existence of a \"contract\" between him and Vogue.\n    <em>\n     See Last Sitting\n    </em>\n    at 17 (\"\n    <em>\n     Vogue\n    </em>\n    had given me a contract to shoot one hundred fashion pages a year. And on top of that, I got ten pages to do whatever I wanted with-and enough expense money to produce them.\"). But it is silent as to the terms of that agreement.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-116\">\n    That is understandable: As\n    <em>\n     The Last Sitting\n    </em>\n    makes clear, Stern intended his 1982 book as an affectionate memoir of a brush with a cinematic legend. Stern recounts with emotion his frisson with the iconic, arresting, and-as ensuing events soon proved-doomed Monroe. In preparing this account, Stern surely did not envision his memoir as a text from which a determination as to copyright ownership might decades later be made. Unsurprisingly,\n    <em>\n     The Last Sitting\n    </em>\n    does not recite the terms of Stern's contract with Cond\u00e9 Nast. And discovery of Stern and Cond\u00e9 Nast has failed to locate that agreement.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-117\">\n    Under these circumstances, assigning dispositive significance to Stern's narrative would accent an historical accident: that, today, 56 years after the events at issue, Stern's account alone survives. All other direct evidence bearing on copyright ownership has been lost to history. The percipient witnesses are all likely dead. And no contemporaneous records of what these persons intended about copyright ownership, or how the sittings came about, survive. The doctrine that gives presumptive weight to copyright registrations exists for such situations. In cases of ancient and hard-to-reconstruct events, the fact of copyright registration within five years of first publication supplies a rational default standard.\n    <em>\n     See generally\n    </em>\n    3 Nimmer on Copyright \u00a7 12.11.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-118\">\n    It rightly so functions here. Stern's hagiographic memoir of his encounters with a 20\n    <sup>\n     th\n    </sup>\n    century icon is insufficient to rebut the presumption in his favor as to the Last Sitting. And, until the Lavenders posited otherwise after being sued in this case, Stern's claims of ownership had gone publicly unchallenged for 36 years. To disturb that long-unchallenged claim based on a deconstruction of his memoir would indulge in unacceptable speculation as to arrangements between persons long gone. It would assign undue importance to a remembrance written for quite different purposes.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-119\">\n    Deferring to the copyright registrations is particularly appropriate here. The course of dealing between Stern and Cond\u00e9 Nast as to these photographs since 1962 is squarely at odds with the Lavenders' thesis as to copyright ownership. These dealings reflect a common understanding that Stern owned the copyrights to these photographs. There were repeated grants of licenses to Cond\u00e9 Nast publications by Stern to publish photographs from the Last Sitting. And the 1982 agreement between Cond\u00e9 Nast and Stern explicitly identifies Stern as the copyright owner.\n    <em>\n     Cf.\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Ward v.

Such secondhand commentary is inadmissible on the issue of ownership.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-122\">\n    First, in 1998, after Stern's 1997 lawsuit was discontinued, Cond\u00e9 Nast's outside counsel wrote Stern's counsel.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    MacGiollabhui Decl. Ex. F. Cond\u00e9 Nast's counsel stated that Cond\u00e9 Nast did not possess the contract to which Stern had referred in his 1982 memoir.

Moving forward, as in the past, Cond\u00e9 Nast will not pay royalties to the Bert Stern Estate on revenues generated through the licensing and/or reproduction print sales of Cond\u00e9 Nast's copyrighted works. Additionally, any requests for licensing of the copyrighted material should be returned to Cond\u00e9 Nast.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-125\">\n    Boughn Decl.

Not only does it represent a legal conclusion by a\n    non-participant writer, it is also internally contradictory or, at best, opaque. On plaintiffs' reading, the email's second sentence states that the rights to the Last Sitting photographs at some point had been transferred to Stern. But the previous sentence suggests the opposite, stating that Cond\u00e9 Nast \"owns the copyright to works commissioned by Cond\u00e9 Nast magazines pursuant to contracts with Mr. Stern and the copyright law in effect at the time.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-127\">\n    Finally, in 2017, Cond\u00e9 Nast reported to the Lavenders's counsel that while it lacked records or witnesses as to the events at issue, its position, based on Stern's memoir, was that \"Cond\u00e9 Nast would be deemed to be the owners of the copyright therein.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    MacGiollabhui Decl., Exs.

As to the former, plaintiffs claim that the Lavenders made unauthorized copies of Last Sitting photographs, publicly displayed these copies,\n    and offered for sale and sold those copies. As to the latter, plaintiffs claim that the Lavenders modified Last Sitting photographs, publicly displayed these in modified form, and offered for sale and sold these modified images.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Am.

Here, as the\n    <em>\n     Rosen\n    </em>\n    court reasoned, the effect on the market of reproducing an image of the copyrighted work on eBay is \"minimal\" because \"the use of the images by eBay and its users are transformative and are not commercially exploitative, and they do not substitute for paying for legitimate copies.\"\n    <em>\n     Rosen\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%201600081\">\n     2015 WL 1600081\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *19. Put simply, a reasonable buyer of an original Stern photograph-or a Stern Modified Print-would not be satisfied with a thumbnail image as contained on an Internet webpage.

On February 7, 2017, plaintiffs' counsel, representing the Bert Stern Trust, submitted takedown notices of infringement to eBay, pursuant to the DMCA, Pub. L. 105-304, \u00a7 202, Oct. 28, 1998,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=112%20Stat.%202860\">\n     112 Stat. 2860\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (codified at\n    <extracted-citation index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20512\">\n     17 U.S.C. \u00a7 512\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (c) ).

Counsel's notices initially designated eBay's \"reason code 4.2\" as the basis for asserting infringement. That code connotes that the \"[l]isting contains [an] unlawful copy of [a] copyrighted image.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    JSF Exs. 12A &amp; 13.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-164\">\n    An email exchange with eBay followed. Explaining the reason-code designation, plaintiffs' counsel stated: \"The items are a limited edition print of a copyrighted photograph and are works of visual art. The uploading and public display of these items on eBay constitutes copyright infringement without regard to whether the item is counterfeit or not. No one can photograph these items as that too would constitute copyright infringement.\" JSF Ex. 13B. An eBay official responded that the reason code was incorrect, and that if counsel's \"concern [was] with the product being sold,\" the Trust needed to submit a revised notice with a reason code related to \"copyright-item infringement.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"168\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20512\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    Plaintiffs' counsel thereupon changed the designated reason code to code 6.1, a residual category for \"other\" types of infringement.

And critically here, the Lavenders have not supplied a factual basis on which to find the opposite: that plaintiffs, in pursuing takedown notices, made a knowing material misrepresentation. Plaintiffs' claim of copyright infringement in connection with the Lavenders' offer to sell Last Sitting photographs and Modified Prints was clearly colorable. It tracks the infringement claims that will proceed to trial in this lawsuit. And while the facts as to whether the late Stern had given away certain items and authorized certain posthumous actions are disputed, the Trust had sound reason to conclude that he had not done so and that the Lavenders do not own the objects they were offering for sale. If so, the Lavenders' display of photographs of those objects incident to the offer of them of sale would necessarily violate plaintiffs' copyright (as those displays would no longer be fair use because they would not be in service of lawful sales). For the Trust to assert this position did not evince bad faith or entail the making of a material misrepresentation. Further, as to the \"reason code\" that plaintiffs' counsel came to use, counsel's written exchange with eBay reflects that counsel accurately recited plaintiffs' theory of infringement to eBay, and then relied on eBay's instructions as to the code to use.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-168\">\n    The Court therefore enters summary judgment for plaintiffs on the Lavenders' counterclaim.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     UMG Recordings, Inc. v.

A finder of fact could also find that the document was not meant to have posthumous effect, but was only to cover the period when Stern was too ill to sign or sell prints himself. A finder might note, too, the testimony of Lynette Lavender that Lisa Lavender sometimes retroactively signed prints,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Lynette Lavender Dep. at 186-87, a practice that the June 16, 2013 writing does not explicitly countenance.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-175\">\n    The Court denies the Lavenders' motion for summary judgment on plaintiffs' Lanham Act claim.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-176\">\n    <strong>\n     E.

First, they argue, to the extent plaintiffs have cast their claim of improper retention of Stern's property as a breach of contract, they have not adduced a written contract resolving, as between Stern and the Lavenders, the posthumous possessory rights to these materials.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Def. Br. at 18. But plaintiffs did not allege the existence of a written agreement. Instead, they relied on the law of agency. They posited that, during Stern's lifetime, the Lavenders were his agents, and thus duty bound to safeguard his property and return it to his heirs or BSP absent authorization to keep it. Although the absence of a written agreement may bear on who had the right to retain the prints and electronic records that the Lavenders possess, it is ultimately a question of fact whether the Lavenders were entitled, on the basis of an asserted oral agreement with Stern or otherwise, to retain electronic copies of his prints and other items after Stern died. There is sufficient evidence, including circumstantial, on which plaintiffs can contend that the Lavenders never obtained any such posthumous rights at all, including to keep prints or electronic images thereof.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-179\">\n    Second, the Lavenders argue that this claim was brought outside the three-year statute of limitations for claims of conversion. Def. Br. at 17. The Court reserves judgment on this argument, which has been thinly briefed. The Court notes that Stern's will was not accepted for probate\n    until 2016,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    JSF \u00b6 5, that letters testamentary were not issued until March 3, 2016, for Laumeister Stern, Bert Stern's widow and the trustee of the Bert Stern 2010 Trust, to which Stern's assets passed under his will,\n    <em>\n     see\n     <extracted-citation index=\"182\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201125\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"182\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201125\">\n     \u00b6\u00b6 4-5\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , and that this lawsuit was initiated nine months later, on December 22, 2016,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Dkt. 1.

There is no claim, for example, that the photographs that appeared in the 1982 book, and thus were registered in 1982, were all taken at a single sitting.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"15\">\n    <p id=\"p-202\">\n     Although only the 1982\n     <em>\n      Vogue\n     </em>\n     Article was submitted as part of the summary judgment record, the Court has found it useful to draw upon the more complete account in the 1982 Morrow book,\n     <em>\n      The Last Sitting\n     </em>\n     , from which the 1982 Article was excerpted, which the Court requested be made part of the record,\n     <em>\n      see\n     </em>\n     Dkt. 105, and which is properly considered.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"16\">\n    <p id=\"p-203\">\n     As noted above, the parties have not located any written contract between Stern and Cond\u00e9 Nast in effect in 1962.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"17\">\n    <p id=\"p-204\">\n     The 1982 Agreement does not state whether Stern was at all times the owner of the copyright to the photos or whether, sometime after the sittings, he became owner on account of a transfer of rights from Cond\u00e9 Nast. The Court has no occasion to resolve that detail and nothing turns on it. The Court does note, however, that a formal, written contract would not have been necessary to establish a post-creation transfer.

The parties have represented that they have not uncovered any substantive evidence bearing on ownership beyond that presented on the summary judgment record. Insofar as no issues of witness credibility bear on this issue, the Court can today assess the weight of the evidence. The Court therefore alternatively holds that the weight of the evidence presented overwhelmingly demonstrates that Stern owned the copyright to the Last Sitting photographs.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"19\">\n    <p id=\"p-206\">\n     These letters\n     <em>\n      are\n     </em>\n     likely admissible as evidence of the parties' course of dealing, but they are ultimately of little probative value as to that point: Cond\u00e9 Nast continued to license rights to Last Sitting works from Stern during the period in which this correspondence took place, and as described in the text, the letters provide at best conflicting evidence of the parties' dealings.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"20\">\n    <p id=\"p-207\">\n     This ruling as to ownership of the photographs binds only the parties to this lawsuit: plaintiffs and the Lavenders.

That argument must be denied. These are quintessential disputes of fact that appear likely to turn on questions of credibility. Thus, although the Court serves as finder of fact in this case, it cannot resolve this dispute without the benefit live testimony at trial.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"22\">\n    <p id=\"p-209\">\n     The Court understands this form of infringement to form a part of plaintiffs' claims in Counts One and Two.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"23\">\n    <p id=\"p-210\">\n     Plaintiffs forcefully dispute this factual claim.
