He claims that these officials violated his First Amendment rights by persuading a private group-the Veterans of Foreign Wars-to terminate his volunteer relationship in response to Mr. Storms writing an article full of damning accusations against the Department. But the Supreme Court has not authorized a suit for damages based on the First Amendment and warns that extending such remedies to new contexts is \"a disfavored judicial activity.\"\n   <em>\n    Ziglar v.

BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On March 6, 2014, Mr. Storms published an article entitled \"How veterans can fight back against VA abuse,\" on the Daily Caller website.

It called for veterans to sue agency officials for damages, including then-current Secretary Eric Shinseki, whom Mr. Storms blamed for helping to create a corrupt agency culture.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604999\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1843/#p1848\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The piece quickly went viral. Compl. \u00b6 12. Mr. Storms-a former U.S. Marine-was then serving as the Vice-Legislative Chairman for the Veterans of Foreign Wars, New York Department (VFW-NY), and the article identified him as such.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 5, 14, Ex. 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   That night, Defendant Kevin Secor-the VA's Veterans Service Organizations Liaison officer, Compl. \u00b6 8-exchanged emails with the Executive Director of the national Veterans of Foreign Wars organization, Bob Wallace.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15, Ex. 5. Mr. Secor asked Mr. Wallace if he knew that the article was going to be published,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 5, and when Mr. Wallace assured him that \"[t]his is not the VFW position,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 6, Mr. Secor told him that \"any help would\n   be appreciated, I know this will be a topic at tomorrow's stand-up.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The next day, both the VA and the VFW moved quickly. Mr. Secor sent an email asking Raymond Kelley-another VFW official- \"did you see what your Legislative Vice Chairman wrote in the Daily Caller?\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 10. Mr. Storms alleges that Mr. Secor met with Secretary Shinseki, Defendant Jose Riojas (then the VA's Assistant Secretary for Operations, Security, and Preparedness), and \"John/Jane Does 1-100.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21. These individuals jointly resolved to \"discredit and defame\" Mr. Storms and terminate him from his VFW-NY position, to undermine the op-ed, deter similar articles from Mr. Storms or others, and protect Secretary Shinseki.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Mr. Secor also allegedly called Mr. Wallace and demanded that the VFW publish a rebuttal article and end Mr. Storms' status as a Vice Legislative Chairman.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25. The VFW's Commander-in-Chief emailed the Daily Caller that same day with a proposed rebuttal piece,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 12, and Mr. Wallace forwarded the email to Assistant Secretary Riojas and Mr. Secor.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Three days later, VFW-NY removed Mr. Storms from his position as Legislative Vice Chairman,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 15 and asked him to write a letter of apology for his article.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 16. Although Mr. Storms does not allege that he was salaried, the termination meant that he would not be reimbursed for future VFW travel.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 17. Because of his termination, Mr. Storms allegedly suffered various injuries, including chilled speech, emotional damages, lost employment opportunities within the VFW, and reputational harm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Mr. Storms then sued Secretary Shinseki, Assistant Secretary Riojas, Mr. Secor, and 100 unidentified \"John/Jane Does,\" all in their individual capacities.

Any \"meaningful\" difference between a prior\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   context and the case at issue makes the context new, including:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   the rank of the officers involved; the constitutional right at issue; the generality or specificity of the official action; the extent of judicial guidance as to how an officer should respond to the problem or emergency to be confronted; the statutory or other legal mandate under which the officer was operating; the risk of disruptive intrusion by the Judiciary into the functioning of other branches; or the presence of potential special factors that previous\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   cases did not consider.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1859-60. If the context is not new, then existing\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   precedent controls. But if the context is new, then courts must ask whether \"special factors\" counsel against implying a damages action based on a violation of a constitutional right.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1857. This inquiry \"must concentrate on whether the Judiciary is well suited, absent congressional action or instruction, to consider and weigh the costs and benefits of allowing a damages action to proceed.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1857-58. \"[I]f there are sound reasons to think Congress might doubt the efficacy or necessity of a damages remedy,\" then the Judiciary should defer and allow Congress to play its proper role.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1858.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   This case presents a new context.

But no damages remedy currently exists for the First Amendment retaliation that Mr. Storms describes, and it is the job of Congress to decide if such a remedy should be created. This conclusion applies equally to the named and unnamed Defendants, so the named Defendants' Motion to Dismiss will be granted and the Complaint will be dismissed. A separate order will issue.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    At this stage of the proceedings, I accept the Complaint's well-pled allegations as true.\n    <em>\n     Ashcroft v.
