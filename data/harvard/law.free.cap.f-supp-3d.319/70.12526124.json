Plaintiff Matthew Dunlap, Secretary of State of the State of Maine, was among the appointed commissioners. Over the following summer and early fall, the Commission held several meetings regarding election issues and collected some state voter data. Yet, despite his eagerness to contribute to the Commission's work, Plaintiff had reason to believe that Defendants and perhaps other commissioners were inhibiting his ability to fully do so. Plaintiff tried to obtain certain documents from the Commission to vindicate his rights, and when he was unsuccessful, he brought this lawsuit against the Commission, Vice President Michael R. Pence in his capacity as Chair of the Commission, Kris W. Kobach in his capacity as Vice Chair, the Executive Office of the President (\"EOP\"), and the Office of the Vice President (\"OVP\"), among others.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Unofficial information shortly thereafter suggested that the Commission might hold\n   a meeting without inviting Plaintiff's involvement in the planning. This precipitated his efforts to obtain preliminary relief, which this Court granted in significant part on December 22, 2017. The Court found that Plaintiff was likely to succeed in obtaining certain relief pursuant to the Court's mandamus jurisdiction,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201361\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and met the remaining elements for a preliminary injunction as to that relief.

In support of this argument, Defendants submit a declaration from Charles C. Herndon, the Director of White House Information Technology, indicating that \"[t]he Commission did not create any preliminary findings.\" 2d Decl. of Charles C. Herndon, ECF No. 39-2, \u00b6 5. It is undisputed that there is no published final report in this case, and the Court shall accept for a moment,\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   , that there are no preliminary findings either. Even so, this distinction is not persuasive.\n   <em>\n    Cummock\n   </em>\n   itself articulated the commissioner's separate rights 1) to review any documents to which she was entitled, as discussed above,\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   2) \"assuming that Cummock is entitled to review certain Commission documents to which she has heretofore been denied access, [to] be given an opportunity to amend and publish a dissent incorporating her fully enlightened views.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <em>\n    Cummock\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3669491,11662621\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/180/282/\">\n    180 F.3d at 293\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Under Defendants' reasoning, a former commissioner's right to documents under\n   <em>\n    Cummock\n   </em>\n   turns on the arbitrary fact of whether the commission published a report before its termination. But the Court of Appeals' decision clearly establishes otherwise. Full participation in the Commission would have involved the opportunity to contribute to a published report if there was one, but even where there is not, still Plaintiff's right must be vindicated to any remaining extent to which it was abridged.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Only upon Plaintiff's review of the documents generated by the Commission will the extent to which his participation was thwarted become clear. Why should the Plaintiff, a duly appointed member of that body, be expected to rely on the assertion of a records custodian that there are no \"preliminary findings\"? There is no claim that Mr. Herndon had a substantive role in the work of the Commission.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TRO Ancillary Issue Mem. at 7 n.10 (noting it is not \"clear what basis Mr. Herndon had to make this declaration, including what is meant by 'finding' in the declaration and whether Mr. Herndon, in his role as Director of White House Information Technology, was privy to all communications between DHS (or other federal agencies and officials) and the Chair, Vice Chair, Executive Director, and/or other Commission officials\"). Among those who did have such a substantive role, the Vice Chair, Mr. Kobach, was interviewed in preparation for a\n   <em>\n    Breitbart\n   </em>\n   article that ultimately stated that \"the voter fraud commission has revealed\" certain specific findings.

But this suggestion of findings cannot be skirted so easily. On behalf of the President, whose Executive Office was and indisputably remains a Defendant in this matter, the press secretary has stated that the President \"asked the Department of Homeland Security to review [the Commission's] initial findings.\" Statement, The White House,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   . President Trump likewise seemed to suggest that the issues entrusted to the Commission were still live topics, rather than dead-ends proven by an absence of findings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MTR Opp'n at 10 n.18 (quoting Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump), Twitter (Jan. 4, 2018) ) (\"Push hard for Voter Identification!\" (internal\n   quotation marks omitted) ). Defendants' effort to walk back public statements consists of the records custodian's assertion as well as a footnote addressing the\n   <em>\n    Breitbart\n   </em>\n   article referenced above:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   [T]he statement by Mr. Kobach appears to reference material that was presented to the Commission at its meetings, not findings by the Commission itself.

Perhaps there were draft findings or a draft report that simply were not deemed \"final.\" Or perhaps e-mails exist that informally characterize the results of the Commission's work. It is more difficult to envision a presidential commission, with paid staff, being terminated without\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   internal characterization of that commission's work over more than six months. In any event, now that the Commission is terminated, any findings, any report, or any internal characterization of the Commission's work is \"final\" from the perspective of the historical record that will be preserved in the National Archives pursuant to the Presidential Records Act (\"PRA\").\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   2d Decl. of Charles C. Herndon, ECF No. 39-2, \u00b6 5 (\"Non-public Commission records will continue to be maintained as Presidential Records.\"). Plaintiff is entitled to see for himself whether any documents that were generated can be considered \"findings\" by Commission staff or between certain of the commissioners and staff that, in lieu of a formal set of \"findings\" or formal final report, will be recorded for posterity in the Archives as the fruits of the Commission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   When Commission records preserved in the Archives under the PRA are made publicly accessible at the appointed time after the end of the Trump Administration, the documents themselves will represent to the public the findings and the report of the Commission. In the meantime, the press secretary's statement to the public-if not also Mr. Kobach's statements-takes the place of final findings and a final report.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff is entitled to see any such findings, report, or internal characterization that was not shared with him before it became the final work product of the Commission. In turn, Plaintiff may respond in public, if he chooses, to any such work product in what may be deemed for posterity\n   as an informal oral or written version of any alternative findings, or an informal concurring or dissenting report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The last reason for denying reconsideration is a matter of respect for the tribunal. Shutting down the Commission due to \"endless legal battles,\" Statement, The White House,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , and as part of an \"option play,\" TRO Mem. at 5 (quoting Tackett and Wines,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   ) (internal quotation marks omitted), suggests an effort to evade this Court's December 22, 2017, Order. Were it not so, the Court would have expected Defendants to pursue an interlocutory appeal, rather than termination of the Commission twelve days after this Court's preliminary injunction compelling a document production. They shall not be permitted to further postpone compliance with a preliminary injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   As in\n   <em>\n    Abraham\n   </em>\n   discussed above, termination of the Commission should not change the\n   <em>\n    ability\n   </em>\n   of Defendants to comply.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Abraham\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11348768\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/223/162/#p184\">\n    223 F.Supp.2d at 184\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Even before the Court's December 22, 2017, decision, Defendants had already reviewed and organized a number of Commission documents pursuant to court-ordered production of a\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   -type index in a related case before this Court involving the Commission.\n   <em>\n    Dunlap\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523075\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/286/96/\">\n    286 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   110 (citing\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   -type index in\n   <em>\n    Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law v.

Moreover, Defendants already offered to make available some of those documents for Plaintiff's inspection. Mem. in Opp'n to Pl.'s Mot. for a Prelim. Inj. Ex. G, ECF No. 30-7, at 2 (extending offer to inspect certain documents related to September 12, 2017, meeting). Defendants do not assert that they are no longer able to produce those documents or that they are unable to produce documents post-dating the\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   -type index. As discussed above, the White House records custodian's declaration suggests that they are all preserved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Defendants have not persuaded the Court that justice requires reconsideration. Accordingly, Defendants must produce the documents discussed in the Court's December 22, 2017, decision through the time of the Commission's termination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dunlap\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523075\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/286/96/\">\n    286 F.Supp.3d at 108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (giving guidance as to types of documents to which Plaintiff is entitled). For the avoidance of doubt, the Court makes clear that such production must include relevant documents listed on the\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   -type index as well as those generated or received afterwards.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   The covered time period includes relevant documents generated or received between the Court's December 22, 2017, decision and the Commission's termination. The Court has reason to believe that at least some such documents exist.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TRO Mem. at 8 n.11 (citing Allison Kite,\n   <em>\n    Kobach Voter Integrity Commission, Stalled by Lawsuits, Will Meet in January\n   </em>\n   , Topeka Capital-Journal (Dec. 29, 2017), http://cjonline.com/news/state-government/2017-12-29/kobach-voter-integrity-commissions-talled-lawsuits-will-meet). Plaintiff ultimately should receive relevant documents that\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   of the former commissioners generated or received. This includes material that commissioners solicited and subsequently received from third parties.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , TRO Ancillary Issue Opp'n at 10 n.1 (attributing certain statistics to one such third-party submission, albeit allegedly supplied at one or more Commission meetings). Defendants are\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   obligated,\n   however, to disclose any materials that were generated before the termination of the Commission but which exclusively concern document management after its termination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MTR Mem. at 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Application for Temporary Restraining Order &amp; Ancillary Request\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   In his TRO Application, Plaintiff seeks not only a further order compelling the relief granted by the Court's December 22, 2017, preliminary injunction, but also additional relief stemming directly from the Committee's dissolution. Any necessity for a TRO is much diminished, however, by the Court's denial today of Defendants' Motion to Reconsider that preliminary injunction. Plaintiff's fears, for example, that Defendants might publish a report or findings absent Court intervention simply have not materialized. None of the briefing of motions decided today-which fully ripened on February 21, 2018-identified any verifiable example of such report or findings since the Commission's January 3, 2018, termination. Nor has any party brought such publication to the Court's attention during the pendency of the motions decided today.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Plaintiff's fears came closest to realization when the White House Press Secretary announced that the Commission's \"initial findings\" would be given to DHS. Statement, The White House,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   . But the press secretary made this statement on the very day of the Commission's termination, when perhaps an assertion of findings was little more than hasty boilerplate. Reinforcing that possibility, the Court has observed a slightly different version of the press secretary's statement that is also in the record. The version attached to Andrew Kossack's January 3, 2018, email informing commissioners of the dissolution of the Commission refers to the President in the first person as instructing DHS to \"review these issues,\" rather than review \"initial findings.\" TRO Ancillary Issue Mem. Ex. 1, ECF No. 42-1. While it is unclear which version of the statement was produced first, at the very least the discrepancy appears to signal uncertainty as to the existence of any findings. Mr. Kobach may have referred to some information as findings on or about January 3, 2018.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Binder,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   . But as discussed above, these statements by the press secretary and any by Mr. Kobach are undercut by Mr. Herndon's declaration that \"[t]he Commission did not create any preliminary findings.\" 2d Decl. of Charles C. Herndon, ECF No. 39-2, \u00b6 5. And no more definitive revelations have been docketed with the Court since then.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   As set forth in full below, Plaintiff's requests in his TRO Application may be summarized in pertinent part as follows: (1) preservation of Commission documents; (2) Plaintiff's participation in Commission wind-down and document retention activities; (3) his participation in document transfer decisions; (4) an injunction against document transfer; (5) an injunction against dissemination or publication of a report or findings until Plaintiff has had an opportunity to respond; and (6) an order\n   that Defendants comply with the Court's December 22, 2017, Order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Appl. for a TRO, ECF No. 35, at 1-2. The Court also considers here Plaintiff's ancillary request to prohibit the unofficial transfer of official Commission records by former Commission officials.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Min. Order of Jan. 10, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Because the Court held the TRO Application in abeyance during its consideration of the Motion to Reconsider, the Court did not receive an opposition from Defendants (or reply from Plaintiff). But the salient information is contained in other briefing. Plaintiff's memorandum in support of his TRO, and the parties' full briefing of his ancillary request, sufficiently identify the issues to make clear that Plaintiff is not entitled to relief.

Counsel from the White House Counsel's Office has also\n   reached out to Mr. Kobach in his personal capacity, requesting that he not share with the Department of Homeland Security or any other federal entity, other than the White House for preservation purposes, any Commission records not otherwise made public, during the pendency of the plaintiff's motion.

The White House has tried to collect any Commission documents-official or otherwise-that it does not yet have. Philip C.

Droege, ECF No. 44-1, \u00b6\u00b6 3-4 (indicating that Mr. Droege would be \"sending a letter to all former Commissioners instructing them to forward to [his] office any documents that they created or received regarding Commission work that they [had] not already sent to the White House, to include [certain] text messages\" regarding \"administrative topics like scheduling\" that had not previously been collected (internal quotation marks omitted) ); Subpoena Opp'n at 2-3 (confirming that Mr. Droege sent this letter to all former commissioners, including Plaintiff and Mr. Kobach); Subpoena Opp'n Ex. A, ECF No. 49-1 (containing Plaintiff's copy of aforementioned letter sent by Mr. Droege).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   It is true that those representations do not cover all eventualities. For example, Defendants make no commitments regarding documents that former commissioners may have that have not yet been provided to the White House. Plaintiff objects to the implications of Defendants' argument that former commissioners, such as Mr. Kobach, are neither party to this case any longer nor subject to compulsion by Defendants now that the Commission has terminated.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , TRO Ancillary Issue Opp'n at 3-4 (asserting that \"individual former Commission members [who were sued only in official capacity] are no longer defendants as soon as they no longer have an official capacity\"); TRO Ancillary Issue Reply at 3 (arguing that \"the Government now takes the position ... that the best the Government can do is make a non-binding and non-enforceable 'request' ... that the individual commissioners forward documents for preservation to the White House\"). Plaintiff also notes that Mr. Droege seems to make no representation about maintenance of Commission documents generated after the\n   <em>\n    Vaughn-\n   </em>\n   type index was filed on September 29, 2017, in the\n   <em>\n    Lawyers' Committee\n   </em>\n   litigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TRO Ancillary Issue Reply at 2-4; Decl. of Philip C.

Plaintiff evidently fears the destruction of documents wherever Defendants have not expressly represented that they are ensuring preservation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   The Court is of the view that the President and Vice President must preserve more than what is listed on the\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   -type index, which purports to represent only the entitlement of the public to certain Commission documents at a specific point in time. It would seem that\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   Commission materials should be provided to the Archivist, whether during or upon the conclusion of this Administration, with the Archivist ultimately playing a significant role in determining what is to be preserved and released after the end of the Trump Administration.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202203\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f) (giving President (and Vice President) the option during Administration to entrust maintenance and preservation to Archivist);\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202203\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2203(g) (turning all responsibility over to Archivist after Administration). But the Court shall opine no further, because\n   <em>\n    Armstrong I\n   </em>\n   prohibits\n   this Court from evaluating whether the President and Vice President are fulfilling their obligations under the PRA with respect to Commission documents.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Even if the Court were not prohibited, the Court is not persuaded that this case, at least in its current posture, is the appropriate vehicle for adjudicating the President's obligations under the PRA to maintain Commission documents. The operative [1] Complaint chiefly concerns Plaintiff's role on the Commission. That Complaint does not-and could not at the time-make claims about post-termination management of Commission documents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff is not likely to succeed on the merits of his attempt to establish a right to intervene in the management of documents after the termination of the Commission, insofar as he seeks an order to preserve them (request (1) ), a role in activities regarding their disposition (request (2), in pertinent part), a role in discussions about their transfer (request (3) ), or an injunction against their transfer (request (4), and the ancillary request). Plaintiff was appointed to serve as a commissioner of a now-defunct commission; that appointment did not include an invitation to linger on afterwards-if Plaintiff thought necessary-as a\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   member of the White House records management team.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   One further word must be said about Plaintiff's ancillary request. Defendants argue that the Court is without jurisdiction over former Commission officials, such as Mr. Kobach. Defendants cite a ream of cases, most of which are not persuasive authority, for the proposition that suit cannot proceed against a former official who was sued only in his or her official capacity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TRO Ancillary Issue Opp'n at 4. The Court shall shortly consider this issue to some degree in the context of the Subpoena Motion, but the Court need not reach it here. The Court has resolved the document management requests in the TRO, including the ancillary request, on the grounds that Plaintiff does not have a right to insert himself into the post-dissolution management of Commission records, as this process is governed by the PRA. The Court need not evaluate Defendants' assertion that \"any dissemination [of Commission materials] by the now-decommissioned individuals [who formerly were Commission members] would not violate the Presidential Records Act or any other statute of which defendants are aware.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1. That is an issue of Defendants' interpretation of their PRA obligations, which the Court is unlikely, under\n   <em>\n    Armstrong I\n   </em>\n   , to be permitted to address. In any event, unofficial dissemination of the defunct Commission's materials is an issue not properly before this Court on the operative [1] Complaint. The issue of how to handle any copies of Commission documents that may reside with former commissioners alone is likewise an issue of Defendants' compliance with the PRA that the Court is not in a position to address.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TRO Ancillary Issue Reply at 4 (arguing that the United States' \"complete ownership\" of Presidential records requires that individual commissioners return their copies of such documents (citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=44%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202202\">\n    44 U.S.C. \u00a7 2202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks and emphasis omitted) ) ). The Court's finding that Plaintiff has no role in the document management he seeks means that the Court need not separately decide whether it still has jurisdiction over certain individuals who may have relevant documents but purportedly are no longer Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   b. Irreparable Harm, Balance of Equities, and the Public Interest\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Plaintiff has likewise failed to persuade the Court that he should prevail on the other elements of the test for a TRO. The Court need not re-hash its above description of Defendants' obligations under the PRA and their representations of efforts to comply. When Defendants are charged with,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , maintaining Commission records pursuant to the PRA, Plaintiff is not likely to sustain the irreparable harm, in the absence of a TRO, of alleged destruction of those documents. Nor could Plaintiff be irreparably harmed by an inability to participate in document management decisions, TRO Mem. at 8, when the President and Vice President, not Plaintiff, are charged with management of those documents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Plaintiff will still \" 'obtain[ ] in a timely fashion information vital to the current and ongoing debate' surrounding election and voter fraud,\" TRO Mem. at 9 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Elec.

Accordingly, Plaintiff's interest in participating in public dialogue-assuming\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   that such an interest is a legitimate consideration in this analysis-will be vindicated to the extent that the Court has found that he is entitled to some documents that would support that participation. This interest alone does not entitle him to the further document management he seeks in his TRO.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Plaintiff could be irreparably harmed if documents containing any \"findings\" or \"report\" were destroyed, inhibiting his ability to respond to them, as contemplated by the Court's denial of Defendants' Motion to Reconsider. But it is not plausible that any such findings or report will be destroyed while this litigation is pending, for at least three reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   First, Defendants' preservation initiatives are very likely to encompass any such findings or report, which presumably would be easily identified as Commission documents subject to preservation under the PRA, rather than peripheral documents at some risk of routine purge-absent litigation hold-or documents residing only in the possession of a former commissioner.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Notice of Correction to the Record, ECF No. 37, at 2 (conveying Defendants' representation that \"documents are being preserved in accordance with the litigation holds in place in this and other related litigation, and in any event are being preserved in accordance with the Presidential Records Act\"); TRO Ancillary Issue Mem.

Transfer entails preservation somewhere.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   And finally, the affidavit from Mr. Herndon, the Director of White House Information Technology, that disavows \"creat[ion] [of] any preliminary findings\"-limited though this representation may be-suggests that no official Commission\n   findings (and, accordingly, no report encompassing them) exist anyway.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2d Decl. of Charles C. Herndon, ECF No. 39-2, \u00b6 5. Accordingly, no transfer could take place. If that were not enough, Defendants' declaration confirms that no transfer to an agency (other than NARA, if necessary) will occur.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Defendants also indicate that Mr. Kobach agrees not to make such a transfer either of any non-public documents in his possession. TRO Ancillary Issue Opp'n at 14. However, the Court mentions Mr. Kobach's assurance only for completeness. The Court does not rely on Defendants' representation of Mr. Kobach's assent because the Court has not decided whether it still has jurisdiction over Mr. Kobach. Even if it did have jurisdiction, the Court has found that the President and Vice President-but not Plaintiff-are responsible for managing Commission documents pursuant to the PRA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   The balance of equities tips in favor of Defendants as well. As a former commissioner, Plaintiff has a general interest in the maintenance of documents created by the former Commission. That interest is reinforced by the Court's December 22, 2017, decision recognizing that Plaintiff is entitled to certain documents of which he has been deprived. But when it comes to management of documents after the Commission's termination, Defendants have a concrete interest in complying with document maintenance obligations imposed by the PRA. The Court is disinclined to interfere with Defendants' statutory obligations for the sake of Plaintiff's interest, which is loosely connected to the Court's own preliminary injunction. Moreover, the Court's denial of Defendants' Motion to Reconsider the preliminary injunction should vindicate the rights that Plaintiff does have regarding Commission documents; the scope of his legitimate interest in this further relief, in light of the foregoing discussion, is minimal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   The public's interest in this dispute is to ensure that pertinent documents concerning the Commission's life and work survive to see the light of day. Defendants' obligations under the PRA, coupled with their representations in this case, assure the Court that the public interest will be protected. The Court is not persuaded that the public interest will be better served by issuing a TRO that the Court does not otherwise find to be justified than by the alternative: enforcing the Court's preliminary injunction with its more limited scope and ultimately resolving the remainder of this dispute on the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   The foregoing analysis demonstrates that Plaintiff has not carried his burden to prove that he is entitled to a TRO granting him the document management relief that he requests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   <em>\n    2. Plaintiff's Participation in Commission Wind-Down Activities\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   As part of his request (2), Plaintiff seeks a Court order compelling \"Defendants to permit Secretary Dunlap to fully participate, on an equal basis as any other commissioner, in all remaining Commission activities, including but not limited to the winding down of the Commission.\" Pl.'s Appl. for a TRO, ECF No. 35, at 2. Plaintiff represents the wind-down aspect as a subcomponent of any \"remaining Commission activities.\" The Commission is no more, however, and so there are no further Commission activities as such. The Court considers only Plaintiff's request specifically to participate in wind-down activities, and only insofar as any such activities can remain after dissolution of the Commission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Setting aside decisions about documents and data, which the Court elsewhere considers,\n   it is not clear what kind of wind-down activities remain (or remained at the time Plaintiff's TRO Application was filed). The Court shall not specifically fault Plaintiff where details of any such wind-down may reside only with Defendants, but the absence of detail does undermine his ability to discharge his burden.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Plaintiff is not likely to succeed on the merits of proving that he should be allowed to participate in any wind-down. Just as Plaintiff's appointment to the Commission did not entail an informal appointment to the White House records team after his service, so he was not informally deemed an official of the EOP or OVP who is now responsible for any remaining wind-down.\n   <em>\n    Cummock\n   </em>\n   did not create any such entitlement. It is unclear, too, how Plaintiff could be irreparably harmed by depriving him of a right to participate in the wind-down of a defunct organization of which he is no longer a member by operation of the organization's status. The documents are properly his concern, and the Court elsewhere deals with those. Defendants' legitimate interest in wrapping up the affairs of the Commission in an orderly fashion clearly outweighs the interest of Plaintiff, now a member of the public, in intervening on some grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   The public's interest here is rather ambiguous. The Court supposes that the American people would be concerned more with the former Commission's documents than with any wind-down that does not in some way concern those documents. The potential caveat is decisions about who should carry the torch, as it were, of further inquiry into election integrity. If Plaintiff is any indication, the public would be interested in those decisions. But the determination of whether DHS or another agency, if any, continues to perform work that the Commission had engaged in during its existence is a decision for the President, who constituted the Commission, not for the Plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Plaintiff has not established a preliminary entitlement to participate in wind-down of the former Commission's affairs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   <em>\n    3. Injunction Against Dissemination or Publication of a Report or Findings Until Plaintiff Has Had an Opportunity to Respond\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   In his request (5), Plaintiff would have the Court \"enjoin[ ] Defendants from disseminating or publishing any initial, preliminary, or final findings or report of the Commission until such time as Secretary Dunlap has been provided with all Commission documents to which he is entitled, given a meaningful opportunity to participate in deliberations that lead to the findings, and has been given a reasonable amount of time in which to draft comments, a concurrence, or dissent to the findings or report.\" Pl.'s Appl. for a TRO, ECF No. 35, at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Of the claims in his TRO, this one comes closest to the scenario that occurred in\n   <em>\n    Cummock\n   </em>\n   and was the concern of this Court in its December 22, 2017, Order. In each instance, a commission concluded without permitting a commissioner to fully participate in its proceedings along the way. But the crucial difference is that the\n   <em>\n    Cummock\n   </em>\n   commission had produced a final report before its doors were closed. The plaintiff commissioner had dissented from that report, but the Court of Appeals recognized a further right to amend her dissent upon receiving any information to which she was entitled but had been denied.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cummock\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3669491,11662621\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/180/282/\">\n    180 F.3d at 286-87, 292-93\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . There is no published majority report here, unlike in\n   <em>\n    Cummock\n   </em>\n   . And it is not clear that any findings have been circulated either. Nor has the state data been consulted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Even though some type of report, or underlying findings, may lurk in the non-public Commission documents, the Court finds that an injunction against their dissemination or publication is either unnecessary, or at least still premature.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dunlap\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523075\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/286/96/\">\n    286 F.Supp.3d at 109\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The request to temporarily enjoin the final report is similarly premature, insofar as it assumes that Defendants will not provide the required documents in a timely fashion.\"). First, there is no Commission left to carry out the Commission's obligation to issue a report to the President.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   May 11, 2017 Exec. Order \u00a7 3 (\"The Commission ... shall submit a report to the President ....\"). Second, although Defendants did not follow through by providing the documents compelled by the preliminary injunction in a timely fashion, the Court today enforces their compliance. Plaintiff will be able to vindicate his right to fully participate by reviewing-and, if need be, responding to-the documents contained in Defendants' forthcoming production. Lastly, the Court reiterates that, in the period since briefing concluded, the parties have not given any indication that Defendants may move forward with a report or findings. Accordingly, Plaintiff is not likely at this time to succeed on the merits of a claim that he is entitled to an injunction against dissemination or publication of a report or findings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   Nor is there any appreciable likelihood of irreparable harm. Defendants' representations render it unlikely that Defendants have any findings or report to release, and likewise unlikely-recall the \"endless legal battles\" to which the press secretary expressly adverted-that they would do so pending the merits in this case, if not also in others. Plaintiff's ability soon to consult the documents compelled by the Court's December 22, 2017, preliminary injunction further diminishes any likelihood that he would be prejudiced by denying this additional injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   Neither side of this dispute appears to have markedly greater equities here. Plaintiff's desire to prevent dissemination or publication of findings or a report to which he could not fully contribute is a legitimate one. He still has an \"interest in contributing his unique perspective\" to the Commission to which he was appointed, and \"gaining the 'recognition and even prestige' of full participation in such a commission.\"\n   <em>\n    Dunlap\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523075\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/286/96/\">\n    286 F.Supp.3d at 110\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Cummock\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3669491,11662621\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/180/282/\">\n    180 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   292 ). But Plaintiff will have his opportunity, under the December 22, 2017, preliminary injunction, to review Commission documents to see whether there are any informal findings or draft report on which he wishes to informally comment in the public square.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TRO Mem. at 10 (arguing that Plaintiff \"is still entitled to draft and publish a 'dissent incorporating [his] fully enlightened views' responding to the statements published in the press by President Trump and Vice-Chair Kobach\" (citing\n   <em>\n    Cummock\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3669491,11662621\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/180/282/\">\n    180 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   293 ) ). For their part, Defendants of course would want to avoid the imposition of an expansive further injunction, especially when the injunction which the Court shall now enforce may ultimately have the same effect. Even if Plaintiff's equities were greater than Defendants', prevailing on this prong would not make up for Plaintiff's inability to carry his burden as to the likelihood of success or likelihood of irreparable harm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   The public's interest would seem to lie in efficient resolution of this matter, together with the release of any Commission documents evidencing informal findings or a draft report. Without a greater showing that findings or a report likely exist, in the Court's view the public is better served by avoiding duplicative orders in the interest of focusing on the\n   document production to which Plaintiff is entitled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Plaintiff cannot discharge his burden on this claim either.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   <em>\n    4. Order to Comply with the Court's December 22, 2017, Order\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   Lastly, in his request (6), Plaintiff asks the Court to \"order[ ] Defendants to produce without further delay the documents required by the Court's December 22, 2017 Order and requested in Secretary Dunlap's January 4, 2018 letter to counsel for Defendants.\" Pl.'s Appl. for a TRO, ECF No. 35, at 2. It is not clear whether this request seeks more than the preliminary injunction entitles Plaintiff to, and for the reasons set forth above, Plaintiff is not likely to succeed in proving that he is entitled to more than that. The Court supposes that the request to \"produce without further delay,\" attempts to add some urgency to the Court's preliminary injunction. But because the Court's Order accompanying this Memorandum Opinion shall add that urgency by other means, Plaintiff is not likely to be irreparably harmed by denial of this request in the TRO. The balance of equities tilts in favor of subjecting Defendants to only one Court order pertaining to the Court's December 22, 2017, Order, namely that Order itself, unburdened by this more-or-less redundant command. Plaintiff's interest is served by other means, chiefly enforcement of the December 22, 2017, preliminary injunction. The public's interest in ensuring that the documents ordered by the Court are produced will be vindicated without this further command. The Court finds that Plaintiff is not entitled to this essentially redundant preliminary relief in light of the Court's decision to deny Defendants' Motion to Reconsider the preliminary injunction. Plaintiff might in any event agree that such further relief is moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Motion for Leave to Serve Subpoena\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   Plaintiff seeks leave to serve a subpoena on Mr. Kobach that would require him to preserve, or produce at an unspecified future time, any Commission-related documents in his possession. Subpoena Mem. at 1, 10. It is not fully clear whether Plaintiff intends such a subpoena to apply solely during the pendency of Defendants' Motion to Reconsider, or rather throughout the pendency of the merits of this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 6 (arguing that \"there is a strong likelihood ... that the White House is not in possession of all documents to which the Court's December 22 Decision applies,\n   <em>\n    or which might otherwise be relevant to this litigation\n   </em>\n   \" (emphasis added) ). Erring on the side of caution, the Court assumes the latter. Even upon denial of the Motion to Reconsider, Plaintiff presumably would be interested in the preservation of documents by Mr. Kobach, particularly because the Court has not decided whether Mr. Kobach remains a Defendant in this matter. The Court again finds the issue of Mr. Kobach's status in this case to be not properly before the Court in this posture-rather than in a motion to dismiss-but the Court need not resolve it in order to dispose of the present motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   Ordinarily, the Court would consider whether Plaintiff's request for leave to serve a subpoena satisfies Rule 45's \"undue burden\" standard, to which Rule 26 adds additional limitations that are standard in the discovery context.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Watts\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3562179,3866332\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/482/501/\">\n    482 F.3d at 509\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But Plaintiff's request arrives before this Court has held an initial scheduling conference with the parties pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 16(b) and discussed the parameters of discovery. Generally such expedited discovery is not permissible, though the Court may grant an exception.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(d) (recognizing that early discovery exceptions include court approval). The decision\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   to permit expedited discovery is, of course, also squarely within the Court's broad discretion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Watts\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3562179,3866332\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/482/501/\">\n    482 F.3d at 507\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Crawford-El\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11503978\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/523/574/#p598\">\n    523 U.S. at 598\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11503978\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/523/574/#p598\">\n    118 S.Ct. 1584\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ) (indicating that Rule 26\"vests the trial judge with broad discretion to tailor discovery narrowly and to dictate the sequence of discovery\"). The Court shall proceed to consider Plaintiff's purported grounds for obtaining expedited discovery. Only upon a finding that expedited discovery is warranted would the Court turn to assess under Rule 45 (and Rule 26 ) the burden that such discovery would impose on Mr. Kobach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   At the threshold, the Court observes that the Federal Rules expressly permit a document production subpoena but do not provide for a document preservation subpoena.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 45(a)(1)(A)(iii) (including among a seemingly exhaustive list of potential subpoena contents a command to \"\n   <em>\n    produce\n   </em>\n   designated documents, electronically stored information, or tangible things in that person's possession, custody, or control\" (emphasis added) ). Plaintiff's argument effectively admits as much:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-138\">\n   [T]here is no reason why the authority of district courts to permit the issuance of a document production subpoena pursuant to Rule 45 should not also encompass the lesser authority to issue a document preservation subpoena where appropriate, which would impose a lesser burden on the third party than production.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   Subpoena Mem. at 5. Plaintiff urges the Court to bootstrap the authority of Rule 45 into permitting what that rule does not expressly provide, citing two strands of case law in support.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   Plaintiff's first context for a document preservation subpoena is litigation under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act (\"PSLRA\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4. That statute requires that \"all discovery and other proceedings shall be stayed during the pendency of any motion to dismiss [in covered private securities litigation], unless the court finds upon the motion of any party that particularized discovery is necessary to preserve evidence or to prevent undue prejudice to that party.\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-4(b)(3)(B). But FACA contains no comparable provision for staying discovery subject to exceptions. Nor does this case raise the kind of concerns that prompted Congress to address discovery in legislation specific to securities litigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Vivendi Universal, S.A.

Now that the Commission has been terminated, the disposition of Commission documents is generally governed by the PRA, which for present purposes is beyond the scope of judicial review. Commission documents are also subject to the Court's December 22, 2017, preliminary injunction, of course, which impliedly requires document preservation to facilitate compliance. If any Commission documents have been destroyed following the issuance of that preliminary injunction, and if the Court determines that Plaintiff was entitled to such documents under the injunction, then Defendants could well be subject to a finding of contempt for failure to comply with obligations created by that injunction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants, particularly the EOP and OVP, would be wise to do all within their power to preserve documents in accordance with the PRA and the December 22, 2017, preliminary injunction. If they are not confident that they can comply through the combination of efforts that they have represented to the Court, then they ought to go further, e.g., to issue a subpoena of their own to the individual former commissioners.

This Court likewise adopts the reasonableness test, recognizing that it is not only more consonant with the Court's discretion in discovery matters in general but also more consistent with the good cause standard for issuing a protective order, an arguably analogous context.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(c)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   Whether the Court contemplates a document preservation subpoena or, in the alternative, a document production subpoena, the reasonableness inquiry is largely the same, though the Court shall differentiate as needed. First, the preliminary injunction entered on December 22, 2017, militates against a further order compelling document preservation or production. The Court's enforcement of this injunction in short order shall ensure that the documents to which Plaintiff is entitled are furnished by Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   Plaintiff's sprawling list of nineteen specific document categories likely would render compliance with this subpoena rather difficult, even assuming Mr. Kobach has diligently maintained the documents at issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   List of Documents to Be Preserved and/or Produced Pursuant to Subpoena, ECF No. 48-6, at 3-5. And it is not clear that Plaintiff even would be entitled to all of the documents that he seeks to subpoena. For example, he may not be entitled to all of the \"Documents concerning ... how Documents should be treated upon the Commission's closure or termination,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 5, if some of those documents concern the President's or Vice President's document management obligations under the PRA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   While Plaintiff wants this subpoena to prevent document destruction, it is not clear that he has anything substantial to fear. Plaintiff evidently presumes that some Commission documents reside with Mr. Kobach, or others, that have not been collected by the President's or Vice President's records management staff.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Subpoena Mem. at 6 (\"[T]here is a strong likelihood-undisputed by DOJ-that the White House is not in possession of all documents to which the Court's December 22 Decision applies, or which might otherwise be relevant to this litigation.\").\n   <em>\n    But see\n   </em>\n   Subpoena Opp'n at 2 (describing Defendants' September 2017 records collection efforts). Plaintiff would have to believe that Mr. Kobach did not comply with PRA training in July 2017 in which the commissioners were \"instructed to copy the Commission's former Designated Federal Officer [Andrew Kossack], or the Commission's email account, on all communications.\" Subpoena Opp'n at 2. Plaintiff's motion further assumes that Mr. Kobach will not comply with litigation holds in this and related litigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Notice of Correction to the Record, ECF No. 37, at 2; TRO Ancillary Issue Mem. Ex. 1, ECF No. 42-1.

Kan. June 18, 2018) (imposing further sanction for Secretary Kobach's \"pattern and practice ... of flaunting disclosure and discovery rules\"). But the Court is not prepared to assume that Mr. Kobach would disregard the White House's requests when other Defendants-and he too, if the Court finds that he remains a Defendant-are at risk of contempt if they irresponsibly lose documents to which the Court finds that Plaintiff was entitled under the December 22, 2017, Order. Should it come to light that Mr. Kobach has Commission documents that he has not provided to other Defendants, and that other Defendants do not have their own copies of such documents, then Plaintiff may seek further relief from this Court as appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   The burden of compliance with this subpoena could be significant. That burden might not fall on Defendants, per se, as\n   <em>\n    Guttenberg\n   </em>\n   suggests that the Court consider. But for these purposes, it is appropriate to consider the potential burden on Mr. Kobach himself, whether or not he remains a Defendant. Mr. Kobach would have to go to the effort of ensuring that every document responsive to all nineteen of Plaintiff's categories is safeguarded for preservation or production. Plaintiff's subpoena would further burden Mr. Kobach because its boilerplate definitions are expansive. They dictate that the term \"Document(s)\" be interpreted \"in the\n   <em>\n    broadest possible sense\n   </em>\n   as interpreted under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure ... whether in hard copy, handwritten, printed, electronic, or other form.\" List of Documents to Be Preserved and/or Produced Pursuant to Subpoena, ECF No. 48-6, at 1 (emphasis added). Actual production of those documents, if the Court granted the Subpoena Motion in that form, would entail further time and expense. Even though Plaintiff has offered to permit Mr. Kobach to produce the documents at a later date in such a circumstance, Subpoena Mem. at 10, Mr. Kobach still would have to shoulder the burden of isolating all documents that may be responsive to Plaintiff's request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   And this request comes well in advance of typical discovery. Defendants have yet to file a response to Plaintiff's [1] Complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Min. Order of Jan. 10, 2018\n   (staying this obligation until further order). It is unknown whether the Court shall be able to proceed shortly upon Defendants' filing of an answer or whether the Court shall need to entertain briefing of a motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   The Court finds that, for the manifold reasons above, Plaintiff has not carried his burden of persuading the Court that it would be reasonable to grant expedited discovery in the form of leave to serve a subpoena on Mr. Kobach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   <strong>\n    D.

MTR Mem. at 12-13. Presumably their request would fall within the scope of Rule 62(c) if they had already filed their appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 62(c) (\"While an appeal is pending from an interlocutory order ... that grants ... an injunction, the court may suspend ... an injunction ....\").

But neither side adequately briefs the application of the basic four-factor standard for a stay pending appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cuomo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3601939,306771\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/772/972/\">\n    772 F.2d at 974\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, the Court forges ahead with its application of that\n   <em>\n    Cuomo\n   </em>\n   standard largely based on its own examination of the relevant authorities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   First, Defendants have not sustained their burden to prove a likelihood of success on appeal. In its December 22, 2017, decision, the Court found that\n   <em>\n    Cummock\n   </em>\n   entitles Plaintiff to the documents at issue. Today the Court has determined that dissolution of the Commission does not entitle Defendants to reconsideration of the preliminary injunction. It follows from those two decisions that the Court views Defendants as unlikely to succeed on appeal. It is true that a \"serious legal question\" could help tip the scales on this factor when the likelihood of success on appeal is low.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Al-Anazi\n   </em>\n   , 370 F.Supp.2d at 193 &amp; n.5. But that option is available only where the movants would otherwise prevail on the harm prong,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , which the Court shall find below is not the case here.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Special Proceedings\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4220917\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/840/370/#p372\">\n    840 F.Supp.2d 370\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 372 (D.D.C. 2012) (citing, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Holiday Tours, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , 559 F.2d at 844 ) (finding that \"serious legal question\" standard replaces likelihood of success on the merits \"only when the other three factors tip sharply in the movant's favor\"). The fact that the likelihood of success and irreparable harm prongs are subject to a sliding scale,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cuomo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3601939,306771\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/772/972/\">\n    772 F.2d at 974\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , does not, of course, mean that the movants can avoid the conclusion that they failed to adequately prove both of them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   Defendants argue that enforcement of the preliminary injunction before they could seek appellate review would work irreparable damage, MTR Mem. at 13, but their reasoning appears to apply, at most, to only a subset of the documents at issue. Of note, Defendants say nothing about any privileged, classified, or otherwise sensitive documents in the portion of their Motion to Reconsider requesting a stay pending appeal.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   note 6 (citing\n   <em>\n    Cummock\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3669491,11662621\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/180/282/\">\n    180 F.3d at 293\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Rogers, J., concurring) ). Rather, Defendants elsewhere point to the \"sensitive and privileged information\" contained in \"forward-looking documents related to the disposition of data collected by a now-dissolved Commission.\" MTR Mem. at 12 (asserting that Plaintiff's \"request\n   would insert a non-federal employee into sensitive internal government discussions about the proper disposition of records in compliance with federal law, and may also touch upon internal security practices and litigation-related obligations\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   MTR Reply at 9. But these are not the kinds of documents to which the Court found Plaintiff to be entitled in the Court's December 22, 2017, decision, nor in today's decision to deny reconsideration of it. Evidently some documents predating the Commission's termination are privileged as well.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , TRO Ancillary Issue Opp'n at 12 n.4 (\"Some documents on the\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   -like index are clearly privileged (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , internal discussion with counsel), but there is no indication that former Commissioners are in possession of any such documents, with the possible exception of litigation-related documents sent to Mr. Kobach in his former capacity as Vice Chair.\"). But Plaintiff appears not to seek those privileged documents. ECF No. 46-3, app. A at 12 (disclaiming Plaintiff's interest in entries on\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   -type index consisting of \"[l]itigation-related documents exchanged between named defendants and DOJ\"). Plaintiff is entitled only to the documents discussed in the Court's December 22, 2017, decision, which did not contemplate documents concerning post-termination records management.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dunlap\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523075\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/286/96/\">\n    286 F.Supp.3d at 108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Defendants likewise should not be disturbed by Plaintiff's effort, in his TRO Application, to participate in document management decisions, as the Court has denied that relief. Moreover, as the Court has permitted above, Defendants may withhold documents generated before the termination of the Commission that exclusively concern document management after its termination. That limited carve out would appear to encompass all of the documents about which Defendants have presently expressed specific concerns.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   Defendants' failure to argue that\n   <em>\n    any other\n   </em>\n   documents are sensitive is consistent with prior proceedings in this case: Defendants already offered, prior to the Court's December 22, 2017, decision, to make certain documents available for Plaintiff's in-person review.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dunlap\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523075\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/286/96/\">\n    286 F.Supp.3d at 103-04\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Defendants offered to permit Plaintiff to inspect, in person, documents related to the September 12, 2017, meeting [of the Commission], but he would not be provided with copies, nor would he be permitted to take notes.\"). Their willingness to let Plaintiff see certain documents, absent a court order compelling them to do so, suggests that Defendants are not concerned about their content. If Defendants were in fact concerned about the content of other documents that they did not offer to show Plaintiff, then it would have behooved them to say so in briefing the Motion to Reconsider. The Court presumes that Defendants are troubled, not about the content of documents they did not address, but rather by the Court's finding, on December 22, 2017, that Plaintiff has a\n   <em>\n    right\n   </em>\n   to certain Commission documents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   If Defendants truly are concerned only about the precedential effect of a finding that Plaintiff is entitled to documents under\n   <em>\n    Cummock\n   </em>\n   , then the delivery of those documents pending appeal would not work any irreparable injury. A finding by the Court of Appeals that Plaintiff is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   entitled to the documents would remedy Defendants' legal concern by establishing the precedent they desire. In such an event, Plaintiff could simply be required to return the documents to Defendants for lack of entitlement to them. The Court can only speculate as to putative harms that the Defendants could suffer in the meantime-e.g., responding to comments that Plaintiff may make to the press-but finds it unlikely\n   that any such \"harms\" would be irreparable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   The Court also finds that release of the documents would not moot any appeal, as Defendants' conclusory citations are meant to suggest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MTR Mem. at 12-13. In\n   <em>\n    Church of Scientology of California v.

Even after delivery of the tapes, the appellate court could grant some relief, the Supreme Court found:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-161\">\n   While a court may not be able to return the parties to the\n   <em>\n    status quo ante\n   </em>\n   -there is nothing a court can do to withdraw all knowledge or information that IRS agents may have acquired by examination of the tapes-a court can fashion\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   form of meaningful relief in circumstances such as these. Taxpayers have an obvious possessory interest in their records. When the Government has obtained such materials as a result of an unlawful summons, that interest is violated and a court can effectuate relief by ordering the Government to return the records. Moreover, even if the Government retains only copies of the disputed materials, a taxpayer still suffers injury by the Government's continued possession of those materials, namely, the affront to the taxpayer's privacy. A person's interest in maintaining the privacy of his \"papers and effects\" is of sufficient importance to merit constitutional protection. Indeed, that the Church considers the information contained on the disputed tapes important is demonstrated by the long, contentious history of this litigation. Even though it is now too late to prevent, or to provide a fully satisfactory remedy for, the invasion of privacy that occurred when the IRS obtained the information on the tapes,\n   <em>\n    a court does have power to effectuate a partial remedy by ordering the Government to destroy or return any and all copies it may have in its possession. The availability of this possible remedy is sufficient to prevent this case from being moot\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12-13,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11924854\" index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/506/9/#p10\">\n    113 S.Ct. 447\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (final emphasis added; footnotes omitted). As in\n   <em>\n    Church of Scientology\n   </em>\n   , so upon any successful appeal in this case, the Court of Appeals could still craft a remedy that grants some relief to Defendants. At the very least, Plaintiff could be compelled to return all copies of documents provided to him in compliance with the Court's preliminary injunction. While there may not be a privacy interest comparable to\n   <em>\n    Church of Scientology\n   </em>\n   , that case articulated a second interest-the taxpayer's \"obvious possessory interest\"-that has an analogue here. If the Court of Appeals were to order Plaintiff to return Commission documents to Defendants, that would seem to vindicate an obvious possessory interest in Commission documents that the President and Vice President, and by extension, Defendants EOP and OVP, are required to maintain pursuant to the PRA.\n   <em>\n    Church of Scientology\n   </em>\n   is clear that even if Plaintiff retains some knowledge or information derived from the documents that he is provided, that is not enough to render wholly ineffectual the relief of returning the documents. Because\n   this situation is analogous to the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Church of Scientology\n   </em>\n   , the Court finds strong authority that delivery of the documents in this case would\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   moot any appeal of the Court's preliminary injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   The harm to Plaintiff of a stay pending appeal is the harm of further delaying the limited means-under the Court's preliminary injunction-by which he can still vindicate his right to fully participate in the Commission. The Court shall not recapitulate here its description of the kind of informal alternative findings or informal concurring or dissenting report that he may choose to issue to the public. Plaintiff would have received the documents necessary to vindicate that right shortly after December 22, 2017, had the Court not needed to decide the Motion to Reconsider. If Defendants had promptly delivered the documents, then much of the separate relief that Plaintiff sought-in the form of the TRO, ancillary request, and subpoena-could have been prevented too. That said, if Defendants are merely required to show that \"issuance of the stay will not cause\n   <em>\n    substantial\n   </em>\n   harm\" to Plaintiff,\n   <em>\n    United States v.
