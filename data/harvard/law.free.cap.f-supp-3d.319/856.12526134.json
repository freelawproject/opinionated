Application\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Defendants argue they are entitled to summary judgment because Plaintiffs' claims for unpaid overtime are barred under\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   and by the statute of limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   First, Defendants argue that when DCDC compelled arbitration in 2015 in the earlier case between these parties, when the Court issued an order compelling arbitration, the order stated that \"excepting the limited judicial review permitted by the Federal Arbitration Act, Plaintiffs' claims in this case are dismissed with prejudice.\" 5:14-CV-17-DAE, Docket no. 34. Defendants argue this order was a final judgment that dismissed Plaintiffs' claims with prejudice, and because those claims are the same issues in the present case, Plaintiffs' claims in this case are barred under\n   <em>\n    res judicata.\n   </em>\n   But as discussed in open court, arbitration did not proceed to resolution on the merits. Nothing in the Court's order compelling arbitration indicated that Plaintiffs' claims were dismissed with prejudice on the merits. This Court is not aware of any binding authority that suggests that Plaintiffs' claims are barred under\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   where the earlier case was dismissed, sent to arbitration, but no final arbitration decision was made on the merits. Thus, the Court finds that Plaintiffs' claims are not barred under\n   <em>\n    res judicata.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Next, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs' claims are time-barred. An action for unpaid overtime compensation under the FLSA must be commenced within two years after the cause of action accrued, unless that cause of action arises out of a willful violation, in which case it must be commenced within three years after the cause of action accrued.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20255\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Defendants argue that the latest possible date that Plaintiffs' cause of action could have accrued is the payday following their last day of employment with DCDC, which was in July 2014. Defendants argue that Plaintiffs would have had to file their complaint by July 2017 at the latest, but because this action was not commenced until March 20, 2018, Plaintiffs' claims are time-barred. But as discussed in open court, the attempts at arbitration did not\n   completely fall through until January 2018. Plaintiffs, thus, argue that they are entitled to equitable tolling because they were subject to the court-ordered arbitration and only commenced the present action because the arbitration fell through, specifically after DCDC failed to pay arbitration costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Court finds that Plaintiffs are entitled to equitable tolling. The doctrine of equitable tolling \"is read into every federal statute of limitation.\"\n   <em>\n    Torabi v. Gonzales\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1030831\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/165/326/#p331\">\n    165 F.

The Court finds that the circumstances here warrant equitable tolling. Plaintiffs were unable to pursue their claims any further while arbitration was ongoing, and after arbitration was terminated, Plaintiffs diligently pursued their rights by filing the present action. Thus, the Court finds that Plaintiffs' claims are not time-barred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

The Fifth Circuit has articulated a three-step analysis for determining whether a court has specific jurisdiction over a defendant: \"(1) whether the defendant has minimum contacts with the forum state, i.e., whether it purposely directed its activities toward\n   the forum state or purposefully availed itself of the privileges of conducting activities there; (2) whether the plaintiff's cause of action arises out of or results from the defendant's forum-related contacts; and (3) whether the exercise of personal jurisdiction is fair and reasonable.\"\n   <em>\n    McFadin v.

Specific jurisdiction also requires a sufficient nexus between the non-resident's contacts with the forum and the cause of action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Application\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In their motion, Defendants argue RDC and the Reddochs are not subject to general jurisdiction because Plaintiffs fail to allege any facts or contacts contributable to them to justify an exercise of general jurisdiction over them in Texas. Defendants also argue that RDC and the Reddochs are not subject to specific jurisdiction because none of the alleged improper conduct was committed in or directed toward Texas and Plaintiffs seek to recover alleged payments DCDC failed to make, not RDC or the Reddochs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that RDC and the Reddochs are subject to specific jurisdiction. Plaintiffs point out that Reddoch, Jr. admits that he controls all business decisions and employment policies for DCDC, and he and Reddoch, Sr. are the main investors and managers of DCDC. Docket no. 22 at 14. Both individual Defendants control employment decisions, including pay, locations worked, and schedules. At the status conference, Defendants agreed that this Court has specific jurisdiction over Reddoch, Sr. and Reddoch, Jr., as well as over DCDC. Thus, the Court finds it has personal jurisdiction over DCDC, Jeffrey Reddoch, Sr., and Jeffrey Reddoch, Jr.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   At this stage, however, as discussed in open court, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate that Defendant RDC and individual Defendants Chiquita Reddoch, Allison Reddoch Reaux, Leah M. Reddoch O'Meara, Jeremiah M. Reddoch, and Sean M. Reddoch are subject to personal jurisdiction. Plaintiffs do not sufficiently allege that these Defendants carried out roles and responsibilities similar to Reddoch, Sr. and Reddoch, Jr. to indicate that Plaintiffs state claims against them arising out of their sufficient contacts with the state of Texas. Plaintiffs also do not sufficiently allege sufficient contacts as to RDC. Further, the Court finds that these Defendants did not waive personal jurisdiction because they properly asserted and preserved their objection to personal jurisdiction when also moving for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Thus, the Court dismisses Defendant RDC and individual Defendants Chiquita Reddoch, Allison Reddoch Reaux, Leah M. Reddoch O'Meara, Jeremiah M. Reddoch, and Sean M. Reddoch from the case, subject to Plaintiffs' re-urging that the Court in fact has jurisdiction over them following further discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

Application\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Defendants argue that this case should be dismissed for improper venue or, in the alternative, that the case should be transferred to the Western District of Louisiana. Defendants argue that all Defendants are persons or entities in the States of Louisiana or Kentucky, and thus, venue is improper under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201931\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1931\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1). Defendants further argue that no allegations against them are alleged to have occurred within the State of Texas, and thus, venue is improper under \u00a7 1931(b)(2). Defendants argue that the Western District of Louisiana is a more convenient forum for this action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Plaintiffs, on the other hand, argue that venue is proper in the Western District of Texas. Plaintiffs point out that courts have previously ruled that venue is proper in this District, and not in the Western District of Louisiana, for Plaintiffs' claims against DCDC. Also, the arbitration efforts, which ultimately fell through, took place in this District. Plaintiffs further argue venue is proper under \u00a7 1931(b)(2) because they were employed in this District, and thus, a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to their claims occurred in this District.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Defendants concede that venue is proper as to DCDC. Given that the Court has found, and Defendants concede, that the Court has personal jurisdiction over Jeffrey Reddoch, Sr., and Jeffrey Reddoch, Jr., and based on Plaintiffs' claims about their employment that allegedly occurred in this District, the Court finds that venue is proper as to Jeffrey Reddoch, Sr., and Jeffrey Reddoch, Jr. as well. The Court has, at this time, dismissed the remaining individual Defendants and RDC, so it need not determine if venue is proper as to them at this stage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Plaintiffs' Motion for Discovery\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Plaintiffs ask the Court to allow for jurisdictional discovery on Defendants to determine if they are in fact subject to personal jurisdiction. As discussed above, the Court finds that at this point Plaintiffs have failed to show that RDC and individual Defendants Chiquita Reddoch, Allison Reddoch Reaux, Leah M. Reddoch O'Meara, Jeremiah M. Reddoch, and Sean M. Reddoch are subject to personal jurisdiction. But as discussed in open court, the Court dismisses these individual Defendants subject to Plaintiffs re-urging that these Defendants are in fact subject to personal jurisdiction in this case. Thus, to the extent discussed in open court, the\n   Court grants Plaintiffs' motion for jurisdictional discovery to determine what roles and responsibilities these individual Defendants and RDC had with regard to Plaintiffs' claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court DENIES Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment (Docket no. 17), GRANTS IN PART AND DENIES IN PART Defendants' Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Jurisdiction and Improper Venue (Docket no. 18), and GRANTS Plaintiffs' Motion for Discovery (Docket no. 23). Defendant RDC and individual Defendants Chiquita Reddoch, Allison Reddoch Reaux, Leah M. Reddoch O'Meara, Jeremiah M. Reddoch, and Sean M. Reddoch are hereby DISMISSED for lack of personal jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   It is so ORDERED.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
