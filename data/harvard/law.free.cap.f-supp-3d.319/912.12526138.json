Jan. 5, 2016), the court rejected a facial attack to Section 922(g)(3) where defendant argued (as here) that the statute failed to describe how frequently the person must use drugs and whether such use must be proximate to his possession of a firearm, and where (also like here) the defendant argued that because \"the statute does not indicate when a person ceases to be a 'user' it is impossible to know when, if ever, a person who once took drugs is allowed to possess a firearm.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In finding dismissal inappropriate, the Court recognizes Kimbrough's argument in his reply brief that he is making a facial challenge to the statute, and that Sixth Circuit law limiting challenges outside the First Amendment context to \"as applied\" challenges (\n   <em>\n    see e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States v.
