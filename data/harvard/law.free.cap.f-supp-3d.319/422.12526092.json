Plaintiff Emma Sandberg opposes this motion. Although the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (\"D.C. Circuit\") has not expressly adopted a test for evaluating such a request, courts in this\n   Circuit have often applied a five-factor test in cases involving plaintiffs' motions to proceed under pseudonyms. The Court finds no reason not to apply this test to such a motion by Defendant, who nevertheless is unable to prevail. Upon consideration of the pleadings,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   the relevant legal authorities, and the record as a whole, in an exercise of the Court's discretion, the Court shall\n   <strong>\n    DENY\n   </strong>\n   Defendant's [6] Motion to Proceed Under Pseudonym.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

During the summer of 2017, Plaintiff, then a seventeen-year-old rising high school senior, worked as an intern in the District of Columbia. Compl., ECF No. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 6, 12. Defendant, then a rising college sophomore, also lived in the District at the time.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10. On July 22, 2017, Plaintiff met Defendant, who had been invited to Plaintiff's apartment by her roommates.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 11, 14. At the end of an evening of drinking games with other guests, Defendant allegedly pressured Plaintiff to drink further alcohol and allegedly carried her to a bedroom in her apartment, where he allegedly engaged in sexual intercourse with her without her consent.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 11, 13, 15, 17, 24-31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On Plaintiff's behalf, her father brought this action against Defendant, seeking damages for allegations of 1) sexual assault and battery, and 2) negligence and gross negligence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 33-41.

Defendant's Privacy Interest\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   As to the first\n   <em>\n    James\n   </em>\n   factor, Defendant urges that a pseudonym is warranted based on the \"extraordinarily private and sensitive nature\" of the allegations, for they involve the \"private sexual lives\" of the parties. Def.'s Mot. at 1, 4. At least historically, courts have found that \"[m]atters of a sensitive and highly personal nature include those dealing with birth control, abortion, homosexuality or the welfare rights of illegitimate children or abandoned families.\"\n   <em>\n    Chao\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3220374\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/587/90/#p99\">\n    587 F.Supp.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   99 n.8 (citing\n   <em>\n    Wynne &amp; Jaffe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"489297\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/599/707/#p713\">\n    599 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   712-13 ). Courts in this Circuit have split\n   regarding whether plaintiff-victims, as opposed to defendants, in alleged sexual assault cases satisfy this factor.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bernabei &amp; Wachtel PLLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4292527\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/85/89/#p96\">\n    85 F.Supp.3d at 96-97\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Sexual harassment is not typically considered a matter so highly personal as to warrant proceeding by pseudonym.\"),\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Doe v.

Apr. 30, 2012) (\"The Court agrees with plaintiff that the information about the sexual assault at issue in this case is a matter of a sensitive and highly personal nature in which she seeks to preserve a legitimate privacy interest.\"). But the Court need not decide whether Defendant's, as opposed to Plaintiff-alleged victim's, privacy interest warrants proceeding pseudonymously based purely on the nature of the alleged sexual assault and related claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Notwithstanding the type of allegations, certain facts in this case diminish Defendant's privacy interest in proceeding under pseudonym. First, according to Plaintiff's counsel, the incident report prepared by the District of Columbia Department of Forensic Sciences identifies by name both Plaintiff and Defendant. The Court presumes that this report is accessible. Allowing Defendant to proceed under pseudonym would protect only a weak privacy interest, as anyone seeking to discover Defendant's identity need only locate the incident report for the alleged assault against Plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Second, Defendant's residence in the District of Columbia is only temporary. Defendant's fears that the allegations will be stigmatizing or that he will be publicly labeled a sex offender are unlikely to materialize because he is not a long-term member of the community in which this incident occurred and is being litigated.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot. at 4. Defendant offers no basis for his assertion that the media will draw significant attention to this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 5 (alleging in support of second factor that this case is \"likely to garner national media attention\"). Perhaps that would be more likely if this case involved an alleged sexual assault by one college student against another who is enrolled in the same institution. Absent media attention, it is unlikely that a member of the public would search the Electronic Case Filing system in order to obtain information about this action. Consequently, it is not likely that Defendant will be subject to reputational damage attributable only to his naming in this action. The temporary nature of Defendant's residence in the District of Columbia accordingly weakens any privacy interest he may have, weighing against his need for a pseudonym.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Risk of Retaliatory Mental or Physical Harm to Defendant or Non-Parties\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Defendant has not shown that he will be subject to any plausible risk of retaliatory physical or mental harm should the Court deny his motion. Moreover, the Complaint does not identify any non-parties who may risk such harm. \"Courts generally find a risk of retaliatory harm in cases where the moving party provides evidence that psychological damage or violent threats are anticipated if a party's identity is disclosed.\"\n   <em>\n    J.W. v.

In the Court's view, this factor concerns a protected status that is generally reserved to those who have not attained the age of majority.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Fed. R. Civ. P. 5.2(a) &amp; (a)(3) (providing for redaction in court filings of \"the name of an individual known to be a minor\" to include only \"the minor's initials\").

A young person who has attained legal adulthood may have room to grow in maturity, but still he has surpassed the age at which protected status is typically accorded.

Those courts that find litigation between private parties ought to preclude pseudonyms refer to the \"[b]asic fairness\" of requiring plaintiffs to use their actual names if they are going to drag defendants into lawsuits and thereby cause damage to their reputations simply by virtue of suit.\n   <em>\n    Frank\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10521174\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/951/320/#p323\">\n    951 F.2d at 324\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Wynne &amp; Jaffe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"489297\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/599/707/#p713\">\n    599 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   713 ) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Again, it is Defendant, not Plaintiff, that is moving here for a pseudonym, so the case law does not line up cleanly. However, the Court finds certain principles of the foregoing analysis to be consistent with the fairness and transparency that the D.C. Circuit expects. Just as Plaintiff is proceeding under her own name to vindicate her alleged grievances, evidently unabashed that the litigation\n   may divulge sensitive and personal details of her own, so it would seem fair to require that Defendant do so as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   This intuition is consistent with other courts that have considered the fourth\n   <em>\n    James\n   </em>\n   factor as \"stand[ing] at the intersection of the first and fifth factors ... rather than as a factor warranting independent standing of its own.\"\n   <em>\n    U.S. Dep't of State\n   </em>\n   , No. 15-cv-01971,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%209647660\">\n    2015 WL 9647660\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (citing\n   <em>\n    Teti\n   </em>\n   , No. 15-mc-01380,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%206689862\">\n    2015 WL 6689862\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 ). The first and fifth factors are\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   framed in terms that constrain their application beyond cases involving plaintiff-movants. The intersection of the first and fifth factors accordingly pits the Defendant's privacy interest against an evaluation of fairness to Plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   When the Court approaches the fourth\n   <em>\n    James\n   </em>\n   factor in this way, Defendant again cannot carry his burden. Should Defendant be permitted to proceed pseudonymously, Plaintiff may unfairly be required to bear any criticism that those who bring allegations of sexual assault may attract while Defendant \"would be allowed to hide behind a cloak of anonymity.\"\n   <em>\n    De Amigos, LLC\n   </em>\n   , No. 11-1755,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%2013047579\">\n    2012 WL 13047579\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3. Such reputational damage to Plaintiff would not be at issue if Plaintiff were a governmental entity. Because Plaintiff is a private party with privacy interests of her own, the fourth factor arguably weighs against permitting Defendant to proceed pseudonymously.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Where a movant seeks unsuccessfully to proceed pseudonymously, but nevertheless has reason to anticipate injury to reputation were documents exposed during the course of litigation, a protective order may serve the same goal at an appropriate time in the litigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Teti\n   </em>\n   , No. 1:15-mc-01380,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%206689862\">\n    2015 WL 6689862\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (deeming \"fear of injury [to be] premature\" under fourth factor given opportunity for protective order later in litigation). Both Defendant and Plaintiff, of course, could avail themselves of the protections that such an order-if necessary in this litigation-would bring.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Risk of Unfairness to Plaintiff\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The fifth factor is the only one on which Defendant prevails. It is true, as stated above, that Plaintiff has a reputational interest at stake, but the Court shall not double-count this against Defendant. Indeed, other courts in this Circuit have identified a different consideration as more pertinent to the fifth-factor analysis, namely whether the defendant has disclosed his identity to the plaintiff. Defendant here is already known to Plaintiff. Accordingly, there is little risk of unfairness to Plaintiff because she may adequately move forward with the litigation even if Defendant were pseudonymous.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    U.S. Dep't of State\n   </em>\n   , No. 15-cv-01971,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%209647660\">\n    2015 WL 9647660\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (observing that opposing party was \"fully apprised of all relevant information related to [movant]\");\n   <em>\n    De Amigos, LLC\n   </em>\n   , No. 11-1755,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%2013047579\">\n    2012 WL 13047579\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (finding that opposing party would \"not be barred from revealing [movant's] identity during discovery\" to third parties, absent a protective order that movant had not requested).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Although Defendant carries his burden as to the fifth\n   <em>\n    James\n   </em>\n   factor, the Court finds that he has not done so as to the other four and accordingly is not entitled to the \" 'rare dispensation' of anonymity against the world.\"\n   <em>\n    Microsoft Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11343155,3620246\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/56/1448/\">\n    56 F.3d at 1464\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    James\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10508107\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/6/233/#p238\">\n    6 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   238 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
