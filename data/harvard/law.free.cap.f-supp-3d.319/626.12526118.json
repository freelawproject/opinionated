(\"Plaintiff\") commenced this action on October 4, 2017, alleging that Defendants Delves &amp; Giufre Enterprises, Inc., d/b/a Never-Wet Basement Waterproofing (\"Never-Wet\"), Neil Delves (\"Delves\"), and Kevin Giufre (\"Giufre\") (collectively \"Defendants\") have infringed certain claims of United States Patent No. 6,634,144 (the \"'144 Patent\"), entitled \"Home Waterproofing System\" and issued on October 23, 2003. (Dkt. 1 at \u00b6 15). According to Plaintiff, Defendants infringed the '144 Patent by \"making, using, offering for sale, selling, and/or importing into the United States ... home waterproofing systems [that] meet[ ] each and every element in at least claim 1\" thereof. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendants deny infringing the '144 Patent and, on November 7, 2017, filed a motion to dismiss Plaintiff's Complaint\n   pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim. (Dkt. 10). That same day, Plaintiff filed, as of right, an Amended Complaint. (Dkt. 12). On November 20, 2017, Defendants filed a second motion seeking dismissal of the Amended Complaint. (Dkt. 13). For the reasons set forth below, Defendants' motions to dismiss (Dkt. 10; Dkt. 13) are denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The following facts are taken from the Amended Complaint, the operative pleading in this matter. As required on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, the Court treats these facts as true.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff is a \"leading franchisor in the basement waterproofing business,\" providing homeowners with waterproofing systems that prevent water damage and protect a home's foundation. (Dkt. 12 at \u00b6 9). Plaintiff owns the '144 Patent, which issued on October 21, 2003, and describes \"[a] waterproof system for draining water away from a building located in ground having a surface above which a portion of the building extends.\" (Dkt. 12-1 at 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Delves and Giufre are former employees of Everdry Waterproofing of Upstate New York (\"Everdry Upstate\"), Plaintiff's franchisee in the Rochester, New York area. (Dkt. 12 at \u00b6 10). While employed by Everdry Upstate, Delves and Giufre were trained to install Plaintiff's waterproofing systems. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Delves and Giufre subsequently voluntarily resigned from Everdry Upstate and formed Never-Wet, which directly competes with Plaintiff in the basement waterproofing industry. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On July 17, 2014, Plaintiff's counsel sent a letter to Delves warning him to refrain from unauthorized use of Plaintiffs patented technology. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 12-13). Notwithstanding this warning, Delves and Giufre, through Never-Wet, have installed one or more waterproofing systems using Plaintiff's patented technology. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13). Specifically, Defendants have installed waterproofing systems that meet each and every element of at least claim 1 of the '144 Patent. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Claim 1 of the '144 Patent claims \"[a] waterproofing system for draining water away from a building located in ground having a surface above which a portion of the building extends the building having a footer and at least one wall extending vertically from said footer....\" (Dkt. 12-1 at 10). The claimed system comprises:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   a first drain member located in a first trench provided in the ground outside the building, said first drain member extending adjacent at least a portion of said at least one wall; and a membrane comprised of a first portion secured to a second portion, said first portion and second portion having different thicknesses, said first portion forming a liner which lines at least a portion of said first trench to form a trough for capturing water flowing from the ground surface into said trench and for preventing water from flowing downwardly along said wall, said second portion being positioned adjacent an outer surface of said at least one wall along at least a portion of a height of said wall and extending toward said footer.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that the waterproofing system sold by Never-Wet meets each and every element of claim 1 of the '144 Patent, and that Defendants have therefore infringed the patent. Specifically, Plaintiff alleges that Never-Wet's waterproofing systems include a trench and drain tile installed outside of a home and extending along the basement wall. (Dkt. 12 at \u00b6 17). Plaintiff further alleges that Never-Wet's waterproofing system uses a membrane\n   comprised of two portions (with the first portion being waterproofing tar and the second portion being heavy duty plastic), that the two portions have different thicknesses, and that the first portion (the waterproofing tar) lines at least a portion of the first trench to form a trough for capturing water flowing from the ground surface into the trench and for preventing water from flowing downwardly along the wall. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ), Based on Delves and Giufre's former employment by Everdry Upstate and knowledge of the '144 Patent, Plaintiff contends that their infringement was willful. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 20).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

In particular, Defendants argue as follows: (1) the layer of waterproofing tar they use as an adhesive to attach heavy duty plastic to the foundation wall is not a \"membrane\" as that term is used in claim 1 of the '144 Patent ; and (2) even if the layer of waterproofing tar is considered a \"membrane,\" it does not \"form a trough for capturing water flowing from the ground surface into the trench and preventing water from flowing downwardly along the wall.\" (Dkt. 13-1 at 5-11). For the reasons discussed below, the Court finds that Defendants' motion to dismiss asks the Court to construe contested claim terms and is therefore unsuited for resolution at this point of the proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   The[re] are two elements of a simple patent case, construing the patent and determining whether infringement occurred....

Both of the arguments made by Defendants would require the Court to construe disputed patent terms. First, with respect to Defendants' argument that the waterproofing tar used in their system does not \"form a liner which lines at least a portion of the first trench to form a trough,\" the Court cannot resolve this dispute without construing whether, as Defendants claim, the waterproofing tar must form the entirety of the trough, or if, as Plaintiff argues, it is sufficient that the waterproofing tar (considered alone or in combination with the heavy duty plastic) form a portion of the trough. While Defendants argue that Plaintiff's reading of this element of claim 1 of the '144 Patent is \"tortured\" (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 16 at 6), the Court is not persuaded that it is so unreasonable as to be amenable to rejection on a motion to dismiss. Defendants' argument relies heavily on the drawing sheets included in the '144 Patent. However, it is well-established that \"the mere fact that the patent drawings depict a particular embodiment of the patent does not operate to limit the claims to that specific configuration.\"\n   <em>\n    Prima Tek II, L.L.C. v. Polypap, S.A.R.L.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9342478\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/318/1143/#p1148\">\n    318 F.3d 1143\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1148 (Fed. Cir. 2003). Defendants have not demonstrated that this dispute over the scope of claim 1 of the '144 is so clear that the Court can determine it on a motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Second, Defendants' argument that waterproofing tar cannot constitute a membrane is a quintessential issue of claim construction. As Plaintiff points out, the term membrane is generally defined as a \"thin, flexible layer or material designed to separate, filter, etc.\" (Dkt. 15 at 12 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Collins English Dictionary\n   </em>\n   , https://www.collinsdictionary.com/us/dictionary/english/membrane) ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On its face, a layer of waterproofing tar plausibly falls within this definition. While Defendants are free to argue for a different definition of \"membrane\" through the claim construction process, it would be premature for the Court to construe that patent term at this initial stage of the proceedings, with nothing before it but the patent and the Amended Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In sum, resolution of Defendants' claim construction arguments (which are integral\n   to their motion to dismiss) would be inappropriate at this stage of the proceedings, because the record is not adequately developed. Accordingly, the Court denies Defendants' motion to dismiss the Amended Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, Defendants' motions to dismiss (Dkt. 10; Dkt. 13) are denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    Defendants contend that it is not proper to refer to a dictionary on a motion to dismiss.
