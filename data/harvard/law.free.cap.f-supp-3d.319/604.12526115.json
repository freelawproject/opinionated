ECF No. 4. For the following reasons, the motion is GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   DHLNH alleges that the Defendants-International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Local 251 and numerous named and unnamed individuals-have engaged in unlawful picketing activities outside of DHLNH's Pawtucket, Rhode Island facility. On the morning of May 25, 2018, DHLNH filed a verified complaint and a motion for a temporary restraining order in Rhode Island Superior Court. The superior court scheduled a TRO hearing for 2:00 pm on that day. By noon, however, the Defendants had removed the matter to this Court. No Defendant had been served by the time the action was removed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On the morning of the next business day, DHLNH filed an emergency motion to remand the case to state court. The Defendants responded and a hearing was held that morning, following which the Court ordered supplemental briefing on an expedited basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201441\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) allows for \"any civil action brought in a State court of which the district courts of the United States have original jurisdiction\" to be \"removed by the defendant or the defendants\" to the appropriate United States district court. Whether this case can be removed, then, depends on whether this Court has original jurisdiction, either by diversity jurisdiction or federal question jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Diversity Jurisdiction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Defendants assert that they removed this case on the basis of diversity jurisdiction. ECF No. 1 at 1. While it does appear that there is diversity of citizenship (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1-1 \u00b6 1; ECF No. 10 at 3; ECF No. 11 at 6), removal in this case is barred by the forum defendant rule. That rule, codified at\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201441\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2), provides that \"[a] civil action otherwise removable solely on the basis of [diversity jurisdiction] may not be removed if any of the parties in interest properly joined and served as defendants is a citizen of the State in which such action is brought.\" The Defendants argue that this rule cannot apply to them because none of them was \"properly joined and served\" prior to removal. The Court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   As both parties note, federal courts are divided as to whether the forum defendant rule bars removal before service on the basis of diversity jurisdiction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, \"the growing trend among district courts wrestling with this issue is to remand, finding that although 'the plain meaning of [\u00a7] 1441(b)(2) permits pre-service removal by a resident defendant, ... a literal application of this plain meaning is contrary to congressional intent and creates absurd results.' \"\n   <em>\n    Deutsche Bank Nat'l Tr.
