For the reasons identified below, defendants' motion to dismiss (DE # 6) will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff Dale Pierson (\"Pierson\"), General Counsel to Local 150 of the International Union of Operating Engineers, AFL-CIO (\"the Union\"), filed the present defamation claim against defendant National Institute for Labor Relations Research (\"NILRR\") and defendant Stan Greer (\"Greer\"), a senior research associate for NILRR. (DE # 1.) NILRR identifies itself as a \"non-profit research facility analyzing and exposing the inequities of compulsory unionism.\" (DE # 7 at 2.) NILRR maintains a website, on which it publishes articles in furtherance of this stated purpose. (DE # 1 at 2.) Pierson's complaint alleges that statements made in an article authored by Greer and published by NILRR constituted defamation\n   <em>\n    per se.\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The State of Indiana's passage of \"Right-to-Work\" legislation in 2012 is at the center of the parties' present dispute. The passage of this law spurred litigation from union-plaintiffs, who argued that the law was fundamentally unfair because it allowed non-member employees to unfairly benefit from the union's representation without paying for their share of that representation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.) Proponents of the legislation, however, argued that unions are not obliged to represent non-member employees. They argued that a union voluntarily assumes the obligation to represent all employees once it obtains majority status-but that it could, in the alternative, choose to represent only those employees who wanted union representation and membership-i.e. \"minority representation\" or \"members-only representation.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) It is this disagreement which gives rise to the present litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Pierson argued that minority representation is a legal fallacy during his oral argument before the Supreme Court of\n   Indiana in\n   <em>\n    Zoeller v. Sweeney\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6904459\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/19/749/#p750\">\n    19 N.E.3d 749\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 750 (Ind. 2014). Pierson, on behalf of the Union, argued that such representation is impossible because (i) the National Labor Relations Board would not process a representation petition by a union that sought to create a \"members-only\" or \"minority\" bargaining unit; and (ii) a union that purported to represent only a minority of the bargaining unit would have no recourse if the employer refused to bargain with it.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6904459\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/19/749/#p750\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   For example, during oral argument Pierson had the following exchange with the Justices of the Supreme Court of Indiana:\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   JUSTICE MASSA: Isn't it the union's choice to seek exclusive representation of all the workers?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   MR. PIERSON: It is the union's choice and mission to seek representation of workers generally, yes, your Honor, but to the extent that the State suggests that it's a choice between seeking exclusive representation and minority or members-only units, that is a fallacy, there is no choice there, because there is no such thing as a members-only union, not under the Federal scheme. The structure of the Labor Act, consistent case law, the Labor Board's determinations, that system just does not exist.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   JUSTICE RUCKER: I'd like to take that a little further because that seems to be synonymous, the debate between your side and the State side. The State says, yes, there can be members only, you say no, there cannot be members only. How crucial is it that there can or cannot be, to your constitution-your facial constitutional challenge?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   MR. PIERSON: Well, it's one of the only ways that the State can avoid the Federal-the existence of the Federal obligation to represent all members of a bargaining unit fairly and then the Right-to-Work law allowing some people-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   JUSTICE RUCKER: I guess my point is-I guess my point is, is it a difference between it makes the union-it makes it more difficult for the union because the employee does not have to-does not have to negotiate with the members only and is not protected by the National Labor Relations Act, but does that prevent-it makes it more difficult, but the question is does it prevent the unions from representing a members only-having a members-only representation?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   MR. PIERSON: Yes, your Honor, the law does not allow members-only\n   representation, that's the bottom line, that is not an option.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   (DE # 7-1 at 7-8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Indiana Supreme Court ultimately rejected this argument. \"The Union's federal obligation to represent all employees in a bargaining unit is optional; it occurs only when the union elects to be the exclusive bargaining agent, for which it is justly compensated by the right to bargain exclusively with the employer.\"\n   <em>\n    Zoeller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6904459\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/19/749/#p750\">\n    19 N.E.3d at 753\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   After Pierson's oral argument, Greer wrote, and NILRR published, an online article characterizing Pierson's argument. The article stated the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Operating Engineers Union Lawyer Flat-Out Lies to Indiana Supreme Court\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   Currently, the top bosses of two unions, the United Steelworkers (USW) and Local 150 of the International Union of Operating Engineers (IUOE), have cases before the Indiana Supreme Court in which they are trying to get Right to Work protections for Hoosier employees approved by state legislators two-and-a-half years ago judicially overturned.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   In a petition filed with the National Labor Relations Board seven years ago, lawyers for one of these two unions, the USW, acknowledged without qualification that, under Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), in any workplace where no union is recognized as employees' \"exclusive\" bargaining agent, employees' right to bargain with their employer through a union \"remain[s] available and protected, though on a nonexclusive basis, thus applicable to union members only.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   As anyone who has a good understanding of federal labor statutes and court precedents knows, the union lawyers for the USW brass, along with the officers of six other AFL-CIO-affiliated unions who signed on to the petition (\"In the Matter of Rulemaking Regarding Members-Only Minority-Union Collective Bargaining\"), were absolutely correct about the permissibility of members-only bargaining in 2007. And they are still correct today.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   How can it be, then, that Dale Pierson, the top lawyer for the other union seeking to overturn Indiana's Right to Work law judicially, told the Indiana Supreme Court on September 4 that union officials' representing only those who join and pay dues \"is not a legal possibility\"? (A video of the oral arguments in which Pierson claimed again and again that \"the law does not allow members-only representation\" is available at the end of the link below.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   The answer is, quite simply, that Pierson flat-out lied. Evidently, he and the other IUOE bosses for whom he is working agree that, if the Indiana Supreme Court acknowledges the truth about the permissibility of members-only bargaining as an alternative to monopoly bargaining for union officials, their anti-Right to Work case must fail. And therefore last week Pierson simply denied a truth that even his fellow assailants on Indiana's Right to Work law, the USW union hierarchy, have openly acknowledged in public legal documents.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   Because Thomas Fisher, the lead attorney representing Indiana as it defends its Right to Work law from the IUOE Local 150 brass, knows full well about the U.S. Supreme Court precedents, such as the 1938 Consolidated Edison v. NLRB ruling, that explicitly affirm that members-only bargaining is legal under the NLRA, and reminded the Indiana Supreme Court justices about them, it is unlikely that Pierson and his paymasters are going to get away with lying about federal labor law. But the fact that Pierson\n   was willing to do it, and IUOE Local 150 kingpins were evidently willing to sign off on such a strategy, illustrates just how desperate they are to reinstate forced union dues and fees in Indiana.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   (DE # 7-2 at 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Pierson subsequently filed the present lawsuit, alleging that the statements in the article constitute defamation\n   <em>\n    per se.\n   </em>\n   (DE # 1.) According to Pierson, defendants made and published these statements knowing them to be false. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Defendants now move to dismiss Pierson's complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim. (DE # 6.) Defendants argue: (i) the statements were not defamatory\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   ; (ii) the statements in the article were substantially true, and are therefore not defamatory; (iii) the statements were opinion or rhetorical hyperbole, and are therefore not defamatory; (iv) Pierson failed to plead special damages; (v) Pierson failed to plead actual malice; (vi) the statements were protected by the qualified common interest privilege; and (vii) Pierson's complaint violates Indiana's Anti-SLAPP statute.

Rather, the union leader's remarks only acquired a defamatory meaning when considered in the context of the union leader's pattern of personal attacks against the principal.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"494694\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/968/1330/#p1334\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <em>\n    Levee\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable. Contrary to defendants' assertions,\n   <em>\n    Levee\n   </em>\n   did not hold that calling someone a \"liar\" never amounts to defamation\n   <em>\n    per se.\n   </em>\n   Rather, the court held that, in the specific case before it, the remarks were only defamatory when considered in context. The same is not true in this case. Here, defendants' article accused Pierson of intentionally lying to the Indiana Supreme Court. The defamatory nature of defendants' statements can be assessed on the face of the statements, without any additional context or information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Moreover, unlike in\n   <em>\n    Levee\n   </em>\n   , defendants' accusations that Pierson \"flat-out lied\" to the Indiana Supreme Court clearly charge Pierson of professional misconduct. Chief among a lawyer's duties is his or her duty of candor to the Courts. Defendants' article impugns Pierson's professional reputation by accusing him of violating his ethical obligations as an officer of the court. As the Seventh Circuit has noted, \"sometimes personal integrity is so intertwined with job skills, that an attack upon it could constitute defamation\n   <em>\n    per se.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Madison v.

Thus, Pierson's complaint sufficiently alleges defamation\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   and defendants' motion to dismiss on this ground is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <em>\n    B. Substantial Truth\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Defendants assert that Pierson's complaint fails to state a claim because the statements in the article were substantially true. Substantial truth can be a defense to defamation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Haynes v. Alfred A. Knopf, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10515316\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/8/1222/#p1227\">\n    8 F.3d 1222\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1227 (7th Cir. 1993) (\"[I]f the gist of a defamatory statement is true, if in other words the statement is substantially true, error in detail is not actionable.\");\n   <em>\n    Heeb v. Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10837291,10837316\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/613/416/\">\n    613 N.E.2d 416\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 421 (Ind. Ct. App. 1993) (\"Under the Constitution, literal truth is not required; it is sufficient if the statement is substantially true.\"). Here, however, defendants do not actually make a substantive argument that their assertions that Pierson lied to the Indiana Supreme Court were substantially true. Rather, after a one-sentence conclusory statement, they turned their focus to two unrelated propositions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   First, defendants attempt to create distance between the accusations in their article and Pierson individually. Defendants argue that the statements in the article were not\n   <em>\n    really\n   </em>\n   about Pierson, but were instead directed at \"pointing out an inconsistent position that has been maintained by Unions in their various advocacy efforts.\" (DE # 7 at 7.) They claim that their accusation that Pierson lied merely \"highlighted\n   the irritation Greer felt at the blatantly contradictory positions maintained by the Unions.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9.) \"[T]he 'lies' or 'untruth' comments are not directed at plaintiff the individual, but rather at the legal 'strategy' of those who benefit from the position....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Defendants' intent aside, the article expressly accused Pierson, by name, of lying to the Indiana Supreme Court. Whether defendants intended to accuse Pierson, individually, of lying to the Indiana Supreme Court, or whether they intended to accuse Pierson of lying as part of a legal strategy on behalf of his union client, the question remains whether it is substantially true that Pierson lied at all. Defendants leave this question unanswered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Second, defendants argue that Pierson \"cannot deny that legal precedent does not bolster the position he took during the oral hearing. Indeed, even the Indiana Supreme Court expressly questioned and disagreed with plaintiff's statement made at oral argument regarding the legal impossibility. Further, case law calls into question plaintiff's statements made to the Indiana Supreme Court.\" (DE # 7 at 8-9 (internal citation to\n   <em>\n    Zoeller\n   </em>\n   omitted).) Defendants do not, however, actually cite to such case law. Moreover, the fact that the Indiana Supreme Court subsequently rejected Pierson's position in its written decision is not evidence that Pierson lied when he made the statements during oral argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Defendants have failed to identify any legal support for their position that Pierson lied when he told the Indiana Supreme Court that members-only unions are a legal impossibility. Therefore, their motion to dismiss based on the substantial truth of their statements is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <em>\n    C. Rhetorical Hyperbole and Opinion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Defendants argue that Pierson's complaint fails to state a claim because the statements were constitutionally protected opinion and/or rhetorical hyperbole.

The fact that both parties are concerned with legislation regulating unions is not sufficient to grant privilege to whatever they choose say regarding the subject, as defendants suggest.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McCollough\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12144178,12357746\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/63/334/\">\n    63 N.E.3d at 338-49\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (common interest privilege did not apply to school district's press release regarding aggressive incident between school's basketball coach and a student because there was no corresponding interest or duty between school district and general public).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Defendants also do not have the type of duty that would give rise to the qualified privilege.

CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   For these reasons, the court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   defendants' motion to dismiss (DE # 6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <strong>\n    SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    While neither party addressed this issue, the court notes that it may properly consider the exhibits attached to defendants' motion-the transcript of the oral argument, the copy of defendants' article, and the 2007 Petition-without automatically converting the motion to a motion for summary judgment pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(d). Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 10(c) provides that \"[a] statement in a pleading may be adopted by reference elsewhere in the same pleading or in any other pleading or motion. A copy of a written instrument that is an exhibit to a pleading is a part of the pleading for all purposes.\" Courts have construed Rule 10(c) to extend to consideration of documents referenced, but not attached, to the complaint.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Venture Associates Corp. v.

Documents that a defendant attaches to a motion to dismiss are considered part of the pleadings if they are referred to in the plaintiff's complaint and are central to her claim.\") (internal citations omitted). Here, the exhibits to defendants' motion were referenced in, and are central to, the complaint, and thus the exhibits may properly be considered in resolving the pending motion.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
