R. 23, 8/23/16 Opinion at 7-13. Sterlinski then filed an Amended Complaint, asserting all of the same claims, but this time alleging how the demotion affected his job duties as the church's Director of Music. R. 24, Am. Compl. (Count 1 \u00b6 13). That is the only substantive difference between the original complaint and the amended one. The Catholic Bishop moved to dismiss the Amended Complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), arguing that the ministerial exception still barred the claims. R. 26, Mot. to Dismiss Am. Compl. The Court granted the Catholic Bishop's motion as it pertained to Sterlinski's claims arising from the\n   <em>\n    demotion\n   </em>\n   , but denied it as it pertained to his\n   <em>\n    firing\n   </em>\n   .

Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Catholic Bishop hired Sterlinski in July 1992 to serve as the Director of Music at St. Stanislaus Bishop and Martyr Parish.

As a result of the demotion, Sterlinski's duties as Director of Music were taken away: he no longer participated in the budget process; he was not sent to Archdiocesan Music Committee activities; his access to the church became limited; he became responsible for maintaining his own music skills; he no longer taught music to the children at Polish School; and he no longer held practices for the church choirs.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20621\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20621\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 13, 30\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . After the demotion, Sterlinski performed only the duties of organist at church functions.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20621\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20621\">\n    \u00b6 25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; DSOF \u00b6 6.

The parties disagree on whether Sterlinski's job title changed from Director of Music to Organist after his\n   demotion. R. 57, Pl.'s Resp. DSOF \u00b6 5. But neither party disputes that Sterlinski was not formally ordained. R. 59, Def.'s Resp. PSOF \u00b6 20. Sometime after the demotion,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Sterlinski was fired. PSOF \u00b6 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   At this stage of the case, the key dispute is the importance of music-and, more specifically, the importance of instrumentalists-to Catholic Worship at Mass. In support of its contention that music serves a ministerial function during Mass, the Catholic Bishop relies on two sources: (1) the expert affidavit of D. Todd Williamson, the Director of the Office for Divine Worship, Archdiocese of Chicago; and (2) a document issued by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, entitled\n   <em>\n    Sing to the Lord, Music in Divine Worship\n   </em>\n   , which provides guidance and direction in all matters of Liturgical Music. DSOF \u00b6\u00b6 10-28. The Catholic Bishop argues that music and singing are integral elements of Catholic Worship, and that when music is played and sung at Mass, it becomes \"sung prayer,\" that is, \"prayer that is supported and directed by instrumental music being played.\" DSOF \u00b6 14. According to the Catholic Bishop, all musicians at Mass-including the organist-\"exercise a genuine liturgical ministry\" by leading and sustaining the assembly's sung prayer.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20621\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20621\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 21-22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Of the instruments used during Mass, \"the organ is accorded pride of place.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20621\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20621\">\n    \u00b6 26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Against this, Sterlinski asserts that instrumental music, including organ music, is not necessary to a Catholic Mass or Worship. Pl.'s Resp. DSOF \u00b6\u00b6 13-14, 16, 21-28; PSOF \u00b6\u00b6 18, 34. As an organist with no discretion in what music was played or how he played it, Sterlinski contends that his role was neither necessary nor ministerial-and in fact could be replaced with recorded music.

But it is broken logic to then infer, from that premise, that when music\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   played live, the musician plays no ministerial function.

There are, however, a couple of other factors to weigh. Starting with Sterlinski's official title, there appears to be a genuine issue of fact as to his title after his demotion. The Catholic Bishop argues that Sterlinski retained his title of Director of Music, as evidenced by the job description. Def.'s Mot. Summ. J. at 2, 9; DSOF \u00b6 5; R. 43-1, Position Description (listing Sterlinski's part-time position as that of \"Music Director\").

C, Church Bulletin (listing Sterlinski as the \"Organist\"). But even accepting Sterlinski's version, the title \"Organist\" still points to a ministerial role under official Church doctrine, as taught by\n   <em>\n    Sing to the Lord\n   </em>\n   and as proven by Williamson's expert opinion.

Sterlinski concedes that he played the organ and accompanied the Parish choir at weekend Mass, and played the organ at Parish weddings and funerals, and did so at the direction of Father Dzioerk. Pl.'s Resp. DSOF \u00b6\u00b6 6, 8. And Sterlinski agrees he was listed as the Parish organist on the Church's bulletin.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9. Sterlinski's presence and musical performance at Mass alone, under the direction of Father Dziorek, demonstrated to the congregation that he, as the organist, was a messenger of the Catholic faith and a musical minister of the liturgical prayer.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   DSOF \u00b6\u00b6 13, 20-23 (citing Williamson Report at 2-4;\n   <em>\n    Sing to the Lord\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 49-50, 95).
