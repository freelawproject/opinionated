(\"eBay\") and individual eBay seller Jack Ly (\"Mr. Ly\")(also known as David Kennedy). Mr. Daniel brings several claims against both defendants, including \"breach of contract, fraud, collusion, conspiracy, failure to monitor business and its agents, failure to supervise business and its sellers, agency, unjust enrichment, redhibition, theft by deception, theft by conversion, unfair and\n   deceptive trade practices, and violations of [unspecified] laws, statutes, and/or regulations designed for the safety of consumers.\" Compl., ECF No. 1 \u00b6 13. Mr. Daniel's claims all arise from his purchase of an allegedly counterfeit watch from Mr. Ly through eBay's online marketplace. Arguing that Mr. Daniel had agreed to submit to arbitration, eBay filed a motion to compel arbitration and stay this litigation.

To briefly summarize, Mr. Daniel bought what he thought was an \"authentic\" Audemars Piguet Royal Offshore Watch from Mr. Ly, a registered eBay seller, via eBay's online marketplace on July 9, 2015. Compl., ECF No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 4-6, 8. The watch was allegedly worth $75,000.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On July 14, 2015, Mr. Daniel learned that the watch was counterfeit, not \"authentic\" as marketed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 7, 8.

This version of the User Agreement was in effect when Mr. Daniel purchased the counterfeit watch in July 2015. Long Decl., ECF No. 6-2 \u00b6 18. The 2015 User Agreement contained an arbitration provision practically identical to the 2012 version:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   [The user] and eBay each agree that any and all disputes or claims that have arisen or may arise between [the user] and eBay relating in any way to or arising out of this or previous versions of the User Agreement, [the user's] use of or access to eBay's Services shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than in court ....

Indeed, in eBay's preferred forum claims of \"general\" notice without evidence of \"personal[ ]\" and \"actual\" mailing to affected customers was insufficient to demonstrate consent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McCoy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11114906\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/20/901/\">\n    20 P.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   905 \u00b6 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Next, eBay asserts that it sent the 2012 User Agreement to Mr. Daniel \"through his My eBay Message Center.\" Def.'s Mot. to Arb., ECF No. 9 at 3 (citing Long Decl., ECF No. 6-2 \u00b6 18);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Reply, ECF No. 14 at 2 (citing Long.

Again, the record does not support this assertion. Not only is there no paragraph 20 in the Long Declaration, but the email attached as an exhibit to the Declaration was not addressed to Mr. Daniel.
