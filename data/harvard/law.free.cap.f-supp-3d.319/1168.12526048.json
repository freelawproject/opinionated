Bureau of Reclamation\n   </em>\n   , No. 16-cv-4294, and\n   <em>\n    Yurok Tribe v. Bureau of Reclamation\n   </em>\n   , No. 16-cv-6863.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hoopa Dkt. No. 111; Yurok Dkt. No. 70. The injunctions ordered the United States Bureau of Reclamation (the \"Bureau\") to require certain types of water flows as part of their operation of the Klamath River Project in order to prevent irreparable harm to the SONCC Coho salmon, an endangered species. The plaintiffs in those two cases are two federally protected Klamath Basin Tribes, the Hoopa Valley Tribe and the Yurok Tribe, whose cultural heritage and economic wellbeing revolve around the salmon's health, as well as the Pacific Coast Federation of Fishermen's Associations, Institute for Fisheries Resources, and Klamath Riverkeeper. Certain organizations and persons interested in the Klamath River Project, namely, the Klamath Water Users Association, Sunnyside Irrigation District, Ben DuVal, Klamath Drainage District, Klamath Irrigation District, and Pine Grove Irrigation District (together, \"intervenors\") intervened in both cases on the side of the Bureau and the National Marine Fisheries Service (\"NMFS,\" and together with the Bureau, \"federal defendants\"), advocating the interests of ranchers and farmers in receiving needed water for their livelihoods. While all of the parties present important equitable concerns, I issued the injunctions because the law demands that endangered species are entitled to primary protection. Both federal defendants and intervenors filed timely notices of appeal in the two cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Water year 2017 resulted in favorable conditions in the Klamath River, while water year 2018 has been significantly drier. On March 7, 2018, intervenors moved for relief from the judgment, or, in the alternative, a stay of enforcement of the injunctions, arguing that the application of the injunctions to water year 2018 is both unnecessary and inequitable due to new information not available at the time that the\n   injunctions were issued. Federal defendants do not join in intervenors' motion, but respond separately that they believe that full compliance with the injunctions is not possible as a result of the drier hydrological conditions, and propose a new plan. Plaintiffs oppose both intervenors' motion and federal defendants' proposal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Given the pendency of the appeal, my jurisdiction is limited. Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 62.1, I consider the merits of intervenors' motion and DENY it because they do not show newly discovered evidence sufficient to justify suspending or modifying the injunctions pursuant to Rule 60(b)(2), nor that prospective application of the injunctions would be inequitable pursuant to Rule 60(b)(5). Staying enforcement would not preserve the status quo, and I do not have jurisdiction to grant their requested stay while the appeal is pending. Nor would I in light of the evidence of record. With respect to federal defendants' proposed plan, I clarify federal defendants' obligations under the injunctions-partial compliance with Measure 4 is necessary in the event that full compliance is not possible. And I again urge that the able scientists who are working on this issue attempt to reach consensus on whether the best available science has changed since issuance of the 2013 Biological Opinion to the extent that the injunctions should be modified prior to water year 2019.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   This proceeding involves the permanent injunctions issued in two related cases,\n   <em>\n    Hoopa Valley Tribe v. Bureau of Reclamation\n   </em>\n   , No. 16-cv-4294 (filed July 29, 2016), and\n   <em>\n    Yurok Tribe v. Bureau of Reclamation\n   </em>\n   , No. 16-cv-6863 (filed November 29, 2016). Plaintiffs in both cases brought suit in 2016 after the Bureau's 2014 and 2015 operation of the Klamath River Project\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   resulted in significant exceedances of\n   <em>\n    C. shasta\n   </em>\n   disease rate standards among Coho salmon, which are listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act (\"ESA\"). These exceedances triggered the federal defendants' obligation to reinitiate formal consultation and prepare a new Biological Opinion for the Klamath River Project; they failed to do so. Intervenors, who are interested in the action due to the effects of the Klamath River Project on the irrigation districts that depend on it for water, intervened on the side of the federal defendants.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hoopa Dkt. Nos. 30, 72; Yurok Dkt. No. 46.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On November 30 and December 1, 2016, plaintiffs in the two cases moved for summary judgment on the failure to reinitiate claims and for permanent injunctions. The permanent injunctions requested implementation of certain guidance measures based on a draft document titled, \"Measures to Reduce\n   <em>\n    Ceratanova shasta\n   </em>\n   Infections of Klamath River Salmonids: A Guidance Document,\" drafted by plaintiffs based on four technical memoranda prepared by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (\"FWS\"). The federal defendants and intervenors opposed on several grounds, including intervenors' argument that an evidentiary hearing was necessary in order to resolve factual disputes on whether injunctive relief was necessary to prevent irreparable harm to the Coho salmon or would cause harm to other endangered species.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   I heard oral argument on January 27, 2017. Because the Bureau needed to make certain irrigation allocation decisions on or around April 1, 2017, and prevention flows might have been needed sooner than that, plaintiffs requested a decision by mid-February 2017. Based on the record, including the draft (and later final) guidance document, I granted summary judgment for plaintiffs on the reinitiation claim and issued the permanent injunctions on February 8, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hoopa Dkt. No. 102; Yurok Dkt. No. 62 (together, \"Injunction Orders\"). I denied intervenors' request for an evidentiary hearing because many of intervenors' arguments were irrelevant to whether an injunction against the Klamath Project was warranted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Injunction Orders at 51. Plaintiffs' requested relief was based on the best available science and, given the threat of imminent harm to the endangered Coho salmon, waiting for \"perfect\" science was not appropriate.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 51-52. The Injunction Orders directed the parties to confer and submit a more detailed proposed order in accordance with the best available science that met the parameters set in the Injunction Orders. Based on that submission, I modified the injunction orders on March 24, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hoopa Dkt. No. 111; Yurok Dkt. No. 70 (together, \"Modified Injunction Orders\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Among other things, the Modified Injunction Orders adopted certain Management Guidance Measures from the final Guidance Document, including Measures 1 and 4. Measure 1 requires the Bureau to release annual winter-spring surface flushing flows, and Measure 4 requires the Bureau to release emergency dilution flows and establish a 50,000 acre foot (\"50 TAF\") reserve water supply to supplement those flows.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Modified Injunction Orders at \u00b6\u00b6 4, 6, 10-12. In recognition that the endangered sucker fish\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   that inhabit the Upper Klamath Lake could be affected by the proceedings, the Modified Injunction Orders specifically tasked the Bureau with managing \"the Klamath Reclamation Project (\"Project\"), including Project deliveries from the upper Klamath Lake (\"UKL\"), in a manner that will not preclude the ability to provide Reserve Water to implement up to 50 TAF of emergency dilution flows and/or interfere with its ability to meet its obligations under the ESA with regard to endangered suckers and/or their critical habitat.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13. Federal defendants and intervenors both filed timely notices of appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The parties agree that while water year 2017 was comparably wet, water year 2018 has been and is expected to be drier. The parties dispute whether there is enough water for the Bureau to fulfill its obligations under the Modified Injunction Orders as well as whether such fulfillment is necessary given the current hydrological conditions. On March 7, 2018, intervenors filed this Motion for Relief from Judgment and/or Stay of Enforcement in both cases.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hoopa Dkt. No. 139; Yurok Dkt. No. 101. Federal defendants have separately filed what they call a response to intervenors' motion, informing the Court of their alternative proposed plan.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hoopa Dkt. No. 145-1; Yurok Dkt. No. 109-1.

Motion for Relief from Judgment Pursuant to Rule 60(b)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Intervenors move for relief from the Modified Injunction Orders on the grounds that there is newly discovered evidence pursuant to Rule 60(b)(2), and that applying the judgment prospectively is no longer equitable pursuant to Rule 60(b)(5). The federal defendants do not join in this motion, and plaintiffs oppose it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    A. \"Newly Discovered Evidence\" Pursuant to Rule 60(b)(2)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The prevalence of infection (\"POI\") rates for the Coho salmon were the triggers for reinitiation underlying the previous Injunction Orders. Intervenors argue that new reports and information from 2017, generated after the issuance of the Injunction Orders, demonstrate that the injunctions are not based on sound science and is unnecessary to protect Coho salmon in 2018. They contend that the best available science now demonstrates that the POI rates underlying the Injunction Orders using the QPCR method were inaccurate,\n   and that a new method of calculation, weighted by abundance, actually reveals that they were far lower than plaintiffs represented-18 and 29 percent, rather than 81 and 91 percent. As a result of intervenors' assertion, I ordered supplemental briefing to address whether intervenors' percentages were calculated consistently with the triggers set by the 2013 Biological Opinion (\"2013 BiOp\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hoopa Dkt. No. 154; Yurok Dkt. No. 123.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In their supplemental briefing, all parties agreed that the 81 and 91 percent figures, using the QPCR method, were calculated consistently with the method set forth under the 2013 BiOp. Because the 2013 BiOp uses the QPCR method and is the current governing document defining when an incidental take occurs, the 81 and 91 percent calculations are the relevant figures for evaluating when the triggers are met. The 2013 BiOp does not provide guidance on the weighted-by-abundance metric nor establish any standard for unacceptable disease levels using it. The parties are bound by their obligation to measure the POI rates consistently with the 2013 BiOp; my previous order regarding reinitiation stands. Should the federal defendants now believe that the weighted-by-abundance metric reflects the best available science, they are strongly urged to make this change accordingly in an updated Biological Opinion as soon as possible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Intervenors nonetheless suggest that this conclusion only relates to whether federal defendants were obligated to reinitiate consultation, not to whether the injunctions should be suspended or modified. They argue that they have offered newly discovered evidence because the weighted-by-abundance method is the more accurate metric to measure the POI rate. With more authoritative evidence that the actual POI rates were in fact 18 and 29 percent, I would be inclined to agree. But federal defendants' supplemental brief raises some important concerns about the value of these figures. They explain that the 18 and 29 percent figures \"do not lend themselves to direct comparison to the 39 percent trigger for reinitiation in the Take Statement\" because they \"utilize different methodologies\" and \"are different statistical techniques.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hoopa Dkt.

While the national wildlife refuges are certainly important and benefit the public interest, intervenors do not provide any information (let alone new information) regarding the effects of the injunctions on the wildlife refuges that would allow me to evaluate whether application of the injunctions would be inequitable due to its effects. For these reasons, intervenors have failed to show that they are entitled to relief from the judgment pursuant to either Rules 60(b)(2) or 60(b)(5), as they have not shown any \"newly discovered evidence\" nor that prospective application of the Injunction Orders would be inequitable. For\n   these reasons, intervenors' motion is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    III. The Federal Defendants' Proposed Modifications to the Injunction Orders\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Federal defendants do not join in intervenors' motion. However, they respond that full compliance with the injunctions is not possible without impermissibly harming the endangered sucker fish due to the current hydrological conditions. They instead present a voluntary proposed operations plan that they characterize as the best means of implementing the Modified Injunction Orders in water year 2018, along with a proposed order approving that plan. Plaintiffs argue that federal defendants may not implement their proposed operations plan because it is contrary to and inconsistent with the Injunction Orders, and dispute the evidence underlying their position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The posture of this briefing is odd in that neither federal defendants nor plaintiffs have formally moved this Court for any form of relief. Federal defendants, because they recognize that plaintiffs vehemently dispute their proposed operations plan as well as its propriety under the Modified Injunction Orders, could have sought an order from this Court clarifying the Modified Injunction Orders or otherwise moved for relief. Plaintiffs could have sought a contempt order if they believed that federal defendants were not in compliance with the orders. Pursuant to my power under Rule 62(c) to preserve the status quo, I will interpret the federal defendants' brief as a request for clarification of the Modified Injunction Orders and evaluate their proposed plan's propriety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   On March 23, 2018, federal defendants contended that, given the current water flows, implementation of both Management Guidance Measures 1 (regarding winter-spring surface flushing flows) and 4 (regarding emergency dilution flows), as mandated, were not possible without impermissibly diverting water from and therefore harming the endangered suckerfish. But as a result of an intervening natural storm event, federal defendants reported on April 6 that they were able to implement Measure 1 on April 6.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hoopa Dkt. No. 149; Yurok Dkt. No. 115. Because Measure 1 is no longer at issue, those portions of the federal defendants' response pertaining to it are now moot and I will not address them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Turning to Measure 4, federal defendants \"do not read\" the Modified Injunction Orders as requiring partial implementation in the event that full implementation is not possible and contend that partial implementation would not further the injunctions' goal of reducing disease infection rates.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hoopa Dkt. No. 145-1 at 9, 16; Yurok Dkt. No. 109-1 at 9, 16. They instead suggest foregoing implementation of Measure 4 entirely. By foregoing Measure 4, the Bureau will also avoid a complete shutoff of irrigation deliveries that may result from partial implementation of Measure 4, and will be able to provide a total of 252,000 acre feet of water to the irrigation districts.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Federal defendants' suggestion that they forego any attempt at all to comply with Measure 4 is clearly inconsistent with the Injunction Orders. Given the pending appeal, it is beyond my power to grant approval of their proposed plan. Even if it were within my power, I would deny it because federal defendants have not shown why so-called partial compliance is preferable and more consistent with the Modified Injunction Orders should full compliance not be possible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Although federal defendants claim that they cannot implement a full 50 TAF emergency dilution flow under Measure 4\n   by April 1, as the injunctions mandate, they concede that they would be able to do so by May 20.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hoopa Dkt. No. 149-1 at 2; Yurok Dkt. No. 105-1 at 2. They further state that, under their modeling, they will likely be only 3 TAF shy of the full 50 TAF to implement a flow event on April 30.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hoopa Dkt. No. 149-1 at 3; Yurok Dkt. No. 105-1 at 3. Federal defendants argue that such partial implementation would not provide the population-level disease benefits; they propose foregoing Measure 4 entirely. The FWS Technical Memo on which they base their argument, however, merely states that there are \"uncertainties\" regarding the potential effectiveness that have admittedly been \"previously discussed.\" FWS Technical Memo at 5. But whether the effects of the dilution flow can be accurately predicted because of the relative lack of high flow events since disease sampling began, for example, does not mean that a dilution flow would be ineffective or speak to its effectiveness at all. Nor does the fact that water released from the Iron Gate Dam might not generate the same proportional increase in discharge at lower river sample states mean that the discharges would be ineffective. Each of federal defendants' concerns merely raises questions but does not provide evidence that Measure 4 would not achieve its goals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   These arguments do not focus on the effectiveness of\n   <em>\n    partial\n   </em>\n   implementation, but rather raise the same concerns regarding Measure 4 in its entirety that were raised and considered prior to the Injunction Orders. This is underscored by federal defendants' statement that they object to the implementation of Measure 4 \"either in whole or in part.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hoopa Dkt. No. 149-1 at 3; Yurok Dkt. No. 105-1 at 3. Federal defendants' arguments are no more convincing today than they were at the time of the Injunction Orders; even if they were, it is beyond my power at this stage to grant their proposed plan as it would substantially alter the status quo.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   In the event that full compliance is not possible, I clarify that the Injunction Orders demand partial compliance. The Orders specifically state that \"[t]he Bureau shall manage the Klamath Reclamation Project (\"Project\"), including Project deliveries from upper Klamath Lake (\"UKL\"), in a manner that will not preclude the ability to provide Reserve Water to implement\n   <em>\n    up to\n   </em>\n   50 TAF of emergency dilution flows and/or interfere with its ability to meet its obligations under the ESA with regard to endangered suckers and/or their critical habitat.\" Modified Injunction Orders at \u00b6 13 (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 14(c) (\"Emergency dilution releases using up to 50 TAF of Reserve Water shall be implemented....\"). The Modified Injunction Orders thus recognizes that fewer than 50 TAF of Reserve Water may be necessary in order to reach the specified flow targets, and depending on the environmental conditions, the objectives of Measure 4 might still be fully implemented despite the difficult hydrological conditions. Thus, simply because federal defendants cannot meet the 50 TAF recommendation by April 1 does not mean that they should forego maintaining any Reserve Water at all.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Moreover, the Orders also presents federal defendants' duty to implement Measure 4 as an ongoing obligation: \"Each year this plan is in effect, the Bureau shall establish a 50,000 acre foot (\"50 TAF\") Reserve Water (\"Reserve Water\") supply to implement the emergency dilution flows modeled on Management Guidance # 4 as described in paragraph 14 herein. Reserve Water shall be available from April 1 through the earlier of the two cessation dates identified ....\" Modified Injunction Orders at \u00b6 12. Partial compliance is clearly the Bureau's obligation under the injunctions\n   and aligns with the injunctions' goals of protecting the species and providing emergency dilution flows in the event that certain disease levels are reached.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Federal defendants' proposed alternative plan is clearly at odds with the injunctions and their objectives. As discussed at length in the Injunction Orders, the injunctions prioritizes first and foremost the wellbeing of the endangered species (both the Coho salmon and the sucker fish to the extent that they are affected), then the federally-protected rights of the tribes, and finally the rights of the irrigation districts. Federal defendants have not shown that so-called partial implementation cannot meet the objectives of the injunctions, nor that even some lesser amount of Reserve Water would provide no benefits. Because the injunctions demand partial compliance in the event that full compliance is not possible, federal defendants' proposal of releasing water to the Project is clearly inconsistent with their duties. Under the injunctions, they are not permitted to release any water to the irrigation districts that could be instead used to implement Measure 4, even if only partially.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   With respect to full compliance, plaintiffs argue that federal defendants have presented incomplete modeling, and that full compliance with both Measures 1 and 4 may be possible given the supplemental water available to implement Measure 1. Plaintiffs point out that federal defendants' models, underlying their contention that it is impossible to fully comply with both Measures 1 and 4 without endangering the sucker fish, do not take into consideration the available non-Project water.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hoopa Dkt. No. 146 at 21 (discussing Hoopa Dkt. No. 145-5, at 9-10, 15). The federal defendants present no model that shows the outcome with respect to Measure 4, assuming the use of non-Project water to fulfill Measure 1. Instead, they only take into consideration the non-Project water in their models of supporting their proposed plan, by which they would forego compliance with Measure 4 entirely.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hoopa Dkt. No. 146 at 22 (discussing Hoopa Dkt. No. 145-5, at 13). Given that federal defendants appear not to have modeled outcomes assuming use of non-Project water to fulfill Measure 1, their contention that it is impossible to fulfill both measures seems unfounded. Regardless, under the Modified Injunction Orders and as clarified by this Order, federal defendants must fulfill their duty at least to attempt full compliance with Measure 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Finally, I address plaintiffs' suggestion that the Bureau of Reclamation may have mismanaged its fall/winter water deliveries, thereby failing to comply with their duty to manage the Klamath Project deliveries from Upper Klamath Lake \"in a manner that will not preclude the ability to provide Reserve Water to implement up to 50 TAF of emergency dilution flows and/or interfere with its ability to meet its obligations under the ESA with regard to endangered suckers and/or their critical habitat.\" Modified Injunction Orders at \u00b6 13. Because of the disposition of these proceedings, I will not require the Bureau to provide the modeling showing the water levels with and without those deliveries at this time. However, the Bureau of Reclamation is reminded of its duties and obligations under the Modified Injunction Orders and should be prepared to defend with evidence the scientific bases of their decisions should they come into question at a later time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, intervenors' Rule 60(b) Motion for Relief from the Judgment is DENIED. This Order clarifies that the Modified Injunction Orders\n   demand partial compliance if full compliance is not possible, as is consistent with preserving the status quo pursuant to Rule 62(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    An identical version of this Order is filed in\n    <em>\n     Hoopa Valley Tribe v.
