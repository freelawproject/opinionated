(\"CGSI\") for discrimination and retaliation in violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (\"ADEA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20621\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 621\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , as well as for wrongful termination. Specifically, Mr. Golden alleges that after he complained to his supervisors at MTC and CGSI that he was receiving disparate pay and treatment based on his age, he was placed on an unnecessary Performance\n   Improvement Plan (\"PIP\") and then terminated. Now before the Court are MTC's and CGSI's motions to dismiss Mr. Golden's Second Amended Complaint. MTC has moved to dismiss on the ground that Mr. Golden's claims are either time-barred or insufficiently pleaded. CGSI has moved to dismiss on the ground that it never in fact employed Mr. Golden and that therefore it cannot be liable to him under the ADEA. In the alternative, it argues that Mr. Golden has failed to state a claim and that his claims are time-barred. For the reasons set forth below, the Court finds that Mr. Golden has stated claims against MTC for certain acts of age discrimination and retaliation, but not for wrongful termination. It further finds that Mr. Golden has stated a claim for retaliation against CGSI, but not for wrongful termination, and that his claim for age discrimination is time-barred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

MTC's Motion to Dismiss\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Mr. Golden's Second Amended Complaint contains claims of retaliation, wrongful discharge, and age discrimination against MTC. MTC has moved to dismiss on the grounds that a portion of Mr. Golden's claims are time-barred, that he did not plead a plausible inference of retaliation, that he did not state a prima facie case for age discrimination, and that he did not state a claim for wrongful discharge.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   MTC's Mem. Mr. Golden responds that it \"is simply not the case\" that his Second Amended Complaint is based off of incidents that occurred before April 24, 2015, that he has pleaded a prima facie case of age discrimination, and that his Second Amended Complaint contains sufficient facts to plead a plausible inference of retaliation.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp'n MTC's Mot. For the reasons given below, the Court finds that Mr. Golden's claims for retaliation and discrimination based on events occurring before April 24, 2015 are time-barred, but that Mr. Golden has pleaded sufficient facts to state timely claims for discrimination and retaliation based on his termination. However, the Court finds that Mr. Golden has failed to state a claim for wrongful termination, and therefore dismisses that claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

In particular, it first argues that any claims that were contained in both Mr. Golden's first EEOC charge and his second EEOC charge are barred because he did not file suit on those twice-alleged claims within 90 days of the issuance of the EEOC's first right-to-sue letter.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p570\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Similarly, it argues that any claim based on actions that occurred before April 24, 2015, are time-barred because Mr. Golden did not file his second EEOC charge until February 18, 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12. Mr. Golden responds that the actions about which he has sued occurred after April 24, 2015, because \"the retaliatory conduct that serves as a basis for his administrative and judicial complaints stem from (1) being placed on a second PIP that should have never happened because it was not warranted; and[ ] ultimately (2) being terminated for it in July 2015 for allegedly not successfully completing the requirements of a PIP despite receiving a satisfactory rating from his supervisors during that particular rating period.\" Pl.'s Opp'n MTC's Mot. at 7.

Additionally, MTC highlights that in his first EEOC charge, Mr. Golden alleged, in between two sentences\n   regarding events that occurred during the fall of 2014, that he \"discovered [that he] was paid less than other employees for the same position and similar duties.\" 1st EEOC Charge. Therefore, MTC argues, Mr. Golden's claim that he complained about receiving disparate pay in 2011 directly conflicts with his first EEOC charge, which implies that he learned about the disparate pay during the fall of 2014. For these reasons, MTC argues, these new \"alternative facts\" \"seem to lack [a] good faith basis.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   It can be \"appropriate for the court to look beyond the amended complaint to the record, which includes the original complaint,\" when evaluating whether a plaintiff has stated a claim upon which relief may be granted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    W.

First, when Mr. Golden described the concerns he raised with his supervisors in April 2011 in his First Amended Complaint, he specified that his complaints \"included but were not limited to the following,\" 1st Am. Compl. \u00b6 10, implying that he also made other complaints to his supervisors. He has now clarified what those other complaints were.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2d Am. Compl. \u00b6 11. While it is certainly suspicious that, if Mr. Golden had indeed raised concerns with his supervisor that younger employees were receiving preferential treatment, he did not include his reporting of those concerns in his original complaint, his original complaint did expressly state that he raised more concerns than the thirteen enumerated in his original complaint to his supervisors. Therefore, his Second Amended Complaint does not directly contradict his First Amended Complaint in this regard. While the incongruity of these allegations may impact the plaintiff's credibility, that is a matter to be determined by the finder of fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Second, MTC argues that because Mr. Golden's Second Amended Complaint claims that he first complained about his allegedly disparate pay in 2011, but his first EEOC charge implies that he did not even learn about the disparate pay until 2014, his allegation regarding when he discovered and first complained about his allegedly disparate pay should be disregarded. However, while Mr. Golden's first EEOC charge\n   <em>\n    implies\n   </em>\n   that he first learned about his disparate pay in 2014, it does not state that that is when he discovered it outright. But even if it did, that would not require the Court to discount the two other instances Mr. Golden alleges he complained\n   to his supervisors about his disparate pay and treatment after the fall of 2014, the two instances temporally closest to his placement on the second PIP and ultimate termination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2d Am. Compl. \u00b6 12(d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Similarly, MTC expresses concern that Mr. Golden has more than doubled the number of instances during which he complained about his treatment to his supervisors and has included instances not found in either of his EEOC charges or his First Amended Complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MTC's Mem. at 13-14. Just as enumerating what other complaints Mr. Golden made to his supervisor does not contradict the list of complaints he says he raised in his First Amended Complaint, adding instances when he is alleged to have complained to supervisors also does not contradict his contention in his First Amended Complaint that he complained in April 2011 and October 2013. Because MTC \"has not identified any true contradictions to undermine the credibility of the amended complaint,\" the Court will accept the additional facts included in the Second Amended Complaint as true.\n   <em>\n    Price v.

Compl. \u00b6 12(d). Additionally, he alleges that he engaged in protected activity one month before he was placed on his second PIP, and while his placement on the PIP is not itself actionable, it can serve as background evidence demonstrating that his termination was discriminatory or retaliatory. At this stage of the proceedings,\n   these alleged facts are sufficient to raise a plausible inference that MTC retaliated against Mr. Golden.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   MTC has raised several additional arguments to support its contention that Mr. Golden has not properly pleaded a claim for retaliation. First, it argues that Mr. Golden has failed to exhaust his administrative remedies because he has alleged new instances of protected activity in his Second Amended Complaint that do not correspond with those found in his second EEOC charge.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MTC's Mem. at 16. To support its contention that Mr. Golden's factual allegations in his administrative charge must perfectly match the factual allegation in his complaint, MTC cites to two out-of-circuit cases. However, neither of these cases establish as strict a pleading requirement as MTC suggests. In\n   <em>\n    Chacko v. Patuxent Inst.\n   </em>\n   , the court held that \"a plaintiff fails to exhaust his administrative remedies where, as here, his administrative charges reference different time frames, actors, and discriminatory conduct than the central factual allegations in his formal suit.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1554034\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/429/505/#p506\">\n    429 F.3d 505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 506 (4th Cir. 2005). Additionally, in\n   <em>\n    Johnson v. Portfolio Recovery Assocs. LLC\n   </em>\n   , the court found that, where a \"[p]laintiff did not explicitly include retaliation in his EEOC charge,\" and did not \"show that his retaliation claim can be fairly read as being related to or expected to follow from the administrative investigation of his race discrimination claim or any other allegations in the EEOC charge,\" he did not exhaust his administrative remedies as to his retaliation claim.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3595249\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/682/560/#p577\">\n    682 F.Supp.2d 560\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 577 (E.D. Va. 2009). Neither of these holdings apply to Mr. Golden's second EEOC charge, which includes an allegation that as a result of what he perceived to be disparate treatment, he \"filed multiple internal EEO complaints that were left unaddressed.\" 2d EEOC Charge. In his Second Amended Complaint, he included further details of when he made those complaints, to whom he made them, and what disparate treatment he specifically complained about.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2d Am.

Mr. Golden included in his charge a list of actions that MTC took that he believed were improper, including disparate compensation and treatment, placement on a PIP, and termination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2d EEOC Charge. He then, following this list, informed the EEOC that he was discriminated and retaliated against in violation of the ADEA.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5876611\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/576/72/#p82\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   He did not specify which actions in the previous list he believed were discriminatory or retaliatory, or whether there were any actions on the list that he believed were one but not the other. \"Documents filed by an employee with the EEOC should be construed, to the extent consistent with permissible rules of interpretation, to protect the employee's rights and statutory remedies.\"\n   <em>\n    Fed.

Therefore, because Mr. Golden did not specify which of MTC's actions he believed were discriminatory or retaliatory, the Court will read his charge as alleging that each action was both discriminatory and retaliatory. Because Mr. Golden included a claim for discriminatory termination in his second EEOC charge, the same termination he complains of in his Second Amended Complaint, he has exhausted his administrative remedies as to that claim. Although the exhaustion requirement requires a plaintiff to administratively exhaust each\n   <em>\n    claim\n   </em>\n   , it does not require that a plaintiff include in an administrative charge all the evidence upon which a claim is based.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    4.

Mr. Golden's opposition to MTC's motion to dismiss contains no arguments to counter MTC's contentions regarding the sufficiency of his pleadings. Indeed, Mr. Golden's opposition to MTC's motion only mentions the phrase \"wrongful termination\" or \"wrongful discharge\" twice, in the introduction, when it describes the claims contained in his Second Amended Complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp'n MTC's Mot. at 1-2.

CGSI has moved to dismiss on several grounds, arguing that the Second Amended Complaint does not sufficiently allege that CGSI was Mr. Golden's employer or that it discriminated or retaliated against him; that his age discrimination claim is time-barred because he first included that claim in this suit 465 days after receiving his right-to-sue letter from the EEOC; and that the Second Amended Complaint fails to state a wrongful termination claim.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   CGSI's Mem.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   P. &amp; A.

For the reasons set forth below, the Court finds that Mr. Golden has failed to state a claim for wrongful termination and did not timely file his claim for age discrimination. However, the Court finds that he succeeded in stating a timely claim for retaliation and therefore does not dismiss his retaliation claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

In its previous Memorandum Opinion, the Court found that Mr. Golden's First Amended Complaint did not allege sufficient facts to infer that CGS (which at that point had been erroneously sued instead of CGSI) had employed Mr. Golden, because \"[a]lthough Golden allege[d] that CGSI maintained a human resources director at the [Potomac Job Corps facility] ... [that] oversaw the duties and responsibilities of MTC's hired staff including [Golden], it is not tantamount to an allegation that CGSI could control and direct both the details and results of Golden's work or that it controlled the terms and conditions of his employment.\"\n   <em>\n    Golden\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264587\" index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/266/277/#p282\">\n    266 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   287 n.8 (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). Mr. Golden has alleged new facts regarding CGSI's control over his work and now contends that he has alleged sufficient facts to allow for an inference at this stage in the proceedings that both MTC and CGSI employed him. The Court agrees. While Mr. Golden's description of how much control CGSI exercised over him at the Job Corps site is still thin, the complaint now contains sufficient factual allegations to allow for an inference that CGSI also employed him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The D.C.
