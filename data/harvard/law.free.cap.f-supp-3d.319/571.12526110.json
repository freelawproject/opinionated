HarborOne requested that he start by June 27, 2013, so that he would be eligible for an employee bonus in February 2014. During his tenure, Innocent's branch became a top performer for HarborOne after previously performing near the bottom. At the beginning of 2014, Innocent presented his yearly business plan to his direct supervisor. His plan included a request for an increased cash limit for his branch, which he felt was warranted based on the increased customer base during his tenure. Sometime in 2014, Innocent reminded O'Halloran of the promised bonus. She got upset and referred Innocent to the Human Resources Department. Innocent was told there would be no bonus without any explanation other than that he was not entitled to it. Innocent continued to work six days a week for about four months. Donahue felt he needed to work more and requested he research and write a paper about money laundering as it relates to a client that was recently acquired through his business efforts. He was also asked to be an ambassador to the South Shore Chamber of Commerce. Innocent felt that he was being overworked and told O'Halloran that he may have a heart attack if issues such as the cash limit for his branch weren't solved. O'Halloran just laughed. O'Halloran would get irritated when he shared his and his teams' concern about opening accounts for minors without confirming the identification of the accompanying adult.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Innocent alleges that the Defendants retaliated against him by: (1) creating a stressful work environment; (2) putting his and his families' lives in danger by secretly submitting damaging and unnecessary reports to government agencies; (3) pressuring him to sign a \"mutual agreement\"; and (4) denying him access to his personal belongings. He also alleges that due to Defendants' retaliatory conduct, he has been unable to find employment since November 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Standard of Review\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, the Court \"must assume the truth of all well-plead[ed] facts and give plaintiff the benefit of all reasonable inferences therefrom.\"\n   <em>\n    Ruiz v.

In this case, Innocent, who left his employment with HarborOne on November 21, 2014,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   had to file his discrimination charge with the EEOC by May 20, 2015 (or by September 17, 2015 if he first filed a discrimination charge with the MCAD). Innocent does not assert in his Complaint that he filed a charge with the EEOC or\n   MCAD. Moreover, in his opposition, Innocent does not state that he filed an administrative complaint, rather he essentially argues that he can pursue his Title VII retaliation claim without having done so. He is incorrect. Simply put, his failure to exhaust his administrative remedies bars his Title VII claim and his Complaint must be dismissed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jorge v.

While failure to exhaust administrative remedies will bar a plaintiff from bringing suit in federal court, exhaustion is not a jurisdictional requirement. Therefore, the appropriate grounds for dismissal is a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6).\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Vera v.

In their memorandum in support of their motion to dismiss, Defendants state that Innocent's employment ended on November 21, 2014. Since Plaintiff does not dispute this date in his opposition, I will assume that his employment ended,\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    , he suffered an adverse employment action, on November 21, 2014. Since the other retaliatory actions he complains of occurred during the course of his employment, November 21, 2014 would be the last day on which Defendants could have engaged in any unlawful employment practices.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    The Defendants have attached a copy of the Separation Agreement to their memorandum, and their statement of facts includes a summary of its terms and the circumstances surrounding its execution. Parties are generally barred from raising issues of fact or including extrinsic material with a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss.\n    <em>\n     Watterson v.

However, courts may consider those documents the authenticity of which are not in dispute, such as public records, or documents substantially incorporated into a complaint by reference.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10507731\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/987/1/#p3\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10507731\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/987/1/#p3\">\n     at 3-4\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (internal citations omitted). Plaintiff's Complaint includes a few references to a \"mutual agreement\". It is likely that the \"mutual agreement\" he refers to and the Separation Agreement are one and the same. There is then the related issue of whether the Separation Agreement is \"substantially incorporated into the complaint\" such that I should consider it in deciding the motion to dismiss. Given my ruling, I need not resolve these issues.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <p id=\"p-22\">\n    <em>\n     <strong>\n      Conclusion\n     </strong>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-23\">\n    Defendants HarborOne Bank, James Blake, Leo Donahue, Patricia Williams And Carrie O'Halloran's Motion To Dismiss (Docket No. 13) is\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      granted\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
