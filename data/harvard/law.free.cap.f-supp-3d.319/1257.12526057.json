DALTON JR., United States District Judge\n   Amid an unprecedented financial crisis, the federal government injected billions of dollars into the country's largest financial institutions to tourniquet the hemorrhaging national economy. A key feature of this bank bailout was the Home Affordable Modification Program (\"\n   <strong>\n    HAMP\n   </strong>\n   \"), under which banks, including Defendant Bank of America, N.A. (\"\n   <strong>\n    BOA\n   </strong>\n   \"), received payments from the government to provide mortgage loan modifications to homeowners, including Plaintiff Carmen Brexendorf (\"\n   <strong>\n    Brexendorf\n   </strong>\n   \"). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 41.) As a purported victim of BOA's scheme to cash in on the broken American dream of home ownership, Brexendorf filed this fraud action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Now before the Court is BOA's Motion to Dismiss the Second Amended Complaint (Doc. 43 (\"\n   <strong>\n    Motion\n   </strong>\n   \") ), to which Brexendorf responded (Doc. 45). On review, the Motion is due to be granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In 2006, Brexendorf purchased a home in Kissimmee, Florida for $260,000 with a mortgage serviced by BOA. (Doc. 41, \u00b6 37.) Falling on hard times in 2009, and with default imminent, Brexendorf contacted BOA and requested a loan modification under HAMP. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39.) Implemented in March 2009, the HAMP program was intended to break the tidal wave of foreclosures facing many American homeowners by restructuring mortgage loans already in default, or those in imminent risk of default, by reducing monthly payments to a manageable level. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   BOA's participation in the HAMP program was governed by its Servicer Participation Agreement (\"\n   <strong>\n    Agreement\n   </strong>\n   \") entered into with the United States' financial agent, Federal National Mortgage Association. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12; Doc. 41-1, p. 3.) The Agreement required BOA to \"to use 'reasonable efforts' to effectuate any modification of a mortgage loan under the [p]rogram.\" (Doc. 41, \u00b6\u00b6 12-13, 16.) A HAMP modification proceeds in two stages. First, an eligible borrower applies for a temporary loan modification and receives a Trial Payment Period (\"\n   <strong>\n    Trial Period\n   </strong>\n   \") during which mortgage payments are made under the terms of the modification. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 13-14.) If a borrower complies with the Trial Period terms, the second stage consists of the borrower and servicer entering into a Modification Agreement, wherein the terms of the original mortgage loan are modified for five years. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 14-15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Brexendorf followed this first step and received written confirmation of her modification approval. But despite her having made several Trial Period payments, BOA foreclosed on her home on May 12, 2014. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 56.) Now, Brexendorf claims that BOA perpetuated a scheme to feign compliance with the Agreement and avoid approving her HAMP application. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 18, 31.) She asserts a common law fraud\n   claim (\"\n   <strong>\n    Fraud Claim\n   </strong>\n   \") and a violation of the Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act (\"\n   <strong>\n    FDUTPA Claim\n   </strong>\n   \") against BOA for this alleged fraudulent conduct. (Doc. 41, \u00b6\u00b6 80-108).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In her Fraud Claim, Brexendorf alleges BOA committed five fraudulent acts: (1) telling her that \"being 'past due and in default' on her mortgage was a prerequisite for a HAMP modification\" and failing to tell her that she could qualify for HAMP if default was imminent (\"\n   <strong>\n    HAMP Eligibility Misrepresentation\n   </strong>\n   \"); (2) telling her the requested supporting financial documents Brexendorf submitted to BOA were \"not received,\" \"incomplete,\" or \"not current\" (\"\n   <strong>\n    Supporting Documents Misrepresentation\n   </strong>\n   \"); (3) telling her that she was approved for a HAMP modification and needed to start making trial payments (\"\n   <strong>\n    HAMP Approval Misrepresentation\n   </strong>\n   \"); (4) omitting its practice of placing Trial Period payments into \"unapplied accounts\" (\"\n   <strong>\n    Trial Payments Omission\n   </strong>\n   \"); and (5) omitting how inspection fees charged to Brexendorf's account would be applied (\"\n   <strong>\n    Inspection Fee Omissions\n   </strong>\n   \") (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 41-43, 47, 53-54, 62). Such conduct, according to Brexendorf, also violates FDUTPA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 98.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Biting back, BOA seeks dismissal of the Second Amended Complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). (Doc. 43 (\"\n   <strong>\n    Motion\n   </strong>\n   \").) Briefing complete (Doc. 45), the matter is now ripe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In its Motion, BOA argues that Brexendorf's Fraud and FDUTPA Claims, regardless of the misrepresentation or omission, are barred by the statute of limitations, Florida's Banking Statute of Frauds, and the failure to satisfy an express condition precedent. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 43, pp. 6-12.) BOA also contends that the Fraud Claim violates Rule 9(b) by failing to allege circumstances constituting fraud with sufficient particularity. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-21.) Finally, BOA posits that Brexendorf has failed to state a FDUTPA claim. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21-23.) These arguments are addressed in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Statute of Limitations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   BOA first argues that both of Brexendorf's claims are time-barred under the applicable statute of limitations. (Doc. 43, pp. 1, 6-8.) A statute of limitations defense is an affirmative defense and BOA bears the burden of proof.\n   <em>\n    La Grasta v. First Union Secs., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9295994\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/358/840/#p845\">\n    358 F.3d 840\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 845 (11th Cir. 2004). Dismissal on this ground is appropriate only if it is apparent from the face of the complaint that the claim is time-barred.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9295994\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/358/840/#p845\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

Throughout 2009 and 2010, Brexendorf dutifully complied with BOA's advice and payment plan-falling into default on her mortgage and making nine Trial Period payments. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43, 56.) When BOA informed Brexendorf that her supporting documents were either not current, incomplete, or not received, she resubmitted them. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 50.) Using her default status against her, BOA did not apply her Trial Period payments to her outstanding mortgage balance. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 45, 56.) As a result, BOA foreclosed on her home on May 12, 2014. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 41, 56.) On November 20, 2014-five years after beginning the HAMP process-BOA informed Brexendorf that it denied her HAMP application. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 57.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Seizing on the allegations that the alleged misrepresentations and omissions were made in 2009 and 2010, BOA submits that the Fraud Claim is time-barred because its conduct occurred seven years before Brexendorf initiated suit on December 1, 2017. (Doc. 43, pp. 6-7.) But Brexendorf alleges that she could not have discovered the facts giving rise to BOA's fraud in 2009 and 2010 given BOA's efforts to conceal the circumstances of her HAMP eligibility, processing, and approval. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 41, \u00b6\u00b6 70, 72.) Relying on the Delayed Discovery Doctrine, Brexendorf argues that her Fraud Claim is timely. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 45, pp. 4-5.) Accepting her allegations as true, it is not apparent from the face of the\n   Second Amended Complaint that Brexendorf should have discovered the facts giving rise to the Fraud Claim in 2009 and 2010, at least to the extent it rests on the HAMP Eligibility Misrepresentation, Supporting Documents Misrepresentation, HAMP Approval Misrepresentation, and Trial Payments Omissions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    La Grasta\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9295994\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/358/840/#p845\">\n    358 F.3d at 845\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Rather, viewing the facts in the light most favorable to Brexendorf, the Fraud Claim based on these four fraudulent acts\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   have accrued when BOA foreclosed on Brexendorf's home on May 12, 2014. Discovery may cast such facts in a more ominous light; however, at the pleading stage, the Court declines to dismiss the Fraud Claim as time-barred, at least to the extent it rests on the HAMP Eligibility Misrepresentation, Supporting Documents Misrepresentation, HAMP Approval Misrepresentation, and Trial Payments Omission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Not so for the Inspection Fee Omissions. Brexendorf alleges that BOA charged her account for a property inspection on sixty-one occasions between 2008 and 2014, including December 10, 2009; January 15, 2010; March 19, 2010; June 24, 2010; and July 20, 2010. (Doc. 41, \u00b6 61.) But this statute of limitations on the Inspection Fee Omissions began to run on the date BOA charged Brexendorf's account.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Alonso v. Bank of Am., N.A.\n   </em>\n   , No. 8:17-cv-2547-T-33MAP,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%202215052\">\n    2018 WL 2215052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (M.D. Fla. May 15, 2018) (concluding that the plaintiff's fraud claim based on inspection fee omissions accrued when those fees were charged). A diligent mortgagor would and could have checked her bank account and noticed these fees. Thus, the specific charges Brexendorf alleges occurred in 2009 and 2010 are barred by the statute of limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   As to Brexendorf's allusions of similar fraudulent conduct extending into 2014, she offers no specific dates. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 41, \u00b6 61.) This renders it impossible for the Court to determine whether such conduct is time-barred. Given that Brexendorf initiated this suit on December 1, 2017, the only alleged inspection fees that could give rise to her Fraud Claim must have occurred on or after December 1, 2013. Nevertheless, absent contrary factual allegations, the Inspection Fee Omissions are not subject to dismissal on statute of limitations grounds.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    La Grasta\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9295994\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/358/840/#p845\">\n    358 F.3d at 845\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    2. FDUTPA Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   BOA also contends that the FDUTPA Claim, which arises from the same alleged misrepresentations and omissions, is time-barred. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 43, pp. 1, 6.) FDUTPA claims are subject to a four-year statute of limitations applicable to lawsuits based on statutory liability.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2095.11\">\n    Fla.

The Banking Statute of Frauds provides that a debtor may not sue a creditor over a credited agreement absent a signed, written document.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20687.0304\">\n    Fla.

Additionally, Florida's Banking Statute of Frauds precludes fraud claims where a borrower has alleged that the lender orally agreed to make financial accommodations to the borrower.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Coral Reef Drive Land Dev., LLC v.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 41, \u00b6 53.) Indeed, Brexendorf alleges that\n   BOA agreed to and did make a financial accommodation in the form of reduced Trial Period payments. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Therefore, to the extent the Fraud Claim is based on the HAMP Approval Misrepresentation it is due to be dismissed with prejudice.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Alonso\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%202215052\">\n    2018 WL 2215052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3. Because none of the other misrepresentations and omissions underpinning the Fraud Claim involve a credit agreement for purposes of the Banking Statute of Frauds, they are not barred.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Rule 9(b)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Next, BOA seeks dismissal of the Fraud Claim because Brexendorf has not satisfied the heightened pleading standard required by Rule 9(b). (Doc. 43, pp. 13-21.) Rule 9(b) requires a plaintiff alleging fraud to \"state with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake.\" To state a claim for common law fraud, a plaintiff must allege that: (1) the defendant made a false representation of material fact; (2) the defendant knew that the representation was false; (3) the defendant made the representation to induce the plaintiff to act in reliance on it; (4) detrimental reliance, and (5) injury.\n   <em>\n    Berkery v.

App'x 904\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 909 (11th Cir. 2010).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Rule 9(b) also requires identifying: (1) the precise statements, documents, or misrepresentations made; (2) the time and place of, and persons responsible for, the statement; (3) the content and manner in which the statements misled the plaintiff; and (4) what the defendant gained by the alleged fraud.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ambrosia Coal &amp; Const. co. v. Pages Morales\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=482%20F.3d%201309\">\n    482 F.3d 1309\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1316-17 (11th Cir. 2007). Although BOA attacks each of the five alleged misrepresentations and omissions, because the HAMP Approval Misrepresentation and portions of the Inspection Fee Omissions are time-barred, the Court addresses only the remaining misrepresentations and omissions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    1. HAMP Eligibility Misrepresentation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In her attempt to obtain a HAMP modification, Brexendorf alleges that on November 25, 2009, BOA's loan representative, Ken, advised her \"to refrain from making her regular mortgage payments\" because \"being 'past due and in default' \" was a perquisite for a modification. (Doc. 41, \u00b6 41.) To qualify for a HAMP Modification, however, a mortgagor need not be in default, as imminent default is sufficient. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42.) Brexendorf maintains that Ken made this false statement to induce her reliance, triggering a purposeful default on her mortgage. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Her loss of home equity and \"money paid as trial payments\" to BOA demonstrate damage from the false statements. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43.) At the pleading stage, the Fraud Claim based on the HAMP Eligibility Misrepresentation survives dismissal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Supporting Documents Misrepresentation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   When applying for the HAMP modification, Brexendorf sent supporting financial documents to BOA and was told that the documents were not received, incomplete, or not current. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 47.) Although Brexendorf alleges these statements were false, she fails to support this allegation with specific facts. Instead, she\n   states only in a conclusory fashion that the statements were false and \"BOA employees\" knew this. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=482%20F.3d%201309\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ). Rule 9(b) requires more and, thus, the Fraud Claim based on the Supporting Documents Misrepresentation is dismissed without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Trial Payment Omission\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   On November 20, 2009, BOA allegedly sent Brexendorf a letter informing her that her application was \"approved\" and instructed her to make trial payments. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 53.) She complied, making nine Trial Period payments of about $868 in 2009 and 2010 with the belief that such payments were being applied to her mortgage. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 56.) Instead, BOA placed the Trial Period payments in an \"unapplied account.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 55.) Brexendorf alleges that \"BOA employees\" omitted this fact when requesting the trial payments. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Absent specific facts about when the alleged omissions were made and by whom, the Trial Payment Omission fall short of the particularity required by Rule 9(b). Hence the Fraud Claim based on the Trial Payment Omission is due to be dismissed without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Inspection Fee Omissions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Finally, as the Court previously noted, Brexendorf's allegations concerning the Inspection Fee Omissions purportedly reach into 2013 and 2014. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 61.) Yet again, Plaintiff relies on generalized allegations of BOA's conduct (\n   <em>\n    see\n    <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=482%20F.3d%201309\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ), which do not satisfy the particularity required by Rule 9(b). So the Fraud Claim based on timely Inspection Fee Omissions-that is, those\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   December 1, 2013-is due to be dismissed without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Failure to State a FDUTPA claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Brexendorf also asserts that BOA is liable under FDUTPA because it perpetuated a \"methodical scheme to avoid its responsibilities under the HAMP Agreement and [incentivized] its employees ... to make knowing material misrepresentations to borrowers.\" (Doc. 41, \u00b6 98.) FDUTPA declares unlawful \"unfair or deceptive acts or practices\" committed \"in the conduct of any trade or commerce.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20501.204\">\n    Fla. Stat. \u00a7 501.204\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1). BOA contends that this claim must fail because as a federally-regulated bank it is exempted from FDUTPA liability. (Doc. 43, p. 21.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   FDUTPA does not apply to \"banks, credit unions, and savings and loan associations regulated by federal agencies.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20501.212\">\n    Fla. Stat. \u00a7 501.212\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (4)(c). Contrary to BOA's argument (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 22), its status as a federally-regulated bank is not apparent from the Second Amended Complaint. So the Court declines to dismiss the FDUTPA Claim on this basis.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Christie v. Bank of Am., N.A.\n   </em>\n   , No. 8:13-cv-1371-T-23TBM,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%205285987\">\n    2014 WL 5285987\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (M.D. Fla.
