The facts arise out of Dyck O'Neal's efforts to collect a mortgage deficiency that Saunders alleges her ex-husband owes. From 2015 through 2017, Dyck O'Neal called repeatedly and left a number of voicemails on Saunders' phone. Dyck O'Neal used a vender called VoApp to leave prerecorded \"direct drop\" voicemails. From April 2016 to April 2017, Dyck O'Neal left approximately thirty of these voicemail messages on Saunders' phone. Saunders alleges that these voicemails are a violation of the TCPA. Dyck O'Neal filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that the voicemails are not a violation. (ECF No. 35.) The matter is fully briefed. For the reasons that follow, the Court will deny Dyck O'Neal's motion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Applicable Law\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Summary judgment is appropriate if there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.

Dyck O'Neal then began to contact Saunders in an attempt to collect the debt. In addition to calls, Dyck O'Neal left approximately thirty automated voicemail messages on Saunders' phone over a one-year period-each time, Saunders would receive a notification on her phone that she had a new voicemail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Dyck O'Neal contracts with VoApp, a third-party vendor, to deliver messages to individuals' voicemails using VoApp's \"DirectDROP\" voicemail service. Rather than call the target's phone number and wait to reach the target's voicemail, VoApp utilizes technology to reach the target's voicemail through a back door. Specifically, VoApp's Adaptive Signaling technology \"causes the mobile switch to make a call to a phone number assigned to the voicemail service provider's enhanced service platform (i.e. the voicemail computer or server), not the consumer's phone number.\" (ECF No. 27 at PageID.97.) By routing the message through the voicemail server itself, VoApp is able to deliver a voicemail message to the server space associated with the consumer\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   -the consumer then receives a notification that she received a new voicemail message, but without having received a traditional call.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Dyck O'Neal provides three things to VoApp in order for VoApp to make its direct drop voicemail messages: (1) the target's phone numbers; (2) the caller ID number to be displayed on the target's voicemail screen; and (3) the prerecorded message to record into the target's voicemail box. VoApp then makes the respective \"calls\" on a repeated basis, and targeted consumers begin to receive notifications that they have a new voicemail message each time VoApp does so. The target must then take steps to listen to the voicemail and delete it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Discussion\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   This is a case of first impression.

The court analyzed the \"to make any call\" language, and looked to the \"ordinary, contemporary, and common meaning of the verb 'to call.' \" The court found that \"call\" in this context meant \"to communicate with or try to get into communication with a person by a telephone,\" and noted that text messaging was not available when the law was enacted in 1991.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3660977\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/569/946/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3660977\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/569/946/\">\n    at 953-54\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The FCC concluded, \"[f]inding otherwise-that merely adding a domain to the telephone number means the number has not been 'dialed'-when the effect on the recipient is identical, would elevate form over substance, thwart Congressional intent that evolving technologies not deprive mobile consumers of the TCPA's protections, and potentially open a floodgate of unwanted text messages to wireless consumers.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 115.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Dyck O'Neal emphasizes that it did not dial Saunders' cellular telephone number. Instead, Dyck O'Neal \"deposit[ed] a voicemail message directly on a voicemail service\"-an action it insists is unregulated. \"To do this, VoApp's patented Adapt-Sig technology created and transmitted a series of network signaling events into the network. Once a connection was established, the voice message was then played into the voice mail box from VoApp's server without ever placing a call to Plaintiff's mobile handset.\" (ECF No. 48 at PageID.492.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Dyck O'Neal's use of direct to voicemail technology is a \"call\" and falls within the purview of the TCPA. As a remedial statute, the Court construes the TCPA broadly in favor of Saunders. The statute itself casts a broad net-it regulates\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   call, and a \"call\" includes communication, or an attempt to communicate, via telephone. Both the FCC and the courts have recognized that the scope of the TCPA naturally evolves in parallel with telecommunications technology as it evolves,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , with the advent of text messages and email-to-text messages or, as we have here, new technology to get into a consumer's voicemail box directly. The TCPA was enacted in 1991; the equivalent act at that time could be considered a party recording a message directly on an answering machine's cassette tape without ever calling the number-an infeasible technological feat absent physical access to a consumer's answering machine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Saunders received the notifications of Dyck O'Neal's voicemails on her phone. She listened to the voicemails on her phone. Voicemails are intrinsically tied to cellular phones. By leaving a voicemail directly in the server space associated with Saunders' phone, Dyck O'Neal was attempting to communicate with Saunders via her phone-which is the definition applied to the TCPA's use of \"call.\" Further, Dyck O'Neal's automated message instructed Saunders to call them at a specific phone number-inviting additional communication over the telephone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The effect on Saunders is the same whether her phone rang with a call before the voicemail is left, or whether the voicemail is left directly in her voicemail box,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , Saunders receives a notification on her phone that she has a new voicemail. The effect on Saunders is also the same in receiving a text message-which would fall under the TCPA-each time, she received a notification on her phone that she had a new message, and had to take steps to review or delete the message. In fact, voicemails are arguably more of a nuisance to consumers than text messages. To limit the TCPA to instances where Dyck O'Neal specifically dialed Saunders' phone number and then reached her voicemail, and exclude Dyck O'Neal's back door into Saunders' voicemail box, would be an absurd result. The TCPA was created to limit the\n   harassment and nuisance that automated calls and messages place on consumers-which is precisely what Saunders alleges Dyck O'Neal has done. Dyck O'Neal cannot skirt the statute with VoApp's new technology.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Accordingly, Dyck O'Neal's direct-to-voicemail messages are a \"call\" under the TCPA, and Saunders' claim will proceed. To hold otherwise \"would elevate form over substance, thwart Congressional intent that evolving technologies not deprive mobile consumers of the TCPA's protections, and potentially open a floodgate of unwanted [voicemail] messages to wireless consumers.\" 30 F.C.C.

Therefore, Saunders requests that the Court permit her to remove Dyck O'Neal's use of its manual dialer from contention in this case. Saunders' request will be granted. Local Rule 7.1(d) requires that, \"[w]ith respect to all motions, the moving party shall ascertain whether the motion will be opposed.\" Dyck O'Neal apparently failed to consider Saunders' communication on this matter.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    Voicemail messages are not stored on individuals' physical phones, but rather in a data center often managed by the cellphone carrier.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    Dyck O'Neal argues that because voicemail is an \"information or enhanced service,\" as opposed to a \"telecommunications service,\" it is not regulated under \u00a7 227(b)(1)(A)(iii), according to\n    <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2064.702\">\n     47 C.F.R. \u00a7 64.702\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a).
