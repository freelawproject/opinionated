I find that\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   provides no remedy for Ms. Sieg's alleged constitutional violations and that no genuine issue of material fact exists about whether the reduction in work assignments related to the petition and whether Ms. Sieg improperly barred Ms Jangjoo from the BBG premises.

Compl. \u00b6 34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The parties disagree over how well Ms. Jangjoo performed in both of her roles at PNN. Nicholas Kalhor, an Executive Producer and Ms. Jangjoo's first-line supervisor, testified that he found her \"unwilling to perform the essential duties of her job,\" could not \"operate the chyron and teleprompter properly,\" was \"frequently insubordinate and unprofessional,\" and that her \"attendance was unreliable\" and she\n   \"consistently displayed a poor work ethic and an inability to take direction and constructive feedback.\" Mot. for Summ. J. Ex. 23 (\"Decl. of Nicholas Kalhor\") \u00b6\u00b6 6-7, ECF No. 35-5.

Ms. Jangjoo disputes these characterizations because \"there was a group of employees who wanted to get rid of [Ms.] Jangjoo at that time,\" and clarifies that Ms. Sieg denied the recommendation for probation and extended her contract for another year.

Def.'s SOMF \u00b6\u00b6 19-21; Opp. to Mot. for Summ. J. (\"Pl.'s Opp.\") Ex. 8 (\"Statement of Siamak Dehghanpour\") at 10, ECF No. 36-10. PNN claims that Mr. Dehghanpour refused at the last minute, despite orders from the Executive Editor and Ms. Sieg, to go on air to report on the breaking news of the Iranian nuclear deal. Def.'s SOMF \u00b6 19. PNN's impression was that the refusal related to not wanting to work with a would-be co-anchor.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20. Mr. Dehghanpour's version of events was that he wanted to proceed with his show as scripted (also about the Iran nuclear deal), and did not feel comfortable interrupting the scheduled line-up of speakers to deliver breaking news that had not yet been confirmed by the Associated Press or the White House.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Statement of Siamak Dehghanpour at 1, 5. With respect to the co-host, he stated that he had \"never co-hosted a show in the middle of a program on air\" and that \"there was no clear order nor a clear mission\" for him to follow.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8. Following this incident, Mr. Dehghanpour was removed from the air. Def.'s SOMF \u00b6 22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In summer 2015, a petition was posted on the website change.org to reinstate Mr. Dehghanpour. Def.'s SOMF \u00b6 24. Ms. Jangjoo signed the petition in July 2015.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25. On July 18, 2015, Ms. Sieg received an email with a link to the petition, but claims that she did not click on the link.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 26, 28. A search of Ms. Sieg's browsing history on her work a showed that she did not visit any change.org site in July or August 2015.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28. The facts that Ms. Jangjoo signed the petition and that Ms. Sieg received an email with a link to the petition, but did not check any change.org website from her work computer in July or August 2015, are all undisputed. Pl.'s Resp. to Def.'s SOMF \u00b6\u00b6 25-29. It is also undisputed that Ms. Sieg receives\n   around 300 emails a day and does not open all of them, and Ms. Jangjoo does not claim to have shown the petition to Ms. Sieg.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 27, 29.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    C. VOA's Ongoing Budgetary Difficulties and Ms. Jangjoo's Reduction of Work\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Concurrent to these events were VOA's budgetary difficulties. Ms. Sieg claims that in early 2015, she was instructed to begin identifying contracts to reduce or eliminate; by mid-May 2015, she was told that VOA would \"likely have to make some reductions in contractors due to budget cuts.\" Def.'s SOMF \u00b6\u00b6 31, 33-34. On July 22, 2015, it was again reiterated to Ms. Sieg by email that the \"VOA budget is tight this year\" and to \"ensure that you are only funding or purchasing items that are 'must haves' and not wish list items.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35. A memorandum circulated to prepare for an anticipated $1.5 million budgetary shortfall explained that PNN would have to reduce contractor costs by 30%, either by \"reducing the average number of days per month that each contractor can work from 18 to 11\" or by \"eliminating approximately 25 contract positions (out of 81).\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In September 2015, an analysis determined that reducing Ms. Jangjoo's assignments from 18 to 10 per month would enable the budget for her position to last until early February 2016, a few weeks before her contract was scheduled to end. Mot. for Summ. J. Ex. 15, ECF No. 35-4. PNN management also determined that Ms. Jangjoo's services could be cut to four hours a day since she only worked on a particular show. Def.'s SOMF \u00b6 42. Mr. Kalhor made both recommendations to Ms. Nixon based on Ms. Jangjoo's performance and PNN's \"reduced need for her services.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On November 10, 2015, Mr. Kalhor emailed Ms. Jangjoo that she would have 10 assignments totaling 80 hours that month. Mot. for Summ. J. Ex. 16. Two days later, Messrs. Kalhor and Adib told her in person that her assignments would only be for four hours a day.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 17. Mr. Adib reported to Ms. Sieg that Ms. Jangjoo's response was to \"[take] the conversations to a personal level\" and that she threatened to \"set herself on fire\" in front of the building.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Mr. Adib also wrote that Ms. Jangjoo thought \"this decision [was] on a personal level and some people including [Mr. Adib] have been planning to terminate her contract for a long time.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ms. Sieg forwarded Mr. Adib's email to Human Resources, the Office of Security, and the Office of Contracts.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Ms. Jangjoo's Removal and Bar from the Building\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On November 13, 2015, the Office of Security and the Insider Threat Manager interviewed Ms. Jangjoo and reported that she was \"still upset\" about her hours being reduced but that she claimed not to be serious about the earlier threat of self-immolation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 18. The Insider Threat Manager also reported that Ms. Jangjoo was transported to D.C. Psychiatric Services by the police for further evaluation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   While BBG asserts that they called the police after Ms. Jangjoo agreed to receive medical attention, Ms. Jangjoo claims that she only asked for assistance and not a medical evaluation. Def.'s SOMF \u00b6 63; Pl.'s Response to Def.'s SOMF \u00b6 63.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   After the incident, BBG's security team recommended that Ms. Jangjoo be barred from returning to the building, and a group representing Human Resources, Contracts, and Ms. Jangjoo's supervisors accepted this recommendation. Mot. for Summ. J. Ex. 27, ECF No. 35-5. The group also agreed that the remainder of\n   the funds on Ms. Jangjoo's contract would be paid to her and that her contract would be terminated.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp. Ex. 15, ECF No. 36-12 (email from Contract Specialist stating that no termination letter was executed). It is undisputed that Ms. Sieg did not participate in the meeting between Ms. Jangjoo and BBG's security team and that Ms. Sieg had no role in having Ms. Jangjoo escorted from the building or being barred from it afterwards. Def.'s SOMF \u00b6\u00b6 66-67.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Procedural History of this Lawsuit\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Ms. Jangjoo began this lawsuit in May 2016 and, with leave of court, filed an amended complaint in late August 2016.

The original lawsuit was brought by Ms. Jangjoo and another plaintiff against the BBG and Ms. Sieg.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   The Defendants moved to dismiss all claims except for two brought by Ms. Jangjoo against Ms. Sieg in her personal capacity, which another judge of this District granted. Mem. Op. 2, ECF No. 23. The two remaining claims are Ms. Jangjoo's First Amendment claim that Ms. Sieg infringed on her right to free speech by reducing Ms. Jangjoo's assignments in retaliation for signing the petition, and her Fifth Amendment claim that Ms. Sieg's \"prohibition of Plaintiff Jangjoo's entry into the BBG Headquarters violated her due process rights.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am.

Second, even if a\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   remedy existed, which it does not, Ms. Sieg is entitled to qualified immunity. Last, although these bases independently preclude review of the merits, there is no genuine issue of material fact that signing the petition led to the reduction of Ms. Jangjoo's work assignments or being barred from the BBG premises.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Ms. Jangjoo complains that the number and duration of her work assignments were reduced and seeks reinstatement to her previous schedule. Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 118, 141. As described above, however, she points to no evidence to show a genuine dispute of material fact about whether Ms. Sieg ordered these actions to occur. Thus, what is left is a dispute over the agency's decision-making about staffing, a core function within the discretion of the agency. This insight is supported by the terms of Ms. Jangjoo's contract, which all parties agree provided that her services be on an \"as needed\" basis and without guarantee to any minimum number of hours or assignments. Def.'s SOMF \u00b6 2, Pl.'s Resp. to Def.'s SOMF \u00b6 2. Creating a new remedy that would necessarily implicate the deliberative process of the agency in its work assignment decisions would impermissibly infringe on the agency's discretion to form and manage contracts and to make everyday staffing decisions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. for Summ.

For example, in this case alone, which was first started over two years ago, Compl. (May 9, 2016), ECF No. 1, the agency has filed two motions to dismiss (ECF Nos. 12, 15), addressed several discovery issues such a motion for a protective order from a third-party witness sought to be deposed by Ms. Jangjoo (ECF No. 29), successfully defended against a motion for sanctions (ECF No. 40), and briefed this motion for summary judgment (ECF No. 35). These considerations counsel against judicial intrusion into the staffing decisions of an agency within another co-equal branch of government.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Abbasi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604999\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1843/#p1854\">\n    137 S.Ct. at 1860-61\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Allowing a damages suit in this context, or in a like context in other circumstances, would require courts to interfere in an intrusive way with sensitive functions of the Executive Branch.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <em>\n    Third\n   </em>\n   , an alternative remedial structure exists through the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The APA permits individuals to bring a judicial challenge to agency action that is \"arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law\" and to be afforded equitable relief.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20702\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 702\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 706(2)(A).

In any event, the Court need not devote more attention to this question, because Ms. Jangjoo fails to identify evidence from which a reasonable jury could reasonably infer that Ms. Sieg was responsible for these decisions. Ms. Sieg is entitled to summary judgment on Ms. Jangjoo's Fifth Amendment claim as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    V. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   For all these reasons, the Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment will be granted. A separate order will issue.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    Unless noted otherwise, all citations in Section I. are to undisputed facts.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    Ms. Sieg argues that Ms. Jangjoo also could have pursued relief under the Contract Disputes Act (\"CDA\"),\n    <extracted-citation index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=41%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207101\">\n     41 U.S.C. \u00a7 7101\n    </extracted-citation>\n    <em>\n     et seq.\n    </em>\n    , which authorizes contractors to appeal a contracting officer's decision in federal court. Mot. for Summ. J. 15-17. Because the sum total of the parties' arguments on the CDA occupies only two full pages of their briefs,\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=41%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207101\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    , Pl.'s Opp. 14, and because I find that several factors counsel against creating a\n    <em>\n     Bivens\n    </em>\n    action, including that the APA is a comprehensive alternative remedial scheme, it is unnecessary to address the CDA.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    As Ms. Sieg points out, Ms. Jangjoo did not respond to any of the arguments advanced that there was no \"causal link\" between the speech and the adverse action. Reply in Supp. of Mot. for Summ. J. 10-11, ECF No. 37 (citing\n    <em>\n     Magliore v. Brooks\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3779494\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/844/38/#p43\">\n     844 F.Supp.2d 38\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 43 (D.D.C. 2012) (explaining that a party concedes an issue by failing to address or rebut the argument) ). The failure to respond is more than mere oversight, as Ms. Sieg's argument spanned many pages in her motion.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Mot. for Summ. J. 28-39.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    True, the Court previously characterized Ms. Jangjoo's complaint as \"at its core, a staffing dispute.\" See\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    Section III.B. But the staffing dispute referenced there was the reduction of Ms. Jangjoo's work assignments; the issue here is her signing an online petition seeking reinstatement of Mr. Dehghanpour to his hosting duties.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-91\">\n    Ms. Sieg argues that it does not matter that the petition \"garnered a substantial number of signatures.\" Mot. for Summ. J. 25. The Court agrees that whether speech is protected by the First Amendment should not be judged based on how much attention is paid to it. The more salient inquiry is the content of the speech-and here, the content is about who the public trusts to convey it information about the important political and cultural issues of the day.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    Ms. Jangjoo claims-with just a general citation of a deposition to support her assertion-that Ms. Sieg instructed an intermediary to relay a message to her in early August that Ms. Jangjoo's assignments were being reduced to 10 monthly, but also admits that \"the reduction didn't take place before November 10, 2015.\" Pl.'s Opp. 17-18. In addition to Ms. Jangjoo's admission, the uncontroverted record-Ms. Jangjoo's timesheets-also shows that she was paid for more than 80 hours of work in September and October 2015. Mot. for Summ. J. Ex. 29. The evidence does not support Ms. Jangjoo's contention that there was a short temporal proximity between her signing the petition and the reduction of her assignments.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pl.'s Opp. 17.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-93\">\n    I accordingly need not reach whether the alleged unlawfulness of the conduct was clearly established at the time.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    Before being removed from the premises for medical treatment, Ms. Jangjoo spoke with Special Agent Karan Wright and Tisha Elliott of Human Resources and admitted in English that she had threatened self-immolation in front of the building. Mot. for Summ. J. Ex. 21 (Decl. of Karan Wright) \u00b6\u00b6 8-9, ECF No. 35-5. Agent Wright testified that it is standard procedure for an individual making a threat in a United States Government building to be removed and barred from further entry.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 10. Ms. Elliott reported that because she became concerned about Ms. Jangjoo's mental state during the meeting, she asked Ms. Jangjoo if she could get assistance for her and she agreed. Mot. for Summ. J. Ex. 39 (Decl. of Tisha Elliott) 41:3-8. Ms. Elliott then called emergency services.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
