FRIEDMAN, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   During the final pretrial conference on July 23, 2018, plaintiff Rodney Bradshaw invoked his right under Rule 615 of the Federal Rules of Evidence to sequester witnesses at the bench trial that began yesterday, July 31, 2018. In response, defendant Sonny Perdue, Secretary of the United States Department of Agriculture (\"USDA\"), designated Dwight Jurey as its party representative pursuant to Rule 615(b). In the motion\n   <em>\n    in\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    limine\n   </em>\n   presently before the Court, Mr. Bradshaw moves to exclude Mr. Jurey from the courtroom for the duration of trial or, at a minimum, during Mr. Bradshaw's testimony.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff's Motion\n   <em>\n    in\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Limine\n   </em>\n   to Sequester Defense Party Representative Dwight Jurey (\"Mot.\") [Dkt. No. 232] and Memorandum of Law in Support (\"Mem.\") [Dkt. No. 232-1]. Defendant USDA opposes the motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defendant's Opposition to Motion (\"Opp'n\") [Dkt. No. 233]. Upon careful consideration of the parties' filings, the relevant legal authorities, and the entire record in this case, the Court granted the motion by separate Order [Dkt. No. 234] on July 30, 2018. This Memorandum Opinion explains the reasons for that Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Rule 615 of the Federal Rules of Evidence provides that, at the request of a party, the Court must order witnesses excluded so that they cannot hear the testimony of other witnesses. Rule 615(a) exempts a party who is a natural person from this directive. And Rule 615(b)\"does not authorize excluding ... an officer or employee of a party that is not a natural person, after being designated as the party's representative by its attorney.\" FED. R. EVID. 615(b). \"The sequestration rule serves two primary purposes: to prevent a witness from tailoring his testimony in light of the testimony of other witnesses, and to permit the discovery of false testimony and other problems relating to credibility.\"\n   <em>\n    Minebea Co., Ltd. v. Papst\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8966154\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/374/231/#p233\">\n    374 F.Supp.2d 231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 233 (D.D.C. 2005) ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Queen v.

Cir. 1988). As Judge Selya observed in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Sepulveda\n   </em>\n   , \"the sequestration process involves three parts: preventing prospective witnesses from consulting each other; preventing witnesses from hearing other witnesses testify; and preventing prospective witnesses from consulting witnesses who have already testified.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Sepulveda\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1527601\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/15/1161/#p1176\">\n    15 F.3d 1161\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1176 (1st Cir. 1993).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In his motion, Mr. Bradshaw does not contest Mr. Jurey's designation as defendant's party representative under Rule 615(b).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mem. at 1 n.1. Rather, Mr. Bradshaw contends that the Court may sequester Mr. Jurey notwithstanding this designation in order to ensure that Mr. Jurey \"cannot mold his testimony to respond to the testimony of the other critical witness in this case, Mr. Bradshaw.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1. Defendant responds that as defendant's designated party representative, Mr. Jurey is entitled to remain in the courtroom for the duration of the trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp'n at 3-4. Defendant further argues that because Mr. Jurey's expected testimony is clear from prior testimony and motion practice, it is unlikely that Mr. Bradshaw's testimony will color Mr. Jurey's testimony.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The question is whether Mr. Jurey - as defendant's designated party representative under Rule 615(b) -may properly be excluded from the courtroom during some or all of the trial proceedings. This appears to be an open question in this District. As Judge Kollar-Kotelly explained: \" Rule 615 does not bar the Court from excluding [party representatives]; it 'merely withholds authorization for the[ir] exclusion' .... This is a subtle difference that suggests the Court may still 'have discretion to exclude these individuals so long as that power derives from a source other than Rule 615, such as the court's general powers to manage the conduct of trial.' \"\n   <em>\n    United States ex rel.

This trial is about whom to believe, Mr. Bradshaw or Mr. Jurey. It is a \"he said-he said\" kind of case that turns largely on the credibility of these two witnesses recalling events that occurred over fifteen years ago. As the Court has previously explained, \"Mr. Bradshaw faces a formidable challenge in persuading [the factfinder] that Dwight Jurey has lied about not receiving Bradshaw's paperwork as a means of cloaking racial discrimination. This is particularly so given the evidence that Jurey appears to have worked diligently over several years to shepherd a number of Mr. Bradshaw's loan applications through the process.\"\n   <em>\n    Bradshaw v.
