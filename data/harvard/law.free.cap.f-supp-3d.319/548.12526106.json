The Grand Jury returned a two count indictment of Martin Gottesfeld (\"defendant\" or \"Gottesfeld\") for his alleged involvement in these attacks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Pending before the Court are (1) defendant's motion to suppress and its supplements (Docket Nos. 78, 128 and 166) and (2) the government's motion\n   <em>\n    in\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    limine\n   </em>\n   to preclude defendant's so-called \"torture defense\" (Docket No. 116). For the following reasons, the motion to suppress and their supplements will be denied and the motion\n   <em>\n    in\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    limine\n   </em>\n   will be allowed. By order of the Court entered on June 14, 2018 (Docket No. 205), the defendant's motions to dismiss (Docket No. 164) and for release from custody (Docket Nos. 147 and 177) were denied, with the notation that an explanatory memorandum would follow.

That year, he advocated for the shutdown of an adolescent treatment center in Utah (\"the Utah Treatment Center\") through various social media accounts. In November 2013, the Utah Treatment Center was the target of intermittent distributed denial of service (\"DDOS\") attacks for several months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   DDOS attacks flood computer servers with traffic in an attempt to overload the capacity of the server system. This generally involves directing traffic from remotely hijacked, web-enabled devices or access to high capacity internet connections through which thousands of traffic sources are simulated. The cyber attacks are difficult to defend against because they come from so many sources. In addition to exceeding the capacities of the servers, attacks often force victims to shut down important parts of their websites or to refuse otherwise legitimate and productive traffic.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In March 2014, the company that managed patient records for the Utah Treatment Center (\"the Record Management Company\") was also targeted with DDOS attacks. Gottesfeld allegedly used his Twitter account while the attacks were occurring to send a message to the Record Management Company: \"Website troubles? Drop [the Utah Treatment Center] or we NEVER stop\". For more than one month, the attacks disrupted the ability of the Records Management Company to communicate with clients and cost the company approximately $24,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In early 2014, the media began reporting on a teenager, Justina Pelletier (\"Ms. Pelletier\") who had been placed in the custody of the Massachusetts Department of Children and Families (\"DCF\") because of concerns that her parents were interfering with her treatment for a psycho-somatic disorder by instead insisting on treatment for mitochondrial disease. Ms. Pelletier was reportedly treated at BCH before being transferred to Wayside.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On March 23, 2014, Gottesfeld purportedly sent Twitter messages to an unindicted co-conspirator suggesting targeting Wayside with cyber-attacks. Two days later, Gottesfeld allegedly issued a series of public Twitter messages calling for attacks on the Wayside network. The attacks lasted more than a week, crippled Wayside's website and caused Wayside to spend in excess of $18,000 on response and mitigation efforts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Also March 23, 2014, Gottesfeld allegedly posted a YouTube video in the name of the hacking organization Anonymous calling for action against BCH. The video stated Anonymous' intent to punish BCH until Ms. Pelletier was released and demanded the termination of a physician involved in Ms. Pelletier's case \"or [BCH] too shall feel the full unbridled wrath of Anonymous\". The video directed viewers to a website that contained information necessary to initiate a DDOS attack against BCH's computer server.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On April 19, 2014, Gottesfeld and the alleged conspirators purportedly initiated a DDOS attack against BCH's Massachusetts server for at least seven days, taking BCH's website out of service. The attacks disrupted the entire BCH community by impeding the ability of physicians to communicate and access patient records. The cyber attack also occurred during a period of important fundraising which was severely impacted. Responding to and mitigating the damage from the attack purportedly cost BCH more than $300,000 in addition to lost fundraising estimated at $300,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Government's Motion\n    <em>\n     in\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Limine\n    </em>\n    to Preclude Defendant's \"Torture Defense\" Based on Necessity and Defense of Another (Docket No. 116)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The government moves to preclude evidence on the affirmative defenses of necessity\n   and defense of another that is not otherwise admissible for an appropriate purpose. The government contends that defendant cannot produce competent evidence to show that he acted in defense of Ms. Pelletier because (1) defendant was never in Ms. Pelletier's presence, (2) he cannot show that he acted to prevent imminent harm and (3) there is no evidence of unlawful force by BCH or Wayside. With respect to defendant's purported necessity defense, the government maintains that the defendant has proffered no competent evidence showing that (1) defendant's actions were in reasonable anticipation of averting the alleged harm or (2) defendant lacked legal alternatives to violating the law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Defendant first renews his objection to the motion\n   <em>\n    in\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    limine\n   </em>\n   procedure to exclude an affirmative defense. He maintains that requiring a proffer of evidence at this juncture shifts the burden of proof to him and compels self-incrimination by defendant. In support of the imminence-of-harm requirement, defendant proffers his statement to the Huffington Post describing the harm Ms. Pelletier faced in the care of BCH and Wayside. Defendant relies on interviews of Ms. Pelletier's father on television news programs describing Ms. Pelletier's condition. Defendant contends that he has demonstrated the imminent harm element by tendering evidence of Ms. Pelletier's ongoing medical suffering.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Defendant rejects the government's suggestion that the \"force\" used by BCH and Wayside was not unlawful because it was exerted pursuant to an order by the DCF. He objects to the premise that legally-sanctioned force cannot be unlawful because a state court order with respect to custody can later be overturned. Defendant relies again on news articles, suggesting that the court proceedings themselves may have been compromised.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Gottesfeld argues that it was reasonable to anticipate a direct, causal relationship between his action and the harm to be averted, proffering evidence that the cyber attack largely achieved the intended effect of raising awareness of Ms. Pelletier's story. He submits that after the attack, the state court judge dismissed the case and returned custody of Ms. Pelletier to her parents. Defendant contends that a juror could find that the non-traditional attack was necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   To demonstrate that defendant had no legal alternatives to the alleged cyber attack, he proffers evidence that Ms. Pelletier's parents had already notified the FBI and other law enforcement agencies. He contends that he had no standing to seek other legal relief on behalf of Ms. Pelletier and that writing Congress, engaging in public protest or sending private messages to those affected would not have been effective in redressing the ongoing harm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   While a defendant has a \"wide-ranging\" right to present a defense, that right is not absolute and does not include the right to present irrelevant evidence.\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Maxwell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11086967\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/254/21/#p26\">\n    254 F.3d 21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 26 (1st Cir. 2001) (citing\n   <em>\n    In re Oliver\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6157870\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/333/257/\">\n    333 U.S. 257\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 273-74 n.31,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6157870\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/333/257/\">\n    68 S.Ct. 499\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=92%20L.%20Ed.%20682\">\n    92 L.Ed. 682\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1948) ).

Defendant's subjective opinion that the force was unlawful does not make it so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   With respect to the necessity defense, defendant has not offered competent evidence that it was objectively reasonable to anticipate a causal relationship between the alleged cyber attack and the purported harm to be averted. Defendant has offered no competent evidence to demonstrate that he reasonably expected a DDOS interruption to lead to the release of Ms. Pelletier. In his opposition memorandum, he asserts that the disruption would \"certainly get the attention of the alleged abusers\", thereby improving Ms. Pelletier's chances for release. Gottesfeld acknowledges that he did not expect the attack would\n   <em>\n    cause\n   </em>\n   the desired effect, as is required, but rather that the attack would lead to publicity which could potentially improve the chances that Ms. Pelletier would get relief at some uncertain time in the future.\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Dorrell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"311823\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/758/427/#p434\">\n    758 F.2d at 434\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that defendant could not establish as a matter\n   of law that his spray-painting of government property could be reasonably anticipated to lead to the termination of a missile program and the aversion of nuclear war and world starvation).

In his opposition memorandum, he acknowledges some of those alternatives but complains of their ineffectiveness. For example, he maintains that Ms. Pelletier's parents had already called law enforcement and that public protest and writing a member of Congress \"cannot always be counted on to address a serious, ongoing harm\". Although such actions may not always be effective, defendant apparently concedes that legal alternatives did, in fact, exist.

The government also maintains that (1) pre-indictment motions to exclude are properly made on the Miscellaneous Business Docket, (2) it properly obtained effective consent from defendant's counsel, (3) there was no improper backdating and (4) the orders on the motions to exclude adopted the content of the assented-to motions thereby satisfying the reason-giving requirements of the Speedy Trial Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The Speedy Trial Act provides, in relevant part, that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   [a]ny information or indictment charging an individual with the commission of an offense shall be filed within thirty days from the date on which such individual was arrested.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203161\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

This Court declines to second guess the District Plan and its recognition of the importance of the secrecy of grand jury proceedings.

Validity of Consent from Predecessor Counsel\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   In addition to challenging the docket under which the motions to exclude time were filed, defendant contends that the motions were essentially made\n   <em>\n    ex\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    parte\n   </em>\n   because defendant's attorney, Tor Ekeland, was not authorized to assent thereto. Defendant avers that, because Attorney Ekeland was not a member of the Massachusetts Bar nor admitted to practice in the District in Case No. 16-mc-91064, he was not qualified to act as counsel and assent to any motion to exclude time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   In response, the government contends that defendant improperly conflates an attorney's authority to communicate (or enter into an agreement) with the government on behalf of a client with an attorney's obligation to file a motion to be admitted to practice before this Court. Attached to the government's opposition memorandum are communications between the government and Attorney Ekeland purporting to assent, on behalf of defendant, to the government filing of motions for excludable delay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   A review of those communications indicate that Attorney Ekeland's assent was valid. Under the local rules of this District, an attorney who is a member of the bar of another United States District Court or the highest court of any state \"may appear and practice in this court in a particular case by leave granted in the discretion of the Court\".\n   <em>\n    Local Rules of the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts\n   </em>\n   , Rule 83.5.3.

The assent given to the government to file a motion for excludable delay did not amount to \"practice before the Court\" under Massachusetts Local Rule 85.5.3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Alleged Backdating\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Defendant further challenges the exclusions on the grounds that the orders purported to exclude time through improper backdating on two occasions: (1) the second motion to exclude time, filed on April 11, 2016, purported to exclude time from April 22, 2016 through May 27, 2016, but was not granted until May 5, 2016 and (2) the fifth motion to exclude time, filed on July 26, 2016, purported to exclude time from August 1, 2016 through September 9, 2016 but was not granted until August 2, 2016. Defendant contends that 14 days were improperly backdated which, when added to the additional unexcluded days, puts the total at over 30 days.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The Speedy Trial Act provides that any delay resulting from the filing of a pretrial motion \"through the conclusion of the hearing on, or other prompt disposition of, such motion\" shall be excluded.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203161\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (h)(1)(D). The time between the filing of the motions and the resolution of those motions is properly excluded under that subsection and the orders of the district\n   judge did not therefore improperly allow retroactive exclusions of time. The cases relied on by defendant are inapposite. In\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Janik\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1914327\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/723/537/#p545\">\n    723 F.2d 537\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 545-46 (7th Cir. 1983), for example, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals reversed a district court's order denying a defendant's motion to dismiss where the district judge had retroactively declared an ends-of-justice continuance to exclude time that had elapsed during a period of time in excess of 60 days that the court had a motion to suppress under advisement. In denying a motion to dismiss, the district judge retroactively declared that the time should have been excluded even though there had been no motion to exclude filed during the pendency of the suppression motion.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1914327\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/723/537/#p545\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Here, the government had properly filed motions, with defendant's assent, to exclude time and those motions were allowed after the period the parties sought to exclude had begun to run.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Adoption of Content of Motions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Defendant objects that the orders excluding time are also invalid because they fail to set forth the reasons for finding that the ends of justice would be served by the granting of the requested continuances. The electronic endorsements of the assented-to motions, defendant avers, do not adequately explain their reasoning as is required by statute. The government responds that the electronic endorsements adopted the reasoning set forth in the motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203161\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (h)(7)(A), a Court may grant a motion for a continuance based on findings that \"the ends of justice served by taking such action outweigh the best interest\" of the defendant and public in a speedy trial.

With respect to the first motion, defendant was being transported from Florida to this District, necessitating additional time to allow parties to discuss a plea. The third, fourth and fifth motions make clear that the parties agreed to wait for the detention decision of the magistrate judge before resuming plea negotiations.

With respect to her purported involvement in TBF, the affidavit of Mr. Gassert submitted by the government makes clear that Magistrate Judge Bowler had no involvement in the organization at the time the warrant was issued. Accordingly, that ground for recusal is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Defendant also contests Magistrate Judge Bowler's neutrality because of her spousal relationship with Dr. Marc A. Pfeffer, a professor of medicine at HMS and a senior cardiologist at Brigham and Women's Hospital (\"the Brigham\"). Defendant suggests that recusal was required because the affidavit in support of the search warrant referred to\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   disruptions to the BCH website and additional disruption to the network on which BCH and other\n   <em>\n    Harvard\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    University-affiliated\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    hospitals\n   </em>\n   communicate.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   (emphasis added). He concludes that the reference to \"Harvard University-affiliated hospitals\" gave Dr. Pfeffer a financial interest in the subject of the warrant. Defendant's attempt to amalgamate distinct legal entities does not create a financial interest where that interest does not exist. The government convincingly demonstrates that HMS is not an affiliate of area hospitals in the sense that there is a business relationship with the hallmarks of legal control, but rather that the affiliation relates to the training of medical students and residents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Furthermore, under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20455\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(4), an organizational victim of a crime is not a \"party to the proceeding\" such that a financial interest in that victim would require recusal.\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Rogers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"199825\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/119/1377/#p1384\">\n    119 F.3d 1377\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1384 (9th Cir. 1997) ;\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Lauersen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9064176\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/348/329/#p336\">\n    348 F.3d 329\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 336 (2d Cir. 2003) (declining to adopt\n   <em>\n    per\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    se\n   </em>\n   rule requiring recusal in every case where judge has interest in victim of a crime). Accordingly, even if Dr. Pfeffer had a financial interest in one of alleged victims of this case, BCH or Wayside, by virtue of his relationship to HMS and the Brigham (which it is clear he does not), that interest would not require disqualification here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Defendant grasps at other potential interests in an attempt to manufacture a rationale requiring recusal. For instance, he notes that Dr. Pfeffer is on the faculty of the Brigham's \"Division of Medical Communications\", and infers from that title that his work would suffer from a disruption to the network on which BCH and Harvard-affiliated hospitals communicate. The government responds that the Division of Medical Communications focuses on physician communication skills and that defendant has offered no evidence that a cyber attack on a computer network seriously implicates Dr. Pfeffer's work in any way. This Court agrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   As noted at a May 3, 2018 hearing on an unrelated motion, Magistrate Judge Bowler's recusal in\n   <em>\n    Cabi\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Boston Children's\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hospital\n   </em>\n   , Case No. 15-cv-12306, is inapposite. In that case, Magistrate Judge Bowler was assigned to the case for nearly two years during which time she considered and decided a number of pending discovery motions and held seven hearings on those pending motions. Only after HMS became directly involved in the case did Magistrate Judge Bowler recuse herself from the case with the following comment:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   As discovery has progressed, it has become apparent that the connection of this action to the Harvard Medical School is more direct than originally anticipated.

This Court declines to accept defendant's invitation to depart from the growing consensus that the collection of IP address information similar to the information collected here does not violate a defendant's Fourth Amendment rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Defendant also contends that the IP addresses themselves constitute the content of his communications and that, therefore, the seizure of the information violated his Fourth Amendment rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   The United States Supreme Court has set out a two-part test to determine whether a person has a legitimate expectation of privacy in the place searched or the item seized: (1) whether the movant has exhibited an actual, subjective expectation of privacy and (2) whether that subjective expectation is \"one that society is prepared to recognize as objectively reasonable\".\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Maryland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1532082\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/442/735/#p743\">\n    442 U.S. 735\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 740,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1532082\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/442/735/#p743\">\n    99 S.Ct. 2577\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1532082\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/442/735/#p743\">\n    61 L.Ed.2d 220\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1979) (citing\n   <em>\n    Katz\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11339173\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/389/347/\">\n    389 U.S. 347\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11339173\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/389/347/\">\n    88 S.Ct. 507\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11339173\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/389/347/\">\n    19 L.Ed.2d 576\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1967) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Defendant contends that he had a reasonable expectation of privacy and that he demonstrated his subjective expectation by using encryption services. Even if defendant demonstrates that he has a subjective expectation of privacy in the IP addresses, however, he cannot meet his burden with respect to the second part of the test. The recording of IP address information and similar routing data \"are precisely analogous to the capture of telephone numbers at issue in\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   \" and, therefore, defendant cannot show that \"a reasonable person could maintain a privacy interest in that sort of information\".\n   <em>\n    Ulbricht\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276296\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/858/71/#p97\">\n    858 F.3d 71\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 97.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Defendant's statutory claim that the collection of IP addresses and port numbers constitutes \"content\" also falls short.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Forrester\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4069126\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/512/500/#p510\">\n    512 F.3d at 510\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that collection of IP address, constituting address information, \"do not necessarily reveal any more about the underlying contents of communication than do phone numbers\");\n   <em>\n    Ulbricht\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276296\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/858/71/#p97\">\n    858 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   98 n.29 (making clear that holding is limited to capture of IP addresses and Transmission Control Protocol (\"TCP\") connection data and does not include \"more invasive surveillance techniques that capture more information (such as content)\").

Accordingly, all three motions to suppress will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   <strong>\n    V. Defendant's Motions for Release from Custody (Docket Nos. 147 and 177)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   In conjunction with his motion to dismiss, defendant filed two motions for release from custody seeking review, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203145\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3145\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) of the order of detention entered by the magistrate judge assigned to this case on July 27, 2016. Defendant moves for revocation of that detention order because of the likelihood that he will prevail on his motions to suppress and to dismiss. As explained above, the Court will deny those motions and therefore finds no grounds to revoke the detention order here. After review of the record, the Court finds that the government has demonstrated, by a preponderance of evidence, that defendant constitutes a serious risk of flight under 18 U.S.C. 3142(f)(2)(A). As stated in the order of the Court entered June 14, 2018 (Docket No. 205), the motions for release from custody are denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     ORDER\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, defendant's motions to suppress (Docket Nos. 78, 128 and 166) are\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   and the government's motion\n   <em>\n    in\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    limine\n   </em>\n   (Docket No. 116) is\n   <strong>\n    ALLOWED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   As noted in the foregoing memorandum, defendant's motions to dismiss (Docket No. 164) and for release from custody (Docket Nos. 147 and 177) were previously denied by order of the Court entered June 14, 2018 (Docket No. 205).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   <strong>\n    So ordered.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-121\">\n    In his reply memorandum in support of his second supplemental motion to suppress, defendant requests leave \"to address additional issues, if not in writing, than [sic] at the scheduled hearing on the matter\". At the June 13, 2018 motion hearing, this Court granted leave to Attorney Grimaldi to address additional issues orally at the hearing provided that he did so within the time restrictions imposed for oral argument. In at least one post-hearing pleading, Attorney Grimaldi implies that the Court granted him leave to file a \"supplemental brief concerning suppression\". That is incorrect. Defendant has, to date, submitted in excess of 70 pages in support of his motion to suppress which is deemed sufficient.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
