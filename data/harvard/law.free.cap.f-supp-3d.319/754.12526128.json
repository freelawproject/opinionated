(\"Kangaroo\")'s alleged copyright infringement of a banana costume made and copyrighted by Plaintiff Silvertop Associates, Inc., doing business as Rasta Imposta (\"Rasta Imposta\"). Before the Court is Rasta Imposta's Motion for Preliminary Injunction and Kangaroo's Cross-Motion to Dismiss. For the reasons that follow, the Court will grant Rasta Imposta's Motion for Preliminary Injunction, grant Kangaroo's Cross-Motion to Dismiss as to Count III of the Complaint, and deny Kangaroo's Cross-Motion to Dismiss as to Count I and Count II of the Complaint. The Court will require a $100,000 bond be posted by Rasta Imposta to maintain the preliminary injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Court takes the following facts from Robert Berman's Declaration in support of Rasta Imposta's Motion for Preliminary\n   Injunction and from his testimony at a hearing before the Court. Berman is the Chief Executive Officer of Rasta Imposta, a business that designs, manufactures, and sells costumes for adults and children. Among these costumes, Rasta Imposta began to offer a banana design on March 9, 2011 (\"the Banana Costume\"). While Rasta Imposta has licensed the Banana Costume to third parties, Kangaroo does not have a license for the Banana Costume. On March 23, 2010, Rasta Imposta filed a copyright application to register the Banana Costume. Copyright Registration No. VA 1-707-439 was issued by the United States Copyright Office on March 26, 2010 for the Banana Costume.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In 2012, Rasta Imposta entered into a business relationship with Yagoozon, Inc. (\"Yagoozon\"), founded by Justin Ligeri. This relationship was formed for Yagoozon to sell Rasta Imposta's Banana Costume. Over the course of the business relationship, Ligeri was informed of Rasta Imposta's copyright registration for the Banana Costume, and Yagoozon purchased thousands of them from Rasta Imposta. The business relationship eventually ended. Ligeri is also the founder of Kangaroo. Around September 25, 2017, Berman discovered Kangaroo was selling a costume that resembled the Banana Costume at issue in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Rasta Imposta filed its Complaint with the Court on October 5, 2017, bringing claims for copyright infringement (Count I), trade dress infringement (Count II), and unfair competition (Count III). On October 19, 2017, the parties entered into a Stipulation of Standstill Period whereby, in anticipation of \"discuss[ing] an amicable resolution to this matter prior to December 1, 2017,\" the parties agreed that Kangaroo would \"cease manufacturing, ordering, offering for sale, advertising, marketing, promoting, selling and distributing Plaintiff's Banana Design (and any substantially similar Banana costume) until December 1, 2017.\" It further stipulated that \"if this case is not settled or otherwise resolved prior to December 1, 2017, Plaintiff will file its application for a preliminary injunction on or about December 1, 2017.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Settlement discussions were not successful and on December 1, 2017, Rasta Imposta filed a Motion for Preliminary Injunction. Kangaroo responded with a December 21, 2017 Cross-Motion to Dismiss. This Court held a hearing on the pending motions on January 26, 2018, which was continued on February 13, 2018. Rasta Imposta presented the testimony of Berman, who was cross-examined by Kangaroo, and who testified consistently with his declaration. The parties submitted supplemental briefing following the hearing, which was complete as of March 8, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201331\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 1338(a). In Kangaroo's Cross-Motion to Dismiss, Kangaroo argues it is not subject to personal jurisdiction in New Jersey. This issue was addressed at the hearing before the Court and in the supplemental briefing. In its March 2, 2018 letter brief, Kangaroo \"decided to withdraw its jurisdictional objection\" and \"to consent to personal jurisdiction in this proceeding.\" Accordingly, the Court has personal jurisdiction, by consent, over Kangaroo.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Azubuko v.

Kangaroo argues Rasta Imposta is seeking \"a mandatory injunction seeking the ultimate relief requested should it win the case,\" which Kangaroo argues would require the Court to apply a heightened burden on Rasta Imposta. Rasta Imposta, however, argues Kangaroo \"mistakenly alleged\" that it is seeking a mandatory injunction and maintains that it \"is only seeking a preliminary injunction at this stage.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Court finds that the question of whether Rasta Imposta is asking for a mandatory injunction or not depends not on the wording of the motion and the moving papers, but on the substance of the relief being requested. Accordingly, the language Rasta Imposta chose in framing its request does not resolve this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \"An injunction is mandatory if the injunction will either (1) 'alter the status quo by commanding some positive act' or (2) provide the moving party with 'substantially all the relief sought and that relief cannot be undone even if the defendant prevails at a trial on the merits.' \"\n   <em>\n    Coast to Coast Entm't, LLC v.

Rasta Imposta's Complaint pleads it \"is entitled pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20504\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 504\n   </extracted-citation>\n   to either disgorgement of profits and recovery of actual damages, or statutory damages\" under its copyright claim. Rasta Imposta further pleads an entitlement to attorneys' fees and costs pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20505\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Similarly, under its trade dress infringement claim, Rasta Imposta pleads it \"is\n   entitled to recover their damages, as well as Kangaroo's profits received as a result of the infringement, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201117\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1117\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\" Second, the Court does not find the injunctive relief \"cannot be later undone.\" If later shown to be warranted, the injunction can be lifted and the $100,000 bond will be used to make Kangaroo whole. The Court does not consider this to be a motion for a mandatory injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Reasonable Probability of Success on the Merits\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Court begins by considering the reasonable probability of success on the merits of Rasta Imposta's copyright infringement claim. \"To establish infringement, two elements must be proven: (1) ownership of a valid copyright, and (2) copying of constituent elements of the work that are original.\"\n   <em>\n    Feist Publ'ns, Inc. v.

The evidentiary weight to be accorded the certificate of a registration made thereafter shall be within the discretion of the court.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Certificate of Registration Rasta Imposta presents to the Court lists an \"effective date of registration\" of March 26, 2010. However, it lists the date of first publication as March 9, 2001-well over five years before the registration date. The Court thus finds there is no presumption of validity in this case due to the registration of the Banana Costume over nine years after its first publication. Nonetheless, the Court considers the existence of this registration in its analysis of the validity of the copyright.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Court begins by considering whether the Banana Costume is a useful article.

First, the existence of the Certificate of Registration, even if registered over nine years after the date of first publication, is persuasive evidence to this Court. Further, the Court finds a likelihood that Rasta Imposta can prove that the banana design can both be identified separately from and can exist independently from the utilitarian aspect of the article. The Court can easily identify the features of the Banana Costume having a pictorial, graphic, or sculptural quality.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   These features include: a) the overall length of the costume, b) the overall shape of the design in terms of curvature, c) the length of the shape both above and below the torso of the wearer, d) the shape, size,\n   and jet black color of both ends, e) the location of the head and arm cutouts which dictate how the costume drapes on and protrudes from a wearer (as opposed to the mere existence of the cutout holes), f) the soft, smooth, almost shiny look and feel of the chosen synthetic fabric, g) the parallel lines which mimic the ridges on a banana in three-dimensional form, and h) the bright shade of a golden yellow and uniform color that appears distinct from the more muted and inconsistent tones of a natural banana.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The Court finds that, if these features were separated from the costume itself and applied on a painter's canvas, it would qualify as a two-dimensional work of art in a way that would not replicate the costume itself.

In fact, the contrary appears to be true.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Rasta Imposta provides this Court with twenty-one banana costumes available in the marketplace that are easily distinguished from Rasta Imposta's design, which suggests that the limited number of options requirement necessary for merger to apply is absent. (Arena Decl. Ex. A). The Court has reviewed this submission and notes several unique ways of designing a banana costume.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The shape and curvature can vary, as can the existence and color of tips to the banana. Bananas can also be designed to appear ripe, overripe, or unripe, ranging in color from yellow, to brown, to green. The shape can be long or more stout, relatively elongated or thin or more plump. The banana may be whole or partially peeled. There can also be the production of vertical lines and the texture and material can differ.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   In contrast, it appears to the Court that almost every feature of Kangaroo's design resembles Rasta Imposta's. Rasta Imposta argues \"[a] side-by-side comparison of the costumes at issue is sufficient circumstantial evidence from which to infer copying.\" The Court agrees and finds Rasta Imposta has shown a reasonable likelihood of proving \"near identity\" of the costumes and that the copyright relates to protectable material.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The Court notes that the two deluxe costumes are both yellow in color and almost identically so, with Kangaroo's costume having a slightly more golden hue. However, both have black tips at both ends appearing to be roughly the same size and exactly the same color. Both have a near identical curvature with lines of the same yellow shade running vertically in roughly the same locations.

Kangaroo appears to base this amount on the allegation that \"defendant did $102,000 of sales of the banana costume in 2017 and would risk the loss of sales for the 2018 and 2019 seasons if the preliminary injunction were wrongfully issued.\" Based on this allegation, it appears to the Court that lost sales for 2018 and 2019 would be projected to be around $204,000. Kangaroo does not explain to the Court why almost $100,000 more than that figure should be posted by Rasta Imposta and why that amount should not be discounted to account for the difference between gross sales and lost profits. Kangaroo's loss of gross sales would not be the true measure of harm if the injunction is dissolved.

It seems safe to posit that there is no universal view of what a banana costume is or what it should look like.
