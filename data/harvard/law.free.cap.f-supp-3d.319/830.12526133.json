DAVIS, District Judge.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This matter is before the Court on a second motion for partial summary judgment filed by Prison Legal News, a project of the Human Rights Defense Center, (\"Plaintiff,\" or \"PLN\"), ECF No. 77, as well as a reserved issue in Plaintiff's original motion for partial summary judgment, ECF No. 35. Also pending is a previously reserved portion of a cross motion for summary judgment filed collectively by Ken Stolle, Sheriff for Virginia Beach, Virginia (\"the Sheriff\"), and the eight named defendant employees of the Virginia Beach Sheriff's Office (collectively with the Sheriff, \"Defendants\"). ECF No. 49. On December 8, 2014, this Court issued a detailed Opinion and Order resolving the majority of the parties' initial cross motions for summary judgment, but reserved ruling on the parties' dispute related to the constitutionality of the \"sexually explicit materials\" policy adopted by the Sheriff and implemented by Defendants at the Virginia Beach Correctional Center (\"VBCC\"). The Court having now received additional briefing on the reserved issue, and having conducted an on-the-record conference call with the parties on March 17, 2015, the prior motions on the sexually explicit materials policy, as well as Plaintiffs' more recently filed motion seeking summary judgment on a due process claim, are ripe for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This Court previously outlined the relevant factual and procedural background in detail in its December 8, 2014 Opinion and Order, and such background is incorporated by reference herein. In short, PLN is the publisher of a monthly magazine titled \"\n   <em>\n    Prison Legal News,\n   </em>\n   \" which is marketed mainly to inmates. Over the past several years, inmates at VBCC, which is operated by Sheriff Stolle and the Virginia Beach Sheriff's Office (\"VBSO\"), have not been permitted to receive the monthly\n   <em>\n    Prison Legal News\n   </em>\n   magazine. This Court's prior Opinion upheld the constitutionality of Defendants'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   decision not to allow past issues of such magazine into the VBCC based on the VBSO ban on all incoming publications that contain \"ordering forms\" with prices. The Court reserved ruling on the alternative reason for rejection of past issues of\n   <em>\n    Prison Legal News\n   </em>\n   based on various non-explicit, but arguably \"sexually suggestive,\" advertisements contained therein, with such ads displaying varying degrees of sexually suggestive photographs across different issues of\n   <em>\n    Prison Legal News.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Subsequent to this Court's December 2014 Opinion, both parties filed supplemental briefs regarding the constitutionality of the VBSO sexually explicit materials policy, and the briefs address whether such legal issue is moot in light of either: (1) this Court's prior ruling on the ordering form policy; and/or (2) the VBSO's recent adoption of a new sexually explicit materials policy. Additionally, PLN requested, and was granted, leave no file a second motion seeking partial summary judgment, the second motion focusing on PLN's allegations that the VBSO's notice and review policy associated with censoring incoming publications (hereinafter \"publication review policy\") was unconstitutional as it failed to provide publishers with adequate notice and/or an adequate opportunity to be heard when the VBSO prohibited a certain publication from entering the VBCC. Notably, while the instant action was pending, the VBSO has\n   <em>\n    twice\n   </em>\n   amended its publication review policy, with both voluntary changes occurring prior to this Court's issuance of its December 8, 2014 Opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Notwithstanding the fact that compensatory damages are no longer at issue in this case, and the fact that Defendants have modified, and unquestionably improved from a constitutional standpoint, both the VBSO sexually explicit materials policy and the VBSO publication review policy, as confirmed during the March 17, 2015 conference call, the parties are unable to resolve their disputes as to the now-abandoned policies. This Court therefore now proceeds to resolving the pending motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Additionally, as noted above, the VBSO adopted a new sexually explicit materials policy after this Court issued its prior Opinion, and Defendants therefore argue that the adoption of such new policy constitutes separate grounds for finding this issue to be moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Having carefully considered the parties' supplemental filings, the Court finds that Defendants, the parties asserting mootness, have failed to demonstrate either that this Court's prior ruling, or the VBSO's adoption of new sexually explicit materials and publication review policies, have mooted the disputes remaining in this case. As to the change in policies, which is the primary focus of the parties' briefs, Defendants have failed to demonstrate that, subsequent to the termination of this litigation, they will not re-implement the challenged policies. Notably, as recently explained by the Fourth Circuit:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   It is well established that a defendant's \"voluntary cessation of a challenged practice\" moots an action only if \"subsequent events made it absolutely clear that the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur.\"\n   <em>\n    Friends of the Earth, Inc. v.

In light of the fact that it is undisputed that Defendants were not sending \"Mail Restriction Forms\" to PLN during this time period, the email corroborates the fact that Defendants were taking no steps between May and August of 2012\n   <em>\n    to notify\n   </em>\n   PLN either of Defendants' decision to deny delivery to inmate subscribers, but retain in VBCC, the May 2012, June 2012, and July 2012 issues of\n   <em>\n    Prison Legal News\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    the basis for\n   </em>\n   Defendants' individualized decisions to censor such issues. Additionally, because the April 2012 \"Mail Restriction Form\" did not include any page numbers or other descriptions that specifically identified the allegedly offending material in the banned issue, such form did not provide PLN adequate notice that future issues of its monthly publication would also be barred from the VBCC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Viewing the facts in Defendants' favor for the purposes of resolving PLN's summary judgment motion, it appears that communications between Defendants and PLN in mid-August of 2012 retroactively put PLN on notice that monthly issues of\n   <em>\n    Prison Legal News\n   </em>\n   had been barred from VBCC the last several months. However, even assuming, without deciding, that the August communications were sufficient to put PLN on notice that the VBSO would continue to ban future issues of\n   <em>\n    Prison Legal News\n   </em>\n   if they contained similar content, there is still no evidence that PLN was at that time informed of its right to participate in a review of\n   <em>\n    the past censorship decisions.\n   </em>\n   Therefore, even viewing the facts in Defendants' favor, PLN has demonstrated that Defendants, at least for a short time, failed to satisfy the requirements of\n   <em>\n    Montcalm Publ'g\n   </em>\n   by providing PLN, a publisher, adequate notice that its monthly magazine was being banned during the summer of 2012 and adequate notice of how PLN could challenge such censorship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   As noted in this Court's prior order, the fact that PLN may have suspected,\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   or may have actually been aware, that such issues were being rejected based on communications from inmates to PLN appears largely irrelevant because \"while [an] inmate is free to notify the publisher [of censorship] and ask for help in challenging the prison authorities' decision, the publisher's First Amendment right must not depend on that.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Montcalm Publ'g,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7632800\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/80/105/#p109\">\n    80 F.3d at 109\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   To better illustrate the above finding, the Court turns to a case relied on by Defendants for the proposition that \"notice\" is not required each and every time a censorship decision is made by jail authorities.\n   <em>\n    Prison Legal News v.

Moreover, there is no evidence in the instant record suggesting that Defendants ever provided PLN with notice of \"when, where, and how\" they could be heard as to the individualized decisions rejecting PLN's May 2012, June 2012, and July 2012 monthly magazines before such censorship decisions became final.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Accordingly, the Court finds that disputed facts need not be resolved in order to determine that, at least for a short time, Defendants failed to provide adequate notice to PLN that its monthly magazine was being censored.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   As to an \"opportunity to be heard,\" there is no evidence before the Court suggesting that PLN was ever provided an opportunity to challenge the censorship of its May 2012, June 2012, or July 2012, issues of\n   <em>\n    Prison Legal News.

Accordingly, as to those months, PLN has demonstrated both inadequate notice and the associated failure to provide an opportunity to be heard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Moreover, even if the evidence demonstrated that PLN did receive adequate notice and an adequate opportunity to be heard (which it never invoked) as to the May 2012 through August 2012 timeframe, the record clearly demonstrates that in late 2013, Defendants provided a deficient review process that wholly undercut any meaningfulness of the review of a prior censorship decision, effectively denying PLN the right to be heard. Specifically, in October of 2013, after PLN filed suit, Defendants began providing PLN with notice\n   <em>\n    each month\n   </em>\n   indicating that the monthly\n   issue of\n   <em>\n    Prison Legal News\n   </em>\n   had been barred from the VBCC. PLN then began utilizing the review procedure set forth on the notice form, and each time PLN was heard on a censorship decision, the decision to prohibit the challenged issue was upheld. However, it is undisputed that, at least for a period of time, the VBSO was\n   <em>\n    not retaining a copy\n   </em>\n   of the censored\n   <em>\n    Prison Legal News\n   </em>\n   publication. Accordingly, the undisputed facts demonstrate that the VBSO \"review\" procedure was not a review to see if the censored content actually-violated VBSO policies, but was instead merely a review to make sure that the VBSO \"Mail Restriction Form\" was properly filled out. Stated differently, the entire review process consisted of a second set of eyes reviewing a copy of the \"Mail Restriction Form\" to see if the person who had completed such form\n   <em>\n    claimed\n   </em>\n   that there was a basis for censorship. It is readily apparent that such review procedure deprived PLN of a meaningful opportunity to be heard.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jordan,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5876780\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/577/1162/#p1172\">\n    577 F.Supp.2d at 1172-73\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (awarding declaratory and injunctive relief in the plaintiff's favor based on the finding that the disputed BOP \"Program Statement\" was unconstitutional \"to the extent it permits the institution to return the publication rejected [for containing nudity] ... to the publisher\n   <em>\n    prior to completion of the administrative review\n   </em>\n   \") (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Similar to the VBSO's sexually explicit materials policy, the apparent infirmities with the VBSO publication review policy that came to light during the pendency of this case were swiftly rectified by the Sheriff, and he should be commended for his actions of twice amending the VBSO notice and review procedure.

Defendants' briefs, however, fail to demonstrate that this Court's prior ruling renders such issue moot. Moreover, even if the \"as applied\" challenge were deemed moot, as described above, in light of the Sheriff's failure to acknowledge under oath that he is prohibited from returning to the prior sexually explicit materials policy on constitutional grounds, the facial challenge to such policy would plainly remain a live controversy.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    Although the implementing regulation limits the Ensign Amendment to\n    <em>\n     pictures\n    </em>\n    that are sexually explicit or contain nudity, a separate BOP regulation can be invoked to exclude a sexually explicit\n    <em>\n     writing\n    </em>\n    that \"by its nature or content poses a threat to the security, good order, or discipline of the institution, or facilitates criminal activity.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20540.71\">\n     28 C.F.R. \u00a7 540.71\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (b)(7) ;\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Jordan,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3825534\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/654/1012/#p1016\">\n     654 F.3d at 1017\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-93\">\n    The federal BOP program statement was not expressly relied on by the parties to this case.

Such newly enacted law provides that the DOC Board of Directors and the DOC Director have the power and duty to adopt, promulgate, and enforce \"regulations prohibiting the possession of obscene materials, as defined and described in Article 5 (\u00a7 18.2-372 et. seq.) of Chapter 8 of Title 18.2, by prisoners incarcerated in state correctional facilities.\" Va.

Stolle Aff. \u00b6 8, ECF No. 48-3. As suggested in this Court's prior Opinion, if such deliveries were occurring between April 2012 and October of 2013, such fact undercuts Defendants' assertion that PLN was \"on notice\" that its magazine was being consistently censored. However, even assuming that no \"outside of policy\" deliveries were made between April 2012 and October of 2013, it is undisputed that Defendants' individualized censorship decisions during this time period were not communicated\n    <em>\n     by Defendants\n    </em>\n    to PLN, as the Sheriff acknowledges that, rather than returning a \"seized\" mail item to the sender with a notice of rejection, on some occasions prior to the filing of this lawsuit, \"the pink copy of the Mail Restriction Form, designated to the sender, was placed with the seized item in the inmate's property box awaiting return to the inmate upon release, rather than being sent to the sender.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 21.

Even assuming that one or more of the May, June, or July 2012 issues were returned to PLN through such postal process, it is undisputed that Defendants were holding other copies of PLN's magazine in inmate's property boxes during that time period\n    <em>\n     without giving notice\n    </em>\n    to PLN that such magazines were not being delivered. ECF No. 81-2;\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    ECF No. 48-14. Accordingly, buttressed by the fact that VBCC is a city jail with a transitory population, an item marked \"Return to Sender\" received subsequent to a single notice that Defendants censored a single copy of a single edition of\n    <em>\n     Prison Legal News\n    </em>\n    is insufficient to put PLN on notice either that Defendants made a jail-wide decision to stop delivering all issues of\n    <em>\n     Prison Legal News\n    </em>\n    or to inform PLN how it could challenge such decision.

Subsequently, in April of 2014, a \"VBSO Policy and Procedure General Order\" was modified in order to clarify that \"seized mail items are to be retained for 30 days to allow for their review in the event of a challenge to the seizure.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 25;\n    <em>\n     see id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 24 (setting forth the language of the current policy which provides: (1) notice to both the sender and the inmate; (2) the reason for the seizure will be offered; (3) a 30 day appeal period will follow during which both \"[t]he inmate and sender are allowed the opportunity to challenge the seizure\"; (4) the review of a seizure will be provided by an individual that did not make the initial decision and who has authority to overturn such decision; and (5) that\n    <em>\n     after the review period,\n    </em>\n    the seized item will be stored, returned to sender, or destroyed).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"22\">\n   <p id=\"p-114\">\n    As in the previous section of this Opinion analyzing the former VBSO sexually explicit materials policy, the Court finds that PLN has carried its burden to demonstrate that an injunction is proper under the four-part test articulated by the Supreme Court in\n    <em>\n     eBay,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3276206\" index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/388/#p391\">\n     547 U.S. at 391\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3276206\" index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/388/#p391\">\n     126 S.Ct. 1837\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"23\">\n   <p id=\"p-115\">\n    The Amended Complaint requests an injunction requiring that rejection notices specifically identify both the page numbers of objectionable material as well as the penological justification claimed to be threatened by such material. ECF No. 17. PLN, however, failed to demonstrate that\n    <em>\n     when it did receive notice\n    </em>\n    of censorship decisions from Defendants, such notice lacked sufficient particularity to allow for a meaningful right to be heard as to that specific rejection decision. Absent such showing, a broader injunction is not appropriate. Moreover, it is notable that Defendants at some point began specifically identifying the objectionable material, clearly a better practice regardless of whether it is constitutionally required.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
