The arbitration agreement's scope extends to \"termination[s] for any reason or for management decisions that ... are discriminatory or retaliatory.\" (Docket No. 53, Ex. 1 at p. 12.) Siracusa's claims involve both her termination and management decisions that were allegedly discriminatory and retaliatory. (Docket No. 47 at p. 1.)

Siracusa claims that Ritz Carlton waived its right to compel arbitration because Ritz Carlton \"ignor[ed] [Siracusa's] timely request to arbitrate\" her claims. (Docket No. 54 at p. 4.) Ritz Carlton has filed two main motions in this action: (1) a motion for extension to file an answer to the complaint, or otherwise plead, and (2) a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction and motion to compel arbitration. (Docket Nos. 49 and 53.) The latter motion was consistent with Ritz Carlton's desire to arbitrate its claims. Ritz Carlton has thus not \"participated in the lawsuit,\" \"invoked the jurisdiction of the court,\" or \"taken other action inconsistent with [its] right.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jones Motor Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"671138\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/671/38/#p44\">\n    671 F.2d at 44\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The parties are also not \"well into preparation of [the] lawsuit,\" nor was there a \"long delay\" before Ritz Carlton sought the enforcement of its right.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jones Motor Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"671138\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/671/38/#p44\">\n    671 F.2d at 44\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

For example, Siracusa claims that she \"held the position of Front Desk Agent in the Ritz Carlton Hotel in Isla Verde, Puerto Rico.\" (Docket No. 47 at p. 2.) Marriott is headquartered in Bethesda, Maryland. (Docket No. 1 at p. 2.) The Court cannot reasonably infer that \"Ritz Carlton Hotel\" includes Marriott in this context. The same implausibility applies to Siracusa's other allegations involving \"Ritz Carlton.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at pp. 2-7. Accordingly, the Court interprets Siracusa's references to \"Ritz Carlton\" and \"Ritz Carlton Hotel\" as relating exclusively to Ritz Carlton, and not including Marriott.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    When compelling arbitration, a court \"shall on application of one of the parties stay the trial of the action until such arbitration has been had.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203\">\n     9 U.S.C. \u00a7 3\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .
