Miller, United States District Judge\n   Pending before the court is a motion to dismiss for improper venue, lack of personal jurisdiction, and failure to state a claim filed by defendants MidCap Financial Trust, f/k/a MidCap Financial, LLC (\"MidCap Trust\"), and MidCap Funding X Trust (\"MidCap Funding\") (collectively, \"MidCap\"). Dkt. 41, 42. This motion was originally filed on September 29, 2017. Dkt. 41, 42. The plaintiffs, who are a group of moving truck drivers, filed a motion for leave to conduct jurisdictional discovery, which the court granted on November 8, 2017. Dkts. 49, 59. The court originally required that the discovery be completed by January 5, 2018, and that the plaintiffs file a supplemental response to MidCap's pending motion for jurisdictional discovery by January 19, 2018. Dkt. 59. The Magistrate Judge extended the deadline for jurisdictional discovery until March 23, 2018, and required the plaintiffs to file a response by April 6, 2018, and MidCap to file a reply by April 13, 2018. Dkt. 85. The plaintiffs filed their supplemental response on April 6 (Dkt. 92), and MidCap filed a reply on April 13 (Dkt. 98).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In the interim, the plaintiffs sought leave to amend their complaint, the court granted leave, and the plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint. Dkts. 94, 103, 104. On April 30, 2018, MidCap filed a notice requesting that the court apply their pending motion to dismiss, which was originally filed in response to the first amended complaint, to the second amended complaint, which the court may do under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Dkt. 105. The original motion to dismiss is now fully briefed and ready for disposition. The court has reviewed all of the relevant documents in the record and the applicable law and is of the opinion that the motion to dismiss for improper venue should be DENIED, the motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction should be GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART, and the motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim should be DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This is a Fair Labor Standards Act (\"FLSA\") case filed by twenty-eight plaintiffs on behalf of themselves and those similarly situated. Dkt. 104. Eleven of the named plaintiffs reside in Texas, and seventeen of the named plaintiffs live outside of Texas.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The plaintiffs were drivers for Graebel Companies, Inc., and they were classified as independent contractors.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The plaintiffs contend that Graebel Companies, Inc., underwent a change in ownership in 2014, became Graebel Van Lines, LLC in 2015, and was eventually dissolved in March 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   They assert that the MidCap financed the purchase of Graebel Companies, Inc., and provided working capital.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   MidCap thus had a security interest in Graebel's and its subsidiaries' assets.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The plaintiffs allege that when the reorganization occurred, the new owners asserted more direct control over the drivers and implemented changes that were detrimental to the company.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The plaintiffs contend that by 2016, Graebel decided to start liquidating at the direction and control of MidCap and a turnaround company, and the liquidation plan was designed to leave the plaintiffs without wages for months.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   They allege that they started receiving only a portion of their pay in October 2016 and that the amount they received was determined via\n   a formula and at the direction of MidCap.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   This formula allegedly calculated an \"advance\" that the drivers would receive based on the gross weight they transported.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Graebel's local terminal managers assured the drivers that they would receive their entire pay, not just the advances, and that they should continue to perform moving services at Graebel's instruction and supervision.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The drivers contend, however, that they never received the balance and were paid nothing for much of the work they performed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   They allege that they learned they would probably never be paid when Graebel announced its liquidation in mid-March 2017.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The plaintiffs claim that MidCap and the other defendants are liable for the actions of Graebel under agency, veil-piercing, or alter-ego theories of vicarious liability and that the corporate forms of the Graebel entities ought to be disregarded.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   They contend that the defendants \"used the Graebel Entities to dupe the [plaintiffs] into continuing to drive for Graebel.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   They allege that the corporate forms of the Graebel entities were organized and operated as a mere tool or business conduit of the defendants and that MidCap and the other defendants used the Graebel entities as a means to shield themselves from liability for claims by unpaid drivers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   They assert that the Graebel entities were inadequately capitalized and that by the time MidCap \" 'called' the note on its revolving line of credit [in February 2017], MidCap had gained complete control and ownership of the Graebel Entities for all practical purposes and from that time on, at the very least acted as the alter ego of the Graebel Entities.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The plaintiffs additionally allege that MidCap is liable for Graebel's fraudulent representations because Graebel made those representations at the direction of MidCap's agent, who had the right to control how Graebel allocated its capital.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The causes of action the plaintiffs assert against MidCap are (1) violation of the FLSA for failure to pay wages because MidCap was an \"employer\" under the FLSA; (2) violation of the FLSA for failure to keep records; (3) breach of contract; (4) quantum meruit; (5) fraud; (6) conspiracy and aider and abettor liability for fraud; and (7) veil piercing, alter ego, and agency liability.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   MidCap moves for the court to dismiss the claims asserted against it because (1) the court lacks personal jurisdiction over MidCap; (2) the plaintiffs have not shown venue is proper in Texas; and (3) the plaintiffs fail to state a claim for which relief can be granted under Rules 8(a) and 9(b). Dkt. 41, 42. With regard to personal jurisdiction, MidCap points out that each plaintiff must establish separately that his or her claims arise out of or relate to MidCap's activities in Texas.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. v.

Dkt. 98.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   With regard to venue, MidCap contends that the plaintiffs have not shown that a substantial part of each plaintiff's claim against MidCap arose in the Southern District of Texas. Dkt. 41, 42. Additionally, MidCap asserts that the \"employment agreements for the non-Texas Plaintiffs have mandatory venue clauses that require those Plaintiffs to pursue litigation arising from their employment in other states.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604783\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1773/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Finally, with regard to their assertion that the plaintiffs fail to state a claim for which relief can be granted, MidCap contends that (1) the plaintiffs' Fair Labor Standards Act (\"FLSA\") claims fail because\n   they are not parties covered by the FLSA; (2) the plaintiffs do not provide any factual support for their FLSA claim; (3) the plaintiffs fail to describe the putative class for the proposed FLSA collective action; (4) the plaintiffs cannot maintain both a conspiracy claim and claims of imputed liability because if there is an agency relationship, there can be no conspiracy; (5) the plaintiffs fail to state a claim for conspiracy because they do not plead it with particularity; (6) the plaintiffs cannot assert a claim for \"aider and abettor liability\" because no such claim exists independent of a conspiracy claim in Texas; (7) the plaintiffs do not meet Rule 9(b)'s standard with regard to the corporate veil and alter ego theories for imputing the fraud claims to MidCap; (8) the plaintiffs fail to state a claim for breach of contract with regard to the corporate veil and alter ego theories for imputing the claims to MidCap; and (9) the plaintiffs fail to state a claim to impute liability under an agency theory.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604783\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1773/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The court will first review the legal standards for motions to dismiss for improper venue, lack of personal jurisdiction, and failure to state a claim.

But, \u00a7 1391(b)(2) permits venue in \"a judicial district in which a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the\n   <em>\n    claim\n   </em>\n   occurred,\" and there are not allegations of alleged misrepresentations made to\n   <em>\n    each\n   </em>\n   plaintiff by the defendants in this district. Thus, the plaintiffs have not shown that venue is proper with regard to the claims of non-Texas plaintiffs under \u00a7 1391(b)(2). The plaintiffs' main argument is thus that venue is proper under the fallback provision, \u00a7 1391(b)(3), because there is no other district in which the entire action could be filed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The plaintiffs rely primarily on\n   <em>\n    McCaskey v. Continental Airlines, Inc.\n   </em>\n   In\n   <em>\n    McCaskey\n   </em>\n   , the court noted, while discussing the fallback provision, that it \"requires that another district exist in which Plaintiff can establish both personal jurisdiction and venue over each party and each claim in the\n   <em>\n    entire\n   </em>\n   action, not just over a single claim versus [a particular defendant].\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11118702\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/133/514/#p526\">\n    133 F.Supp.2d 514\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 526 (S.D. Tex. 2001) (Kent, J) (citations and quotations omitted). The court reached this conclusion because the fallback provision uses the term \"action,\" as opposed to \"claim,\" when stating that it applies if \"there is no district in which an action may otherwise be brought.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   \u00a7 1391 ;\n   <em>\n    McCaskey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11118702\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/133/514/#p526\">\n    133 F.Supp.2d at 526\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court concluded that in order for the defendant to show that venue was not proper under the fallback provision, it had to show that it could have been sued in a different venue and that \"the whole action, involving multiple properly joined parties and claims could have been brought in its entirety in another district court.\"\n   <em>\n    McCaskey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11118702\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/133/514/#p526\">\n    133 F.Supp.2d at 526\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court acknowledged that the \"burden rests on the plaintiff to establish a prima facie case of venue,\" but it declined \"to require a plaintiff who seeks to utilize [the fallback provision] to negate every single one of the hundreds of judicial districts as plausible venues.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11118702\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/133/514/#p526\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Instead, the court found it more appropriate for the defendant to \"posit a forum and articulate reasons why such is available, in terms of both venue and jurisdiction, in order to necessitate any response from a plaintiff in this regard.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11118702\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/133/514/#p526\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   MidCap contends that the fallback provision cannot apply because claims by the non-Texas plaintiffs who were not parties to the alleged misrepresentations in Houston could be brought in another district. Dkt. 58. However, as the\n   <em>\n    McCaskey\n   </em>\n   court noted, the fallback provision does not separate the plaintiffs. It states that it applies if there is no other district in which an\n   <em>\n    action\n   </em>\n   may otherwise be brought,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1391(b)(3), which is different than the use of the term \"claim\" in \u00a7 1391(b)(2). Here, the entire\n   <em>\n    action\n   </em>\n   may not be brought in some other district because\n   there are Texas plaintiffs who would not have been parties to any misrepresentations that occurred in these other districts. The fallback provision applies, and the plaintiffs have asserted a prima facie case that venue is proper in the Souther District of Texas under this provision-so long as the court can exercise personal jurisdiction over the defendants.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1391(b). The motion to dismiss for improper venue is DENIED. The court, therefore, now turns to personal jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Dkt. 98 at 8 (citing Dkt. 92-8 (Gould Dep.) at 165-67, 169-70). Indeed, Gould testified that (1) MidCap did not own stock of Graebel; (2) MidCap and Graebel did not share offices and MidCap merely sat in Graebel's conference room while they were in Dallas; (3) MidCap and Graebel did not share any directors or officers and did not share an accounting system; (4) MidCap did not exercise control over Graebel's daily activities; (5) MidCap did not create policies and procedures for Graebel; (6) MidCap and Graebel did not share a common business operation; (7) MidCap and Graebel are distinct types of businesses, have different management, and separate daily operations; (8) they do not share tax filings; (9) MidCap could not hire and fire Graebel employees or contractors or set their pay; and (10) MidCap did not control Graebel's allocation of capital.

Gould asserted that MidCap was simply a lender to Graebel.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 170.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The court finds that the evidence presented is insufficient to make a prima facie showing to support the plaintiffs' alter ego theory. MidCap's control over Graebel, like the control exercised in\n   <em>\n    Valdes\n   </em>\n   , was confined to protecting its investment. It does not appear that MidCap directed Graebel regarding how to use the capital it advanced, other than controlling how much it advanced and when, but even if it had controlled this to some extent, the Fifth Circuit noted in\n   <em>\n    Valdes\n   </em>\n   that a lender\n   approving every single business expenditure does not necessarily mean the lender has the degree of control required to demonstrate alter ego.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Valdes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1635552\" index=\"183\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/810/1345/\">\n    810 F.2d at 1355\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . MidCap's team in Dallas was there to monitor its collateral, and it appears that they stayed in the conference room and did just that. The plaintiffs have provided the court with no evidence that MidCap exercised any greater degree of control that the financial institution in\n   <em>\n    Valdes\n   </em>\n   , and they have not provided evidence supporting the other alter ego factors. Accordingly, the court finds that the plaintiffs have not met their burden and that the court may not exercise jurisdiction over MidCap under an alter ego theory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Agency\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   The plaintiffs also assert that Texas has jurisdiction over MidCap because MidCap had complete financial control over Graebel and Graebel was merely MidCap's agent. Dkt. 92 (citing Dkts. 6, 42, 92-2 at 28-30). MidCap contends that the plaintiffs' agency theory fails because the plaintiffs do not offer any support for their allegations that MidCap directed Graebel to make misrepresentations to Graebel's drivers.

They show that MidCap was in control of the release of funds,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 92, Ex. B at 28-30 (O. Gomez Dep.), but they have not presented any evidence raising a prima facie case that MidCap told Graebel to stop paying its drivers. William D. Gould, MidCap Trust's president of specialty finance, testified that MidCap did not direct Graebel to stop paying the drivers, did not direct anyone to pay only partial payments to drivers, and did not come up with a formula regarding how much to pay drivers. Dkt. 92, Ex. E at 168-69. The plaintiffs point to evidence that MidCap did not agree to provide extra funds to pay the drivers that was over the amount of the borrowing certificate in December 2016 even though it has provided extra funds to make payroll days earlier (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 92-2 at 42, 47, 49, 71), but this evidence is insufficient to demonstrate that MidCap was telling Graebel who to pay and not pay with the amount that was available in the regular allotment of funds. Because the plaintiffs do not cite sufficient evidence to refute Gould's testimony or any affirmative evidence that MidCap controlled the means and details of Graebel's business that gave rise to the plaintiffs' causes of action,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 92 at 18 (citing only the Gomez declaration in support of their agency argument), they have not sufficiently established an agency relationship.

Conspiracy\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   The plaintiffs argue that MidCap's active participation with Texas co-conspirators to commit a tort in Texas that injures Texas residents subjects MidCap to personal jurisdiction.

Dkt. 104. There was allegedly a meeting of the minds to defraud the drivers and MidCap's alleged overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy was failing to allocate funds to pay the plaintiffs.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4044343\" index=\"196\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/929/625/#p630\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The plaintiffs submit evidence that a MidCap team was working out of Graebel's Dallas, Texas, office in early 2017 to monitor its collateral and that Graebel managers, calling in from Texas, told the plaintiffs in October 2016 that the drivers would eventually be paid so long as they continued to generate revenue. Additionally, the plaintiffs provide evidence that a Graebel manager held a meeting in Houston, Texas, on March 13, 2017, and he told the drivers that the company had \"a fund set up to pay the driver(s) whatever drivers Graebel still owes there's a fund set up to pay them.\" Dkt. 92, Exs.

The banks own the company, not Armstrong, the banks.\" Dkt. L-1 at 19. The plaintiffs contend that this evidence conclusively shows that MidCap knew the plaintiffs were not being paid and continued to allocate resources for the business to continue operating without paying the drivers and that the evidence, viewed as a whole, strongly indicates that MidCap knowingly participated in Graebel's fraud and instructed Graebel to keep the drivers working on the promise of future payment.

Dkt. 98 at 4. MidCap also argues that its claims do not arise out of the same nucleus of facts involved in the receivership.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5. It contends that the receivership involves only whether the receiver can collect assets pledged to MidCap as collateral, whereas the focus of this case is whether MidCap is responsible for wages owed to the plaintiffs under the FLSA.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Local Rule 7.4\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   The court will first address MidCap's assertion that the court should not consider the consent argument. Southern District of Texas Local Rule 7.4 states that \"[f]ailure to respond will be taken as a representation of no opposition.\" S.D. Tex. L.R. 7.4. In the plaintiffs' original response to MidCap's motion to dismiss, they contend that \"MidCap now attempts to reap the fruits of its own fraud by filing suit in Texas state court against Graebel Van Lines and the other Graebel entities to collect on its $60 million note\" and that \"MidCap cannot-at least not with a\n   straight face-contend that it would be unduly burdensome to be haled into Texas to defend itself when MidCap is already prosecuting a case that arises out of the same transactions.\" Dkt. 47 at 12, 28;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 31. They also note in that response, in a footnote, that they intervened in the receivership and requested \"a constructive trust be imposed over any proceeds directly traceable to their unpaid work and that those proceeds be impounded in the Court registry pending the outcome of this action.\" Dkt. 47 at 6 n.2. Thus, while the plaintiffs did not directly say that MidCap\n   <em>\n    consented\n   </em>\n   to jurisdiction in their original response, the assertion of this argument now can hardly be considered a surprise that is prejudicial to MidCap. Moreover, MidCap had the opportunity to respond to the argument via supplemental briefing. The court is not bound to robotically apply its own rules and has considerable discretion to manage its own docket. Here, it finds that there is no reason to disallow the argument simply because it was not expressly raised in the original briefing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Consent\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   The court now turns to the substance of the argument that by instituting the receivership action in Dallas, MidCap Funding consented to jurisdiction in this case.

That is different than purposefully taking advantage of the forum's laws in a case that arises out of the same nucleus of operative facts like the cases cited by the plaintiffs. The question here, then, is whether the receivership action arose out of the same nucleus of operative facts as this lawsuit. While MidCap asserts that the \"\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   issue involved in the receivership action is whether the receiver can collect assets pledged to MidCap as collateral,\" the impact of the plaintiffs' claim to those same assets will be an important factor in the case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 98 at 4. Being a factor in a case and having the same operative facts are, however, not the same. The Receivership lawsuit is not as related to this lawsuit as the lawsuits were in the cases cited by the plaintiffs in which the courts determined that the exercise of personal jurisdiction was appropriate. But it is not an attenuated relationship, either. Instead, it is like this entire case is a small part of the receivership action because the plaintiffs are claiming part of the funds from that case based on the arguments that they are entitled to the funds that they make in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   While this case seems like more of a close call than the cases relied upon by the plaintiffs, the court agrees with the plaintiffs' purposeful availment argument. The plaintiffs assert that the receivership case is \"essentially a state court bankruptcy [because] it purports to dispose of all of the Graebel Entities' assets.\" Dkt. 92 at 14. They contend that it \"deals with the very property for which the Graebel Drivers claim a constructive trust in this action\" and that their claim for a constructive trust here \"could not be more related to the Dallas Receivership.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Because it arises from the same operative facts, though a subportion of those facts, MidCap Funding has purposefully availed itself of the benefits and protections of Texas laws as they relate to these facts, and it is not unfair to subject it to jurisdiction in Texas. Accordingly, the court finds, notwithstanding the plaintiffs' failure to meet their burden with regard to their other jurisdictional theories, that it may exercise jurisdiction over MidCap Funding due to consent. MidCap Funding's motion to dismiss\n   for lack of personal jurisdiction is therefore\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   <strong>\n    7. MidCap Trust\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   The plaintiffs define the two MidCap entities as \"MidCap\" in their briefing and do not distinguish the entities in their jurisdictional arguments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 92. MidCap asserts that this is legally improper and that the plaintiffs' assertion of claims against MidCap Trust disregards facts adduced during jurisdictional discovery. Dkt. 98. MidCap contends that MidCap Trust entered into the loan with Graebel in 2014 and simultaneously assigned the loan to MidCap Funding X.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citing Dkt. 92-8 (Gould Dep.) ). MidCap asserts that since that assignment, MidCap Trust has \"had nothing to do with the Graebel loan.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citing Dkt. 92-8 (Gould Dep.) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   The court agrees that it is improper for the plaintiffs to lump the MidCap entities together without demonstrating why the court may exercise jurisdiction over each entity. Because the plaintiffs have presented no evidence relating directly to MidCap Trust and the defendants present evidence that MidCap Trust was not involved with the events that gave rise to this lawsuit, the plaintiffs have not presented a prima facie case of jurisdiction. The motion to dismiss, as it relates to MidCap Trust, is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

Dkt. 42 at 15-16. The plaintiffs argue that their amended pleading adequately establishes either individual or enterprise coverage under the FLSA. Dkt. 47 at 42. MidCap replies that the plaintiffs do not sufficiently allege individual coverage because they do not state which plaintiffs engaged in work across state lines and they do not sufficiently allege enterprise coverage because MidCap and Graebel are in completely different industries and thus cannot be an \"enterprise.\" Dkt. 58 at 7-8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   The FLSA protects employees who are \"engaged 'in the production of goods for commerce' ('individual coverage')\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   'employed in an enterprise engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce' ('enterprise coverage').\"\n   <em>\n    Martin v.

Dkt. 47 at 35. They contend that the plaintiffs' \"jobs inherently involved transporting customers' belongings in interstate commerce,\" and that the first amended complaint reflects that in the first paragraph.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 37. They additionally contend that enterprise coverage exists because they adequately allege that MidCap is their FLSA employer and that it is Graebel's alter ego and that all entities had the common business purpose of maximizing revenue for the benefit of MidCap.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   The first couple of paragraphs of the second amended complaint discuss the nature of Graebel's business, including an allegation that it \"was in the business of providing local, intrastate, and interstate\n   moving, storage, and relocation services for professionals.\" Dkt. 104 at 2. This allegation, however, is insufficient to establish individual coverage because it does not indicate that each of the plaintiffs provided interstate moving services, and it is possible that some plaintiffs worked only locally. For individual coverage, the plaintiffs must be more specific about the work of each individual since the industry engages in local, intrastate, and interstate commerce.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   With regard to enterprise coverage, it is plausible from the facts alleged that Graebel engaged in commerce and had employees engaged in commerce, as the plaintiffs allege there were locations throughout the United States and that it was engaged in interstate moving and relocation services. Dkt. 104. MidCap, on the other hand, is a financial institution.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   However, the plaintiffs include numerous allegations that MidCap had control over Graebel's business when decisions were being made regarding payments to the drivers.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   Since the court must take the allegations in the complaint as true when considering a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6),\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   there are sufficient allegations that MidCap worked in concert with Graebel to operate the business for the common business purpose of protecting MidCap's return on its investment.

FLSA Claim, In General\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   MidCap next asserts that the court should dismiss the FLSA claim because the plaintiffs generally recite the elements of an FLSA claim without any factual support. Dkt. 42. It also asserts that the claim should be dismissed because the plaintiffs are exempt from the FLSA's overtime provisions and that the collective action claims should be dismissed because the plaintiffs do not adequately identify the putative class.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   The plaintiffs argue that MidCap ignores the factual allegations that clearly state a claim under the FLSA.

They note that the complaint alleges that (1) the plaintiffs were employed by the defendants; (2) they were not paid a wage as required by FLSA; and (3) the putative class is drivers who were not paid.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 41-42.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   The court finds, taking the allegations in the complaint as true, that the plaintiffs have adequately stated a claim under the FLSA and have identified the putative class. MidCap's motion to dismiss because the plaintiffs did not plead sufficient facts to support their FLSA claim, have no claim because they were exempt from the FLSA, and did not adequately identify the putative class is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   <strong>\n    3.

However, it is premature to dismiss one theory in favor of another at the motion to dismiss stage if the theories are all adequately pled.

Dkt. 42 at 18-19. It contends that the plaintiffs merely allege a lender-debtor relationship and fail to plead an unlawful overt act.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20.

In the second amended complaint, the plaintiffs allege a \"meeting of the minds\" to defraud the drivers and a decision by MidCap to fail to allocate capital to pay the drivers. Dkt. 104 at 38. MidCap contends that the conclusory allegation that MidCap did not allocate enough capital is not an unlawful and overt act. Dkt. 58. However, if MidCap is an \"employer\" under the FLSA as alleged and purposefully did not allocate capital so that the drivers would not be paid, this would be an overt act that is unlawful under the FLSA.

Veil Piercing/Alter Ego\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   The court now turns to the plaintiffs' veil piercing theories. First, the court notes that MidCap asserts in its reply in support of its motion to dismiss that the\n   plaintiffs concede in their response that their fraud claims only include Graebel, Peterson, and Gomez.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 58. However, the second amended complaint asserts a fraud claim against all the defendants and notes that MidCap is liable because Graebel acted as MidCap's agent and also under alter ego and veil-piercing theories. Dkt. 104 at 37. Thus, while the direct fraud claims may include only Graebel, Peterson, and Gomez, there is still an allegation that MidCap is liable for the fraud.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   MidCap requests that the court dismiss these imputed liability claims. It contends that the plaintiffs' veil piercing and alter ego fraud and breach of contract claims cannot survive because (1) the plaintiffs do not meet Rule 9(b)'s heightened pleading standard for the fraud claim; and (2) a contract claimant may only pierce the veil if the defendant has committed actual fraud against the plaintiff for the defendant's personal benefit. Dkt. 42 at 23-24. The plaintiffs argue that their complaint contains sufficient allegations to support their alter ego theory to pierce the corporate veil. Dkt. 47 at 53-54. In reply, MidCap relies on\n   <em>\n    Valdes\n   </em>\n   , which MidCap argues the plaintiffs cannot meaningfully distinguish.

Taking these allegations as true, the plaintiffs have pled enough facts to meet the Rule 9(b) pleading standard for their alter ego fraud claim, and they have sufficiently alleged that MidCap committed fraud against the plaintiffs for its own personal benefit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 104 at 41-42. MidCap's motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim with regard to these theories is therefore\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   <strong>\n    7. Agency\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   Finally, with regard to the plaintiffs' attempt to impute liability under an agency theory, MidCap asserts that the plaintiffs do not meet Rule 9(b)'s standard because they do not provide any specificity about actual or apparent authority. Dkt. 42 at 24-25. MidCap also contends that there is no indication that MidCap had the right to control the means and details of Graebel's day-to-day operations. Dkt. 58 at 9-10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   In the second amended complaint, the plaintiffs allege that MidCap had the right to control how Graebel allocated capital and to control the means and details of the processes Graebel used to maximize its revenue. Dkt. 104 at 42-43. They also assert that the credit and security agreement between MidCap and Graebel gave MidCap \"virtual control over all of the Graebel Entities.\" Dkt. 104 at 23. The second amended complaint delineates the specific paragraphs of the contract that it contends provided this degree of control.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 23-25 (quoting portions of the agreement). The second amended complaint provides rough dates and alleges that MidCap directed Graebel to cut costs and eventually directed Graebel to stop paying the drivers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26. The court finds that there are sufficient allegations in the second amended complaint that, if taken as true, meet the Rule 9(b) requirements of pleading liability for fraud due to an agency relationship. The motion to dismiss this claim is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   MidCap's motion to dismiss (Dkt. 41, 42) is GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.
