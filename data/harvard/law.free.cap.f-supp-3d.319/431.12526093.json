Before the Court are the Department of Justice's Motion for Summary Judgment, Dkt. 16, and Judicial Watch's Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment, Dkt. 18. For the reasons that follow, the Court will grant the Department of Justice's Motion for Summary Judgment and\n   deny Judicial Watch's Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On November 2, 2016, CNN reported that WikiLeaks had released a hacked email sent from Peter Kadzik's personal email account to a personal email account used by John Podesta, who was then serving as the chairman of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign. Compl. \u00b6 5, Dkt. 1 (citing Laura Koran,\n   <em>\n    Hacked Email Appears to Show DOJ Official Tipping Clinton Campaign About Review\n   </em>\n   , CNN (Nov. 2, 2016, 10:47 AM), https://www.cnn.com/2016/11/02/politics/peter-kadzik-john-podesta-wikileaks/index.html). Kadzik's May 19, 2015 email to Podesta, which was attached to an earlier filing in this case, refers to matters \"concerning the State Department's review of former Secretary Clinton's emails.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Five days after the CNN report, Judicial Watch submitted two FOIA requests to the Department of Justice's FOIA/Privacy Act Mail Referral Unit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Statement of Material Facts \u00b6 1, Dkt. 16-1; First Brinkmann Decl. \u00b6 3, Dkt. 16-3. Judicial Watch's first request sought (1) emails conducting official business that were \"sent to or received by\" Kadzik at his personal email account from January 1, 2016 to November 7, 2016, and (2) emails that were copied or forwarded from Kadzik's personal email account to his official government email account during the same timeframe.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Statement of Material Facts \u00b6 5. Judicial Watch's second request targeted emails that Kadzik exchanged with the following individuals from December 1, 2014 to November 7, 2016 while using either his personal email account or his official government email account: (1) \"any non-government employee,\" if the email relates to Clinton's use of \"non-state.gov email to conduct official government business,\" (2) John Podesta, and (3) \"any official, officer, or employee\" of Clinton's presidential campaign.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On November 17, 2016, the Department of Justice's FOIA/Privacy Act Mail Referral Unit acknowledged Judicial Watch's FOIA requests by sending two letters notifying Judicial Watch that the requests were referred to the Office of Information Policy (OIP), an office within the Department of Justice that processes FOIA requests seeking records from the offices of the Attorney General, Deputy Attorney General, Associate Attorney General, Legal Policy, Legislative Affairs, and Public Affairs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   First Brinkmann Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 3-4. Four days later, OIP sent Judicial Watch two emails identifying the tracking numbers assigned to each FOIA request. Compl. \u00b6 14. After 45 days passed without OIP producing records responsive to the requests, Judicial Watch commenced this lawsuit on January 5, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 17-18; First Brinkmann Decl. \u00b6 7. Four months later, OIP released fifty-six pages of records responsive to Judicial Watch's FOIA requests.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   First Brinkmann Decl. \u00b6 22 (discussing OIP's April 28, 2017 letter providing the agency's final response to Judicial Watch's FOIA requests).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On June 12, 2017, the Department of Justice moved for summary judgment. Def.'s Mot., Dkt. 16. In support of its motion, the Department of Justice submitted a sworn declaration by OIP Senior Counsel Vanessa R. Brinkmann, the official responsible for supervising OIP's FOIA request processing. Brinkmann's declaration describes the searches OIP conducted of Kadzik's official Department of Justice email account and the searches Kadzik conducted of his personal Gmail email account.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   First Brinkmann Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 9-21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Judicial Watch opposed the Department of Justice's motion and filed a cross-motion for summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp'n &amp; Cross-Mot., Dkt. 17. Judicial Watch does not challenge OIP's searches of Kadzik's official email account but contends that the Brinkmann declaration's description of Kadzik's searches of his personal email account lacks sufficient detail to assess whether Kadzik's searches were adequate and reasonably calculated to discover the records that Judicial Watch seeks.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-2. Judicial Watch deems the declaration defective because: (1) it does not provide sufficient evidence about how Kadzik searched for work-related emails in his personal email account; and (2) it does not explain why the same search terms were not used to search Kadzik's official Department of Justice and personal email accounts. Judicial Watch Reply at 2, Dkt. 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On June 6, 2018, the Court heard argument on the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hr'g Tr., June 6, 2018, Dkt. 27. Thereafter, the Court ordered the Department of Justice to submit a supplemental declaration clarifying Kadzik's representations about his email practices and the electronic and manual searches he conducted of his personal email account. Order of June 9, 2018, Dkt. 24. In response to the Court's order, the Department of Justice filed a second declaration by Brinkmann that provides additional details.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Resp., Dkt. 28; Second Brinkmann Decl., Dkt. 28-1. Despite this clarifying information, Judicial Watch contends that the Department of Justice has not met its burden to prove the adequacy of its searches, and Judicial Watch requests that the Court order the Department of Justice to conduct a new search of Kadzik's personal email account using the search terms identified in paragraph 13 of the first Brinkmann declaration: \"Clinton\" \"HRC,\" \"Hillary,\" \"Podesta,\" \"Palmieri,\" and \"Fallon.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Joint Status Report \u00b6\u00b6 14, 19, Dkt. 29.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Before addressing the merits of the parties' arguments, the Court summarizes the two Brinkmann declarations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Brinkmann Declarations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The first Brinkmann declaration indicates that OIP launched a comprehensive search of Kadzik's official government email account \"using a sophisticated 'electronic search and review platform.' \" Def.'s Statement of Material Facts \u00b6 9 (quoting First Brinkmann Decl. \u00b6 12). To identify emails responsive to Judicial Watch's first FOIA request, OIP used Kadzik's personal email address as a search term with the goal of \"captur[ing] any emails between Mr. Kadzik's DOJ and Gmail email accounts, including emails copied, blind copied, or forwarded between the two accounts.\" First Brinkmann Decl. \u00b6 12. Staff from OIP reviewed the search results and determined that no retrieved records were responsive to Judicial Watch's FOIA request.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12. OIP nonetheless produced two email chains totaling fifteen pages that Kadzik had forwarded from his personal email account to his official government email account.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5 n.2. Although neither email chain discussed official government business, OIP provided them to Judicial Watch \"as a matter of discretion.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   To retrieve emails responsive to Judicial Watch's second FOIA request, OIP also searched Kadzik's official government email account for the terms \"Clinton,\" \"HRC,\" \"Hillary,\" \"Podesta,\" \"Palmieri,\" and \"Fallon.\" Def.'s Statement of Material Facts \u00b6\u00b6 13-16, Dkt. 16-1. OIP selected\n   these search terms based on Kadzik's representation that any communications he exchanged with Clinton's campaign employees \"would have been limited to John Podesta, Jennifer Palmieri, or Brian Fallon.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15 (quoting First Brinkmann Decl. \u00b6 13). Using the search terms \"Clinton,\" \"HRC,\" and \"Hillary\" enabled OIP to capture any emails between Kadzik and non-government employees relating to Clinton's use of non-state.gov email to conduct official government business.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16. As a result of these searches, OIP staff identified 56 pages of records that were responsive to Judicial Watch's second FOIA request. First Brinkmann Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 13, 34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In light of Judicial Watch's allegations about Kadzik's use of his personal email account, \"OIP reached out to [the Office of Legislative Affairs], and to Mr. Kadzik himself, to assess whether all relevant records would be encompassed by a search of his official DOJ account, and to confirm that Mr. Kadzik understood his obligations under the Federal Records Act and DOJ Policy to fully capture official records in DOJ recordkeeping systems, and/or to otherwise identify and provide them upon receipt of OIP's search notification.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19. In particular, \"government employees may not use a non-official e-mail account for official business unless the communication is fully captured in a [Department of Justice] recordkeeping system-either by copying their official account or forwarding any such messages to their official account within twenty days.\" First Brinkmann Decl. \u00b6 14 n.4;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Statement of Material Facts \u00b6 19, Dkt. 16-1. Following these discussions, Kadzik searched his personal email account using terms that were not identified in the first Brinkmann declaration. Def.'s Statement of Material Facts \u00b6 21. The second Brinkmann declaration makes clear, however, that Kadzik searched \"the entirety of his personal Gmail account, without any date-range or folder limitations.\" Second Brinkmann Decl. \u00b6 8. And Kadzik used \"to the best of his recollection ... at a minimum-all of the search terms listed in paragraph 13 of the First Brinkmann Declaration\" to conduct these electronic searches.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Kadzik also may have used \"additional search terms, or additional variants on those search terms,\" but he does not recall those terms.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Kadzik supplemented his term-driven searches by manually reviewing his personal email account's sent, inbox, and trash folders, First Brinkmann Decl. \u00b6 16, which consisted of no more than approximately 600 total emails, Second Brinkmann Decl. \u00b6 12. To conduct his manual search, Kadzik \"reviewed the subject lines and to/from fields of all emails from the inbox, trash, and sent folders\" and \"opened and read any emails that, based on either their subject line, author, or recipient, could have been potentially DOJ-related.\" Second Brinkmann Decl. \u00b6 10. Kadzik then \"opened and read every single email in any of his archived folders that could have contained DOJ-related emails.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Kazdik's electronic and manual searches did not reveal the Podesta email\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   or any other records responsive to Judicial Watch's FOIA requests. First Brinkmann Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 9, 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Based on Kadzik's dual searches and representations, OIP determined that it \"had no basis to believe that any potentially responsive official records would likely be located in any records systems other than Mr. Kadzik's DOJ account.\" First\n   Brinkmann Decl. \u00b6 16. \"Nonetheless, out of an abundance of caution, and in light of the allegations in the Complaint,\" Department of Justice attorneys in OIP, the Office of Legislative Affairs, and the Civil Division met again with Kadzik before he left the Department of Justice in January 2017.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17. During that meeting, Kadzik made additional representations that bolstered OIP's confidence that Kadzik had no agency records in his personal email account, but OIP nevertheless requested that Kadzik again search his personal email account. Def.'s Statement of Material Facts \u00b6\u00b6 26, 27. Kadzic then searched his personal email account using the terms \"Podesta,\" \"johnpodesta@gmail.com,\" and \"other variants\" of those terms.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29. He also manually searched his email folders again, including sorting and chronologically reviewing emails in his \"sent\" folder.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30. These searches were \" 'designed to either locate, or confirm the nonexistence of, the alleged email to John Podesta referenced in the complaint.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28 (quoting First Brinkmann Decl. \u00b6 19). As before, Kadzik failed to uncover any email that might be considered an agency record responsive to Judicial Watch's FOIA requests, including the alleged email from Kadzik to Podesta that was the subject of the CNN report.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31. Kadzik ultimately \" 'confirmed that he did not recall ever using his personal Gmail account to send any other similar emails to John Podesta, or to anyone else associated with the Clinton Campaign.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33 (quoting First Brinkmann Decl. \u00b6 19). Kadzik represented to the Department of Justice that he was confident that his Gmail account did not contain any agency records or potential agency records.

R. Civ. P. 56(a). \"Materiality is, of course, a function of the applicable legal standard, which in this case is that an agency responding to a FOIA request must conduct a search reasonably calculated to uncover all relevant documents, and, if challenged, must demonstrate beyond material doubt that the search was reasonable.\"\n   <em>\n    Kowalczyk v.

But here, the Department of Justice did not restrict its search to Kadzik's official email account. Instead, OIP reached out to both the Office of Legislative Affairs and to Kadzik to determine whether Kadzik's official government email account was the only record system likely to contain agency records responsive to Judicial Watch's FOIA requests. First Brinkmann Decl. \u00b6 16. OIP also sought to confirm Kadzik's understanding about his obligation to make sure agency records were in a Department of Justice record system or to provide them in response to a search notification from OIP.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%205922293\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Thereafter, on two separate occasions, Kadzik conducted multiple comprehensive electronic term and manual searches of his personal email account to ensure that it contained no records responsive to Judicial Watch's FOIA requests. On the first, Kadzik searched his personal email account using unidentified terms.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%205922293\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   He also supplemented his term-driven search by manually reviewing the sent, inbox, and trash folders of his personal email account.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%205922293\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   On the second, Kadzik searched his personal email account, at the direction of OIP attorneys, using the terms \"Podesta,\" \"johnpodesta@gmail.com,\" and \"other variants\" of those terms.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29. Kadzik also manually searched his email folders a second time, including by sorting and chronologically reviewing emails in his \"sent\" folder.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Without knowing the specific terms that Kadzik used to conduct his electronic searches, and how Kadzik conducted his manual searches, it would be difficult to conclude that Kadzik's searches were reasonably calculated to discover the records Judicial Watch seeks.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reporters Comm. for Freedom of Press v. Fed. Bureau of Investigation\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264644\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/877/399/#p402\">\n    877 F.3d 399\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 402 (D.C. Cir. 2017). But the additional details provided in the second Brinkmann declaration submitted in response to the Court's June 9, 2018 order enable the Court to draw that conclusion here. Specifically, the second Brinkmann declaration makes clear that Kadzik performed his first electronic term search using, \"to the best of his recollection,\" the search terms listed in paragraph 13 of the First Brinkmann Declaration and additional search terms that Kadzik does not recall.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Second Brinkmann Decl. \u00b6 8. And Kadzik searched his entire personal account, without any date-range\n   or folder limitations.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264644\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/877/399/#p402\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The second declaration also indicates that Kadzik conducted thorough manual searches. He not only reviewed the subject lines and to/from fields of all emails from the inbox, trash, and sent folders in his personal Gmail account, Kadzik also opened and read any emails that, based on either their subject line, author, or recipient, could have been potentially DOJ-related.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10. In short, Kadzik \"opened and read every single email in any of his archived folders that could have contained DOJ-related emails.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Notwithstanding these searches, Judicial Watch argues that the Court should order a further search of Kadzik's Gmail account because Kadzik's recent representations about his searches were made \"to the best of his recollection,\" and over a year has lapsed since he conducted the searches. Joint Status Report \u00b6 16. Judicial Watch views the phrase \"to the best of [Kadzik's] recollection\" as a qualifier that signals that \"neither the Justice Department nor [Kadzik] can remember what [Kadzik] did over one year ago.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The Court disagrees. Not only is it customary for a declarant or affiant to qualify sworn statements by using the phrase \"to the best of [one's] recollection,\" federal courts have required this phrase to be used when, for example, ordering a witness to verify the truthfulness of his answers.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Henslee v. Simmons\n   </em>\n   , No. 1:04CV152-02-MU,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20WL%202180850\">\n    2010 WL 2180850\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (W.D.N.C. May 25, 2010) (ordering a witness who chose to voluntarily answer a plaintiff's questions rather than be subpoenaed to supply a declaration stating that he attempted to provide truthful answers \"to the best of his recollection\");\n   <em>\n    Cordeiro v.

Cal. April 17, 2009) (ordering a petitioner to submit a declaration \"stating, to the best of his recollection, the date on which he believed his first state habeas petition [was provided] to prison authorities\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Moreover, to the extent that this qualifying phrase calls into doubt the completeness of Kadzik's electronic term searches, any deficiency is negated by the comprehensive manual searches Kadzik conducted. As described, Kadzik reviewed \"the subject lines and to/from fields of all emails from the inbox, trash, and sent folders\" and opened and read \"any emails that,\n   <em>\n    based on either their subject line, author, or recipient, could have been potentially DOJ-related\n   </em>\n   .\" Second Brinkmann Decl. \u00b6 10 (emphasis added). He also \"opened and read\n   <em>\n    every single email\n   </em>\n   in any of his archived folders\n   <em>\n    that could have contained DOJ-related emails\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20WL%201044950\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). Kadzik's belt-and-suspenders approach provides more than adequate support for the conclusion that the Department of Justice's search was reasonably calculated to discover the records that Judicial Watch seeks here. Finally, Kadzik's representations about his email practices provide further support for this conclusion. In particular, Kadzik confirmed that \"he did not recall ever using his personal email account to send any other similar emails to John Podesta, or to anyone else associated with the Clinton Campaign.' \" First Brinkmann Decl. \u00b6 19. He also was \"confident that his personal Gmail account-in its entirety-contained no agency records or potential agency records.\" Second Brinkman Decl. \u00b6 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In sum, the Court concludes-based on the descriptions of Kadzik's electronic and manual searches and his representations about his email practices-that the Department of Justice has satisfied its burden to show that its search was adequate.
