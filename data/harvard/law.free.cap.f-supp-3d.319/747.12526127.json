Relator cites no Second Circuit case law in support of this argument. Moreover, Relator was the one who failed to brief any opposition to dismissal with prejudice or to request leave to amend.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Memorandum of Law in Opposition to Defendants' Motions to Dismiss, Dkt. 150. The Second Circuit has held that it \"will not deem it an abuse of the district court's discretion to order a case closed when leave to amend has not been sought.\"\n   <em>\n    Campo v.

Servicer Defendants had also previously argued in their joint submission to the Court in advance of the initial conference that Relator should not be allowed to file another amended complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Joint Letter to the Court dated Apr. 12, 2018, at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Separately, Relator's motion for reconsideration lacks merit because it is essentially a renewal of a request for discovery that this Court has already denied. Relator's motion provides no information illustrating how he could replead with sufficient specificity to meet the particularity requirement; instead, Relator argues that he\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   replead with sufficient specificity for Rule 9(b)\n   <em>\n    if\n   </em>\n   he can obtain limited discovery from the Government related to the Servicer Defendants. Relator made the same request for limited discovery before the initial conference with the Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Apr. 17, 2018 Tr. at 16:6-17. The Court denied it then, staying all discovery pending a decision on the motions to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19:20-21.

Relator seeks to amend on the basis of conversations he had with outside counsel for Chase surrounding a brief that relator submitted in a bankruptcy case in\n   <em>\n    January 2012\n   </em>\n   . To qualify as a ground for reconsideration, new evidence must have been \"not previously available\" to the movant.\n   <em>\n    Almaty, Kaz. v.

Specifically, Relator cites the Court's comments earlier in the colloquy that the Court \"would be not quite compelled - but close to it - to grant leave to file an additional complaint\" and that \"the likelihood is extremely high that I would allow repleading\" if the claims were dismissed for failure to satisfy Rule 9(b). See Rel. Memo at 4 (citing Apr. 17, 2018 Tr. at 4:4-16; 12:14-20). As this language makes clear, this was an expression of likelihood, not a guarantee, and thereafter Relator explicitly chose to \"take [his] chances\" on the present complaint rather than amend it, as the Court proposed.

Memo. at 11. These statements are insufficient to explain how amendment could affect the Court's conclusion that relator could not establish a basis to infer scienter such that leave to amend would be warranted, even if discovery was permissible.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Campo\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=371%20Fed.%20Appx.%20212\">\n     371 Fed.
