Another person named Luis Toro was also in Washington's vehicle, seated in the back, right seat of the car behind the front passenger seat.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6.

Heard testified that, after Washington was removed from the vehicle, a police officer ordered Heard to open his door, and once Heard unlocked the door he was pulled from the vehicle and immediately put in handcuffs. Friedman Decl. Ex. B, at 48, 50, 54. Heard could not recall whether there was a center console between the front seats. Friedman Decl. Ex. B, at 52.

Washington testified that there was no center console in the car but that he could not remember if there was anything in the cup holders of the vehicle that night. Friedman Decl. Ex. F, at 49.

That testimony is largely undisputed. Heard testified that he could not recall whether there was a center console between the front seats. Toro testified that he could not see the center console from where he was sitting in the back, right side of the vehicle. And Washington testified that he could not remember if there was anything in the cup holders -- which Officer Roche described as a part of the region where he found the items -- nor could Washington remember whether a gravity knife or pepper spray were inside the vehicle, Officer Roche was therefore entitled to presume that each occupant of the vehicle possessed the knife and the pepper spray.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    People v.

These arguments are unpersuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Heard asserts that Lieutenant Michael Lau, another police officer present at Heard's arrest, delivered several conflicting versions of the events that caused the police to pull over Washington's vehicle, and argues that these conflicting statements by Lieutenant Lau could allow a jury to disbelieve that there was probable cause to stop the vehicle and to disbelieve the entirety of Officer Roche's account of the events of January 19, 2015. But any contradictions in Lieutenant Lau's statements would be immaterial to the issue of whether Officer Roche discovered the gravity knife and the pepper spray in plain view. Although Heard argues in his brief that a reasonable jury could find that there was not probable cause to stop Washington's vehicle, Heard does not allege anywhere in his complaint that the stop of Washington's car was unconstitutional or that the gravity knife and pepper spray were the fruits of an unconstitutional stop. There is no claim in this case for an allegedly unlawful stop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Neither does Heard explain why inconsistencies in Lieutenant Lau's testimony would cause a jury to discredit Officer Roche's account. The only connections Heard draws between Lieutenant Lau's testimony and Officer Roche is that Lieutenant Lau did not observe the gravity knife or pepper spray in the vehicle, did not see if any occupants in Washington's vehicle possessed those items, and did not see if any officers removed the items from the vehicle. That does not call into question whether Officer Roche discovered the gravity knife and pepper spray in plain view when he searched the vehicle. Officer Roche testified that he approached the car along with two other officers who were not Lieutenant Lau, and that he was the only officer to enter the vehicle and subsequently discover the gravity knife and pepper spray in the center console area. Friedman Decl. Ex. D. at 40, 44. Nothing in Lieutenant Lau's testimony undermines Officer Roche's account.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Heard asserts that both he and Toro testified that there were three women in Washington's car on January 19, 2015, while Officer Roche testified that only the three men were occupants when he approached the vehicle. Heard argues that given this dispute, and drawing all ambiguities in his favor, Officer Roche's explanation that he had the authority to arrest everyone in the vehicle is contradicted by the fact that he did not arrest the women. Therefore, Heard argues, a reasonable jury could choose to believe that the automobile presumption does not apply. This dispute is also immaterial. Even assuming that the three women were present, Officer Roche was not obliged to arrest all occupants of the vehicle in order for the automobile presumption to apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Section 265.15 provides that an item's presence in a vehicle justifies an officer in presuming that the item is possessed by all occupants of the vehicle, so long as the item is not plainly possessed by one of the occupants. But nothing in \u00a7 265.15 requires an officer in such a scenario to arrest all occupants of a vehicle.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Penal%20Law%20%C2%A7%20265.15\">\n    N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 265.15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Heard also points to the factual dispute between Officer Roche's testimony that each occupant denied ownership of the knife and pepper spray when they were asked, and the testimony of Heard and Toro that they were never asked about the knife and the pepper spray. Heard argues that given this dispute, a reasonable jury could find that because none of the occupants were asked about the knife and pepper spray, it was unreasonable for Officer Roche to conclude that he had probable cause, pursuant to the automobile presumption, to arrest Heard. This dispute is also immaterial. The automobile presumption does not require that an officer receive, from each occupant, an affirmative denial of ownership before the presumption can be applied. Instead, \u00a7 265.15 creates a permissive presumption of possession with respect to the occupants of a vehicle so long as the items are not \"found upon the person of one of the occupants therein.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Penal%20Law%20%C2%A7%20265.15\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Here, none of the occupants claimed possession of the items. Nor is there any evidence that any of the occupants possessed the items to the exclusion of the others in the car. After establishing probable cause, Officer Roche was not duty bound to ask the occupants whether the items belonged to one of them.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jocks\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9375652\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/316/128/#p135\">\n    316 F.3d at 135-36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"We [do] not impose a duty on the arresting officer to investigate exculpatory defenses offered by the person being arrested ....\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Finally, Heard argues that the fact that there are no existing photos or videos of the vehicle search could indicate to a jury that Officer Roche did not produce any photographs or videos because such evidence would undercut his version of the events leading up to and including Heard's arrest. Heard has not cited to any authority holding that probable cause is negated in the absence of photographs depicting the location of a search. And the fact that video footage of the incident from a nearby taxi stand was apparently not preserved does not conflict with Officer Roche's testimony regarding his search of the vehicle. There is no indication that there is any video footage of the inside of Washington's vehicle as opposed to the vehicle's interaction with the officers in front of the night club. Moreover, an internal investigation report notes that several attempts were made to download the video, but there is no indication of a successful retrieval, and therefore the failure to produce the video does not adversely affect Officer Roche's credibility.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Massimi Decl.
