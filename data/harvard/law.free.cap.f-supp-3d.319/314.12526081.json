BOASBERG, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiff Mahla Dreiband is an Information Technology Specialist with the Department\n   of Homeland Security. In this\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   Title VII suit, she alleges that her employer discriminated against her on the basis of her national origin and disability, retaliated against her for filing a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity office, and subjected her to a hostile work environment. She also seeks to recover damages under the Equal Pay Act, alleging that she was the victim of wage discrimination. Defendant now moves for summary judgment, contending that Plaintiff has offered no material facts to demonstrate that she suffered any adverse employment actions, that she was subjected to discrimination or a hostile work environment, or that she was the target of retaliation. Instead, DHS asserts that the five-day suspension of which she complains had a legitimate, non-discriminatory basis - a physical altercation with another Department employee. Agreeing, and also finding no jurisdiction for her pay claim, the Court will grant the Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Dreiband, whose national origin is Iranian and who suffers from a disability of \"pre-arthritis,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 14 (Amended Complaint), \u00b6\u00b6 11-12, was hired as an IT specialist for DHS in 1989.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 15. Since 2003, she has worked for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which is a component of DHS.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 16. At the time at issue in the Complaint, Plaintiff worked at level GS-2210-12 in ICE's Office of the Chief Information Officer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Exh. B-1 (Report of Investigation) at 22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Between 1998 and 1999, Dreiband worked on the same team as Nancy Luc, another IT specialist with DHS and the woman who, over a decade later, Plaintiff would allege assaulted her in a gym locker room.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl., \u00b6\u00b6 18-20. In 1998, Dreiband filed an EEO Complaint against Luc citing her \"harassment towards Plaintiff.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 13, 18. After requesting reassignment, Dreiband was moved from Luc's team in or around 1999.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Although they were no longer co-workers, Plaintiff and Luc continued to work in the same office building.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 19. On February 7, 2014, the two women found themselves in the locker room of Vida Gym, a facility at which ICE employees have membership.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 27. While the specific facts of what happened in the gym are in dispute, both sides agree that Dreiband and Luc were involved in a physical altercation that resulted in the former being bitten by the latter.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 28-29; ECF No. 20-1 (DSMF), \u00b6 3. The police were called to the scene, and both women were subsequently arrested.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Following this incident, Defendant opened an administrative inquiry, which ultimately led to the suspension of both women.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Exh. G-3 at 168. On July 18, 2014, Plaintiff was issued a notice of a proposed, five-day suspension without pay for engaging in conduct unbecoming a federal employee.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Exh. G-4 at 171. Dreiband responded to the proposed suspension via her attorney on August 7, 2014, stating that the penalty should not be sustained because \"Ms. Dreiband was the innocent victim of a malicious attack by Ms. Luc.\" ECF No. 20-9 (Response to Proposed Suspension). That October, the Acting Chief Information Officer, Steven Smith, issued a decision sustaining the charges and the penalty, finding that the \"alleged misconduct [was] supported by a preponderance of the evidence.\" Def. Exh. G-6 at 189. Plaintiff served her five-day suspension from October 9 to October 13, and Luc served hers from November 7 to November 11.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DSMF, \u00b6\u00b6 11-12. Dreiband\n   alleges that \"[f]ollowing the attack,\" Luc \"told numerous coworkers and supervisors\" that Plaintiff had initiated the fight at the gym.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl., \u00b6 36. Although Dreiband states that she complained to management about such statements, she asserts that her supervisors did not intervene.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 37.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The next relevant incident occurred on May 2, 2014, when an ICE manager sent Plaintiff, as the property custodian for her office, an email identifying missing government property.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Exh. G-12 at 242. Dreiband responded that she had located the assets,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 244, but Leonard Pulley, the Chief of the Network and Infrastructure Services Branch, replied that the inventory had in fact been located by two other individuals and that two items remained missing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 242-43. Plaintiff in turn responded that she was confused about Pulley's characterization, but he did not reply to that email.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 242.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The same day, Plaintiff received her Fiscal Year 2014 mid-year performance evaluation. Dreiband's supervisor gave her a rating of \"fully satisfactory\" for the elements of technical proficiency, customer service, project management, and information-systems security.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Exh. G-10 at 215-25. For the element of teamwork, cooperation, and collaboration, however, Plaintiff's evaluation stated that she \"ha[d] much room for improvement,\" noting that she was \"involved in an altercation in early FY14 with another ICE ... employee\" and that she had been counseled on two separate occasions regarding management policy and guidance.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 222-23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Procedural History\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On October 20, 2014, Plaintiff contacted an EEO Counselor regarding her suspension and treatment after the gym altercation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Exh. B-1 at 22. Three months later, ICE notified Dreiband that her counseling had concluded and informed her of her right to file a formal complaint, a step she took on January 28, 2015.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Exh. A-1 at 17-19. Plaintiff's complaint was filed with ICE's Office of Diversity and Civil Rights (ODCR) and presented the following claim: ICE discriminated against her and subjected her to a hostile work environment based on national origin, religion, age, disability, and reprisal when (1) a co-worker physically attacked Plaintiff; (2) during an internal investigation of the incident, the co-worker made false statements about Dreiband's work performance and told the investigator that Plaintiff was moved to a different office fifteen years prior; (3) management issued Dreiband an unfavorable mid-year review and accused her of inappropriate accounting for government property; and (4) Plaintiff was suspended for five days.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Exhs. C-2 at 97, C-3 at 102.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In August 2015, ODCR provided Dreiband with a Report of Investigation (ROI) and ultimately the final agency decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Exhs. D (Notice Letter), E (FAD Request). She responded by filing suit in this Court on May 12, 2017. Dreiband's Amended Complaint, which was filed in March 2018, alleged three grounds for relief under Title VII - national-origin discrimination, hostile work environment, and retaliation - and three others under the Rehabilitation Act - disability discrimination, retaliation, and hostile-work environment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl., \u00b6 1. Plaintiff also alleged, although she did not include any relevant count, that her action sought to \"recover damages\" under the Equal Pay Act.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 2. DHS now moves to dismiss or, in the alternative, for summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Legal Standard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   As the Court considers the Motion under the summary-judgment standard, it\n   sets out that one alone.

Specifically, Plaintiff's allegations that she was discriminated against when she received a negative performance appraisal, when she was \"accused of inappropriate accounting\" of government inventory, and when her co-worker made negative statements about her past performance do not constitute adverse actions under Title VII. Dreiband offers no evidence that any of these acts resulted in a change in her benefits, responsibilities, or job title, and they therefore cannot provide the basis for her discrimination count.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Baloch v.

The question for the Court is thus whether a jury could find that this suspension was the result of discrimination. Because DHS has asserted a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the action - namely, Dreiband's involvement in the gym altercation - the Court need only consider whether Plaintiff \"produced evidence sufficient for a reasonable jury to find that the employer's stated reason was not the actual reason and that the employer intentionally discriminated\n   against [Dreiband] based on\" her national origin or disability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3569076,3701580\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/520/490/\">\n    520 F.3d at 495\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Plaintiff here has not produced any direct evidence of discriminatory intent behind her suspension, nor has she proffered any other evidence that discredits the Department's stated rationale. Her Complaint may allege that \"management has never disciplined an employee who was not Iranian [and] did not have disabilities ... for being physically attacked by a co-worker,\" Compl., \u00b6 35, but she presents no record support for this claim nor any other facts supporting an inference that her national origin or disability gave rise to the suspension. The Letter of Suspension, moreover, makes clear that Dreiband's penalty was for \"conduct unbecoming an agency employee\" - namely, being \"involved in a physical altercation.\" ECF No. 20-10, (Def. Exh. G-6) at 189. The Court notes, moreover, that Luc was\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   given a five-day suspension after the gym incident, and that she is not Iranian.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Exh. F-3 (Witness Affidavit of Nancy Luc), at 133-34. In sum, given the dearth of record evidence in support of Plaintiff's claim that the suspension was the result of discriminatory animus, rather than her conduct at the gym, the Court concludes that no reasonable jury could find that Dreiband was discriminated against in violation of Title VII or the Rehabilitation Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Retaliation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In addition to alleging discrimination, Plaintiff also claims that she was retaliated against in violation of Title VII and the Rehabilitation Act.

Such general assertions of \"harassment\" do not suffice to make out a hostile-work-environment claim.
