One of the things they needed was\n   3/4\u2033 thick, 4\u2032 by 8\u2032 oriented strand board (\"OSB\"), similar to particle board. They rented a Menard's pickup truck, drove it into the lumber shed, and began selecting and loading sheets of OSB. In the process, Mr. McCarty fell and injured himself, breaking his upper arm. He claims that he tripped over a product display sign that was in front of the pile of OSB to the right of the pile he and Mr. Parks were getting their sheets from. Mr. McCarty filed a lawsuit against Menard's, charging it with negligence for having the display sign in a public area, thereby causing a tripping hazard, and failing to keep its premises in a reasonably safe condition. [Dkt. # 6, \u00b6 5]. Menard's has moved for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    SUMMARY JUDGMENT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    Fed.R.Civ.P. 56\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Summary judgment is appropriate \"if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.

[Dkt. # 55, \u00b6 8]. Despite the straight forward nature of the statement, the response is a four-page breakdown of the store and the managerial hierarchy. [Dkt. # 62, at pp. 2-6]. While Mr. McCarty does manage to admit that Menard's operates the store where he tripped, the response is not the \"concise response\" that Local Rule 56.1(b)(3) demands. This is not, unfortunately, an isolated example; rather, Mr. McCarty's responsive filing continues in that vein throughout. If Menard's states, uncontroversially, that Mr. McCarty and his employee were shopping for materials at the store on February 13, 2017 [Dkt. # 55, \u00b6 11], Mr. McCarty needlessly responds by detailing the entire process from renting a truck driving through a certain gate, at a specific time of day and so forth. [Dkt. # 62, \u00b6\u00b6 11-12]. Simple sentences are met with paragraphs of response. One example (there are many others) should suffice to demonstrate the format. When Menard's asserts - correctly in light of the record - that its store general manager, Naushad Kazi, testified that he routinely patrols the outside yard himself [Dkt. # 55, \u00b6 54], Mr. McCarty responded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   Kazi did state that he supervises the entire store including the outside yard and he would do so by walking the yard. He did not use the word \"patrol\" in his testimony. Moreover, on February 13, 2017 he did not walk in the outside yard prior to the Plaintiff's injury despite the fact that he arrived at either 7:00 a.m. or 8:00 a.m. for work on February 13. (Ex. E, pgs. 53, 60) None of the other Assistant General Managers or the YSR Department Manager or assistant YSR department managers testified that they walked through the east barn before Plaintiffs injury. (Ex. J, pg. 30; Ex. K, pgs. 62-63; Ex. L, pg. 57, Ex. U, pg. 28) )\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   In addition, Menards Policies and Procedures No. 8473 states that a To Do list for the YSR department is to be utilized daily. (Ex. R) The To Do form for the YSR department specifically requires \"The below tasks must be completed every day\" which tasks include \"Safety Inspection been completed and any identified issues fixed, such as trip hazards.\" (Ex. M, pg. 96, Ex. R) Kazi does not know if the Outside Yard's To Do list was done on February 13, 2017 but if it was completed and turned in to the General Manager's basket as procedure required, it was thrown away the next day. (Ex. M, pgs. 100-102) It was thrown away by Kazi despite the To Do form further stating \"This form should be kept in the 1-31 file for 90 days.\" (Ex. R) Second Assistant General Manager Omar Castadeda testified that this was a breach of Menards Policies and Procedures by not maintaining the Outside Yard's (YSR) To Do lists for the required 90 days.(Ex. J, pg. 14)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   As to the safety inspection required for the Outside Yard by Menards Policies and Procedures 8473 (Ex. R), Kazi testified that there are no safety inspections\n   for tripping hazards done for the Antioch Outside Yard department. (Ex. M, pg. 106) First Assistant General Manager Josh Parr agreed there are no safety inspections of the outside barn. (Ex. J, pg. 114) Second Assistant YSR Manager Ryan Lannert testified that there is \"no inspection procedure set up by Menards for the outside barn or sheds to ensure that there is no tripping hazards.\" (Ex. L, pg. 72)\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   [Dkt. # 62, \u00b6 54].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   A 380-word response to a seven-word, uncomplicated factual assertion is, in this case, inappropriate. Whether the prolixity is intentional or not - as it sometimes is to obfuscate the facts in order that summary judgment will be denied,\n   <em>\n    Dynegy Mktg. &amp; Trade v. Multiut Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3741010\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/648/506/#p513\">\n    648 F.3d 506\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 513 (7th Cir. 2011) - we need not decide. Regardless of the motive in this case, Mr. McCarty's responses are anything but concise as the Local Rule requires. That the lack of concision makes analysis more difficult. We do not mean to question the good faith of the plaintiff's capable lawyer. Quite the contrary. His dedication to his client's interests is beyond reproach. The point rather is to illustrate how non-compliance with the Local Rule makes decision more difficult than it would be had there been compliance with the Local Rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   When Menard's objected to these violations of the Local Rule, Mr. McCarty's counsel conceded that he had failed to follow the Rule and sought to correct what he described as his misunderstanding of it. His counsel said he thought he was supposed to include his additional facts in his responses to Menard's asserted facts, despite the fact that the Rule says that there is to be a responsive statement and a statement of additional facts. Local Rule 56.1(b)(3)(B) and (C). There then followed a separate, five-page statement of 39 additional facts, all of which were short and concise. [Dkt. # 65]. As already noted, when a party fails to comply with Local Rule 56.1's directions regarding a response to a statement of facts, courts have discretion to deem the facts admitted. In the main, courts have followed that approach when parties fail to make their responses concise.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Vacation Rental Partners, LLC v.

Although Mr. McCarty has chosen to allow his 30-page \"statement\" to stand as his response, he has also filed a compliant statement of additional facts, and so there is something appropriate to consider against Menard's version. And we do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS OF THE CASE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Robert McCarty and his employee, Tristan Parks, went to the Antioch Menard's to pick up, among other items, some OSB. They rented a Menard's truck, drove it into the lumber shed, and located the OSB they wanted. The material was stacked, horizontally, by size, in a number of side-by-side piles. Mr. McCarty testified that they found the OSB they wanted by looking for the display signs in front of the piles and locating the one for 3/4 inch OSB. [Dkt. # 55-1, at 102].\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   the photograph\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   , of Mr. McCarty taken immediately after his fall. Mr. Parks said the same thing. The signs in front of the piles of OSB reflected the type of material and price. [Dkt. # 55-2, at 57-58]. A Menard's employee asked if they needed assistance; he was helping other customers and indicated\n   he'd return. Mr. McCarty and Mr. Parks waited for a bit, and then decided to move the boards themselves to adjacent piles until they would come upon the boards they wanted. [Dkt # 55, \u00b6\u00b6 11-20].\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   For one reason or another, the top few boards and the 3/4\u2033 stack weren't desirable, so the two men began sliding those over to the stacks on the right and left of the 3/4\u2033 stack which was in the middle. In doing so, Mr. McCarty would lift a board of a size and type that did not match the type he wanted and move to his right and place it on the adjacent stack. His employee, Mr. Parks, did the same except he would move to his left and place the noncompliant board on the stack on the left. Alternating between the two of them, Mr. McCarty moving sheets to the right and Mr. Parks moving sheets to the left, they moved five or six boards over to neighboring stacks. As Mr. McCarty explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   I moved the sheets from the center pile that were stacked on top of the 3/4 to the right. [Mr. Parks] moved the sheets that were stacked on top of the center pile to the right [sic].... I was doing\n   <em>\n    one side\n   </em>\n   , he was doing\n   <em>\n    the other\n   </em>\n   .... I would pick up the sheet and slide it over the top of the stack and move it over to that side and\n   <em>\n    then come back\n   </em>\n   and pick up another sheet and slide it over, move it over - -\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   [Dkt. # 55-1, at 108-09] (Emphasis supplied).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   After\n   <em>\n    several\n   </em>\n   such moves, Mr. McCarty said he adjusted the top sheet in the pile he had moved the sheets to so that it was out of the way of the pile they wanted. [Dkt # 55-1, at 119-20]. He then \"\n   <em>\n    went back\n   </em>\n   and that's when [he] tripped on the 2-by or whatever it is on the bottom of the sign ....\" [Dkt # 55-1, at 110] (Emphasis supplied).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   It bears repeating, as the testimony revealed, that plaintiff and Mr. Parks were moving respectively to their left and right as they were moving boards from the middle stack to those on the adjacent stacks. It was during this process that Mr. McCarty said he tripped over the display sign in front of the right hand pile. [Dkt. # 55, \u00b6 41; Dkt. ## 55-1, at 109]. The display signs are supported by a pair of 2-by-4s that, ideally, slide under the stack of OSBs so that the sign, indicating the product and price, is flush against the front of the pile. [Dkt. # 55-4]. At his deposition, Mr. McCarty explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   A: Yes. I tripped over that - that piece of wood that's part of the sign.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   Q: That sign that has the price on it and the dimensions on it?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   A: Yes, it's like a 2-by that sticks underneath the stacks of plywood, OSB.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   Q: It can. And on this day it was not.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   [Dkt. # 55-1, at 109]. Mr. McCarty went on to describe his recollection of the signs:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   I saw the signs that were in place. I was focused on my 3/4-inch plywood and moving the material either side. That's what we did and then I went back and that's when I tripped on that 2-by or whatever it is at the bottom of the sign and hit my arm on top of the plywood either here or here. I can't remember where I hit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   Q: Either you pulled the sign out or was the sign out when you started?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   A: I did not pull the sign out.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   Q: So it was there when you started?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   A:\n   <em>\n    I did not see the sign sitting there like that.\n   </em>\n   I walked up focused on this 3/4-inch and I didn't know that I had any material on top of there that wasn't going to be 3/4-inch and I\n   started moving it over to the right focusing on the 3/4-inch. I wasn't looking behind me.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   [Dkt. # 55-1, at 110] (Emphasis supplied).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   So, according to Mr. McCarty, he didn't see the sign wasn't flush with the pile on the right that he has been moving OSB to because he was so focused on the OSB. [Dkt. # 55-1, at 111]. He said had he seen it, he wouldn't have tripped over it. [Dkt. # 55-1, at 134].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Mr. Parks also confirmed the process of moving the OSB, which involved lateral movements by Mr. Park and Mr. McCarty:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   A. We're standing next to each other, so, you know, he's on a section - he's on a section, so I'll grab and lift and move It. (Indicating.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   Q: Okay.\n   <em>\n    So you moved about\n   </em>\n   \u00b7\u00b7 you're showing us\n   <em>\n    you moved about two or three paces from - to your left every time you picked one up?\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   A:\n   <em>\n    Sure\n   </em>\n   , I mean, I don't know how many paces, how many steps I took from - I wasn't counting my steps, so how -\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   Q: You're certainly not standing -\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   MR.

Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   [Dkt. # 55-2, at 62-63] (Emphasis supplied). Mr. Parks doesn't know how Mr. McCarty fell. He \"believed\" Mr. McCarty tripped over the display sign in front of the pile on the right side of the 3/4\u2033 pile. [Dkt. # 55-2, at 69]. As Mr. Parks testified at his deposition:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   Q: ... You don't know for sure?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   A: Correct -\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   Q: Got it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   A: - because I was moving a piece of wood at the time of the fall.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   Q: Okay. So you're kind of looking to the left?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   A: Right.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   Q: Did not see him tumble?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   A: I saw the end of the tumble, him trying to like reach out and break his fall.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   [Dkt. # 55-2, at 70].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   After Mr. McCarty had fallen, Mr. Parks saw that the sign was askew - it was pulled out from under the stack of OSB, rather than flush against the stack like the other signs. [Dkt. # 55-2, at 76-77]. That's why Mr. Parks thought Mr. McCarty tripped over the sign. [Dkt. # 55-2, at 77]. He doesn't know whether Mr. McCarty moved the sign, or whether it moved during his fall, or whether it was askew before the fall. [Dkt. # 55-2, at 70-71]. Mr. Parks says he took pictures - including the one below - of the site within 10 seconds after Mr. McCarty had fallen. [Dkt. # 55-2, at 81].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   So, how did the sign get out of place? If one can learn anything from the 1500 or so pages of deposition transcripts the parties have amassed about how Mr. McCarty fell, it's that no one knows. Mr. McCarty's main focus in this regard is the testimony of the second assistant manager of the lumber shed, Ryan Lannert. Testimony from Mr. Lannert's deposition provides a good example of the evidence accumulated in this trip-and-fall case. Mr. Lannert was questioned at length regarding any number of things, including how he thought the sign might have been moved. First was plaintiff's counsel:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   Q: By the way, do you know how long this sign that's shown in the foreground of [the photo included above] was out like that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   A: Oh, I don't know.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   Q: Do you know what caused it to be out?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   A: I do not.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   Q: Okay. You don't have any clue as to how it got out there?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   A: Correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   [Dkt. 62-12, at 56-57]. Plaintiff's counsel circled back around after a while, with similar results:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   Q: Okay, Did anybody ever tell you how the sign had gotten out?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   A: No.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   Q: Okay. So I take it you have no idea how that sign got out?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   A: No.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   [Dkt. # 62-12, at 80-81]. Plaintiff's counsel went on to ask whether there were inspections for tripping hazards, and Mr. Lannert said they were done every day. When a hazard was found, it was corrected \"right\n   away\"; no report was made of it. [Dkt. # 62-12, at 95]. No one particular employee was assigned to do this; it was expected of all employees. [Dkt. # 62-12, at 95, 115]. Counsel again asked whether Mr. Lannert knew how long the sign was askew and he again said he did not. [Dkt. # 62-12, at 95]. He asked again whether Mr. Lannert knew how the sign got out and, again, Mr. Lannert said he didn't. [Dkt. # 62-12, at 104]. Plaintiff's counsel asked whether a Menard's employee could have left the sign out, and Mr. Lannert allowed that that was possible. [Dkt. # 62-12, at 104]. He testified it was easy to move the signs; they could be pushed with your foot. [Dkt. # 62-12, at 111].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Then it was defense counsel's turn:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-100\">\n   Q: .... directing your attention to the sign that is pushed out or pulled out from a flush position as depicted in [the photo], you don't know how that came to be, right?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   A: Correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n   Q: You didn't see it, so you have no idea -\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n   A: Correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-104\">\n   Q: - how in this case on that day this happened?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n   A: Correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   [Dkt. # 62-12, at 118]. Again, Mr. Lannert testified, for perhaps the eighth time, that\n   <em>\n    he didn't know\n   </em>\n   how the sign became askew. But, defense counsel was unsatisfied and persisted:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-107\">\n   Q: Do you know that this guest did it?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-108\">\n   A: I do not know.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-109\">\n   Q: Do you know if a team member did it -\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-110\">\n   A: I do not know.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-111\">\n   Q: - or if another guest did it?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-112\">\n   A: Can't recall.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   [Dkt. # 62-12, at 118]. Defense counsel, however, was still not satisfied and pressed on:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-114\">\n   Q: Is it likely that a team member left a sign out like this or didn't push a sign in like this -\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-115\">\n   Plaintiff's counsel: Object.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-116\">\n   BY Defense counsel: - depicted in this photograph where it's about 18 inches askew like that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-117\">\n   Plaintiff's counsel: Objection. No foundation for this.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-118\">\n   A: It's possible.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-119\">\n   BY defense counsel: The question was: is it likely?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-120\">\n   Plaintiff's counsel: Objection. No foundation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-121\">\n   A: Yes. It is likely.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-122\">\n   Q: Why is it likely?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-123\">\n   A: I can't think of a reason.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   [Dkt. # 62-12, at 118-19]. Mr. Lannert went on to explain that the only reason an employee would move a sign out is if they adjusted the stacks of boards - called \"down stocking\" - and got lazy and didn't replace the sign. [Dkt. # 62-12, at 119].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   But, there's no\n   <em>\n    evidence\n   </em>\n   that there was any down stocking on February 13\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   . Deposition testimony from another store employee, Zachary Anderson, indicates that, at least at the beginning of the day, the sign was in place:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-126\">\n   Q: Okay. Could that sign have been out, as shown in 1C, when you walked around with Tommy that day?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-127\">\n   A: Not first thing in the morning.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-128\">\n   Q: Why not?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-129\">\n   A: Because the yard was clean.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-130\">\n   Q: Okay. What do you mean by \"the yard was clean\"?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-131\">\n   A: Everything was 100 percent.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-132\">\n   Q: Okay. So the yard - the sign sticking out in 1C and 1D, that would not be 100 percent?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-133\">\n   A: No.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-134\">\n   Q: Am I correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-135\">\n   A: That is correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   [Dkt. # 55-6; at 136-37]. The walkaround was done about 5 a.m. [Dkt. # 55-6, at 138].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   After that, it's anyone's guess how the sign got moved. Again, Mr. Lannert didn't know how the sigh was moved, and could only guess that it might have been an employee if the employee had been down-stocking. Mr. Anderson said he had occasionally seen customers move floor stack signs, but he had never seen an employee move a sign the way the sign in this case was moved. [Dkt. # 55-6, at 161]. Testimony from Menard's employees - of varying levels - was uniform in that, if an employee saw a sign out of place, a tripping hazard, they would replace it. Naushad Kazi, the store's general manager, said if he saw a sign out of place he'd push it in. [Dkt. # 55-5, at 137]. Mr. Anderson said if he'd seen a sign askew, he'd push it back in place. [Dkt. # 55-6, at 163]. Tommy Shelvin, the outside yard manager, testified that if he saw a sign out of place, he would point it out and a team member would put it back. [Dkt. # 62-11, at 122]. Mr. Lannert said this was a daily expectation of all employees. [Dkt. # 62-12, at 115].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   As the parties agree, Illinois law provides the substantive law in this diversity action.

The four factors courts typically consider in determining whether a duty exists are: (1) the reasonable foreseeability of\n   injury; (2) the likelihood of injury; (3) the magnitude of the burden of guarding against injury; and (4) the consequences of placing that burden on the defendant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266145\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/880/899/#p905\">\n    880 F.3d at 906\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   The \"open and obvious\" doctrine, however, is an exception to the general duty of care owed by a landowner, because persons who own, occupy, or control and maintain land are not ordinarily required to foresee and protect against injuries from potentially dangerous conditions that are open and obvious.\n   <em>\n    Dunn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266145\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/880/899/#p905\">\n    880 F.3d at 906\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

[Dkt. # 61, at 15]. But that's not exactly accurate and, more to the point, it doesn't exactly matter. According to both men, as they drove into the lumber shed, they looked at the signs in front of all the piles of materials as they passed. They had to, because as they testified they were looking at the piles and signs to find the size of OSB that they wanted. So they saw the signs and, at least, saw that they were in front of each stack of materials. Further, as both men testified, they set about removing the first several sheets of OSB in the middle stack to the left and right to get down to the ones (in the middle stack) they found desirable. As they did so, they moved from the target stack to the stacks on either side. So, Mr. McCarty was, at the very least, right next to the sign he tripped on for however long it took to find the right boards. The signs in front of the three stacks of lumber involved were identical in size and shape. They were about knee high, and the legs were at least 4 inches wide. Yet, Mr. McCarty argues he didn't see the sign over which he tripped.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   Mr. Parks specifically testified that they stepped from the target pile (in the middle) over to the piles on the side as they moved the undesirable sheets. Mr. McCarty wasn't as specific, but he did not contradict what Mr. Parks had said. Quite the contrary. He said that after he moved each sheet from the target pile to the pile on the right, he would \"\n   <em>\n    then come back\n   </em>\n   and pick up another sheet and slide it over, move it over ....\" [Dkt. # 55-1, at 108-09](Emphasis supplied). The evidence reflects that Mr. McCarty saw and negotiated the legs of the sign several times before he tripped. Moreover, unless he was gazing off into the distance, given the height of the piles shown in the included photograph,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 13, he would have been looking down as he moved the sheets, even if he were standing in one spot and flinging them sideways - which he wasn't. As he said, he was \"focused\" on the piles and moving sheets from one to the other. [Dkt. # 55-1, at 110].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   While it's difficult to believe that, given all this, Mr. McCarty never saw the protruding sign, it doesn't matter whether he saw it or not. True, a court can't make a credibility determination in a summary judgment proceeding.\n   <em>\n    Orton-Bell\n   </em>\n   , 759 F.3d at 773. But, in this context,\n   \"obvious\" is objectively determined. \"Thus, the determination of whether the condition is open and obvious depends not on plaintiff's subjective knowledge but, rather, on the objective knowledge of a reasonable person confronted with the same condition.\"\n   <em>\n    Racky v.

Here, even drawing reasonable inferences - as opposed to every conceivable inference,\n   <em>\n    Spitz\n   </em>\n   , 759 F.3d at 730 - in Mr. McCarty's favor, it has to be said as a matter of law that the tripping hazard of the sign was open and obvious. A reasonable person in Mr. McCarty's position, who saw that there were signs, chose the stack he wanted by looking at the signs, walked right up to the signs, was working within a few feet of the protruding sign, and either repeatedly stepped over it or turned toward it, would have noticed the large sign and legs as a tripping hazard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   For this same reason, Mr. McCarty's assertion that the store's general manager, Mr. Kazi, didn't see the protruding sign until it was pointed out [Dkt. # 61, at 15] to him is unavailing. Again, the standard is the reasonable person in the plaintiff's position. Mr. Kazi testified that he didn't see the sign \"the minute [he] first got in [the lumber shed].\" [Dkt. # 55-5, at 131-32]. At that time he didn't know what had happened and, so, he only saw the sign when he was told Mr. McCarty tripped over it. [Dkt. # 55-5, at 132]. Mr. McCarty, as we know, was right next to the sign for a period of time, and either repeatedly stepped over its legs or, at least, repeatedly turned toward it, as he moved sheets of OSB to the pile on his right.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   That's all Mr. McCarty has to offer on the open and obvious doctrine. [Dkt. # 61, at 15], and its clearly insufficient to withstand summary judgment. That being the case, Mr. McCarty falls back on the \"distraction exception.\" [Dkt. # 61, at 16]. \"The distraction exception applies where the possessor [of land] has reason to expect that the invitee's attention may be distracted, so that he will not discover what is obvious, or will forget what he has discovered, or fail to protect himself against it.\"\n   <em>\n    Bruns v.

Here, Mr. McCarty argues that he was distracted by moving the boards from one pile to the other. [Dkt. # 61, at 16]. But there is nothing in the record to suggest that Menard's had reason to expect invitees would move merchandise from one stack to another and disregard an obvious tripping hazard. Indeed, McCarty does not even argue this in his brief. [Dkt. # 61, at 15-16]. Moreover, in\n   <em>\n    Bruns\n   </em>\n   , where the plaintiff claimed her attention was focused on steps and a door as she walked and tripped on an uneven part of a sidewalk, the Illinois Supreme Court made it clear that \"the mere fact of looking elsewhere does not constitute a distraction.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266145\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/880/899/#p905\">\n    880 F.3d at 909\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   Mr. McCarty suggests that the fact that he was involved in a task - as opposed to merely looking elsewhere - constitutes a distraction. Mr. McCarty doesn't cite a case, other than\n   <em>\n    Bruns\n   </em>\n   , in support of this theory [Dkt. # 61, at 16], but\n   <em>\n    Bruns\n   </em>\n   rejected the position that a plaintiff was distracted by focusing on steps and a door and not looking down at where she was walking.\n   <em>\n    Bruns\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=386%20Ill.%20Dec.%20765\">\n    386 Ill.Dec. 765\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20N.E.3d%20684\">\n    21 N.E.3d at 694\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Significantly, the plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Bruns\n   </em>\n   did not\n   negotiate the flaw in the sidewalk multiple times or even once. She didn't stand next to the flaw in the sidewalk for any period of time before tripping on it. And, the flaw in the sidewalk was not connected to a large, knee-high sign. Here, Mr. McCarty admittedly was right next to the sign for a period of time; he either walked over the legs of the sign several times or at least once, as he admitted, before tripping over it. And, again, the obstacle was far more apparent and obvious than an uneven bit of sidewalk.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   Finally,\n   <em>\n    Bruns\n   </em>\n   also stated that the distraction exception is only applicable \"where evidence exists from which a court can infer that plaintiff was actually distracted.\"\n   <em>\n    Bruns\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=386%20Ill.%20Dec.%20765\">\n    386 Ill.Dec. 765\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20N.E.3d%20684\">\n    21 N.E.3d at 691\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The evidence here - Mr. McCarty's own testimony - points the other way. According to him, he was finished moving the OSB boards and had nothing in his hands when he tripped. [Dkt # 55-1, at 110, 119-20]. His purportedly distracting task was complete. Perhaps the reason Mr. McCarty fails to cite any \"task\" cases is because such cases have nothing to do with his spill at Menard's.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rexroad v.

Moreover, the plaintiff's suggestion of constant and continuous surveillance is not only impractical, but to impose such a burden would tend to take premises liability into the realm of strict liability, and that's a bridge too far.

But, it is worth pointing out that, for many of the reasons already discussed, neither can Mr. McCarty succeed on the element of proximate cause. There are two requirements a plaintiff must meet to establish proximate cause. The defendant's conduct must be an actual cause of the plaintiff's injury, and it must be a legal cause as well.\n   <em>\n    Simmons v.

On this point, Mr. McCarty relies entirely on the testimony of Mr. Lannert [Dkt. # 61, at 11], who stated - when repeatedly pressed - it was likely a Menard's employee was responsible\n   <em>\n    only if\n   </em>\n   there had been down stocking. And there is no evidence of when there was down stocking, if there was at all. Importantly, the evidence is that the sign was in place on the morning of the day Mr. McCarty tripped and there is no evidence down stocking occurred on that day. Another employee, Mr. Anderson, had seen customers move signs in the past. Anyone, customer or employee, could have moved the sign.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   Mr. McCarty tripped over an open and obvious hazard - and one that he successfully\n   negotiated before he fell.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 11 and 20. At the very least, he stepped over its legs once before tripping and falling. (His employee swore that they had moved the boards from pile to pile at least five or six times). But, in any event, once is enough under the circumstances of this case. When he tripped, Mr. McCarty wasn't carrying anything that might obscure his vision, as he already had finished moving boards to the right and was returning to the middle pile. There is no evidence to show that a Menard's employee had left the sign askew. It bears repeating that \"speculation or conjecture regarding the cause of an injury is not sufficient in Illinois to impose liability for negligence.\"\n   <em>\n    Piotrowski\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12138672\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/842/1035/#p1038\">\n    842 F.3d at 1038\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Mr. McCarty hasn't presented any such evidence. Moreover, Mr. McCarty doesn't cite a single case to support his theory of liability. [Dkt. # 61, at 9-17]. That failure often results in a waiver,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thornton v.

While it is true that Mr. Parks later testified that he wasn't watching Mr. McCarty and didn't know if he took one, two or three steps [Dkt. # 55-2, at 110], given Mr. Parks' testimony cited here, it's a mischaracterization of the record to say that neither man testified that Mr. McCarty stepped to the right as he moved his sheets. Moreover, in the portion of Mr. McCarty's testimony cited in the Statement of Additional Facts, Mr. McCarty said each time he moved a sheet, he would then \"come back and pick up another sheet ....\" [Dkt. # 55-1, at 108-09]. That certainly does not rule out stepping from stack to stack. Quite the contrary.
