CHUTKAN, United States District Judge\n   Before the court are the United States' Petition and Amended Petition for Summary Enforcement of Inspector General Subpoena, and Respondent's Motion to Quash, or in the Alternative, for a Protective Order. For the reasons stated below, the court will GRANT in part and DENY in part the United States' petitions and Respondent's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In January 2018, the United States Department of Justice Office of the Inspector General (\"OIG\") initiated an investigation into alleged misconduct by Federal Bureau of Prisons (\"BOP\") \"employees in connection with a BOP contract award.\" ECF No. 2-1 (Declaration of Greg Thompson, \"Thompson Decl.\") \u00b6 3. Pursuant to this investigation, the OIG requested that Respondent Donna M. Hill-an Executive Assistant at the BOP-produce the BOP-owned Samsung mobile telephone (hereinafter, \"Samsung phone\") and Microsoft Surface Pro Tablet (hereinafter, \"Microsoft tablet\") issued to her in connection with her employment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 4, 6. The OIG has reason to believe that these electronic devices contain communications relevant to its investigation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Despite the issuance of two administrative subpoenas requesting the immediate production of the Samsung phone and Microsoft tablet to the OIG, Respondent refused to produce the electronic devices, asserting that she was entitled to withhold the devices because personal information is stored on them.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 6, 7, 9, 16. She maintained this position even after the OIG sent an email to her counsel, explaining that the BOP warned her that she had no expectation of privacy while operating the electronic devices.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10-13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On February 16, 2018, the government filed a Petition for Summary Enforcement of Inspector General Subpoena, requesting that the court order Respondent to immediately produce the BOP-owned electronic devices pursuant to the OIG administrative subpoenas. ECF No. 1 (Gov't Pet.). A week later, the government filed a Motion for Temporary Restraining Order. ECF No. 2. Under the terms of the government's proposed temporary restraining order, Respondent would be required to immediately produce the BOP-issued devices, but the government would be prohibited from searching the devices until the government's Petition for Summary Enforcement was resolved or a search warrant was properly obtained. ECF No. 2-3 at 2. Respondent then filed a Motion to Quash, or in the Alternative, for Protective Order, arguing that because she has a constitutionally protected right to her personal information on the electronic devices, she did not have to comply with the OIG's subpoenas. ECF No. 5 (Respondent Mot.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On March 16, 2018, this court entered a Temporary Restraining Order, concluding that (1) the United States was likely to succeed on the merits of its Petition for Summary Enforcement, (2) Respondent's continued withholding of the electronic devices would likely result in irreparable and serious damage to the OIG's investigation, (3) Respondent's alleged\n   Fourth Amendment rights would not be violated as a result of a temporary restraining order because the OIG was temporarily prohibited from searching the devices, and (4) the public interest favored entry of the Order. ECF No. 7 (TRO) at 3-4. The court ordered Respondent to immediately produce the Samsung phone and Microsoft tablet to Senior Special Agent Greg Thompson or any other OIG Special Agent.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4. The court also ordered the OIG to \"refrain from taking any action with respect to the devices, including any action to physically or remotely search the devices or otherwise physically or remotely access the devices for any purpose\" until further order of the court or until a search warrant was properly obtained.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On April 27, 2018, the OIG learned that Respondent maintained possession of a third BOP-issued device-a Blackberry mobile telephone (hereinafter, \"Blackberry\"). ECF No. 17-1 (Second Supplemental Declaration of Greg Thompson, \"Second Suppl. Thompson Decl.\") \u00b6 2. The OIG has reason to believe that the Blackberry also contains communications relevant to its investigation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4. Accordingly, on May 9, 2018, the OIG e-mailed a subpoena to Respondent's counsel-whom has maintained possession of the Blackberry since February 14, 2018-requesting production of the Blackberry \"FORTHWITH.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 2-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Respondent refused to produce the Blackberry absent the OIG's agreement not to search it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 19 (Respondent Notice) at 1. Unwilling to enter into such an agreement, the government filed an Amended Petition for Summary Enforcement of Inspector General Subpoena and for Expedited Ruling. ECF No. 17 (Gov't Am. Pet.). In the Amended Petition, the government asks the court to order Respondent to produce her Blackberry and permit the government to search all three BOP-issued devices.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8. The parties rely on the briefing submitted in support of or in opposition to the government's initial Petition to Enforce (ECF No. 1) to support and oppose the Amended Petition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 16 (May 22, 2018 Order),\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Respondent Notice at 1, 3.\n  </p>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <p id=\"p-16\">\n    <strong>\n     II. DISCUSSION\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-17\">\n    The court's role \"in a proceeding to enforce an administrative subpoena is a strictly limited one.\"\n    <em>\n     FTC v.

The court is to determine whether \" 'the inquiry is within the authority of the agency, the demand is not too indefinite and the information sought is reasonably relevant' \" to the agency's investigation.\n    <em>\n     United States Int'l Trade Comm'n v.

The Subpoenas Are Not Too Indefinite\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-20\">\n    Respondent argues that the subpoenas are too indefinite because they \"describe[ ] a general investigation into employee misconduct\" and \"[n]othing more.\" Respondent Mot. at 6. She further argues that the subpoenas fail to reveal whether she \"is a 'subject,' 'target,' or 'witness' \" in the investigation.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"962043,3526355\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/555/862/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    Because \"there are no bounds, no direction and no limits to the government's subpoena request[s],\" Respondent argues, the subpoenas are unenforceable.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 6-7. The court disagrees.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-21\">\n    The OIG's subpoena requests are sufficiently defined and limited. They seek the production of three BOP-owned devices from one employee for one specific investigation: \"an investigation into allegations of misconduct by an employee(s) of the Department of Justice.\" ECF No. 2-2; ECF No. 17-2 at 4. The information sought is limited to information generated on the three devices. Respondent cites no authority requiring that the subpoena be further limited or defined.\n    <footnotemark>\n     2\n    </footnotemark>\n    Absent such authority, the court is not inclined to require a more detailed subpoena, especially considering that \"administrative investigatory subpoenas must by their very nature be broad.\"\n    <em>\n     United States v.

Instead, Respondent generally asserts that enforcement of the subpoenas would grant OIG access to her \"personal email, social media, location data, and internet search history,\" where personal, confidential communications are located. Respondent Reply at 4. These communications, Respondent argues, are of \"dubious relevance\" to the OIG's investigation into employee misconduct. Respondent Mot. at 6.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-25\">\n    Respondent's general assertion of irrelevance is insufficient to outweigh the OIG's assertion that it \"has reason to believe that [Respondent] has information relevant to the investigation, and has engaged in relevant communications using her BOP-issued devices.\" Thompson Decl. \u00b6 5. It is not \"obviously wrong\" that these relevant communications and information could be contained in Respondent's personal email, social media accounts, location data, or internet search history. Accordingly, the court finds that information contained on the BOP-owned devices-whether contained in personal accounts or elsewhere-is reasonably relevant to the OIG's investigation.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-26\">\n    <strong>\n     C. The Subpoenas Do Not Violate the Fourth Amendment\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-27\">\n    Respondent argues that enforcement of the OIG's subpoenas would violate her Fourth Amendment rights. Specifically, she argues that she has a reasonable expectation of privacy in \"her personal information stored on the devices and in the cloud,\" Respondent Mot. at 12, and that enforcement of the subpoenas would provide the OIG improper access to this information.

Specifically, the BOP Office of Information Technology's Samsung S7 policy handbook-which Respondent received along with her Samsung phone-states: \"[i]f personal information is stored on the device, it may be subject to search and production due to e-Discovery/litigation, FOIA requests, or an\n    <em>\n     administrative staff investigation\n    </em>\n    .\" ECF No. 5-2 (BOP Samsung Galaxy S7 Policy) at 42 (emphasis added). And when Respondent initially activated her BOP-issued Samsung phone, she was required to confirm her receipt and understanding that the Samsung phone is \"a Government furnished device and [that] all activities may be monitored.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 15; ECF No. 11-1 (Supplemental Declaration of Greg Thompson, \"Thompson Suppl.

This warning made clear that the \"information system\" included \"(1) this computer, (2) this computer network, (3) all computers connected to this network, and (4) all devices and storage media attached to this network or to a computer on this network.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    By the warning's express terms, all three BOP-owned devices-Samsung phone, Microsoft tablet, and Blackberry-are \"attached\" to the BOP network, and therefore are connected to the BOP information system and may be subject to search. Thompson Supp. Decl. \u00b6 4; Thompson Second Supp. Decl. \u00b6 6.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    Notwithstanding these warnings, Respondent maintains that she reasonably believed that the \"personal business [she] conducted while ... not connected to the BOP network would remain private.\" ECF No. 13-1 (Respondent Decl.) \u00b6 7. In her\n    declaration, she explains that both the Microsoft tablet and the Samsung phone enabled her to communicate and send documents outside of the BOP network. Once logged onto the Microsoft tablet, Respondent explains, she was able to either log in securely to the BOP network through a VPN connection via the \"Cisco\" application or she could conduct personal business on the tablet, unconnected to the BOP network.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 6-7. Respondent further explains that the Samsung phone has a \"Knox Workspace\" and a \"Personal Space\"-both of which require a different password.\n    <footnotemark>\n     3\n    </footnotemark>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 9-10.

Respondent maintains that it was her understanding that only those communications and documents transmitted while connected to the BOP network were monitored or subject to a search.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 7, 11. She believed that those communications and documents transmitted outside the network would remain private.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    However, as explained previously, BOP's policies make clear that all three BOP-owned devices are-in their entirety-a part of the \"information system\" because they are \"attached to [the BOP] network.\" Thompson Supp. Decl. \u00b6 4; Thompson Second Supp. Decl. \u00b6 6. While it is true that one can operate the devices without connecting to the BOP network, the devices themselves are attached to the network, and are therefore subject to monitoring, searching and seizure. Respondent was not informed otherwise.

Like the government employee in\n    <em>\n     Quon\n    </em>\n    , Respondent \"should have known that [her] actions were likely to come under legal scrutiny.\"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3641858,12454870\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/560/746/\">\n     560 U.S. at 762\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3641858,12454870\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/560/746/\">\n     130 S.Ct. 2619\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

Respondent's Privileged Communications with Counsel Must Be Protected\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    In a footnote, Respondent argues that because the BOP-issued Samsung phone \"contains privileged communications with counsel, any ruling in favor of the government should include the requirement that a taint team be assembled to ensure that [her] privilege is maintained.\" Reply at 4 n.3. Respondent does not provide any detail regarding the extent to which she used the BOP-owned devices to communicate with her attorneys. Nor does Respondent provide the court with a proposed order, describing the mechanisms the OIG should implement to ensure that Respondent's attorney-client privilege is maintained during its search of the electronic devices. Respondent also fails to cite any authority for her proposition that the court should require the assembling of a \"taint team\" prior to allowing the OIG to search the Samsung phone.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    Nonetheless, the court finds that, even in the context of enforceable administrative subpoenas, the subpoenaed party is entitled to the protection of her privileged communications with counsel.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     FTC v.
