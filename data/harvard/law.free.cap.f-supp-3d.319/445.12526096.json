Initially, as the government notes, \"the [d]efendant is not charged with making a false statement to [the] OFAC; rather, the [d]efendant is charged with conspiring with others to interfere with [the] OFAC's lawful functions of enforcement of laws and regulations prohibiting U.S. persons from doing business with SDGTs or blocked property without a license from [the] OFAC.\" Gov't's 4th Opp'n at 15. Further, as the Court previously noted, the making of false statements to the OFAC is but only one type of overt act that the defendant allegedly committed in furtherance of the conspiracy to defraud as charged in count one of the indictment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Indictment \u00b6\u00b6 25-41. And contrary to the defendant's proposition,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Def.'s 5th Reply at 2 (asserting that the other two categories of alleged overt acts do not apply to the charged conspiracy to defraud the United States because \"neither subsection ... mention[ ] [the] OFAC\" (emphasis removed) ), the language of count one of the Indictment does not limit any of the asserted overt acts to any one particular object of the conspiracy,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Indictment \u00b6\u00b6 26-41. Rather, the language clearly states that the defendant purportedly \"committed\" each of the asserted overt acts \"[i]n furtherance of [the charged] conspiracy.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25. Thus, the Court finds the defendant's argument that the charged conspiracy to defraud the United States is limited to the overt acts concerning his purportedly false statements made to the OFAC unconvincing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17(b) (charging the defendant with conspiracy \"to defraud the United States [g]overnment by interfering with and obstructing a lawful government function, that is,\n   <em>\n    the enforcement of laws and regulations prohibiting dealing with SDGTs or in blocked property without having first obtained the required licenses\n   </em>\n   \" (emphasis added), which logically would involve the alleged overt acts of conducting transactions with United States companies and corresponding with United States persons in furtherance of the charged conspiracy).\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   In any event, the Indictment does contain factual allegations that sufficiently apprise the defendant of the allegedly false statements made to the OFAC. For instance, count one specifically identifies three letters purportedly sent either by\n   the defendant or at the defendant's direction containing misrepresentations made to the OFAC,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 26-28, and count one further characterizes the defendant's purported misrepresentations,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27 (asserting that the defendant \"claimed that the [attached] report represented[ ] 'an unimpeded, objective view into [his] life and business,' when, in fact, [he] and others endeavored to conceal relevant facts and circumstances regarding his business dealings and the companies under his control from those preparing the report\"). Consequently, count one of the Indictment adequately puts the defendant on notice of the allegations regarding his purportedly false statements made to the OFAC that he must defend against. And inapposite to the defendant's contention,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Def.'s 5th to Dismiss at 7 (\"His submissions to [the] OFAC were many pages long, and each had multiple attachments. It is simply not sufficient for the government to identify [his] general summations of those attachments ... without providing factual allegations that actually explain to him what he is accused of concealing.\"), count one of the Indictment need not allege all false representations purportedly made to the OFAC for it to be sufficient,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Palfrey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3526725\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/499/34/#p45\">\n    499 F.Supp.2d at 45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[A]n indictment is not required to set forth all the evidence the [g]overnment plans to present.\"), particularly \"[b]ecause an indictment is a charging instrument rather than a discovery device,\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

However, the defendant's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Sensi\n   </em>\n   is misplaced for several reasons. First, as the government notes, the defendant has not cited, nor has the Court been able to locate, any authority where a court found that the rule of specialty limits the prosecution of an individual extradited to the facts set forth in the extradition request. In addition, although this Circuit's language in\n   <em>\n    Sensi\n   </em>\n   relied on by the defendant would appear to facially support his proposition that the prosecution must be based on the same facts, the Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Sensi\n   </em>\n   emphasized this requirement as part of its analysis of whether the rule of specialty was violated, given the explicit language of the treaty pursuant to which the defendant in\n   <em>\n    Sensi\n   </em>\n   was extradited.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10537848,3472437\" index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/879/888/\">\n    879 F.2d at 895\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that the treaty provided that \"[a] person extradited shall not be detained or proceeded against in the territory of the requesting Party [in the present case, the United States] for any offense other than\n   <em>\n    an extraditable offense established by the facts in respect of which his extradition has been granted\n   </em>\n   \");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10537848,3472437\" index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/879/888/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (\"The plain terms of ... the Extradition Treaty set out the two requirements that must be met for each count of the indictment.

Here, the Moroccan law incorporating the rule of specialty pursuant to which the defendant was extradited does not contain such language which limits the prosecution to the facts set forth in the request for extradition; rather, as acknowledged by\n   the defendant, it limits the prosecution of the extradited person to \"\n   <em>\n    the crime for which he was extradited\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s 7th Mot. to Dismiss at 9 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).

The defendant fails to cite any other legal authority supporting his position, and moreover, the defendant in\n    <em>\n     Santos\n    </em>\n    was charged pursuant to \u00a7 1956(a)(1),\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Santos\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3674087\" index=\"190\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/553/507/\">\n     553 U.S. at 509\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3674087\" index=\"191\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/553/507/\">\n     128 S.Ct. 2020\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , and not \u00a7 1956(a)(2). Additionally, as the government notes, \"courts have specifically approved money laundering charges coupled with underlying IEEPA counts.\" Gov't's 5th Opp'n at 13 (collecting cases).

In\n    <em>\n     Johnson\n    </em>\n    , the Supreme Court examined the Canadian extradition treaty to determine whether that defendant's extradition violated the rule of specialty,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3637513\" index=\"197\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/205/309/\">\n     205 U.S. at 316-20\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3637513\" index=\"198\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/205/309/\">\n     27 S.Ct. 539\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , and concluded that \"nothing in the treaty [ ] provide[d] [for] a person [to] be surrendered for one offense and then ... be punished for another,\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3637513\" index=\"199\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/205/309/\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3637513\" index=\"199\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/205/309/\">\n     at 321\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3637513\" index=\"200\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/205/309/\">\n     27 S.Ct. 539\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Thus, the Court focused on the crimes or charges being prosecuted, not the factual allegations set forth in the extradition request. Furthermore,\n    <em>\n     Casey\n    </em>\n    focused on the application of the doctrine of \"dual criminality,\" not the rule of specialty\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10519262,3810343\" index=\"201\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/980/1472/\">\n     980 F.2d at 1475\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . In any event, the Circuit in\n    <em>\n     Casey\n    </em>\n    reiterated the holding in\n    <em>\n     Johnson\n    </em>\n    that \"the principle of specialty ... [requires] a fugitive [to] only be prosecuted for the\n    <em>\n     crime\n    </em>\n    for which he was extradited.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10519262,3810343\" index=\"202\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/980/1472/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    at 1476 n.5 (emphasis added).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"18\">\n   <p id=\"p-116\">\n    The defendant also requests that the Court conduct an evidentiary hearing on his motion to dismiss pursuant to the rule of specialty.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Def.'s Request at 1. Specifically, the defendant states that \"it appears that a [Drug Enforcement Administration ('DEA') ] official met face-to-face with Moroccan officials to request [his] extradition. but the government has not mentioned the meeting, much less produced notes or memoranda reflecting what occurred,\" and therefore, \"the government [should] be [required] to produce a witness who can testify to precisely what role U.S. government officials played in requesting [his] extradition, and what the Moroccan government was told about [his] alleged connection with Hizballah and terrorism.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 2. Having concluded that denial of the defendant's motion to dismiss pursuant to the rule of specialty is warranted, the Court finds it unnecessary to hold an evidentiary hearing on that motion. And regarding the defendant's contention that a hearing is necessary given the government's purported omission of evidence concerning the purported face-to-face meeting between the Moroccan government and a DEA agent, the defendant does not proffer any argument or evidence regarding how that alleged omission would alter the Court's ruling on his motion to dismiss. In fact, contrary to the defendant's alleged assertion, the documentary evidence attached to his evidentiary request does not \"suggest that the DEA, in its meeting with Moroccan authorities, would have wrongly emphasized that [he] was wanted for terrorism and financing of terrorism.\" Def.'s Request Reply at 2 (asserting this position without any citation to any language in the attached document). Instead, that document only contains a recitation of the charges the defendant faces in this prosecution, as well as one comment allegedly made by the defendant \"that he was not involved with terrorists.\" Def.'s Request, Ex. 1 (DEA Report of Investigation (Mar. 28, 2017) (filed under seal) at DOJ_01299966. Accordingly, the Court must deny the defendant's request for an evidentiary hearing.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"19\">\n   <p id=\"p-117\">\n    The Court will contemporaneously issue an Order consistent with this Memorandum Opinion.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
