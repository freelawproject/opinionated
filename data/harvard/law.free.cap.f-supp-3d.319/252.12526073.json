In this suit for injunctive and declaratory relief, they allege that former head of the Environmental Protection Agency Scott Pruitt and the Agency itself have been intentionally flouting the Federal Records Act by failing both to create certain records and to maintain a proper records-management policy. They also allege that the National Archives and Record Administration (NARA) and its Archivist have been derelict in their duty to enforce the FRA against the Agency. Defendants - Pruitt, the EPA, NARA, and the Archivist - now move to dismiss all claims. Finding that all but one of Plaintiffs' counts can move forward, the Court will largely deny the Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

With those in mind, the Court must decide whether\n   <em>\n    Armstrong\n   </em>\n   's logic applies only to \u00a7 3106's provision governing\n   <em>\n    destruction\n   </em>\n   of records or whether, as the Government advocates, it reaches more broadly into records\n   <em>\n    creation\n   </em>\n   under \u00a7 3101 as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Defendants heavily rely on the FRA's comprehensive system of\n   <em>\n    administrative\n   </em>\n   enforcement, see MTD at 6-7, and the \"extensive administrative role\" for the Archivist.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reply at 4. In their view, this renders unnecessary any robust judicial review.

Yet this provision and the Archivist's other monitoring and oversight roles were also in force when\n   <em>\n    Armstrong\n   </em>\n   was decided. The D.C.

That is indeed true, but Plaintiffs persuasively distinguish \u00a7 3106 from their creation claim tethered to \u00a7 3101. Only in the former is there a clear enforcement provision - namely, recourse to the Attorney General. No other provision of the FRA requires the executive branch to commence action for a violation of the Act.

The Ellis Declaration includes the EPA's Records Management Policy, an FAQ from the Agency's intranet page with information about verbal communications, and a copy of a training slide regarding oral records.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ellis Decl., Exhs.

Plaintiffs' Complaint repeatedly mentions the EPA's recordkeeping policy,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Compl., \u00b6\u00b6 31-34, 63-66, and appears to concede that the Agency Records Management Policy attached as Exhibit A to the Declaration is the policy to which the Complaint refers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp. at 17. The Court therefore may consider that document. The other two documents are not incorporated by reference or relied upon by the Complaint. Plaintiffs allege that the EPA's\n   <em>\n    official\n   </em>\n   records-management program is inadequate by FRA guidelines.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl., \u00b6 65. The additional exhibits, which the Government refers to as \"guidance\" and \"training\" for employees,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   MTD at 9; Ellis Decl., \u00b6 7, are not part of the EPA's formal records policy instituted pursuant to the FRA and are therefore \"outside of the pleadings.\" The Court, accordingly, will not consider them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Even after reviewing the EPA Records Management Policy, Plaintiffs pass the pleading hurdle with little effort. That document does not mention any mandate to create records for \"substantive decisions and commitments reached orally\" as required by NARA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=36%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201222.22\">\n    36 C.F.R. \u00a7 1222.22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiffs' allegation that the program is insufficient under the FRA, therefore, is a plausible claim upon which this Court can grant relief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl., \u00b6 64 (alleging that EPA's inadequate records-management program \"depriv[es] plaintiff[s] of present and future access to important agency documents that would shed light on the conduct of EPA officials and the bases for their actions and decisions\").

Under \u00a7 2115 of the Act, \"[w]hen the Archivist finds that a provision of [the FRA] has been or is being violated, the Archivist shall (1) inform in writing the head of the agency concerned of the violation and make recommendations for its correction; and (2) unless satisfactory corrective measures are demonstrably commenced within a reasonable time, submit a written report of the matter to the President and the Congress.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=44%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202115\">\n    44 U.S.C. \u00a7 2115\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). The finding of a violation is thus a condition precedent to the Archivist's statutory obligation to act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sierra Club v. Jackson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4107272\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/724/33/#p41\">\n    724 F.Supp.2d 33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 41 (D.D.C. 2010) (\"Statutory grants of enforcement authority commonly condition enforcement on a prior finding,\n   and courts recognize those conditions precedent as a prerequisite to an agency's exercise of its authority.\");\n   <em>\n    Judicial Watch, Inc. v.

The Government argues that the statute's obligations are not triggered until \"the Archivist concludes that an agency has violated or is violating the FRA.\" MTD at 12. Plaintiffs retort that such an argument attempts to \"impose on the Archivist an obligation to make a formal finding,\" which the statute does not require.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp. at 3. In their view, after CREW sent a letter to the Archivist \"laying out the multiple ways in which Administrator Pruitt and the EPA have acted in apparent violation of the FRA,\" Plaintiffs believe that \"NARA made initial 'investigative findings' \" and \"took initial steps toward satisfying the notification requirement.\" Opp. at 20-21. This, they claim, is enough to trigger the mandatory enforcement provisions of \u00a7 2115 or, at the very least, constitutes a failure to act, entitling them to relief under the APA.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The Court need not amble down the path of statutory interpretation because the Complaint fails on a more fundamental level: it never alleges that the Archivist made a finding (formal or otherwise) of a\n   <em>\n    violation\n   </em>\n   . True, CREW sent a letter notifying him of what\n   <em>\n    it thought\n   </em>\n   were FRA-compliance issues.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl., \u00b6\u00b6 49-52. The Complaint, however, never states that the Archivist replied or indicated in any way that a violation had occurred. In response to CREW's letter, the Archivist \"informed CREW that he had sent a letter to ... EPA's Acting Assistant Administrator ... requesting a meeting within 30 days.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 50. A month and a half later, CREW again contacted NARA to find out \"whether a meeting had in fact taken place and whether [the Agency] could share any information regarding the issues CREW had raised.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 51. NARA replied only that it had \"been in communication with the Senior Agency Official for [records management] at EPA and underst[oo]d that senior management at EPA are finalizing proposed actions to communicate back to [it].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   When pressed the following month for an update, NARA indicated that \"the matter was discussed with the EPA Chief of Staff\" and it was expecting \"formal correspondence next month responding to the issue.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 52. Plaintiffs' failure to allege that the Archivist made any actual finding of a violation - the condition precedent for \u00a7 2115's obligations - is fatal to Count III. The Court will accordingly dismiss it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   For the above reasons, the Court will deny Defendants' Motion as to Counts I and II and grant it as to Count III. A separate Order consistent with this Opinion will be issued this day.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
