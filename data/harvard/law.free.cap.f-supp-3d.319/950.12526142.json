R. 185, Second Am. Compl. FCA (or Fiat Chrysler Automobiles US LLC) advertises, markets, and distributes automobiles under the Chrysler, Ram, Dodge, Jeep, and Fiat brands.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 195, Ans. to Second Am. Compl., \u00b6 4. Velocity's patent uses a processor subsystem and a series of \"notification circuits\" to notify car drivers of certain driving conditions. Velocity alleges FCA has infringed Claims 1, 17, 18, 19, 28, 33, 34, 42, 59, 60, 64, 69, and 76-79 of the patent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Judge Darrah, the previous judge on this case, issued a claims construction order on September 21, 2016.

First, it argues that certain features in its vehicles-which provide notifications to drivers of certain driving conditions-do not infringe on Velocity's patent. R. 342. Second, FCA argues that several of Velocity's claims (Claims 69, 76-79)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   are invalid as improperly broadened claims. R. 349. Third, FCA argues that Claim 28 should be construed as a means-plus-function claim.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=13%20Cow.%208419\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Finally, FCA argues Velocity cannot show that FCA willfully infringed Velocity's patent. R. 342. Velocity brings a summary judgment motion as to an element of damages, arguing that a non-infringing alternative identified by FCA is not an acceptable non-infringing alternative as a matter of law. R. 338. For the following reasons, FCA's motion for summary judgment is granted in part and denied in part. The Court reserves ruling on Velocity's motion until after Daubert motions are decided.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Summary judgment must be granted \"if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.

The patent is entitled \"METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR OPTIMIZING VEHICLE OPERATION\" and describes a system that \"notifies the driver of recommended corrections in vehicle operation and, under certain conditions, automatically initiates selected corrective action.\" R. 344-1, '781 Pat. at 1:7-10. The patent generally claims several sensors, a memory subsystem, a processor subsystem, and notification circuits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   As shown in the image below, the '781 patent describes a processor subsystem that receives data from sensors and activates various circuits to notify the driver of certain conditions affecting the car. Those circuits include a fuel overinjection notification circuit, an upshift notification circuit, a downshift notification circuit, and a vehicle proximity alarm circuit. Relevant to this opinion, the sensors monitor road speed, engine speed (in rotations per minute or \"RPM\"), manifold pressure, and throttle position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The notification circuits provide warnings to the driver that certain conditions are present. At issue in most of this opinion is the fuel overinjection notification circuit, represented in box 38 of the above diagram.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   As the '781 patent explains, the fuel overinjection notification circuit \"notif[ies] the driver that, in order to optimize vehicle operation, the amount of fuel being supplied to the engine should be reduced.\" R. 344-1, '781 Pat. at 12:13-15. This notification essentially tells the driver when the vehicle is and is not being operated in a fuel-efficient manner.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13:41-45. The term \"overinjection notification circuit\" was construed as: \"A circuit that notifies a driver that more fuel is being supplied to the engine than is necessary.\" R. 114. at 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In its claims construction order, the Court determined that the term \"processor subsystem\"-used in the patent for describing the various notification circuits-was construed with a \"means-plus-function\" limitation governed by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20112\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f). That statute states that \"an element in a claim for a combination may be expressed as a means or step for performing a specified function without the recital of structure, material, or acts in support thereof, and such claim shall be construed to cover the corresponding structure, material, or acts described in the specification and equivalents thereof.\" The Court held that the claim language states that the processor subsystem \"determines\" whether to activate a notification circuit. R. 114 at 13. But because the claim does not provide sufficient structure for performing the functions recited in the claims,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , determining whether to activate the notification circuit, \u00a7 112(f) applied and the claim required an algorithm.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20112\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Court then adopted the following algorithm that describes when to activate the fuel overinjection notification circuit:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   Activating the Fuel Overinjection Notification Circuit When:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   1.

The Court will refer to each scenario (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , \"road speed is increasing, throttle position is increasing, and manifold pressure is above a manifold pressuring setpoint\") as a \"condition.\" Velocity's expert, Christopher Wilson, calls the two conditions the \"acceleration\" scenario and the \"lugging\" scenario, respectively. R. 348-1, Expert Report of Christopher Wilson, \u00b6 307.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court adopts those references here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The algorithm describes the \"process subsystem\" for the various circuits of the patent.

The first, the Fuel Saver Indicator (\"FSI\") is an indicator intended to inform the driver when he is operating the vehicle in a fuel-efficient manner through an \"eco\" or a \"fuel saver\" notification.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22. When the fuel saver indicator is off (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the word \"eco\" is not displayed), it serves as a notification that more fuel than necessary is being supplied to the engine.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   For the second infringing feature, Velocity alleges FCA's miles per gallon (\"MPG\") display infringes the fuel overinjection notification circuit because the driver is notified when more fuel than is necessary is being supplied to the engine by monitoring the instantaneous MPG and noting when it is below the average (or default) MPG, either through the use of changing colors or a MPG number.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23. Finally, the third infringing feature is the Fiat ECO Index display.

(emphasis added). The system is binary-only if a required condition is true does the system move to the next condition.

But those four conditions are not the conditions in the patent's algorithm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   At best, Velocity can point to portions of the FSI algorithm as representing analogues of each parameter of the claimed algorithm to argue the two structures are insubstantially different.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 383, Resp. to FCA SMF as to Infringement, \u00b6 33 (explaining how different features and code of the FSI algorithm represent the required parameters in the claimed algorithm). But because the patent's algorithm requires the parameters to be met\n   <em>\n    together\n   </em>\n   to activate the fuel overinjection notification circuit, pointing to analogues of each parameter is not enough. Instead, to defeat summary judgment, Velocity needs to show that the parameter's equivalents in FSI's algorithm work\n   <em>\n    together\n   </em>\n   to represent an equivalent structure as in the patent.

First, Velocity attributes Wilson's testimony cited above to the debounce timer. That timer prevents the FSI notification light from flickering with changing conditions and annoying the driver. The debouncing timer runs for a certain number of seconds once it is turned on, regardless if the conditions change. R. 379 at 15. But Velocity fails to cite to any facts that indicate the debouncing timer is the reason for the distinction between the two algorithms, or the reason for its expert's testimony that the FSI notification does not activate when the '781 patent algorithm conditions are true. Instead, it cites to two statements of fact that describe the debounce timer generally, and a statement pointing to the testimony of FCA's invalidity expert, a statement that does not relate to its citation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 379 at 15 (citing R. 382, Velocity statement of additional facts in support of its opposition (\"SOAF\"), \u00b6\u00b6 73-74, 94). Velocity also attempts to explain its expert's testimony by claiming that the differences between the results amount to abnormal circumstances, and that a reasonable jury would find that in normal operation, the FSI light operates in the exact same way as the '781 patent. R. 379 at 16. But again, Velocity's cited facts do not support that assertion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   (citing R. 382, Velocity SOAF, \u00b6\u00b6 72-75) (discussing the debounce timer and describing the four conditions that comprise the FSI algorithm, none of which match the claimed algorithm). And, in response to one of FCA's statements of facts, Velocity explains that a potential reason for the discrepancies in activation may be based on the disabling conditions used in FSI's algorithm. R. 383, Resp. to FCA SMF as to Infringement, \u00b6 49. But the disabling conditions are further indication that the FSI algorithm does not rely on the same algorithm as in the patent, and instead activates based on a separate set of parameters and conditions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Second, Velocity argues that even the patent's preferred embodiment would not always activate the notification when all the conditions were met. R. 379 at 20-21. But Velocity provides no support that this failure to activate in certain scenarios is the reason for the difference in results between the claimed algorithm and the FSI features. Further, there is no indication that the FSI algorithm contains the same parameters as the claimed algorithm (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   not activating below 20mph or above 50mph). Velocity's attempt to explain away its expert's testimony merely introduces additional differences between the two algorithms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Finally, Velocity argues that FCA has conceded that the FSI light will turn off at\n   least some of the time when the acceleration and lugging tests are met, meaning that the product infringes at least some of the time. R. 379 at 20. Velocity cites to\n   <em>\n    Broadcom Corp. v. Emulex Corp.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3710401\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/732/1325/#p1333\">\n    732 F.3d 1325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1333 (Fed.

Utah 1997) in support of its argument that products that infringe some of the time are sufficient for a finding of infringement. But Velocity gets ahead of itself. To show infringement some of the time, Velocity first must show infringement at any time, which it has not done. As explained above, Velocity cannot point to any set of facts to support infringement, unlike the plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    Broadcom\n   </em>\n   , who had pointed to sufficient evidence that the accused device met all other claim limitations,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3710401\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/732/1325/#p1333\">\n    732 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1331 ; or in\n   <em>\n    Sanders Brine\n   </em>\n   , where the court found that simply because the accused product occasionally failed by getting \"stuck,\" did not transform it from an infringing device to a non-infringing one,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"238825\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/970/892/#p904\">\n    970 F.Supp. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   907 n.26. Here, Velocity does not point to evidence that supports infringement at any time, because it fails to show that the accused algorithm relies on the same or equivalent parameters in the same way as the claimed algorithm defined by the Court's claim construction order. Simply because the two algorithms sometimes reach consistent results does not mean the FSI product infringes on the patent without evidence that the same or an equivalent structure is in fact used.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   FCA has met its burden to show that no reasonable trier of fact could find that FCA's FSI feature infringes on Velocity's patent because it does not use the same or an equivalent algorithm as required by the means-plus-function test. Specifically, FCA has produced uncontested evidence that indicates the FSI algorithm does not use the same parameters in the same way as used by the claimed algorithm. FCA has also shown that the FSI algorithm activates when the claimed conditions are not met and fails to activate when the conditions are met. As a result, they cannot be equivalent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Odetics\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11587475\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/185/1259/#p1267\">\n    185 F.3d at 1267\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (an equivalent must perform the claimed function in substantially the same way to achieve substantially the same result as the corresponding structure described in the specification). No reasonable jury could find that the FSI algorithm contains the same or an equivalent structure as the patent's algorithm.

Whether the MPG feature performs the identical function using an identical or equivalent structure as described in the patent.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   FCA makes similar arguments regarding the MPG feature. R. 343 at 12-23. However, FCA has failed to meet its burden in presenting sufficient uncontested facts to show there is no genuine dispute of fact as to whether the MPG algorithm is the same or an equivalent algorithm as in the patent. For example, unlike the FSI algorithm, where FCA pointed to the FSI algorithm itself, FCA fails to point to an algorithm for the MPG feature that shows that it does not track the patented algorithm. The Court acknowledges that FCA pointed to evidence indicating the MPG feature in FCA's products produces different results than the patented algorithm, but without evidence as to the algorithm itself, the Court cannot decide that the MPG feature does not infringe. Accordingly, FCA's motion on this basis is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Whether the MPG feature meets the claimed fuel overinjection notification circuit.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   FCA also argues that there is no genuine dispute of material fact that the MPG\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   feature does not infringe the fuel overinjection notification circuit. The Court previously denied summary judgment on this issue, holding that whether the MPG display issues notifications that inform the driver that more fuel is being provided to the engine than necessary is a contested question of material fact. R. 116 at 8-9. FCA claims that all contested issues of material fact existing at the time of that opinion have since been resolved. R. 343 at 25. Here, as in the previous motion, FCA argues that the MPG display merely provides information as to the instantaneous miles per gallon rate and does not notify the driver that more fuel than necessary is being supplied to the engine.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 116 at 8; R. 343 at 26-27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The Court construed the fuel overinjection notification circuit as \"a circuit that notifies a driver that more fuel is being supplied to the engine than is necessary.\" R. 114 at 9.

FCA also cites to Velocity's expert that the display provides a notification that \"something has changed\" and that the fuel consumption was more or less efficient than it was recently:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   And if you see deviations above or below that average fuel economy, then in my mind that is certainly a notification that something has changed and your driving is less efficient or more efficient than it was recently.

Efficiency is based on how much of something is necessary to complete a particular task (R. 114 at 9), and Wilson explains that is what the MPG display shows, by showing a difference between the instantaneous fuel efficiency and the average fuel efficiency.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 348-1, Wilson Report, at \u00b6\u00b6 284-289. Whether the MPG display issues notifications that inform the driver that more fuel is being provided to the engine than necessary is thus a contested question of fact.

FCA argues the claimed algorithm is infringed only if the infringing algorithm contains\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   the acceleration and the lugging conditions in its code. R. 343 at 23-25. Because Velocity does not assert that the MPG and ECO Index algorithms include both, FCA contends Velocity cannot show infringement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Velocity, on the other hand, argues that the two sets of conditions are two disjunctive algorithms, and meeting one is sufficient to infringe. R. 379 at 21-24. The Court agrees with Velocity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   While the claims construction order states that the \"algorithm includes\" the two sets of conditions, it is clear from the patent that the two conditions are different aspects of the patent, either of which may\n   be infringed. The Summary of the Invention lists the acceleration test as \"one aspect,\" and the lugging test, as a \"further aspect,\" which the processor subsystem \"may\" perform. R. 344-1, '781 Pat. at 2:9-36. Other \"aspects\" of the patent include various notification circuit algorithms.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3. The Court cannot read \"further aspect\" as it relates to the lugging scenario differently than it can read \"further aspect\" as to the remaining circuits. To do so (adopting FCA's approach) would require a product to meet all the aspects of the patent to infringe. Further, the written description of the patent discloses the acceleration and lugging tests as two separate claims, each reciting a separate invention.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14:13-47;\n   <em>\n    Jones v.

In its claims construction order, the Court found that the claim language that the processor subsystem \"determines\" whether to activate a notification circuit implies that the processor subsystem must compare data to determine whether to activate a notification circuit, which requires additional programming of the processor. R. 114 at 13. As a result, the Court held because the patent calls for a processor to perform more than a general function, and the claims do not provide sufficient structure for performing those functions, an algorithm is required.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4275499\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/792/1339/#p1348\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Those same reasons apply to Claim 28. Like the other claims, Claim 28 recites a \"processor subsystem determining whether to activate [a] fuel overinjection notification [circuit].\" As with the other claims, Claim 28 recites that the determination by the processor subsystem is \"based upon date received from\" a number of claimed sensors. In Claim 28, the applicable sensors are the road speed sensor, the throttle position sensor, and the manifold pressure sensor. Although the claim explains which sensors to draw data from, it does\n   not provide a structure of how to determine that data so that a processor may perform general functions such as processing, receiving, or storing. As a result, an algorithm is required as in Claims 1, 17, and 60. Accordingly, the Court adopts the following construction for Claim 28:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-94\"><strong>\"Processor\" Subsystem</strong> <strong>Claims</strong> <strong>Construction</strong> 28 <strong>Function:</strong> determines whether to activate \"a processor subsystem .. said fuel overinjection notification circuit . said processor subsystem based upon the data received from said determining whether to road speed sensor, said throttle position activate said fuel sensor, and said manifold pressure sensor overinjection notification sensor based upon data <strong>Corresponding Structure:</strong> a received from said road microprocessor programmed to perform speed sensor, said throttle the algorithm described at 11:13-13:7 and position sensor and said Figs. 2A-2B. Specifically, the algorithm manifold pressure includes: sensor.\" Activating the Fuel Overinjection Notification Circuit When: 1. Road speed is increasing; and 2. Throttle position is increasing; and 3. Manifold pressure is above a manifold pressure set point; <strong><em>Or</em></strong> 1. Road speed is decreasing; and 2. Throttle position is increasing; and 3. Manifold pressure is increasing; and 4. Engine speed is decreasing.</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Velocity opposes construing Claim 28 in this way, arguing Claim 28 is not properly construed as a means-plus-function claim and that it would be prejudiced by the change.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   First, Velocity argues Claim 28 is unique because it recites specific data that must be used to determine whether to activate the notification circuit, while the remaining claims provide for different combinations of different data. R. 370 at 15. Specifically, it argues Claims 1, 17, and 60 leave open the possibility that the processor's determinations may be based on more than one of the recited sensors. In contrast, Velocity argues, Claim 28 specifies that the determination is based on the three recited sensors. Velocity points to no evidence or case law to support its position that this distinction warrants a different construction. Further, Claim 28 does not specify how to interpret that data, regardless of whether it is based on three specific sensors or some combination of three sensors. At bottom, the processor subsystem must still compare data, but the claim does not describe how to compare that data. Accordingly, the processor subsystem cannot perform general functions, requires additional programming to process the data, and as a result, requires a construction based on an algorithm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Second, the Court is not convinced that Velocity is prejudiced by the construction of Claim 28 with a means-plus-function limitation. Velocity was aware of FCA's position since at least December 4, 2017 and took discovery on both structures. R. 394, Resp. to Velocity SOAF, \u00b6 51 (admitted); R. 375, Velocity Resp. to FCA SMF as to Invalidity, \u00b6 26 (admitted in relevant part). The cases on which it relies to argue\n   the Court should decline FCA's proposed construction are not analogous. For example, in\n   <em>\n    Bettcher Indus. v.

Rather, it simply adds Claim 28 to the other claims already construed as means-plus-function claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   For this reason, the Court is not persuaded by Velocity's conclusory arguments that it would have \"selected different claims,\" approached claims construction differently, asked for reconsideration of the claims construction order, or made different strategic decisions. R. 370 at 13-15. Claim 28 is just one of many means-plus-function claims which incorporate similar \"processor subsystem ... said processor subsystem determining\" language. Velocity chose not to proceed as it suggests on any of the remaining claims incorporating that language.

R. 379 at 30-31. Specifically, Velocity argues (1) FCA failed to start collecting source code until February of 2017, did not timely investigate if relevant source code was in its possession, and made no effort to determine if the accused features infringed on the patent; (2) FCA does not have a formal process for assessing infringement; and (3) FCA's defenses are not based on good faith assessments of the case. Velocity also argues that FCA expanded its infringing activities without performing a good faith investigation of the merits at \"the time of the challenged conduct\" and failed to implement the allegedly non-infringing alternatives FCA\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   claims were available and easy to implement.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597516\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1923/#p1932\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   FCA disputes many of the statements of fact on which Velocity relies in support of its arguments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 394, Resp. to Velocity SOAF, \u00b6\u00b6 9-17, 19, 21, 22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Based on the record, the Court concludes that contested issues of material fact exist which preclude summary judgment. A reasonable jury could find that FCA's subjective intent was to infringe the patent in bad faith. The existence of disputed evidence that FCA continued to infringe after being sued and made no effort to ensure it was not infringing could support a finding of willfulness. Accordingly, summary judgment is denied as to willfulness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Whether FCA had non-infringing alternatives available.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Finally, Velocity's summary judgment motion discusses non-infringing alternatives related to a different notification circuit-the \"proximity alarm circuit.\" The proximity alarm circuit issues alarms if the vehicle is too close to another object. That circuit requires the vehicle brake to be off (the driver is not pressing the brake pedal) to activate (the \"brake activation check\"). R. 114 at 15 (describing the means-plus-function algorithm). Non-infringing alternatives are part of a reasonable royalty analysis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Grain Processing Corp. v. Am. Maize-Prod. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11587756\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/185/1341/#p1352\">\n    185 F.3d 1341\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1352 (Fed. Cir. 1999). The Federal Circuit has implicitly recognized that the absence of existing non-infringing alternatives does not preclude a reduction in the reasonable royalty awarded to patentees. While \"[t]here was...no available and acceptable non-infringing alternative to which [the defendant] could have switched at the time of the hypothetical negotiation,\" the fact that there was a possibility that the defendant \"could have come up with one\" was sufficient to justify the district court's reduction of a blended royalty rate.\n   <em>\n    Mars, Inc. v.

When an alleged alternative is not on the market during the accounting period,\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   the burden shifts to the alleged infringer to show that the substitute was \"available\" based on alternative actions the alleged infringer reasonably could have taken.\n   <em>\n    DePuy Spine, Inc. v.

Cir. 2009). Accordingly, FCA has the burden to show that its non-infringing alternatives were available and acceptable.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Velocity argues that FCA's use of two features, (1) Adaptive Cruise Control (\"ACC\") and (2) Forward Collision Warning (\"FCW\"), infringe on the proximity alarm notification circuit. R. 356 at 4.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   ACC is like traditional cruise control (where the vehicle maintains a set speed) but also modulates the vehicle's speed based on the speed of a vehicle in front of it (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , it will slow down if the vehicle ahead is traveling at a slower speed and gets too close). R. 401, Reply to FCA's\n   Counter-Statement of Facts, \u00b6\u00b6 44-45. When the ACC system determines that it cannot decrease the vehicle speed quickly enough in relation to a slower moving vehicle in front of it, the system will issue a notification to the driver in the form of a \"takeover request,\" for the driver to take control of the vehicle.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 47. FCW also issues notifications to the driver.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 49. FCW detects objects ahead of the vehicle and, when the system determines that the object causes risk of a front-end collision, it issues a notification to warn the driver of that possible collision.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Both features are deactivated when the driver depresses the brake pedal.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 46, 50.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   During expert discovery, FCA's expert witness, Dr. John Martens, opined that a non-infringing alternative could be available for the ACC and FCW systems. Specifically, the alternative would remove the \"brake activation check\" required by the algorithm by removing cancellation of the \"takeover\" request in the ACC feature or the collision notifications in the FCW feature when the brake pedal was depressed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 55. FCA asserts that the allegedly infringing features themselves (such as cruise control) would still be deactivated, but the notifications alerting the driver would not turn off until the vehicle reached a distance that did not trigger the proximity alarm circuit. R. 367 at 5-6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Velocity first argues that the proposed non-infringing alternative is not acceptable because the alternative would change the characteristics of the features by annoying the driver and creating safety concerns. But Velocity does not point to any undisputed facts that indicate the non-infringing alternative would not be commercially acceptable. Indeed, FCA disputed most of Velocity's statements of facts and presented evidence that removing the \"brake activation check\" would be commercially acceptable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 368, Resp. to Velocity SMF, \u00b6\u00b6 26-30. Specifically, Dr. Martens opined that doing so would mean the algorithm would no longer meet the \"vehicle brake is off\" limitation which was allegedly causing the infringement. R. 358-1, Martens Report, at 71. FCA also presented evidence that removing the brake activation check is not an important characteristic of its features. R. 368, Resp. to Velocity SMF, \u00b6\u00b6 32-34, 37-38. Further, alternatives need not be \"effectively identical\" in performance to be acceptable.\n   <em>\n    Carnegie Mellon Univ. v. Marvell Tech. Grp., Ltd.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%203686736\">\n    2012 WL 3686736\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (W.D. Pa. Aug. 24, 2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Second, Velocity argues FCA has not presented any evidence that the cost of the alternative is acceptable. R. 356 at 11. FCA's expert Dr. Martens explained that the non-infringing alternative would involve a simple software change by removing the brake activation check. R. 358-1, Martens Report, at 71. Velocity criticizes the expert's report as conclusory and argues that he failed to provide an exact number for the cost of the alternative. But Velocity fails to provide any support as to why an exact number is required to determine how costly a non-infringing alternative would be. The Federal Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Mars\n   </em>\n   reduced the reasonable royalty rate based only on the fact that there was a possibility that the defendant \"could have come up with\" a non-infringing alternative.\n   <em>\n    Mars\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3566504,3567119\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/527/1359/\">\n    527 F.3d at 1373\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   The Court is inclined to deny Velocity's motion on this basis. However, Velocity has moved to exclude Dr. Martens' testimony about whether the non-infringing alternative would be commercially acceptable, R. 418 at 32, which represents some of FCA's evidence responding to Velocity's summary judgment motion. As a result, the Court reserves ruling on this issue until the parties' Daubert motions are resolved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court grants in part and denies in part FCA's request for summary judgment, R. 342 and R. 349, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-116\">\n   1) FCA's motion is granted as to infringement of the Fuel Saver Indicator feature but denied as to infringement of the MPG display and the Fiat ECO Index display;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-117\">\n   2) FCA's motion as to invalidity of Claims 69 and 76-79 is granted;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-118\">\n   3) FCA's motion requesting Claim 28 be construed as a means-plus-function claim is granted;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-119\">\n   4) FCA's motion regarding willfulness is denied.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   The Court reserves ruling on Velocity's summary judgment motion, R. 338, until after it hears expert testimony under Daubert.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-123\">\n    Velocity initially alleged infringement of Claims 1, 7, 13, 17-20, 28, 33-34, 40-42, 46, 53, 56, 58, 60, 64, 66, 69, 75-79, and 88.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    R. 114 at 3.
