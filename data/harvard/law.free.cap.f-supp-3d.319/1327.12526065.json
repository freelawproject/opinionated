The Defendant goes on to assert, without any record analysis to support it, that nothing in the record supports a finding that the prices, costs, or expenses are aberrational compared to other U.S. sales.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   A sale is aberrational when it deviates from the usual or normal way or may be regarded as atypical.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Webster's Third New Int'l Dictionary of the English Language Unabridged (2002) at 3 (defining \"aberration\" as an \"act of wandering away or going astray: deviation from ... a normal type.\") Defendant acknowledges that the sale in question was invoiced differently because of the nature of the product, recognizing that it was atypical of Hyundai Steel's U.S. sales. As such, the sale was aberrational and an inappropriate basis for the selection of an AFA margin.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   The agency has broad discretion to select a margin to use as adverse facts available, particularly following the amendments to 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677e pursuant to the TPEA and when using primary information as AFA; however, that discretion is not unbounded. While the margin need not reflect any alleged \"commercial reality\" or otherwise seek to estimate what the margin might otherwise have been,\n   19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677e(d)(3), an AFA margin is unsupported by substantial evidence when it is based on an aberrational transaction.

Commerce's Denial of a CEP Offset\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Plaintiff's final challenge to the\n   <em>\n    Final Determination\n   </em>\n   is to Commerce's decision to deny Hyundai Steel a CEP offset. Pl.'s Br. at 40-45. Plaintiff asserts that Commerce's denial of a CEP offset was unsupported by substantial evidence because Plaintiff's home market level of trade is more advanced than its U.S. level of trade. Pl.'s Br. at 40. According to Plaintiff, the record established that Hyundai Steel performed significantly greater selling activities in selling to its unaffiliated home market customers than to its U.S. affiliates in all four categories of activities that Commerce examines: (1) sales and marketing; (2) freight and delivery; (3) inventory maintenance and warehousing; and (4) warranty and technical support. Pl.'s Br. at 41-43; Pl.'s Reply at 21. Plaintiff further argues that Commerce unjustifiably denied Plaintiff a CEP offset, when it previously had granted a CEP offset in other cases with similar facts. Pl.'s Br. at 44-45.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Commerce's determination is unsupported by substantial evidence. Here, Commerce examined the four selling function categories it typically considers for a CEP offset analysis: (1) sales and marketing; (2) freight and delivery services; (3) inventory maintenance and warehousing; and (4) warranty and technical support.
