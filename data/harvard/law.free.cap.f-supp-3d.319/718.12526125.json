After the parties entered into a Settlement Agreement, the Court dismissed the case, retaining jurisdiction to enforce the Settlement Agreement. The parties have now each moved to enforce the Settlement Agreement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Panchenkova also moves to seal portions of the moving papers and the Settlement Agreement submitted in conjunction with her motion to enforce.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The parties have also sought their fees and costs for filing this motion. For the reasons set forth below, Panchenkova's motion to enforce the Settlement Agreement is granted, Chigirinskiy's cross-motion is\n   granted in part and denied in part, and Panchenkova's motion to seal is denied except as specified below. Both parties' requests for costs and fees are denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Pre-Settlement Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The dispute about the Settlement Agreement arises from a series of legal actions between Panchenkova and Chigirinskiy in Russia and the United States relating to their marriage, family, and assets. On April 14, 2009, Chigirinskiy and Panchenkova \"were divorced by a Divorce Decree of the Presnenskiy District Court of Moscow, Russia\" (hereinafter the \"Divorce Decree\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Settlement Agreement, dated Jan. 18, 2018 (annexed as Ex. 2 to Eilender Decl.), at 1. On July 3, 2009, the Simonovsky District Court of Moscow, Russia, issued a judgment dividing the parties' marital property between them.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. The judgment included a ruling that certain items were gifts from Chigirinskiy to Panchenkova and thus were solely owned by Panchenkova.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   It also ordered Chigirinskiy to pay Panchenkova \"an equalization payment.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Litigation between Chigirinskiy and Panchenkova followed in both the United States and Russia. The Settlement Agreement reflects that the parties are still opposing each other in a case in Connecticut State Court regarding certain personal matters which, as explained in section IV below, we have ordered sealed (hereinafter the \"Connecticut Case\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 3. In 2012, Panchenkova also initiated an action against Chigirinskiy in Connecticut State Court to enforce the judgment entered by the Simonovsky District Court (hereinafter the \"Connecticut Enforcement Action\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. Lastly, Panchenkova initiated several proceedings in Russia to enforce the judgment that was entered in Russia against Chigirinskiy, which are now pending with the Moscow Inter-District Bailiff Service (the \"Russian Enforcement Proceeding\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3. As a result of Russian legal proceedings, Chigirinskiy and Panchenkova each own one-half interests in three apartments in St. Petersburg, Russia.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In conjunction with the Russian Enforcement Proceeding, Chigirinskiy was assessed a fee by the Moscow Inter-District Bailiff Service of \"over 52 million Russian Roubles,\" or approximately $900,000 (hereinafter the \"Bailiff's Fee\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   Pl. Mem. at 6; Eilender Decl. \u00b6 8. The parties have submitted declarations from experts on Russian law describing the nature of this Fee.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   These experts agree that the Bailiff's Fee is a \"penalty\" or \"sanction\" imposed on the debtor in an enforcement proceeding that, once paid, is credited directly to the Russian federal government.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rachkov Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 20-21 (describing the Bailiff's Fee as \"a monetary penalty imposed on the debtor in case of non-execution of an execution document within the period established for a voluntary execution of the executive document,\" and that this fee, once paid, is \"credited to the [Russian] federal budget\"); Ryabchenko Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 5, 8 (describing the Bailiff's Fee as \"a sanction imposed by the court bailiff, without a court ruling, by his own determination, upon the debtor who fails to comply, within the time period set by\n   the court enforcement bailiff, with lawful demands of the court enforcement bailiff directed at execution of an enforcement document,\" and further noting that this fee represents \"7% of every amount presented to the debtor by the bailiff with an instruction to pay the debt voluntarily within 5 days, and charged once the debtor has failed in that duty in the time period set by the law without good cause.\") (emphasis omitted).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On June 5, 2014, Chigirinskiy initiated the instant action seeking, among other things, to recover from Panchenkova \"tens of millions of dollars of property that belongs to him,\" including \"fine art, religious icons, antiques, unique and valuable decorative objects, jewelry and valuable antiques, and an historic library of Russian literature.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint, dated June 5, 2014 (annexed as Docket # 4-1 to Defendant's Amended Notice of Removal, filed June 25, 2014 (Docket # 4) (\"Am.

Panchenkova thereafter asserted counterclaims against Chigirinskiy arising from, among other things, his purported failure to pay her as required by prior court orders, including pursuant to the Divorce Decree.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Amended Answer to the Second Amended Complaint and Counterclaims of Tatiana Romanovna Panchenkova, filed May 9, 2017 (Docket # 199) (\"Am.

Eilender, filed Nov. 15, 2017 (Docket # 276). On December 13, 2017, however, Panchenkova's counsel filed another letter stating that the parties had come to an impasse with respect to one issue, and warned that \"the Court's involvement may ultimately be needed to ascertain [the settlement's] specific terms with respect to the one issue that remains unresolved.\" Letter from Vitali S. Rosenfeld, filed Dec. 13, 2017 (Docket # 279), at *1.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Court held a conference on January 12, 2018.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Memorandum Endorsement of Letter from George Benaur, dated Dec. 20, 2017 (Docket # 284); Minute Entry for Pretrial Conference, dated Jan. 12, 2018. Following the conference, the parties reached a final Settlement Agreement, which was executed by Chigirinskiy on January 18, 2018, and by Panchenkova on January 19, 2018.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Settlement Agreement at 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Agreement provides that each party releases all claims that they \"ever had, now have, or hereafter can, shall or may have, for, upon, or by reason of any matter, cause or thing whatsoever from the beginning of the world to the day of execution of this Settlement Agreement\" against the other party, and that each party covenants not to sue or maintain other legal actions against the opposing party, except for \"claim[s] for breach[es] of this Settlement Agreement\" and \"claims or obligations arising from, relating to or at issue in the [Connecticut Case].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 8-11. The Agreement does not provide for any payments to be made by either party.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Regarding the Russian Enforcement Proceeding, section 4 of the Agreement specifies that the parties shall\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   within forty-five business days of the Settlement Agreement becoming effective, ... execute and exchange, through their respective counsel, any documents sufficient and necessary to dismiss and discontinue all such actions and proceedings with prejudice, with each of the Parties to bear its own costs and attorneys' fees pertaining to such actions and proceedings, and withdrawing any and all claims, motions, subpoenas, liens, costs, fees, and any other legal process pertaining to such actions and proceedings with prejudice and without costs.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 4. Section 4 also provides that \"[i]n the meantime, neither party shall take any actions with respect to any of the Foreign Enforcement Proceedings and/or the Principal Russian Debt other than those designed to effectuate the dismissal with prejudice and discontinuance of such proceedings and/or those contemplated and intended by Section 7 of this Settlement Agreement.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Settlement Agreement includes as section 29 the following provision:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   [t]he parties agree that the above is the full and complete agreement between the parties. The parties recognize that they have not agreed on how the above agreement impacts on the manner of terminating the [Russian Enforcement Proceeding], pending before the Russian Bailiff Service, or the fees imposed by the Russian Bailiff Service. The parties agree, however, that the impact of this manner of termination and of these fees is not a material term of the above agreement, that the above agreement is enforceable notwithstanding the dispute regarding the manner of termination and the fees imposed by the Russian Bailiff Service, and that either party may seek to resolve these issues by appropriate means, including an application to the Court in\n   <em>\n    Chigirinskiy v. Panchenkova\n   </em>\n   , 14 Civ. 4410 (S.D.N.Y.) (JPO) (GWG) to enforce the above agreement.

This stipulation provided that \"[t]his Court shall retain jurisdiction to enforce the Settlement Agreement ... and to resolve any disputes arising from or relating to [it].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4. Around the same time, Panchenkova's counsel advised the Court that the parties intended to resolve the remaining issues mentioned in section 29 by a motion to enforce the Settlement Agreement, for which the parties had agreed to a briefing schedule.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Letter from Jeffrey M.

On March 7, 2018, Chigirinskiy's counsel wrote to the Court stating that a hearing in an enforcement proceeding in which Panchenkova sought to recover Chigirinskiy's half shares in the St. Petersburg apartments was scheduled for March 12, 2018.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Letter from George Benaur, filed Mar. 7, 2018 (Docket # 301) (\"Emergency Application Letter\"), at 2. The letter stated that although Panchenkova's Russian lawyer, Larisa Ryabchenko, originally proposed adjourning this hearing until the parties resolved how to terminate the Russian Enforcement Proceeding, Panchenkova's counsel in this action instead stated on March 1, 2018, that Panchenkova intended to \"make an application to the court bailiff to return the writs of execution [at the March 12, 2018 hearing], which will lead to termination of the enforcement proceeding\" unless Chigirinskiy agreed to a different dismissal protocol that he was sent earlier by Panchenkova.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The impetus of this demand was, according to Panchenkova's counsel, Panchenkova's desire to comply with section 4 of the Settlement Agreement's requirement that the Russian Enforcement Proceeding be terminated.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 3. In a letter to this Court, Chigirinskiy's counsel stated that he would respond by \"fil[ing] a formal motion for a TRO\" if need be, but that he simply sought to \"hold the status quo pending Your Honor's ruling under the section 29 procedure which you suggested and ordered.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Panchenkova's counsel responded that he had proposed to Chigirinskiy's counsel that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   unless and until there is either an agreement between the parties on the method\n   of termination, or Judge Gorenstein's decision on the motion, [Panchenkova] will not ask the bailiff to return the writs of execution, and [Chigirinskiy] shall have no claim against [Panchenkova] (for breach of the Settlement Agreement or otherwise) in connection with her failure to take any affirmative steps to terminate the enforcement proceeding in Russia.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Letter from Vitali S.

According to Chigirinskiy's Russian counsel, however, Panchenkova's Russian counsel sought to recover Chigirinskiy's half-interests in the three St. Petersburg apartments at this hearing prior to the adjournment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Povolotskiy Decl. \u00b6 25.

[that Panchenkova must] pay the Bailiff's Fees and ... compensate [Chigirinskiy] for the fees and costs associated with this Motion.\" Pl. Mem. at 22 (emphasis in original). Panchenkova\n   seeks a declaratory judgment from this Court stating that pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, she \"does not owe any payment to [Chigirinskiy] or on his behalf in connection with any proceedings in Russia.\" Def. Mem. at 16. Panchenkova also argues that Chigirinskiy \"should bear the costs of this motion, including attorneys' fees\" because \"this entire motion practice was necessitated by nothing but [his] baseless and unreasonable insistence that [Panchenkova] should pay the Russian Bailiff Fees instead of him.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.

Mem. at 9-11; Pl. Mem. at 19-20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   As an initial matter, we reject Panchenkova's argument, Def. Mem. at 5-9, that the issue of which party owes the Bailiff's Fee is outside of the scope of the Agreement. Section 29 states \"[a]ny application to resolve the disagreement over the manner of termination of the proceeding pending before the Russian Bailiff Service or the fees imposed by the Russian Bailiff Service shall be resolved by examining the intent of the parties as expressed in the above agreement.\" Settlement Agreement \u00a7 29. This provision establishes that the issue of liability for the Bailiff's Fee is governed by the terms of the Agreement. This section even provides a mechanism for resolving a dispute over which party owes the Bailiff's Fee - that is, by dictating that \"either party may seek to resolve these issues by appropriate means, including an application to the Court in\n   <em>\n    Chigirinskiy v. Panchenkova\n   </em>\n   , 14 Civ. 4410 (S.D.N.Y.) (JPO) (GWG) to enforce the above agreement.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12280853\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/29/313/#p331\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In light of this provision, the issue of which party owes the Bailiff's Fee is plainly within the scope of the Settlement Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Panchenkova points to the portion of section 29 of the Settlement Agreement providing that the parties \" 'recognize that they have not agreed ... on the manner of terminating the ... Enforcement Proceeding ... pending before the Russian Bailiff Service, or the fees imposed by the Russian Bailiff Service' - and expressly agreed 'that the impact of this manner of termination and of these fees is not a material term of the above agreement.' \" Def. Mem. at 8 (quoting Settlement Agreement \u00a7 29). Contrary to Panchenkova's argument, however, this provision does not suggest that the Russian Enforcement Proceeding issues are outside the scope of the Settlement Agreement. Rather, it reflects only that the parties agree it is not a \"material term.\" Section 29's acknowledgment that the allocation of the Bailiff's Fee is not a \"material\" term of the agreement operates to ensure that the Settlement Agreement is enforceable notwithstanding\n   the failure to designate which party must bear the Fee.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ciaramella v. Reader's Digest Ass'n, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11887317\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/131/320/#p325\">\n    131 F.3d 320\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 325 (2d Cir. 1997) (settlement agreement may not be binding where the parties fail to agree to \"all material terms.\"). In sum, far from suggesting that the Russian Enforcement Proceeding issues are outside the agreement, section 29 makes clear that these issues were actually governed by the Settlement Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Turning to the question of whether Panchenkova is obligated to pay the Bailiff's Fee, section 4 of the Agreement states \"each of the Parties [shall] bear its own costs and attorneys' fees\" arising from the Russian Enforcement Proceeding. Both parties seem to assume that this statement controls which party must pay the Fee. Chigirinskiy argues that because Panchenkova initiated this action, she should pay the Bailiff's Fee because this Fee should be considered \"an extension of the legal fees incurred by [Panchenkova].\" Pl. Mem. at 6. Panchenkova argues that, pursuant to this section, \"the Parties walk away from their claims, they do not pay or owe anything to each other, and each of the parties will deal with its own costs, fees, and other third party charges,\" including the Bailiff's Fee. Def. Mem. at 7. Neither party, however, attempts to explain what is meant by the phrase \"costs and attorneys' fees,\" which is not defined in the Settlement Agreement. Thus, it is not clear whether the Bailiff's Fee can be considered \"costs and attorneys' fees\" under the Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Other than section 4, only the release provisions concern the parties' obligations for liabilities arising from their prior litigation. Section 8 contains Chigirinskiy's release. It states that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   [e]xcept for the representations made and obligations arising under this Settlement Agreement and any claims or obligations arising from, relating to or at issue in the [Connecticut Case], [Chigirinskiy] hereby releases ... any and all damages, debts, judgments, claims, complaints, suits, or causes of action, known or unknown, against [Panchenkova] ... that ... [Chigirinskiy] ever had, now have, or hereafter can, shall or may have .... from the beginning of the world to the day of execution of this Settlement Agreement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Settlement Agreement \u00a7 8. In other words, pursuant to this section, Chigirinskiy released all claims that he had against Panchenkova except for those claims arising from the Connecticut Case or enforcement of the Settlement Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The parties have not suggested that any other provisions may be relevant to the question of which party is obligated by the Settlement Agreement to bear the Bailiff's Fee; nor has the Court's review of the Settlement Agreement revealed any other relevant provisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   We conclude that, when read together, sections 4 and 8 reflect that Panchenkova is not obligated under the terms of the Settlement Agreement to pay any part of the Bailiff's Fee. These provisions relieve the parties of any financial obligations to each other from then-existing litigation, including this case, except for narrow carve-outs relating to the Connecticut Case and enforcement of this Agreement, which are not at issue in this motion. The parties do not dispute that under Russian law, the Bailiff's Fee is the obligation of the debtor - here, Chigirinskiy. Indeed, the parties' Russian law experts agree that the Bailiff's Fee is currently Chigirinskiy's obligation to the Russian Federation, though one calls it a \"monetary penalty\" and the other calls it a \"sanction.\" Ryabchenko Decl. \u00b6 8; Rachkov Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 20-21. Notably, a recital in the Settlement Agreement itself refers to the Bailiff's Fee as\n   Chigirinskiy's \"current indebtedness to the Russian Bailiff Service.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Settlement Agreement at 3. If, as the parties assume, this Fee constitutes \"costs\" or \"attorneys' fees\" within the meaning of section 4 of the Agreement, the combination of that section with the recital makes clear that the obligation to pay the fee is Chigirinskiy's, not Panchenkova's. We thus reject Chigirinskiy's argument that the Bailiff's Fee should in fact be considered Panchenkova's \"legal fees\" under the Settlement Agreement because she \"started the proceedings.\" Pl. Mem. at 6. This argument is completely unconnected to any provision of the Settlement Agreement and is at odds with the ordinary meaning of the term \"legal fees.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Even if the Bailiff's Fee is not a \"cost or attorneys' fee\" within the meaning of section 4, the same result ensues. Under section 8 of the Agreement, Chigirinskiy released any claim against Panchenkova regarding any obligation that arose prior to the signing of the Settlement Agreement. It is undisputed that the obligation had already arisen at the time the Settlement Agreement was signed because it is specifically referenced in the Settlement Agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Settlement Agreement at 3. And the obligation, of course, is not one that Chigirinskiy owes to Panchenkova - which would have been extinguished by Panchenkova's release in section 10 - but rather an obligation he owes to the Russian Federation, a nonparty to the Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Chigirinskiy counters that \"[g]iven the 'walk-away' nature of the agreed settlement, where [Chigirinskiy] was to have 'no financial obligations,' it is clearly right to treat the Bailiff's fees as deriving from [Panchenkova's] claims.\" Def. Mem. at 6.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   But the question of who should bear fees \"derive[d] from\" a party's claims is not addressed in the Settlement Agreement. Rather, the Settlement Agreement addresses only costs and fees that are actually in existence at the time of the Settlement Agreement without reference to how they came into being. Additionally, the phrase \"no financial obligations\" is not contained in the Settlement Agreement, notwithstanding the fact that Chigirinskiy puts the phrase in quotation marks. Rather, the phrase comes from a statement his counsel made in an email to Panchenkova's counsel,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Email Exchange Between Jeffrey M. Eilender and George Benaur, dated Sept. 15, 2017, and Nov. 15, 2017 (annexed as Ex. 1 to Eilender Decl.), which we are not permitted to consider given the clear and unambiguous terms of the Settlement Agreement. In any event, it is a misquotation inasmuch as the email from Chigirinskiy's counsel stated, in a separate sentence, \"[n]o financial\n   <em>\n    conditions\n   </em>\n   \" (not \"obligations\").\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11887317\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/131/320/#p325\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). Chigirinskiy's counsel also fails to explain why a settlement agreement imposing \"no financial conditions\" or \"obligations\" should be read to absolve Chigirinskiy of his financial obligation to a\n   <em>\n    nonparty\n   </em>\n   (that is, the Russian Federation), let alone why it should be read to impose an obligation on Panchenkova.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Chigirinskiy argues that Panchenkova should pay the Bailiff's Fee \"as a result of her abuse of process and deceitful conduct.\" Pl. Mem. at 19-20. Chigirinskiy also argues that Panchenkova should pay the Bailiff's Fee because his \"name should be cleared in Russia.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6. Chigirinskiy fails to show how either of these arguments\n   relate to any term of the Settlement Agreement, or indeed, any legal doctrine whatsoever. We thus reject them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Lastly, Chigirinskiy asserts that, as contended by his Russian legal expert, the Bailiff's Fee \"can ... be paid by a third party[.]\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Mem. at 19 (citing Rachkov Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 23-29). However, this statement supports only the proposition that, as Chigirinskiy's expert later puts it, \"the imposition of the Bailiff's fee on the debtor does not\n   <em>\n    preclude\n   </em>\n   payment of the fee by a third party.\" Rachkov Decl. \u00b6 23 (emphasis added). The question at issue, however, is not whether Panchenkova \"can\" pay the Bailiff's Fee under Russian law, but rather whether the Settlement Agreement requires her to do so. For the reasons we have already stated, the Settlement Agreement does not so require her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   At its essence, Chigirinskiy's position rests on his view that he \"should not have any remaining financial obligations under this settlement.\" Pl. Mem. at 6. The flaw in Chigirinskiy's argument, however, is that the Settlement Agreement provides only that he will \"not have any remaining financial obligations\"\n   <em>\n    to Panchenkova\n   </em>\n   . It does not address the question of whether he will have financial obligations to others, including financial obligations - such as the Bailiff's Fee - that were created by Panchenkova's actions. Because the Settlement Agreement contains no provision requiring Panchenkova to bear this Fee, Chigirinskiy's request for an Order requiring Panchenkova to do so is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Dismissal With or Without Prejudice\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Chigirinskiy argues that the Settlement Agreement requires Panchenkova to dismiss the Russian Enforcement Proceeding with prejudice and that to do so she would have to use one of the methods proposed by his Russian legal expert: that is, (1) waiving the right to collect the debt from Chigirinskiy; or (2) obtaining the Russian court's approval of a settlement or conciliation agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Mem. at 10-11 (citing Rachkov Decl. \u00b6 46). Panchenkova does not address this argument directly but instead asserts that \"the only way [Chigirinskiy] may avoid paying the Bailiff Fees under Russian law is to agree to have the Enforcement Proceeding terminated\" in a manner that would result in dismissal of the Russian Enforcement Proceeding without prejudice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.

This method, according to Panchenkova's Russian legal expert, would require Chigirinskiy to convey to Panchenkova his one-half interest in the three St. Petersburg apartments in partial execution of the debt Chigirinskiy owes her.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Reply at 8. The bailiff would then terminate the Enforcement Proceeding without initiating a separate proceeding to collect the Bailiff's Fee because Chigirinskiy would have no assets in Russia from which the bailiff could collect the Fee.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   (citing Ryabchenko Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 31-34).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   We need not dwell on this dispute because the Settlement Agreement unambiguously requires dismissal of the Russian Enforcement Proceeding \"with prejudice.\" Settlement Agreement \u00a7 4. Indeed, Panchenkova does not dispute that pursuant to this provision she must terminate the Russian Enforcement Proceeding with prejudice. Instead, she argues that dismissal without prejudice would be in the parties' best interests because it would permit the parties to avoid the imposition of the Bailiff's Fee.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Mem. at 13-16. That consideration is unconnected to the terms of the Settlement Agreement, however, and thus we leave it to the parties to determine whether they would prefer to stipulate to amend the Settlement Agreement to allow for a dismissal without prejudice. As to which method of dismissal\n   with prejudice should be used, Chigirinskiy has not asked this Court to issue an order requiring that Panchenkova use a particular method. Thus, we do not address this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   We note that Panchenkova objects that the methods of dismissal proposed by Chigirinskiy's expert \"are very problematic to implement, and also fail to comply with Section 4 of the Settlement Agreement, because neither of these methods can possibly procure termination of the Enforcement Proceedings within 45 business days as Section 4 requires.\" Def.

Panchenkova, however, admits that dismissal of the Russian Enforcement Proceeding with prejudice within 45 days is possible, albeit by a method different than the ones proposed by Chigirinskiy's expert.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Supp. Mem. at 7-8. Again, it is not necessary to resolve this dispute because no party has asked us to determine which method of dismissal with prejudice is required by the Settlement Agreement. However, we do note that one of Panchenkova's objections to Chigirinskiy's proposed methods is unfounded because it misreads the Settlement Agreement. The Settlement Agreement does not require the parties to achieve dismissal with prejudice within 45 business days as Panchenkova argues. Rather, it requires that, within 45 business days, the parties \"execute and exchange ... any documents sufficient and necessary\" to effectuate such dismissal. Settlement Agreement \u00a7 4. In other words, it is the execution and exchange of documents, rather than the dismissal with prejudice, that must occur within 45 business days of the Settlement Agreement's execution. Inasmuch as Rachkov's proposed methods of dismissal are otherwise \"problematic,\" Def. Reply at 11, Panchenkova fails to explain how such issues would relieve any party of its obligation to exchange such documents as required by the Settlement Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   In sum, the Court grants Chigirinskiy's motion seeking a declaration that the Settlement Agreement requires dismissal with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Breach and Fees\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Both parties seek to recover their fees, costs, and expenses arising from the instant motion pursuant to section 25 of the Settlement Agreement.

Mem. at 16; (ii) threatening to dismiss the Russian Enforcement Proceeding by withdrawing Panchenkova's writs of execution prior to this Court's ruling on the instant motion, which Chigirinskiy also argues constitutes contempt of court,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 17; (iii) hiding the Settlement Agreement from the Russian court presiding over the Enforcement Proceeding on March 12, 2018,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 5; and (iv) attempting to recover Chigirinskiy's half-ownership of the St. Petersburg apartments during that hearing,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 5, 16. We reject each of these claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   First, Panchenkova has not breached the contract by failing to dismiss the Russian Enforcement Proceeding with prejudice within 45 days of the Settlement Agreement's execution. This is because section 4 imposes an obligation on \"the Parties,\" not just Panchenkova, to execute and exchange documents within 45 days of the Agreement's execution that are sufficient to effect dismissal with prejudice. Whatever actions Panchenkova was required to take to fulfill her obligation, in her letter to the Court dated March 7, 2018, Panchenkova offered that \"unless and until there is either an agreement between the parties on the method of termination, or Judge Gorenstein's decision on the motion, [Panchenkova] will not ask the bailiff to return the writs of execution, and [Chigirinskiy] shall have no claim against [Panchenkova] (for breach of the Settlement Agreement or otherwise) in connection with her failure to take any affirmative steps to terminate the enforcement proceeding in Russia.\" Rosenfeld Mar. 7 Letter at 2. Chigirinskiy responded that \"[t]hese representations from [Panchenkova]'s counsel are sufficient to resolve the immediate issue raised in my letter.\" Benaur Mar. 8 Letter at 1. As pointed out by Panchenkova, she detrimentally relied on this assurance by abandoning any attempt to comply with her interpretation of section 4 by dismissing the Russian Enforcement Proceeding within 45 days.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Reply at 15-16. No finding of breach is appropriate because Chigirinskiy is estopped from claiming that Panchenkova is responsible for the failure to take any action during this period. As the New York Court of Appeals has held, estoppel is appropriate \"in the interest of fairness to prevent the enforcement of rights which would work fraud or injustice upon the person against whom enforcement is sought and who, in justifiable reliance upon the opposing party's words or conduct, has been misled into acting upon the belief that such enforcement would not be sought.\"\n   <em>\n    Nassau Tr.

Panchenkova never actually carried out that threat. Nor has Chigirinskiy argued - let alone shown - that this \"threat\" was sufficiently definite to constitute an anticipatory repudiation.\n   <em>\n    Rachmani Corp. v. 9 E. 96th St. Apartment Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1198394\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad2d/211/262/#p267\">\n    211 A.D.2d 262\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 267,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1198394\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad2d/211/262/#p267\">\n    629 N.Y.S.2d 382\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1st Dep't 1995) (\"[T]here must be a definite and final communication of the intention to forego [sic] performance before the anticipated breach may be the subject of legal action.\"). Indeed, the parties resolved this dispute without court intervention, as described above. Moreover, because this threat did not violate a Court order, it cannot form a basis on which to find Panchenkova in contempt of court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Third, Chigirinskiy claims that Panchenkova breached the Settlement Agreement by \"hid[ing]\" the Settlement Agreement from the Russian Enforcement Proceeding court \"even as late as the last hearing there held on March 12, 2018.\" Pl. Mem. at 5. Chigirinskiy does not identify a provision of the Settlement Agreement that was breached by Panchenkova's actions,\n   however. Thus, this claim of breach is rejected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Finally, we reject Chigirinskiy's assertion that Panchenkova breached the agreement because she \"tried to take\" Chigirinskiy's half-shares in the St. Petersburg apartments during a hearing in the Russian Enforcement Proceeding on March 12, 2018.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5, 16. Chigirinskiy argues, Pl. Mem. at 16, that this action breached section 4 of the Settlement Agreement, requiring Panchenkova to \"withdraw[ ] any and all claims, motions, subpoenas, liens, costs, fees, and any other legal process pertaining to\" the Russian Enforcement Proceeding, and section 11, which requires Panchenkova \"not to ... maintain any legal action or proceeding in any jurisdiction against\" Chigirinskiy. However, Panchenkova's counsel later withdrew this motion at a hearing held April 3, 2018,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Court Ruling, translation certificate dated Apr. 10, 2018 (annexed as Ex. 2 to Ryabchenko Reply Decl.), at 1, an action that Chigirinskiy's counsel in this action acknowledged was done \"in compliance with the requirements of Section 4 of the Settlement Agreement,\" Email from George Benaur to Vitali Rosenfeld, dated Apr. 5, 2018 (annexed as Ex. 3 to Ryabchenko Reply Decl.). Accordingly, whatever action occurred on March 12, 2018, achieved no legal effect and we thus do not deem it to constitute a breach of the Settlement Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Panchenkova's Request\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   In attempting to collect the costs and fees incurred in making this motion, Panchenkova argues that because \"this entire motion practice was necessitated by nothing but [Chigirinskiy's] baseless and unreasonable insistence that [Panchenkova] should pay the Russian Bailiff Fees instead of him,\" Chigirinskiy should be required to pay Panchenkova's costs and attorneys' fees. Def. Reply at 18 n.9. But Panchenkova fails to allege - let alone demonstrate - that Chigirinskiy's refusal to pay the Bailiff's Fee constitutes a breach of the Settlement Agreement. Thus, we can find no breach on this basis, and Chigirinskiy is not obligated to pay Panchenkova's costs and fees incurred in bringing this motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   In sum, because neither side is a \"breaching Party,\" neither side owes costs or attorneys' fees incurred in bringing these cross-motions to the other side pursuant to section 25 of the Settlement Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   IV.\n   <em>\n    MOTION TO SEAL\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Panchenkova moves to seal portions of the parties' briefs that reference the Settlement Agreement, as well as sections of the Settlement Agreement itself.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.

The remaining matters covered by the Settlement Agreement, including the property dispute between the parties, might otherwise have seemed matters entitled to protection. That is not the case here, however, because significant information concerning the parties' interpersonal dispute was long ago disclosed in Chigirinskiy's unsealed complaint, including the second amended complaint,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    generally\n   </em>\n   SAC (discussing division of marital property), and Panchenkova's unsealed answer to that complaint,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Am.

However, Panchenkova's sole argument in favor of sealing these provisions is that she \"has been the subject of false, misleading and biased articles in the Russian press speculating about her assets and her disputes with [Chigirinskiy],\" and that she accordingly \"has a serious interest in protecting herself and her children from such baseless attacks in the future.\" Def.

Such a confidentiality provision, however, cannot in and of itself be sufficient to overcome the presumption of public access.

The only exception will be the references to the court proceeding we have referred to as the \"Connecticut Case\" (as distinguished from the \"Connecticut Enforcement Action\" referenced in the Settlement Agreement) and the detailed description of the parties' Divorce Decree. These matters are referred to or contained in the following provisions of the Settlement Agreement: (1) the second recital paragraph, (2) the ninth recital paragraph, (3) section 5, and (4) scattered references in sections 4, 8, 9, 10 and 11 to the Connecticut Case. We permit the sealing of these portions of the Settlement Agreement because these portions involve nonparties with a strong privacy interest and have no bearing on the adjudication of the instant motions. Case law has held that \"the privacy interests of innocent third parties ... should weigh heavily in a court's balancing equation in determining what portions of motion papers in question should remain sealed or should be redacted.\"\n   <em>\n    Matter of N.Y.
