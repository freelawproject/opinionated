I denied the Government's first motion to dismiss-despite its claim that further searching for the emails would futile-reasoning that search efforts thus far had been anemic, and that the Plaintiff had shown a substantial likelihood that the emails could be recovered.\n   <em>\n    Cause of Action Inst. v.

But the Defendants have since engaged in significant additional efforts to find the emails, ultimately securing detailed assurances from both Secretary Powell and AOL's successor company that recovery of the emails is technologically impossible. I therefore conclude that the case is moot, since it is only speculation to think that referral to the Attorney General might remedy the Plaintiff's inability to access Secretary Powell's emails through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). I will grant the Government's Motion to Dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Decl. of Joshua L. Dorosin (Dorosin Decl.) Ex. M, ECF No. 32-2 at 40. Secretary Powell provided the requested letters. In the first, he stated \"under penalty of perjury\" that (a) he did not \"have possession of or access to any federal records ... that may not otherwise be preserved in the [State] Department's record-keeping system;\" (b) he did not \"have possession of or access to any laptops or any other devices [he] used to send, receive, or access work-related email using a personal email account;\" (c) he \"did not use any non-governmental email accounts other than the AOL account;\" and (d) he was \"not aware of any locations outside of the [State] Department's record-keeping systems where work-related emails sent or received via [his] personal email account may exist.\" Dorosin Decl. Ex. N, ECF 32-2 at 43. In the second, Secretary Powell gave the State Department written permission to obtain from \"Oath Inc, formerly known as AOL,\" any emails sent or received on his former AOL email account. Dorosin Decl. Ex. O, ECF No. 32-2 at 45.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Next, the Government contacted Oath in March 2018, asking for written confirmation that Secretary Powell's emails could not be recovered, and for an explanation as to whether it would be \"technologically possible to recover them (and if not, why).\" Dorosin Decl. Ex. P, ECF No. 32-2 at 47. Later in March, Oath replied with a letter and an email. The Senior Manager for Oath's Law Enforcement Response Team, Karen Vukson, sent a letter stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Despite a diligent search, we have found no email content related to the AOL account of [Secretary Powell's email address]. This includes mail sent to, received by, or stored in the account. This was determined by a thorough search of all mail storage databases maintained by Oath Inc. The search included both the active mailbox database and short-term temporary storage for accounts that are in an inactive or closed state. Furthermore, it is not technologically possible to recover any of the data being sought as it has been several years since the email content was removed from the Oath network of databases.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Dorosin Decl. Ex. Q, ECF No 32-2 at 49.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Oath's Deputy General Counsel, Jeffrey Novak, also sent an email stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   As confirmed to House Committee staff previously, AOL does not have any emails from the period of Secretary\n   Powell's service at the Department of State.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   This is not unusual. During this time period, there were several automated network storage settings on AOL email accounts including a limitation on the storage of emails in the New (unread emails) folder and time-limited storage/automatic deletion of emails in the Old (read emails) and Sent folders. The initial default retention period for read emails was 7 days; that was later adjusted to 30 days. The default retention period for sent emails was 30 days. Users could store email indefinitely in a Personal Filing Cabinet on the user's hard drive or by manually moving the email to a personal network folder. However, we are unable to determine from our records whether a user has elected to store information in a Personal Filing Cabinet.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Dorosin Decl. Ex.

ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Here, the Government's evidence satisfies that high bar. Secretary Powell has personally signed a statement, under penalty of perjury, eliminating himself and any of his devices as sources for the missing emails. Dorosin Decl. Ex. N, ECF 32-2 at 43. Neither can the emails be obtained directly from the service provider. Oath Inc., the successor company to AOL, has explained that it is \"not technologically possible to recover any of the data being sought.\" Dorosin Decl. Ex. Q, ECF No 32-2 at 49. Oath reached this conclusion after searching \"all mail storage databases maintained by Oath Inc,\" including \"both the active mailbox database and short-term temporary storage for accounts that are in an inactive or closed state.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12522911\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/285/201/#p208\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \"It has been several years since the email content was removed from the Oath network of databases,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12522911\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/285/201/#p208\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , because of network settings in effect for \"AOL email accounts.\" Dorosin Decl. Ex. R, ECF No. 32-2 at 51. To the best of its knowledge, Oath \"does not have any emails from the period of Secretary Powell's service at the Department of State.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12522911\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/285/201/#p208\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   That sounds like fatal loss. I credit the statements of information technology executives about the retrievability of emails on their servers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Cause of Action does not contest most of these facts. It admits that \"this Court has long known that Secretary Powell no longer has access to his AOL account or the devices he used during his tenure at the State Department,\" and omits any argument that Secretary Powell could himself be a source of lost emails. Pls.' Reply at 6. Instead, its core contention is that the Defendants have \"never explained\" why forensically searching \"the physical servers on which AOL's databases are housed,\" would fail to find some missing emails. Pls.' Reply at 6-8. But that solution-forensically searching the physical servers of a large company-would be like embarking on a search \"for specific grains of sand on a beach,\"\n   <em>\n    Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Tillerson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523676\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/293/33/#p44\">\n    293 F.Supp.3d 33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 44 (D.D.C. 2017) (\n   <em>\n    Judicial Watch II\n   </em>\n   ), without even knowing if the relevant grains of sand still exist. The Plaintiff has no evidence that Secretary Powell's emails could be found by forensic searches, apart from the fact that forensic searches discovered emails in former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's case, when \"others had believed [them] to be deleted or unrecoverable.\"\n   <em>\n    Cause of Action\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12522911\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/285/201/#p208\">\n    285 F.Supp.3d at 209\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But that case involved forensic searches of a limited set of\n   <em>\n    personal\n   </em>\n   servers and devices that Secretary Clinton had used, and \"took months.\"\n   <em>\n    Judicial Watch II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523676\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/293/33/#p44\">\n    293 F.Supp.3d at 43-44\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Forensically searching an information technology company's servers for AOL data, after Oath's law enforcement team has concluded that\n   <em>\n    none\n   </em>\n   of the relevant data is technologically accessible, Dorosin Decl. Ex. Q, ECF No 32-2 at 49, is a wild goose chase and a waste of time. Any such hopes are only speculative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The rest of the Plaintiff's counter-arguments are even weaker. It contends that the email from Oath's Deputy General Counsel failed \"to connect AOL's default settings to Secretary Powell's account in any way,\" or to give any details about Oath's search methods. Pl.'s Reply 8. But the email began by saying that Oath had none of Secretary Powell's AOL emails, and then explained AOL's network settings for \"AOL email accounts.\" And the purpose of the email was not to explain Oath's search methods; Oath's law enforcement team had already done so in a previous letter. Dorosin Decl. Ex. Q, ECF No 32-2 at 49. Cause of Action also argues that the Government's decision to ask Secretary Powell for permission to access his AOL emails, when that legal authority allegedly already existed, somehow \"casts doubt on the adequacy of [the Government's]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   efforts.\" Pl.'s Reply 7. Even if the Plaintiff is right about the Defendants' existing legal authority, obtaining Secretary Powell's permission merely bolsters that power. And in any event, the State Department\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   contact Oath directly, removing that objection to the adequacy of its search efforts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   By establishing that Secretary Powell's missing emails cannot be obtained through Secretary Powell himself, his devices, or his service provider, the Government has established the fatal loss of these federal records. Although Cause of Action suggests that the Attorney General could begin a forensic search of Oath's physical servers to find the lost data, success in that endeavor is speculative, not likely. As with Secretary Clinton's emails, the remote possibility of success is made even more remote because the emails may not exist, and the Government questions whether the Attorney General would have a legal basis for ordering such a search.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Judicial Watch II\n   </em>\n   , 293 F.Supp.3d at 44\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Cross-Reply at 1, 4. With these federal records apparently fatally lost, I perceive no substantial likelihood that referral to the Attorney General will yield any fruit. This case is therefore moot, and must be dismissed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   For these reasons, the Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment will be denied and the Government's Motion to Dismiss will be granted. A separate order will issue.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    Because of this disposition, I do not reach the Defendants' alternative argument-which my previous opinion rejected in substance-that they are entitled to summary judgment because of full compliance with the Federal Records Act.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Defs.'
