(\"U.S. Auto\") to convert the temporary restraining order to a preliminary injunction. U.S. Auto is a publicly traded company incorporated in Delaware and headquartered in Carson, California. Plaintiff initiated this action to contest the imposition of an enhanced single entry bond requirement in the amount of three times the entire shipment value on each container of merchandise imported by U.S. Auto (\"SEB Requirement\"), which U.S. Customs and Border Protection (\"Customs\") mandated in response to Plaintiff's continued importation of goods alleged to infringe trademarks in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201124\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1124\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201526\">\n    19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1526\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e). The treble bond requirement, enforced against each of U.S. Auto's shipments, resulted in a single entry bond totaling approximately $9 million at the time Customs imposed the SEB Requirement. This is in contrast to the previous continuous bond of $200,000 for all of U.S. Auto's annual shipments. Because the court determines that Plaintiff has met its burden of proof with respect to the requisite four factors, the motion for preliminary injunction is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The court presumes familiarity with the facts of this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    U.S. Auto Parts Network, Inc. v.

Rule 65(a) of the Rules of this Court allows for the issuance of a preliminary injunction in an action. USCIT R. 65(a).

These factors are: (1) whether the party will incur irreparable harm in the absence of such injunction; (2) whether the party is likely to succeed on the merits of the action; (3) whether the balance of hardships favors the imposition of the injunction; and (4) whether the injunction is in the public interest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wind Tower Trade Coal. v.

Plaintiff's witness testified that without the relief granted in a preliminary injunction, \"those suppliers will be forced to go and ... offer their capacity to other retailers or our competitors.

Because inventory continues to grow, the bond value required also increases, due to the nature of a single-entry bond.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 47-48 (\"The bond amount is a point in time. So it all depends on how much inventory is there. But, remember, inventory grows each week, so it required new bonding.\"). U.S. Auto was not able to post the $9 million bond because various sureties required full cash collateral for the bond.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 49-50 (Mr. Coleman's testimony), 127-29 (Mr. Roberts' testimony).

Given the difficulties that U.S. Auto faced in paying the exorbitant SEB Requirement, the company's \"inability to predict\" Customs' actions, and \"the disruption that this has caused\" the business, Mr. Coleman stated that U.S. Auto has stopped importing vehicle grilles completely, which represents \"roughly $8 million\" of the company's annual revenue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 46.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Based on the credible testimony proffered at the hearing, the court concludes that Plaintiff has adequately shown irreparable harm in support of its motion for injunctive relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

In addition to the significant financial burden and business disruption caused by the SEB Requirement, as discussed above, Plaintiff's witness described at the hearing how U.S. Auto struggled to alter its importation plans and supply chain in order to comply with the demands of Customs officers at the Port of Norfolk. Mr. Coleman testified that U.S. Auto has a \"very large and complex supply chain\" with \"over 350 different factories,\" which results in a \"long time between when we send an order for something to be removed from future orders before it is actually removed across the entire supply chain.\" Hr'g Tr. 32.

The court considers whether the agency \"entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem, offered an explanation for its decision that runs counter to the evidence before the agency, or is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise.\"\n   <em>\n    Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

Cir. 2009) (stating the same).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Customs' own directive provides guidance in determining the amount of a bond. The directive states, in relevant part, \"The purpose of the bond is to protect the revenue and ensure compliance.... However, it is not Customs\n   <em>\n    [sic]\n   </em>\n   intent to require bond amounts which unnecessarily put an excessive burden on a person or firm, or place them in an impossible situation.\" Compl. Ex. E, at 2, Apr. 5, 2018, ECF No. 17-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Here, the single entry triple bond contravenes the directive by placing an excessive burden on U.S. Auto and by placing it\n   in an arguably near-impossible position. The court notes that the Government previously represented to the court that approximately 99% of the goods imported by U.S. Auto are not implicated by Customs' counterfeit allegations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Teleconference at 0:42:55-0:43:06, Apr. 6, 2018, ECF No. 19. The Government confirmed further that the SEB Requirement seeks to ensure compliance with respect to only 1% of U.S. Auto's (allegedly infringing) shipments, but burdens all of U.S. Auto's imports.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Mr. Laria testified that he has served as Area Port Director for the Port of Norfolk for seventeen years.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hr'g Tr. 145. He also testified that he made the decision to impose the SEB Requirement on U.S. Auto, which he had never done before to any other importer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 185. Mr. Laria stated that he imposed the SEB Requirement on U.S. Auto \"[b]ecause [he] was 39 seizures into it, ten months into it, and they kept coming with those goods.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 215. Mr. Laria apparently did not take into account the fact that U.S. Auto was attempting to ameliorate the situation by issuing stop-shipment orders to its suppliers around the world, and that U.S. Auto had stopped importing grilles altogether. Mr. Laria apparently also did not take into account the fact that the enhanced triple bond applied to 100% of the shipment value while directed to only 1% of infringing goods in each container. Mr. Laria noted during his testimony that U.S. Auto had informed Customs that there are \"just a few pieces [of infringing goods] in each container.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 207. Mr. Laria represented during his testimony in court that he did not know that the SEB Requirement would cause U.S. Auto, a publicly traded U.S.-based company, to go out of business at the time of imposition, but when he did learn of the fact, he kept the requirement in place nonetheless.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Customs' action of imposing an enhanced, punitive bond on 100% of Plaintiff's imports, when only 1% of the goods are allegedly counterfeit, appears to contravene Customs' own directive. It places an excessive burden on U.S. Auto and places it in an arguably impossible position that will likely cause the company to go out of business if it were to pay the enhanced bond. The court concludes, at this juncture of the case, that Plaintiff has raised meritorious claims against Defendants with respect to Counts I and II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Count III: Excessive Fines\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   U.S. Auto claims that the SEB Requirement constitutes a punitive bond requirement and is unconstitutional as excessive under the Excessive Fines Clause enumerated in the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 75. It is unclear whether an enhanced bond, which an importer posts as security for entry of its imported merchandise, constitutes a punitive measure within the meaning of the Eighth Amendment. The court concludes that Plaintiff has not met its burden of proof at this stage of the litigation with respect to Count III of its complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Count IV: Due Process\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Plaintiff further contends that Customs' imposition of the SEB Requirement \"without giving U.S. Auto the opportunity to challenge the underlying factual and legal determinations judicially or the ability to challenge the bond requirement is contrary to the law\" and amounts to a violation of the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 76-81.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The Fifth Amendment prohibits the deprivation of life, liberty, or property without due process of law.

Plaintiff showed at the Preliminary Injunction Hearing, however, that the prospective harms described at the temporary restraining order stage of this action have now come to fruition, especially with regard to employment of its U.S.-based employees.
