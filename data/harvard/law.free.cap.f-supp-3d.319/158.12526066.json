Plaintiffs are two Democratic National Committee (\"DNC\") donors (Cockrum and Schoenberg) and a former DNC employee (Comer). Defendants are Donald J. Trump for President, Inc. (\"the Trump Campaign\"), and Roger Stone, who was employed by the Trump Campaign until November 9, 2015, and allegedly continued thereafter to advise the Trump Campaign informally. Plaintiffs assert that defendants engaged in a conspiracy with unidentified Russian agents and WikiLeaks to publish hacked emails. They bring two tort claims under D.C. law, one alleging a conspiracy to violate plaintiffs' privacy rights by publicly disclosing private facts and the other alleging a conspiracy to subject plaintiffs to intentional infliction of emotional distress. They also bring a federal claim under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201985\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1985\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3), alleging a conspiracy to violate plaintiffs' right to give support or advocacy to their chosen political candidate.

The Court will grant defendants' motions to dismiss, deny plaintiffs' motion, and dismiss plaintiffs' suit without prejudice.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Given this ruling, the Court does not address defendants' arguments that the complaint fails to allege sufficient facts to sustain a claim for tortious civil conspiracies or a conspiracy under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201985\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1985\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although the Court will explain the distinction between personal jurisdiction and the merits in detail below, it bears emphasizing that this Court's ruling is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   based on a finding that there was no collusion between defendants and Russia during the 2016 presidential election.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Some of those individuals were staff members of the DNC; some were donors; and some were other supporters, members of the media, or other private citizens.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-17\">\n    (Compl. \u00b6 7.) The Russian hackers allegedly had access to DNC accounts \"from July 2015 until at least mid-June 2016.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 86.) The voluminous material that the hackers obtained included thousands of Comer's emails; the social security numbers, dates of birth, home address, phone number, and banking relationships of Schoenberg and his wife; and the social security number, date of birth, address, and phone number of Cockrum. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 8.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-18\">\n    <strong>\n     C. Conspiracies with Russian Agents\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-19\">\n    Plaintiffs allege that Russian agents gained access to \"DNC networks, Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee ('DCCC') networks, and the personal email accounts of Democratic party officials and political figures\" (Compl. \u00b6 86), and did so \"as part of a deliberate campaign to interfere in the U.S. election and tilt its outcome in favor of Donald Trump.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 9;\n    <em>\n     see also id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 83-85.) Plaintiffs attribute the hack to Russian agents and do not allege that defendants were involved in the hack. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 86-87.) Importantly, plaintiffs' claims concern only the dissemination of emails hacked from the DNC and published by WikiLeaks on July 22, 2016. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 16, 42.) Plaintiffs do not seek to impose liability on defendants for the publication of emails from the DCCC or John Podesta, Chairman of Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign.\n    <footnotemark>\n     4\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-20\">\n    Plaintiffs allege, on information and belief, that Russia \"typically consults domestic political actors who act as Russia's partners to decide which extracted information to publish, how to time the release of the stolen information, and how to disseminate it in a way that would maximize the political impact.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 10.) As relevant to defendants, plaintiffs allege that\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n    [a]gents of the Trump Campaign, acting on behalf of the Campaign, met with-and were otherwise in contact with-Russian officials or their agents on numerous occasions during the spring and\n    summer of 2016. On at least one occasion, senior Trump Campaign officials met with a Kremlin-connected lawyer after being informed in an email that the meeting concerned information gathered as part of a Russian government effort to aid the Trump Campaign.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-22\">\n    (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 12;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 79.) This meeting took place on June 9, 2016, at Trump Tower in New York. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 98.) At this meeting,\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n    Mr. Trump Jr., Mr. Kushner, and Mr. Manafort met with a Kremlin-connected Russian lawyer who was described in emails as a \"Russian government attorney who is flying over from Moscow.\" According to reports, Mr. Trump Jr. agreed to attend this meeting after being promised damaging material about his father's opponent. The Trump Campaign participants in the meeting expected that the lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya, would produce such material. Mr. Trump Jr. attended the meeting after receiving an email indicating that the material was part of a Russian government effort to aid the Trump Campaign. That email (released on July 11, 2017 on Mr. Trump Jr.'s Twitter account) stated, \"This is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government's support for Mr. Trump.\" Rather than refuse to be part of an effort by Russia to interfere in the election through the release of Russian-obtained information, Mr. Trump Jr. expressed enthusiasm for the idea in a responsive email, in which he stated: \"If it's what you say I love it especially later in the summer.\" According to reports, the formatting of the email chain suggests that it was forwarded to Mr. Manafort and Mr. Kushner before the meeting, meaning that they went to the meeting fully aware that it was part of Russian efforts to interfere with the election. Mr. Trump Jr. acknowledged in a tweet issued on July 10, 2017 that he took the \"meeting to hear info about\" Mr. Trump's opponent. Rinat Akhmetshin, a Russian-American lobbyist with suspected ties to Russian intelligence and the Kremlin who has previously been accused of involvement with computer hacking schemes, also attended the June 9 meeting. According to his account of the meeting, Ms. Veselnitskaya produced documents that she claimed would show illegal payments to the DNC.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-24\">\n    (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 129.) By June 9, 2016, Russian agents already had access to the emails that concerned plaintiffs. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 130.) Although plaintiffs provide a detailed account about what happened at the June 9th meeting, there is no allegation that DNC emails were discussed. Besides the June 9th meeting at Trump Tower in New York, plaintiffs largely rely on conclusory allegations, based on information and belief, that defendants entered into an agreement with agents of Russia and WikiLeaks \"to have information stolen from the DNC publicly disseminated in a strategic way that would benefit the campaign to elect Mr. Trump as President\" (\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 13), and in return, defendants promised Russia that Mr. Trump would institute a more favorable policy toward Russia after assuming the presidency. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 14-15;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 138-59.) Plaintiffs also cite evidence of long-standing financial and personal relationships between agents of the Trump Campaign and Russia as background evidence to support an inference that there was a foundation on which both parties could build a conspiratorial relationship. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 102-118.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-25\">\n    <strong>\n     1. Meetings with Russian Agents in Spring and Summer 2016\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-26\">\n    Plaintiffs allege, on information and belief, that Russian agents met with the\n    Trump Campaign and its agents in Cleveland, D.C., New York, London, and Moscow to collaborate on publication of the hacked emails. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 88, 161.) Plaintiffs also allege, on information and belief, that the Trump Campaign exchanged at least 18 undisclosed phone calls and emails with Russian agents between April and November 2016. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 92;\n    <em>\n     see also id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 93-101, 129, 135-37.)\n    <footnotemark>\n     5\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-27\">\n    Plaintiffs ask the Court to infer that certain interactions could have been related to the alleged conspiracies when agents of the Trump Campaign met to discuss foreign policy towards Russia or communicated with a representative or agent of the Russian government, including the Russian Ambassador. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 139.) Most of the meetings that plaintiffs attempt to attribute to the conspiracies did not occur in the District, but allegedly took place in New York, at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, or abroad. As for D.C., plaintiffs allege, on information and belief, that \"agents and associates of the Campaign frequently conducted Campaign-related business in D.C., including at the Trump International Hotel in the District (even before it opened for business in September 2016) and on Capitol Hill.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 37.) On March 24, 2016, George Papadopoulos-then a member of President Trump's national security advisory committee-sent an email to \"several high-ranking Campaign officials\" about setting up a meeting between Russian leadership and President Trump. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 94.) A week later President Trump held a meeting with his national security advisory committee at the Trump International Hotel in Washington D.C. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 95.) Papadopoulos, Jeff Sessions, and J.D. Gordon, as well as other committee staff, attended. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ) The complaint does not allege what subjects were discussed at the meeting, but notes that \"Mr. Gordon later stated that, because of the views that Mr. Trump expressed at this meeting, during the Republican National Convention, he pushed for the adoption of language more favorable to Russia in the Republican Party platform.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    )\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-28\">\n    Almost a month later, on April 27, 2016, at the Mayflower Hotel in D.C., President Trump gave a foreign-policy speech that was favorable to Russia. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 96.) Russian Ambassador Kislyak attended the speech, and \"[o]n information and belief, Mr. Trump, Mr. Kushner, Mr. Sessions, and Mr. Kislyak held a private conversation during that event.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ) Even if such a conversation occurred, there is, however, no indication as to how it related to the conspiracies alleged in the complaint.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-29\">\n    Plaintiffs also allege that on July 7, 2016, Paul Manafort, while in Washington D.C., \"sent an email through an intermediary to Oleg Deripaska, a Russian billionaire with close ties to Mr. Putin, offering to brief him about the campaign. The email stated: 'If he needs private briefings we can accommodate.' \" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 99.) The complaint does not explain how, if at all, this email fits into the alleged conspiracies. But besides the two meetings discussed above, it is the only act alleged to have occurred in the District involving an agent of the Campaign that relates to the alleged conspiracies prior to the publication by WikiLeaks of the hacked DNC emails.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    <strong>\n     2. Publication of Hacked DNC Emails\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    On July 22, 2016, WikiLeaks published over 44,000 hacked emails, most of which\n    came from personnel on the DNC's finance team, including Comer. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 16, 42.) WikiLeaks did not redact information from the emails, which meant that a myriad of personal information about DNC employees and donors was published with the email dump. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 43, 45, 47-48.) As of the filing of the complaint, the emails were still publicly available on the Internet. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 44.) Plaintiffs allege, again on information and belief, that defendants \"and those they conspired with arranged for the hacked information to be provided to WikiLeaks\" and targeted the DNC finance team's emails for publication. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 16.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    <strong>\n     3. Events After the Email Publication\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    Plaintiffs do not specifically allege that Stone met with Russian agents or had communications with any co-conspirators until after the DNC emails were published on July 22, 2016, except to note that Stone admitted in an interview shortly after the email publication that \"he had communicated with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange but that he was 'not at liberty' to discuss aspects of those communications.\" (Compl. \u00b6 162.) As evidence that Stone was involved in the conspiracies, plaintiffs also cite Stone's public and private Twitter conversations, occurring shortly after the email publication, with \"hacker Guccifer 2.0\"-a person believed to be involved in the hack. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 163-64, 170-72.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    Plaintiffs also cite, as evidence to support an inference of conspiracy, instances after the July 22, 2016 publication when the Trump Campaign or Stone drew attention to the emails. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 167-81.) In addition, plaintiffs note that after July 22, 2016, agents of the Trump Campaign met with Russian agents to discuss foreign policy. For example, Michael Flynn had a phone conversation with Ambassador Kislyak on December 29, 2016, which allegedly \"took place while Mr. Flynn, Mr. Kislyak, or both were in Washington D.C.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 154.) Plaintiffs also claim that after the July 22, 2016 email dissemination, defendants have lied about or concealed their contacts with agents of the Russian government. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 24, 182-219.)\n    <footnotemark>\n     6\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    <strong>\n     D. Injury Resulting from Publication\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    According to the plaintiffs, the publication of the hacked DNC emails caused the following injuries:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n    First, it intimidated and deterred existing donors from further supporting the DNC's financial efforts. Second, it intimidated and deterred existing or potential donors from communicating with Mr. Comer or others at the DNC to support the Democratic Party's candidate for President. Third, it intimidated and deterred individuals, including Mr. Comer, from using email to advocate the election of their preferred candidate for the Presidency, for fear that their communications would be publicly disclosed.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    (Compl. \u00b6 16.) In addition, plaintiffs suffered other harm from the publication of personal information. (\n    <em>\n     See also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 61.) Specific to their \u00a7 1985(3) claim, plaintiffs allege that \"[t]he injuries suffered by all three Plaintiffs were the result of their having taken steps to advocate for and support candidates running for federal office.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 78.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    <strong>\n     1. Comer\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    WikiLeaks published \"thousands\" of Comer's emails. (Compl. \u00b6 19.) Comer complains about the dissemination of emails\n    relating to his sexuality, a medical condition, and gossip. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 19-20.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    Comer's hometown newspaper covered publication of the DNC emails, which led family members-including his grandparents-to search for and read emails about him. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 51.) Comer admits that he had disclosed his sexuality to friends, colleagues, and other family members, but he had not shared it with his grandparents before the email publication. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 69-70.)\n    <footnotemark>\n     7\n    </footnotemark>\n    The emails indicated that Comer served as the LGBT Finance Director for the DNC, and some emails contained interoffice gossip. At a hearing before this Court, plaintiffs argued that this interoffice gossip contained innuendo and suggestive language that could allow Comer's grandparents to deduce that he was gay. (Hr'g Tr., May, 17, 2018, ECF No. 70, (\"Tr.\") at 18-19.) As described generally in the complaint, Comer's\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n    emails ... included frank and private discussions about other individuals. Those emails sometimes reflected frustration or conflict-unsurprising in a tight-knit office under a great deal of stress-or the kind of offhand remarks or gossip that many of us make in private but are never intended for sharing with the entire world.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    (Compl. \u00b6 53.)\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n    These revelations strained relationships with coworkers, family, and friends, and ended some of Mr. Comer's relationships altogether. Publication of private statements about other individuals caused damage to his personal and professional reputation. Because his emails were disclosed, Mr. Comer received phone calls threatening violence, some calling him \"faggot.\" These circumstances led to severe emotional distress, anxiety, and depression. He found himself unable to sleep, haunted by nightmares, and unable to focus. He recognized the severity of the injury to his mental health and sought treatment, generating significant costs for medication and frequent visits with physicians and therapists.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n    In addition, Mr. Comer has felt intimidated regarding how he communicates with others in his advocacy for candidates for federal office out of a fear that his communications will be publicly disclosed.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 19-20.) One of the emails that were disclosed also contained information about Comer's health. \"A May 17, 2016 email from Mr. Comer to his boss, with whom he was close, describes his bodily functions during a virus, a topic that Mr. Comer, like most people, would never raise in public communications.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 52.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    Comer left the DNC in October 2016. (Tr. at 40.) Plaintiff attributes his decision to leave the DNC, the ending of a long-term romantic relationship, and damage to his professional reputation in the political finance industry to the publication of the emails.

On September 26, 2017, after defendants filed their first motions to dismiss, plaintiffs amended their complaint.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    Plaintiffs' current complaint contains three claims. The premise of these claims is that defendants conspired with Russian agents and WikiLeaks to publish the hacked emails, or aided and abetted Russian agents and WikiLeaks in publishing the hacked emails. Plaintiffs allege that defendants have committed two torts under D.C. law: (1) public disclosure of private facts, and (2) intentional infliction of emotional distress. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 223-39.) As for their federal claim, plaintiffs allege that defendants violated\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201985\">\n     42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1985\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (3) by conspiring to intimidate lawful voters from supporting or advocating for candidates for president and to injure citizens in person or property on account of such support or advocacy.

R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1), (2) lack of personal jurisdiction, Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(2), (3) improper venue, Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(3), and (4) failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted,\n    Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). Stone also filed a parallel motion to dismiss citing the same grounds and additionally arguing that plaintiffs lacked standing to bring their claims.\n    <footnotemark>\n     9\n    </footnotemark>\n    Plaintiffs filed their opposition on December 1, 2017, and defendants filed their replies on December 29, 2017.

However, on May 24, 2018, plaintiffs filed a motion for such discovery. Prior to this motion the only notice plaintiffs had given the Court that they might seek jurisdictional discovery came in a footnote in their opposition, which stated: \"Plaintiffs believe that the allegations in the Complaint are sufficient to establish that this Court may exercise personal jurisdiction over Defendants.

U.S. Const. Art. III. A plaintiff essentially defines the parameters of his case or controversy by virtue of his complaint.

Opp. at 21.) This argument fails for two related reasons.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-121\">\n    First, the harm to plaintiffs was not suffered in the forum. No plaintiff is domiciled in the District. Cockrum and Schoenberg suffered emotional injury related to disclosure of their social security numbers at home, outside of the District.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Masterson-Cook v.

Second, assuming personal jurisdiction over out-of-state defendants because plaintiffs' support and advocacy focused on national campaigns run by entities operating in the District would ignore\n    <em>\n     Walden\n    </em>\n    's requirement of defendant-centered contacts.\n    <footnotemark>\n     20\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-122\">\n    Comer presents a stronger argument for finding at least some harm in the forum. Like Cockrum and Schoenberg, Comer's emotional injuries are considered to have been suffered at home in Maryland. However, Comer worked for the DNC in the District. Comer thus claims that both his \u00a7 1985 injury and his tort-law injuries are connected to the reputational injury and emotional harm he suffered at his job. Even this is not enough.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Exponential Biotherapies, Inc. v.

(Tr. at 22.) But to the extent that plaintiffs have raised the possibility of relying on suit-related contacts by Stone in D.C., the Court can quickly dispense with such a suggestion. In the complaint it is alleged that Stone has suit-related contacts with D.C. because of his employment with the Trump Campaign.

Conspiratorial Theory of Personal Jurisdiction\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-129\">\n    Plaintiffs' remaining argument is based on a theory of conspiratorial jurisdiction, which uses the overt acts of co-conspirators in the forum as a basis for exercising specific jurisdiction over a defendant who otherwise has insufficient in-forum contacts.\n    <footnotemark>\n     24\n    </footnotemark>\n    Plaintiffs point to the fact that the emails disclosed by WikiLeaks on July 22, 2016, came from the hacking of DNC servers located in the District. (Pls.' Opp. at 20-21.) While plaintiffs acknowledge that they are not seeking to hold defendants directly liable for a conspiracy to hack into the DNC servers (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 21; Tr. at 7), they nevertheless argue that the hack should be considered because \"[c]o-conspirators can be liable for acts that took place before they joined the conspiracy\" for purposes of specific jurisdiction. (Pls. Opp. at 21.) Plaintiffs also suggest that defendants' co-conspirators may have taken other actions in the District that could subject defendants to conspiratorial personal jurisdiction.

Apparently, plaintiffs are content to rely on Stone and WikiLeaks, neither of whom committed any in-forum overt acts in furtherance of the conspiracies.

When confronted with similar \"national connection\" theories of personal jurisdiction in other contexts, courts in this Circuit have refused to allow personal jurisdiction over nonresidents whose only contacts with the District arise from its role as the epicenter of national politics.\n     <em>\n      See, e.g.\n     </em>\n     ,\n     <em>\n      Bigelow\n     </em>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524232\" index=\"200\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/299/34/#p41\">\n      299 F.Supp.3d at\n     </extracted-citation>\n     42-45 ;\n     <em>\n      see also\n     </em>\n     <em>\n      Atlantigas Corp.\n     </em>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9047661\" index=\"201\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/290/34/#p44\">\n      290 F.Supp.2d at 44\n     </extracted-citation>\n     .\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"21\">\n    <p id=\"p-201\">\n     Although plaintiffs do not cite\n     <em>\n      Calder v.
