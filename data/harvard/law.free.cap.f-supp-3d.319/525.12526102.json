(d/b/a Centerplate and Centerplate/NBSE) (\"Centerplate\") presently moves to dismiss Plaintiff's [1] Complaint under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6). Because the Court finds that Plaintiff lacks standing, and consequently that the Court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction, the Court need not reach the sufficiency of Plaintiff's claim. Upon consideration of the briefing,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   the relevant legal authorities, and the record as a whole, the Court shall\n   <strong>\n    GRANT\n   </strong>\n   Defendant Centerplate's Motion to Dismiss contained in its [9] Notice of Motion, and shall\n   <strong>\n    DISMISS\n   </strong>\n   this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The alleged facts in this case are few and readily stated. Plaintiff used a credit card to make a purchase from Defendant Centerplate and, in some fashion, ten Doe defendants. Compl., ECF No. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 16, 37. To memorialize the transaction, Defendants provided Plaintiff with one or more electronically printed receipts that contained the following pieces of information from Plaintiff's credit card: the full sixteen-digit card number, the expiration date, and the brand.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff brought a putative class action against Defendant Centerplate and the ten Doe defendants for allegedly violating the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 (\"FACTA\"). Compl., ECF No. 1, \u00b6 1. As amended by FACTA, Title 15 of the U.S. Code provides in pertinent part that \"no person that accepts credit cards or debit cards for the transaction of business shall print more than the last 5 digits of the card number or the expiration date upon any receipt provided to the cardholder at the point of the sale or transaction.\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681c(g)(1). The transaction\n   allegedly occurred after the effective date of this amendment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1681c(g)(3) (identifying effective date as either \"3 years after December 4, 2003,\" or \"1 year after December 4, 2003,\" depending on the machine used to print the receipt); Compl., ECF No. 1, \u00b6 37 (alleging transaction \"[a]fter December 3, 2006, and within two years from the date of filing of this action\" on September 1, 2017).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendant Centerplate seeks dismissal of this action under Rules 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Now that briefing has concluded, this motion is ripe for resolution. Because the Court shall resolve this case on the grounds of Plaintiff's inability to establish standing, the fact that the Doe defendants are presently unidentified has no bearing. But for ease of reference, the Court shall refer in the remainder of this Memorandum Opinion to the actions of Defendants as attributable only to Defendant Centerplate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Plaintiff evidently would rather \"simply crumple the receipt and throw it into a nearby trash can,\" but for the need to take this further precaution.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Whether understood separately or together, the increased risk and additional inconvenience are arguably one or more \"intangible harms,\" for which\n   <em>\n    Spokeo\n   </em>\n   urges a consideration of \"history and the judgment of Congress.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12596653\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1540/#p1547\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 1549\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Beginning with the history prong, the Court should consider \"whether an alleged intangible harm has a close relationship to a harm that has traditionally been regarded as providing a basis for a lawsuit in English or American courts.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12596653\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1540/#p1547\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff argues that privacy rights created by FACTA are analogous to common law torts for invasion of privacy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp'n at 10-12.

Even though several plaintiffs in that case made\n   <em>\n    no\n   </em>\n   allegation that the information was then used to steal their identities, the Third Circuit held that they had standing because of the \"unauthorized dissemination of their own private information-the very injury that FCRA is intended to prevent.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12129847\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/846/625/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12129847\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/846/625/\">\n    at 630, 640\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (footnote omitted). This is consistent with D.C. Circuit precedent. The\n   <em>\n    Owner-Operator\n   </em>\n   Court expressly interpreted\n   <em>\n    Horizon\n   </em>\n   in support of the D.C.

That\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   injury was readily observable in\n   <em>\n    Horizon\n   </em>\n   , much like\n   <em>\n    Attias\n   </em>\n   , where sensitive personal data had been obtained by a third party, substantially increasing the risk of identity theft.

Plaintiff makes no claim that anyone unauthorized has obtained or otherwise accessed her receipt, nor does she proffer any factual support for any particular risk that someone will do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   One further argument deserves attention. Plaintiff urges that the inclusion of statutory damages in Title 15 means that Congress contemplated that Plaintiff could recover under the present circumstances.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp'n at 13-14 (citing 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681n ). Congress does appear to provide for statutory damages even where actual damages are not proven:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   Any person who willfully fails to comply with any requirement imposed under this subchapter with respect to any consumer is\n   <em>\n    liable to that consumer\n   </em>\n   in an amount equal to the sum of--\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   (1)(A) any actual damages sustained by the consumer as a result of the failure\n   <em>\n    or damages of not less than $100 and not more than $1,000\n   </em>\n   ; or ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   (2) such amount of punitive damages as the court may allow; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   (3) in the case of any successful action to enforce any liability under this section, the costs of the action together with reasonable attorney's fees as determined by the court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681n(a) (emphasis added). But Plaintiff cannot escape her obligation to establish standing under Article III simply by pointing to the potential availability of relief on the merits. The Court has found under\n   <em>\n    Attias\n   </em>\n   that Plaintiff has not alleged a sufficiently imminent risk of harm such that she experienced a concrete injury in fact. Rather, in light of\n   <em>\n    Owner-Operator\n   </em>\n   , she has merely speculated as to a potential future injury. Only if Plaintiff had experienced a concrete injury in fact,\n   even without any actual damage, could the Court proceed to consider Plaintiff's entitlement to statutory damages. \"In a future case, the plaintiff may be able to show that a violation of the FACTA (or another provision of the FCRA) has caused [her] concrete harm,\" in which instance she \"may still seek statutory damages if the actual damages are small or difficult to ascertain.\"\n   <em>\n    Meyers v.

The Court relatedly denies Plaintiff's request for leave to amend the complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp'n at 22-23. Plaintiff makes that proposal in the context of responding to Defendant's objection that she had not included a copy of the receipt with her Complaint, nor had she otherwise offered many details about the transaction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mem. at 7; Pl.'s Opp'n at 22-23; Def.'s Reply at 11-12.

Accordingly, the Court shall\n   <strong>\n    GRANT\n   </strong>\n   Defendant's Motion to Dismiss contained in its [9] Notice of Motion and shall\n   <strong>\n    DISMISS\n   </strong>\n   this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   An appropriate Order accompanies this Memorandum Opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    The Court's consideration has focused on the following pleadings:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n    \u2022 Def.'s Mem. in Supp. of Mot. to Dismiss, ECF No. 9-1 (\"Def.'s Mem.\");\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n    \u2022 Pl.'s Mem. in Opp'n to Def.'s Mot. to Dismiss, ECF No. 14 (\"Pl.'s Opp'n\"); and\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n    \u2022 Def.'s Reply in Supp. of Mot. to Dismiss, ECF No. 15 (\"Def.'s Reply\").\n   </blockquote>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    While the Complaint hedges by stating that \"one or more\" receipts were involved, Plaintiff's Opposition attaches two, which appear to derive from the same transaction. Compl., ECF No. 1, \u00b6 37; Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. 1, ECF No. 14-1. For ease of discussion and consistency with the Complaint, the Court shall refer to a singular \"receipt.\" However, the number of receipts is immaterial. The Court need not rely on this evidence outside of the Complaint in order to dispose of the pending motion.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    The receipt attached to Plaintiff's Opposition identifies the date of the transaction as September 5, 2015. Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. 1, ECF No. 14-1, at 5. The Court refers to the ECF page numbering of this document in the absence of other pagination. Again, however, the Court need not rely on this evidence external to the Complaint in light of allegations in the latter.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    A look at the receipt attached to Plaintiff's Opposition confirms that it lacks Plaintiff's name. Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. 1, ECF No. 14-1, at 5.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    The two drivers whose information\n    <em>\n     was\n    </em>\n    released to prospective employers were found to have suffered concrete harm for standing purposes.\n    <em>\n     Owner-Operator\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264324\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/879/339/#p340\">\n     879 F.3d at 345\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
