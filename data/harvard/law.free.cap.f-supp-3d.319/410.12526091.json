INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Competitive Enterprise Institute (\"Competitive Enterprise\") brings this action against the Department of Treasury pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act (\"FOIA\") concerning its request for a two-page letter (the \"Letter\") exchanged between the Governor of the Bank of England and former Treasury Secretary Jack Lew. Neither party contests that the Letter contains potentially sensitive information regarding the economic policies of the United States government. They do dispute, however, whether FOIA requires the disclosure of that information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Department of Treasury declined to disclose the Letter under FOIA Exemption 1, which exempts from disclosure information classified in the interest of national defense or foreign policy. Competitive Enterprise argues that the Letter does not fall within the scope of Exemption 1 because it was improperly classified. It also requests that the Court conduct an\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review of the Letter, asserting that the declaration provided by the Department of Treasury is not specific enough for the Court to reach a determination on the Letter's status, and that the Department's handling of the classification process and FOIA requests indicate agency bad faith or sloppiness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   For the reasons explained below, the Court finds that the Letter was properly classified and that the Department of Treasury's Exemption 1 withholding is justified. Accordingly, the Court grants the Department of Treasury's motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In September 2014, the Governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, sent the Letter to then-Secretary of the Treasury Jack Lew. Def.'s Statement of Material Facts (\"Def.'s Statement\") \u00b6 1, ECF No. 12. To date, the contents of the Letter have not been made public or disclosed by the Department of Treasury, but Competitive Enterprise contends that the Letter inquired why the reinsurance subsidiary of a large and influential American company, Berkshire Hathaway, was not included in the United States Financial Stability Board's list of \"systemically important financial institutions.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 1, ECF No. 1. After the Letter was sent, the Bank of England requested that the Letter be given confidential treatment. Def.'s Statement \u00b6 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In April 2015, a series of online reports were published regarding Berkshire Hathaway's alleged absence from the Financial Stability Board's list.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mem. Opp'n Def.'s Mot. Summ. J. (\"Pl.'s Opp'n\") at 7, ECF No. 14; Pl.'s Opp'n. Attach. A. ECF No. 14-4. Later that month, Elizabeth Festa, who is not a party to this action, submitted a FOIA request for the Letter.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   Attach. B., ECF No. 14-5. The Department of Treasury denied Ms. Festa's request, claiming that the Letter was a \"foreign record\" not releasable by the agency.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Attach. C., ECF No. 14-6. Two years later, in April 2017, the Department\n   of Treasury decided to classify the Letter pursuant to \u00a7 1.4(b), (d), and (e) of Executive Order 13,526, on the grounds that the Letter contained \"foreign government information,\" information damaging to the \"foreign relations or foreign activities of the United States,\" and information concerning \"scientific, technological, or economic matters relating to the national security.\" Def.'s Statement \u00b6\u00b6 5-8; Decl. Michael Mason (\"Mason Decl.\") \u00b6 8, ECF No. 12-1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   That month, Competitive Enterprise submitted its own FOIA request for the Letter. Pl.'s Opp'n at 1. The Department of Treasury informed Competitive Enterprise that the requested Letter had been properly classified \"in accordance with Executive Order 13,526,\" and it accordingly denied the request under FOIA Exemption 1, which protects against the disclosure of classified information.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Attach.

In June 2017, the Department of Treasury similarly informed Ms. Festa of the Letter's classification, noting that though the Letter was not a \"foreign record,\" as it had previously been characterized, it nonetheless remained protected from disclosure.

ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Department of Treasury maintains that the Letter may be withheld under Exemption 1 because the information in the Letter was properly classified in accordance with the procedural and substantive requirements of Executive Order No. 13,526, and the information in the letter pertains to (1) foreign government information; (2) foreign relations or foreign activities of the United States; and (3) scientific, technological, or economic matters relating to the national security.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Exec.

(\"Def.'s Mot.\") at 6, ECF No. 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Competitive Enterprise attacks the Letter's classification on several grounds. First, Competitive Enterprise asserts that the Department of Treasury improperly classified the Letter to avoid the embarrassment of public disclosure. Pl.'s Opp'n at 5-6. Second, Competitive Enterprise argues that the Letter does not fall within the categories of information that may be classified under EO 13,526 \u00a7 1.4. Pl.'s Opp'n at 2-3. Third, Competitive Enterprise argues that even if the Letter's content warranted classification, the Department of Treasury failed to follow the classification procedure established by the Department of State's Foreign Affairs Manual. Pl.'s Opp'n at 5-7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   For the reasons explained below, the Court holds that because it is plausible that the Letter contains information, the disclosure of which could harm \"foreign relations,\" it was properly classified pursuant to EO 13,526 \u00a7 1.4(d). The Court additionally concludes that given the deference afforded to agencies in matters of national security,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Campbell v.

Competitive Enterprise makes several arguments for why the Letter's classification does not comply with EO 13,526, none of which persuade the Court. The Department of Treasury's declaration adequately indicates that the Letter \"pertains to ... foreign relations or foreign activities of the United States,\" and therefore was properly classified.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   EO 13,526 \u00a7 1.4(d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   As noted above, FOIA requires agencies to disclose records upon request unless one of nine exemptions applies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Milner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12457268,5989278\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/562/562/\">\n    562 U.S. at 565\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12457268,5989278\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/562/562/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 1259\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Department of Treasury's motion for summary judgment (ECF No. 12) is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   .

That argument lacks merit for two reasons. First, because the Letter falls within \u00a7 1.4(d) of EO 13,526, pertaining to \"foreign relations,\" it does not and need not necessarily contain \"information received from a foreign government,\" and therefore the Manual need not apply. Second, even if the Letter does contain \"foreign government information,\" the Foreign Affairs Manual applies solely to the classification procedures of \"foreign affairs agencies,\" which the Department of Treasury is not.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    12 FAM 511.1(a)(1)-(5) (listing \"foreign affairs agencies\").\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    Competitive Enterprise additionally argues that Mr. Mason's use of statutory language in his declaration necessitates\n    <em>\n     in camera\n    </em>\n    review.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pl.'s Opp'n at 16 (citing\n    <em>\n     Campbell\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1381288,3668203\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/164/20/\">\n     164 F.3d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    30 ).

Given the Court's determination that the language of the declaration is sufficiently specific, Mr. Mason's use of certain \"verbatim\" passages from EO 13,526 is not, as Competitive Enterprise contends, dispositive.

While the Court takes notice of the timeline surrounding Ms. Festa's request, the fact that the agency later determined that the information in the Letter was classifiable, and not a \"foreign record,\" is not tangible evidence of bad faith, nor does it display the extreme sloppiness Competitive Enterprise claims-particularly given the Court's determination that the information in the Letter was indeed classifiable.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Attach.

Moreover, considering that the Letter is only two pages long, even if it were not classified in its entirety, any segregable information that may have remained after the redaction of the exempted portions would likely be so \"inextricably intertwined\" with classified information as to render any segregability futile.\n    <em>\n     James Madison Project v.
