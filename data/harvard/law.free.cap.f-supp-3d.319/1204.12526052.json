Koppe's Report and Recommendation (\"R &amp; R\" or \"Recommendation\") (ECF No. 20), recommending that this case be remanded for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Defendants had until June 7, 2018, to file an objection. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20.) To date, no objection to the R &amp; R has been filed. Accordingly, the Court adopts the R &amp; R with respect to remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   1 This Court \"may accept, reject, or modify, in whole or in part, the findings or recommendations made by the magistrate judge.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1).

Thus, if there is no objection to a magistrate judge's recommendation, then the court may accept the recommendation without review.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Johnstone\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9118820\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/263/1219/#p1226\">\n    263 F.Supp.2d at 1226\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (accepting, without review, a magistrate judge's recommendation to which no objection was filed).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   As noted, Defendants did not object to the R &amp; R. Nevertheless, this Court finds it appropriate to engage in a\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review in order to determine whether to adopt the R &amp; R. The Magistrate Judge recommends that this Court reject Defendant Insys Therapeutics, Inc.'s fraudulent misjoinder argument. Upon review of the R &amp; R and filings in this case, the Court agrees with the R &amp; R and will adopt the recommendation to remand for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   It is hereby ordered that the Magistrate Judge's Report and Recommendation (ECF No. 20) is accepted and adopted.

The undersigned also\n   <strong>\n    RECOMMENDS\n   </strong>\n   that Defendant Insys' recently-filed motion to dismiss (Docket No. 17) and motion to sever (Docket No. 18) be\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   without prejudice to seeking relief in state court following remand.

BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiff is the executor of the estate of Diana Hampton, who died following an overdose of the drug Fentanyl. Compl. \u00b6 22 (Docket No. 1-1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff filed a complaint in state court alleging that Defendant Steven Holper had been improperly providing Fentanyl to Ms. Hampton without a prescription and without a medically appropriate purpose.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 17-20. Plaintiff alleges that Ms. Hampton would use a tool to open the Fentanyl canisters to access the drug and would then use a syringe to inject the Fentanyl into her arm.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 21. Plaintiff alleges that, in improperly providing Fentanyl to Ms. Hampton, Defendant Holper is liable for wrongful death for negligently breaching his duty to provide proper medical treatment to Ms. Hampton.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 28-41. Plaintiff also alleges a wrongful death claim against Defendant Holper for intentional and reckless conduct.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 42-47.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Nine days after Plaintiff filed that complaint in state court, he filed an amended complaint that also names Insys as a defendant. Am. Compl. \u00b6 3 (Docket No. 1-2). Plaintiff alleges that Insys is the manufacturer, marketer, and distributor of Fentanyl.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff brings all of the above claims for wrongful death against both Defendant Holper and Defendant Insys.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 29-48 (asserting causes of action against \"all defendants\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff also brings three additional claims against Defendant Insys; causes of action for negligence, product liability design defect, and failure to warn.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 49-71. With respect to the first of those causes of action, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant Insys was negligent in continuing to supply Fentanyl to Defendant Holper despite his history of medical malpractice, his history of overprescribing pain medications, and his highly suspicious orders.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 51, 53, 58. Plaintiff also alleges that Defendant Insys misrepresented its compliance with its\n   duties under the law, and concealed that non-compliance and shipment of suspicious orders of Fentanyl to Defendant Holper.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 55.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Plaintiff served Defendant Insys with the amended complaint on March 15, 2018. Docket No. 1-4. On April 16, 2018, Defendant Insys removed this case from state court on the basis of diversity jurisdiction. Docket No. 1.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The notice of removal essentially acknowledges that both Plaintiff and Defendant Holper are Nevada citizens for diversity purposes,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   but asserts that Defendant Insys' Arizona citizenship suffices to establish this Court's subject matter jurisdiction through application of the fraudulent misjoinder doctrine and/or through severance of the claims against Defendant Holper.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   On April 17, 2018, the undersigned issued an order for Defendant Insys to show cause why this case should not be remanded for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.

MAGISTRATE JUDGE AUTHORITY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Before turning to the substance of the pending order to show cause, the Court first evaluates its authority to address the matter. The authority of the undersigned magistrate judge is derived from\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which generally provides magistrate judges with the authority to \"hear and determine\" non-dispositive matters.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(A) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    S.E.C. v.

By contrast, dispositive matters are sometimes referred to magistrate judges, but in those circumstances a magistrate judge submits a recommendation to the assigned district judge that is subject to the district judge's\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(B) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    CMKM Diamonds\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3701065\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/729/1248/#p1259\">\n    729 F.3d at 1259-60\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Section 636 specifically enumerates eight different types of matters to be treated as \"dispositive.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(A)-(B). When a matter falls outside of those expressly enumerated as dispositive, courts look to the nature and effect of the issued ruling to determine whether the underlying matter should be considered dispositive or non-dispositive.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Maisonville v.

FRAUDULENT MISJOINDER\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The primary thrust of Defendant Insys' position on the appropriateness of removal is that the Court may exercise diversity jurisdiction over this case despite the lack of complete diversity based on the fraudulent misjoinder doctrine. Docket No. 13 at 2-8.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The undersigned is not persuaded by this argument as the fraudulent misjoinder doctrine is not valid in the Ninth Circuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   It is well-established in the Ninth Circuit that a plaintiff may not defeat diversity jurisdiction by fraudulently joining a non-diverse party against whom no viable claim can be pled.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ritchey v. Upjohn Drug Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11851261\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/139/1313/#p1318\">\n    139 F.3d 1313\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1318 (9th Cir. 1998). A \"fraudulent joinder\" occurs when the \"plaintiff fails to state a cause of action against [a] defendant, and the failure is obvious according to the settled rules of the state.\"\n   <em>\n    McCabe v.

Defendant Insys does not argue in this case that Plaintiff has failed to state a claim against Defendant Holper, so the fraudulent joinder doctrine is inapplicable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Defendant Insys instead relies on the novel doctrine of \"fraudulent misjoinder.\" The fraudulent misjoinder doctrine was created by the Eleventh Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Tapscott v.

In that case, the Eleventh Circuit found that the fraudulent misjoinder doctrine applies where a diverse defendant is joined with a non-diverse defendant as to whom there is no joint, several or alternative liability and where the claim against the diverse defendant has no real connection to the claim against the non-diverse defendant.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11477258\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/204/1069/#p1072\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Eleventh Circuit further found in that case that the claims against the defendants at issue had \"no real connection\" to one another and that their joinder was \"so egregious\" that the non-diverse defendant\n   could be ignored to establish diversity jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11477258\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/204/1069/#p1072\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \"[T]he Eleventh Circuit is the only federal appellate court to adopt fraudulent misjoinder.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Prempro Prods.
