BOASBERG, United States District Judge\n   Emily Dickinson once said of dogs, \"They are better than [human] beings because they know but do not tell.\" Unfortunately for Plaintiff Mark Thorp, the only neutral witness in this case is his Doberman pinscher named Vaughn. According to Defendants, two officers with the Metropolitan Police Department observed Thorp beat his dog, necessitating a rescue mission inside his home. Plaintiff vigorously disputes such accusation, alleging that the officers fabricated all evidence of animal cruelty, executed not one but two faulty warrants of his home, arrested him without probable cause, illegally seized cash and other property, and, to add salt to the wound, needlessly impounded the Doberman. Seeking relief for such grievances, he filed this civil suit against the District of Columbia and Lieutenant Ramey Kyle, the commander who executed the search warrants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   So long as Vaughn stays silent, the Court may never know precisely what unfolded that day. As it turns out, however, these factual disputes matter not for purposes of this action. Even construing the facts in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, the Court finds that summary judgment in favor of Defendants is appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Court has previously detailed the background behind Plaintiff's suit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thorp v. Dist. of Columbia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4227894\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/142/132/#p135\">\n    142 F.Supp.3d 132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 135-136 (D.D.C. 2015). It therefore limits the discussion here to the contested searches and seizures of February 4, 2015. As Defendants ultimately prevail, the Court recounts these facts in the light most favorable to Plaintiff. This is no easy task, however, as Thorp does not attach copies of the depositions to which he cites. The Court will therefore rely, when available, on the excerpts of those depositions provided by Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On February 4, two officers in the MPD's Vice Unit-Fredrick Onoja and William Rapp-were stationed in a church parking lot near Thorp's home at 1029 16th Street N.E.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. MSJ, Exh. 3 (Deposition of William Rapp) at 32:1-7; Exh. 4 (Deposition of Fredrick Onoja) at 43:12-21. At approximately 7:35 a.m., the officers purportedly saw and heard Plaintiff \"forcefully strike\" his dog, a 17-month Doberman pinscher.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Def. MSJ, Exh. 1 (First Search Warrant Aff.) at 1; Onoja Dep. at 43:6-11 (\"Q: You saw Mr. Thorpe [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] hit his dog that morning? A: Yes.\"); Rapp Dep. at 60:3-9, 62:22 (\"I saw Mr. Thorp hit the dog.\"),\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 101-1 (Pl. Response to Def. SMF), \u00b6 2 (questioning whether officers were in position to observe such behavior). Thorp then took the dog inside the house and did not return,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 4, denying Officers Onoja's and Rapp's requests to speak with him.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 5, 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Those officers then reported-falsely, according to Thorp-the incident to Washington Humane Society Law Enforcement Officer Ann Russell, who in turn applied to the D.C. Superior Court for a search warrant of Plaintiff's home.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   First Search Warrant Aff. at 2;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , Exh. 10 (Deposition of Ann Russell) at 37:10-22, 39:11-14, 40:2-12, 63:14-19. Judge Ramsey Johnson approved the application, authorizing a search for \"[a]nimals physically abused (dead or alive, born or unborn, above ground or below)[,] bowls, water bowls, or any other evidence of animal cruelty/neglect\" that evidenced \"commission of a crime in violation of Title 22, Section 1001, D.C. [Code].\" First Search Warrant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At that point, Lieutenant Kyle-the sole officer sued in his individual capacity-entered the picture. According to Thorp, Kyle previously \"had a sexual relationship with [ ] Plaintiff's ex-girlfriend.\" ECF No. 94-1 (Pl. SMF), \u00b6 37. He also, coincidentally or not, commanded a team of thirteen officers executing the search warrant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 93 (Pl. MSJ) at 7, 11 (citing Russell Dep. at 41-42). The unit arrived at roughly 3:00 p.m., and within ten minutes, the humane officers had secured the dog.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Exh. PP (photograph). Both Russell and fellow Humane Law Enforcement Officer Daniel D'Eramo observed the dog was uninjured and in good health,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Russell Dep. at 83:1-6; Def. MSJ, Exh. 11 (Deposition of Daniel D'Eramo) at 102:15-16; 114:6-11, and neither discovered additional evidence of animal cruelty.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Russell Dep. at 100:7-15; D'Eramo Dep. at 139:3-4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Nevertheless, the search persisted. Plaintiff alleges that Kyle's true motive was to uncover illegal drugs in the home, as the \"local neighborhood boss\"-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , Kathy Henderson, an Advisory Neighborhood Commissioner-had apparently long targeted him as a suspected drug dealer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. SMF, \u00b6 43; Pl. Reply at 40. Whether spurred by political pressure from Henderson or, perhaps, personal animosity, Thorp believes \"Kyle knew exactly what he wanted to find when he smashed down the doors of the Plaintiff's home and it had nothing to do with spurious allegations of animal cruelty.\" Pl. MSJ at 43. In that vein, Kyle continued searching \"closed containers,\" including the freezer, well after the dog was safely outside.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. SMF, \u00b6 67;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Def. MSJ, Exh. 5 (Deposition of Andrew Gamm) at 124:5-11 (noting that Kyle opened the closed freezer door). Inside the freezer, the Lieutenant found two unmarked zip-top bags full of capsules, which he says he immediately recognized as illicit substances.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. MSJ, Exh. 12 (Deposition of Ramey Kyle) at 115-18. In a subsequent field test, the pills reacted positively for amphetamines.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Exh. 2 (Second Search Warrant Aff.) at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Thorp insists that he had a prescription for the pharmaceuticals and that Kyle \"was present in ... [a] room where the prescription bottles were in plain view.\" Pl. SMF, \u00b6 77 (citing Kyle Dep. at 126-127). The officer nonetheless called MPD Sergeant Paul Hong to report his discovery, never mentioning said prescriptions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Kyle Dep. at 118:16-120:5; Second Search Warrant Aff. at 2. Another officer within the unit then applied for a second search warrant for Thorp's home, this one for drugs and related materials, including suspected \"cash proceeds\" concealed there in \"[v]iolation of D.C. code 48-904.01,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , which prohibits \"knowingly or intentionally ... possess[ing], with intent to ... distribute, a controlled substance.\" D.C. Superior Court Judge Geoffrey Alprin approved the warrant.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   After this second search-which Thorp deems a \"raid\"-officers found approximately 4.1 grams of crystalized substances; a total of 100 capsules; a green box containing one-inch zip-top bags, each bearing numerous Batman logos; and drug paraphernalia.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. MSJ, Exh. 22 (Afari Crime Scene Report) at 2-6; Exh. 18 (Gamm Crime Scene Report) at 5-7; Exh. 23 (Arrest Record) at 2; Exh. 24 (Property Seizure Report: Drugs); Exh. 20 (Deposition of Jacqueline Gerrish) at 73:17-75:1 (noting MDMA-commonly known as ecstasy-is \"sold on the street\" in \"ziplocks with Batman logos on them.\"). Thorp was then arrested, allegedly at Kyle's behest,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pl. RSMF, \u00b6 32, and charged with animal cruelty and possession of illegal drugs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Thorp\n   </em>\n   , No. 2015-CF2-001682. Officers also seized $53,426 in cash from the premises, and\n   Russell impounded Plaintiff's Doberman.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. RSMF, \u00b6\u00b6 31, 33. Although a laboratory test later showed the pills seized were methylenedioxy-methamphetamine (MDMA) and etholyne,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Def. MSJ, Exh. 21 (Drug Test Results), \"the United States Attorney abandoned the criminal case against\" Thorp.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. SMF, \u00b6 114. On May 22, 2015, the D.C. Superior Court dismissed all criminal charges against him related to the February 4 search of his home.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Seeking redress for these injuries, Plaintiff brought this suit against the District and Kyle.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thorp\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4227894\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/142/132/#p135\">\n    142 F.Supp.3d at 136-37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . He filed his First Amended Complaint on February 15, 2015,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 12, and added a Second Amended Complaint on July 13, 2015.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 22.

After Defendants subsequently moved to dismiss,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. 23, 24, 26, the Court winnowed the claims to the following: Counts II and III against Kyle only, for limited Fourth Amendment violations; Count IV against the District only, under the D.C. common law of negligent supervision and retention; and Counts VIII and IX, consolidated into a single abuse-of-process claim, against Kyle on a direct-liability theory and against the District on a vicarious-liability theory.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thorp\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4227894\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/142/132/#p135\">\n    142 F.Supp.3d at 149\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   After nearly 19 months of discovery, both parties have filed Cross-Motions for Summary Judgment.

The District argues that the humane officers would have impounded the dog regardless of the charges,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Def.

After all, they knew Thorp was the sole owner of the Doberman and were loath to leave the dog abandoned in his absence. But to the extent that the humane officers kept the Doberman\n    <em>\n     after\n    </em>\n    his release, Thorp finds more traction. It is unclear exactly when Plaintiff left custody,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    ECF No. 93-1 (Declaration of Mark Thorp), \u00b6 26 (alleging that he was subject to \"regular appearances before pre-trial authorities\" for three months). Assuming he was released within 14 days, the Humane Society would have had little reason to keep the Doberman but for the animal-cruelty charges.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    Plaintiff attributes these charges to Kyle, alleging that he told the humane officers that \"Mr. Thorp was being arrested for animal cruelty.\" Pl. MSJ at 25 (citing Russell Dep. at 99-100). Regardless of whether Kyle actually had probable cause to press such charges, however, qualified immunity spares him once more. To refresh, Kyle believed-as Officers Rapp and Onoja reported-that Thorp had \"forcefully struck\" his dog. At that point, Kyle also knew that a neutral magistrate had found probable cause to search the home. While the search did not unearth any new evidence of animal cruelty, a reasonable officer could assume that there were still sufficient grounds for arrest. Even were that assumption faulty, it was not so \"plainly incompetent\" as to trigger civil liability.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Malley\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6202676\" index=\"179\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/475/335/#p344\">\n     475 U.S. at 341\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6202676\" index=\"180\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/475/335/#p344\">\n     106 S.Ct. 1092\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    <em>\n     7.

Neither action, however, could properly form the basis of an abuse-of-process claim. The D.C. Circuit has noted expressly that \"warrantless arrests and detentions effectuated entirely\n    <em>\n     independent\n    </em>\n    of the judicial process could not support an abuse of process tort claim.\"\n    <em>\n     McCarthy\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"618546,3802170\" index=\"209\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/741/1406/\">\n     741 F.2d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    1414 &amp; n.9 (declining to certify class when unclear whether all putative members were \"victimized by abuses of the judicial process\"). The same is true for property seized without proper authority. After all, \"the tort evolved as a 'catch-all' category to cover improper uses of the\n    <em>\n     judicial\n    </em>\n    machinery.\"\n    <em>\n     Barquis v.

While Kyle's warrantless actions may fall under another tort (say, false arrest), they cannot sustain an abuse-of-process claim.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-91\">\n    In his briefing, Thorp shifts gears, criticizing Kyle for \"pursuing these bizarrely unsupportable animal cruelty claims in an overblown dynamic entry search warrant.\" Pl. Reply at 39. While an application for a warrant can qualify as abuse of process, Thorp has barked up the wrong tree by bringing such count against Kyle. As explained earlier, the evidence indicates only that Officers Onoja and Rapp may have fabricated the animal-cruelty allegations; any theory of direct liability against Kyle on that basis must therefore fail.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    So, too, for his theory of vicarious liability. His Complaint sought only to hold the District responsible for\n    <em>\n     Kyle\n    </em>\n    's actions, so the city's liability rises and falls with that of its Lieutenant. In any event, even were the Court to hold the District responsible for its other officers, the Complaint is silent as to Onoja's and Rapp's\n    motivation. At most, those officers may have suspected Plaintiff of dealing drugs. For an abuse-of-process claim to prevail, however, plaintiff must show, \"in addition to ulterior motive, ... a 'perversion of the judicial process and achievement of some end not contemplated in the regular prosecution of the charge.' \"\n    <em>\n     Scott\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3697749,7638262\" index=\"213\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/101/748/\">\n     101 F.3d at 756\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (quoting\n    <em>\n     Morowitz v.

There is thus no cause of action when \"officers institute[ ] [a] criminal [proceeding] for precisely the purpose for which it was intended: establishing that [the plaintiff] was guilty of a criminal offense.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7942173\" index=\"215\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/423/196/#p198\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    Whether Onoja and Rapp thought Thorp guilty of animal cruelty or of drug dealing, their application for a search warrant thus did not abuse process.

Conclusion\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    For the foregoing reasons, the Court will grant Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment and deny Plaintiff's Cross-Motion for Partial Summary Judgment.
