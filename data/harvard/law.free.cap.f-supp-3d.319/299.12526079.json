Heyer and Schwartz, both lawyers, left a national law firm in spring 2012 to start their own two-person law firm called Schwartz &amp; Associates. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 8-11, Dkt. 1. They did not create an operating agreement, but tax forms indicate that at the start, Heyer held a 20 percent equity interest and Schwartz held an 80 percent interest.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12. Heyer and Schwartz had been working largely for one particular client at their old firm, and they created the new firm primarily to serve this client with their own billing arrangement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Schwartz, on behalf of Schwartz &amp; Associates, signed a written agreement with the principal client that required the client to pay Schwartz &amp; Associates a fixed fee each month.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 15-16. Schwartz and the client also agreed orally that the client would pay a 25 percent contingency fee on any recovery resulting from Schwartz &amp; Associates' representation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Heyer and Schwartz agreed orally that Heyer would be entitled to a fixed monthly distribution along with a portion of any contingent fee recoveries received from the client.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In spring 2013, Schwartz &amp; Associates successfully negotiated a settlement that allowed the client to recover $2.1 million.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 17-18. But the client failed to promptly pay the 25 percent contingency fee-$525,000-and Schwartz failed to press the client for payment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19. In late summer 2013, Heyer and Schwartz agreed to increase Heyer's equity share to 30 percent and that Heyer would receive 30 percent of future contingency fees from the client.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21. Heyer and Schwartz also agreed that Heyer would receive $150,000 of the $525,000 already earned.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Unbeknownst to Heyer, however, Schwartz had struck a deal with the client that significantly reduced the $525,000 amount.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26. Another law firm had assisted Schwartz &amp; Associates on one of the client's cases, and under the deal, the law firm was paid from the $525,000.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Heyer learned about the deal several months later from the client.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27. Schwartz initially denied that he had made such deal, but in early January 2014 he notified Heyer that he had accepted an amount of $305,484.29 instead of $525,000 from the client.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 29, 33. Heyer ultimately received 30 percent of the $305,484.29 amount, which at $91,645.29 was $58,354.71 less than the $150,000 he was promised.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Also in early January, the client indicated that it might end the litigation for which it had retained Schwartz &amp; Associates, cutting off Schwartz &amp; Associates' primary source of revenue.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31. The client assured Heyer, however, that it would continue to pay the funds necessary for Heyer to take his fixed monthly distribution for the next three months.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35. Schwartz, in turn, promised Heyer that he would receive that monthly distribution through May 2014.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Meanwhile, Schwartz &amp; Associates helped the client settle three additional cases in January and February, and Schwartz promised Heyer that he would ensure that they would receive the 25 percent contingency fees from the client.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39. Heyer continued to work for Schwartz &amp; Associates, assuming that he would continue to receive his fixed monthly distribution and his portion of the contingency fees.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On February 19, however, the client told Heyer that beginning in March it would no longer pay the funds corresponding to his fixed monthly distribution.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Schwartz then decided to withhold Heyer's fixed monthly distribution for February.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42. Heyer left Schwartz &amp; Associates and resumed work at the national law firm in mid-March.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43. After Heyer left, the client settled two additional cases that Schwartz &amp; Associates had worked on.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 44. Schwartz, however, never pressed the client to pay the contingency fees-for these two cases or the three that had settled earlier.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 40, 44.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   As Heyer prepared to sue the client for the promised fixed monthly distribution and contingency fees that summer, Schwartz and the client entered into a release agreement covering all potential claims of Schwartz &amp; Associates principals,\n   agents, and authorized representatives.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 46. In exchange, the client's majority owner-who also owned an entity that acted as Schwartz &amp; Associates' landlord-gave Schwartz &amp; Associates free rent for ten months.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48. Heyer's claims were ultimately heard by an arbitration board, which awarded Heyer an amount corresponding to his fixed monthly distribution for the first half of March 2014 during which he was unemployed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 47.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Heyer brought this suit in April 2016, the defendants moved to dismiss in September 2016, and the case was reassigned to the undersigned judge in December 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Defs.' Br. at 9-11, 15-16. That precludes the claims, the defendants continue, because Heyer did not follow the requirements for derivative claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 23.1 (establishing a procedural roadmap for shareholders wishing to bring a derivative claim). The defendants premise the derivative-claims argument on the contention that \"any recovery for the alleged breach[es] would flow through [Schwartz &amp; Associates] before it reached Heyer.\" Defs.' Br. at 9. That is, because Heyer's injuries are based on fees unpaid by the client to Schwartz &amp; Associates-fees that if paid would have been apportioned to Heyer-any injury to Heyer derives purely from injury to Schwartz &amp; Associates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The defendants' argument is too clever by half. The complaint alleges that after the parties and client agreed on a particular fee structure in which Heyer would receive a particular portion of the fees, the defendants altered the fee structure in ways that reduced Heyer's proceeds. This alleged redirection of funds did not necessarily injure the company-which was allegedly offsetting would-be injuries with compensating benefits-but it certainly injured Heyer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   That resolves the issue. \"[A] shareholder may proceed against his company on an individual basis\" when there is a \"special injury to the individual stockholder.\"\n   <em>\n    Cowin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3802400,618438\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/741/410/\">\n    741 F.2d at 415\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks and emphasis omitted).

The defendants argue that the breach of contract claim against Schwartz must be dismissed because the alleged contracts were between Heyer and Schwartz &amp; Associates-the company-which means that Schwartz cannot be personally liable. Defs.' Br. at 14-15. Heyer responds that the contracts at issue were not only between Heyer and the company but were also between Heyer and Schwartz in his individual capacity. Opp'n at 19, Dkt. 11.

It is clear that the parties contemplated the $150,000 being drawn from funds paid by the client to Schwartz &amp; Associates, not from Schwartz's personal bank account.

Dkt. 7. Specifically, the motion is granted only with respect to Count Two (for breach of contract against Schwartz), which is dismissed with prejudice. The motion is denied in all other respects. Thus, Count One (breach of contract against Schwartz &amp; Associates), Count Three (breach of fiduciary duty against Schwartz), and Count Four (negligent misrepresentation against Schwartz) are not dismissed. A separate order consistent with this decision accompanies this memorandum opinion.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
