Pope, a Georgia state prisoner proceeding pro se, filed a habeas corpus petition alleging ineffective assistance of state appellate counsel, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. The district court determined that Pope\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition was procedurally barred. This Court then granted a Certificate of Appealability on the issue of whether Pope\u2019s \u201cclaims of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel for counsel\u2019s failure to raise a claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel regarding the admission of a prior conviction [were] procedurally barred.\u201d After review, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b883-8\">On appeal, Pope argues that his claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel is not procedurally barred because he raised the claim in his state habeas proceedings. The record reveals that Pope did raise a claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel in his state habeas petition. However, after his state habeas petition was denied, Pope did not apply for a certificate of probable cause to appeal that denial to the Georgia Supreme Court. Pope\u2019s failure to apply for a certificate of probable cause to appeal the denial of his state habeas petition to the Georgia Supreme Court means that Pope has failed to exhaust all of his available state remedies. Consequently, Pope is procedurally barred from raising his claims of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel in a federal \u00a7 2254 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-12\">Section 2254 provides that \u201c[a]n application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court shall not be granted unless it appears that ... the applicant has exhausted the remedies available in the courts of the State....\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b)(1). Pursuant to \u00a7 2254(c), a state prisoner \u201cshall not be deemed to have exhausted the remedies available in the courts of the State ... if he has the right under the law of the State to raise, by any available procedure, the question presented\u201d and failed to do so. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b883-13\">Furthermore, the United States Supreme Court has interpreted \u00a7 2254(c) to require a state prisoner to present his claims to the state\u2019s highest court, even if review is discretionary, when such review is part of the ordinary appellate review procedure. <em>O\u2019Sullivan v. Boerckel, </em>526 U.S. 838, 845, 119 S.Ct. 1728, 1732-33, 144 L.Ed.2d 1 (1999) (involving the Illinois direct appeal process). The Supreme Court stated that this requirement was to \u201cgive the state courts one full opportunity to resolve any constitutional issues by invoking one complete round of the State\u2019s established appellate review process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 845, 119 S.Ct. at 1732.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-14\">State prisoners, however, are not required to pursue discretionary review if it would be considered \u201cextraordinary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 844, 119 S.Ct. at 1732. The Supreme Court concluded that \u201cstate prisoners do not have to invoke extraordinary remedies when those remedies are alternatives to the standard review process and where the state courts have not provided relief through those remedies in the past.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b884-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>In <em>Pruitt v. Jones, </em>348 F.3d 1355, 1359 (11th Cir.2003), this Court concluded that <em>Boerckel </em>applies to the state collateral review process as well as the direct appeal process. In <em>Pruitt, </em>an Alabama state prisoner filed a \u00a7 2254 petition that was denied by the state habeas court. Pruitt then appealed to the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals, and the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed the habeas court\u2019s decision. However, Pruitt did not petition the Alabama Supreme Court for discretionary review. <em>Pruitt, </em>348 F.3d at 1357.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-4\">This Court noted that the Alabama court rules provide for discretionary review in the Supreme Court of Alabama, and this requirement could not be characterized as extraordinary within the meaning of <em>Boerckel. Pruitt, </em>348 F.3d at 1359. After so noting, this Court concluded that Pruitt had failed to exhaust his state remedies by failing to petition the Supreme Court of Alabama for discretionary review of the denial of his state habeas petition. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b884-5\">For the same reasons as in <em>Pruitt, </em>we conclude that Pope has failed to exhaust his state remedies by failing to petition the Georgia Supreme Court for a certificate of probable cause to appeal the denial of his state habeas petition. The fact remains that Georgia law provides that a state prisoner may appeal an adverse decision to the Georgia Supreme Court by petitioning for a certificate of probable cause within 30 days of the denial of his state habeas petition. O.C.G.A. \u00a7 9-14-52.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Nothing about O.C.G.A. \u00a7 9-14-52 can be considered \u201cextraordinary\u201d as defined in <em>Boerckel. </em>Consequently, Pope\u2019s failure to petition the Georgia Supreme Court for a certificate of probable cause means that Pope failed to exhaust all of his available state remedies. Therefore, his claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel is procedurally barred, and this Court may not entertain his \u00a7 2254 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b883-9\">.
