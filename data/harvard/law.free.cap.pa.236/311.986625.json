P. J., filed the following opinion:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b343-10\">At the trial it appeared (1) that the common source of title was Joseph T. Mitchell, husband of the plaintiff; (2) that, by a deed dated January 25th, 1902, \u00bfrid duly recorded two days later, he conveyed the. land in dispute to his wife for the expressed consideration of one dollar and natural love and affection; (3) Parol evidence was given which,.if believed by.the.jury, would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>justify them in finding (a) <em>that </em>lie was indebted at tbe time of tbe conveyance to bis wife, (b) that be retained personal property sufficient to meet sucb indebtedness, (c) that this indebtedness arose from an unsettled mutual account between bimself and a firm named Hyndman &amp; Garney, and that Mitcbell believed that upon settlement of tbeir affairs tbe firm would be found to be indebted to bim, (d) that be bad no actual intent, in making tbe conveyance to bis wife, to defraud, binder, or delay tbe said firm, wbicb was bis only creditor, (e) that be was at that time, and bad been for years, a market gardener and expected to continue in that business in another county of this State, (f) that bis motive in making tbe conveyance in question was to make provision for bis wife, generally, and particularly as against apprehended machinations of a brother who bad made trouble for bim in tbe past.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b344-4\">On tbe part of tbe defendant tbe evidence showed (1) that Hyndman &amp; Garney, about six months after tbe conveyance by Mitcbell to bis wife, obtained judgment against Mr. Mitchell before a justice of tbe peace for one hundred ninety-five dollars and nineteen cents ($195.19); (2) that a transcript of this judgment was filed in tbe Common Pleas, and by proper proceedings tbe land in question was sold by tbe sheriff to Fred B. Davis, an attorney, who, with bis wife, conveyed tbe same to W. J. Phillips, tbe defendant, for tbe consideration, expressed in tbe deed, of two thousand, six hundred dollars ($2,600); <em>(3) </em>at the sheriff\u2019s sale referred to, a notice was given by or on behalf of Mrs. Mitcbell that tbe land levied upon and advertised for sale belonged to her and not to her husband, tbe execution defendant; (4) parol evidence was given wbicb, if believed, would warrant tbe jury in finding that Mr. Mitcbell was notified by tbe justice of tbe peace before tbe conveyance by Mitcbell to bis wife, that Hyndman &amp; Garney bad placed in bis bands for collection a claim against Mitcbell, wbicb tbe justice states was tbe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>identical claim for which judgment was obtained in a suit before him after the conveyance. This is denied by Mr. Mitchell who says that the only notice he received from the justice was after the judgment and to the effect that the judgment had been obtained.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b345-5\">The case was submitted to the jury with instructions that though indebted, a man may make provision for his wife by a voluntary conveyance of land, if, nevertheless, he retains sufficient property in his hands from which his creditors, by suit and execution, could compel payment, if necessary, unless such voluntary conveyance were a part of an actual scheme to defraud his creditors. Later on in his charge the trial judge used this language: \u201cThe idea is simply this, gentlemen. That that principle of law is intended to prevent fraud. And a conveyance which has no tendency to defraud anybody is good. If it was intended to defraud the creditors which a man had at the time, or if its tendency was to do it, so as to keep them out of their money, or hinder or delay them, why then it would be void. ... ... On the other hand there is testimony here given by himself, Mr. Mitchell, that he had been endeavoring for a long time to get a settlement with Hyndman &amp; Garney; that they kept his pass book and would not let him have <em>it; </em>and that such was the condition of things, as I remember his testimony, at the time this deed was made. The question might arise in your minds, could he have had the purpose in his mind that a settlement might be in their favor, result in their favor and against him, and that he would try and hinder them from getting their money by putting the property in his wife\u2019s name?......If you believe that he made this deed to his wife in order to hinder and delay creditors which he had at the time he made the deed, including Hyndman &amp; Garney, then your verdict should be for the defendant, because in that case the deed would be void under the statute.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b345-8\">Under all the testimony in the case there could be no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>doubt that the judgment under which the sheriff\u2019s sale took place represented an indebtedness to Hyndman &amp; Garney existing at the time of the conveyance to the wife. And it not being shown that there were any subsequent creditors at all, and it being perfectly apparent that the firm of Hyndman &amp; Garney was an existing and not a subsequent creditor and that the question was distinctly submitted to the jury whether the conveyance to the wife tended to hinder, delay or defraud that particular firm, we do not think that, though the instructions were not so full and complete, perhaps, as they should have been were the rights of subsequent creditors in question, nevertheless they were correct with reference to existing creditors to which class Hyndman &amp; Garney belonged, and could not have injured the defendant who claimed under that firm.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b346-4\">Being of opinion that the case was clearly for the jury and not being satisfied that a new trial should be granted for any of the reason's assigned, the motions are denied and a new trial refused.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b346-5\"><em>Errors assigned </em>were various rulings and instructions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b346-6\"><em>L.
