Ratification may be made by formal action, or by passive acquiescence, but in either event, such acts must be established as will warrant the proper finding. The burden is on the plaintiff to show such acquiescence in, knowledge of, and adoption of his services by the corporation, as will warrant a jury under instructions as to the law, in finding a ratification.</syllabus>\n<otherdate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b157-5\">Argued March 19, 1912.</otherdate>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AnM\">Appeal, No. 3, Jan.

Reed was elected secretary of the company in place of Mr. Franklin Vreeland, resigned, and Mr. Charles M. DeForrest was elected assistant treasurer under the provisions of Article V, Section 2, of the by-laws of the Northwest Townsite Company.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b159-5\">Thereupon the said plaintiff accepted the position of assistant treasurer to which he had been elected, and entered upon the performance of his duties. Immediately prior to the 1st of August, 1911, I learned of the existence of this contract contained in plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit A for the first time and I thereupon informed the plaintiff that I was going to bring it to the attention of the board of directors for their action. The next meeting of the board of directors of the company was on August 1st, 1911, and at that meeting I brought the matter to the attention of said board of directors, who thereupon disapproved of said contract. The minute in reference thereto being expressed in the following language :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b159-6\">\u201cThe matter of making advances to the stock selling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>force was then taken up and the letter of agreement between Mr. Charles M. DeForest and Mr. George M. Bailey, president of the company, was then read, and the entire matter disapproved of. Upon motion of Mr. John P. Whitney, seconded by Mr. Daniel F. Deal, a resolution was adopted authorizing Mr. Daniel F. Deal, vice-president of the company, to secure the services of a competent attorney for the purpose of passing an opinion upon the legality of and how far the actions of the president in entering into this agreement with Mr. Charles M. DeForest without consulting the board of directors was binding on the company.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b160-4\">At a meeting of the board of directors, held August 29th, 1911, the following resolution was passed:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b160-5\">\u201cUpon motion of Mr. Reynolds, seconded by Mr. Whitney, a resolution was passed declaring the office of assistant treasurer now held by Mr. C. M. DeForest vacant, and the secretary instructed to notify Mr. DeForest of such resolution, also the banks and trust companies.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b160-6\">And in accordance with this resolution the plaintiff was notified that he was removed from the office of assistant treasurer and the office declared vacant. Deponent further says that plaintiff made sales of stock for account of the defendant and from time to time rendered statements of account for the same, his commissions thereon amounting to $1,095.50, which have been paid to him, and the sales of stock so made by plaintiff was the only benefit conferred by the said plaintiff upon the said defendant, which has been accepted by it and the same has been fully compensated for at the price and value which the plaintiff claimed and demanded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b160-7\">Deponent further avers that the said George M. Bailey, president of the company, had no authority of any kind whatsoever to execute said agreement, Exhibit A of plaintiff\u2019s statement, so as to make the same binding upon the company defendant except as pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>vided in the by-laws hereinbefore referred to, and deponent is advised by counsel, verily believes and therefore avers that the said by-laws do not confer authority upon the said George M. Bailey as president of the corporation defendant to make the contract sued on, wherein and whereby among other things the defendant should be bound to guarantee to the plaintiff that his income from his work will be at least f5,000 by the end of the year. And he is further advised, verily believes, and therefore avers, that said contract in any of its particulars, is not binding upon the corporation defendant save and except only as it has accepted the benefits thereof, which benefits have been fully paid and satisfied, as is hereinbefore set forth.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b161-3\">All of which deponent verily believes and expects to be able to prove on the trial of the cause.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b161-4\"><em>Error assigned </em>was order making absolute rule for \u2022 judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b161-5\"><em>M.

Suit was brought to recover an alleged balance claimed to be due on a guaranteed annual salary. The contract sued on was made by the president of the corporation without the authority of the board of directors. It is contended for the corporation that no liability attaches to it because the contract was made without authority; while, on the other hand, the appellee here, who was a party to the contract, urges that even if the contract was made without authority in the first instance, the board of directors assented to its terms by acquiescence and thus bound the corporation by ratification. There is no doubt that the board of directors had the power to make the contract relied on to sustain this action, and although that power may not have been exercised in a manner to make it binding on the corporation in the first instance, subsequent ratification may give it binding effect: Kelsey v. National Bank, 69 Pa. 426; Manhattan Hardware Co. v. Phalen, 128 Pa. 110; Wayne Title &amp; Trust Co. v. Railway Company, 191 Pa. 90; Greensboro Gas Co. v. Oil &amp; Gas Co., 222 Pa. 4. We cannot agree with the argument of the learned counsel for appellant, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>upon the facts disclosed by this record, the court should say as a matter of law that no liability attached to the defendant corporation under the contract upon which suit was brought. The president may have exceeded his authority, and no doubt did so, but the question still remains whether the board of directors accepted the services of appellee under the terms of that contract, and by failing to disavow it within a reasonable time, acquiesced in the arrangement to such an extent as to operate as a ratification. Then, again, who shall determine whether there was a ratification? Shall the court say as a matter of law that there was a ratification, or shall this question be submitted to the jury under proper instructions? In some cases this question is for the court and in others for the jury. It depends upon the facts in each particular case. In the case at bar, we have concluded, upon the facts presented by the pleadings, the court was not warranted in holding as a matter of law that there was a ratification. The affidavit of defense was sufficient to prevent judgment and to make it necessary for a trial upon the merits. We agree that ratification may be made by formal action, or by passive acquiescence, but in either event, such facts must be established as will warrant the proper finding. In the present case the ratification relied on by appellee depends upon certain facts and as we view the record these facts are for the jury. The burden will be on the plaintiff to show such acquiescence in, knowledge of, and adoption of his services by the corporation, as will warrant the jury under instructions as to the law, in finding a ratification.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-3\">Judgment reversed and record remitted in order that the case may be tried on its merits.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
