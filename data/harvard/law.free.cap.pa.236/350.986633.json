Certain exceptions were filed by the defendant which were overruled by the court in banc, and an injunction was granted as prayed for in the bill. In disposing of the exceptions, the learned court said, inter alia: \u201cAs a result of the trial on the merits, the trial judge found against the defendant on every point in the controversy. The defendant has filed exceptions which do not controvert the correctness of the court\u2019s finding that (1) the plaintiff\u2019s title to the coal underlying this land is good and the defendant has no. title; and (2) the mining of the coal by the defendant was unlawful and a trespass. Having accepted defeat on the main controversy, the defendant\u2019s exceptions now raise only two incidental questions: (1) The bill should be dismissed because the persons claiming to hold the offices of trustees for the proprietors are not entitled to that office, and therefore had no authority to cause this bill to be filed. (2) The court erred in continuing the injunction to restrain the use of the underground passages.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">The legal effect of the Bennett lease was determined by the trial judge in his opinion and answers to the several points. He held that the lease was for agricultural purposes only, and conferred no authority on the lessee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>to mine and remove coal from the premises or to use the passageways resulting from the removal of the coal. The findings of fact and law from which the judge drew his conclusion as to the interpretation of the lease were not, as suggested by the court below, excepted to and passed upon by the court in banc. Hence, they cannot be considered here, and that eliminates the first question suggested by the appellant company as one of the questions raised and argued by it. Rule 67 of the equity rules provides: \u201cUpon appeal to the Supreme or Superior Court such matters only as have been so excepted to and finally passed upon by the court shall be assignable for error.\u201d Speaking of the rules of equity practice and their enforcement, the present Chief Justice, delivering the opinion in Beatty v. Harris, 205 Pa. 377, says, inter alia: \u201cThey (the rules) expressly direct that the exceptions filed shall cover all objections to rulings on evidence, findings of fact or law, and to the decree of the court; the power is given the judge or the court in banc to sustain or dismiss exceptions, and to confirm, modify or change the decree entered......The object of these rules is to afford an opportunity for a careful review of the rulings made at the trial and of the findings of the court. The rules are mandatory, and their, violation cannot be overlooked.\u201d This language was substantially repeated in the very recent case of Page v. Lytle, 229 Pa. 198.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">In the court below, the appellant company tried the case on the theory that the Bennett lease was a conveyance in fee of the premises. It asked the court to find as a matter of law that \u201cthe intention of the parties was to pass the whole estate, mineral and surface,\u201d which was refused, but the answer of the court is not excepted to nor assigned for error. On the other hand, the trial judge found as a matter of law, in answer to plaintiff\u2019s request, that the mining of the coal by the defendant with the consent of the plaintiff\u2019s tenant and payment of royalties therefor to the tenant constituted a waste <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>of plaintiff\u2019s reversion by the tenant, a trespass in the nature of waste by the defendant, and a fraud upon the plaintiff. This finding was not excepted to nor assigned for error here. In the present condition of the record, we are at a loss to see how we can consider or determine whether the Bennett lease is a lease without impeachment of waste.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">It may, however, be suggested in passing that in a lease for a term of years, where not otherwise provided in the instrument, we have no doubt the tenant was in 1821, as he is now, impeachable for waste. The several remedial statutes on the subject, enacted since 1821, do not define waste nor confer any rights, but simply provide a remedy for what is recognized as a wrongful act and a violation of existing rights. The statutes of Marlborough and Gloucester seem to have been regarded in the same light. Lord Coke says: \u201cNeither this act (Gloucester) nor the statute of Marlbridge doth create new kind of wastes, but do give new remedies for old wastes; and what is waste, and what not, must be determined by the common law\u201d: 2 Inst. 300-1. That waste by a tenant for life or years was an actionable injury to the remainderman or reversioner has been assumed in numerous cases in this court and the lower courts, beginning with the earliest reported decisions. We have held that the statutes allowing the writ of estrepement are simply declaratory of the common law authority of the courts, and that they were passed because the courts did not exercise their authority by injunction to prevent waste as freely as they should have done: Byrne v. Boyle, 37 Pa. 260, 262. Griffin v. Fellows, 81* Pa. 1.14, was an action of ejectment brought by one claiming under the trustees of Providence, another of the seventeen certified townships of Luzerne county. The defendant claimed under the original lessee whose lease, dated in 1796, was very similar to the one under which the defendant here claims, but in the habendum clause contained the additional words: \u201cwith every privilege <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>of mines and minerals of whatever description.\u201d The trial court there held that the defendant was not impeachable for waste in opening and working coal and stone mines on the distinct ground that the estate of the lessee was enlarged by the words above quoted, used in the habendum which, in a deed, determines what estate is granted. In discussing the question involved in the case, the learned trial court in an elaborate opinion, adopted by this court, said inter alia (p. 122): \u201cIt is an important fact in the case that there were no open mines or quarries on the premises at the date of the lease; that mining of coal was first commenced by the tenant in 1810, and quarrying stone in 1855 or 1856. These acts were to the prejudice of the reversioner, and were undoubtedly waste, operating as a forfeiture of the term and entitling the lessor to recover the premises by ejectment, unless they were authorized by the lease, or the forfeiture was by some act of his......In a lease designed merely for agricultural purposes there is no occasion to say anything in regard to the mines or minerals, where there are no open mines, unless it is intended to grant some interest therein. When they <em>are </em>mentioned it must be considered that there was a <em>purpose </em>in doing so.\u201d The court further held that its interpretation of the lease was sustained by the fact that the lessee had for more than half a century operated the mines with the knowledge of the lessors, who had regularly received the stipulated rent. In the case at bar the operative words in the lease are simply \u201cdemise, set and to farm let,\u201d without any words in any part of the lease referring to the minerals, which were never opened on the premises. For sixty years immediately subsequent to the letting the parties had treated the lease as one for agricultural purposes only.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">The other and only question properly determinable here, the right of the appellant to use the passageways through the coal, requires but brief consideration. We are not impressed with the argument of the appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>company that it should he permitted to continue its trespasses on the plaintiff\u2019s premises by using the passageways because \u201cthe public is in urgent need of all the coal that can be mined at the present time.\u201d The issue here is not between \u201cthe public\u201d and the plaintiff, but between the latter and the appellant company which, as determined by the court, was not the owner of the coal and was a trespasser in mining and removing it. It is true that the tenant or the appellant company holding under him was in possession of the land under the lease for agricultural purposes, but only for such purposes. The company did not own the coal and was not authorized by the lease to remove it. In mining the coal, therefore, it was a trespasser; and in using the passageways made by its own wrongful act, it is simply continuing its trespasses against the reversion, which a court of equity, regardless of there being a remedy at law, will always enjoin: Walters v. McElroy, 151 Pa. 549. As said by the learned trial judge, to permit the appellant company to continue the use of the passageways would be inequitable in that it would be allowing it to profit by its own wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">The decree is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
