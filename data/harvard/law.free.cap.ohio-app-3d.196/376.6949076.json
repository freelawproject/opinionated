Carpenter, filed January 13, 2011, and Richard D. Arthur and Chanin L. Clymer, filed January 14, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-16\">{\u00b6 2} The appellants appeal from the December 20, 2010 \u201cJudgment Entry Adopting Magistrate\u2019s Decision (Revised) on Motion of Defendants George Long and Big Hill Realty Corp., dba Big Hill GMAC Real Estate for Summary Judgment on all Claims (in both Cases) [and the] Judgment Entry Adopting Magistrate\u2019s Decision (Revised) on Motion of Defendant Stoneridge Development, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>LTD for Summary Judgment on Plaintiffs\u2019 Arthur\u2019s and Clymer\u2019s First Claim for Relief Against Stoneridge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\">{\u00b6 3} On March 12, 2008, Carpenter filed a complaint in the common pleas court against Long, a real estate agent, and Big Hill Realty Corporation (\u201cBig Hill\u201d), in case No. 2008 CV 0317, asserting claims of negligent misrepresentation, professional negligence, negligence, and respondeat superior liability. Carpenter asserts that she owned real property at 1955 N. Old Fairfield Road in Beaver-creek and that in September 1998, she entered into an \u201cOption and Lease Agreement\u201d with AT &amp; T Wireless, pursuant to which AT &amp; T Wireless installed and operated an antenna on her property in exchange for monthly rent. In December 1998, AT &amp; T Wireless assigned its rights and obligations to Cincinnati Bell Wireless, and in July 1999, Carpenter and Cincinnati Bell Wireless entered into an amended lease agreement that allowed for the antenna to be relocated on the property. In 2005, Carpenter entered into an agreement with Long to sell the Old Fairfield Road property. After March 2006, Long became a dual agent, representing both Carpenter and Stoneridge Development Ltd. (\u201cStoneridge\u201d), which purchased the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">{\u00b6 4} In June 2006, as part of the sale of the property, Carpenter and Stoneridge executed an \u201cAssumption Agreement,\u201d which provided that Cincinnati Bell Wireless would continue to make rental payments to Carpenter. Carpenter also executed an \u201cAssignment of Lease,\u201d in which she assigned her lease rights to Stoneridge, and Stoneridge executed an \u201cAssignment of Rent Payments,\u201d granting Carpenter the rights to the rental payments. These documents were not recorded with the county recorder\u2019s office. According to Carpenter, Long assured her that her interest in the rental income was protected.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">{\u00b6 5} In July 2006, Long acted as agent in the sale of the Old Fairfield Road property to Arthur and Clymer. In October 2006, Cincinnati Bell Wireless stopped making rental payments to Carpenter and filed an interpleader action in the Greene County Court of Common Pleas in case No. 2006-CV-0885. The basis of the interpleader action was that Arthur and Clymer had asserted a claim to the rental payments, and Cincinnati Bell Wireless asked the court to determine the proper recipient(s) of the rental income. Carpenter filed a cross-claim against Arthur and Clymer, asserting that she had \u201csuffered damages as a result of Arthur and Clymer\u2019s tortious interference because she is now prohibited from receiving rent payments.\u201d Arthur and Clymer filed a third-party claim against Stoneridge, which they later dismissed. After mediation, the matter was settled, and the trial court issued a dismissal entry with prejudice, as well as an agreed entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">{\u00b6 6} In her complaint herein, Carpenter argues that she \u201csuffered damages * * * because in October of 2006, Cincinnati Bell Wireless stopped making rental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>payments to Plaintiff Carpenter and filed an interpleaded [sic] action.\u201d According to Carpenter, Long failed to ensure that the documents pertaining to her rights to receive the rental income were recorded and failed to include her right to receive the rental income in the purchase contract between Stoneridge and Arthur and Clymer so as to provide Arthur and Clymer with notice of Carpenter\u2019s interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">{\u00b6 7} On April 11, 2008, Arthur and Clymer filed a complaint in the Montgomery County Court of Common Pleas against Long, Big Hill, and Stoneridge, which was later transferred to Greene County as case No. 2008 CV 1173. In their first claim for relief, Arthur and Clymer asserted breach of contract and warranty against Stoneridge. Arthur and Clymer claim that they were damaged \u201cto the extent of the portion of the cell tower rentals assigned to Anna Carpenter through 9/1/2015, and the attorney fees incurred by the Plaintiffs in defending the Interpleader action.\u201d In their second claim for relief, Arthur and Clymer assert that Long and Big Hill breached their agency duties by \u201cfailing to except the cell tower rentals from the written purchase agreement and failing to except the cell tower rentals from the warranty deed delivered by said defendants to the closing agent on or about July 14, 2006.\u201d In their third claim for relief, Arthur and Clymer assert that Long and Big Hill \u201cbreached their duties to exercise ordinary care to protect the interests of their principals,\u201d causing them \u201cto incur money damages as described above.\u201d In their fourth claim for relief, Arthur and Clymer assert that \u201cDefendant Long was working and acting within the scope of his employment as an employee, agent, and officer of the Defendant Big Hill Realty Corp.\u201d and that \u201csaid Defendants acquiesced in, ratified, and benefitted from the actions of Defendant Long.\u201d On March 5, 2009, the magistrate consolidated Carpenter\u2019s case with that of Arthur and Clymer.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">{\u00b6 8} Stoneridge filed a cross-claim in the Montgomery County Court of Common Pleas that was transferred to Greene County, asserting that Stoneridge is entitled to indemnity from Long and Big Hill.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">{\u00b6 9} On September 18, 2009, Long and Big Hill filed a motion for summary judgment \u201con all claims.\u201d On November 2, 2009, Stoneridge filed a motion for summary judgment against Arthur and Clymer. The matter was referred to a magistrate, and on May 11, 2010, after a hearing, the magistrate granted summary judgment in favor of Long, Big Hill, and Stoneridge, denied all claims of Carpenter against Long and Big Hill, and denied all claims of Arthur and Clymer against Long, Big Hill, and Stoneridge.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">{\u00b6 10} On May 18, 2010, Carpenter, Arthur, and Clymer jointly filed a request captioned \u201cJoint Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law,\u201d asking that the magistrate provide specific findings of fact and conclusions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>{\u00b6 11} On June 1, 2010, the magistrate issued a revised decision. The revised decision incorporated, \u201cas if fully set forth herein, and as Findings of Fact in this Decision, the undisputed and unrebutted Statement of Fact at Section II of the Long/Big Hill Motion for Summary Judgment.\u201d The magistrate relied heavily upon <em>Hoover v. Transcontinental Ins. Co., </em>Greene App. No. 2003-CA-46, 2004-Ohio-72, 2004 WL 41489, which addresses the use of nonmutual defensive collateral estoppel to prohibit a party or another person from relitigating an issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">{\u00b6 12} According to the magistrate\u2019s revised decision, the undisputed facts upon which the granting of summary judgment rests were set forth in the agreed entry filed by the court on November 16, 2007, in the interpleader case, a certified copy of which is attached to Long and Big Hill\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The decision further notes, \u201cBoth sets of defendants in the Inter-pleader case brought by Cincinnati Bell Wireless, Richard D. Arthur and Chanin L. Clymer, and Anna S. Carpenter, maintained in their Answers that they were entitled to the <em>entire </em>lease payment from Cincinnati Bell Wireless for the communications/antennae facility on the property at 1955 Old N. Fairfield Road, Beavercreek, Ohio. But, in their Agreed Entry ordered by the Court, the Parties, by mutual agreement, litigated away that issue with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cBoth sets of Defendants in the Interpleader action agreed that Carpenter would receive $750.00 per month rental income for Cincinnati Bell Wireless\u2019 use of the property, commencing December 1, 2007 and continuing each month with the final payment ending September 1, 2015. In the same Agreed Entry, Defendants Arthur/Clymer were ordered to receive the balance of all rental income paid pursuant to the Lease, including any and all increases and/or reimbursements, and [any] other obligations owed by Lessor to the Lessee thereunder. In the Agreed Entry, the Parties also agreed that \u2018All rental payments deposited by Plaintiff, Cincinnati Bell Wireless, to the Clerk of Courts from November 1, 2006 and thereafter shall be divided as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-7\">\u201c1) 50% to Defendants Arthur/Clymer</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-8\">\u201c2) 50% to Defendant Carpenter.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis sic.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-9\">{\u00b6 14} The magistrate noted that the agreed entry provides, \u201c \u2018All claims in this Case shall be dismissed with prejudice within 30 days from the date of this Agreement.\u2019 On November 16, 2007 the Court filed a Dismissal Entry ordering that the Interpleader Case was dismissed with prejudice.\u201d The decision notes that Carpenter and Arthur and Clymer \u201cboth ask the Court, implicitly, as a preliminary matter, to determine that each set of Plaintiffs was entitled to receipt of the entire lease payment from Cincinnati Bell Wireless * * *. The adjudication of that preliminary issue is a predicate to the Court\u2019s next determining that the Defendants in the two cases, Long and Big Hill in 2008 CY 0317 and 2008 CV <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>1173, and also Stoneridge in 2008 CV 1173, are liable to Plaintiffs for the portion of the cell tower lease payment from Cincinnati Bell Wireless that Plaintiffs voluntarily relinquished by the Agreed Entry filed on November 16, 2007 in Interpleader Case No. 2006 CV 0885. Both sets of Plaintiffs are asking this Court to adjudicate which Plaintiff was the proper recipient of the entire monthly rental payments from Cincinnati Bell Wireless, and to assign liability for the Plaintiffs not receiving the full rental payment, to George Long and Big Hill Realty in the Case of Anna Carpenter and to George Long, Big Hill Realty, and Stoneridge in the Case of Arthur &amp; Clymer.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cBut that question of whether Anna Carpenter or Arthur &amp; Clymer should have been entitled to receive the entire cell tower rental payment was fully adjudicated in Interpleader Case No. 2006 CV 0885.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">{\u00b6 16} \u201cThe Defendants in that Case, who are the two sets of Plaintiffs in the two cases currently pending before the Court, had the opportunity to litigate the issue in the Interpleader action brought by Cincinnati Bell Wireless.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cAlthough the two sets of Plaintiffs in the two cases pending before the Court recited in their Agreed Entry that they did not intend for the Agreement to release any claims or causes of action they may have against third persons or entities not a party to this [A]greement, the Magistrate concludes as a matter of law, that Plaintiffs are subject to the doctrine of non-mutual defensive collateral estoppel. That doctrine is applicable when a party against whom the doctrine is asserted previously had his day in court and had the opportunity to fully litigate the specific issue sought to be raised in a later action. Plaintiffs herein, the Defendants in the Interpleader Case, may not escape the applicability of the law by expressing their intention to avoid the law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">{\u00b6 18} The magistrate noted that Long, Big Hill, and Stoneridge all pleaded the affirmative defense of estoppel in their answers to the plaintiffs\u2019 complaints. Relying upon <em>Hoover, </em>2004-Ohio-72, 2004 WL 41489, the magistrate concluded that the plaintiffs in the two pending cases \u201chad their day in court on the specific issue brought into litigation * * *. That issue was: What party was entitled to receive the cell tower rental payments from Cincinnati Bell Wireless * *</p>\n<p id=\"b420-9\">{\u00b6 19} The magistrate continued, \u201cAlthough Long, Big Hill and Stoneridge were not parties to 2006 CV 0885, collateral estoppel applies in this case in the absence of mutuality of parties. This issue of the proper recipients of the cell tower rental payments is <em>res judicata </em>and Plaintiffs are collaterally estopped to raise it again in the two pending cases. And Plaintiffs have raised the issue for adjudication by the Court. The alleged liability of the named Defendants for the sets of Plaintiffs\u2019 receiving less than the entire rental payment, necessarily requires an adjudication by the Court that one or the other of the Plaintiffs was entitled to the entire rental payment before liability may be attributed to any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>Defendant for the respective Plaintiffs receiving less than the entire cell tower rental payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">{\u00b6 20} \u201cThe Magistrate concludes that the intent of the two sets of Plaintiffs in the two Cases now, expressed in the Agreed Entry, when they were Defendants in the Interpleader case, not to release claims or causes of action that they might have against third persons, does not displace the applicable law as enunciated in <em>Hoover </em>[, 2004-Ohio-72, 2004 WL 41489], and the cases relied on in that opinion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">{\u00b6 21} Regarding Stoneridge\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the magistrate found \u201cliability under the Complaint in 2008 CV 1173 is only with respect to breach of contract and breach of warranty to the extent of the portion of the cell tower rentals assigned to Anna Carpenter thru September 1, 2015. Hence, Arthur &amp; Clymer are trying to recoup the cell rentals from Stoneridge that were paid to Anna Carpenter by virtue of the Agreed Judgment Entry in 2006 CV 0885. Arthur and Clymer relinquished their right to pursue those very damages when they agreed to the precise allocation and adjudication of cell tower rental income between themselves and Anna Carpenter in the Agreed Judgment Entry. Hence, Arthur &amp; Clymer are also precluded by estoppel from pursuing against Stoneridge in this Case, the same claim that was fully adjudicated in 2006 CV 0885. As far as the Cross-Claim of Stoneridge against Long and Big Hill Realty, a claim for indemnity; there being no liability on the part of Long and Big Hill Realty Corp., there is no liability for indemnity on the part of Stoneridge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">{\u00b6 22} Carpenter and Arthur and Clymer filed objections, and on December 20, 2010, the trial court issued a decision adopting the magistrate\u2019s revised decision. After setting forth the appropriate standard of review (de novo) and quoting from <em>Hoover, </em>2004-Ohio-72, 2004 WL 41489, the trial court overruled all objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision, finding that \u201c[a]ll the requirements of <em>Hoover </em>* * * for application to these two Cases have been met, and the doctrine of non-mutual defensive collateral estoppel entitles Defendants to summary judgment in their favor against Plaintiffs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">I. Carpenter\u2019s appeal</p>\n<p id=\"AqR\">A. Res Judicata</p>\n<p id=\"b421-9\">{\u00b6 23} Carpenter asserts four assignments of error. Her first assignment of error is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b421-10\">{\u00b6 24} \u201cThe trial court erred as a matter of law by granting summary judgment and misapplying the doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel and thereby preventing this action from proceeding forward.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b421-11\">{\u00b6 25} \u201cCiv. R. 56(C) provides that summary judgment may be granted when the moving party demonstrates that (1) there is no genuine issue of material fact, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>(2) the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and (3) viewing the evidence most strongly in favor of the nonmoving party, reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion and that conclusion is adverse to the party against whom the motion for summary judgment is made.\u201d <em>Cohen v. G/C Contracting Corp., </em>Greene App. No. 2006 CA 102, 2007-Ohio-4888, 2007 WL 2743707, \u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">{\u00b6 26} \u201cWhen reviewing a trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, an appellate court conducts a de novo review. <em>Grafton v. Ohio Edison Co., </em>77 Ohio St.3d 102, 105, 671 N.E.2d 241, 1996-Ohio-336. \u2018De Novo review means that this court uses the same standard that the trial court should have used, and we examine the evidence to determine whether as a matter of law no genuine issues exist for trial.\u2019 <em>Brewer v. Cleveland City Schools Bd. of Edn. </em>(1997), 122 Ohio App.3d 378, 383, 701 N.E.2d 1023, citing <em>Dupler v. Mansfield Journal Co. </em>(1980), 64 Ohio St.2d 116, 119-120, 413 N.E.2d 1187.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">{\u00b6 27} \u201cTherefore, the trial court\u2019s decision is not granted any deference by the reviewing appellate court.\u201d <em>Selective Ins. Co. of Am. v. Arrowood Indemn. Co., </em>Montgomery App. No. 23400, 2010-Ohio-557, 2010 WL 580984, \u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">{\u00b6 28} Carpenter asserts that the trial court failed to apply \u201cthe appropriate standard\u201d herein and that <em>State ex rel. Davis v. Public Emps. Retirement Bd., </em>120 Ohio St.3d 386, 2008-Ohio-6254, 899 N.E.2d 975, and not <em>Hoover, </em>2004-Ohio-72, 2004 WL 41489, applies. We first examine <em>Hoover, </em>upon which the trial court relied. Hoover was injured while riding in a vehicle driven by his son. He sought underinsured-motorist benefits under commercial automobile and general-liability policies issued to his closely held corporation, as compensation for cognitive amnestic disorder allegedly caused by the accident. We affirmed the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment against Hoover. It had been determined, in a workers\u2019 compensation proceeding, that Hoover did not suffer from cognitive amnestic disorder as a proximate result of the injuries he sustained in the accident, and we concluded that Hoover was collaterally estopped from seeking insurance benefits based on the same disorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">{\u00b6 29} Hoover argued on appeal that the trial court erred in applying collateral estoppel to him because his son, who drove the vehicle in the accident, and the insurance companies, from whom he sought benefits, were not parties in the prior workers\u2019 compensation action. We reasoned, \u201cThis argument implicates the concept of mutuality. As Mr. Hoover properly notes, \u2018[i]n Ohio, the general rule is that mutuality of parties is a requisite to collateral estoppel, or issue preclusion. As a general principle, collateral estoppel operates only where all of the parties to the present proceedings were bound by the prior judgment. A judgment, in order to preclude either party from relitigating an issue, must be preclusive on both.\u2019 <em>Goodson v. McDonough Power Equip., Inc. </em>(1983), 2 Ohio St.3d 193, 443 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>N.E.2d 978 at paragraph one of the syllabus.\u201d <em>Hoover, </em>2004-Ohio-72, 2004 WL 41489, \u00b6 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">{\u00b6 30} We agreed that under the \u201cforegoing general rule, Mr. Hoover\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation action undoubtedly would have no collateral estoppel effect on the present litigation because the defendants in this case were not parties to the workers\u2019 compensation action and were not bound by the judgment in that case. The crucial issue is whether an exception to the general rule allowed the trial court to apply collateral estoppel absent mutuality of parties. In <em>Goodson </em>[, 2 Ohio St.3d 193, 443 N.E.2d 978], the Ohio Supreme Court acknowledged that there may be exceptions to the general requirement of mutuality. In particular, the <em>Goodson </em>court cited <em>Hicks v. De La Cruz </em>(1977), 52 Ohio St.2d 71, 369 N.E.2d 776, as an example of its willingness to \u2018relax\u2019 the mutuality requirement \u2018where justice would reasonably require it.\u2019 <em>Goodson, </em>supra, at 199, 443 N.E.2d 978.\u201d <em>Hoover, </em>2004-Ohio-72, 2004 WL 41489, \u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">{\u00b6 31} \u201cIn <em>Hicks, </em>a negligence action, the city of Cincinnati sought to argue that it had immunity from liability because the Cincinnati General Hospital was a state-owned facility. On review, the Ohio Supreme Court noted that the city had taken the opposition position in an earlier case * * *, wherein the city had argued, and a court had found, that it owned, operated, and controlled the hospital. In light of [the earlier case], the <em>Hicks </em>court concluded that collateral estoppel precluded the city from re-litigating its ownership of the hospital even without mutuality of parties. In support of its decision, the <em>Hicks </em>court reasoned, in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">{\u00b6 32} \u201c \u2018The modern view of res judicata embraces the doctrine of collateral estoppel, which basically states that if an issue of fact or law actually is litigated and determined by a valid and final judgment, such determination being essential to that judgment, the determination is conclusive in a subsequent action between the parties, whether on the same or a different claim. <em>A party precluded under this principle from relitigating an issue with an opposing party likewise is precluded from doing so with another person unless he lacked a full and fair opportunity to litigate that issue in the first action, or unless other circumstances justify according him an opportunity to relitigate that issue.\u2019 Hicks, </em>supra, at 74, 369 N.E.2d 776 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">{\u00b6 33} \u201cIn <em>Goodson, </em>the Ohio Supreme Court rejected an argument that <em>Hicks </em>constituted an abandonment of the requirement of mutuality. Rather, the <em>Goodson </em>court read <em>Hicks </em>as creating a narrow exception to the mutuality rule, explaining:</p>\n<p id=\"b423-9\">{\u00b6 34} \u201c \u2018This court in effect was stating in <em>Hicks </em>that under those facts where it was shown that the party defendant clearly had his day in court on the specific issue brought into litigation within the later proceeding, the non-party plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>could rely upon the doctrine of collateral estoppel to preclude the re-litigation of that specific issue. We believe this exception to the principle of mutuality to be a proper one.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">{\u00b635} * *</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">{\u00b6 36} \u201c \u2018The main legal thread which runs throughout the determination of the applicability of res judicata, inclusive of the adjunct principle of collateral estoppel, is the necessity of a fair opportunity to fully litigate and to be \u201cheard\u201d in the due process sense. Accordingly, an absolute due process prerequisite to the application of collateral estoppel is that the party asserting the preclusion must prove that the identical issue was actually litigated, directly determined, and essential to the judgment in the prior action. * * <em>Goodson, </em>supra, at 200-201, 443 N.E.2d 978.\u201d <em>Hoover, </em>2004-Ohio-72, 2004 WL 41489, \u00b6 9-14.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">{\u00b6 37} In <em>Hoover </em>we noted that after <em>Goodson, </em>courts have \u201cexpressed some uncertainty and disagreement regarding the scope of the mutuality exception discussed above,\u201d and we noted cases in which the mutuality exception was narrowly interpreted. <em>Hoover </em>at \u00b6 15. We further noted that a \u201creview of Ohio case law indicates, however, that no other appellate district has interpreted the exception so narrowly. Among the other appellate districts to have addressed the issue, the apparent consensus is that <em>Hicks </em>and <em>Goodson </em>in essence eliminate the mutuality requirement if the party against whom collateral estoppel is asserted has had his day in court in a prior action and, in that forum, was permitted to fully and fairly litigate the specific issue raised in a later proceeding. In <em>McCrory v. Children\u2019s Hospital </em>(1986), 28 Ohio App.3d 49, 53, 501 N.E.2d 1238, a Tenth District case, then-judge Thomas Moyer reached precisely this conclusion, relying on the language from <em>Goodson </em>quoted above.\u201d Id.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">{\u00b6 38} We also noted that \u201cin more recent cases the Ohio Supreme Court has indicated that collateral estoppel applies \u2018 \u201cwhen the fact or issue (1) was actually and directly litigated in the prior action, (2) was passed upon and determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, and (3) <em>when the party against whom collateral estoppel is asserted was a party [or] in privity with a party to the prior action. \u201d \u2019 New Winchester Gardens, Ltd. v. Franklin County Bd. of Revision, </em>80 Ohio St.3d 36, 41 * * * (emphasis added), quoting <em>Thompson v. Wing, </em>70 Ohio St.3d 176, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>183. * * * This court recently set forth a similar test for the application of collateral estoppel in <em>Brady v. Brady, </em>Montgomery App. No. 19006, 2002-Ohio-1879 [2002 WL 626963]. Insofar as mutuality is concerned, we stated only that the party against whom collateral estoppel is sought must have been a party, or in privity with a party, to the prior action. Id. at *3.\u201d We determined, consistent with <em>McCrory </em>and other cases cited in our decision, that those authorities suggest that \u201cmutuality is not required if the party against whom collateral estoppel is asserted fully litigated an issue in an earlier action.\u201d <em>Hoover, </em>2004-Ohio-72, 2004 WL 41489, \u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">{\u00b6 39} We concluded, \u201calbeit with some reluctance, that Ohio law allows the use of non-mutual defensive collateral estoppel when a party against whom the doctrine is asserted previously had his day in court and was permitted to fully litigate the specific issue sought to be raised in a later action.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">{\u00b6 40} Regarding <em>Davis, </em>Carpenter\u2019s recitation of the collateral-estoppel rule, as set forth therein, is identical to the three-part rule set forth in <em>Hoover. Davis, </em>120 Ohio St.3d 386, 2008-Ohio-6254, 899 N.E.2d 975, \u00b6 28, citing <em>Goodson, 2 </em>Ohio St.3d at 210, 443 N.E.2d 978 (\u2018an absolute due process prerequisite to the application of collateral estoppel is that the party asserting the preclusion must prove that the identical issue was actually litigated, directly determined, and essential to the judgment in the prior action\u201d). <em>McCrory, </em>28 Ohio App.3d at 54, 501 N.E.2d 1238.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">{\u00b6 41} <em>Davis </em>noted, \u201cWhen an issue is not actually litigated and decided in the previous proceeding, collateral estoppel does not preclude the issue from being litigated in the subsequent proceeding. [Citation omitted.] This actual-litigation requirement for the application of collateral estoppel is explained in 1 Restatement of the Law 2d, Judgments (1982) 256-257, Section 27, Comment e:</p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">{\u00b6 42} \u201c \u2018A judgment is not conclusive in a subsequent action as to issues which might have been but were not litigated and determined in the prior action. There are many reasons why a party may choose not to raise an issue, or to contest an assertion, in a particular action. * * * The interests of conserving judicial resources, of maintaining consistency, and of avoiding oppression or harassment of the adverse party are less compelling when the issue on which preclusion is sought has not actually been litigated before. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b425-9\">{\u00b6 43} \u201c \u2018It is true that it is sometimes difficult to determine whether an issue was actually litigated; even if it was not litigated, the party\u2019s reasons for not litigating it in the prior action may be such that preclusion would be appropriate. But the policy considerations outlined above weigh strongly in favor of nonpreclusion, and it is in the interest of predictability and simplicity for such a result to obtain uniformly.\u2019 \u201d <em>Davis, </em>120 Ohio St.3d 386, 2008-Ohio-6254, 899 N.E.2d 975, \u00b6 30-32.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>{\u00b6 44} Carpenter also relies upon <em>Rieger v. Montgomery Cty., </em>Montgomery App. Nos. 23145 and 23162, 2009-Ohio-4125, 2009 WL 2489855. In <em>Rieger, </em>we reversed the trial court\u2019s decision dismissing Rieger\u2019s consolidated actions against Montgomery County, in which he alleged that he had been wrongly deprived of the ability to buy a firearm under the federal Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, due to the existence of erroneous information on a \u201cBrady Form 10 A\u201d submitted to law-enforcement personnel, in case No. 07 CV 7374, and his action against the sheriff, seeking damages for a violation of his civil rights due to the erroneous \u201cBrady Form 10 A,\u201d in case No. 08 CV 8912. The erroneous information at issue was that Rieger was \u201csubject to a CSPO [civil stalking protective order] precluding him from harassing, stalking, or threatening an \u2018intimate partner.\u2019 \u201d Id. at \u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">{\u00b6 45} Regarding his case against Montgomery County, Section 925A, Title 18, U.S.Code provides that any person denied a firearm \u201c \u2018due to the provision of erroneous information relating to the person by any State or political subdivision thereof * * * may bring an action against the State or political subdivision responsible for providing the erroneous information * * * for an order directing that the erroneous information be corrected}.]\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">{\u00b6 46} \u201cAnother federal statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(8), prohibits the purchase of a firearm by any person subject to a court order that restrains the person \u2018from harassing, stalking, or threatening an intimate partner of such person * * *.\u2019 \u201d Id. at \u00b6 6-7. The trial court noted that the magistrate had found Rieger to be Brady disqualified in an underlying civil-stalking case, which Rieger unsuccessfully appealed, failing to raise the Brady disqualification as an issue. Since any objection to the firearm disqualification could and should have been raised on appeal from the civil-stalking case, and since the complaints in the consolidated cases \u201cwere predicated on the allegedly erroneous Brady disqualification,\u201d res judicata required dismissal. <em>Rieger, </em>2009-Ohio-4125, 2009 WL 2489855, \u00b6 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">{\u00b6 47} After reviewing the record in the civil-stalking case, we determined that \u201cthere is no finding anywhere in that case actually disqualifying Rieger under the Brady Act from purchasing a firearm. * * * That being so, we have no basis for determining that he could have raised his alleged Brady disqualification as an issue on appeal in the civil-stalking case. Because we are unable to conclude that Rieger could have raised a Brady argument as an issue in his civil-stalking appeal, we see no basis for applying the claim-preclusion branch of res judicata to his present complaints.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-8\">{\u00b6 48} We further found the issue-preclusion branch of res judicata \u201cequally inapplicable.\u201d <em>Rieger, </em>2009-Ohio-4125, 2009 WL 2489855, \u00b6 14. We noted that proof of the existence of an intimate relationship between the parties was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>required to obtain a CSPO in the civil-stalking case. Id. We reasoned, \u201c[T]he existence <em>of </em>an \u2018intimate partnership\u2019 or cohabitating relationship was not actually and directly at issue in the civil-stalking case. It follows that the entry granting the victim a CSPO in the civil-stalking case does not preclude Rieger from now seeking to establish that he and the victim were not intimate partners under the federal Brady Act. Therefore, res judicata does not bar him from seeking relief under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 925A on the basis that mistaken information wrongly deprived him of the ability to purchase a firearm. For the same reason, res judicata also does not preclude him from seeking money damages for the submission of the allegedly erroneous information to law-enforcement officials.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">{\u00b6 49} According to Carpenter, <em>Rieger </em>\u201cis similar, but not exactly the same as this case. This court held that the prior litigation was based on a different substantive issue than the subsequent case. The same can be said for this action. The 2006 CV 885 case was solely to determine who was going to receive the monthly cell tower payments and it had nothing to do with who was negligent and the damages therein. The present 2008 CV 317 case concerns Appellee\u2019s misfeasance and the damages therein which occurred as a result of the misfeasance and could not be completely determined until the other case was completed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">{\u00b6 50} Finally, we review our recent decision in <em>Buckeye Retirement Co., L.L.C., Ltd. v. Busch, </em>Greene App. No. 2010 CA 51, 2011-Ohio-1125, 2011 WL 846687. Buckeye Retirement Co., L.L.C., Ltd. (\u201cBuckeye\u201d) appealed from a summary judgment rendered in favor of Busch on the basis of res judicata. We determined that \u201cthe trial court erred in rendering summary judgment in Busch\u2019s favor. Busch was not a party to the prior action, which was an adversary proceeding between Buckeye and a debtor in bankruptcy. Busch is also not in privity with the debtor. Even under relaxed standards of mutuality of interest, Busch is not entitled to the benefit of res judicata, because he would not have been bound by a judgment rendered in the bankruptcy case.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">{\u00b6 51} The facts of <em>Busch </em>are as follows: in 2007, Buckeye sued Busch, Thomas Noland, and the law firm of Statman, Harris &amp; Eyrich for money damages, claiming that Buckeye was the assignee and owner of all claims of a bank formally known as Provident. Provident made loans to Busch\u2019s employer, U.S. Aeroteam, Inc. (\u201cUSAT\u201d), between August and December 2003. Suhas Kakde was the president and majority shareholder of USAT, and he signed a promissory note on behalf of USAT and also personally guaranteed USAT\u2019s loans. Busch was the chief financial officer for USAT, and he prepared, signed, and forwarded financial information, statements, and certified documents to Provident in accordance with the financing agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>{\u00b6 52} In July 2003, Busch and Kakde met with Noland regarding USAT\u2019s potential bankruptcy. On Noland\u2019s instructions, USAT opened an account at another bank, the existence of which it concealed from Provident, and into which it deposited payments from accounts receivable. Busch then sent Provident false financial information that did not include the accurate amount of accounts-receivable payments that USAT had received.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">{\u00b6 53} In late December, 2003, USAT filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Thereafter, judgment was granted in Provident\u2019s favor against Kakde on the promissory note that Kakde had guaranteed. The judgment was assigned to Buckeye. When Kakde filed a personal-bankruptcy action, Buckeye objected to the discharge of Kakde\u2019s debt, and the bankruptcy court concluded that Buckeye did not establish that the debt was nondischargeable. Busch testified as a witness during the hearing on whether Kakde\u2019s debt to Buckeye was dischargea-ble.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">{\u00b6 54} In 2010, Busch filed a motion for summary judgment in Buckeye\u2019s action against Busch, Noland, and the law firm, supported by Kakde\u2019s bankruptcy decision and Busch\u2019s affidavit, in which he averred that he was the \u201cBusch\u201d referred to in the <em>Kakde </em>decision. The trial court granted summary judgment for Busch. \u201cThe court concluded that although Busch was not a party to the <em>Kakde </em>litigation, the relationship between Busch and Kakde was \u2018close enough\u2019 to include Busch within res judicata. The court also concluded that while the claims in the <em>Kakde </em>case were <em>\u2018styled </em>differently\u2019 from the complaint against Busch, \u2018they reach the same conclusion.\u2019 * * * The court held, therefore, that Buckeye\u2019s claims against Busch were barred by res judicata.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) Id., \u00b6 13. The claims against Busch were dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">{\u00b6 55} On appeal, we held, \u201c[T]here is no evidence that Busch either actively participated in, or had control over, the prior lawsuit. More importantly, Busch is a complete stranger to the bankruptcy litigation, and would not have been bound by a result in that case. Therefore, even under the most relaxed standard of mutuality of interests that has been employed, Busch was not in privity with Kakde, and is not entitled to the benefit of claim preclusion. For the same reason, Busch is not entitled to the benefit of issue preclusion, or collateral estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">{\u00b6 56} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b428-9\">{\u00b6 57} \u201cThe correct standard is that in order for res judicata to apply, the parties must be the same or must be in privity with the parties to the prior action, as the term \u2018privity\u2019 has been interpreted by the Supreme Court of Ohio. Under the most recent interpretations of the meaning of privity, Busch \u2014 the party seeking to gain the benefit of res judicata \u2014 was not in privity with Kakde, the party to the prior action. Accordingly, the trial court erred in concluding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>that Busch and Kakde are in privity.\u201d <em>Busch, </em>2011-Ohio-1125, 2011 WL 846687, \u00b6 22, 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\">{\u00b6 58} After thoroughly considering all of the foregoing, we cannot conclude, as we did in <em>Hoover, </em>and as the Tenth District did in <em>McCrory, </em>that this matter presents a narrow exception to the general rule requiring mutuality of parties prior to the application of collateral estoppel. Carpenter is not asserting a contrary position to one previously taken, as did Hoover and the city of Cincinnati, and the judgment in the interpleader action is accordingly not preclusive upon her here. Carpenter seeks to litigate the damages she allegedly sustained due to Long\u2019s and Big Hill\u2019s alleged negligent misrepresentation, professional negligence, and negligence, and on the basis of respondeat superior liability. According to her complaint, these damages were sustained as a direct result of Long\u2019s and Big Hill\u2019s failure to properly protect her interest in the rental income by recording that right and including it in the purchase contract. We cannot conclude that the issue of Long\u2019s and Big Hill\u2019s alleged negligence and any resulting damage is identical to what was actually litigated and directly determined by the interpleader action. To conclude otherwise would deny Carpenter the opportunity to be heard in a due process sense, and justice accordingly does not reasonably require that the mutuality rule be relaxed.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">{\u00b6 59} Regarding <em>Davis, </em>we conclude that the \u201cactual litigation\u201d requirement set forth therein is not satisfied, and since Long\u2019s and Big Hill\u2019s alleged negligence has not been litigated, the interests of conserving judicial resources, maintaining consistency, and avoiding harassment carry less force.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">{\u00b6 60} We agree that <em>Rieger </em>is similar to the matter herein in that in both instances, the prior litigation was based upon a different substantive issue. Rieger could not have raised a Brady argument as an issue in his civil-stalking appeal, because there was no finding in the record in that case disqualifying him from purchasing a firearm. Further, the existence of an intimate relationship was not at issue in the civil-stalking case. Herein, Carpenter could not have litigated Long\u2019s and Big Hill\u2019s alleged bad acts and the resulting damages therefrom in the interpleader action, because Long and Big Hill were not parties to that action. That action was filed by Cincinnati Bell Wireless for a determination of the proper recipient of the rental income, and Carpenter does not seek a redetermination of the issue adjudicated in the interpleader matter. Finally, in considering the requirement of privity discussed in <em>Busch, </em>we conclude that Long and Big Hill were not in privity with Cincinnati Bell Wireless but instead, like Busch, were complete strangers to the earlier interpleader action.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">{\u00b6 61} Accordingly, we agree with Carpenter that the trial court improperly applied the doctrine of res judicata. Having so found, however, we are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>nevertheless required to address the alternative grounds for summary judgment argued below. \u201cThe Supreme Court of Ohio has instructed that \u2018a reviewing court is not authorized to reverse a correct judgment merely because erroneous reasons were assigned as the basis thereof.\u2019 \u201d <em>Snell v. Katafias </em>(Mar. 19, 1999), Montgomery App. No. 17440, 1999 WL 148229, *4, quoting <em>Joyce v. Gen. Motors Corp. </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St.3d 93, 96, 551 N.E.2d 172. Long and Big Hill having asserted that alternative grounds exist justifying the grant of summary judgment in their favor, we will address those before we proceed to Carpenter\u2019s remaining assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">B. Alternative Grounds</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">{\u00b6 62} In their motion for summary judgment, Long and Big Hill asserted that the duties \u201cowed by a real estate agent to sellers, buyers, or as a dual agent, do not reach transactions concerning the transfer of <em>personal property. </em>Rental income is personal property. * * * Without a duty, any negligence or \u2018professional negligence\u2019 claim against Long and Big Hill fails as a matter of law. Here, reasonable minds can only conclude that Ohio law does not contemplate the \u2018duty\u2019 allegedly breached by Long and Big Hill. Thus, summary judgment is warranted with respect to the negligence and \u2018professional negligence\u2019 claims asserted by Carpenter * *</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">{\u00b6 63} Long and Big Hill also asserted that Carpenter\u2019s claim for negligent misrepresentation \u201cfails because neither Long nor Big Hill had a pecuniary interest with respect to the rental income. Indeed, their \u2018pecuniary interest\u2019 would arguably only be for the sale of real property, not the personal property.\u201d According to Long and Big Hill, the \u201cjustifiable reliance element fails because Carpenter retained an attorney before the July 2006 sale to prepare three documents, which were intended to protect her right to receive the rental income. As such, if Carpenter claims Long never told her to secure a lawyer, there was no misrepresentation to rely upon because omissions do not give rise to a negligent misrepresentation claim.\u201d Long and Big Hill claim that \u201cCarpenter sought the advice of her current lawyer who prepared documents that were intended to protect Carpenter\u2019s interests. Thus, Carpenter did not justifiably rely on any alleged statement from Long that he would take care of everything because she sought a lawyer to help her in spite of Long\u2019s alleged representation. Thus, reasonable minds can only conclude that Carpenter did not rely upon any alleged \u2018misrepresentation\u2019 from Long.\u201d Long and Big Hill argued that on the other hand, \u201cif Carpenter received the advice from Long, as he testified that she did, the \u2018false information\u2019 element fails because it is true that Carpenter needed to seek the advice of a lawyer, which she did. Thus, reasonable minds can only conclude that Carpenter cannot establish the \u2018false information\u2019 element.\u201d Final<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>ly, Long and Big Hill asserted that Carpenter\u2019s professional-negligence claim is barred by the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">{\u00b6 64} Attached to Long and Big Hill\u2019s motion for summary judgment are the affidavits of Long and of Cindy Jurcenko, an employee of Cincinnati Bell Wireless. Long\u2019s affidavit provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">{\u00b6 65} \u201c5. Ms. Carpenter wanted to retain her right to receive rental income from the telephone company. As a real estate agent, I lacked expertise in preparing and/or perfecting Ms. Carpenter\u2019s continued right to receive the rental income, since my responsibilities concerned the sale of the real property, not personal property.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">{\u00b6 66} \u201c6. I advised Ms. Carpenter to seek the advice of a lawyer in preparing and following through with the necessary requirements to protect her continued right to receive the rental income. Prior to the July 2006 closing with respect to the sale between Stoneridge and Arthur/Clymer, I understood that Ms. Carpenter had retained the services of a lawyer in regard to protecting her right to receive the rental income as I had advised her to do. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">{\u00b6 67} \u201c7. I was never asked by Ms. Carpenter or the lawyer she retained to hold up the sale to Arthur/Clymer for any reason. I had no reason to believe that the pertinent documents were not in place at the time of the July 2006 sale to Arthur/Clymer. I specifically told Mr. Arthur that neither he nor Clymer would have an interest in the rental income, even after the July 2006 sale was completed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b431-9\">{\u00b6 68} In her affidavit, Jurcenko averred that she corresponded with Joseph Moore, Carpenter\u2019s attorney, concerning the preparation of the assumption agreement, assignment of rent payments, and assignment of lease. Attached to her affidavit are copies of her correspondence with Moore, which reveal that Moore sent her copies of the above documents on January 30, 2006, for her review, and on June 30, 2006, Jurcenko returned revised versions of the documents to Moore. Her June 30 correspondence provides: \u201cI have also attached the Memorandum of Lease with the Exhibit B attached, which will be recorded.\u201d Also attached is a July 14, 2006 e-mail from Jurcenko to Moore, which provides that the \u201c[p]artially executed MOL and Assumption Agreement\u201d are attached and states, \u201c[Kjindly record and return the original MOL for our files.\u201d The e-mail further states, \u201cAs I have mentioned to you in the past, a gentleman named Rick Arthur * * * has contacted me two times. Says he has a contract to purchase Anna\u2019s old home and the adjacent five (5) acres. His closing date is scheduled for July 31, 2006. His contract does not mention anything about the tower. He wanted information regarding the rental income. * * <em>* </em>I directed him back to Stoneridge Development.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b432-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>{\u00b6 69} We will address Long and Big Hill\u2019s arguments in the order best suited for analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">1. Negligent Misrepresentation</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">{\u00b6 70} Carpenter asserted in her claim for negligent misrepresentation that at the closing of the sale of the property to Stoneridge, the assumption agreement, assignment of lease, and assignment of rent payments were executed, but not recorded, and that she \u201cstated that she had concerns about maintaining her rights to the rental payments. Defendant Long, in his capacity as her real estate agent, advised her that she had nothing to worry about.\u201d The complaint further avers that in the course of the sale to Arthur and Clymer, \u201cDefendant Long did not check to see if the lease payment documents * * * had been recorded or to get them recorded prior to the closing on the sale with Arthur and Clymer.\u201d Finally, Carpenter\u2019s complaint states that she \u201cjustifiably relied on the representations made by Defendant Long that her rights to the lease payments would be protected and the documents would be recorded. Defendant Long, in his employment as dual real estate agent for all the various purchasers and sellers, placed himself in a position where he had control as to how the sales could occur and ensuring that proper notice was given to everyone pertaining to all aspects of the sales transactions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">{\u00b6 71} We note, \u201cThe elements of negligent misrepresentation are as follows: \u2018One who, in the course of his business, profession or employment, or in any other transaction in which he has a pecuniary interest, supplies false information for the guidance of others in their business transactions, is subject to liability for pecuniary loss caused to them by their <em>justifiable reliance </em>upon the information, if he fails to exercise reasonable care or competence in obtaining or communicating the information.\u2019 \u201d <em>Delman v. Cleveland Hts. </em>(1989), 41 Ohio St.3d 1, 4, 534 N.E.2d 835. \u201cA negligent misrepresentation occurs when one <em>\u2018supplies false information </em>for the guidance of others.\u2019 (Emphasis sic.) <em>[Textron Fin. Corp. v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1996), 115 Ohio App.3d 137, 149, 684 N.E.2d 1261.] In other words, a \u2018[n]egligent misrepresentation does not lie for omissions; there must be some affirmative false statement.

He said he understood that and he would take care of that for me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b433-11\">{\u00b6 81} Carpenter testified, \u201cGeorge told me over and over every time we brought it up not to worry about a thing.\u201d She identified the purchase contract between her and Stoneridge, and the following exchange occurred as Carpenter reviewed the contract:</p>\n<p id=\"b433-12\">{\u00b6 82} \u201cQ. Now, you see up there in the top where it indicates paragraph four and five, it says described as follows, 1955 Old North Fairfield Road containing eleven point four eight acres, excepting out the two point eight one three one acres, the cell tower, and the two point zero five one seven acres lots.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-13\">{\u00b6 83} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b433-14\">{\u00b6 84} \u201cQ. Do you have any reason to dispute that that language was not included on the contract to purchase before you signed it?</p>\n<p id=\"b433-15\">{\u00b6 85} \u201cA. No, I believe it was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-16\">{\u00b6 86} \u201cQ. And that fairly and accurately represents the conditions you wanted to have in place with respect to the sale of the property, does it not?</p>\n<p id=\"b433-17\">{\u00b6 87} \u201cA. Yes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b433-18\">{\u00b6 88} When asked if she believed that any additional steps were needed to complete the transaction, Carpenter stated, \u201cNo. [Long] just told me not to worry about a thing because he would take care of everything for me, and I believed him at the time.\u201d The following exchange occurred:</p>\n<p id=\"b433-19\">{\u00b6 89} \u201cQ. * * * What was your understanding as to take care of everything? What was your understanding as to what that meant?</p>\n<p id=\"b433-20\">{\u00b6 90} \u201cA. That he was going to be true to his word with the cell tower rental, and when we went to the closing he told me not to worry about anything, so I didn\u2019t worry about anything.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-21\">{\u00b6 91} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>{\u00b6 92} \u201cQ. Now, did George talk to you about needing to seek legal advice with respect to closing off any of the terms and conditions\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">{\u00b6 93} \u201cA. No, he didn\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">{\u00b6 94} Counsel for Long presented Carpenter with a copy of the June 8, 2006 Assumption Agreement, and Carpenter testified that she did not remember the document. When asked if she had an understanding of the purpose of the document, Carpenter responded, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t know.\u201d Carpenter identified her signature on the June 8, 2006 Assignment of Lease (Exhibit H) and on the June 8, 2006 Assignment of Rent Payments (Exhibit I).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">{\u00b6 95} Regarding the Assignment of Rent Payments, the following exchange occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">{\u00b6 96} When Carpenter was asked for her understanding of the document, she said:</p>\n<p id=\"b434-9\">{\u00b6 97} \u201cA. I thought it was taking care of the rental.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-10\">{\u00b6 98} \u201cQ. Right. And so I want to make sure I understand what you\u2019re telling me. * * * [W]ould you agree with me that H and I are the documents that would have been put together to make sure that you had the rental income coming to you each month?</p>\n<p id=\"b434-11\">{\u00b6 99} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b434-12\">{\u00b6 100} \u201cA. No. I don\u2019t think that would take care of everything. It should have been taken care of to my \u2014 the way I feel about it on the contract Clymers (sic) made with George.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b434-13\">{\u00b6 101} Long testified at deposition that \u201cquite a while before the closing,\u201d he recommended to Carpenter that she have a legal document prepared to protect her interest in the rental income and that Carpenter indicated that \u201cshe would do it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b434-14\">{\u00b6 102} Regarding Long and Big Hill\u2019s assertion that Carpenter\u2019s negligent-misrepresentation claim fails because they lacked a pecuniary interest in the transfer of the rental income, Carpenter identified the January 23, 2004 Exclusive Right to Sell contract between her and Big Hill Realty, which provides that Carpenter will pay a 6.00 percent brokerage fee to Big Hill upon the sale of the property, and we cannot conclude that Long and Big Hill lacked a pecuniary interest in the transaction as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-15\">{\u00b6 103} Regarding Long and Big Hill\u2019s argument that \u201comissions do not give rise to a negligent misrepresentation claim,\u201d we note that Carpenter\u2019s complaint asserts that Long represented to her that he was taking care of everything and that the documents protecting her rights to the rental income would be recorded, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>and Long\u2019s alleged failure to advise Carpenter to retain legal counsel is not a basis of her negligent-misrepresentation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">{\u00b6 104} Regarding Long and Big Hill\u2019s assertion that Carpenter cannot satisfy the \u201cfalse information\u201d element of her negligent-misrepresentation claim, because Long allegedly told her to seek legal advice, and \u201cit is true that Carpenter needed to seek the advice of a lawyer,\u201d we again note that Long\u2019s alleged failure to advise Carpenter to seek legal advice does not form a basis of her claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">{\u00b6 105} Finally, Long and Big Hill assert that Carpenter cannot satisfy the justifiable-reliance element of her negligent-misrepresentation claim because she retained an attorney to draft the assumption agreement, assignment of lease, and assignment-of-rent payments, thereby to protect her interests, allegedly belying her claim that she relied upon Long to do so. Carpenter\u2019s testimony is clear that Long repeatedly told her that he himself would protect her interests, and her complaint alleges that Long represented to her that \u201cthe documents would be recorded.\u201d Long asserted that protecting her interest in the income was beyond his expertise, that he advised her to seek a lawyer, and that he \u201chad no reason\u201d to conclude that the documents protecting her interest were \u201cnot in place\u201d at the Arthur/Clymer closing. We conclude that genuine issues of material fact exist regarding the representations made by Long to Carpenter and her reliance thereupon, and viewing the evidence most strongly in favor of Carpenter, we cannot conclude as a matter of law that her reliance upon Long\u2019s alleged representations was not justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">2. The Statute of Limitations</p>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">{\u00b6 106} Long and Big Hill asserted that Carpenter\u2019s claim for professional negligence is barred by the statute of limitations set forth in R.C. 2305.11. We disagree. R.C. 2305.11(A) provides that \u201can action for malpractice other than an action upon a medical, dental, optometric, or chiropractic claim * * * shall be commenced within one year after the cause of action accrued.\u201d R.C. 2305.09(D) provides that an action for \u201can injury to the rights of the plaintiff not arising on contract nor enumerated in sections 1304.35, 2305.10 to 2305.12, and 2305.14 of the Revised Code\u201d shall be brought within four years after the cause of action accrued.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-9\">{\u00b6 107} In <em>Thompson v. Community Mental Health Ctrs. of Warren Cty., Inc. </em>(1994), 71 Ohio St.3d 194, 642 N.E.2d 1102, the Supreme Court of Ohio noted that it \u201cis well-established common law of Ohio that malpractice is limited to the negligence of physicians and attorneys.\u201d \u201cIn a long line of cases interpreting R.C. 2305.11, Ohio courts have consistently refused to extend the statute of limitations to include malpractice claims which are neither specifically enumerated in the terms of the statute nor included in the common-law definition of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>\u2018malpractice.\u2019 \u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Doe v. White </em>(1994), 97 Ohio App.3d 585, 590, 647 N.E.2d 198. \u201cThus, other actions of professional negligence are treated as negligence and governed by the statute of limitations in either R.C. 2305.09 or 2305.10.\u201d Id. Since Carpenter\u2019s second claim for relief does not allege malpractice but rather professional negligence, Long and Big Hill\u2019s reliance upon R.C. 2305.11(A) is misplaced, and R.C. 2305.09(D) instead applies. Because Carpenter\u2019s professional-negligence claim is not untimely, Long and Big Hill are not entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law on the basis of the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">3. The Duty Element of Negligence</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">{\u00b6 108} In her professional-negligence claim, Carpenter asserted that Long \u201chad a duty as a real estate agent to conduct himself in a professional manner which includes protecting [her] interests * * * even after the closing which occurred on June 8, 2006, because her interest was not fully divested and required his expertise and due care to protect her rights to the rental payments.\u201d Carpenter further asserted that Long had \u201cfailed to exercise his professional duty and care to protect [her] interest by: failing to ensure that the documents pertaining to [her] rights to the rental payments had been recorded; failing to write anything in the sales contract with Arthur and Clymer and notifying them of [her] rights; and proceeding forward with the subsequent closing on the property in question without investigating whether the pertinent documents had been recorded prior to the sale/closing of July 14, 2006.\u201d In her claim for negligence, Carpenter asserted that Long failed to exercise ordinary care.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">{\u00b6 109} In support of their assertion that Carpenter cannot satisfy the duty element of her negligence claims, Long and Big Hill relied upon several sections of R.C. Chapter 4735, as well as case law addressed to the statute of frauds. R.C. 4735.52 provides: \u201cExcept to the extent the duties of a real estate agent are specifically set forth in this chapter, or are otherwise modified by agreement, the duties of a real estate agent are determined by the common law.\u201d Long and Big Hill further directed the court\u2019s attention below to R.C. 4735.51(A), which provides, \u201c \u2018Agency and \u2018Agency relationship\u2019 mean a relationship in which a licensee represents another person in <em>a real estate transaction.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) R.C. 4735.01 similarly defines a real estate broker in part as one who, for a \u201cfee, commission, or other valuable consideration,\u201d engages in <em>a real estate transaction.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">{\u00b6 110} Long and Big Hill also relied upon the following case law, which they argued established the nature of the rental income as personal property beyond the scope of the real estate transaction(s): <em>Nonamaker v. Amos </em>(1905), 73 Ohio St. 163, 171, 76 N.E. 949 (an agreement to increase or decrease the royalty on an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>oil lease is not within the statute of frauds because \u201cwhen the parties entered into the parol contract, * * * they were not contracting for an interest in or concerning real estate, but for a division of personal property in proportions different from those named in the written lease\u201d); <em>Negley v. Jeffers </em>(1875), 28 Ohio St. 90, 100 (\u201cWhere a deed has been executed, or a title in any way passed, agreements between the parties as to pecuniary liabilities growing out of the transaction, but not going to take any interest in the land from the grantee, are not affected by the statute of frauds\u201d); <em>Robnolte v. Kohart </em>(1947), 81 Ohio App. 1, 76 N.E.2d 918, paragraph two of the syllabus (\u201cWhen parties in interest agree to sever and remove buildings from the realty, such buildings are held and treated as personalty for the reason that title to the land is in no wise involved, nor is any interest or estate therein, and therefore does not involve a contract within the statute of frauds\u201d). Counsel for Long asked Carpenter about Long\u2019s duty to her in deposition, and the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">{\u00b6 111} \u201cQ. * * * Now, you\u2019ve made certain allegations against George, and I want to ask you what it is that you think he did to breach his duty to you?</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">{\u00b6 112} \u201cA. Well, he knows what he did. He didn\u2019t put it in the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">{\u00b6 113} \u201cQ. He didn\u2019t put what in the contract?</p>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">{\u00b6 114} \u201cA. That the rental was supposed to go to me, and he did not put it in their \u2014 the Clymers\u2019 [sic] contract. If they\u2019d have signed the contract with that in there, we wouldn\u2019t be here today. That\u2019s my feelings. * * * He called my daughter afterwards, after we found out that it wasn\u2019t in their contract and apologized to her and told her he made a big mistake.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b437-9\">{\u00b6 115} We initially note, \u201cIt is well settled that the elements of an ordinary negligence suit are (1) the existence of a legal duty, (2) the defendant\u2019s breach of that duty, and (3) injury that is the proximate cause of the defendant\u2019s breach. <em>Wallace v. Ohio Dept. of Commerce, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 266, 2002-Ohio-4210 [773 N.E.2d 1018, \u00b6 22] citing <em>Mussivand v. David </em>(1989), 45 Ohio St.3d 314, 318 [544 N.E.2d 265]. The duty element of negligence is a question of law for the court to determine. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-10\">{\u00b6 116} \u201cThe Ohio Supreme Court has explained the \u2018duty\u2019 element of a negligence claim as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b437-11\">{\u00b6 117} \u201c \u2018Duty, as used in Ohio tort law, refers to the relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant from which arises an obligation on the part of the defendant to exercise due care toward the plaintiff. This court has often stated that the existence of a duty depends upon the foreseeability of harm: if a reasonably prudent person would have anticipated that an injury was likely to result from a particular act, the court could find that the duty element of negligence is satisfied. In addition, we have also stated that the duty element of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>negligence may be established by common law, by legislative enactment, or by the particular circumstances of a given case.\u2019 \u201d <em>State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co. v. Century 21 Arrow Realty, </em>Cuyahoga App. Nos. 87081, 87108, 2006-Ohio-3967, 2006 WL 2171568, \u00b6 29, quoting <em>Wallace, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 266, 2002-Ohio-4210, 773 N.E.2d 1018, \u00b6 23 (reversing grant of summary judgment in favor of Century 21 and its agent on plaintiff sellers\u2019 negligence claims and holding that plaintiffs established the duty element of negligence as a matter of law).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">{\u00b6 118} \u201cIt is well settled that a real estate agent owes a fiduciary duty to his client. * * * The statutory fiduciary duties owed by a real estate agent to his client * * * are set forth in R.C. 4735.62. [<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>] * * * This list is not exhaustive.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">{\u00b6 119} \u201cIn addition to the statutory duties that are imposed, a real estate agent must still abide by the common law fiduciary duties. Indeed, \u2018real estate brokers have statutory and common law fiduciary duties of disclosure, good faith, and loyalty.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hornung [Horning </em>] <em>v. Fletcher, </em>Mahoning App. No. 05MA07, 2005-Ohio-7078 [2005 WL 3642343, \u00b6 12], quoting <em>Whaley v. Zyndorf/Serchuk, Inc., </em>6th Dist. No. L01 1295, 2002-Ohio-2640 [2002 WL 1290870], \u00b6 8. * * * We also recognize that the common law duty of due care is \u2018that degree of care which an ordinarily reasonable and prudent person exercises, or is accustomed to exercising, under the same or similar circumstances.\u2019 <em>Mussivand, </em>45 Ohio St.3d at 318 [544 N.E.2d 265].</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">{\u00b6 120} \u201cFurthermore, the Ohio Supreme Court has held: \u2018One who acts as an agent for another becomes a fiduciary with respect to matters within the scope of the agency relation. An agent owes his principal a duty to disclose all material information which the agent learns concerning the subject matter of the agency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>relation and about which the principal is not apprised. Furthermore, where a principal suffers loss through his agent\u2019s failure to function in accordance with his duty, the agent becomes liable to the principal for the resulting damages.\u2019 (Citations omitted.) <em>Miles v. Perpetual Savings &amp; Loan Co. </em>(1979), 58 Ohio St.2d 93, 95 [388 N.E.2d 1364].\u201d <em>State Farm, </em>2006-Ohio-3967, 2006 WL 2171568, \u00b6 32-34.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">{\u00b6 121} Finally, \u201ca fiduciary can assume a duty that is \u2018created by his undertaking, to act primarily for the benefit of another in matters connected with his undertaking.\u2019 <em>Nilavar v. Osborn </em>(1998), 127 Ohio App.3d 1, 20 [711 N.E.2d 726], quoting <em>Strock v. Pressnell </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 207, 216 [527 N.E.2d 1235].\u201d <em>State Farm </em>at \u00b6 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">{\u00b6 122} Having considered the extensive fiduciary duties imposed upon real estate agents by R.C. 4735.62, as well as those imposed by common law, as set forth in <em>State Farm, </em>and having considered the facts herein, we cannot conclude as a matter of law that Carpenter failed to establish a duty. <em>Nonamaker, Negley </em>and <em>Robnolte </em>address the application of the statute of frauds to agreements that do not involve the transfer of real property and have no application herein. R.C. 4735.01(B) very broadly defines real estate as follows: \u201c \u2018Real estate\u2019 includes leaseholds as well as any and every interest or estate in land situated in this state, whether corporeal or incorporeal, whether freehold or nonfreehold, and the improvements on the land, but does not include cemetery interment rights.\u201d See <em>St. Bernard Self-Storage v. Hamilton Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 365, 2007-Ohio-5249, 875 N.E.2d 85, \u00b6 24. We cannot conclude that Carpenter\u2019s leasehold was beyond the scope of Long\u2019s duties as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">{\u00b6 123} Further, while Jurcenko\u2019s correspondence with Moore confirms that Carpenter engaged an attorney to address preserving her rights to the income, construing the evidence most strongly in favor of Carpenter, we find that Long specifically advised her that he himself would take care of everything and that her interest in the rental income would be protected and recorded. Carpenter\u2019s version of events, if accepted by the trier of fact, would establish the assumption of a duty by Long regarding the protection of Carpenter\u2019s interest, accompanied by the attendant duties of good faith, loyalty, and due care. If Long assumed the duty, which he disputes, his protection of Carpenter\u2019s interest in the rental income was an inherent part of the real estate transaction(s) and within the scope of the agency relation. Accordingly, we cannot conclude that Long and Big Hill are entitled to summary judgment on Carpenter\u2019s negligence claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">{\u00b6 124} Because Long and Big Hill are not entitled to summary judgment on the alternative grounds that they asserted below, we will next address Carpenter\u2019s remaining assignments of error, which we will consider together. They are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>{\u00b6 125} \u201cThe trial court erred as a matter of law by confirming the magistrate\u2019s decision without conducting an independent review of the motion for summary judgment and memorandum in opposition therein and properly applying the requirements of Ohio Civil Rule 56.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">{\u00b6 126} And</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">{\u00b6 127} \u201cThe trial court erred as a matter of law in granting summary judgment by misapplying principles of an action of interpleader and Ohio Civil Rule 22 and thereby preventing this action from proceeding forward.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">{\u00b6 128} And</p>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">{\u00b6 129} \u201cThe trial court erred as a matter of law by not applying the proper principles of mediation and thereby preventing this action from proceeding forward.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b440-9\">{\u00b6 130} Having found that Carpenter\u2019s claims are not barred by res judicata, and having sustained Carpenter\u2019s first assignment of error, analysis of Carpenter\u2019s remaining assignments of error is rendered moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-10\">II. Arthur and Clymer\u2019s Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"AtB\">A. Res Judicata</p>\n<p id=\"b440-11\">{\u00b6 131} Arthur and Clymer\u2019s sole assignment of error is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b440-12\">{\u00b6 132} \u201cThe trial court erred in granting summary judgment to appellees on all claims and finding no dispute of fact raised in the summary judgment pleadings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b440-13\">{\u00b6 133} As discussed above at length in the analysis of Carpenter\u2019s appeal, since the issues of Long\u2019s, Big Hill\u2019s, and Stoneridge\u2019s alleged misfeasance and Arthur\u2019s and Clymer\u2019s resulting damages have not been decided, and since, pursuant to <em>Busch, </em>Long, Big Hill, and Stoneridge are not in privity with Cincinnati Bell Wireless, the trial court erred in rendering summary judgment in favor of the appellees on the basis of res judicata. Having so found, as in Carpenter\u2019s appeal, we must address the alternative grounds for summary judgment. See <em>Snell, </em>Montgomery App. No. 17440. Long, Big Hill, and Stone-ridge asserted below that alternative grounds exist justifying summary judgment in their favor against Arthur and Clymer. We will first address the alternative grounds argued below by Long and Big Hill, and then we will address the alternative grounds argued by Stoneridge.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-14\">B. Long and Big Hill\u2019s Alternative Grounds</p>\n<p id=\"b440-15\">{\u00b6 134} Long and Big Hill asserted that they satisfied their obligations under Ohio law to Arthur and Clymer. Long and Big Hill maintain, \u201cArthur and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>Clymer\u2019s claims fail as a matter of law because there was no obligation to \u2018except\u2019 rental income, [Arthur and Clymer] had actual notice of Carpenter\u2019s right to the rental income and [Arthur and Clymer] did not sustain damages.\u201d We discuss Long and Big Hill\u2019s assertions in the order best suited for analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\">1. Actual Knowledge</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">{\u00b6 135} Long and Big Hill claimed that \u201cArthur is chargeable with notice and is precluded from avoiding the effect of Carpenter\u2019s ownership of the rental income,\u201d relying upon <em>Schloss v. Brown </em>(1920), 13 Ohio App. 294 (\u201cIt is the settled rule in Ohio that a purchaser of land which is in the actual possession of a third party, known to him, is chargeable with notice of any equitable title of the party in possession whatever the same may prove to be\u201d).

Correct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b444-16\">{\u00b6 183} Arthur testified that he \u201ctried asking Cindy Jurcenco, at Cincinnati Bell, anything about the contract, and she wouldn\u2019t divulge anything, other than that Anna Carpenter has an income and wouldn\u2019t tell me the amount or anything.\u201d Arthur stated that at the time of the closing he knew that Cincinnati Bell Wireless owned the cell tower and that Carpenter was receiving the rental income.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-17\">{\u00b6 184} Long and Big Hill directed the trial court\u2019s attention to the following exchange:</p>\n<p id=\"b444-18\">{\u00b6 185} \u201cQ. And once you found that out and you had concerns about whether you were entitled to those rental payments instead, did you ever ask to postpone the closing on the property?</p>\n<p id=\"b444-19\">{\u00b6 186} \u201cA. No, I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b444-20\">{\u00b6 187} Arthur\u2019s affidavit, attached to Arthur and Clymer\u2019s memorandum in opposition to Long and Big Hill\u2019s motion for summary judgment, provides, \u201cMr. Long * * * proceeded to prepare a purchase agreement offer for Chanin and I to sign, which made no exclusion of our right as purchasers to receive the rentals after we owned the property, but instead expressly provided for a pro-ration of rentals to the date of closing.\u201d Arthur averred that Long did not tell him and Clymer that Carpenter would continue to receive the rental income after she sold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>the property to Stoneridge, and he did not advise them of \u201cthe existence of any instruments reserving the rentals or assigning the rentals to Anna Carpenter.\u201d Arthur avers that after the counteroffer was accepted, Long advised Arthur that a release regarding the cell-tower income was being prepared for his signature. According to Arthur\u2019s affidavit, when \u201cno release was presented at the closing, I believed that Stoneridge had realized that it was obligated to honor the terms of the purchase agreement and because the deed did not exclude the cell tower land rentals or otherwise reserve those to Anna Carpenter, I accepted the deed from Stoneridge.\u201d Arthur averred that his mortgage broker, \u201cDeborah Eick, and our title agent, Lynn Thompson, both advised us that they knew of no right that Stoneridge had which would entitle Stoneridge to change the essential terms of our purchase agreement after it had been offered and accepted. They further advised that the Greene County Recorder\u2019s Office had no recorded documents reserving or assigning the cell-tower land rentals to Anna Carpenter, and cautioned us about signing any such release document.\u201d Finally, Arthur avers that at \u201cthe time of our closing on July 14, 2006, I had actual knowledge that Stoneridge had for a time attempted to change the terms of our purchase agreement, but I had no actual knowledge of the existence of an Assignment instrument, whereby Stoneridge had previously assigned the rentals back to Anna Carpenter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">{\u00b6 188} In her deposition, Clymer\u2019s testimony was consistent with Arthur\u2019s that Long told her, when she inquired about the cell tower, that \u201che just said Anna had those rights for now.\u201d When asked what she would have done if she learned that she and Arthur were not entitled to the cell-tower income, Clymer replied, \u201cProbably wouldn\u2019t have had my name on the deed because I wouldn\u2019t have gone through with it probably.\u201d Clymer stated that she believed the rights to the cell-tower income passed from Carpenter to Stoneridge to her and Arthur, and \u201cit was more like it ran with the land from what I was investigating, the landowner would be in rights of that.\u201d Clymer further averred, in \u201cthe counter offer by Stoneridge signed June 6th, 2006, there was no proposed change to the purchase agreement regarding the cell tower land rentals, but our purchase of the property was made contingent on Stoneridge\u2019s purchase of the property from Anna Carpenter as Stoneridge had not yet closed on its purchase from Anna Carpenter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">{\u00b6 189} In his deposition, Long testified that Arthur and Clymer \u201cwere made aware that there was a document being prepared that would divide the proceeds from the cell tower, that Mrs. Carpenter would retain the income from the cell tower and that the cell tower would remain standing. And he would receive no proceeds from that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">{\u00b6 190} The following exchange then occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>{\u00b6 191} \u201cQ. And who made them aware?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-5\">{\u00b6 192} \u201cA. I made that statement on four occasions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-6\">{\u00b6 193} \u201cQ. That there would be a writing; is that what you\u2019re saying?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-7\">{\u00b6 194} \u201cA. That \u2014 yes, something would be forthcoming that would clearly define the relationship to the cell tower.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-8\">{\u00b6 195} \u201cQ. Was that ever presented to Arthur and Clymer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-9\">{\u00b6 196} \u201cA. Not to my knowledge.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-10\">{\u00b6 197} Long testified that he did not attend the closing of the sale between Stoneridge and Arthur and Clymer, nor did a representative of his office. According to Long, \u201cthe closing was rushed\u201d at Arthur\u2019s request to preserve an interest rate on his loan, and it \u201chappened after hours.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b446-11\">{\u00b6 198} Having reviewed the above evidence, we conclude that a genuine issue of material fact exists regarding whether Arthur and Clymer had actual knowledge that the rights to the rental income were to remain with Carpenter. The contract provided for the proration of rentals, and the cell-tower income was the only rental income from the property. While Long avers that he specifically told Arthur that he and Clymer were not entitled to the rental income, Arthur\u2019s testimony is consistent with Clymer\u2019s that Long stated that Carpenter was receiving the income \u201cfor now,\u201d at a time when she still owned the property. While Arthur and Clymer were advised that a release was being prepared for their signature, suggesting to them that such a document was required to sever the interest in the income from the property, one was not executed prior to or at closing. Arthur and Clymer proceeded to closing, and they argue that in the absence of a release, they believed that the right to the income was theirs. Long did not aver that he made Arthur and Clymer aware of the assignment of future rents between Stoneridge and Carpenter. Clymer testified that she would not have gone through with the sale in the absence of the income, and Long\u2019s testimony is inconsistent, in that he stated that he would have closed regardless of the income, and later that he would have reevaluated the transaction if presented with a release. Because a genuine issue of material fact exists regarding Arthur\u2019s and Clymer\u2019s actual knowledge, Long and Big Hill are not entitled to summary judgment on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-12\">{\u00b6 199} Lastly, Long and Big Hill\u2019s reliance below upon <em>Schloss v. Brown, </em>13 Ohio App. 294, is misplaced. Schloss had been a tenant on property that was later sold. After the sale, Schloss filed an action for specific performance to enforce his rights as a tenant. <em>Schloss </em>involved the rights of the tenant in possession, and not, as here, the rights of the purported successor lessor.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>2. Duty</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">{\u00b6 200} In their complaint, Arthur and Clymer asserted that Long and Big Hill had \u201cbreached their agency duties to [them] as dual agent, failing to except the cell tower rentals from the written purchase agreement and failing to except the cell tower rentals from the warranty deed delivered by said defendants to the closing agent on or about July 14, 2006.\u201d Additionally, they asserted that Long and Big Hill breached their duties to exercise ordinary care to protect their interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">{\u00b6 201} In their motion for summary judgment, Long and Big Hill asserted, again, that the contract to purchase real estate \u201cconcerned the transfer of real property, not personal property.\u201d According to Long and Big Hill, \u201cArthur/Clymer has no evidence as to how Long breached his duty to Arthur/Clymer regarding \u2018excepting\u2019 the cell tower proceeds or that Long failed to protect Arthur/Clymer\u2019s interests.\u201d Long and Big Hill relied upon the following language in the contract between Stoneridge and Arthur and Clymer: \u201cSeller shall furnish a transferable and recordable general warranty deed conveying to purchaser * * * a marketable title to the Property * * * free and clear of all liens, rights to and encumbrances whatsoever, except * * * (d) rights of tenants in possession which would not prevent Purchaser from using the Property for the following purpose: residential.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Finally, Long and Big Hill argued, \u201c[I]t is undisputed that the contract to purchase did not contemplate the transfer of monthly rental income to Arthur/Clymer. Therefore, reasonable minds can only conclude that neither Long nor Big Hill had an obligation to specifically \u2018except\u2019 the rental income from the July 2006 sale.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">{\u00b6 202} Long and Big Hill directed the trial court\u2019s attention to the following exchange:</p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">{\u00b6 203} \u201cQ. The allegations you made against George Long is that he breached his duty to you to except the cell tower proceeds from the purchase contract. How did he breach his duty to you, his agency duty to you?</p>\n<p id=\"b447-9\">{\u00b6 204} \u201cA. Gosh, I wouldn\u2019t know how to answer that question.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-10\">{\u00b6 205} \u201cQ. You saw the purchase contract before he submitted it to the seller, right?</p>\n<p id=\"b447-11\">{\u00b6 206} \u201cA. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-12\">{\u00b6 207} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b447-13\">{\u00b6 208} \u201cQ. All right. Are you saying that he should have included on there that the cell tower proceeds were not included in your purchase?</p>\n<p id=\"b447-14\">{\u00b6 209} \u201cA. Everyone\u2019s opinion to me was that if it was on that contract, then the rights of that income from the cell tower goes with the real estate purchase. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>And so if that\u2019s the law, and, in view of that, then I would have to answer that, yes, he should have written that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">{\u00b6 210} In their memorandum in opposition to Long and Big Hill\u2019s motion for summary judgment, Arthur and Clymer relied upon section 6 of the contract to purchase real estate between them and Stoneridge, which provides in part for the proration of \u201crentals.\u201d Arthur and Clymer asserted that Long and Big Hill \u201cmay have in error believed that their status as dual agents nullified any affirmative duty to speak to the buyers. Even was [sic] that the case, the retention of the rental prorations clause as part of the purchase agreement prepared by George Long went well beyond mere silence for which the realtors are clearly answerable.\u201d Attached to their memorandum in opposition is the affidavit of Lynne Compton, the owner of Summit Land Title, confirming Arthur\u2019s testimony that she \u201ccautioned\u201d Arthur against releasing his rights to the income, because there was no interest in the income of record.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">{\u00b6 211} We initially conclude, for the reasons discussed in Carpenter\u2019s appeal, that the rental income is not outside the scope of the real estate transaction. The record reflects that Arthur, Clymer, and Stoneridge signed an agency disclosure statement, thereby consenting to Long\u2019s dual representation of the interests of the buyers and seller in the transaction. As noted in Carpenter\u2019s appeal, as a real estate agent, Long owed extensive fiduciary duties to Arthur and Clymer. Construing the evidence most strongly in favor of Arthur and Clymer, we note that Long advised them that Carpenter was receiving the rental income \u201cfor now,\u201d at a time when Carpenter still owned the property; the closing of the sale between Stoneridge and Arthur and Clymer was contingent upon the closing of the sale between Carpenter and Stoneridge. Long advised Arthur that a release of their rights to the rental income was being prepared for his and Clymer\u2019s signatures, thereby implying to them that the rights to the rental income, in the absence of such a release, would belong to them as successor lessors. The contract provided that Cincinnati Bell Wireless had a right to maintain its cell tower on the property, as a tenant in possession, but the contract also expressly provided for the proration of rentals at closing. Because the contract expressly provided for the proration of rentals, and because Arthur and Clymer were unaware of the assignment of rents, we cannot say as a matter of law that Long did not breach his duties to Arthur and Clymer when he failed to affirmatively exclude the rental income from the transaction. Accordingly, Long and Big Hill are not entitled to summary judgment on this alternative basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">3. Estoppel</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">{\u00b6 212} Long and Big Hill argued, without elaboration, that the \u201ccell tower income was not an important part of the sale,\u201d and that \u201cbefore Arthur signed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>contract, he had no problems with how it was written up. Accordingly, estoppel principles preclude Arthur/Clymer\u2019s objections to how the sale occurred.\u201d Long and Big Hill seem to argue that Arthur and Clymer, in accepting the contract as written, without a provision specifically granting them an interest in the cell-tower income, waived the right to challenge the contract. Since the purchase contract provided for the proration of rental income, we find that this argument lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">4. Damages</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">{\u00b6 213} In their complaint, Arthur and Clymer asserted that they \u201cwere damaged to the extent of the cell tower rentals assigned to Arthur and Clymer under the terms of the Interpleader settlement and to the extent of the attorney fees and costs incurred by Arthur and Clymer in defending that action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">{\u00b6 214} In their motion for summary judgment, Long and Big Hill asserted below that it \u201cis undisputed that had Long and Big Hill done what Arthur/Clymer allege they were required to do, Arthur/Clymer would be entitled to nothing, i.e., Arthur/Clymer is in a better position because of the alleged breach than had it not occurred.\u201d This argument is flawed. Clymer\u2019s testimony establishes that she would have refused to sign a release had one been presented to her: \u201cI don\u2019t feel it would have been a good investment. We wouldn\u2019t have gotten anything in return, and I have the noise of the cell tower, the traffic in and out on the cell tower.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">{\u00b6 215} Having determined that Long and Big Hill are not entitled to summary judgment on Arthur and Clymer\u2019s claims, we cannot conclude that Arthur and Clymer did not sustain damages as a result of Long\u2019s conduct. There is a genuine issue as to whether Arthur and Clymer were damaged to the full extent of the rental income. Accordingly, Long and Big Hill are not entitled to summary judgment on this basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-9\">{\u00b6 216} Having found that Arthur and Clymer\u2019s claims are not barred by res judicata, and having concluded that Long and Big Hill are not entitled to summary judgment on any alternative grounds, we hold that it was error for the court to grant summary judgment against Arthur and Clymer.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-10\">C. Stoneridge\u2019s Alternative Grounds</p>\n<p id=\"b449-11\">{\u00b6 217} Against Stoneridge, Arthur and Clymer asserted in their complaint that Stoneridge contracted with Carpenter to allow her to retain the cell-tower rental income but Stoneridge failed to except that right to receive the income from the purchase agreement or from the warranty deed given to Arthur and Clymer.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>{\u00b6 218} In their motion for summary judgment, Stoneridge asserted that it had no right to sell or transfer the cell-tower rental income, which belonged to Carpenter. According to Stoneridge, allegations that Stoneridge promised the cell-tower income to Arthur and Clymer, or misrepresented terms relating to the income, or fraudulently induced Arthur and Clymer to agree to the contract are absent from their complaint. Stoneridge asserted that it \u201ccomplied with all terms negotiated in the Contract and did not breach its agreement\u201d with Arthur and Clymer, and that because Arthur and Clymer agreed to the terms of the contract, and were silent after its execution, they are \u201cequitably estopped from now taking a contrary position to the prejudice of Stoneridge.\u201d Stoneridge also asserted that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law because Arthur and Clymer had actual notice of the cell-tower lease, such that the omission of the cell-tower lease from the deed is irrelevant. Stoneridge relied in part upon <em>Schloss v. Brown, </em>13 Ohio App. 294. Stoneridge asserted that Arthur and Clymer suffered no damages. Finally, Stoneridge asserted that Carpenter owned the rights to the rental income, and Stoneridge \u201ccannot contract for, give away, or \u2018except\u2019 anything it does not own.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">{\u00b6 219} In their memorandum opposing Stoneridge\u2019s motion for summary judgment, Arthur and Clymer asserted that the contract expressly provided for the proration of rentals, and they asserted that they, and not Stoneridge, were entitled to the protection of equitable estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">1. Breach of Contract</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">{\u00b6 220} \u201cGenerally, a plaintiff must present evidence on several elements to successfully prosecute a breach of contract claim. Those elements include the existence of a contract, performance by the plaintiff, breach by the defendant, and damage or loss to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Doner v. Snapp </em>(1994), 98 Ohio App.3d 597, 600, 649 N.E.2d 42.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">{\u00b6 221} \u201c \u201cWhen the language of a written agreement is clear, a court may look no further than the writing itself to find the intent of the parties.\u2019 \u201d <em>Outback/Buckeye-II Ltd. Partnership v. Lofino Grandchildren\u2019s Trust, </em>Greene App. Nos. 06-CA-2 and 06-CA-44, 2007-Ohio-577, 2007 WL 431479, \u00b6 53.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-9\">{\u00b6 222} Stoneridge\u2019s position is that it did not transfer the rental income to Arthur and Clymer by means of the contract. The contract to purchase expressly provides for the proration of rental income, and it does not expressly exclude the cell-tower rental income. Construing the evidence most strongly in favor of Arthur and Clymer, we cannot conclude as a matter of law that Stoneridge is not in breach of its contract with Arthur and Clymer such that Arthur and Clymer suffered no damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>2. Breach of Warranty</p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\">{\u00b6 223} According to Stoneridge, Arthur and Clymer\u2019s breach of warranty claim is barred by Arthur and Clymer\u2019s actual knowledge that Carpenter retained the rights to the rental income, in reliance upon <em>Schloss v. Brown, </em>13 Ohio App. 294, and Stoneridge further asserts that constructive notice can bind a purchaser to an unrecorded encumbrance, in reliance upon <em>Four Howards, Ltd. v. J &amp; F Wenz Road Invest., L.L.C., </em>179 Ohio App.3d 399, 2008-Ohio-6174, 902 N.E.2d 63.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">{\u00b6 224} The survivorship deed attached to Arthur and Clymer\u2019s complaint covenants the property at issue \u201csubject to taxes and assessments which are now or may hereafter become liens on said premises and except conditions and restrictions and easements, if any, contained in former deeds of record for said premises, subject to all of which this conveyance is made.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">{\u00b6 225} As determined in Carpenter\u2019s appeal, the contract to purchase did not except the rental income but rather expressly provided for the proration of rental income. When Long did not provide the release at closing, according to Arthur\u2019s affidavit, Arthur \u201cbelieved that Stoneridge had realized that it was obligated to honor the terms of the purchase agreement and because the deed did not exclude the cell tower land rentals or otherwise reserve those to [Carpenter], I accepted the deed from Stoneridge.\u201d Arthur and Clymer were told by the title agent that there were no interests of record encumbering the property. Arthur and Clymer were unaware of the existence of the unrecorded assignment instruments. Stoneridge had no contact with Arthur and Clymer in the course of the transaction. Accordingly, we cannot conclude that Arthur and Clymer had actual knowledge of Carpenter\u2019s purported interest in the rental income, and Stoneridge is not entitled to summary judgment on this basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">3. Estoppel</p>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">{\u00b6 226} According to Stoneridge, by signing the contract, Arthur and Clymer represented that they approved of and accepted its terms, despite the lack of terms related specifically to cell-tower income; they misled Stoneridge by rushing to complete the sale with the intent to later initiate litigation to attempt to wrongly gain the rental income; and Stoneridge relied upon Arthur and Clymer\u2019s acceptance of the contract terms by completing the transaction and transferring the property to Arthur and Clymer to their detriment.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-9\">{\u00b6 227} \u201cEquitable estoppel precludes a party from asserting certain facts where the party, by his conduct, has induced another to change his position in good-faith reliance upon that conduct. * * * The purpose of equitable estoppel is to prevent actual or constructive fraud and to promote the ends of justice. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>{\u00b6 228} \u201c \u2018A prima facie case for equitable estoppel requires a plaintiff to prove four elements: (1) that the defendant made a factual misrepresentation; (2) that it is misleading; (3) [that it induced] actual reliance which is reasonable and in good faith; and (4) [that the reliance caused] detriment to the relying party.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hutchinson v. Wenzke </em>(1999), 131 Ohio App.3d 613, 616, 723 N.E.2d 176, quoting <em>Doe v. Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Ohio </em>(1992), 79 Ohio App.3d 369, 379, 607 N.E.2d 492.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">{\u00b6 229} To establish that Arthur and Clymer \u201cmisled all defendants,\u201d Stone-ridge directed the trial court\u2019s attention to the following testimony by Arthur:</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">{\u00b6 230} \u201cQ. * * * Have you ever had any communications with Bob Abernathy about this property?</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">{\u00b6 231} \u201cA. No.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">{\u00b6 232} \u201cQ. Do you know if Chanin has?</p>\n<p id=\"b452-9\">{\u00b6 233} \u201cA. Yes, I know she has not. He stated that he did to Cindy Jurcenco.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-10\">{\u00b6 234} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b452-11\">{\u00b6 235} \u201cQ. Have you ever had any conversations with anybody associated with Stoneridge Development?</p>\n<p id=\"b452-12\">{\u00b6 236} \u201cA. Correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-13\">{\u00b6 237} \u201cQ. The answer is that you have not had any communications?</p>\n<p id=\"b452-14\">{\u00b6 238} \u201cA. That I recall.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-15\">{\u00b6 239} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b452-16\">{\u00b6 240} \u201cQ. All right. You mentioned that you had some conversations with a woman with Cincinnati Bell. Do you recall that testimony?</p>\n<p id=\"b452-17\">{\u00b6 241} \u201cA. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-18\">{\u00b6 242} \u201cQ. When did that conversation take place?</p>\n<p id=\"b452-19\">{\u00b6 243} \u201cA. I can only \u2014 it\u2019s vague recollections of the days following the purchase contract and trying to find out something about cell tower leases.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-20\">{\u00b6 244} \u201cQ. So this conversation with \u2014 what was the name of this woman?</p>\n<p id=\"b452-21\">{\u00b6 245} \u201cA. Cindy Jurcenco.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-22\">{\u00b6 246} \u201cQ. So this conversation with Cindy Jurcenco would have been prior to the closing of the property?</p>\n<p id=\"b452-23\">{\u00b6 247} \u201cA. Yes, it was.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-24\">{\u00b6 248} \u201cQ. And at that time, you knew that those cell phone towers were owned by Cincinnati Bell, correct?</p>\n<p id=\"b452-25\">{\u00b6 249} \u201cA. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>{\u00b6 250} \u201cQ. So you had no understanding or belief that Anna Carpenter actually owned those towers?</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">{\u00b6 251} \u201cA. Oh, correct. I didn\u2019t know that. I knew she owned the property that it was on.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">{\u00b6 252} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">{\u00b6 253} \u201cQ. Well, when you called and talked to the representative from Cincinnati Bell, it was your understanding at that time that Cincinnati Bell owned those towers\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">{\u00b6 254} \u201cA. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-9\">{\u00b6 255} \u201cQ. \u2014and that Anna Carpenter was getting the rental payments?</p>\n<p id=\"b453-10\">{\u00b6 256} \u201cA. Yes, yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-11\">{\u00b6 257} \u201cQ. So you were aware at that time that Anna Carpenter was getting the rental payments from Cincinnati Bell?</p>\n<p id=\"b453-12\">{\u00b6 258} \u201cA. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-13\">{\u00b6 259} \u201cQ. And once you found that out and you had concerns about whether you were entitled to those rental payments instead, did you ever ask to postpone the closing on the property?</p>\n<p id=\"b453-14\">{\u00b6 260} \u201cA. No, I didn\u2019t.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-15\">{\u00b6 261} \u201cQ. And that was a decision that you made?</p>\n<p id=\"b453-16\">{\u00b6 262} \u201cA. Yes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b453-17\">{\u00b6 263} Even if we were to conclude that Stoneridge, who had no contact with Arthur and Clymer at any time, established that Arthur and Clymer had made a factual misrepresentation that was misleading when it accepted Stoneridge\u2019s counteroffer, Stoneridge is not entitled to the protection of equitable estoppel because it cannot establish that it reasonably relied, in good faith, on Arthur and Clymer\u2019s alleged representation that the rental income was not a material part of the transaction. The following exchange occurred in the deposition of Robert Abernathy, agent for Stoneridge:</p>\n<p id=\"b453-18\">{\u00b6 264} \u201cQ. * * * Now, in your transaction with Anna Carpenter, you have committed with her that she could retain cell tower rentals upon your purchase from her of her land including this five acres; is that correct?</p>\n<p id=\"b453-19\">{\u00b6 265} \u201cA. Yes, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-20\">{\u00b6 266} \u201cQ. And do I take it it was your intention that the sale agreement with Mr. Arthur and Mrs. Clymer would exempt out, except from the transaction, those rentals?</p>\n<p id=\"b453-21\">{\u00b6 267} \u201cA. Yes, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>{\u00b6 268} \u201cQ. Could you explain why * * * the contract to purchase fails to make that exemption, that exception for the cell tower rentals?</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">{\u00b6 269} \u201cA. No, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">{\u00b6 270} Abernathy then testified that Long assured him that he had informed Arthur and Clymer that Carpenter retained the right to the income. The following exchange occurred:</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">{\u00b6 271} \u201cQ. Did [Long] provide you any documentation, any writings that verified \u2014 documented that fact?</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">{\u00b6 272} \u201cA. No, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-9\">{\u00b6 273} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b454-10\">{\u00b6 274} \u201cQ. If that was a concern prior to and at the time of signing the contract to purchase, why is it then that you didn\u2019t look specifically to see in the contract with Arthur and Clymer that the rentals had been carved out?</p>\n<p id=\"b454-11\">{\u00b6 275} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b454-12\">{\u00b6 276} \u201cA. In hindsight that probably should have been done, but I find it impossible to believe that somebody can\u2019t see a cell tower and know they didn\u2019t sign anything or have anything and they were notified that they weren\u2019t going to get the cell tower income, that anybody would even try to do something so despicable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b454-13\">{\u00b6 277} The contract to purchase provides for the proration of rental income, and Abernathy, in his employment with Stoneridge, undoubtedly has extensive experience with real estate contracts and the provisions they contain. Abernathy intended that the purchase contract exclude the rental income from the transaction. He included in the contract an addendum that conditioned the Arthur and Clymer closing on the closing of the Carpenter and Stoneridge transaction, but he did not except the rental income. Abernathy executed the assignment-of-rent payments with Carpenter but did not provide the- document to Arthur and Clymer prior to or at closing, and the document was not recorded. Abernathy had no documentation that Long adequately protected Carpenter\u2019s interest, such as a release of their rights to the income. Abernathy admits that he should have verified that the rentals were excepted from the contract. Accordingly, Stone-ridge cannot establish that it reasonably and in good faith proceeded to closing in reliance upon any alleged representation by Arthur and Clymer that, by accepting the contract terms, they were not entitled to the rental income. Even if we believed that Arthur and Clymer knew that they were not entitled to the rental income, the existence of the rental provision in the contract renders Stoneridge\u2019s reliance upon the alleged misrepresentation unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>{\u00b6 278} Having determined that Arthur and Clymer\u2019s claims against Stone-ridge are not barred by the doctrine of res judicata, and having found that Stoneridge is not entitled to summary judgment on the alternative bases asserted by it, we hold that -it was error for the trial court to grant summary judgment in favor of Stoneridge. In so holding, we note that the trial court\u2019s decision granting summary judgment in favor of Long and Big Hill on Stoneridge\u2019s cross-claim for indemnity against Long and Big Hill is also error.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">{\u00b6 279} Having found error in the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to all defendants, the trial court\u2019s judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b455-7\">Hall, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b455-8\">Fain, J., concurs separately.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b424-9\">. <em>McCrory </em>involved a tort claim for medical malpractice filed initially in the Ohio Court of Claims against the state, the Ohio Youth Commission, and a doctor who was later voluntarily dismissed. The McCrorys prevailed against the state and the youth commission, and the case was refiled against the doctor in a common pleas court, which partially granted the doctor's summary judgment motion on the basis of collateral estoppel, to preclude relitigation of two issues relating to proximate cause, although the malpractice claim itself was not barred.

Conversely, Carpenter thought that she was retaining that rental income. In each case, the issue of whether Carpenter, or Arthur and Clymer, would emerge from the transaction with the rental income is different from the issue of whether Carpenter, or Arthur and Clymer, failed to emerge from the transaction with the rental income as a result <em>of </em>the negligence of some or all of the defendants. In other words, the essence of the cause of action of each plaintiff against each defendant is: \u201cI did not come away from the transaction with the rental income, and the reason I didn\u2019t is due to your negligence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b455-13\">{\u00b6 283} The issue in each plaintiffs cause of action is not the same as the issue between the two plaintiffs: which plaintiff \u2014 Carpenter or Arthur and Clymer \u2014 is entitled to the rental income. In fact, as to each plaintiff, that plaintiffs failure to have obtained all the rental income in the transaction between them, far from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>precluding their cause of action against their respective defendants, is an essential element of that cause of action. Carpenter, for example, would have no cause of action against the defendants in her lawsuit if she had, in fact, retained the rights to the rental income in her transaction with Arthur and Clymer. Conversely, Arthur and Clymer would have no cause of action against the defendants in their lawsuit if they had, in fact, obtained the rights to the rental income in their transaction with Carpenter.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">{\u00b6 284} The issue in each plaintiffs cause of action is different from the issue that was settled between the two plaintiffs. Therefore, collateral estoppel does not bar their claims against their respective defendants.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
