Compare <em>Young v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Mental Retardation &amp; Dev. Disabilities, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 95955, 2011-Ohio-2291, 2011 WL 1844188; <em>Wade v. Stewart, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 93405, 2010-Ohio-164, 2010 WL 194475; and <em>Grassia v. Cleveland, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 91013, 2008-Ohio-3134, 2008 WL 2536059, with <em>Fink v. Twentieth Century Homes, Inc., </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 94519, 2010-Ohio-5486, 2010 WL 4520482; and <em>Parsons v. Greater Cleveland Regional Transit </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number><em>Auth., </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 93528, 2010-Ohio-266, 2010 WL 323420. We undertook en banc consideration of this matter sua sponte and convened an en banc conference in accordance with <em>McFadden v. Cleveland State Univ., </em>120 Ohio St.3d 54, 2008-Ohio-4914, 896 N.E.2d 672.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">{\u00b6 2} We find that the trial court\u2019s decision in this matter is a final, appealable order pursuant to the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Hubbell v. Xenia, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 77, 2007-Ohio-4839, 873 N.E.2d 878. Therefore, the panel will determine the merits of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">{\u00b6 3} The city of Cleveland, its police chief, a police sergeant, and two police officers (collectively, the \u201cmunicipal defendants\u201d) appeal from the denial of their motion to dismiss and/or for judgment on the pleadings as to all claims against them. Below, they argued that the complaint\u2019s allegations against them were insufficient and that they were immune from liability under R.C. Chapter 2744. The trial court denied their motion without opinion. The issue before us is whether this ruling is an appealable order.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">{\u00b6 4} \u201cIt is well-established that an order must be final before it can be reviewed by an appellate court. If an order is not final, then an appellate court has no jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Gen. Acc. Ins. Co. v. Ins. Co. of N. Am. </em>(1989), 44 Ohio St.3d 17, 20, 540 N.E.2d 266. Generally, an order denying a motion to dismiss is not a final, appealable order. <em>Polikoff v. Adam </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 100, 103, 616 N.E.2d 213. However, under R.C. 2744.02(C), \u201c[a]n order that denies a political subdivision or an employee of a political subdivision the benefit of an alleged immunity from liability as provided in this chapter or any other provision of the law is a final order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">{\u00b6 5} In <em>Hubbell v. Xenia, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 77, 2007-Ohio-4839, 873 N.E.2d 878, the Ohio Supreme Court held that under R.C. 2744.02(C), a judgment denying a motion for summary judgment in which a political subdivision seeks immunity protection under R.C. Chapter 2744 is a final, appealable order. Although decided in the context of a motion for summary judgment, the <em>Hubbell </em>court made clear that its holding was not limited to motions for summary judgment, stating:</p>\n<p id=\"b613-9\">{\u00b6 6} \u201c[T]he use of the words \u2018benefit\u2019 and \u2018alleged\u2019 illustrates that the scope of this provision is not limited to orders delineating a \u2018final\u2019 denial of immunity. R.C. 2744.02(C) defines as final a denial of the \u2018benefit\u2019 of an \u2018alleged\u2019 immunity, not merely a denial of immunity. Therefore, the plain language of R.C. 2744.02(C) does not require a final denial of immunity before the political subdivision has the right to an interlocutory appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-10\">{\u00b6 7} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>{\u00b6 8} \u201c[W]e hold that when a trial court denies a motion in which a political subdivision or its employee seeks immunity under R.C. Chapter 2744, that order denies the benefit of an alleged immunity and thus is a final, appealable order pursuant to R.C. 2744.02(C).\u201d Id. at \u00b6 12, 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">{\u00b6 9} The <em>Hubbell </em>court explained the policy reasons for its broad interpretation of R.C. 2744.02(C) as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">{\u00b6 10} \u201c \u2018As the General Assembly envisioned, the determination of immunity [should] be made prior to investing the time, effort, and expense of the courts, attorneys, parties, and witnesses * * \u201d Id. at \u00b6 26, quoting <em>Burger v. Cleveland Hts. </em>(1999), 87 Ohio St.3d 188, 199-200, 718 N.E.2d 912.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-8\">{\u00b6 11} Since <em>Hubbell </em>was decided, this court and others have repeatedly held that a trial court\u2019s judgment denying a motion for judgment on the pleadings or motion to dismiss when a political subdivision has asserted immunity is a final, appealable order. See, e.g., <em>Rucker v. Newburgh Hts., </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 89487, 2008-Ohio-910, 2008 WL 597603 (judgment denying city\u2019s Civ.R. 12(C) motion for judgment on the pleadings was a final, appealable order pursuant to Hubbell); <em>Pearson v. Warrensville Hts. City Schools, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 88527, 2008-Ohio-1102, 2008 WL 660856 (judgment denying municipal schools\u2019 motion for judgment on the pleadings was a final, appealable order pursuant to <em>Hubbell); Stevenson v. ABM, </em>Medina App. No. 07CA0009-M, 2008-Ohio-3214, 2008 WL 2582990 (noting that Ohio Supreme Court reversed appellate court\u2019s dismissal of an appeal for lack of a final, appealable order on the authority of <em>Hubbell </em>and remanded for appellate court to conduct de novo review of trial court\u2019s denial of municipality\u2019s Civ.R. 12(B)(6) motion for judgment on the pleadings based on sovereign immunity); <em>Slonsky v. J.W. Didado Elec., Inc., </em>Summit App. No. 24228, 2008-Ohio-6791, 2008 WL 5340863 (holding, on authority of <em>Hubbell, </em>that trial court erred in finding that defense of sovereign immunity cannot be raised in a motion to dismiss); <em>Parsons v. Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Autk, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 93523, 2010-Ohio-266, 2010 WL 323420 (trial court\u2019s judgment denying public transit authority\u2019s Civ.R. 12(B)(6) motion to dismiss because of statutory immunity was a final, appealable order pursuant to <em>Hubbell); Fink v. Twentieth Century Homes, Inc., </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 94519, 2010-Ohio-5486, 2010 WL 4520482 (trial court\u2019s judgment denying city\u2019s Civ.R. 12(B)(6) motion to dismiss was a final, appealable order on the authority of <em>Hubbell); Summerville v. Forest Park, </em>128 Ohio St.3d 221, 2010-Ohio-6280, 943 N.E.2d 522 (citing with approval <em>Paul C. Harger Trust v. Morrow Cty. Regional Planning Comm., </em>Morrow App. No. 03-CA-19, 2004-Ohio-6643, 2004 WL 2847797, which held that trial court\u2019s denial of municipal defendant\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings was final and appealable pursuant to R.C. 2744.02(C)).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>{\u00b6 12} Appellees argue, in reliance on <em>State Auto. Mut. Ins. Co. v. Titanium Metals Corp., </em>108 Ohio St.3d 540, 2006-Ohio-1713, 844 N.E.2d 1199, that the trial court\u2019s judgment in this case is not a final, appealable order because the trial court denied the motion to dismiss without opinion and offered no explanation for its decision. In <em>Titanium Metals, </em>the Ohio Supreme Court considered an appeal in which the trial court denied a motion to dismiss based on immunity without opinion. The Supreme Court found there was no final, appealable order because the trial court had not provided an explanation for its decision. The court reasoned that the trial court had \u201cmade no determination as to whether immunity applied, [or] whether there was an exception to immunity\u201d and hence had not disposed of the case. Id. at \u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">{\u00b6 13} This court adopted the reasoning of <em>Titanium Metals </em>in <em>Grassia, </em>2008-Ohio-3134, 2008 WL 2536059, and dismissed the city\u2019s appeal of the trial court\u2019s denial of its Civ.R. 12(B)(6) motion for judgment on the pleadings for lack of a final, appealable order, because the trial court denied the motion without explanation. See also <em>Vaughn v. Cleveland Mun. School Dist., </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 86848, 2006-Ohio-2572, 2006 WL 1428913 (holding that <em>Titanium Metals </em>compelled dismissal of trial court\u2019s order denying motion for summary judgment that asserted political immunity because trial court denied motion without explanation or opinion).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">{\u00b6 14} But, as the dissent in <em>Hubbell </em>makes clear, the Ohio Supreme Court \u201cdistance[d] itself\u2019 from <em>Titanium Metals </em>in <em>Hubbell </em>and held that \u201c[d]enials of Civ.R. 12(B)(6) motions and motions for a directed verdict, as well as denials of multiple motions for summary judgment, can now be immediately appealed * * Id. at \u00b6 33, 39 (Pfeifer, J., dissenting). And since <em>Grassia, </em>this court has recognized that trial court orders denying motions to dismiss asserting immunity, even where the court has not offered an explanation for its decision, are final, appealable orders under the authority of <em>Hubbell. </em>See, e.g., <em>Parsons, </em>2010-Ohio-266, 2010 WL 323420, at \u00b6 5; <em>Wade, </em>2010-Ohio-164, 2010 WL 194475, at \u00b6 21 (S. Gallagher, J., concurring in judgment only) (\u201c[T]he denial of a motion to dismiss does constitute a final, appealable order under R.C. 2744.02(C)\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">{\u00b6 15} Recently, in <em>Young, </em>2011-Ohio-2291, 2011 WL 1844188, also cited by appellees, this court dismissed an appeal of a trial court\u2019s judgment denying a governmental entity\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings asserting immunity. Relying on <em>Titanium Metals, </em>this court held that the appeal was not final because the trial court did not set forth the reasons for its decision in its journal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>entry. The Ohio Supreme Court declined jurisdiction to hear the governmental entity\u2019s appeal. <em>Young v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Mental Retardation &amp; Dev. Disabilities, </em>129 Ohio St.3d 1504, 2011-Ohio-5358, 955 N.E.2d 386. Nevertheless, the en banc court is convinced, on the authority of <em>Hubbell </em>and cases cited above, that the denial of a motion to dismiss is a final, appealable order under R.C. 2744.02(C), even when the trial court does not explain the reasons for its decision. Accordingly, we overrule <em>Young, Wade, </em>and <em>Grassia </em>and hold that the trial court\u2019s order denying the municipal defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss is a final, appealable order under R.C. 2744.02(C), even if the order does not explain the basis for the court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">{\u00b6 16} Our en banc proceeding was prompted only by the question whether the trial court\u2019s order was final and appealable. Consequently, we will not address the other issues in this case en banc, but leave those issues to the merit panel\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b616-7\">Kilbane, A.J., and Blackmon, Celebrezze, E. Gallagher, S. Gallagher, Jones, Rocco, Stewart and Sweeney, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b616-9\">Cooney, J., concurs in part and dissents in part with separate opinion.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b616-10\">Boyle, J., concurs with the separate opinion of Judge Cooney.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b615-8\">. Appellees\u2019 reliance on <em>Wade </em>is misplaced. In <em>Wade, </em>the court specifically found that R.C. 2744.02(C) did not apply as the alleged injuries occurred between 2001 and 2002, prior to the effective date of the statute. Id., 2010-Ohio-164, 2010 WL 194475, at \u00b6 7.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b616-11\">Colleen Conway Cooney, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A9o\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-12\">{\u00b6 17} I concur in the overruling of <em>Young v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Mental Retardation &amp; Dev. Disabilities, </em>129 Ohio St.3d 1504, 2011-Ohio-5358, 955 N.E.2d 386, but dissent from the overruling of <em>Wade v. Stewart, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 93405, 2010-Ohio-164, 2010 WL 194475, and <em>Grassia v. Cleveland, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 93405, 2008-Ohio-3134, 2008 WL 2536059, which I find to be valid pronouncements of the law in their procedural postures at the time they were decided. The majority correctly notes the critical distinction in <em>Wade </em>in footnote 1, i.e., that the injury in <em>Wade </em>predated the effective date of R.C. 2744.02(C). Therefore, reliance on <em>Wade </em>and overruling <em>Wade </em>are misplaced. Moreover, this court denied the opportunity to en banc <em>Wade.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b616-13\">{\u00b6 18} This court noted in <em>Young </em>that the complaint was filed in April 2008 and the motion to dismiss denied in November 2010. Therefore, I would find that the record should have been thoroughly developed in the two years the case was pending. The <em>Hubbell </em>court specifically distinguished <em>Titanium Metals </em>for its procedural posture in which there was no record or opinion. <em>Hubbell </em>at \u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-14\">{\u00b6 19} <em>Grassia </em>involved an intentional-tort claim filed in October 2007. The trial court denied the city\u2019s motion to dismiss in January 2008. Thus, the record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>had not been developed in those few months. We distinguished <em>Hubbell </em>in footnote 1 as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b617-4\">{\u00b6 20} \u201cIn <em>Hubbell v. Xenia, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 77, 2007-Ohio-4839, 873 N.E.2d 878, the Supreme Court held that the denial of a governmental entity\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the issue of sovereign immunity due to the existence of genuine issues of material fact is a final appealable order under R.C. 2744.02(C). Id. at \u00b6 27. The Court noted, however, that its opinion in <em>[Titanium </em>Metals] was distinguishable from <em>Hubbell. </em>Specifically, the court noted the different procedural postures of the cases: <em>[Titanium Metals] </em>was not decided under R.C. 2744.02(C), but \u2018[rjather, relying on traditional concepts, [the Court] held that there was no final, appealable order in the current posture of the case and sent the case back to the trial court.\u2019 Id. at \u00b6 19. In contrast, in <em>Hubbell, </em>\u2018the record contained] evidence upon which the trial court denied the motion for summary judgment, so as to deny Xenia \u201cthe benefit of an alleged immunity from liability.\u201d \u2019 Id. at \u00b6 20, quoting R.C. 2744.02(C).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">{\u00b6 21} In <em>Grassia, </em>we concluded that \u201c[b]ecause the [trial] court denied the City\u2019s motion in this case without elaboration and there is, therefore, <em>no record on the issue of immunity, </em>* * * there is no final appealable order and we must dismiss.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id. at \u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">{\u00b6 22} I have no idea what is the procedural posture presented in <em>DiGiorgio </em>because the en banc opinion makes no mention of whether the record below is developed. Therefore, I agree that <em>Young </em>should be overruled, but not <em>Wade </em>or <em>Grassia, </em>which can be easily distinguished.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
