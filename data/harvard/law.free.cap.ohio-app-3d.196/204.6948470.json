Abdalla, who, at that time, was the owner of appellant, purchased 3.131 acres of land located at 5281 Hamilton-Middletown Road, Liberty Township, Butler County, Ohio, for $125,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">{\u00b6 3} On March 17, 2005, the Liberty Township Zoning Department issued zoning certificate No. Z05-0215 to Samuel Abdalla certifying that his property, which he intended to use as the site for a fireworks retail store named \u201cPrism Fireworks, Etc.,\u201d conformed to \u201cthe applicable provisions of the Liberty Township Zoning Resolution.\u201d At that time, the Liberty Township zoning resolution classified a fireworks retail store as a \u201cpermitted use.\u201d The zoning certificate, while not specifying an expiration date, required Samuel Abdalla to obtain a building permit \u201cprior to commencing work on the proposed improvement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">{\u00b6 4} On April 7, 2005, appellant received a letter from the Ohio Department of Commerce, Division of State Fire Marshal, granting it preliminary authorization for construction for a new fireworks wholesale facility for fireworks wholesale license number 55-10-0002. Final approval, however, was subject to a \u201cgeographic transfer\u201d of the fireworks license.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">{\u00b6 5} On November 14, 2006, over a year after the Butler County building department received a building-permit application, appellant was issued building permit No. 2005-1055 authorizing it to begin construction of the fireworks retail store on the property. Although appellant had surveyed the land, obtained several necessary permits, and created site plans in preparation for development, the building permit expired on November 14, 2007, before any construction on the property had begun. Appellant did not request an extension to its building permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-9\">{\u00b6 6} Throughout this time, Safety 4th Fireworks, Inc., d.b.a. Country Fireworks, Inc., another corporation apparently owned by Samuel Abdalla, who, it should be noted, had died in the interim, was engaged in a lengthy legal battle regarding the geographic transfer of three wholesale fireworks licenses, including fireworks license No. 55-10-002, which, at that time, was held by Quality Fireworks and Novelty. See <em>Ohio Pyro Inc. v. Ohio Dept. of Commerce, Div. of State Fire Marshal, </em>Fayette App. Nos. CA2005-03-009 and CA2005-03-011, 2006-Ohio-1002, 2006 WL 522457, reversed 115 Ohio St.3d 375, 2007-Ohio-5024, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>875 N.E.2d 550, certiorari denied, 552 U.S. 1275, 128 S.Ct. 1652, 170 L.Ed.2d 386. Appellant, who, although it is not particularly clear from the record, was to receive fireworks license No. 55-10-002 following the geographic transfer, was not a party to this litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">{\u00b6 7} On August 7, 2009, the Liberty Township Board of Trustees enacted revisions to the Liberty Township zoning resolution reclassifying a fireworks retail store from a \u201cpermitted use\u201d to a \u201cconditional use.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">{\u00b6 8} On September 9, 2009, the zoning inspector for the Liberty Township zoning department sent a letter to Keith Eckles of Marquee Construction, an apparent agent of appellant, informing him \u201cthat Zoning Certificate Application # Z05-0215 for the construction of a retail/commercial building for retail fireworks sale is no longer in compliance with the Liberty Township Zoning Resolution.\u201d The letter further notified Eckles that if \u201cthe owner\u2019s (sic) wish to continue with the project, a new permit must be obtained that meets the current regulations in the Liberty Township Zoning Resolution that took effect on August 7, 2009.\u201d On October 9, 2009, appellant appealed this decision to the Liberty Township Board of Zoning Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">{\u00b6 9} On January 12, 2010, after holding a hearing on the matter, and upon reviewing the evidence submitted, which included, among other things, a letter from Eric A. Abdalla on Safety 4th Fireworks letterhead claiming that they had spent in excess of $100,000 in to develop the property, the board denied appellant\u2019s appeal. In so holding, the board found that appellant had \u201cfailed to establish a vested, nonconforming use of the property for fireworks retail store purposes, and must now comply with the conditional use standards contained in the current Zoning Resolution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">{\u00b6 10} On February 11, 2010, appellant appealed the board\u2019s decision to the Butler County Court of Common Pleas. After briefing by both parties, and upon holding a hearing on the matter, the common pleas court overruled appellant\u2019s appeal and affirmed the decision of the board. In so holding, the common pleas court found that appellant \u201cdid not demonstrate a substantial nonconforming use for the property and failed to show that it had established a vested right.\u201d The common pleas court also found that appellant failed to establish the board\u2019s decision as \u201c \u2018unconstitutional, illegal, arbitrary, capricious, unreasonable, or unsupported\u2019 as set forth by Oh. Rev.Code \u00a7 2506.04.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">{\u00b6 11} Appellant now appeals from the common pleas court\u2019s decision affirming the board\u2019s decision finding Samuel Abdalla\u2019s zoning certificate invalid in light of the newly enacted revisions to the Liberty Township zoning resolution, raising two assignment of error for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>Assignment of Error No. 1</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cThe trial court erred by upholding the [board\u2019s] decision because it failed to either analyze or apply the correct legal standard for zoning regulation interpretation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">{\u00b6 13} In its first assignment of error, appellant argues that the common pleas court erred by affirming the board\u2019s decision by \u201cdisregarding its] critical argument on the issue of vague and ambiguous zoning regulation interpretation.\u201d We disagree</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">{\u00b6 14} Appeals of administrative-agency decisions are governed by R.C. Chapter 2506. <em>Mansour v. W. Chester Twp. Bd. of Zoning Appeals, </em>Butler App. No. CA2009-03-073, 2009-Ohio-5641, 2009 WL 3415896, \u00b6 6. Pursuant to R.C. 2506.04, in reviewing an administrative appeal, the common pleas court weighs the evidence presented on the whole record and determines whether the administrative order is unconstitutional, illegal, arbitrary, capricious, unreasonable, or unsupported by the preponderance of substantial, reliable, and probative evidence. See <em>Shamrock Materials, Inc. v. Butler Cty. Bd. of Zoning Appeals, </em>Butler App. No. CA2007-07-172, 2008-Ohio-2906, 2008 WL 2404721, \u00b6 9, citing <em>Shields v. Englewood, </em>172 Ohio App.3d 620, 2007-Ohio-3165, 876 N.E.2d 972, \u00b6 28; see also <em>Smith v. Warren Cty. Rural Zoning Bd. of Appeals, </em>Warren App. No. CA2007-05-058, 2008-Ohio-2910, 2008 WL 2404743, \u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">{\u00b6 15} Applying these principles, the common pleas court was not required to address each argument raised on appeal. See <em>Dyke v. Shaker Hts., </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 83010, 2004-Ohio-514, 2004 WL 231792, \u00b6 65. Instead, as noted, in reviewing an administrative appeal, the common pleas court was required merely to weigh the evidence presented on the whole record and determine whether the administrative order was unconstitutional, illegal, arbitrary, capricious, unreasonable, or unsupported by the preponderance of substantial, reliable, and probative evidence. <em>Shamrock Materials </em>at \u00b6 9, citing <em>Shields </em>at \u00b6 28. A review of the record clearly indicates that the common pleas court properly applied this standard in undertaking its review of the board\u2019s decision. Therefore, because the court applied the appropriate legal standard when reviewing the board\u2019s decision, appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">Assignment of Error No. 2</p>\n<p id=\"b244-9\">{\u00b6 16} \u201cThe trial court abused its discretion by failing to find appellant expended significant time, effort and money thus vesting its right to construct and by failing to apply the doctrine of estoppel in equity to appellees\u2019 refusal to recognize the validity of appellant\u2019s unexpired zoning certificate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>{\u00b6 17} In his second assignment of error, appellant argues that the common pleas court erred by affirming the board\u2019s decision by failing to apply the doctrine of estoppel and by failing to find it had a vested right to construct a fireworks retail store on the property.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">{\u00b6 18} Unlike a common pleas court, an appellate court\u2019s review of an administrative appeal is \u201cmore limited in scope,\u201d for it does not weigh the evidence or determine questions of fact. <em>Henley v. Youngstown Bd. of Zoning Appeals </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 142, 147, 735 N.E.2d 433, quoting <em>Kisil v. Sandusky </em>(1984), 12 Ohio St.3d 30, 34, 12 OBR 26, 465 N.E.2d 848; <em>White Castle Sys., Inc. v. </em>W. <em>Chester Twp. Zoning Comm., </em>Butler App. No. CA2007-07-157, 2008-Ohio-2738, 2008 WL 2331393, \u00b6 9. Instead, in reviewing an administrative appeal, this court must affirm the common pleas court\u2019s decision unless it finds, as a matter of law, that the lower court\u2019s decision was not supported by a preponderance of reliable, probative, and substantial evidence. <em>Taylor v. Wayne Twp. Bd. of Trustees, </em>Butler App. No. CA2008-02-032, 2009-Ohio-193, 2009 WL 119848, \u00b6 10, citing <em>Heiney v. Sylvania Twp. Bd. of Zoning Appeals </em>(1998), 126 Ohio App.3d 391, 395-396, 710 N.E.2d 725.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">{\u00b6 19} Appellant initially argues that the doctrine of estoppel precluded the common pleas court from affirming the board\u2019s decision because it was advised by a \u201crepresentative of Liberty Township zoning office\u201d that renewing its building permit was unnecessary since it had a valid zoning certificate. However, as the Ohio Supreme Court previously stated, \u201c[The doctrine] of equitable estoppel * * * [is] inapplicable against a political subdivision when the political subdivision is engaged in a governmental function.\u201d <em>Hortman v. Miamisburg, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 194, 2006-Ohio-4251, 852 N.E.2d 716, \u00b6 25. Such is the case here. See, e.g., <em>W. Chester Twp. Bd. of Trustees v. Speedway Superamerica, L.L.C., </em>Butler App. No. CA2006-05-104, 2007-Ohio-2844, 2007 WL 1662242, \u00b6 71-73 (finding that a zoning resolution was enforceable against business owner even though a township official erroneously approved the owner\u2019s building plan). Therefore, because the doctrine of estoppel is inapplicable here, appellant\u2019s first argument is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">{\u00b6 20} Next, appellant argues that the common pleas court erred by failing to find that appellant had a vested right to build a fireworks retail store on the property. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>{\u00b6 21} \u201cA vested right is the right to initiate or continue the establishment of a use or construction of a structure which, when completed, will be contrary to the restrictions or regulations of a recently enacted zoning ordinance.\u201d Zeigler, Rathkopfs The Law of Zoning and Planning (4th Ed. 2005), Section 70:2. The constitutional protections offered by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Section 16, Article I of the Ohio Constitution \u201callow a person to have a <em>vested right </em>to the future use of real-property even though the contemplated use was not possible at the time of the effective date of a zoning resolution.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) <em>Natl. Lime &amp; Stone Co. v. Blanchard Twp., </em>Hardin App. Nos. 6-04-04 and 6-04-05, 2005-Ohio-5758, 2005 WL 2840493, \u00b6 30; <em>Sellers v. Union Twp. Bd. of Trustees, </em>Licking App. No. 2009 CA 00073, 2010-Ohio-1138, 2010 WL 1045471, \u00b6 50. The Ohio Supreme Court, however, has placed limitations on what can be considered a \u201cvested right.\u201d <em>Jackson Twp. Bd. of Trustees v. Donrey Outdoor Advertising Co. </em>(Sept. 21, 1999), Franklin App. No. 98AP-1326, 1999 WL 731376, *3.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">{\u00b6 22} The first limitation was pronounced by the Ohio Supreme Court in <em>Smith v. Juillerat </em>(1954), 161 Ohio St. 424, 53 O.O. 340, 119 N.E.2d 611. In <em>Juillerat, </em>the Ohio Supreme Court had the occasion to assess whether a property owner who had applied for and obtained a license to strip-mine the property, had entered into leases with nearby property owners, and had drilled a hole on the land for testing purposes had established a nonconforming use prior to the adoption of a zoning ordinance prohibiting such conduct. Id. at 424-425. In its decision finding that the property owner had not established a vested right to strip-mine his property, the Ohio Supreme Court stated the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">{\u00b6 23} \u201cThe rule seems to be that where no substantial nonconforming use has been made of property, even though such use is contemplated, and money has been expended in preliminary work to that end, a property owner has acquired no vested right to such use and is deprived of none by the operation of a valid zoning ordinance denying the right to proceed with his intended use of the property.\u201d Id. at 431.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">{\u00b6 24} The court again limited what can be considered a vested right in <em>Torok v. Jones </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 31, 5 OBR 90, 448 N.E.2d 819. Similar to its holding in <em>Juillerat, </em>the court in <em>Torok </em>held that \u201c[a] property owner fails to acquire a vested right to complete construction and fails to establish a nonconforming use under a township zoning resolution where there has been no substantial change of position, or expenditures, or no significant incurrence of obligations in reliance upon the zoning permit.\u201d Id. at paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">{\u00b6 25} In applying these principles, Ohio courts, including this court, have found it \u201c[unnecessary] for a person to substantially complete a structure in order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>to have a vested right to complete the structure.\u201d <em>Donrey Outdoor Advertising, </em>1999 WL 731376, at *4; <em>Warren Cty. Bd. of Commrs. v. Nextel Communications </em>(Apr. 26, 1999), Warren App. No. CA98-09-115, 1999 WL 247163, at *12-14. In other words, and as this court has previously stated, \u201cthe court\u2019s focus is not solely upon whether the property owner has started actual construction upon the property, but the court must also inquire as to whether the owner has changed his position, expended significant time, effort or money, or incurred significant obligations.\u201d <em>Nextel Communications </em>at *13, citing <em>Torok </em>at paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">{\u00b6 26} In this case, it is undisputed that appellant had yet to begin actual construction of the fireworks retail store before its building permit expired on November 14, 2007, or before the August 7, 2009 amendments to the Liberty Township zoning resolution took effect. In turn, appellant can establish its alleged vested right to build a fireworks retail store only by showing that it had changed its position, expended significant time, effort, or money, or incurred significant obligations. See id., citing <em>Torok </em>at paragraph two of the syllabus. To that end, appellant claims that it spent over $100,000 in \u201cdeveloping [the] property, protecting its state issued fireworks license, and other consultant fees,\u201d as well as making \u201csignificant expenditures for protracted litigation.\u201d The record, however, fails to support such claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">{\u00b6 27} Here, although the record does indicate that there was significant protracted litigation regarding the geographic transfer of three fireworks licenses, appellant, while apparently in line to receive one of the fireworks licenses in dispute, was not a party to the litigation. Furthermore, while the record does contain a letter from Eric Abdalla claiming Safety 4th Fireworks spent in excess of $100,000 developing the property, the record is devoid of any evidence indicating what position, if any, Eric Abdalla holds with appellant, or of any evidence establishing the corporate structure connecting appellant to Safety 4th Fireworks.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In turn, contrary to appellant\u2019s claim otherwise, the only evidence before this court that its actions, as opposed to the actions of a third party, established a vested right, merely indicate that it procured a preliminary authorization for construction from the Ohio Department of Commerce, Division of State Fire Marshall, it received an Ohio EPA permit to install a septic tank, it obtained site development plans from Paul Architectural Group, P.S.C., and it paid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>$2,986.46 to the Butler County building department to secure building permit No. 2005-1055.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">{\u00b6 28} In <em>Nextel Communications, </em>this court found that a property owner had established a vested right to complete a telecommunications tower even though it had not begun actual construction of the tower. In so holding, this court found that the property owner presented evidence demonstrating that it had \u201cengaged in extensive bidding and negotiations\u201d in seeking a firm to construct the tower, in securing the lease to the property, in surveying and preparing the construction site at a cost of $53,223, and in obtaining the necessary permits. Id. at 13-14.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">{\u00b6 29} In this case, however, and as noted above, the extraordinarily sparse record merely indicates that appellant procured preliminary authorization from the Ohio Department of Commerce for the construction, received a permit from the Ohio EPA to install a septic tank, surveyed the property and obtained site plans, and received a building permit after paying $2,986.46 to the Butler County Building Department. Nothing in the record convinces this court that such rudimentary actions establish a change in position, nor does this evidence demonstrate that appellant expended significant time, effort, or money, or incurred significant obligations allowing it to establish a vested right to building a fireworks retail store on the property. Moreover, while the record does refer to protracted litigation regarding the geographic transfer of three fireworks licenses, appellant was not a party to this litigation. Sitting as an idle observer to protracted litigation is insufficient to preserve one\u2019s rights. Therefore, while our holding is issued with some trepidation, because the common pleas court\u2019s decision affirming the board\u2019s decision was supported by a preponderance of reliable, probative, and substantial evidence, we find no error in the lower court\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">{\u00b6 30} Accordingly, appellant\u2019s second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b248-9\">Powell, P.J., and Hutzel, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b242-10\">. Pursuant to Loc.R. 6(A) of the Twelfth District Court of Appeals, we sua sponte remove this case from the accelerated calendar and place it on the regular calendar for purposes of issuing this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b245-8\">. We note that although often applied interchangeably, the doctrine of estoppel and that of vested rights are separate and distinct legal concepts, for the \"defense of estoppel is derived from equity, but the defense of vested rights reflects principles of common and constitutional law.\u201d Heeter, Zoning Estoppel: Application of the Principles of Equitable Estoppel and Vested Rights to Zoning Disputes, 1971 Urban L.Ann. 63, 64-65; Hanes, On Vested Rights to Land Use and Development (1989), 46 Wash. &amp; Lee L.Rev. 373, 379-380. Appellant's claims, therefore, will be addressed separately.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b247-6\">. Appellant also claims that it \"was enjoined by a court and ordered <em>not </em>to transfer its fireworks license to Butler County.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) According to the record before this court, it seems apparent that appellant is confusing itself with Safety 4th Fireworks and Liberty Fireworks, Inc., both of whom were subject to protracted litigation regarding the geographic transfer of their respective fireworks licenses. However, as noted above, appellant was not a party to this litigation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b248-10\">. We note that our holding may have very well been different had the record contained evidence indicating that appellant and Safety 4th Fireworks were, in fact, the same party.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
