Defendant\u2019s conviction, which includes a sentence of five years of community-control sanctions, was entered on defendant\u2019s no-contest plea after the trial court denied her motion to suppress evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-15\">{\u00b6 2} Defendant appealed to this court from her conviction and sentence. She challenges only the trial court\u2019s decision overruling her motion to suppress evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number> {\u00b6 3} When considering a motion to suppress, the trial court assumes the role of the trier of facts and is therefore in the best position to resolve factual questions and evaluate the credibility of the witnesses. <em>State v. Roberts, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 71, 2006-Ohio-3665, 850 N.E.2d 1168. Consequently, an appellate court must accept the trial court\u2019s findings of fact if they are supported by competent, credible evidence. Id. Accepting those facts as true, the appellate court must then independently determine, without deference to the trial court\u2019s conclusion, whether those facts satisfy the applicable legal standard. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">{\u00b6 4} In overruling defendant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence, the trial court made the following findings of fact:</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">{\u00b6 5} \u201cDeputy Walters has worked for the Sheriffs department for six years. His assigned duty is road patrol, assigned to the Harrison Township area. On the day at issue, Deputy Walters was working alone on the 2:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. shift, wearing the uniform of the day and driving a marked cruiser.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">{\u00b6 6} \u201cAt 4:30 p.m., Deputy Walters was in the area of Salem and Falmouth. Deputy Walters personally has made arrests in this area, which he describes as an area high in crime and drug related activity. Deputy Walters observed a red 1994 Olds Cutlass traveling northbound on Salem Avenue. The vehicle made a sudden lane change without signaling. The Cutlass was then tailgating another vehicle. Deputy Walters thought the sudden lane change may have been for the purpose of turning into a business along Salem Avenue. Deputy Walters followed the Cutlass for a quarter of a mile, with the Cutlass not turning off of Salem Avenue.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-8\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cDeputy Walters initiated a traffic stop and approached the vehicle. He asked the driver, Defendant, if any weapons were in the car. Defendant said no. Deputy Walters explained that he routinely asks that question in this particular area.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-9\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cDeputy Walters checked Defendant\u2019s driver\u2019s license status. In doing so, he noted that Defendant had a prior arrest for trafficking in drugs. He also noted that Defendant lived in Greenville, Ohio. Deputy Walters asked Defendant what had brought her to the area. Defendant responded that she was picking up her son from daycare. Indeed, Defendant\u2019s two and a half year old son was in the car with her.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-10\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cAccording to Deputy Walters, during the stop, Defendant appeared overly nervous. Defendant\u2019s hands were shaking. Additionally, Defendant\u2019s rationale for being in the area seemed unreasonable to Deputy Walters, given the distance between the area and Greenville. On the basis of the totality of these circumstances, Deputy Walters asked Defendant for consent to search her vehicle, to which Defendant replied \u2018yea, you search it.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>{\u00b6 10} \u201cDefendant was placed in Deputy Walters\u2019 cruiser for officer safety while he searched Defendant\u2019s car. Defendant was not patted down. Defendant\u2019s son remained in the Olds. Deputy Walters found a cigarette pack in a CD compartment of the vehicle. Inside the cigarette pack, Deputy Walters observed what he believed was heroin.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cWhen Deputy Walters located the heroin, Defendant was placed under arrest. The drugs were sent to the crime lab and Defendant\u2019s car was towed. Defendant received two traffic citations, one for failure to signal the lane change and the other for following too close. Defendant was not advised that she could deny consent to search. Deputy Walters testified that he asked for Defendant\u2019s consent simultaneously with giving Defendant the traffic citations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">First Assignment of Error</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cThe trial court erred to the defendant-appellant\u2019s prejudice when it overruled her motion to suppress because the defendant-appellant was illegally detained when the officers exceeded the scope and purpose of the original traffic stop.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">Second Assignment of Error</p>\n<p id=\"b153-9\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cThe trial court erred to the defendant-appellant\u2019s prejudice when it overruled her motion to suppress because the search of her vehicle was without free and voluntary consent or, alternatively, void pursuant to an unlawful seizure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b153-10\">{\u00b6 14} Defendant does not challenge her initial traffic stop. That stop was lawful because it was based upon probable cause that defendant had committed two violations of the traffic laws that Deputy Walters observed, changing lanes without signaling and following the vehicle ahead too closely. <em>Dayton v. Erickson </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 3, 665 N.E.2d 1091. What defendant does argue in these related assignments of error is that Deputy Walters illegally expanded the scope and duration of the original traffic stop when he asked defendant for consent to search her vehicle while simultaneously returning her driver\u2019s license, registration, and proof of insurance and giving her the completed traffic citation, and that as a result of that illegally continued detention, defendant\u2019s consent to search her vehicle was not voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-11\">{\u00b6 15} In <em>State v. Robinette </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 234, 685 N.E.2d 762 <em>(.Robinette </em>III), the Ohio Supreme Court stated in the syllabus:</p>\n<p id=\"b153-12\">{\u00b6 16} \u201c1. When a police officer\u2019s objective justification to continue detention of a person stopped for a traffic violation for the purpose of searching the person\u2019s vehicle is not related to the purpose of the original stop, and when that continued detention is not based on any articulable facts giving rise to a suspicion of some illegal activity justifying an extension of the detention, the continued detention to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>conduct a search constitutes an illegal seizure. <em>(State v. Robinette </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 650, 653 N.E.2d 695, paragraph one of the syllabus, modified.)</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">{\u00b6 17} \u201c2. Under Section 14, Article I of the Ohio Constitution, the totality-of-the circumstances test is controlling in an unlawful detention to determine whether permission to search a vehicle is voluntary. <em>(State v. Robinette </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 650, 653 N.E.2d 695 [(Robinette <em>I)</em>], paragraph two of the syllabus, vacated.)</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">{\u00b6 18} \u201c3. Once an individual has been unlawfully detained by law enforcement, for his or her consent to be considered an independent act of free will, the totality of the circumstances must clearly demonstrate that a reasonable person would believe that he or she had the freedom to refuse to answer further questions and could in fact leave. <em>(Florida v. Royer </em>(1983), 460 U.S. 491, 103 S.Ct. 1319, 75 L.Ed.2d 229; <em>Schneckloth v. Bustamonte </em>(1973), 412 U.S. 218, 93 S.Ct. 2041, 36 L.Ed.2d 854, followed.)\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">{\u00b6 19} In <em>State v. Wilburn, </em>188 Ohio App.3d 384, 2010-Ohio-3536, 935 N.E.2d 509, at \u00b6 12, this court stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">{\u00b6 20} \u201c \u2018A police officer\u2019s request for consent to search a vehicle stopped for a traffic violation is valid if it is made, and voluntary consent is obtained, during the period of time reasonably necessary to process the traffic citation; in other words, while the driver is lawfully detained for the traffic violation. <em>State v. Loffer, </em>Montgomery App. No. 19594, 2003-Ohio-4980[, 2003 WL 22149647]; <em>State v. Swope </em>(Nov. 9, 1994), Miami App. No. 93CA46[, 1994 WL 619748]. On the other hand, once a traffic citation is issued and the purpose of the original stop is completed, the lawful basis for the detention ceases. If police thereafter seek consent to search the vehicle absent some reasonable, articulable suspicion of criminal activity other than the traffic violation, the continued detention is unlawful. <em>State v. Retherford </em>(1994), 93 Ohio App.3d 586[, 639 N.E.2d 498]; <em>State v. Robinette </em>[1997], 80 Ohio St.3d 234[, 685 N.E.2d 762] * * *. Any consent to search obtained during an unlawful detention is tainted and may be invalid. <em>Retherford. </em>For such consent to be voluntary, the totality of the circumstances must demonstrate that a reasonable person would believe that he or she had the freedom to refuse to answer further questions and could, in fact, leave. <em>Robinette.\u2019 State v. Watts, </em>Montgomery App. No. 21982, 2007-Ohio-2411, 2007 WL 1454045, \u00b6 12.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b154-9\">{\u00b6 21} Once Deputy Walters returned defendant\u2019s driver\u2019s license, registration, and proof of insurance to her and served her the traffic citation, the purpose of the original stop was completed, and the lawful basis for the detention of defendant ended. <em>Wilburn; Robinette. </em>Deputy Walters\u2019s subsequent or simultaneous request to search defendant\u2019s vehicle constituted an unlawful continued detention/seizure of defendant, unless Deputy Walters possessed a reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>suspicion that defendant was engaged in some additional criminal activity other than the traffic violations. Id.; <em>Terry v. Ohio </em>(1968), 392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">{\u00b6 22} The state argues that Deputy Walters had a reasonable suspicion that defendant was engaged in illegal drug activity, which justified continuing defendant\u2019s detention for further investigation, because (1) defendant was overly nervous during the traffic stop and her hands were shaking, (2) defendant was from Greenville, and her explanation for why she was in the Dayton area to pick up her child from daycare was suspicious and not reasonable due to the distance involved, (3) a check of defendant\u2019s license revealed that she had previously been arrested or convicted in Miami County for drug trafficking, and (4) the area of the traffic stop was a high crime, high drug activity area where Deputy Walters has made previous arrests for drug activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">{\u00b6 23} In <em>State v. Maldonado </em>(Sept. 24, 1993), Montgomery App. No. 13530, 1993 WL 402772, this court observed:</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">{\u00b6 24} \u201cLaw enforcement officers are authorized to briefly detain and question persons whom they reasonably suspect are involved in criminal activity in order to investigate and resolve those suspicions. <em>Terry v. Ohio </em>[392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889]. A suspicion is not reasonable merely because the officer possessed it; it must also, and necessarily, be one which a reasonable officer would maintain in the circumstances involved. Id. In any later judicial review, all the facts and circumstances before the officer must be given their due weight, and deference must be given to the officer\u2019s knowledge and experience when he or she acted on them. <em>State v. Freeman </em>(1980), 64 Ohio St.2d 291 [18 O.O.3d 472, 414 N.E.2d 1044]. Nevertheless, the officer must be able to articulate the grounds for the suspicion if it is later challenged. The officer may not rely on mere good faith or inarticulate hunches. <em>U.S. v. Porter [Poitier </em>] (8th Cir., 1987), 818 F.2d 679, cert. den. 484 U.S. 1006 [108 S.Ct. 700, 98 L.Ed.2d 651] (1984 [1988]). He must be able to articulate grounds from which a reasonable officer would infer that some specific criminal misconduct was afoot. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">{\u00b6 25} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b155-9\"> {\u00b6 26} \u201cSince the decision of the Supreme Court in <em>State v. Bobo </em>(1988), 37 Ohio St.3d 177 [524 N.E.2d 489], police officers have more frequently cited the reputation of a vicinity as a \u2018high crime area\u2019 when articulating their reasons for a <em>Terry </em>stop performed there. This may reflect the greater law enforcement focus on street-level drug crime, which is usually subtle in its methods and often violent in its consequences. However, those idiosyncracies do not diminish the requirements of the Fourth Amendment or its interpretation in <em>Terry. The </em>facts and circumstances before the officer must yet reasonably suggest that some specific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>criminal misconduct is afoot. That specificity requirement focuses on the criminal character of the act, not on its setting. Acts that are essentially neutral or ambiguous do not become specifically criminal in character because they occur in a high crime area. Acts that are not specifically criminal in character do not become criminal because they are inapposite to their setting and, therefore, \u2018suspicious\u2019. The setting can inform the officer\u2019s judgment, but it does not make the act criminal. In order to detain an individual to investigate for crime, some nexus between the individual and specific criminal conduct must reasonably exist and must be articulated by the officer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">{\u00b6 27} The fact that defendant was nervous and her hands were shaking when she was stopped by an officer is not particularly indicative of criminal conduct and is often innocent human behavior or ambiguous, at best. Defendant\u2019s explanation that she was in the area to pick up her child from daycare, when the child was in the vehicle with her, while perhaps odd in the sense that she would travel such a distance from Greenville to Dayton for child care, does not connote any criminal activity. The fact that at some time past defendant had been arrested or convicted of drug trafficking in Miami County is too stale to be of any value and, in any event, does not show that defendant was at the time of this traffic stop engaged in illegal drug activity. Finally, the fact that the area where this traffic stop occurred is a high crime/drug activity area where Deputy Walters has made previous arrests does not, without more, demonstrate that defendant was then engaging in some specific illegal conduct such as drug activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">{\u00b6 28} Simply stated, the totality of the facts and circumstances are not sufficient as a matter of law to give rise to a reasonable suspicion that defendant had been engaged in some specific criminal misconduct, such as drug activity. Accordingly, the continued detention of defendant to search her vehicle constituted an unlawful seizure. An illegal detention presumptively nullifies any consent that is a product of the detention. <em>Florida v. Royer </em>(1983), 460 U.S. 491, 103 S.Ct. 1319, 75 L.Ed.2d 229; <em>State v. Byrd, </em>185 Ohio App.3d 30, 2009-Ohio-5606, 923 N.E.2d 161, at \u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">{\u00b629} In <em>Robinette, </em>the Ohio Supreme Court held that voluntary consent, determined under the totality of the circumstances, may validate an otherwise illegal detention and search. Id., 80 Ohio St.3d at 241, 685 N.E.2d 762. However, once an individual has been unlawfully detained by law enforcement, for his or her consent to be considered an independent act of free will, the totality of the circumstances must clearly demonstrate that a reasonable person would believe that he or she had the freedom to refuse to answer further questions and could in fact leave. Id. at 245. The state has the burden to show, under the totality of the circumstances, that Defendant\u2019s consent to search her vehicle was a voluntary act of free will, as opposed to mere submission to an officer\u2019s superior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>position of authority, which is not sufficient to demonstrate a free and voluntary consent. <em>Royer; Robinette.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">{\u00b6 30} Deputy Walters\u2019s words did not give defendant any indication that she had the freedom to refuse to answer further questions and could in fact leave, but rather implied just the opposite. The timing of Deputy Walters\u2019s immediate transition from detaining defendant for the traffic violation and giving defendant the completed traffic citation and returning her driver\u2019s license to her, into his request to search defendant\u2019s vehicle, is troubling. As the Ohio Supreme Court observed in <em>Robinette I, </em>73 Ohio St.3d at 654, 653 N.E.2d 695:</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">{\u00b6 31} \u201cThe transition between detention and a consensual exchange can be so seamless that the untrained eye may not notice that it has occurred. The undetectability of that transition may be used by police officers to coerce citizens into answering questions that they need not answer, or to allow a search of a vehicle that they are not legally obligated to allow.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">{\u00b6 32} Upon giving- defendant the completed traffic citation and returning her driver\u2019s license to her, Deputy Walters simultaneously asked defendant if he could search her vehicle. Walters did not tell defendant that she could refuse to consent to a search of her vehicle. The circumstances surrounding Walters\u2019s request to search defendant\u2019s vehicle were implicitly coercive. <em>Robinette. </em>When these factors are combined with a police officer\u2019s superior position of authority, a reasonable person would have felt compelled to submit to the officer\u2019s request. Id. From the totality of the circumstances, defendant merely submitted to \u201ca claim of lawful authority\u201d rather than consenting as a voluntary act of free will. Id. Because defendant did not freely and voluntarily consent to Deputy Walters\u2019s search of her vehicle, the evidence of heroin discovered during that search must be suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">{\u00b6 33} Defendant\u2019s first and second assignments of error are sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-9\">Third Assignment of Error</p>\n<p id=\"b157-10\">{\u00b6 34} \u201cThe trial court erred to the defendant-appellant\u2019s prejudice when it overruled her motion to suppress because the search of the cigarette pack contained within her vehicle was outside the scope of what a reasonable person would have understood the officer was searching for at the time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b157-11\">{\u00b6 35} Defendant argues that even if the consent she gave to search her vehicle was voluntary, Deputy Walters\u2019s search of the cigarette pack he found inside the vehicle exceeded the scope of defendant\u2019s consent. Because this assignment of error is rendered moot by our disposition of the first and second assignments of error, we need not address it.
