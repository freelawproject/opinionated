While the parties stipulate to the facts in this case and to the liability of the tortfeasor, they disagree over whether the multiple collisions giving rise to this case constituted one accident for the purposes of insurance liability limits, or two. Given the failure of the insurance company to include a more precise definition of the policy term \u201caccident\u201d and to use limiting language found in other policies that have withstood judicial scrutiny, we find that the incidents giving rise to Miller\u2019s and Davis\u2019s claims constitute two accidents.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-16\">{\u00b6 2} Substantive Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b790-17\">{\u00b6 3} The facts in this case are undisputed. On the evening of July 12, 2008, Daniel Masterson was heading west on State Route 5, when he took his eyes off <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>the road in order to reach to the floorboard to retrieve his lighter and veered into the eastbound lane of traffic. The SUV that Masterson was driving collided with a group of motorcycles headed east. Masterson first collided with a motorcycle driven by David Perrine. In an attempt to avoid hitting Perrine\u2019s motorcycle, Michael Reese, who was driving behind Perrine, took evasive action but was unable to avoid hitting Perrine\u2019s motorcycle and sliding into his path. Perrine and his passenger, Julia Hill, and Reese and his passenger, Kim Mook, sustained injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">{\u00b6 4} Within 0.3 seconds of striking Perrine, Masterson struck a motorcycle driven by Geoffrey Davis, and then traveled back across the westbound lane before crashing into a guardrail. Davis and his passenger, Theresa Miller, were also injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">{\u00b6 5} Masterson was insured by MMIC, and his policy contained liability coverage for bodily injury with split limits of $100,000 for \u201ceach person\u201d and $300,000 for \u201ceach accident.\u201d No dispute exists as to Masterson\u2019s liability, nor is there a dispute that the collective value of the injuries sustained by Perrine, Hill, Reese, Mook, Davis, and Miller exceeded $300,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-7\">{\u00b6 6} A dispute does exist, however, as to whether the incidents constitute one accident, limiting MMIC\u2019s liability to a single $300,000-per-accident payment or whether they constitute two accidents, increasing MMIC\u2019s exposure in this case to, at most, $500,000. Miller and Davis contend that Masterson\u2019s collision with their motorcycle constitutes a separate accident from the initial collision with Perrine\u2019s motorcycle and that they are entitled to a separate $300,000-per-accident payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-8\">{\u00b6 <em>7} </em>Because MMIC\u2019s liability for at least one accident was not disputed, the parties entered into a covenant not to execute, which provided that MMIC would make one \u201ceach accident\u201d payment of $300,000 to be split among the six injured parties, but provided for the ability to file a declaratory-judgment action seeking interpretation of MMIC\u2019s policy, and determination of whether the incidents constituted one or two accidents. The covenant not to execute further provided that should a court determine the incident to be two accidents, MMIC would pay an additional $100,000 each to Miller and Davis.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-9\">{\u00b6 8} Miller and Davis ultimately filed a declaratory-judgment action, and the parties submitted cross-motions for summary judgment and declaratory relief. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of MMIC, finding, \u201cThe whole incident was one brief continuous course of conduct.\u201d The trial court relied on language in the \u201cLimitation of Liability\u201d portion of the policy to determine that \u201cthe term \u2018accident\u2019 or \u2018any one auto accident\u2019 includes all the vehicles involved in the collision.\u201d Applying the policy language to its finding that there was one continuous course of conduct, the trial court held that there was only one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>accident and that the parties were \u201ctherefore limited to a single recovery under the \u2018Each Accident\u2019 portion of [MMIC\u2019s] policy, regardless of the number of motorcycles involved in the incident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b792-4\">{\u00b6 9} Miller and Davis timely appealed and now bring the following assignment of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cThe trial court erred in ignoring this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Godwin </em>and in granting MMIC\u2019s motion for summary judgment and denying the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">{\u00b6 11} Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b792-7\">{\u00b6 12} We review de novo a trial court\u2019s order granting summary judgment. <em>Hapgood v. Conrad, </em>11th Dist. No. 2000-T-0058, 2002-Ohio-3363, 2002 WL 1400583, \u00b6 13, citing <em>Cole v. Am. Industries &amp; Resources Corp. </em>(1998), 128 Ohio App.3d 546, 715 N.E.2d 1179. \u201cA reviewing court will apply the same standard a trial court is required to apply, which is to determine whether any genuine issues of material fact exist and whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Id., citing <em>Parenti v. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. </em>(1990), 66 Ohio App.3d 826, 829, 586 N.E.2d 1121.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-8\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cSince summary judgment denies the party his or her \u2018day in court\u2019 it is not to be viewed lightly as docket control or as a \u2018little trial.\u2019 The jurisprudence of summary judgment standards has placed burdens on both the moving and the nonmoving party. In <em>Dresher v. Burt </em>[(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 280, 662 N.E.2d 264], the Supreme Court of Ohio held that the moving party seeking summary judgment bears the initial burden of informing the trial court of the basis for the motion and identifying those portions of the record before the trial court that demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of fact on a material element of the nonmoving party\u2019s claim. The evidence must be in the record or the motion cannot succeed. The moving party cannot discharge its initial burden under Civ.R. 56 simply by making a conclusory assertion that the nonmoving party has no evidence to prove its case but must be able to specifically point to some evidence of the type listed in Civ.R. 56(C) that affirmatively demonstrates that the nonmoving party has no evidence to support the nonmoving party\u2019s claims. If the moving party fails to satisfy its initial burden, the motion for summary judgment must be denied. If the moving party has satisfied its initial burden, the nonmoving party has a reciprocal burden outlined in the last sentence of Civ.R. 56(E) to set forth specific facts showing there is a genuine issue for trial. If the nonmoving party fails to do so, summary judgment, if appropriate shall be entered against the nonmoving party based on the principles that have been firmly established in Ohio for quite some time in <em>Mitseff v. Wheeler </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 112 [526 N.E.2d 798].\u201d <em>Welch v. Ziccarelli, </em>11th Dist. No. 2006-L-229, 2007-Ohio-4374, 2007 WL 2410102, \u00b6 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>{\u00b6 14} Interpretation of MMIC\u2019s Policy</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">{\u00b6 15} The controlling portion of MMIC\u2019s policy provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">{\u00b6 16} \u201cA. The limit of liability shown in the Declarations for this coverage is our maximum limit of liability for all damages resulting from any one auto accident. This is the most we will pay regardless of the number of:</p>\n<p id=\"b793-7\">{\u00b6 17} \u201c1.

Vehicles or premiums show in the Declarations; or</p>\n<p id=\"b793-10\">{\u00b6 20} <em>\u201c4. </em>Vehicles involved in the auto accident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b793-11\">{\u00b6 21} The policy, however, fails to define \u201caccident.\u201d Construction of written contracts, including insurance contracts, is a matter of law. <em>Time Warner Entertainment Co., L.P. v. Kleese-Beshara-Kleese, </em>11th Dist. No. 2009-T-0010, 2009-Ohio-6712, 2009 WL 4896222, \u00b6 27, citing <em>Alexander v. Buckeye Pipe Line Co. </em>(1978), 53 Ohio St.2d 241, 374 N.E.2d 146, paragraph one of the syllabus. \u201cWe review the interpretation of contracts de novo. <em>Nationwide Mut. Fire Ins. Co. v. Guman Bros. Farm </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 107, 108, 652 N.E.2d 684. We must give the language of an insurance policy its plain and ordinary meaning. <em>Dairyland Ins. Co. v. Finch </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 360, 362, 513 N.E.2d 1324. We cannot create ambiguity where there is none; a policy must be resolved in favor of the insured only when a provision in a policy is ambiguous and susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation. <em>Hacker v. Dickman </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 118, 119, 661 N.E.2d 1005.\u201d <em>OSI Sealants, Inc. v. Wausau Underwriters Ins. Co., </em>11th Dist. No. 2003-L-181, 2005-Ohio-2528, 2005 WL 1208121, \u00b6 19. Because language in insurance policies is selected by the insurers, and they have ample opportunity to specifically define terms and protect themselves from liability, any ambiguity will be construed in favor of the insured. See <em>Gomolka v. State Auto. Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1982), 70 Ohio St.2d 166, 169, 436 N.E.2d 1347.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-12\">{\u00b6 22} The question before the trial court and this court is whether the policy term \u201caccident\u201d is ambiguous. MMIC invites us, despite having failed to provide a definition for \u201caccident,\u201d to construe the term as the courts did in <em>Banner v. Raisin Valley, Inc. </em>(N.D.Ohio 1998), 31 F.Supp.2d 591, and <em>Progressive Preferred Ins. Co. v. Derby </em>(June 15, 2001), 6th Dist. No. F-01-002, 2001 WL 672177, and adhere to a \u201ccausation approach.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b793-13\">{\u00b6 23} The \u201ccausation approach\u201d to policy interpretation focuses on the cause of the insured event, not the effects. See <em>Banner </em>at 593. However, \u201cboth the decisions in <em>Banner </em>and in <em>Derby, </em>while citing to the causation view in determining that one accident or occurrence had resulted in multiple injuries, were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>fundamentally based on construction of the term \u2018accident\u2019 in the subject liability policies. And, the definition of accident in each policy demanded those courts find that one accident or occurrence had resulted in multiple injuries.\u201d <em>Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. Godwin, </em>11th Dist. No. 2005-L-183, 2006-Ohio-4167, 2006 WL 2337199, \u00b6 48.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">{\u00b6 24} In both <em>Banner </em>and <em>Derby, </em>the limitation-of-liability clause contained the same phrase \u201cregardless of the number of vehicles involved in the auto accident\u201d found in MMIC\u2019s policy. This is the limiting language relied upon by the trial court below. In an attempt to distinguish this case from <em>Godwin, </em>the trial court surmises that the <em>Godwin </em>court \u201capparently had insufficient policy language to help define the terms \u2018accident\u2019 or \u2018occurrence,\u2019 \u201d because the <em>Godwin </em>decision does not refer to such limiting language in its opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">{\u00b6 25} But the real distinction lies in an omission in the MMIC policy, and it is this distinctive omission that controls the outcome of the case before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-7\">{\u00b6 26} While the <em>Godwin </em>decision only alludes to the policy language that controlled the outcome in <em>Banner </em>and <em>Derby, </em>we definitively find that the interpretation reached in <em>Banner </em>and <em>Derby </em>was dictated by the inclusion of a standard policy definition of the term \u201caccident\u201d as \u201ca sudden, unexpected and unintended event, or a continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same conditions.\u201d Unlike <em>Banner </em>and <em>Derby, </em>the MMIC policy contains no such standard policy language. MMIC chose the less descriptive and thus less limiting definitional language, and thus we have no alternative but to construe the ambiguity against the insurance company.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-8\">{\u00b6 27} Furthermore, MMIC suggests that the liability provisions, when considered as a whole, are clear and unambiguous as to the meaning of \u201caccident.\u201d We however, look to the plain meaning of the word. The plain and ordinary meaning of \u201caccident\u201d is \u201can unexpected and undesirable event.\u201d Websters II New College Dictionary (1999) 6. \u201cA person unversed in the technicalities of insurance law might, therefore, easily conclude that [the insureds striking of each of the vehicles], sequentially, constituted separate accidents or occurrences, rather than the single accident or occurrence of losing control of the [car] * * <em>Godwin </em>at \u00b6 49.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-9\">{\u00b6 28} We may arrive at this same conclusion from a causation analysis as well. In considering the cause of Perrine\u2019s, Hill\u2019s, Reese\u2019s, and Mook\u2019s injuries as compared to the cause of Miller\u2019s and Davis\u2019s injuries, they appear decidedly different. The injuries to the former group are as a direct result of Masterson\u2019s collision with Perrine\u2019s motorcycle. Miller\u2019s and Davis\u2019s injuries, however, do not stem from that collision; instead, they are a direct result of an independent collision between Masterson\u2019s vehicle and their own motorcycle.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>{\u00b6 29} The trial court reasoned that \u201cthere is no legal or practical difference between a succession of collisions caused by a single vehicle striking one vehicle ahead of it \u2014 which strikes the next vehicle ahead, and where a single vehicle strikes multiple vehicles in succession. The <em>same active continuous force </em>is causing damage to multiple vehicles * * (Emphasis added.) The trial court then concluded that MMIC\u2019s policy \u201cclearly applies to both types of accidents and the results should be the same.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">{\u00b6 30} We would agree with the trial court had MMIC included the phrase \u201ccontinuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same conditions\u201d in its policy, but it did not. Thus, as a matter of contract interpretation, the results <em>cannot </em>be the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">{\u00b6 31} MMICs liability policy specifically accounts for and limits its liability in an event such as the first collision, a chain reaction if you will, whereby the same automobile strike causes injuries to multiple parties and vehicles. The policy, however, does not specifically contemplate and limit MMICs liability in a sequence of events as presented in this case, where two separate and\" distinct automobile strikes cause injury to multiple parties. MMIC had the opportunity to define \u201caccident\u201d and construct its policy in a way that limited its liability in a situation such as the one before us. It chose not to do so, and thus we must construe the ambiguity in favor of Miller and Davis.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-7\">{\u00b6 32} The assignment of error is meritorious, and the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Portage County is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-8\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b795-9\">Rice and Wright, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
