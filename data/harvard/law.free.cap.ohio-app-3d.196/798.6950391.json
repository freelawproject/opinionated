For the reasons that follow, we affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-7\">{\u00b6 2} The relevant facts of this case are as follows. On May 9, 2008, appellant was indicted on two counts of aggravated murder, R.C. 2903.01(A) and 2903.01(B), with gun specifications, one count of aggravated robbery, R.C. 2911.01(A)(1), one count of trafficking in marijuana, R.C. 2925.03(A)(1) and 2925.03(C)(3)(c), and one count of trafficking in cocaine, R.C. 2925.03(A)(1) and 2925.03(C)(4)(e). The aggravated-murder charge included a death-penalty specification. R.C. 2929.04(A)(7). The charges stemmed from the March 11, 2008 murder and robbery of Calvin Harper Jr. in Sandusky, Erie County, Ohio. Appellant entered not-guilty pleas to the counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-8\">{\u00b6 3} On January 12, 2009, appellant filed a motion to suppress the identification of appellant, by three witnesses, by use of a photo array that he claimed was unduly suggestive. Specifically, appellant argued that the lighting and the angle of his photograph \u201covertly or \u2019 subliminally\u201d pointed to him as the suspect. During the April 23, 2009 suppression hearing, it was also discovered that the eyewitnesses knew several of the other individuals placed in the array.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-9\">{\u00b6 4} On June 3, 2009, the trial court denied appellant\u2019s motion to suppress. Appellant requested findings of fact and conclusions of law, and on September 30, 2009, the court issued a detailed, 13-page judgment entry that analyzed the identification procedure under the test set forth in <em>Neil v. Biggers </em>(1972), 409 U.S. 188, 93 S.Ct. 375, 34 L.Ed.2d 401. In its entry, the trial court found that the identification procedure was not unduly suggestive and also rejected the argument that the differences in the photo itself made the array unduly suggestive. However, the court found that considering the subtle differences in the photo and because the witnesses knew the other individuals in the array, the array was unduly suggestive. The court ultimately concluded that the reliability of the identifications outweighed any likelihood of misidentification.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-10\">{\u00b6 5} In the interim, on June 25, 2009, appellant filed a motion for court funds to appoint an identification expert. Appellant argued that because identification was a key component in the case, appointment of an expert was necessary to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>explain the difficulties inherent in the identification-array procedure. On February 1, 2010, the motion was denied. On April 5, 2010, appellant orally renewed the motion, stating that he had contacted an expert in Ohio who would cost less. On April 12, 2010, the court summarily denied the motion, noting that no new arguments were presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">{\u00b6 6} On October 15, 2009, the court granted the state\u2019s motion to dismiss the death-penalty specification and to join the two defendants for trial. Appellant opposed the joinder and, on February 1, 2010, separate trials were ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-6\">{\u00b6 7} On April 20, 2010, appellant\u2019s jury trial commenced. According to the state\u2019s testimony, on March 10, 2008, appellant and his co-defendant, Aaron Gipson, drove down from the Canton, Michigan, area; the two played cards at witness Crystal Harris\u2019s apartment with the victim\u2019s sister, Chanel Harper. Co-defendant Aaron Gipson was a reputed drug dealer and known to the victim\u2019s family and friends.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-7\">{\u00b6 8} Witnesses testified that the victim had a large sum of money in his apartment and planned to purchase drugs from Gipson, a supplier, and then sell the drugs. The victim\u2019s neighbor and confidant, Rhonda Farris, testified that between 4:00 and 5:00 p.m., a man she later identified as appellant mistakenly knocked on her door. Farris immediately called Harper to tell him that someone was looking for him. According to Farris, the victim indicated that he was expecting the man. Farris never spoke to the victim again and, the next day, discovered his body.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-8\">{\u00b6 9} Three eyewitnesses identified appellant from a photo array. Farris, as stated above, Crystal Pool, and Chanel Harper each identified appellant as the man with Aaron Gipson on March 10, 2008. All three women knew either a few or all of the other individuals in the photo array.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-9\">{\u00b6 10} The state focused, in depth, on the cellular telephone records of Gipson from March 10 through March 11, 2008. Depending on how rural or urban the area, the records were able to show, within a ten-mile to two-block radius, which cell tower the cell phone was transmitting from. The evidence showed that on March 10, 2008, returning to Canton, Michigan, from Sandusky, Gipson drove north, past the Canton area to the area where appellant had been living, and then proceeded back south to home. On March 11, 2008, prior to proceeding to Sandusky, Gipson again drove north from his home to the area where appellant lived. Further, after the time of Harper\u2019s murder, Gipson again went north, then turned back south and went to a casino in Detroit. Appellant did not have a cellular telephone, but there were calls made from Gipson\u2019s number to Deotis Sears\u2019s cell phone. Sears was appellant\u2019s uncle, and he had been living with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>{\u00b6 11} There was also testimony that appellant denied knowing Gipson. Further, appellant stated to police that he was living in Atlanta, Georgia (where he was ultimately arrested), and that he had returned to Atlanta on February 19, 2008. However, police found a bus ticket from Michigan to Atlanta dated March 28, 2008. There were also incriminating, though cryptic, statements recorded in jail telephone conversations from appellant to his girlfriend.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">{\u00b6 12} Police testified, over objection, that appellant\u2019s co-defendant, Gipson, pointed him out to police while they drove him by where he was residing. Further, appellant\u2019s former brother-in-law, Dewon Smith, testified that Aaron Gipson is a friend of the Hicks family and that appellant knew him. Smith testified that on March 10, 2008, Gipson picked up appellant at his home; he returned later that night.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">{\u00b6 13} Following the presentation of evidence, the jury found appellant guilty of aggravated murder, aggravated robbery, and the drug charges. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-7\">{\u00b6 14} Appellant now raises the following seven assignments of error for our review:</p>\n<p id=\"b839-8\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cAssignment of Error I: The trial court committed reversible error when it allowed into evidence at Mr. Ricks\u2019 trial unreliable eyewitness identification evidence, in violation of Mr. Ricks\u2019 Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights under the United States Constitution, and Sections 10 and 16, Article I of the Ohio Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-9\">{\u00b6 16} \u201cAssignment of Error II: The trial court abused its discretion and denied Mr. Ricks the ability to present a complete defense to the State\u2019s charges when it denied his motions for a court-appointed expert regarding eyewitness identification, in violation of Mr. Ricks\u2019 rights under the Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, and Sections 10 and 16, Article I of the Ohio Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-10\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cAssignment of Error III: Mr. Ricks was denied his right to confront the evidence against him at trial, in violation of his Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights under the United States Constitution and Sections 10 and 16, Article I of the Ohio Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-11\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cAssignment of Error IV: The cumulative nature of the trial court\u2019s errors during Mr. Ricks\u2019 trial, as presented within Assignments of Error I, II, and III, denied Mr. Ricks\u2019 rights to a fair trial and due process of law, in violation of the Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, and Sections 10 and 16, Article I of the Ohio Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-12\">{\u00b6 19} \u201cAssignment of Error V: The trial court violated Mr. Ricks\u2019 rights to due process and a fair trial when, in the absence of sufficient evidence, the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>court convicted Mr. Ricks of complicity to trafficking in marijuana and complicity to trafficking in cocaine, in violation of Mr. Ricks\u2019 Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights under the United States Constitution, and Sections 10 and 16, Article I of the Ohio Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">{\u00b6 20} \u201cAssignment of Error VI: The trial court committed plain error when it failed to merge the firearm specifications regarding Mr. Ricks\u2019 convictions for aggravated murder and aggravated robbery, in violation of R.C. 2929.14(D)(1)(b), and in violation of Mr. Ricks\u2019 rights under the Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, and Sections 10 and 16, Article I of the Ohio Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">{\u00b6 21} \u201cAssignment of Error VII: Defense counsel rendered ineffective assistance of counsel in violation of Mr. Ricks\u2019 rights under the Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, and Sections 10 and 16, Article I of the Ohio Constitution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b840-7\">{\u00b6 22} In appellant\u2019s first assignment of error, he asserts that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress the photo-array identifications where the size and lighting of appellant\u2019s photo, combined with the fact that the witnesses knew many of the individuals in the lineup, were so unduly suggestive that the reliability of the identifications could not outweigh the prejudicial effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-8\">{\u00b6 23} Initially we note that review of a trial court\u2019s grant or denial of a motion to suppress presents mixed questions of law and fact. <em>State v. Burnside, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 152, 2003-Ohio-5372, 797 N.E.2d 71, \u00b6 8. An appellate court defers to a trial court\u2019s factual findings made with respect to its ruling on a motion to suppress when the findings are supported by competent, credible evidence. <em>Id.; State v. Brooks </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 148, 154, 661 N.E.2d 1030. \u201c[T]he appellate court must then independently determine, without deference to the conclusion of the trial court, whether the facts satisfy the applicable legal standard.\u201d <em>Burnside </em>at \u00b6 8, citing <em>State v. McNamara </em>(1997), 124 Ohio App.3d 706, 707, 707 N.E.2d 539.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-9\">{\u00b6 24} The United States Supreme Court has considered due process limitations on the use of evidence derived through suggestive identification procedures. The court used a two-prong analysis: \u201cWhen a witness has been confronted with a suspect before trial, due process requires a court to suppress her identification of the suspect if the confrontation was unnecessarily suggestive of the suspect\u2019s guilt and the identification was unreliable under all the circumstances.\u201d <em>State v. Waddy </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 424, 438, 588 N.E.2d 819, superseded by constitutional amendment on other grounds, citing <em>Neil v. Biggers, </em>409 U.S. 188, 93 S.Ct. 375, 34 L.Ed.2d 401; <em>Manson v. Brathwaite </em>(1977), 432 U.S. 98, 97 S.Ct. 2243, 53 L.Ed.2d 140. The first question is whether the identification procedure was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>unnecessarily suggestive of the defendant\u2019s guilt. <em>Id. </em>The second is \u201cwhether, under all the circumstances, the identification was reliable, <em>i.e., </em>whether suggestive procedures created \u2018a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 439, quoting <em>Simmons v. United States </em>(1968), 390 U.S. 377, 384, 88 S.Ct. 967, 19 L.Ed.2d 1247.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">{\u00b6 25} On April 23, 2009, a suppression hearing was held. Sandusky Police Detective Gary Wichman testified that after interviewing appellant\u2019s co-defendant, Aaron Gipson, in Canton, Michigan, appellant was identified as a suspect in the death of Calvin Harper. A photograph was obtained from Cobb County, Georgia, and was e-mailed to Sandusky County. Using the photograph, a photo array was developed. Appellant\u2019s photograph was placed in slot six (out of eight).</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">{\u00b6 26} Detective Wichman testified that he was present when the array was shown to two of the three witnesses. Rhonda Farris, the victim\u2019s neighbor, was told that the police had a suspect and that he was in the array. Farris identified appellant as the individual who mistakenly knocked on her door just prior to the murder. According to Wichman, Chanel Harper, the victim\u2019s sister, identified appellant after she played cards for a few hours with him and Gipson. That was the first occasion she had met appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-7\">{\u00b6 27} During cross-examination, Wichman was questioned regarding the reflection on appellant\u2019s face in the photograph. Wichman said that he had not noticed it until defense counsel pointed it out.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-8\">{\u00b6 28} Detective Eric Graybill testified that he compiled the photo array. Graybill stated that in compiling the array, he looked for photographs with similar backgrounds and individuals with similar physical characteristics. Detective Graybill stated that the photographs were selected from those already in the department\u2019s system. Graybill said that he did not know where the other individuals in the array lived.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-9\">{\u00b6 29} The three witnesses who identified appellant testified. Crystal Pool testified that on March 10, 2008, she spent a few hours with appellant at her friend\u2019s house. That was the first time she had met appellant. Regarding the photo array, Pool admitted that she knew \u201cjust about everybody in the picture,\u201d but that she recognized appellant, too. Pool testified that she would never forget his eyes.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-10\">{\u00b6 30} Chanel Harper testified that the victim was her brother. Harper stated that Gipson and appellant were at her home on March 10, 2008. Regarding the photo array, Harper testified that she knew \u201cmainly all of\u2019 the individuals in the array and went to school with some of them. Harper stated that she was \u201cvery sure\u201d of her identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>{\u00b6 31} Rhonda Farris testified that she lived next door to the victim and that just before the murder, a man mistakenly knocked on her door. Farris testified that they were approximately six inches apart. Farris testified that she was \u201cvery sure\u201d that the individual was appellant, and she picked him out of the photo array. Farris stated that her cousin was in the array and that she knew all the others. Farris stated that she \u201cpicked him out first\u201d before she even looked at the other photos.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">{\u00b6 32} Detective Helen Prosowski testified that she presented the photo array with Detective Wichman, separately, to Chanel Harper and Rhonda Farris. It was presented approximately ten days after the murder. Prosowski testified that both women immediately identified appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">{\u00b6 33} As set forth above, the trial court found that the subtle differences in the photograph, combined with the fact that the witnesses knew some or all of the individuals in the array, made the array unduly suggestive. However, the court ultimately concluded that their certainty in identifying appellant combined with the relatively short length of time between the crime and the array negated any likelihood of misidentification.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-7\">{\u00b6 34} Appellant\u2019s chief argument is that because the witnesses knew the other individuals in the array, they would, by process of elimination, be more likely to identify appellant as the alleged perpetrator. Ohio courts have not squarely addressed this issue; however, it has been dealt with in other jurisdictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-8\">{\u00b6 35} In <em>State v. Battle </em>(2008), 312 Wis.2d 481, 751 N.W.2d 903, the victim was shot multiple times by a group of four men, including the appellant. The victim identified appellant from a photo array. Defense counsel moved to suppress the identification. The motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-9\">{\u00b6 36} At some point it was revealed that the victim knew all of the people in the six-person photo array. The court concluded that the appellant failed to demonstrate that the array was unduly suggestive. The court noted that the detective did not suggest to the victim who to pick and that the victim immediately recognized and identified the appellant. The court noted that \u201c[t]he fact that [the victim] recognized all of the people depicted in the array from the neighborhood\u201d did not affect the reliability of the identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-10\">{\u00b6 37} Similarly, in <em>State v. Stokes </em>(Kan.App.2004), 87 P.3d 375, an unknown passenger in a vehicle shot another passenger and stole his money. The victim identified the appellant from a six-person photo array. Though he quickly identified the appellant, he admitted that he knew four of the individuals in the array.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-11\">{\u00b6 38} In its analysis, the court noted that prior to the identification, the detective did not know that the victim knew the other individuals. Further, there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>was no evidence that the detective suggested the appellant\u2019s photo to the victim. The court concluded that even if the array was suggestive, the identification was reliable.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">{\u00b6 39} Finally, in <em>People v. James </em>(1963), 218 Cal.App.2d 166, 32 Cal.Rptr. 283, and <em>Younger v. Delaware </em>(Del.1985), 496 A.2d 546, ununiformed police officers were placed in the lineups. Some of the witnesses knew one or more of the individuals. The courts allowed the identifications focusing on the certainty of the identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">{\u00b6 40} Appellant also argued that Detective Wichman\u2019s statement that a suspect was included in the photo array was unduly suggestive. In <em>State v. Starks, </em>6th Dist. Nos. L-05-1417 and L-05-1419, 2007-Ohio-4897, 2007 WL 2745360, this court noted that a police officer\u2019s statement that a suspect was included among those in the array, without more, was not impermissibly suggestive. We noted that \u201c[i]t seems not unreasonable for a witness to assume that any time police show a photo array, one of the pictures there is of an individual of police interest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-7\">{\u00b6 41} In the present case, we cannot say that the trial court erred when, despite finding the array unduly suggestive, it denied appellant\u2019s motion to suppress the identifications. First, Chanel Harper and Crystal Pool spent an extended period of time with the suspect and were very certain that appellant was the individual with Gipson. Farris, although she only saw appellant for a brief period of time, was also very certain in her identification. The suspect was approximately six inches from her face and it was still light outside. Next, the identification was made within a short period of time. Further, the officers testified that they did not intend to put known individuals in the array and, in fact, only learned of this fact at the hearing. In its September 30, 2009 judgment entry, the court thoroughly addressed all the relevant factors in assessing the reliability of the identification. Thus, under the totality of the circumstances, we find that the identifications were reliable and there was no likelihood of misidenti-fication. Appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-8\">{\u00b6 42} In appellant\u2019s second assignment of error, he contends that the trial court erred when it denied his request for a court-appointed identification expert. Specifically, appellant argues that an expert was necessary because the eyewitness identifications were critical in his case due to the lack of physical evidence linking him to the crime. Conversely, the state argues that the case law relied upon by appellant is distinguishable in that multiple witnesses identified appellant and there was additional evidence linking him to the crime. Thus, the jury was capable of assessing the witnesses\u2019 ability to observe and remember.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>{\u00b6 43} R.C. 2929.024 requires the trial court to grant funds in aggravated-murder cases for investigative services and experts when \u201creasonably necessary for the proper representation\u201d of indigent defendants. In <em>State v. Mason </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 144, 694 N.E.2d 932, syllabus, the Supreme Court of Ohio held that due process \u201crequires that an indigent criminal defendant be provided funds to obtain expert assistance at state expense only where the trial court finds, in the exercise of a sound discretion, that the defendant has made a particularized showing (1) of a reasonable probability that the requested expert would aid in his defense, and (2) that denial of the requested expert assistance would result in an unfair trial.\u201d See also Evid.R. 702.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">{\u00b6 44} In addition, such testimony is generally admissible only as to factors that may affect the accuracy of a typical, not a particular, eyewitness identification. <em>State v. Dewitt, </em>2d Dist. No. 21620, 2007-Ohio-3437, 2007 WL 1934335, \u00b6 67, citing <em>State v. Buell </em>(1986), 22 Ohio St.3d 124, 131, 489 N.E.2d 795. This is so because it is the jury\u2019s role to assess the credibility of the witness. <em>Id. </em>at 132.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">{\u00b6 45} Relied on by appellant, in <em>State v. Bradley, </em>181 Ohio App.3d 40, 2009-Ohio-460, 907 N.E.2d 1205, the court concluded that an eyewitness-identification expert was necessary to the appellant\u2019s defense where his identity hinged on the identification of the sole witness and victim, the victim had been subjected to a stressful event, the identification was cross-racial, and the identification was made 30 days after the incident. Similarly, in <em>State v. Sargent, </em>169 Ohio App.3d 679, 2006-Ohio-6823, 864 N.E.2d 155, the victim, robbed at gunpoint, was the sole witness. The court determined that under the circumstances, because the identification may be unreliable, the court abused its discretion in denying the motion for an identification expert. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-7\">{\u00b6 46} Distinguishing <em>Bradley, </em>in <em>State v. Clark, </em>8th Dist. No. 94406, 2010-Ohio-5600, 2010 WL 4684471, the Eighth Appellate District found that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying a motion to allow expert testimony. Though a relevancy, not a funding, issue, the court denied the expert, noting that the identification was made just days after the crime and that the identification was not cross-racial. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-8\">{\u00b6 47} In <em>State v. Gray, </em>8th Dist. No. 92303, 2010-Ohio-240, 2010 WL 320481, although the circumstances of the identification were similar to <em>Bradley, </em>and <em>Sargent, </em>the court held that the trial court did not err when it denied the defendant\u2019s request for an eyewitness-identification expert. Unlike those cases, the court concluded that because there was an abundance of corroborating evidence, there was no reasonable probability that an identification expert would aid in his defense. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 51.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>{\u00b6 48} The present case is distinguishable from <em>Bradley </em>and <em>Sargent </em>in that the identifications were not made while the eyewitnesses were under stress and they were not cross-racial. In addition, the identifications were made approximately ten days after the murder. Admittedly, unlike <em>Gray, </em>there is not a significant amount of corroborating evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">{\u00b6 49} During appellant\u2019s trial, the witnesses were thoroughly questioned about their identification of appellant. Chanel Harper testified that she was 100 percent sure that appellant was the individual at her home with Gipson. Harper stated that even though she recognized others in the array, her eyes went directly to appellant\u2019s photo. Similarly, Crystal Pool stated that she remembered appellant\u2019s eyes and that she was 100 percent sure of her identification. Harper admitted to knowing some of the other people in the array, but stated that it did not affect her certainty that she had correctly identified appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">{\u00b6 50} Rhonda Farris testified that her knowledge of the individuals in the photo array (including her cousin) did not affect her certainty that on March 11, 2008, appellant was the individual who knocked on her door. Farris stated that she did not identify the other individuals in the array until she pointed out appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-7\">{\u00b6 51} At the conclusion of the trial, the court instructed the jury as to the <em>Neil v. Biggers </em>factors to consider in weighing the identifying witness testimony. The court stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b845-8\">{\u00b6 52} \u201cNumber One. Capacity of the witness, that is, the age, intelligence, defective senses, if any, and the opportunity of the witness to observe.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-9\">{\u00b6 53} \u201cTwo. The witness\u2019 degree of attention at the time he or she observed the subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-10\">{\u00b6 54} \u201cThree. The accuracy of witness\u2019 prior description or identification, if any.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-11\">{\u00b6 55} \u201cFour. Whether witness had occasion to observe defendant in the past.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-12\">{\u00b6 56} \u201cFive. The interval of time between the event and the identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-13\">{\u00b6 57} \u201cSix. All surrounding circumstances on which witness had identified defendant, including deficiencies, if any, in any lineup, photo display, or one-on-one.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b845-14\">{\u00b6 58} Based on the foregoing, we cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion when it denied appellant\u2019s request for an identification expert. Appellant\u2019s second assignment of error is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-15\">{\u00b6 59} Appellant\u2019s third assignment of error asserts that the trial court denied his right to confront witnesses by allowing, over objection, the introduc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>tion of inculpatory statements by appellant\u2019s nontestifying co-defendant. Specifically, appellant objected to testimony that co-defendant Gipson identified him for the police. Conversely, the state contends that the testimony was offered only to explain the officers\u2019 conduct during the course of the investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">{\u00b6 60} The testimony at issue was elicited during the direct examination of Canton, Michigan, police officer Michael Steckel. Officer Steckel testified that he was contacted by the Sandusky Police Department regarding shooting suspects Aaron Gipson and an individual nicknamed \u201cPeanut.\u201d In order to identify Peanut, Steckel and another officer drove Gipson to Strathmoor Street, on the west side of Detroit, where Gipson said that Peanut lived. Over objection, Steckel stated that Gipson identified Peanut, who was standing in front of the residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">{\u00b6 61} Once Gipson identified Peanut, further investigation revealed appellant\u2019s name. Steckel testified that they were able to obtain a photograph from another state, which was forwarded to Sandusky. The officers then showed Gipson the photograph of appellant and asked him if it was Peanut. Defense counsel objected, and a bench conference was held. Thereafter, the court issued the following curative instruction:</p>\n<p id=\"b846-7\">{\u00b6 62} \u201cLadies and gentlemen of the jury, one of the things that you just heard a few seconds ago from the State was \u2014 was hearsay, and there\u2019s a concern all the time that statements are made outside of Court and that actual person doesn\u2019t come into Court and testify and is not subject to cross examination. There are certain exceptions in the law and that deals with the Evidence Rules that I spoke about yesterday, that we have to comply with those rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-8\">{\u00b6 63} \u201cSometimes in allowing in information such as that, information that comes in from someone that (inaudible) testify in open Court, there\u2019s a purpose for that, and in this case the evidence about Mr. Gipson going with police detectives and, first off, pointing out a residence; second, pointing out the person on the street known as Peanut, and saying that\u2019s Peanut, and then later showing the photograph to Mr. Gipson and him saying that\u2019s Mr. Ricks, all those are not for the truth of the matter asserted. In other words, they don\u2019t necessarily mean that that was Peanut, that man walking down the street, that that was the residence he lived at or that\u2019s the photograph, but they\u2019re really brought in for the purpose to explain this officer or that department\u2019s investigation, why they were doing what they were doing, and the State has laid a foundation, what was your purpose of going out there and those kinds of things. So understand when you\u2019re hearing this testimony that it\u2019s to describe this officer and that department\u2019s investigation in conjunction with the Sandusky Police Department.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b846-9\">{\u00b6 64} Questioning continued. Officer Steckel testified that he showed Gipson the photograph of appellant and that Gipson stated it was Peanut. At the close <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>of the state\u2019s case, the state indicated that Gipson was available to testify per defense counsel\u2019s request. Counsel stated that after speaking with appellant, they did not wish to call Gipson as a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">{\u00b6 65} Appellant now argues that the testimony regarding what Gipson told police was hearsay and violated his right to confront Gipson on cross-examination. We first note that the admission or exclusion of evidence rests within the sound discretion of the trial court and, therefore, such decisions will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Sage </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 173, 180, 510 N.E.2d 343.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">{\u00b6 66} In all criminal prosecutions, the defendant has a constitutional right to confront the witnesses against him. <em>Lilly v. Virginia </em>(1999), 527 U.S. 116, 123, 119 S.Ct. 1887, 144 L.Ed.2d 117. \u201c \u2018The central concern of the Confrontation Clause is to ensure the reliability of the evidence against a criminal defendant by subjecting it to rigorous testing in the context of an adversary proceeding before the trier of fact.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 123-124, quoting <em>Maryland v. Craig </em>(1990), 497 U.S. 836, 845, 110 S.Ct. 3157, 111 L.Ed.2d 666.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-9\">{\u00b6 67} Appellant argues that the trial court\u2019s reliance on <em>State v. Blevins </em>(1987), 36 Ohio App.3d 147, 521 N.E.2d 1105, in allowing the testimony, was in error. In <em>Blevins, </em>the court considered the admissibility of an officer\u2019s testimony regarding statements of a drug purchaser. The court concluded that the statements were not hearsay; rather, they were offered to show how the officers came to know the defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 149. The court noted that the statements \u201cneither implicated nor cleared defendant.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b847-10\">{\u00b6 68} Following <em>Blevins, </em>in <em>State v. Williams, </em>10th Dist. Nos. 02AP-730 and 02AP-731, 2003-Ohio-5204, 2003 WL 22232921, a police officer testified that he stopped a vehicle suspected of being used in a robbery. One of the occupants informed the officer that a family member had used the van earlier that day and revealed the family member\u2019s location. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 46. The court concluded that there was no hearsay violation and that the officer\u2019s testimony was given to explain his conduct during the course of the investigation. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 49.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-11\">{\u00b6 69} In the present case, we have a co-defendant who identified an individual he believed to be Peanut. There is no evidence that Gipson used the opportunity to exonerate himself and implicate appellant. Once Peanut was identified as appellant, the Sandusky officers were able to compile a photo array. Further, the court issued a lengthy curative instruction to ensure that the jury properly interpreted the testimony. Finally, Gipson was made available for questioning but appellant declined. Based on the foregoing, we find that the trial court did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>not err in allowing the testimony. Appellant\u2019s third assignment of error is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-4\">{\u00b6 70} Appellant\u2019s fourth assignment of error contends that based on the cumulative errors set forth above, appellant was denied his right to a fair trial and due process of law. We have stated that \u201calthough a particular error by itself may not constitute prejudicial error, the cumulative effect of the errors may deprive a defendant of a fair trial and may warrant the reversal of his conviction.\u201d <em>State v. Hemsley, </em>6th Dist. No. WM-02-010, 2003-Ohio-5192, 2003 WL 22233792, \u00b6 32, citing <em>State v. DeMarco </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 191, 509 N.E.2d 1256, paragraph two of the syllabus. \u201c \u2018However, in order even to consider whether \u201ccumulative\u201d error is present, we would first have to find that multiple errors were committed in this case.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hemsley </em>at \u00b6 32, quoting <em>State v. Madrigal </em>(2000), 87 Ohio St.3d 378, 398, 721 N.E.2d 52.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">{\u00b6 71} Upon review of appellant\u2019s preceding three assignments of error, we cannot say that there were multiple instances of harmless error; accordingly, there can be no cumulative error. Appellant\u2019s fourth assignment of error is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">{\u00b6 72} In appellant\u2019s fifth assignment of error, he argues that his convictions for complicity to trafficking in marijuana and complicity to trafficking in cocaine were not supported by sufficient evidence. In reviewing a claim of sufficiency of the evidence, the relevant inquiry is whether any rational factfinder, viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the state, could have found all the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Jones </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 403, 417, 739 N.E.2d 300, citing <em>Jackson v. Virginia </em>(1979), 443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560, and <em>State v. Jenks </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 574 N.E.2d 492, paragraph two of the syllabus. \u201cOn review for sufficiency, courts are to assess not whether the state\u2019s evidence is to be believed, but whether, if believed, the evidence against a defendant would support a conviction.\u201d <em>State v. Thompkins </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 390, 678 N.E.2d 541 (Cook, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-7\">{\u00b6 73} Appellant was convicted of complicity to trafficking in marijuana in the vicinity of a school in an amount greater than 200 grams but less than 1,000 grams, R.C. 2925.03(A)(1) and (C)(3)(c), and 2923.03(A)(2). Appellant was also convicted of complicity to trafficking in cocaine in the vicinity of a school in an amount greater than 100 grams but less than 500 grams, R.C. 2925.03(A)(1) and (C)(4)(e), and 2925.03(A)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-8\">{\u00b6 74} R.C. 2923.03, the complicity statute, provides that \u201c[n]o person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the commission of an offense, shall do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>any of the following: * * * (3) Conspire with another to commit the offense in violation of R.C. 2923.012 of the Revised Code * *</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">{\u00b6 75} The trafficking statute, R.C. 2925.03, provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b849-6\">{\u00b6 76} \u201c(A) No person shall knowingly do any of the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b849-7\">{\u00b6 77} \u201c(1) Sell or offer to sell a controlled substance;</p>\n<p id=\"b849-8\">{\u00b6 78} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b849-9\">{\u00b6 79} \u201c(C) Whoever violates division (A) of this section is guilty of one of the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b849-10\">{\u00b6 80} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b849-11\">{\u00b6 81} \u201c(3) If the drug involved in the violation is marihuana or a compound, mixture, preparation, or substance containing marihuana other than hashish, whoever violates division (A) of this section is guilty <em>of </em>trafficking in marihuana.

If the amount of the drug involved is within that range and if the offense was committed in the vicinity of a school or in the vicinity of a juvenile, trafficking in marihuana is a felony of the third degree, and division (C) of section 2929.13 of the Revised Code applies in determining whether to impose a prison term on the offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-14\">{\u00b6 84} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b849-15\">{\u00b6 85} \u201c(4) If the drug involved in the violation is cocaine or a compound, mixture, preparation, or substance containing cocaine, whoever violates division (A) of this section is guilty of trafficking in cocaine.

If the amount of the drug involved is within one of those ranges and if the offense was committed in the vicinity of a school or in the vicinity of a juvenile, trafficking in cocaine is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>felony of the first degree, and the court shall impose as a mandatory prison term one of the prison terms prescribed for a felony of the first degree.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">{\u00b6 88} In <em>State v. Johnson </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 240, 754 N.E.2d 796, syllabus, the Supreme Court of Ohio held:</p>\n<p id=\"b850-6\">{\u00b6 89} \u201cTo support a conviction for complicity by aiding and abetting pursuant to R.C. 2923.03(A)(2), the evidence must show that the defendant supported, assisted, encouraged, cooperated with, advised, or incited the principal in the commission of the crime, and that the defendant shared the criminal intent of the principal. Such intent may be inferred from the circumstances surrounding the crime.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b850-7\">{\u00b6 90} This court has examined Ohio cases where the reviewing court has found sufficient evidence to support a conviction for complicity to drug trafficking. In <em>State v. McGowan, </em>7th Dist. No. 04 JE 6, 2005-Ohio-1335, 2005 WL 678634, the court upheld a conviction where the defendant was driving the drug dealer and, due to a change in location, charged an extra $10 out of the total drug transaction for the extra driving. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 21. Similarly, in <em>State v. Anderson, </em>12th Dist. No. CA2008-07-026, 2009-Ohio-2521, 2009 WL 1515370, the defendant was driving a vehicle in which cocaine and crack cocaine were found. The court found that there was sufficient evidence to support her conviction when testimony was presented to show that she was aware of the drugs in the vehicle and that when stopped by police, she attempted to conceal them. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 30. See <em>State v. Tapp, </em>5th Dist. No. 2006-CAA-090058, 2007-Ohio-2959, 2007 WL 1720501 (sufficient evidence was presented showing that the passenger in a vehicle assisted the seller by making telephone calls and got into the buyer\u2019s vehicle).</p>\n<p id=\"b850-8\">{\u00b6 91} Conversely, in <em>State v. Jordan, </em>168 Ohio App.3d 202, 2006-Ohio-538, 859 N.E.2d 563, the court vacated a drug-trafficking conviction, finding that the evidence was insufficient. In <em>Jordan, </em>a confidential informant approached the defendant in a convenience store. The two spoke briefly and left the store. The defendant stood by while the confidential informant purchased drugs from a man standing outside. The court concluded that because there was no evidence as to what the defendant and the confidential informant discussed in the store, there was nothing to support the assertion that the defendant somehow assisted in the sale. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 12. See also <em>State v. Stephens, </em>8th Dist. No. 92430, 2009-Ohio-6305, 2009 WL 4406128 (evidence insufficient to support a conviction for aiding and abetting an attempted murder); <em>State v. Buelow, </em>10th Dist. Nos. 07AP-317 and 07AP-318, 2007-Ohio-5929, 2007 WL 3257247 (insufficient evidence to support a theft conviction where the defendant merely accompanied the thief).</p>\n<p id=\"b850-9\">{\u00b6 92} In the present case, the following testimony was presented as to the charges of complicity to trafficking cocaine and marijuana. First, the victim\u2019s sister stated that on March 10, 2008, Gipson told her that he had marijuana in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>trunk of his car. The victim\u2019s mother, Queen Amison, testified that she was \u201csomewhat\u201d familiar with the relationship between her son and Gipson. Amison testified that on March 11, 2008, the victim came to her house and retrieved $8,000 that she was holding for him. Amison testified that her son told her that he knew an individual who had some \u201ckeys,\u201d meaning cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">{\u00b6 93} The victim\u2019s neighbor, Rhonda Farris, testified that she was in the victim\u2019s apartment on March 11, 2008. Farris stated that she observed two stacks of bills totaling $20,000. Farris stated that she knew he was going to make a drug transaction that day and that he dealt only with crack cocaine. Farris had not met any of the victim\u2019s suppliers.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">{\u00b6 94} Finally, Sandusky Police Sergeant John Orzech testified regarding the street value of cocaine. Orzech testified that for $20,000 an individual could buy anywhere from a half to a full kilo of cocaine (more than 100 grams). Orzech stated that a pound of marijuana (453 grams) would cost about $1,000. According to Orzech, through their investigation police learned that Gipson was bringing a pound of marijuana to Sandusky to sell. Orzech testified that the victim\u2019s home was within 1,000 feet of school property.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-7\">{\u00b6 95} Orzech further testified that at the crime scene they recovered a digital scale and Pyrex dish, items that are often used during drug transactions. There was also testimony regarding multiple phone calls between Gipson and the victim leading up to the murder. It is undisputed that no drugs or money were ever recovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-8\">{\u00b6 96} Upon review of the evidence presented at trial, we find that it was insufficient to establish the elements of the crimes beyond a reasonable doubt. As set forth above, a defendant\u2019s presence at the crime does not, without more, impute the criminal intent of the principal to the defendant. Appellant was placed at the scene, but there was no evidence that he was involved in the alleged drug transaction. Gipson was a known drug dealer. He allegedly had the drugs in his vehicle and spoke with the victim multiple times. There is no evidence that appellant had control over the drugs or participated in setting up the alleged transaction with the victim. In addition to the fact that no drugs were recovered, the amount of the drugs, as charged in the indictment, was purely speculative. Appellant\u2019s fifth assignment of error is well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-9\">{\u00b6 97} In appellant\u2019s sixth assignment of error, he contends that the trial court erred by failing to merge the gun specifications for aggravated murder and aggravated robbery. In response, the state concedes that the specifications should have been merged. Appellant will be resentenced as to the gun specifications. Appellant\u2019s sixth assignment of error is well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>{\u00b6 98} In appellant\u2019s seventh and final assignment of error, he argues that he was denied the effective assistance of trial counsel. To prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, a defendant must prove two elements: \u201cFirst, the defendant must show that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient. This requires showing that counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the \u2018counsel\u2019 guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment. Second, the defendant must show that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense.\u201d <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674. Proof of prejudice requires a showing \u201cthat there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 694; <em>State v. Bradley </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 538 N.E.2d 373, paragraph three of the syllabus. Further, debatable strategic and tactical decisions may not form the basis of a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>State v. Phillips </em>(1995), 74 Ohio St.3d 72, 85, 656 N.E.2d 643.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">{\u00b6 99} In this assignment of error, appellant argues that trial counsel was ineffective by failing to raise a Crim.R. 29 motion as to the charges of complicity to trafficking in marijuana and cocaine and when counsel failed to object to the court\u2019s failure to merge the gun specifications at sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-6\">{\u00b6 100} At the close of the state\u2019s case-in-chief, appellant\u2019s counsel did make a Crim.R. 29 motion for acquittal as to all the counts. Counsel did, however, focus on the aggravated-murder charge and, specifically, the \u201cprior calculation and design\u201d element. We cannot say that counsel\u2019s failure to argue the drug charges was constitutionally ineffective. Counsel was aware that the murder conviction would result in a sentence of life imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-7\">{\u00b6 101} Reviewing counsel\u2019s performance before and during the trial, counsel filed several pretrial motions and participated in multiple oral hearings. Counsel also made numerous objections during the trial and vigorously cross-examined the state\u2019s witnesses. Because it was plain error, counsel\u2019s failure to object to the error at sentencing did not, ultimately, prejudice appellant who, is serving a life term. Appellant\u2019s seventh assignment of error is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-8\">{\u00b6 102} On consideration whereof, we find that appellant was prejudiced and prevented from having a fair trial. Appellant\u2019s convictions for complicity to trafficking in cocaine and complicity to trafficking in marijuana are vacated. The matter is remanded for resentencing in accordance with this decision. Pursuant to App.R. 24, the state is ordered to pay the costs of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-9\">Judgment affirmed in part and reversed in part, and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b853-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>Singer, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b853-5\">Yarbrough, J., concurs in part and dissents in part.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b853-6\">Yarbrough, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"ANf\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-7\">{\u00b6 103} I concur in the majority\u2019s opinion and judgment regarding the disposition of the first, second, fifth, and sixth assigned errors. I respectfully dissent, however, regarding the third assigned error. For the reasons that follow, I would find the third assignment well taken and reverse and remand this case for a new trial on the aggravated-murder and aggravated-robbery charges. That disposition would render the fourth and seventh assignments moot. App.R. 12(A)(1)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b853-8\">{\u00b6 104} The third assignment raises a critical hearsay issue having two components: first, the correct admissibility analysis for certain out-of-court statements not offered for their truth and, second, if the statements are admitted for a nonhearsay purpose, the proponent\u2019s use of those statements during trial. Further, in reviewing the third assignment as a hearsay issue, I find it unnecessary to address appellant\u2019s constitutional arguments under <em>Bruton </em>and its federal and Ohio progeny. It is sufficient to review the disputed statements here under the standards that the Tenth Appellate District currently applies to the class of extrajudicial statements offered to explain police conduct during a criminal investigation. The <em>Bruton </em>issue need not be reached because exclusion follows from a hearsay analysis involving the derivative use of Evid.R. 403(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b853-9\">{\u00b6 105} The core facts are relatively few. The disputed hearsay statements originated from appellant\u2019s nontestifying co-defendant, Gipson. In the course of their murder and robbery investigation, the officers had located and questioned Gipson first. From him they learned about a second suspect involved in the crimes, possibly the shooter, who had traveled with Gipson to Sandusky, Ohio, on the day before the murder. This suspect was known only by his sobriquet, \u201cPeanut.\u201d It was his identity the officers were attempting to ascertain when Gipson accompanied them by car to Detroit.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-10\">{\u00b6 106} At trial, Officer Steckel testified that as they drove along a particular street, Gipson pointed out a residence where Peanut was believed to be. Over objection, Steckel related that as they passed the residence, Gipson pointed to an individual standing in front and stated, \u201cThat\u2019s Peanut.\u201d Over further objection, Steckel testified that once back at the police station, Gipson confirmed that appellant was Peanut when shown appellant\u2019s photograph, stating, \u201cThat\u2019s him.\u201d In responding to these objections, the prosecutor represented that Gipson\u2019s out-of-court statements were not being offered for their substantive truth (i.e., to prove that appellant was \u201cPeanut\u201d), but merely to explain the officers\u2019 actions in hunting for the second suspect. The trial court overruled the objections, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>instructed the jury that the purpose of the testimony recounting Gipson\u2019s statements was \u201cto describe this officer and that department\u2019s investigation.\u201d The photograph was later used in a photo array from which three other witnesses identified appellant. These witnesses testified at trial while Gipson did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">(1) Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">{\u00b6 107} The applicable standard for reviewing challenged hearsay is not \u201cabuse of discretion.\u201d While there is discretion to admit or exclude relevant evidence, there is no \u201cdiscretion\u201d to admit hearsay. <em>State v. Sutorius </em>(1997), 122 Ohio App.3d 1, 7, 701 N.E.2d 1; <em>State v. Sorrels </em>(1991), 71 Ohio App.3d 162, 593 N.E.2d 313. In <em>Sorrels, </em>the First Appellate District delineated the correct standard, stating:</p>\n<p id=\"b854-7\">{\u00b6 108} \u201c[T]he trial court\u2019s decision to admit hearsay is not governed by the test of abuse of discretion, which the Supreme Court applies to instances where the trial court\u2019s evidentiary rulings relate to matters expressly or implicitly within its discretion, as in rulings on relevancy (Evid.R. 402 and 403) or expert testimony (Evid.R. 702). * * * Instead, errors relating to the trial court\u2019s admission of hearsay must be reviewed in light of Evid.R. 103(A) and the standard established in Crim.R. 52(A), providing that such errors are harmless unless the record demonstrates that the errors affected a party\u2019s substantial right.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 165.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-9\">{\u00b6 109} Thus, on appeal, challenged hearsay is subject to de novo review under the applicable hearsay rule (or its exceptions), rather than the more deferential review employed for discretionary rulings. <em>Id. </em>In <em>State v. Kidder </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 279, 513 N.E.2d 311, the Ohio Supreme Court established the standard for appellate courts to employ in criminal cases for assessing the effect of improperly admitted hearsay: \u201cIn the final analysis, the evidence in favor of conviction, absent the hearsay, must be so overwhelming that the admission of those statements was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 284.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-10\">(2) Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b854-11\">{\u00b6 110} Evid.R. 801(C) defines \u201chearsay\u201d as \u201ca statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d Hearsay is inadmissible under Evid.R. 802, unless a particular statement fails to meet the two-part definition in Evid.R. 801(C), fully satisfies the conditions for nonhearsay prior statements under Evid.R. 801(D)(1) or (2), or falls within one of recognized exceptions under Evid.R. 803 or 804. Under the hearsay rule, Gipson\u2019s disputed statements were functionally indistinguishable from those of the paradigm out-of-court declarant.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>{\u00b6 111} Generally, when the facts to be proven at trial and the substantive content of an out-of-court statement coincide, it can be presumed that the proponent is offering the statement for its truth. Facially, therefore, it meets the two-part hearsay definition. If, however, the statement is explicitly offered without reference to its truth, then under Evid.R. 801(C) it is not hearsay. <em>State v. Lewis </em>(1970), 22 Ohio St.2d 125, 132-133, 258 N.E.2d 445; <em>State v. Clay, </em>187 Ohio App.3d 633, 2010-Ohio-2720, 933 N.E.2d 296, \u00b6 27. The statement\u2019s admissibility is then evaluated by the standard of relevancy balanced against unfair prejudice, which is the province of Evid.R. 403(A). See <em>State v. Maurer </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 239, 263, 473 N.E.2d 768. If germane for some valid nonhearsay purpose (e.g., to prove notice, to show the declarant\u2019s state of mind, etc.), the statement typically would be admissible for that purpose. See, <em>e.g., State v. Rice, </em>11th Dist. No. 09-A-0034, 2010-Ohio-1638, 2010 WL 1444519, \u00b6 22; <em>State v. Hawthorne, </em>6th Dist. L-03-1120, 2005-Ohio-1553, 2005 WL 736994, \u00b6 35-37.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">{\u00b6 112} However, admissibility is not automatic in the case of a \u201cdual use\u201d statement. This is an out-of-court statement having an ostensibly nonsubstantive use, but whose content carries substantive import because it relates to an element of the crime or implicates the defendant directly. This problem frequently arises during a police officer\u2019s testimony relating what he learned from victims or witnesses while investigating a crime. Despite a professed nonhearsay use, if the statement\u2019s content could also cut toward proof of guilt, the risk of prejudicial misuse is great. See <em>State v. Blanton, </em>184 Ohio App.3d 611, 2009-Ohio-5334, 921 N.E.2d 1103, \u00b6 38-39, and <em>State v. Blevins </em>(1987), 36 Ohio App.3d 147, 149-150, 521 N.E.2d 1105.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">{\u00b6 113} This risk was well described by the Tenth Appellate District. \u201c[W]here statements are offered into evidence to explain an officer\u2019s conduct during the course of investigating a crime, such statements are generally not hearsay. * * * There are limits, however, to this general rule because of the great potential for abuse and potential confusion to the trier of fact. * * * <em>For example, a prosecutor may attempt to use a police officer\u2019s testimony regarding his investigative activities as a pretext to introduce highly prejudicial out-of-court statements, while claiming the statements are being offered merely to explain the police officer\u2019s conduct, rather than for their truth.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>State v. Humphrey, </em>10th Dist. No. 07AP-837, 2008-Ohio-6302, 2008 WL 5104775, \u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-7\">(3) <em>Blevins-Blanton </em>rules for statements offered \u201cto explain police conduct\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b855-8\">{\u00b6 114} In <em>Blevins, </em>cited by the majority, the Tenth District held that because out-of-court statements purportedly offered to explain police conduct carry the potential for abuse, two requirements must be met before admitting them: first, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>\u201c[t]he conduct to be explained should be relevant, equivocal and contemporaneous with the statements. * * * [Second], <em>such statements must meet the standard of Evid.R. 403(A).\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>Id., </em>36 Ohio App.3d at 149, 521 N.E.2d 1105. For extrajudicial statements of this type, the last requirement \u2014 assessment under Evid.R. 403(A) \u2014 is critical. The trial court must consider whether the risk that the jury will prejudicially misuse the substantive content for its truth exceeds the probative value of the statement for the nonhearsay purpose. <em>Blanton </em>at \u00b6 39; <em>Humphrey </em>at \u00b6 11; <em>Blevins </em>at 149-150. In other words, the court must look carefully at the statement\u2019s substantive content, find it to be innocuous or, at best, only minimally prejudicial, and conclude that the danger of prejudice does not substantially outweigh the statement\u2019s probative value \u201cto explain conduct.\u201d Evid.R. 403(A). See <em>State v. Sinkfield </em>(Oct. 2, 1998), 2d Dist. No. 16277, 1998 WL 677413. If the court admits the statement after this weighing, an appropriate limiting instruction must be given to the jury. <em>Blevins </em>at 150; Evid.R. 105.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">{\u00b6 115} The majority cites <em>Blevins </em>for its conclusion that the nonhearsay use of Gipson\u2019s statements to explain the investigating officers\u2019 actions rendered them admissible. However, in <em>Blanton, </em>the Tenth District expanded on <em>Blevins </em>by adding a third requirement for statements offered to explain police conduct, holding:</p>\n<p id=\"b856-6\">{\u00b6 116} \u201cSpecifically, the conduct to be explained must be relevant, equivocal, and contemporaneous with the statements.* * * Further, the statements must meet the standard of Evid.R. 403(A). <em>Id. Finally, \u2018when the </em>statements connect the accused with the crime charged, they should generally be excluded.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Blanton </em>at \u00b6 38-39, quoting <em>Humphrey, </em>2008-Ohio-6302, 2008 WL 5104775, \u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-7\">{\u00b6 117} Carefully comparing the nature of the hearsay statements admitted in <em>Blevins </em>to those excluded in <em>Blanton </em>reveals why the Tenth District adopted a rule of presumptive inadmissibility for statements that \u201cconnect the accused with the crime.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b856-8\">{\u00b6 118} In <em>Blevins, </em>36 Ohio App.3d 147, 521 N.E.2d 1105, the court found that the offered statements met the first requirement: \u201cDetective Kerins related at trial that [the hearsay declarant] Dyer made a phone call.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 149. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>purpose of the call was to set up a drug buy, with undercover officers posing as the buyers. Thus, \u201cDyer\u2019s statements in this regard aided in giving definite character to Detective Kerins actions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As to the second requirement, there was little or no parroting of the <em>content </em>of Dyer\u2019s statements. Their substantive value was, at best, only minimally prejudicial. This led the Tenth District to conclude that \u201cDyer\u2019s statements neither implicated nor cleared defendant.\u201d He \u201cmade a phone call\u201d and \u201c[t]he statements merely described * * * how the detectives met the defendant.\u201d In other words, the second requirement for admitting Dyer\u2019s out-of-court statements \u2014 the weighing of relevancy against prejudice under Evid.R. 403(A) \u2014 was satisfied. See also <em>State v. Wilson, </em>5th Dist. No. 09-CA-44, 2010-Ohio-1394, 2010 WL 1234447, \u00b6 22 (The statement \u201coffered to explain Mr. Moneypenny\u2019s reason for not letting appellant into the house was not unfairly prejudicial. The statement was offered merely to explain Mr. Moneypenny\u2019s behavior [in keeping him out]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">{\u00b6 119} In <em>Blanton, </em>184 Ohio App.3d 611, 2009-Ohio-5334, 921 N.E.2d 1103, the defendant, a registered sex offender, was convicted of failing to provide notice to the Franklin County Sheriffs Department that he had changed his address from the motel where he previously resided. At trial, instead of calling the motel\u2019s employees to testify from personal knowledge about the time and duration of the defendant\u2019s stay at the motel and about the substance of various motel receipts, the prosecutor presented this information through the hearsay testimony of the investigating officers. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 41-42. The <em>Blanton </em>court found reversible error in allowing the officers to repeat to the jury the substance of their conversations with motel personnel regarding the defendant\u2019s actions and whereabouts. The out-of-court statements carried substantive import that went <em>beyond </em>the asserted purpose of \u201cexplaining conduct\u201d; instead, the contents carried proof of the elements of the crime: \u201c[They] described the fact that [the defendant] had moved and the specific date upon which [he] moved.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 43. In assessing the remaining evidence, absent the hearsay, the court found that it was not so overwhelming that the error in admitting the statements was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 49.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-6\">(4) Applying the <em>Blevins-Blanton </em>requirements to the facts sub judice</p>\n<p id=\"b857-7\">{\u00b6 120} When applied here to the police conduct \u201cto be explained,\u201d I find that the first requirement of <em>Blevins </em>was met. Officer Steckel\u2019s initial testimony about his (and the other officers\u2019) actions in seeking to identify a second murder suspect with the street name \u201cPeanut,\u201d was plainly relevant. <em>Blevins, </em>36 Ohio App.3d at 149, 521 N.E.2d 1105. Without some reference to Gipson\u2019s presence to provide context and meaning, their actions in going to a particular residence in Detroit would appear \u201cequivocal,\u201d in that it might be unclear to the jury why the officers went there in the first place. There is also no question that Gipson\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>statements, when made, were \u201ccontemporaneous\u201d with the investigating conduct and yice versa.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-4\">{\u00b6 121} The critical question pertains instead to Blevins\u2019s second admissibility-proviso requiring an Evid.R. 403(A) assessment: whether repeating the statement\u2019s substantive content to the jury was substantially more prejudicial than probative, because in doing so here, that content <em>connected appellant to the </em>crimes.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Blanton </em>at \u00b6 39. While hearsay may cease to be an issue when the statement of an out-of-court declarant is not offered for its truth, the issue of relevancy balanced against unfair prejudice remains. <em>State v. Maurer, </em>15 Ohio St.3d at 263, 473 N.E.2d 768.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">{\u00b6 122} Where I believe the majority errs is in its assessment of the substantive content of Gipson\u2019s statements when compared with those at issue in <em>Blevins.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b858-6\">{\u00b6 123} In this case, testimony had already established that there were two suspects in the robbery and murder of Calvin Harper Jr., one of whom went by the street name \u201cPeanut.\u201d Gipson\u2019s out-of-court statements were statements <em>identifying </em>the second suspect. Unlike the innocuous hearsay in <em>Blevins, </em>Steck-el\u2019s testimony repeating Gipson\u2019s statements went substantially beyond \u201cexplaining conduct.\u201d Indeed, the statements directly connected appellant to the crimes, essentially telling the jury that he was Gipson\u2019s partner in robbery and murder.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> But for Gipson\u2019s identification, there would have been no investigatory link to the second criminal actor. It led to the subsequent photo array from which three witnesses (Farris, Harper, and Poole) further identified appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-7\">{\u00b6 124} In applying the <em>Blevins-Blanton </em>rules to this case, the most persuasive precedent on similar facts is <em>State v. Sinkfield </em>(Oct. 2, 1998), 2d Dist. No. 16277, 1998 WL 677413, involving a robbery and murder with multiple victims, in which the Second Appellate District reached the same conclusion I do. There, the disputed hearsay statement was also one of identification, but instead of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>source being a nontestifying co-defendant, the identification came from an anonymous tip that Dayton police received from a \u201cCrime Stoppers\u201d program. <em>Id. </em>As here, the investigating detective used the tip to assemble a photo array from which two victims identified Sinkfield. At trial, as here, the prosecutor defeated a hearsay objection by asserting that the out-of-court statement comprising the tip was not offered for its truth, but \u201cmerely to explain why Detective Pearson included Sinkfield\u2019s photograph in a photo spread shown to [the victims].\u201d <em>Id. </em>In analyzing the substantive content of the statement, the Second District held:</p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">{\u00b6 125} \u201c[T]he conduct * * * sought to be explained was [Detective Pearson\u2019s] act of placing Sinkfield\u2019s photograph in the photo spread shown to [victim] J.B. Although Detective Pearson\u2019s conduct was relevant and contemporaneous with the out-of-court statement admitted, i.e., that Sinkfield was the other suspect involved in the incident, it is doubtful that Detective Pearson\u2019s act of placing Sinkfield\u2019s photograph in the photo spread was so equivocal or ambiguous <em>that it needed to be explained to the jury through the use of the out-of-court statement. Furthermore, the probative value of the out-of-court statement was substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, since the statement identified Sinkfield as the other suspect in the incident </em>[citing <em>Blevins </em>]. * * * Additionally, there was no reason for the prosecutor to have Detective Pearson explain why he placed Sinkfield\u2019s photograph in the photo spread shown to J.B. Both J.B. and Byrdsong already had testified that Sinkfield was one of the participants in the robbery and shootings, and J.B. related how he had identified Sinkfield from the photo spread shown to him by Detective Pearson on February 5,1996. <em>Thus, it appears that the prosecutor\u2019s primary purpose in eliciting Detective Pearson\u2019s testimony regarding [the content of] the anonymous tip was for the truth of the matter being asserted therein and not to explain Detective Pearson\u2019s actions.* </em>* * This conclusion is further confirmed by the fact that, <em>during his closing argument, the prosecutor tried to use the anonymous tip as substantive proof of Sinkfield\u2019s guilt.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b859-6\">{\u00b6 126} I would therefore find that the trial court erred in permitting Officer Steckel, under the guise of \u201cexplaining conduct,\u201d to repeat the content of Gipson\u2019s statements identifying appellant. The content of those statements, in my view, was substantially more prejudicial than probative (Blevins) and despite the limiting instruction, they directly connected appellant to the crimes charged <em>{Blanton). </em>Notwithstanding that error, however, the record also reveals a second error that merely compounded the first. It stems from the same prosecutorial conduct cited by the <em>Sinkfield </em>court in the last sentence of the above-quoted passage.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>(5) Misuse of extrajudicial statements admitted for a nonhearsay purpose</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">{\u00b6 127} The trial transcript indicates that in closing argument the prosecutor employed Steckel\u2019s testimony about Gipson\u2019s identification for its <em>substantive truth. </em>Permitting this was the second error. See <em>State v. Kirk, </em>6th Dist. No. H-09-006, 2010-Ohio-2006, 2010 WL 1818894, \u00b6 28; <em>State v. Ramos-Aquino, </em>10th Dist. No. 09AP-975, 2010-Ohio-2732, 2010 WL 2395776, \u00b6 13. Once an out-of-court statement has been admitted for a purpose other than the truth of its content, the content may not be used or relied upon later as <em>substantive proof </em>(i.e., for the truth of what it asserts).</p>\n<p id=\"b860-6\">{\u00b6 128} In <em>State v. Kirk, </em>we admonished this same switch-of-purpose tactic for otherwise inadmissible hearsay and held it to be prosecutorial misconduct. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 29-33 (\u201cThe prosecutor essentially gave the jurors permission to use the hearsay statements as substantive evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 33). We found reversible error where the prosecutor, in closing argument, \u201creferred to testimony which she [had] expressly claim[ed] to have offered not for its truth, but to explain subsequent actions taken by the detectives.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 29. In <em>Kirk, </em>an investigating detective had been permitted to testify to several out-of-court statements from a confidential informant. The prosecutor elicited these statements purportedly to explain how the detective\u2019s investigation developed. Yet, when their actual use was viewed collectively, the statements \u201cwere offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted in them [and demonstrate] appellant\u2019s guilt by connecting him to a known drug dealer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 19-22. Their substantive use during the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument went \u201cfar beyond\u201d the limited explanatory purpose for which the statements were initially allowed. <em>Id. </em>This court held:</p>\n<p id=\"b860-7\">{\u00b6 129} \u201cThe prosecutor has now relied on extrajudicial statements for their truth \u2014 statements which she maintained during trial were not offered for their truth \u2014 as evidence that appellant brought the crack cocaine from Akron into Willard. The prosecutor\u2019s remarks were improper and argued beyond the record.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 29.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b860-8\">{\u00b6 130} In <em>Sinkfield, </em>the Second District reached essentially the same conclusion, holding:</p>\n<p id=\"b860-9\">{\u00b6 131} \u201c[W]hile the trial court admitted [Detective Pearson\u2019s testimony] for a very limited purpose, the prosecutor either did not understand the limited purpose for which the anonymous tip was being admitted or simply chose to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>ignore it. Indeed, later on in his closing argument, <em>the prosecutor brazenly used the anonymous tip for its truth when he told the jury, \u2018You know everything J.B. told you about identification is substantiated by information received from Crime Stoppers when he [Pearson] got the photo spread together[.]\u2019 </em>* * * [This is] compelling evidence that <em>the prosecutor\u2019s prima,ry motivation in introducing the testimony regarding the anonymous tip was for its truth, and not to explain Detective Pearson\u2019s subsequent action. * </em>* * In light of the foregoing, the trial court abused its discretion by <em>not excluding as hearsay Detective Pearson\u2019s testimony regarding the anonymous tip received from Crime Stoppers, stating that Sinkfield was the other suspect in the incident.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">{\u00b6 132} Here, the error in admitting Gipson\u2019s statements through Officer Steckel\u2019s testimony was exacerbated when the prosecutor later improperly referenced them for their truth. The impact of prosecutorial misconduct, however, \u201cmust be considered in the light of the whole case\u201d and is not a basis for reversal \u201cunless that conduct deprives the defendant of a fair trial.\u201d <em>Maurer, </em>15 Ohio St.3d at 266, 473 N.E.2d 768. As well, the impact of the erroneously admitted hearsay is determined by the <em>Kidder </em>standard. <em>Kidder, </em>32 Ohio St.3d at 284, 513 N.E.2d 311. Where both occur, the standards for improperly admitted hearsay and misconduct are combined to evaluate whether the errors were harmless in view of the remaining evidence. See <em>Kirk, </em>2010-Ohio-2006, 2010 WL 1818894, at \u00b6 34-35.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-6\">{\u00b6 133} As the majority decision details, three witnesses identified appellant from a photo array. One of them (Farris) specifically identified him as the man who mistakenly came to her door shortly before the murder. Although appellant\u2019s first and second assignments challenged as unreliable this identification evidence and the procedures employed to obtain it, I agree they are not well taken for the reasons expressed in the majority decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-7\">{\u00b6 134} However, the testimony of these witnesses established only appellant\u2019s <em>presence </em>in the neighborhood on the day of the crimes, whereas the content of Gipson\u2019s statements involved him directly <em>in </em>the crimes. The statements were, moreover, facially incriminating, given the source. In using them in closing argument, the prosecutor was not merely summarizing what the investigating officers did, or where they went, or why. He was suggesting that the jury infer guilt from Gipson having identified appellant as \u201cPeanut,\u201d thereby using Officer Steckel\u2019s testimony about what Gipson said for its truth value, precisely contrary to the basis on which it was admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-8\">{\u00b6 135} In assessing the effect of this testimony, and despite the limiting instruction, I cannot say conclusively that the jury focused <em>only </em>on the other witnesses\u2019 testimony to support the conviction. Indeed, there is more than a reasonable possibility that the erroneously admitted hearsay \u2014 and its misuse\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>contributed to appellant\u2019s murder and robbery convictions. Therefore, I would find the third assignment of error well taken, reverse the judgment of conviction on those charges, and remand the case for a new trial consistent with this opinion on the hearsay issue.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b856-9\">. A limiting instruction is particularly critical when the statement\u2019s content might imply guilt. It is the court's instruction that operates to contain the statement to its nonhearsay character and function. See Weissenberger, Ohio Evidence Treatise (2010), Section 801.10. See also <em>State </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>8th Dist. No. 85662, 2006-Ohio-5902, 2006 WL 3233895, \u00b6 28-29 (limiting instruction to jury creates presumption it was followed). However, as recognized in <em>Blanton, </em>the incriminating content of some out-of-court statements is so inherently prejudicial that no instruction could effectively restrict the jury\u2019s use of them to the explanatory purpose.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b858-8\">. If an officer's investigative steps can be summarized in a way that does not impart to the jury the prejudicial content of the out-of-court statement, then <em>Blevins\u2019 </em>s second requirement, and the third added in <em>Blanton, </em>arguably can be satisfied. It is the <em>officer's behavior </em>that is relevant, not the content of the statement. Otherwise, the statement's substance <em>is </em>being used for its truth, which renders it inadmissible hearsay. As suggested in <em>Blevins, </em>the potential prejudice that arises from repeating the content could be minimized by an officer's foundational testimony that avoids it, e.g., \"[during my investigation] I came to know [Mr. Ricks] through my contact with [Mr. Gipson].\" See <em>id.., 36 </em>Ohio App.3d at 149, 521 N.E.2d 1105, fn. 1. In <em>Blanton, </em>the Tenth District found that the extrajudicial statements there \"were offered to demonstrate appellant\u2019s guilt,\" because the \"repetition of the detailed\u201d contents \"undeniably connected [him] with the crime charged.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 43.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b858-9\">. To some extent, the trial court's limiting instruction here sought to minimize the risk of prejudicial misuse by the jury, although I note the Tenth District in <em>Blanton </em>was plainly unconvinced by a similar cautionary instruction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b860-10\">. We also stated in <em>Kirk, </em>2010-Ohio-2006, 2010 WL 1818894, that \"[i]f a statement made by an out-of-court declarant is offered into evidence for a purpose other than asserting the truth of its content, then <em>the content is not substantive evidence. </em>* * * <em>A prosecutor must not later assert those statements for their truth during closing argument.'' </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 28.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
