Humberto, appeals from a judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas finding him guilty, pursuant to jury verdict, of two counts of murder in violation of R.C. 2903.02, one count of attempted murder in violation of R.C. 2923.02 as it relates to R.C. 2903.02, and one count of felonious assault in violation of R.C. 2903.11, all with firearm specifications pursuant to R.C. 2941.145. Because (1) legally sufficient evidence and the manifest weight of the evidence support defendant\u2019s convictions, (2) the trial court did not commit plain error in allowing gang-related testimony into evidence, and (3) the trial court did not err in allowing pretrial identifications of defendant into evidence, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-10\">I. Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b271-11\">{\u00b6 2} The state indicted defendant on December 29, 2008, on (1) two counts of murder, one for purposely causing the death of Ramon Ramos, and the other for causing the death of Ramon Ramos as a proximate result of committing or attempting to commit felonious assault, (2) one count of attempting to purposely cause the death of Angel Devilbiss, and (3) one count of felonious assault for knowingly causing serious physical harm or attempting to cause physical harm by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>means of a deadly weapon to Angel Devilbiss. The charges arose from a shooting incident that occurred on November 15, 2008, at a bar called \u201cEl Gato Negro,\u201d located in Columbus, Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">{\u00b6 3} According to the state\u2019s evidence, Ramon Ramos, his brother Wilmer Ramos, Wilmer\u2019s wife Angel Devilbiss, and the Ramoses\u2019 cousin, Wilson Guillen, went to El Gato Negro around 10:30 p.m. to pick up Guillen\u2019s brother, who was having problems with some members of a gang known as MS-13. When the group arrived at the bar, they noticed a man they did not know who was staring at them in such a way as to make them uncomfortable. An individual, whose street name was \u201cMomia\u201d and who was known to the Ramos group from the soccer fields, where he had attempted to initiate fights with them, began to joust verbally with Ramon shortly after the Ramos group arrived. Momia suggested that the men take the fight outside, and as Ramon turned to walk outside, another individual from Momia\u2019s group hit Ramon over the head with a pool stick. In retaliation, Wilmer picked up one of the pool balls and threw it at Momia and his group. The bouncer from the bar, Edward Pyfrom, intervened and forced everyone outside.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">{\u00b6 4} With Momia behind them, the Ramos group began walking to their cars to leave. When an unidentified man tried to intervene, Momia and his group assaulted the man. At that point, another man came from a car, walked towards the Ramos group, and with arms outstretched shot a gun at them. After firing several shots, the shooter and Momia got into the same car and fled the scene. The man with the gun shot Angel Devilbiss\u2019s ring finger, thumb, tailbone, and stomach, as well as Ramon\u2019s head, upper abdomen, and hip; Ramon died from the multiple gunshot wounds he sustained. Wilmer and Wilson both testified that the man who had fired the shots was the same individual who was staring at the Ramos group when they first entered the bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">{\u00b6 5} Shortly after the shooting, police arrived to collect information from the scene. Pyfrom described the suspect to the police as a five-foot-six-inch Hispanic male weighing between 160 and 185 pounds. Wilson gave one of the officers a baseball hat that he said fell off an individual who was involved with the shooting, and police recovered seven spent shell casings from the scene of the incident. On the day after the shooting, a confidential informant working for police turned in to Detective Sandford of the Columbus Division of Police a firearm that she believed was connected to a homicide. Ballistics testing revealed that the firearm was the same firearm used at the shooting. DNA testing on the baseball hat indicated that defendant had not worn the hat. Through several interviews, detectives identified an individual using the street name \u201cColima\u201d as the primary suspect in the case; they subsequently discovered that defendant was Colima.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>{\u00b6 6} Defendant presented no evidence in his defense, and the jury returned verdicts finding him guilty of all counts charged in the indictment. The court imposed on defendant a prison term of 15 years to life on the two counts of murder, noting that they merged for purposes of sentencing. The court further imposed a prison term of four years on the attempted-murder and felonious-assault convictions, again merging them. The court ordered the sentences to be served consecutively and further imposed six years\u2019 imprisonment on the two separate firearm specifications, for a total sentence of 25 years to life.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">II. Assignments of Error</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">{\u00b6 7} Defendant appeals, assigning the following errors:</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">First Assignment of Error</p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">The trial court erred and deprived appellant of due process of law as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article One Section Ten of the Ohio Constitution by finding him guilty of murder, attempted murder, and felonious assault as those verdicts were not supported by sufficient evidence and were also against the manifest weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-9\">Second Assignment of Error</p>\n<p id=\"b273-10\">The trial court erred in permitting the state to introduce improper and prejudicial testimony regarding gang culture, thereby violating appellant\u2019s rights as guaranteed by the Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution and Article I, Sections 2, 10 and 16 of the Ohio Constitution. Third Assignment of Error</p>\n<p id=\"b273-11\">The trial court erred in holding to reveal [sic] the identity and promises made to any confidential informant and motion to suppress identification testimony and to reveal (1) any identification procedures where photographs of defendant were shown to any witnesses, and (2) procedures for how showups and lineups were conducted of the defendant, and (3) to identify any procedures where witnesses were asked to describe any suspects to the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-12\">III. First Assignment of Error \u2014 Sufficiency and Manifest Weight</p>\n<p id=\"b273-13\">{\u00b6 8} Defendant\u2019s first assignment of error challenges the sufficiency and manifest weight of the evidence. Defendant contends that the evidence connecting him to the murder \u201cwas imprecise, circumstantial, and mainly supported by the unreliable testimony of Edward Pyfrom.\u201d Defendant does not dispute that someone fired several shots outside El Gato Negro, seriously injuring Angel Devilbiss and killing Ramon. The issue is the identity of the perpetrator of the offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>{\u00b6 9} Whether evidence is legally sufficient to sustain a verdict is a question of law. <em>State v. Thompkins </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 386, 678 N.E.2d 541. Sufficiency is a test of adequacy. Id. The evidence is construed in the light most favorable to the prosecution to determine whether a rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the offense proven beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Jenks </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 574 N.E.2d 492, paragraph two of the syllabus; <em>State v. Conley </em>(Dec. 16, 1993), 10th Dist. No. 93AP-387, 1993 WL 524917. When reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence, the court does not weigh the credibility of the witnesses. <em>State v. Yarbrough, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 227, 2002-Ohio-2126, 767 N.E.2d 216, \u00b6 79.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">{\u00b6 10} Although no weapon or forensic evidence tied defendant to the shooting, Wilmer, Wilson, and Pyfrom all were present at the scene, saw the shooter, and identified defendant as the shooter. \u201c \u2018Eyewitness identification testimony is sufficient to support a conviction.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Coleman </em>(Nov. 21, 2000), 10th Dist. No. 99AP-1387, 2000 WL 1724817, quoting <em>State v. Artis </em>(May 17, 1994), 10th Dist. No. 93APA11-1547, 1994 WL 194953. Construing the evidence in the light most favorable to the state, sufficient evidence identifies the shooter and supports the jury\u2019s verdicts.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">{\u00b6 11} The manifest weight of the evidence is both \u201cquantitatively and qualitatively different\u201d than the sufficiency of the evidence. <em>Thompkins, </em>78 Ohio St.3d at 386, 678 N.E.2d 541. When presented with a manifest-weight argument, we engage in a limited weighing of evidence to determine whether sufficient competent, credible evidence permits reasonable minds to find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Conley, </em>supra; <em>Thompkins </em>at 387, 678 N.E.2d 541 (noting that \u201c[w]hen a court of appeals reverses a judgment of a trial court on the basis that the verdict is against the weight of the evidence, the appellate court sits as a \u2018 \u201cthirteenth juror\u201d \u2019 and disagrees with the factfinder\u2019s resolution of the conflicting testimony\u201d). In the manifest-weight analysis, the appellate court considers the credibility of the witnesses and determines whether the jury \u201c \u2018clearly lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the conviction must be reversed and a new trial ordered.\u2019 \u201d Id., quoting <em>State v. Martin </em>(1983), 20 Ohio App.3d 172, 175, 485 N.E.2d 717. Determinations of credibility and weight of the testimony remain within the province of the trier of fact. <em>State v. DeHass </em>(1967), 10 Ohio St.2d 230, 227 N.E.2d 212, paragraph one of the syllabus. The jury may take note of any inconsistencies and resolve them accordingly, \u201cbelieving] all, part, or none of a witness\u2019s testimony.\u201d <em>State v. Raver, </em>10th Dist. No. 02AP-604, 2003-Ohio-958, 2003 WL 723225, \u00b6 21, citing <em>State v. Antill </em>(1964), 176 Ohio St. 61, 67, 197 N.E.2d 548.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">{\u00b6 12} In reviewing the \u201cmanifest weight of the evidence, this court frequently has held that, even where discrepancies exist, eyewitness identification testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>alone is sufficient to support a conviction so long as a reasonable juror could find the eyewitness testimony to be credible.\u201d <em>State v. Jordan, </em>10th Dist. No. 04AP-827, 2005-Ohio-3790, 2005 WL 1745319, \u00b6 14. Accordingly, the issue under defendant\u2019s first assignment of error boils down to whether a reasonable juror could have found the testimony of the eyewitnesses to be credible. In that regard, the state relied on the testimony of three witnesses: Wilmer, Wilson, and Pyfrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">{\u00b6 13} Wilmer stated that after the fight between Ramon and Momia spilled out into the parking lot, \u201csomeone came out shooting.\u201d According to Wilmer, the man came from among the cars, walked toward Wilmer\u2019s group, and held the gun with both hands with his arms out straight. Wilmer said that he focused during the shooting \u201con the guy who was shooting at us,\u201d and he \u201ccould see well,\u201d since \u201c[tjhere was overhead light from one of the posts there on the corner and it was near where we were.\u201d Wilmer testified that Momia did not commit the shooting, as he was still kicking the man who tried to intervene when the shooting first began.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">{\u00b6 14} Although Wilmer was emotional and refused to speak to police on the night of the incident, he spoke with police the next day and identified a photograph of Momia. In January 2009, Wilmer identified defendant as the shooter from a photo array, writing in Spanish on the front of the photo array that defendant was the man who had been looking at him and his brother \u201cseriously like if he had something to do with us. And in reality, that\u2019s when he started shooting on me and my wife.\u201d Despite cross-examination suggesting that Wilmer was less than certain of his pick, when the photo array originally was presented to him, Wilmer confirmed at trial that defendant\u2019s photo, picked in the array, was a photo of the person who shot his wife and brother. Wilmer identified defendant, sitting in the courtroom, as the same man who shot at his group on November 15, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">{\u00b6 15} The second of the three pivotal witnesses, Wilson stated that the shooter was inside the bar before the incident, giving him and his cousins bad looks. Wilson testified that as the fight spilled out into the parking lot, the shooter came from the back of a car and walked directly towards his group, holding his arms out straight. Wilson said that although he did not get a \u201creally good\u201d look at the shooter\u2019s face, he \u201csaw his face\u201d and identified defendant in the courtroom as the shooter. Defendant notes that Wilson did not identify defendant to police when he spoke with them on the night of the incident; instead he first identified defendant as the shooter in the courtroom. Wilson explained that he felt no need to call police to tell them he could identify the shooter, because he saw defendant\u2019s picture in the newspaper and concluded that the police already had him in jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>{\u00b6 16} Pyfrom, the third eyewitness and the bouncer, testified that the lighting outside El Gato Negro was \u201creal good. It\u2019s not that bright, but you can still see everything as it come on. You can see the cars, the tags, the license plates and everything as they park there.\u201d Pyfrom stated that he had seen defendant in the bar a couple of times before the incident and specifically recalled kicking defendant out of the bar for violating the dress code approximately one to two weeks prior to the night of the incident. Pyfrom, however, also testified that defendant did not come into the bar on the night of the shooting. Pyfrom was just outside the front entrance of the bar when the shooting occurred, was able to get a clear look at the shooter, and actually saw the fire and smoke come out of the gun. He said that the shooter walked towards the group with his arms straight out, \u201c[s]hooting in to the crowd that was right there.\u201d Because Pyfrom told police on the night of the incident that he would be able to identify the suspect, detectives showed Pyfrom a photo array on December 20, 2008. With no difficulty, Pyfrom identified defendant as the shooter both in the photo array and subsequently in the courtroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">{\u00b6 17} Defendant contends that a reasonable juror could not believe Pyfrom\u2019s testimony because Pyfrom received a sentencing benefit from the state on an unrelated crime. Pyfrom informed the jury that he had two prior felony convictions, was arrested in June 2009 for carrying a concealed weapon, was on probation for a 2005 possession-of-cocaine conviction, and was under indictment for possession of drugs and tampering with evidence. Pyfrom, however, testified that he had no agreement with the state either when he told officers on the night of the incident that he could identify the shooter or when he identified defendant from the photo array a month later.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">{\u00b6 18} Not. until January 13, 2010, did Pyfrom enter into a \u201cDefendant\u2019s Agreement\u201d with the state, agreeing \u201cto testify truthfully, completely, and accurately\u201d regarding the events of November 15, 2008. In return, Pyfrom received a 12-month sentence on the concealed-weapon charge, and his probation under the 2005 case was terminated for time served. The state reserved the right to reinstate the original charges if Pyfrom testified falsely. Defendant on cross-examination asked Pyfrom if he would have testified had the state not offered him any sentencing benefit, and he responded, \u201cI\u2019d still be here.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">{\u00b6 19} Defendant\u2019s cross-examination of the three eyewitnesses may have presented the jury with reasons to question their testimony. The jury, however, had \u201csuperior, first-hand perspective in judging the demeanor and credibility of witnesses.\u201d <em>State v. Mickens, </em>10th Dist. No. 08AP-626, 2009-Ohio-1973, 2009 WL 1142271, \u00b6 30; <em>DeHass, </em>10 Ohio St.2d 230, 227 N.E.2d 212, at paragraph one of the syllabus. It was free to assess their credibility, including Pyfrom\u2019s credibility in light of the consideration he received from the state for testifying for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>prosecution, and determine whether their testimony was credible. <em>State v. Jennings, </em>10th Dist. No. 09AP-70, 2009-Ohio-6840, 2009 WL 5062117, \u00b6 56, citing <em>State v. Bliss, </em>10th Dist. No. 04AP-216, 2005-Ohio-3987, 2005 WL 1840128, \u00b6 26 (concluding that the jury was free to assess the witnesses\u2019 credibility where the details of witnesses\u2019 plea agreement were revealed); <em>State v. Covington, </em>10th Dist. No. 02AP-245, 2002-Ohio-7037, 2002 WL 31839206, \u00b6 28. Nothing in their testimony removed that prerogative from the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">{\u00b6 20} Defendant next contends that the testimony of the three eyewitnesses is not credible because of differences regarding what the shooter wore. Wilson testified that Momia, not the shooter, wore a black hat; Wilmer told police that the shooter had on a black ball cap. Wilmer testified at trial that the shooter wore a white sweatshirt with possibly some black streaks and a hood; Wilson testified that the shooter wore a black and white sweater, like a winter coat, with a hood. Pyfrom testified that the shooter was wearing all black. Sergeant Eggleston testified that although the scene was a well-lit nighttime scene, colors in particular \u201care hard to distinguish at night.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">{\u00b6 21} The discrepancies in the testimony concerning what the shooter wore render neither the witnesses\u2019 testimony incredible nor the verdicts against the manifest weight of the evidence. Three different eyewitnesses identified defendant as the shooter and corroborated the other witnesses\u2019 testimony in some aspects. <em>State v. Monford, </em>190 Ohio App.3d 35, 2010-Ohio-4732, 940 N.E.2d 634, \u00b6 113 (noting that the \u201ceyewitness testimony of the various witnesses corroborated one another\u201d and that the jury could have concluded that \u201cit would be highly unlikely to find that all of the witnesses were not credible\u201d). Any discrepancies were for the jury to resolve in determining which witnesses were credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">{\u00b6 22} Defendant may contend that the darkness impaired the ability of the three witnesses to identify him and rendered their testimony unbelievable, but the witnesses and the police officers testified that visibility was good. Moreover, Wilmer and Wilson saw defendant in the bar earlier that evening, and Pyfrom had seen defendant in the bar a couple of times before the incident, both factors that raise the level of reliability. Id. at \u00b6 113.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">{\u00b6 23} In the end, the jury found Wilmer, Wilson, and Pyfrom credible despite the discrepancies in their testimony and the benefit Pyfrom received in exchange for his testimony. Given that all three witnesses independently identified defendant as the shooter, a reasonable juror could have found the eyewitnesses\u2019 testimony credible. Engaging in the limited weighing of the evidence that we are permitted, we cannot say that the jury clearly lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice as to warrant reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>{\u00b6 24} Because sufficient evidence and the manifest weight of the evidence support defendant\u2019s convictions, we overrule defendant\u2019s first assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">IV. Second Assignment of Error \u2014 Gang-Related Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">{\u00b6 25} Defendant\u2019s second assignment of error argues that the gang-related evidence adduced at trial unfairly prejudiced him, allowing the jury to infer guilt from his alleged association with gang members. A trial court has broad discretion concerning the admission of evidence; in the absence of an abuse of discretion that materially prejudices a defendant, a reviewing court generally will not reverse an evidentiary ruling. <em>State v. Issa </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 49, 64, 752 N.E.2d 904.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">{\u00b6 26} Defendant initially questions the trial court\u2019s allowing Detective Sand-ford to testify as an expert regarding gang-related activity. Defendant contends that even if Sandford was properly qualified to testify as an expert witness, the trial court abdicated its role as the \u201cgatekeeper\u201d of evidence when it allowed Detective Sandford to testify regarding MS-13 without first applying the factors set forth in <em>Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc. </em>(1993), 509 U.S. 579, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469. Defendant further alleges that the trial court erred by allowing portions of Detective Sandford\u2019s testimony into evidence, as they were irrelevant and prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">{\u00b6 27} A witness may testify as an expert when (1) the testimony relates to matters beyond the knowledge laypersons hold, (2) he or she possesses specialized knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education regarding the subject matter of the testimony, and (3) the testimony is based on reliable information. Evid.R. 702(A). As to whether the trial court erred in permitting Sandford to so testify, defendant\u2019s argument is problematic for two reasons: defendant failed to timely object and <em>Daubert </em>does not apply here.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-9\">{\u00b6 28} Although defendant filed a pretrial motion in limine \u201cto prevent any reference whatsoever to MS-13,\u201d the trial court denied the motion. Because defendant failed to object during trial to the testimony that he contends should have been precluded under the motion in limine, he forfeited all but plain error. <em>State v. Maurer </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 239, 259, 473 N.E.2d 768 (noting that \u201c[fjailure to object to evidence at the trial constitutes a waiver of any challenge, regardless of the disposition made for a preliminary motion <em>in limine\u201d); State v. Drummond, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 14, 2006-Ohio-5084, 854 N.E.2d 1038, \u00b6 115, citing Crim.R. 52(B); <em>State v. Hartman </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 274, 286, 754 N.E.2d 1150 (stating that defense \u201ccounsel never objected or challenged his qualifications to testify\u201d and thus \u201cwaived all but plain error\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>{\u00b6 29} Pursuant to Crim.R. 52(B), \u201c[p]lain errors or defects affecting substantial rights may be noticed although they were not brought to the attention of the court.\u201d This rule places three limitations on a reviewing court\u2019s decision to correct an error despite the absence of a timely objection at trial: (1) there must be an error, i.e., a deviation from a legal rule, (2) the error must be plain, so that it constitutes an obvious defect in the trial proceedings, and (3) the error must have affected substantial rights such that the trial court\u2019s error must have affected the outcome of the trial. <em>State v. Barnes </em>(2002), 94 Ohio St.3d 21, 27, 759 N.E.2d 1240. The decision to correct a plain error is discretionary and should be made \u201c \u2018with the utmost caution, under exceptional circumstances and only to prevent a manifest miscarriage of justice.\u2019 \u201d Id., quoting <em>State v. Long </em>(1978), 53 Ohio St.2d 91, 372 N.E.2d 804, paragraph three of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">{\u00b6 30} Moreover, defendant\u2019s contention regarding <em>Daubert </em>is misplaced. In <em>Daubert, </em>the United States Supreme Court held that under the Federal Rules of Evidence, \u201cthe trial judge must ensure that any and all scientific testimony or evidence admitted is not only relevant, but reliable.\u201d Id., 509 U.S. at 589, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469. To that end, the court announced a nonexhaustive list of factors the trial court may consider to determine the reliability of an expert\u2019s testimony, including whether the theory or technique was tested and subject to peer review, the known or potential rate of error, and whether the theory or technique is generally accepted within the scientific community. Id. at 593-595, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469. The same court later recognized that although the trial judge\u2019s gatekeeping obligation applies to all expert testimony, the court should consider the <em>Daubert </em>factors only to the extent relevant to a particular expert\u2019s expertise. <em>Kumho Tire Co., Ltd. v. Carmichael </em>(1999), 526 U.S. 137, 147-149, 119 S.Ct. 1167, 143 L.Ed.2d 238.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">{\u00b6 31} The Supreme Court of Ohio refused to apply the <em>Daubert </em>factors to gang-related testimony. <em>Drummond, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 14, 2006-Ohio-5084, 854 N.E.2d 1038, at \u00b6 119, citing <em>United States v. Hankey </em>(C.A.9, 2000), 203 F.3d 1160, 1169 (noting that the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals \u201crecognized that unlike scientific testimony, expert testimony about gangs depends heavily on the expert\u2019s knowledge and experience rather than on the expert\u2019s methodology and theory\u201d). In addressing Drummond\u2019s contentions about expert testimony on gangs, the court noted that the detective had been a member of the Youngstown Police Department\u2019s gang unit for several years and had gained knowledge and experience \u201cthrough investigating gang activities in the Youngstown area.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 116. The detective thus showed that \u201che possessed specialized knowledge about gang symbols, cultures, and traditions beyond that of the trier of fact.\u201d Id. The court determined that the trial court did not commit plain error in permitting the detective to testify as an expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>{\u00b6 32} Similarly here, Detective Sandford testified he had been a member of the gang unit within the Columbus Division of Police Strategic Response Bureau since 1996, minus a four-year break in which he worked in the bureau as a liaison between the narcotics bureau and the gang unit. Sandford stated that he had received basic gang instruction in the police academy and encountered many gang members in his first eight years as a patrol officer on the near-east side of Columbus. Sandford said that since joining the gang, unit in 1996, he has received specific gang training through attending numerous conferences \u201cboth locally and nationwide * * * where there [was] further instruction on local gangs, on regional gangs, and on national gangs and what the recent trends are.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">{\u00b6 33} Sandford further stated that he specializes in Latino gang activity in Columbus and teaches other law-enforcement officers about Latino gangs in Columbus and central Ohio. According to Sandford, he has specifically investigated MS-13, also known as La Mara Salvatrucha, and explained its identifiers, such as tattoos, clothing, colors, and signs that indicate membership in MS-13. Sandford stated that he had documented the first MS-13 member in Columbus in 1998 and since then has documented over 50 MS-13 members in the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">{\u00b6 34} The testimony demonstrated that Sandford possessed specialized knowledge about MS-13 beyond the trier of fact and was qualified to testify as an expert about MS-13 and gang-related matters. <em>Drummond, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 14, 2006-Ohio-5084, 854 N.E.2d 1038, at \u00b6 116. The trial court did not commit plain error in allowing Sandford to testify as an expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">{\u00b6 35} Defendant lastly contends that the gang testimony was irrelevant, prejudicial, and inflammatory. \u201c \u2018Relevant evidence\u2019 means evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d Evid.R. 401. \u201cIn general, a trial court has discretion to determine whether evidence is relevant, and whether relevant evidence should be excluded.\u201d <em>State v. Peterson, </em>10th Dist. No. 07AP-303, 2008-Ohio-2838, 2008 WL 2390781, \u00b6 36, citing <em>State v. Johnson, </em>9th Dist. No. 22688, 2006-Ohio-1313, 2006 WL 709044, \u00b6 23. \u201cGang affiliation can be relevant in cases in which the interrelationship between people is a central issue.\u201d <em>Drummond </em>at \u00b6 112, citing <em>United States v. Thomas </em>(C.A.7, 1996), 86 F.3d 647, 652. Gang evidence also may be relevant when it is necessary to \u201cprovide[ ] the jury with crucial background information in considering the evidence.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">{\u00b6 36} In allowing Sandford to testify regarding MS-13, the court stated that MS-13 was \u201cpart of the story\u201d in this case. The testimony supports the court\u2019s rationale that El Gato Negro was an establishment that MS-13 members frequented. On the night of the incident, the Ramos party went to El Gato Negro to pick up Wilson\u2019s brother, who was having problems with MS-13 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>members. Wilson testified that he felt the situation was an emergency that needed immediate attention because his brother was alone. According to Wilson, Momia, who started the altercation, consistently tried to fight with Wilson and his cousins. Momia and his group would \u201csay that they were the gang and they were the one who has the powers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">{\u00b6 37} Further evidence surrounding the incident implicated MS-13. The confidential informant, who turned the murder weapon over to Sandford, worked for the police gathering information about MS-13. She lived with several known MS-13 members over the years, and a documented MS-13 member gave the informant the gun and told her to get rid of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">{\u00b6 38} Pyfrom\u2019s testimony relevant to his identifying defendant also referred to MS-13. According to Pyfrom, he gave police the false name \u201cJames Johnson\u201d both on the night of the incident and when he picked defendant out of the photo array because he knew that MS-13 was dangerous and did not want anyone to find him. Pyfrom agreed that \u201cif a member of MS-13 figured out that, you know, [he was] fingering one of their guys, they could retaliate against\u201d him. Sandford testified that after being given defendant\u2019s street name, he was able to come up with defendant\u2019s actual name by showing photographs of MS-13 contacts and associates to people they interviewed.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">{\u00b6 39} The evidence pertaining to MS-13 thus was relevant to explain the relationships among the parties and to provide necessary background information regarding why the Ramos group went to El Gato Negro, how the police had obtained the murder weapon, why Pyfrom initially used a false name, and how the police came to identify defendant as a suspect.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">{\u00b6 40} Relying on Evid.R. 403(A), defendant nonetheless asserts that the trial court should have anticipated the \u201cprovocative nature of the evidence\u201d and excluded the testimony because the unfair prejudice of the gang-related testimony substantially outweighed any relevancy or probative value the testimony may have had. To exclude evidence pursuant to Evid.R. 403(A), the \u201cprobative value must be minimal and the prejudice great.\u201d <em>State v. Morales </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 252, 258, 513 N.E.2d 267.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-9\">{\u00b6 41} Defendant does not challenge Sandford\u2019s gang-related testimony as it pertained to how he obtained the murder weapon or his interrogation of defendant, stating that Sandford\u2019s \u201ctestimony as to those events [was] clearly proper.\u201d Defendant instead claims that Sandford\u2019s MS-13 testimony went well beyond what was necessary, specifically pointing to a portion of the detective\u2019s testimony where he stated that \u201cMS-13 members across the world have been involved in countless homicides and felonious assaults, shooting people. They\u2019re known for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>their tendency toward violence, using machetes to chop people\u2019s hands and fingers and heads off.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">{\u00b6 42} The statement, however, arose out of defendant\u2019s cross-examining Sandford. Exploring defendant\u2019s theory that an MS-13 member committed the murder but witnesses identified defendant, who allegedly was not an MS-13 member, out of fear of retaliation, defendant asked Sandford if it would be \u201cfair to say that at least in your opinion, Detective, MS-13 is a relatively dangerous gang?\u201d The detective responded \u201cOverall, yes,\u201d causing the court to inquire what the detective meant by \u201coverall.\u201d Sandford responded with the statement defendant contests. Where defendant created the circumstances causing the statement to which defendant objects, plain error is not evident. See <em>State v. Bogovich, </em>10th Dist. No. 07AP-774, 2008-Ohio-3100, 2008 WL 2514085, \u00b6 10 (explaining that invited error precludes a claim of reversible plain error).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">{\u00b6 43} In the final analysis, the MS-13-related testimony was relevant in providing the jury with background information concerning the individuals involved in the case and police methods for solving the murder. As defendant acknowledges, that testimony was properly admitted. Because defendant elicited what arguably was the most prejudicial and inflammatory statement regarding MS-13, the trial court did not commit plain error in allowing the testimony into evidence. Moreover, considering the three separate eyewitnesses who identified defendant as the shooter, we cannot say that the jury\u2019s verdict would have been otherwise absent the MS-13-related testimony to which defendant objects.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">{\u00b6 44} Defendant\u2019s second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">V. Third Assignment of Error \u2014 Pretrial Identifications</p>\n<p id=\"b282-8\">{\u00b6 45} Defendant\u2019s third assignment of error challenges the trial court\u2019s decision to admit Wilmer\u2019s and Pyfrom\u2019s pretrial identification of defendant from a photo array. Prior to trial, defendant filed a motion seeking to suppress identification testimony, to reveal the identification procedures used, and to identify the confidential informant. The motion sought to suppress \u201call identifications,\u201d claiming they not only were conducted out of the presence of counsel but were \u201cso suggestive and conducive\u201d as to increase the likelihood of \u201cirreparable mistaken identification as to violate due process.\u201d Although the motion appeared to seek to suppress all identifications, at the suppression hearing the prosecution stated that it was its \u201cunderstanding [that] the only photo array we\u2019re dealing with is the one that was shown to Edward Pyfrom.\u201d Defendant did not dispute the prosecution\u2019s understanding, so the entire suppression hearing centered solely on Pyfrom\u2019s identification. Because defendant received pertinent information regarding the confidential informant, it was not an issue in the trial court and is not on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>{\u00b6 46} \u201c[A]ppellate review of a trial court\u2019s decision regarding a motion to suppress evidence involves mixed questions of law and fact.\u201d <em>State v. Vest </em>(May 29, 2001), 4th Dist. No. 00CA2576, 2001 WL 605217. Thus, an appellate court\u2019s standard of review of the trial court\u2019s decision granting the motion to suppress is twofold. <em>State v. Reedy, </em>10th Dist. No. 05AP-501, 2006-Ohio-1212, 2006 WL 648861, \u00b6 5, citing <em>State v. Lloyd </em>(1998), 126 Ohio App.3d 95, 100-101, 709 N.E.2d 913. Because the trial court is in the best position to weigh the credibility of the witnesses, we must uphold the trial court\u2019s findings of fact if competent, credible evidence supports them. Id., citing <em>State v. Klein </em>(1991), 73 Ohio App.3d 486, 488, 597 N.E.2d 1141. We nonetheless must independently determine, as a matter of law, whether the facts meet the applicable legal standard. Id., citing <em>State v. Claytor </em>(1993), 85 Ohio App.3d 623, 627, 620 N.E.2d 906.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">{\u00b6 47} A defendant\u2019s right to due process prohibits the use of identification procedures that are so impermissibly suggestive as to give rise to a substantial likelihood of misidentification. <em>Neil v. Riggers </em>(1972), 409 U.S. 188, 198, 93 S.Ct. 375, 34 L.Ed.2d 401. \u201c[Reliability is the linchpin in determining the admissibility of identification testimony.\u201d <em>Manson v. Rrathwaite </em>(1977), 432 U.S. 98, 114, 97 S.Ct. 2243, 53 L.Ed.2d 140. A trial court considering whether to admit identification evidence must utilize a two-step analysis. Initially, the court must consider whether the procedure was impermissibly suggestive. Secondly, the court must consider whether, despite the procedure\u2019s suggestiveness, the identification was reliable. <em>State v. Sharp, </em>10th Dist. No. 09AP-408, 2009-Ohio-6847, 2009 WL 5062338, \u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">{\u00b6 48} When assessing the reliability of a pretrial identification, the court must consider the totality of the circumstances, including the following factors: the opportunity of the witness to view the criminal at the time of the crime, the witness\u2019s degree of attention, the accuracy of his or her prior description of the criminal, the level of certainty demonstrated at the identification, and the time between the crime and the identification. <em>Riggers, </em>409 U.S. at 199, 93 S.Ct. 375, 34 L.Ed.2d 401. Defendant carries the burden of proving \u201cboth [that] an identification procedure was impermissibly suggestive and the identification was unreliable.\u201d <em>Sharp </em>at \u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-9\">{\u00b6 49} Within those parameters, defendant particularly takes issue with the method the detective utilized in presenting defendant\u2019s photograph to Wilmer and Pyfrom. Detective Wachalec, the lead detective investigating the murder, presented both witnesses with a \u201csimultaneous array\u201d consisting of six photographs, side by side, also known as a \u201csix-pack.\u201d Defendant contends that such a procedure is unduly suggestive and,that the witnesses should have been shown the photographs one at a time. Defendant further contends that the detective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>should have presented the pictures through a \u201cdouble-blind method,\u201d where a neutral officer, who lacks knowledge of the targeted suspect, shows the photo array to the witness. Contrary to defendant\u2019s contentions, the \u201cfailure to present the photo array using the double-blind and sequential methods does not make the identification procedure unduly suggestive.\u201d <em>Monford, </em>190 Ohio App.3d 35, 2010-Ohio-4732, 940 N.E.2d 634, at \u00b6 51, 54, citing <em>United States v. Lawrence </em>(C.A.3, 2003), 349 F.3d 109, 115 (noting that \u201cshowing all of the photographs at once using the \u2018six pack\u2019 method could also be a very fair way to proceed\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">{\u00b6 50} In response to <em>Monford, </em>defendant cites newly enacted R.C. 2933.83 and urges us to conclude that the six-pack or simultaneous-array method is unduly suggestive. Although R.C. 2933.83, enacted by S.B. 77, instructs law-enforcement agencies to use the double-blind method and shows a clear preference for the sequential method, it became effective July 6, 2010, well after the pretrial identifications and trial here. Accordingly, R.C. 2933.83 does not control the identification procedures that law enforcement utilized in defendant\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">A. Pyfrom\u2019s identification \u2014 photo array</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">{\u00b6 51} At the suppression hearing, Wachalec testified that he had used a computer program to generate the lineup, entering criteria \u201csuch as facial hair, length of hair, type of hair and other descriptors.\u201d The program generated a series of photographs based on the entered criteria. Wachalec then went through the computer-generated photos and picked out ones that \u201cbest match[ed] the subject of the photo array.\u201d The five selected photos all depict Latino males with short hair and similar facial features who appear to be around the same age. All the photos in the array were in black and white. Wachalec testified that the procedure he used to develop the photo array was a long-standing procedure in the police department.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">{\u00b6 52} When Wachalec showed Pyfrom the array, he informed him that the pictures were in no particular order of importance, the suspect may or may not be included among the photographs, and Pyfrom was not required to select any photograph. The detective further testified that he never told Pyfrom he was to pick defendant. On the night of the incident, Pyfrom told officers that he could identify the shooter, and the detective said that Pyfrom had no problem in choosing defendant out of the photo array.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-9\">{\u00b6 53} Given that evidence, the trial court properly refused to suppress Pyfrom\u2019s pretrial identification of defendant, as nothing about the identification procedure was impermissibly suggestive. Accordingly, we need not address whether the identification was unreliable under the totality of the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>B. Wilmer\u2019s identification \u2014 photo array</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">{\u00b6 54} The suppression hearing addressed only Pyfrom\u2019s pretrial identification of defendant, so we do not address Wilmer\u2019s identification in the context of defendant\u2019s motion to suppress. Instead, we review defendant\u2019s contention that the testimony was improperly admitted into evidence. Defendant did not object to Wilmer\u2019s in-court testimony regarding his pretrial identification of defendant, so defendant forfeited all but plain error. <em>State v. Smith </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.Sd 89, 115, 684 N.E.2d 668.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">{\u00b6 55} Defendant argues that the pretrial identification procedure regarding the photo array shown to Wilmer was unduly suggestive because Wilmer testified, \u201cWell, to tell you the truth, [the detective] asked me is this the person who shot at you.\u201d The transcript, however, is unclear whether Wachalec made the statement to Wilmer before or after Wilmer identified defendant from the array. Aside from the simultaneous-array method and the above statement, defendant does not challenge any other aspect of Wilmer\u2019s pretrial identification. Whether or not either element reveals error, any error does not rise to the level of plain error in view of the two other witnesses who testified that defendant was the shooter. Accordingly, we overrule defendant\u2019s third assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">VI. Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">{\u00b6 56} Having overruled defendant\u2019s three assignments of error, we affirm the judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b285-9\">Bryant, P.J., and Sadler and Dorrian, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
