The victims are Richcreek\u2019s twin half-sisters (identified herein as \u201cA.M.\u201d and \u201cA.L.\u201d). The alleged rapes occurred at a home that the sisters share with their stepfather, mother, and Richcreek in Perrysburg Township.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-10\">{\u00b6 2} In March 2009, the Wood County Grand Jury first indicted Richcreek on two single counts of rape against A.M. and A.L., denominated as case Nos. 2009CR0124 and 2009CR0125, respectively. Then, in August 2009, a second indictment was returned against him containing three additional counts as to A.L., denominated as case No. 2009CR0375. All counts of rape are first-degree felonies in violation of R.C. 2907.02(A)(2). The jury found Richcreek guilty on all five counts following a two-day trial. Sentencing and sex-offender-classification hearings were held. The trial court determined Richcreek to be a Tier III offender and ordered him to register as such. The court then sentenced him to five consecutive eight-year terms of imprisonment. This appeal ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-11\">{\u00b6 3} For the reasons that follow, we reverse. Because this appeal involves different witnesses and different dates for the alleged rapes, we will discuss the facts separately with respect to each sister.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b547-12\">{\u00b6 4} The record, witness testimony, and documents admitted at trial reflect the following facts relevant to the sole count of rape involving A.M. This incident allegedly occurred in February 2007, when she was 17 years old. At trial the state first called Nicholas Bissett, a friend of A.M., who testified that they had attended school together at Penta Career Center. According to Bissett, one night while on his computer, he received an instant message from A.M. that said, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>\u201cMy older brother raped me.\u201d Defense counsel objected to this testimony on hearsay grounds. After the prosecutor responded that \u201cit\u2019s not being offered for the truth of the matter asserted necessarily but to show what [A.M.] did,\u201d the court overruled the objection. Bissett then testified that AM.\u2019s message said that she had been in the basement where Richcreek\u2019s bedroom was and that he \u201ccornered me, pushed me on his bed, and * * * had his way with me.\u201d He urged her to report the incident, but A.M. replied, \u201cDon\u2019t tell anyone,\u201d and \u201cI\u2019ll handle it in my own way.\u201d Sometime later, Bissett received a second computer message from A.M. that said, \u201cJoe did it to me again.\u201d Further objections were overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">{\u00b6 5} The next day at school Bissett took her to a Penta County school official to report the incident. This led to a February 26, 2007 interview with Matthew Weaver, a Perrysburg Township police officer, during which Weaver obtained written statements from both Bissett and A.M. At trial, Weaver testified about A.M.\u2019s handwritten 2007 report. Over a hearsay objection, he was allowed to summarize the contents of this report, telling the jury that \u201cfor the past five years she had been molested by her half brother Joseph [and she] stated it had taken place numerous times since she had been twelve years old.\u201d The report described these encounters in which A.M. wrote that Richcreek would \u201cmolest me by grabbing my chest or touching my vigina [sic]. He would then have sex with me.\u201d Weaver indicated that A.M. denied that Richcreek forced or threatened her, but that \u201cshe did indicate each time that she told him no.\u201d Further hearsay objections were overruled on the same nonhearsay basis, and A.M.\u2019s report was admitted at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">{\u00b6 6} After meeting with Weaver, A.M. was taken to St. Luke\u2019s Hospital, where she met with sexual-assault nurse Sharon Wilson and Wood County Children Services investigator Jennifer Bender. Despite defense counsel\u2019s \u201congoing hearsay objection,\u201d Bender summarized the substance of her report at trial, stating that A.M. said that \u201cshe had been raped by Joseph Richcreek.\u201d According to Bender, A.M. and her mother, Barb English, who was also present, were uncooperative. A.M. refused a sexual-assault examination because \u201cshe did not want her brother to go to jail [but] just wanted him to move out of the house.\u201d Bender testified that her agency declined to pursue criminal prosecution of the rape allegation in 2007 \u201cdue to [the] family\u2019s non-cooperation.\u201d Nurse Wilson testified that A.M. refused a rape-kit exam, although a pelvic exam and a pregnancy test were conducted. The hospital\u2019s emergency-department physician\u2019s report lists \u201cpossible sexual assault\u201d and \u201cquestionable sexual assault\u201d as the reasons for the examination. The emergency-department report was admitted at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">{\u00b6 7} The next day at school, A.M. met with Perrysburg Township Officer Rachel Bernhard, who was also the Penta County school-resource officer. Bern-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>hard testified that A.M. said Richcreek approached her while she was at her computer \u201cand told her to meet him in the basement [where] his bedroom was.\u201d Though counsel asserted a second \u201congoing\u201d hearsay objection to Bernhard\u2019s testimony, the court overruled it, telling the jury: \u201cAgain, it\u2019s not being offered for the truth of the matter asserted and the witness is under subpoena and subject to cross-examination.\u201d Bernhard then testified that A.M. said that Richcreek \u201cmade her grab his penis [and then] made her take her pants off and he threw her on the bed and had sexual intercourse with her.\u201d Bernhard stated that A.M. denied that Richcreek had made threats or held her down, \u201cbut she told him no, but he did it anyway.\u201d A.M. said that she did not tell anyone about the incident, Bernhard testified, because \u201cshe didn\u2019t want her brother to be in trouble or go to jail.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">{\u00b68} Two years later, in February 2009, Perrysburg Township Detective James Gross met with A.M. to discuss her 2007 report. Gross did so because he was then investigating similar claims made more recently by her sister, A.L., that Richcreek had sexually assaulted her several times. At trial Gross testified that A.M. told him that the earlier 2007 allegations were true, but that she had not cooperated then because \u201cshe did not want to get her brother in trouble.\u201d After this meeting, A.M. wrote three emotionally ambivalent letters to Gross. Much of the subject matter was vague, but none of the letters made specific claims of forcible sexual assault by Richcreek. The letters were admitted at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">{\u00b6 9} From both Detective Gross\u2019s investigation and a voice-mail message that the prosecutor received from A.M. several weeks before trial, the state was already aware that she would be recalcitrant. She was subpoenaed to testify for the prosecution on August 17, 2009, but failed to appear at trial. The prosecutor then moved for and was granted a material-witness arrest warrant, and A.M. was arrested the same day. Prosecution witnesses Bissett, Weaver, Bernhard, Bender, and Wilson all testified prior to A.M.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">{\u00b6 10} When A.M. testified on August 18, she recanted the substance of her earlier statements to these witnesses, specifically denying that Richcreek raped her. A.M. conceded making the 2007 rape claim, but stated that she did so only because she was jealous of the way her parents favored Richcreek \u201cwith more attention,\u201d while being strict with her, and because she \u201cwanted him kicked out of the house.\u201d She persisted with the rape claim during Gross\u2019s 2009 investigation only because she feared \u201c[getting] in trouble for writing a false [police] report.\u201d Through extensive questioning about her previous statements to the various witnesses and those in her police report and letters to Gross, the prosecutor attempted to impeach A.M.\u2019s recantation. However, she continued to deny having been raped by Richcreek. Defense counsel then cross-examined her about her prior statements. She again denied that Richcreek ever threatened <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>her or forced her to have intercourse, explaining that she fabricated the claim out of jealousy because he received more favorable parental attention and gifts, such as a car.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">{\u00b6 11} Unlike A.M., A.L. did not recant her claims of rape. The four incidents on which these counts are based are as follows. A.L. testified that on January 30, 2009, while at home, she and Richcreek were \u201cwrestling around\u201d in the living room. He then \u201ctook [her] downstairs and had sex with [her]\u201d in his basement bedroom. A.L. explained that after telling him to stop, he continued removing her clothes. When she tried to fight him, \u201che hit and punched [her].\u201d A.L. testified that on February 2, 2009, after again wrestling with Richcreek, \u201che drug [her] downstairs to his room, and he had sex with [her] again.\u201d She was 19 at the time of the 2009 incidents.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">{\u00b6 12} A.L. also testified that Richcreek raped her twice in December 2008. The first incident occurred on December 19 after Richcreek and A.L. had been wrestling in the living room. Later, after taking a shower, she found a note Richcreek left in her bedroom asking her to come to the basement. She complied and, once there, he asked to borrow some money. A.L. stated that Richcreek then \u201cgrabbed ahold of me and threw me on his bed and had sex with me.\u201d She attempted to push him away, but testified that \u201che\u2019s stronger than me and overpowered me.\u201d She did not tell her mother because she feared she would not believe her.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">{\u00b6 13} A.L. testified that the next morning, Richcreek apologized \u201cfor what he did the day before.\u201d Later, however, while she was doing laundry in the basement, he assaulted her again. A.L. testified that during this incident Richcreek \u201cgrabbed me by the back of my pants and drug me to his room and had sex with me.\u201d Seven days later, she told her father that Richcreek \u201ckept having sex\u201d -with her. He asked A.L. if she wanted him to tell her mother. She replied that he should because her mother would not believe her. During her direct testimony, A.L. identified a stun gun that Detective Gross seized during his execution of a search warrant at the residence. A.L. testified that Richcreek kept the stun gun next to his bed and \u201cthreatened that he\u2019d use it on me if I told anybody.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">{\u00b6 14} The rapes involving A.L. came to Detective Gross\u2019s attention in 2009 while she was serving as a private in the Ohio National Guard. A.L.\u2019s lieutenant, Megan Butler, received a report on February 6 or 7, 2009, from her sergeant, Dwayne King, stating that A.L. had been sexually assaulted. Butler then met with her about the report. At trial, Butler testified that A.L. said her \u201cstepbrother\u201d had \u201cforced [her] to have sex against her will.\u201d King testified that she said \u201cher brother had been raping her for a long time.\u201d Defense counsel objected to their testimony, but the court permitted it, ruling: \u201cIt would not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>hearsay <em>if it\u2019s not being offered for the truth of what this witness is saying, but what they did in response to what they heard </em>and that witness that made the statement to this witness was also present and subject to cross[-examination] (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">{\u00b6 15} After speaking to A.L., Butler contacted Gross, who interviewed A.L. and made a report. Butler then took A.L. to St. Luke\u2019s Hospital, where she was examined on February 7 and again on February 15. The composite report of both exams was admitted at trial. No rape-kit exam was performed because the lapse in time had compromised the collection of forensic evidence. The report noted visible bruises on her arms and thighs and recorded her complaints of \u201csuprapubic pain.\u201d It further indicated that A.L. sought testing to determine whether she was pregnant. The hospital report was admitted in evidence at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">{\u00b6 16} Following his interview with A.L., Gross applied for a search warrant for Richcreek\u2019s residence and executed it the same day. During the search, Gross encountered Richcreek in the basement. The warrant sought various items of evidence in connection with the sexual assaults on A.L. on January 30 and February 2. The search warrant, including the affidavit, the return, and the inventory pages, were admitted in their entirety at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">{\u00b6 17} Also admitted was a laboratory report from the Bureau of Criminal Identification and Investigation, which indicated that forensic testing on clothing seized in the search was unsuccessful.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">{\u00b6 18} In this appeal, Richcreek has assigned eight errors for review, the third of which states:</p>\n<p id=\"b551-9\">{\u00b6 19} \u201cHI. The trial court erred in admitting multiple instances of hearsay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b551-10\">{\u00b6 20} In this assignment, Richcreek argues for reversal of his convictions based on the court\u2019s repeated allowance of inadmissible hearsay and on the prosecutor\u2019s improper use of it during closing argument. Because the challenged testimony raises a number of discrete hearsay issues with respect to each victim, we will address these issues separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-11\">{\u00b6 21} Before doing so, however, the apparent antinomy between the parties in applying the hearsay rule to the testimony in this case warrants a brief review of the rule\u2019s operative components.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-12\">{\u00b6 22} The prefatory rule for determining whether an extrajudicial statement is hearsay is definitional. Evid.R. 801(C) defines \u201chearsay\u201d as \u201ca statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d Hearsay is inadmissible under Evid.R. 802, unless a particular statement fails to meet the two-part definition in Evid.R. 801(C), or fully satisfies the conditions for nonhearsay prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>statements under Evid.R. 801(D)(1) or (2), or falls within one of recognized exceptions under Evid.R. 803 or 804.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">{\u00b6 23} Where the facts to be proven at trial and the substantive content of an out-of-court statement coincide, it can be presumed that the proponent is offering the statement for its truth. Facially, therefore, the statement meets the two-part hearsay definition. If, however, the statement is explicitly offered without reference to its truth, then under Evid.R. 801(C) it is not hearsay. <em>State v. Clay, </em>187 Ohio App.3d 633, 2010-Ohio-2720, 933 N.E.2d 296, \u00b6 27; <em>State v. Price </em>(1992), 80 Ohio App.3d 108, 110, 608 N.E.2d 1088. The statement\u2019s admissibility is then evaluated by the standard of relevancy balanced against unfair prejudice, which is the province of Evid.R. 403(A). See <em>State v. Maurer </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 239, 263, 473 N.E.2d 768. If germane for some valid purpose (e.g., to show notice), the statement typically would be admissible for that purpose. See, e.g., <em>State v. Rice, </em>11th Dist. No. 09-A-0034, 2010-Ohio-1638, 2010 WL 1444519, \u00b6 22; <em>State v. Hawthorne, </em>6th Dist. No. L-03-1120, 2005-Ohio-1553, 2005 WL 736994, \u00b6 35-37.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">{\u00b6 24} However, admissibility is not automatic in the case of a \u201cdual use\u201d statement. This is an out-of-court statement having an ostensibly nonsubstantive use, but whose content carries substantive import because it relates to an element of the crime or implicates the defendant directly. Despite a professed nonhearsay use, if the statement\u2019s content could also cut toward proof of guilt, the potential for abuse is great. See <em>State v. Blanton, </em>184 Ohio App.3d 611, 2009-Ohio-5334, 921 N.E.2d 1103, \u00b6 38-39, and <em>State v. Blevins </em>(1987), 36 Ohio App.3d 147, 149-150, 521 N.E.2d 1105. When dual-use statements are offered \u201cto explain conduct,\u201d for example, we note that the Tenth Appellate District has imposed special requirements. In <em>Blanton, </em>the court held:</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">{\u00b6 25} \u201c[T]he conduct to be explained must be relevant, equivocal, and contemporaneous with the statements. * * * Further, the statements must meet the standard of Evid.R. 403(A). * * * Finally, <em>\u2018when the [out-of-court] statements connect the accused with the crime charged, they should generally be </em>excluded.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added.) Id. at \u00b6 39, quoting <em>State v. Humphrey, </em>10th Dist. No. 07AP-837, 2008-Ohio-6302, 2008 WL 5104775, \u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">{\u00b6 26} In short, the well-worn phrase \u201cnot offered for the truth of the matter asserted\u201d is not a talismanic incantation that opens the door to everything said outside the courtroom. For an extrajudicial statement of this type, a secondary assessment under Evid.R. 403(A) is required. The trial court must consider whether the risk that the jury will prejudicially misuse the content for its truth exceeds the probative value of the statement for the nonhearsay purpose. <em>Blanton </em>at \u00b6 39; <em>Humphrey </em>at \u00b6 11; Evid.R. 403(A). If the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>admits the statement after this weighing, an appropriate limiting instruction must be given to the jury. <em>Blevins, </em>36 Ohio App.3d at 150, 521 N.E.2d 1105; Evid.R 105.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">{\u00b6 27} Of more importance to the testimony challenged here is the derivative principle that when an out-of-court statement is received for a purpose other than the truth of its content, <em>then the content is not substantive evidence. </em>See <em>State v. Kirk, </em>6th Dist. No. H-09-006, 2010-Ohio-2006, 2010 WL 1818894, \u00b6 28; <em>State v. Kline </em>(1983), 11 Ohio App.3d 208, 211, 464 N.E.2d 159; <em>Dayton v. Combs </em>(1993), 94 Ohio App.3d 291, 296, 640 N.E.2d 863. Once a statement is so received, its content may not be used or relied upon later as substantive proof (i.e., the truth of what it asserts). <em>Kirk </em>at \u00b6 28; <em>State v. Sinkfield </em>(Oct. 2, 1998), 2d Dist. No. 16277, 1998 WL 677413.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">(1) A.M.\u2019s extrajudicial statements</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">{\u00b6 28} Richcreek argues that he was prejudiced by the trial court\u2019s admission of A.M.\u2019s out-of-court statements for a purpose which in theory rendered them nonhearsay, but which the prosecution in fact used as substantive evidence to establish the elements of rape under R.C. 2907.02(A)(2), and specifically the essential element of force. In response, the state appears to recognize that admitting A.M.\u2019s statements for a nonhearsay purpose would defeat their use as substantive evidence to prove the rape charge. Indeed, the state now admits that her out-of-court statements were hearsay. Counsel for the state also concedes that the prosecutor, in the state\u2019s case-in-chief and in closing argument, did rely on these statements for their substantive truth. The state maintains, however, that regardless of the nonhearsay theory under which they were allowed at trial, most of her statements were admissible as excited utterances under Evid.R. 803(3). The state also suggests that other statements may comport with the exception for \u201cthen existing state of mind, emotion [or] physical condition\u201d under Evid.R. 803(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">{\u00b6 29} We find the state\u2019s new arguments unacceptable for several reasons. Counsel for the state initially asserts that whether to admit or exclude hearsay is within the trial court\u2019s discretion. That assertion is incorrect. While there is discretion to admit or exclude relevant evidence, there is no \u201cdiscretion\u201d to admit hearsay. <em>State v. Sutorius </em>(1997), 122 Ohio App.3d 1, 7, 701 N.E.2d 1; <em>State v. Sorrels </em>(1991), 71 Ohio App.3d 162, 593 N.E.2d 313.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>{\u00b6 30} In <em>Sorrels, </em>the First Appellate District delineated the applicable standard of review for challenged hearsay testimony:</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">{\u00b6 31} \u201c[T]he trial court\u2019s decision to admit hearsay is not governed by the test of abuse of discretion, which the Supreme Court applies to instances where the trial court\u2019s evidentiary rulings relate to matters expressly or implicitly within its discretion, as in rulings on relevancy (Evid.R. 402 and 403) or expert testimony (Evid.R.702). * * * Instead, errors relating to the trial court\u2019s admission of hearsay must be reviewed in light of Evid.R. 103(A) and the standard established in Crim.R. 52(A), providing that such errors are harmless unless the record demonstrates that the errors affected a party\u2019s substantial right.\u201d Id. at 165, 593 N.E.2d 313.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">{\u00b6 32} On appeal, challenged hearsay is subject to de novo review under the applicable hearsay rule, rather than the more deferential review employed for discretionary rulings. Id. The <em>Sorrels </em>court also noted that \u201c[i]f the trier of fact, whether it be a jury or a trial judge, expressly relies upon hearsay statements in determining guilt, the admission of the hearsay is prejudicial.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-8\">{\u00b6 33} Second, it is a cardinal rule of appellate procedure that a party cannot assert new legal theories for the first time on appeal. <em>In re Banks, </em>4th Dist. No. 07CA3192, 2008-Ohio-2339, 2008 WL 2043231, \u00b6 7-10. This rule applies to new arguments for the admission of evidence not made during trial. See <em>State v. York </em>(1996), 115 Ohio App.3d 245, 249, 685 N.E.2d 261 (failure to raise and argue the excited-utterance exception at trial waives the issue on appeal). \u201cLitigants must not be permitted to hold their arguments in reserve for appeal, thus evading the trial court process.\u201d <em>Mark v. Mellott Mfg. Co., Inc. </em>(1995), 106 Ohio App.3d 571, 589, 666 N.E.2d 631.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-9\">{\u00b6 34} Third, even assuming that the state\u2019s belated argument in defense of the hearsay testimony was properly before us, the exceptions under Evid.R. 803(2) and (3) require the proponent to demonstrate that specific conditions existed before an out-of-court statement qualifies as either an excited-utterance or a declaration of a then-existing mental or emotional state. Here, the trial court never considered whether any of A.M.\u2019s extrajudicial statements met the admissibility criteria for either exception. The prosecutor never argued that they did, nor did she attempt to lay the relevant foundation for either exception. Indeed, it was not her intent to do so. To each objection, the prosecutor merely asserted that repeating A.M.\u2019s statements was necessary for some <em>nonsubstantive </em>purpose that rendered them nonhearsay under Evid.R. 801(C); however, if now allowed under any of the Evid.R. 803 exceptions, those same statements would constitute exactly the opposite \u2014 i.e., substantive proof of the elements of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>{\u00b6 35} Evid.R. 803(2) provides that \u201c[a] statement relating to a startling event or condition made while the declarant was under the stress of excitement caused by the event or condition\u201d is an exception to the hearsay rule. The four-part foundation for qualifying a particular out-of-court statement as an excited utterance has long been an established evidentiary doctrine in Ohio. See <em>State v. Taylor </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 295, 300-301, 612 N.E.2d 316; <em>State v. Humphries </em>(1992), 79 Ohio App.3d 589, 598, 607 N.E.2d 921. However, because the state did not attempt to show that any of A.M.\u2019s out-of-court statements met the criteria of this exception, and because the trial court made no such determination, we are unable to conclude on this record that they did. The same is true of certain statements that the state now suggests might be construed as declarations of then existing mental or emotional conditions under Evid.R. 803(3). The various hearsay exceptions require particularized foundational questioning in order to establish the conditions unique to each and from which the trial court can assess whether a statement is admissible under the claimed exception. If challenged as error on appeal, this court can then review whether its admission under that exception was proper in light of the record. That was not done here. See, e.g., <em>State v. Baker, </em>9th Dist. No. 21414, 2003-Ohio-4637, 2003 WL 22047697, If 7-10 (Evid.R. 803(6)); <em>State v. Shelton, </em>11th Dist. No. 2001-P-0050, 2002-Ohio-5157, 2002 WL 31160564, \u00b6 6-8 (Evid.R. 803(2)).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">{\u00b6 36} The fourth problem with the state\u2019s position is the most serious. The hearsay objections during trial were met with the response that A.M.\u2019s statements were <em>not </em>being repeated for their substantive truth-value (i.e., that Richcreek forced her to have intercourse). That representation could only mean that the prosecutor did not intend for these out-of-court statements to prove any element of the crime; rather, they were needed for some limited <em>nonsubstantive </em>purpose, such as to establish identity, to show state of mind, to clarify ambiguous conduct, or, as was consistently asserted here, to explain why the witness took certain actions in response to her statement. See, e.g., <em>State v. Williams </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 346, 348, 528 N.E.2d 910, fn. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">{\u00b6 37} However, during closing argument, the prosecutor took a different approach with this same testimony. A review of the trial transcript reveals several instances in which the prosecutor asserted that A.M.\u2019s statements to the witnesses, in effect, proved that forcible sexual conduct occurred. In her rebuttal, for example, the prosecutor stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">{\u00b6 38} \u201c[A.M.] <em>told everybody back in 2007 </em>[that she was] forced and pushed. There was never any indication that he scratched them or used any type of weapon on them or anything like that. <em>You don\u2019t need that for force.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>{\u00b6 39} Plainly, on the essential element of force, the prosecutor was asking the jury to accept the truth of what six witnesses told them A.M. said, and then to conclude that her hearsay statements sufficed to prove that element. This constituted an improper use of those statements for their substantive truth-value. We have previously warned against this same switch-of-purpose tactic for otherwise inadmissible hearsay and held it to be prosecutorial misconduct. See <em>State v. Kirk, </em>2010-Ohio-2006, 2010 WL 1818894, at \u00b6 33 (\u201cThe prosecutor essentially gave the jurors permission to use the hearsay statements as substantive evidence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">{\u00b6 40} In <em>Kirk, </em>this court found reversible error when the prosecutor, in closing argument, \u201creferred to testimony which she [had] expressly claim[ed] to have offered not for its truth, but to explain subsequent actions taken by the detectives.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 29. There, an investigating detective was permitted to testify to several out-of-court statements from a confidential informant. The prosecutor had elicited these statements purportedly to explain how the detective\u2019s investigation developed. Yet, when their actual use was viewed collectively, the statements \u201cwere offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted in them [and demonstrate] appellant\u2019s guilt by connecting him to a known drug dealer.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 19-22. Their substantive use during the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument went \u201cfar beyond\u201d the limited explanatory purpose for which the statements were initially allowed. Id. This court held:</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">{\u00b6 41} \u201cThe prosecutor has now relied on extrajudicial statements for their truth \u2014 statements which she maintained during trial were not offered for their truth \u2014 as evidence that appellant brought the crack cocaine from Akron into Willard. The prosecutor\u2019s remarks were improper and argued beyond the record.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 29.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">{\u00b6 42} The same conduct \u2014 and the same error \u2014 occurred here in the use of A.M.\u2019s statements during the state\u2019s case-in-chief and in closing argument. See also <em>State v. Wilson </em>(Apr. 19, 2002), 1st Dist. No. C-000670, 2002 WL 598226 (prosecutor\u2019s reference to inadmissible hearsay in closing argument was misconduct). Also, as in <em>Kirk, </em>the trial court failed to give any limiting instruction restricting the jury\u2019s use of her statements to the stated purpose. Id. at \u00b6 33. See Evid.R. 105. This failure was only exacerbated when the court later instructed the jury, without qualification, that \u201c[e]vidence is <em>all the testimony </em>received from the witness stand * * (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>{\u00b6 43} Citing our decision in <em>State v. Duszynski, </em>6th Dist. No. L-10-1063, 2010-Ohio-6511, 2010 WL 5550686, the state argues that the extrajudicial statements elicited from Weaver, Bender, Bernhard, and Gross and the reports in which Weaver and Bender recorded those statements were merely \u201ccumulative,\u201d and thus any error in allowing their testimony and the reports was harmless. Generally, where other admissible substantive evidence tending to prove the offense mirrors the improper hearsay, the error in allowing the hearsay is deemed harmless, since it would not have changed the outcome of the trial. See <em>State v. Byrd, </em>8th Dist. No. 82145, 2003-Ohio-3958, 2003 WL 21710795, \u00b6 39.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">{\u00b6 44} <em>Duszynski, </em>however, is distinguishable because there the victim did not recant at trial. He \u201ctestified extensively\u201d about the defendant\u2019s acts of sexual imposition. Id. at \u00b6 52. His account supplied sufficient proof from which the jury could infer each element of the crime. Although in <em>Duszynski </em>we found error in allowing a police detective to recount the victim\u2019s statements during an interview about the sexual abuse, the error was harmless in light of the remaining, properly admitted testimony. Id. at \u00b6 48-53. Here, in contrast, A.M. recanted her previous statements and denied being raped. There were no eyewitnesses and no conclusive physical or forensic evidence. The notation of a \u201cquestionable sexual assault\u201d in the St. Luke\u2019s emergency report was ambiguous at best, and when A.M. recanted, the prosecutor used that report solely for impeachment.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">{\u00b6 45} Improper hearsay affects a substantial right only where it appears the trier of fact relied on it for conviction. <em>State v. Sorrels, </em>71 Ohio App.3d at 165, 593 N.E.2d 313. The hearsay that was improperly used here to prove the \u201cforce or threat of force\u201d element of R.C. 2907.02(A) was not cumulative, because, absent the hearsay, there was no other admissible substantive evidence to establish that element. Thus, the jury would have had to rely on the hearsay testimony in order to reach a conviction on the rape count involving A.M.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">(2) Improper impeachment under Evid.R. 607(A)</p>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">{\u00b6 46} Richcreek further complains that the trial court erred in allowing the prosecutor to impeach A.M.\u2019s recantation without complying with Evid.R. 607(A). While only indirectly a hearsay issue, the prosecutor\u2019s use of A.M.\u2019s contradictory statements in closing argument makes this impeachment issue pertinent to the third assignment of error.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b558-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>{\u00b6 47} EvicLR. 607(A) states:</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">{\u00b6 48} \u201cThe credibility of a witness may be attacked by any party except that the credibility of a witness may be attacked by the party calling the witness by means of a prior inconsistent statement only upon a showing of surprise and affirmative damage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">{\u00b6 49} A party must demonstrate the predicate conditions of surprise and affirmative damage before undertaking to impeach its own witness. <em>State v. Keenan </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 402, 412, 613 N.E.2d 203. \u201cSurprise\u201d is adequately shown \u201cif the testimony is materially inconsistent with the prior written or oral statements <em>and counsel did not have reason to believe that the witness would recant when called to testify.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>State v. Holmes </em>(1987), 30 Ohio St.3d 20, 23-24, 506 N.E.2d 204. See also <em>State v. Blair </em>(1986), 34 Ohio App.3d 6, 9, 516 N.E.2d 240.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">{\u00b6 50} The state responds that because \u201cit appears that the [prosecutor] did not know what [A.M.] would say on the witness stand,\u201d her impeachment questioning was proper. This response is plainly disingenuous, given what the transcript reveals. A.M. was not only a witness the state intended to call, but she also had to be put on the stand forcibly by means of a material-witness arrest warrant. In requesting the warrant, the prosecutor told the court: \u201cShe did leave me a voice mail message several weeks ago after receiving that subpoena indicating that she was not going to be cooperative in testifying.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">{\u00b6 51} Indeed, during A.M.\u2019s direct examination, the prosecutor did not even claim surprise or damage before confronting her with her previous oral and written statements. Yet the intent was obviously to impeach her in-court recantation. Even if damage is assumed, without also showing surprise, the use of these statements violated Evid.R. 607(A), and the court erred in permitting it. <em>State v. Liberatore </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St.2d 583, 588, 433 N.E.2d 561 (finding impeachment improper \u201cwhen there is good reason to believe the witness will decline to testify as desired\u201d). Given the hearsay errors previously identified, we cannot say that this error was harmless. <em>Keenan, </em>66 Ohio St.3d 402, 613 N.E.2d 203; <em>Holmes, </em>30 Ohio St.3d 20, 506 N.E.2d 204. Further, even had the impeachment comported with Evid.R. 607, the court erred in not giving a limiting instruction to circumscribe the jury\u2019s use of the statements to that purpose. See <em>State v. Lewis </em>(1991), 75 Ohio App.3d 689, 697-698, 600 N.E.2d 764.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>(3) A.L.\u2019s extrajudicial statements</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">{\u00b6 52} At trial A.L. testified in detail about the four incidents in which Richcreek assaulted her. Prosecution witnesses King and Butler were then allowed to repeat what she told them for the professed purpose of showing how they responded to the sexual-assault report. Richcreek argues that while A.L.\u2019s statements were admitted for reasons other than the truth of their contents, the prosecutor later switched that use in closing argument, referring to King and Butler\u2019s testimony as if it were further proof in aid of A.L.\u2019s own testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">{\u00b6 53} As it did with the hearsay involving A.M., the state now responds with a different justification for A.L.\u2019s out-of-court statements than that which the prosecutor urged at trial. The state contends that her statements were admissible under Evid.R. 801(D)(1)(b) as prior consistent statements \u201coffered to rebut an express or implied charge against declarant of recent fabrication or improper influence or motive.\u201d In support of this new theory, the state argues that during defense counsel\u2019s opening statement, he attacked A.L.\u2019s credibility; therefore, to refute this challenge, the prosecutor had the right to introduce her prior statements. However, since the state never argued below that these statements comported with the criteria of Evid.R. 801(D)(1)(b), it has waived that argument on appeal. <em>State v. York, </em>115 Ohio App.3d 245, 685 N.E.2d 261; <em>In re Banks, </em>2008-Ohio-2339, 2008 WL 2043231.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">{\u00b6 54} Even assuming this justification had been offered at trial, we find it unavailing for two reasons. First, if an out-of-court statement is admitted under either Evid.R. 801(D)(1)(a) or (b), it becomes <em>substantive evidence </em>in the case-in-chief to prove the elements of the offense. As we have already held with respect to A.M.\u2019s extrajudicial statements, once a statement that would otherwise be pristine hearsay is admitted for some use <em>other than </em>as substantive evidence (i.e., other than for its truth-value), the prosecutor \u201cmust not later assert [such] statements for their truth during closing argument.\u201d <em>Kirk, </em>2010-Ohio-2006, 2010 WL 1818894, at \u00b6 28. During her closing argument here, the prosecutor did exactly that, relying in part on what A.L. told King and Butler as probative of Richcreek\u2019s guilt on the four counts involving her. This was improper and constitutes reversible error. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">{\u00b6 55} The second problem with the state\u2019s current argument is that it misconstrues the requirements of Evid.R. 801(D)(1)(b) in light of the specific assertions made in counsel\u2019s opening statement. By using the disjunctive \u201cor,\u201d the rule distinguishes between a claim of \u201crecent fabrication\u201d and one which asserts an \u201cimproper motive\u201d that existed antecedent to the statements asserted to be consistent.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-9\">{\u00b6 56} Defense counsel stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>{\u00b6 57} \u201cNow I expect the evidence is going to be that [Richcreek] was showered with attention to the exclusion \u2014 to the exclusion of the other girls. * * * [H]e got all the favorable attention and the girls were effectively shunned. * * * I expect the girls\u2019 mother * * * to come in [and] testify at length as to the motive for [A.L.\u2019s] accusation. She\u2019s going to be into the issue of jealousy, and * * * this is not even remotely close to any ordinary sibling jealousy. This is something that has grown over the years and was never addressed and developed to a pathological level in this family. I think the evidence is going to show that it drove [both sisters] wild with jealousy and rage and that is, in fact, the motivation for these accusations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">{\u00b6 58} Counsel was asserting that the motive to fabricate (allegedly \u201cpathological\u201d jealousy over favorable parental treatment) developed years earlier, well <em>before </em>A.L. made her claims to King and Butler in February 2009. Evid.R. 801(D)(1)(b) does not allow <em>all </em>prior statements; rather, admission is restricted to \u201cconsistent statements] made by the witness prior to the time of the suggested invention <em>or of the emergence of the motive or influence to invent or falsify, </em>as tending to rebut the charge [of fabrication].\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Motorists Mut. Ins. Co. v. Vance </em>(1985), 21 Ohio App.3d 205, 207, 486 N.E.2d 1206.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-9\">{\u00b6 59} The rule contains a timing component for prior statements in relation to a charge of \u201cimproper motive.\u201d That is, only prior consistent statements made <em>before </em>the alleged motive to fabricate arose are admissible. <em>Vance. </em>The issue is not when the charge was made, but when the improper motive arose. If \u201cthe facts giving rise to the motive to falsify existed <em>before </em>the disputed consistent statements,\u201d then Evid.R. 801(D)(1)(b) does not apply and the statements are inadmissible. <em>State v. Smith </em>(1986), 34 Ohio App.3d 180, 191, 517 N.E.2d 933; see also <em>State v. Nichols </em>(1993), 85 Ohio App.3d 65, 71, 619 N.E.2d 80, and <em>State v. Lopez </em>(1993), 90 Ohio App.3d 566, 578-579, 630 N.E.2d 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-10\">{\u00b6 60} The state contends that a general challenge to the victim\u2019s credibility by defense counsel permits the prosecutor to introduce her prior consistent statements, citing <em>State v. Britta, </em>11th Dist. No. 2009-L-017, 2010-Ohio-971, 2010 WL 891357, and other cases. While it is true that those cases have so held, their holdings are context-specific to the asserted motive, fabrication, or improper influence and the timing of the prior statements involved. In <em>Britta, </em>for example, defense counsel suggested that the victim\u2019s family had \u201cconcocted a story\u201d of sexual abuse and manipulated the course of the police investigation. Id. at \u00b6 86-91. Yet <em>Britta </em>supports our analysis of Evid.R. 801(D)(1)(b) here, in that the Eleventh District excluded a nurse\u2019s testimony recounting what the victim said during an interview because the statements were made <em>after </em>the improper family influence occurred. Id. at \u00b6 96.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>{\u00b6 61} Moreover, it would vitiate the rule to hold that anything said in an opening statement that touches on the declarant\u2019s axiopisty automatically makes <em>all </em>her prior statements admissible. Thus, this new argument is unpersuasive even if it had been raised below.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It was reversible error to have allowed King and Butler to repeat A.L.\u2019s out-of-court statements for a nonhearsay purpose but then to permit those same statements to be used or relied on for a substantive purpose. <em>Kirk, </em>2010-Ohio-2006, 2010 WL 1818894.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\">(4) Hearsay in Documents</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">{\u00b6 62} On appeal, Richcreek maintains that it was prejudicial error for the court to admit A.L.\u2019s police report (Exhibit 8) and the search warrant that Detective Gross executed at Richcreek\u2019s residence (Exhibit 3). Although defense counsel failed to object to the admission of these documents during trial, a reviewing court has discretion to engage in a plain-error review under Crim.R. 52(B). <em>State v. Gross, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 121, 2002-Ohio-5524, 776 N.E.2d 1061, \u00b6 45; <em>State v. Endicott </em>(1994), 99 Ohio App.3d 688, 694, 651 N.E.2d 1024. See also Evid.R.103(D). Such a review involves three conditions:</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">{\u00b6 63} \u201c \u2018First, there must be an error, <em>i.e., </em>a deviation from the legal rule. * * * Second, the error must be plain. To be \u201cplain\u201d within the meaning of Crim.R. 52(B), an error must be an \u201cobvious\u201d defect in the trial proceedings. * * * Third, the error must have affected \u201csubstantial rights.\u201d We have interpreted this aspect of the rule to mean that the trial court\u2019s error must have affected the outcome of the trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Payne, </em>114 Ohio St.3d 502, 2007-Ohio-4642, 873 N.E.2d 306, \u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-9\">{\u00b6 64} We will address AL.\u2019s police report first. This report contained her descriptions of the alleged rapes of January 30 and February 2, 2009. To Richcreek\u2019s argument, the state offers two responses. First, it urges that A.L.\u2019s statements in the report were prior consistent statements under Evid.R. 801(D)(1)(b) and were properly admitted on that basis. This contention is without merit for the same reasons that King and Butler\u2019s hearsay testimony was inadmissible under that rule. Second, the state replies that even if the report was inadmissible, it was merely \u201ccumulative in nature\u201d and harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-10\">{\u00b6 65} Evid.R. 803(8)(b) states:</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>{\u00b6 66} \u201cRecords, reports, statements, or data compilations, in any form, of public offices or agencies, setting forth * * * (b) matters observed pursuant to duty imposed by law as to which matters there was a duty to report, excluding, however, in criminal cases matters observed by police officers and other law enforcement personnel, unless offered by defendant, unless the sources of information or other circumstances indicate lack of trustworthiness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">{\u00b6 67} Here, A.L.\u2019s trial testimony did not differ in any material respect from the description she provided in her report. Detective Gross did not make the report. It is a handwritten statement by A.L. describing two of the four alleged rapes. She was plainly under no official \u201cduty\u201d to give any statement, a condition that Evid.R. 803(8) requires. <em>State v. York, </em>115 Ohio App.3d at 248-249, 685 N.E.2d 261; <em>State v. Settles </em>(Sept. 30, 1998), 3d Dist. No. 13-97-50, 1998 WL 667635. Yet her statements in the report were used for their substantive truth-value and were thus hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">{\u00b6 68} Unless offered by the defendant, Evid.R. 803(8) expressly prohibits the state from using in its case-in-chief statements found in police records or reports (or portions thereof) from persons under no official duty to furnish or record information, such as witnesses or victims. <em>York; State v. Spinks </em>(1992), 79 Ohio App.3d 720, 729, 607 N.E.2d 1130.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">{\u00b6 69} Here, defense counsel plainly did not \u201coffer\u201d the report, despite using it during cross-examination. That impeachment use, however, did not thereby render it admissible. Combined with the improper hearsay testimony from King and Butler, the erroneous admission of the report was not \u201ccumulative,\u201d but prejudicial. It reinforced, by means of an official document, the content of her statements there and those that King and Butler repeated. <em>State v. McKinney, </em>3d Dist. No. 4-04-12, 2004-Ohio-5518, 2004 WL 2334318, \u00b6 53-55.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">{\u00b6 70} We turn now to the admission of the search warrant. This hearsay challenge is directed to Gross\u2019s affidavit on which the search warrant is based. Richcreek argues that it contains double inadmissible hearsay: Gross\u2019s own out-of-court narrative, which repeats A.L.\u2019s accusatory statements. Rich-creek contends that he was prejudiced because the \u201cformalized setting\u201d of the detective\u2019s affidavit and the judge\u2019s approval of the warrant amplified the credibility of A.L.\u2019s claims. The state responds that whether the judge\u2019s signature enhanced the warrant\u2019s probative value in the jury\u2019s eyes is speculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-9\">{\u00b6 71} In <em>State v. Williams </em>(1996), 115 Ohio App.3d 24, 684 N.E.2d 358, the Eleventh Appellate District found prejudicial error in the trial court\u2019s admission of a search warrant and the supporting transcript at the jury trial of a murder defendant. The warrant had been executed during a drug raid at the defendant\u2019s residence in which a gunfight with police ensued. Both documents contained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>hearsay statements about a drug informant. No cautionary instruction was given to the jury restricting how such statements were to be considered. Id. at 39, 684 N.E.2d 358.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">{\u00b6 72} The <em>Williams </em>court stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">{\u00b6 73} \u201cA review of the search warrant and the transcript indicates that both documents had many statements which could possibly have been prejudicial to appellant. For example, the affidavit accompanying the search warrant contained statements indicating that the officers\u2019 informant had twice purchased crack cocaine at the Oak residence from a male named \u2018Jodi.\u2019 Without the cautionary instruction, there is the possibility that the jury might have considered the statements for the truth of the matter asserted, <em>i.e., </em>the jury could have concluded that the statements showed that appellant was a person of bad character who, for that reason alone, was guilty of the charged offenses.\u201d Id. at 39, 684 N.E.2d 358.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">{\u00b6 74} Ordinarily Gross\u2019s own statements in the affidavit that merely explained the actions he took based on what he learned during his investigation would not be hearsay. See, e.g., <em>State v. Thomas </em>(1980), 61 Ohio St.2d 223, 232, 400 N.E.2d 401. However, AL.\u2019s allegations, which Gross repeated in the affidavit, were hearsay and went wholly to the elements of the rape counts involving her. Without some cautionary instruction from the court restricting the jury\u2019s use of these statements to a nonsubstantive purpose, the warrant and the attached affidavit should not have been admitted. Evid.R. 105; <em>Williams, </em>supra. The potential for prejudice was heightened because A.L.\u2019s accusations appear in a document that exudes an official formality and bears the imprimatur of a judge\u2019s signature.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">{\u00b6 75} Based upon the foregoing, we further conclude that the errors in admitting AL.\u2019s police report and the search warrant affected a substantial right, and thus plain error occurred. <em>Payne, </em>114 Ohio St.3d 502, 2007-Ohio-4642, 873 N.E.2d 306.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b563-9\">{\u00b6 76} Generally, the admission of an isolated hearsay statement may be deemed harmless error. Evid.R. 103(A); Crim.R. 52(A). This conclusion is typically appropriate when there is substantial and independent <em>admissible </em>evidence, other than the hearsay, to prove the elements of the crime. However, notwithstanding AL.\u2019s own testimony, the amount of inadmissible, or improperly used, hearsay in this case is significant. Multiple witnesses who repeat the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>extrajudicial statements in court merely create a prejudicial reinforcing effect. A disputed statement is not made true simply because it is repeated. Cf. <em>State v. Butcher, </em>170 Ohio App.3d 52, 2007-Ohio-118, 866 N.E.2d 13, \u00b6 78-79.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">{\u00b6 77} Given the errors identified herein, we turn to the final question of whether, in totality, the erroneously admitted hearsay was prejudicial or harmless. In <em>State v. Kidder </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 279, 513 N.E.2d 311, the Ohio Supreme Court established the standard applicable in criminal cases:</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">{\u00b6 78} \u201cIn the final analysis, the evidence in favor of conviction, absent the hearsay, must be so overwhelming that the admission of those statements was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Id. at 284, 513 N.E.2d 311.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">{\u00b6 79} On the four counts involving A.L., the admissible evidence was not overwhelming. The determining issue here was A.L.\u2019s credibility. There were no eyewitnesses and no independent proof of her claims. The forensic analysis on her clothing revealed nothing. Other physical evidence, such as the bruising noted in the composite hospital report, was ambiguous, given the admitted \u201cwrestling\u201d in which she and Richcreek apparently engaged. The effect of the hearsay evidence, through the conduits of King and Butler and the documents, was to bolster her credibility. <em>State v. Yarber, </em>102 Ohio App.3d 185, 656 N.E.2d 1322. On the record here, we cannot conclude that the improper hearsay was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Kidder, </em>32 Ohio St.3d 279, 513 N.E.2d 311.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-8\">{\u00b6 80} Accordingly, to the extent of our foregoing rulings on the hearsay issues involving both A.M. and A.L., we find the third assignment of error well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-9\">{\u00b6 81} Richcreek\u2019s first and second assignments of error state:</p>\n<p id=\"b564-10\">{\u00b6 82} \u201cI. The trial court erred in denying appellant\u2019s Crim.R. 29 motion for acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-11\">{\u00b6 83} \u201cII. The verdict concerning the sole count of rape in case number 09CR124 was not supported by sufficient evidence in violation of appellant\u2019s right to due process of law as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article I, Section 16 of the Ohio Constitution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b564-12\">{\u00b6 84} These assignments challenge the sufficiency of the evidence to support Richcreek\u2019s conviction only as to the rape count involving A.M. (case No. 2009CR0124). A motion for acquittal under Crim.R. 29(A) is reviewed de novo by this court as a question of law. <em>State v. Thompkins </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 386-387, 678 N.E.2d 541. The motion is tested against the same standard used to determine whether a verdict is supported by sufficient evidence. <em>State v. Tenace, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 255, 2006-Ohio-2417, 847 N.E.2d 386, \u00b6 37; <em>State v. Nuhfer, </em>6th Dist. No L-07-1125, 2009-Ohio-1474, 2009 WL 806905, \u00b625. As we stated in <em>Nuhfer: </em>\u201c[T]he court must determine whether the evidence submitted is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>legally sufficient to support all of the elements of the offense charged. * * * The test is, viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, could any rational trier of fact have found the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">{\u00b6 85} R.C. 2907.02(A)(2) provides: \u201cNo person shall engage in sexual conduct with another when the offender purposely compels the other person to submit by force or threat of force.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">{\u00b6 86} R.C. 2901.01(A)(1) defines \u201cforce\u201d as \u201cany violence, compulsion, or constraint physically exerted by any means upon or against a person or thing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">{\u00b6 87} On the force component of R.C. 2907.02(A)(2), the Ohio Supreme Court has held that \u201c \u2018[floree need not be overt and physically brutal * * *. As long as it can be shown that the rape victim\u2019s will was overcome by fear or duress, the forcible element of rape can be established.\u2019 \u201d State <em>v. Eskridge </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 56, 58-59, 526 N.E.2d 304.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">{\u00b6 88} Richcreek contends that because no admissible evidence was presented on the element of \u201cforce\u201d (or \u201cthreat of force\u201d) on the charge involving A.M., his motion for acquittal should have been granted. The state counters that sufficient evidence for that element can be found in the testimony of Bissett and Bernhard \u2014 testimony that the state presently contends is admissible as substantive proof under one of the hearsay exceptions previously discussed. Both parties, in arguing for and against sufficiency, are essentially rearguing their positions on the primary admissibility of A.M.\u2019s out-of-court statements in relation to the force element. Given our ruling on that issue under the third assignment of error, the state\u2019s position on sufficiency is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-9\">{\u00b6 89} The hearsay testimony from Bissett, Bernhard, and the other four prosecution witnesses, as we have said, was admitted in the state\u2019s case-in-chief for the nonsubstantive purpose articulated by the prosecutor, rendering it nonhearsay for that purpose only. As received, their repetition of her statements had no substantive evidentiary value going to the elements of the offense. A.M. might have given sufficient substantive testimony about her alleged rape, but once on the stand she denied that forcible intercourse had occurred. The prosecutor then attempted (albeit improperly) to impeach her credibility with these same extrajudicial statements. While impeaching statements are not hearsay, neither are they substantive proof. <em>State v. Kline, </em>11 Ohio App.3d, at 211, 464 N.E.2d 159; <em>State v. Parsons, </em>2004-Ohio-2216, 2004 WL 937287, at \u00b6 35. The particular testimony cited by the state does not establish the element of force. It could not be considered for its truth when admitted or relied upon later as proving that element. <em>Kirk, </em>2010-Ohio-2006, 2010 WL 1818894. Thus, without affirmative proof of forcible sexual conduct, the evidence on the rape count <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>involving A.M. was insufficient to convict. It follows that the trial court erred in denying Richcreek\u2019s Crim.R. 29 motion for acquittal on that sole count.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">{\u00b6 90} Accordingly, the first and second assignments of error are well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">{\u00b6 91} The fifth assignment of error states:</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">{\u00b6 92} \u201cV. The trial court erred in admitting testimony concerning a police officer\u2019s opinion of the truthfulness of the appellant when questioned about the allegations of rape.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">{\u00b6 93} The evidentiary issue on which the fifth assignment is based arises from Detective Gross\u2019s execution of the search warrant at Richcreek\u2019s residence. The warrant sought items of evidence supporting A.L.\u2019s allegations. During the search, Gross encountered Richcreek in his room in the basement. A stun gun, allegedly used to threaten one of the victims, was seized there. The testimony to which defense counsel objected pertained to Gross\u2019s conversation with Richcreek during the search of his room. Specifically, Gross testified:</p>\n<p id=\"b566-9\">{\u00b6 94} \u201cQ. You indicated you had an opportunity to speak with [Richcreek]?</p>\n<p id=\"b566-10\">{\u00b6 95} \u201cA. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-11\">{\u00b6 96} \u201cQ. And what, what did you discuss with [him]?</p>\n<p id=\"b566-12\">{\u00b6 97} \u201cA. Explained to him the [rape] allegation that had been made by one of the girls, didn\u2019t specifically go into which child it was that had made the allegation. He denied it. <em>Asked him why somebody would make that type of an allegation to hurt him if it\u2019s not a true allegation. He walked around that conversation and denied having sex with any of the girls.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b566-13\">{\u00b6 98} Gross further testified that Richcreek admitted that \u201che does wrestle with the girls.\u201d On redirect examination, Gross testified:</p>\n<p id=\"b566-14\">{\u00b6 99} \u201cQ. Can you describe [Richcreek\u2019s] body actions when you were executing a search warrant in the basement?</p>\n<p id=\"b566-15\">{\u00b6 100} \u201cA. Moved quite a bit. * * * <em>[JJust his actions to me from people that I\u2019ve interviewed over the years and my training indicate that he was being deceptive with me, and that he was more being providing half truths </em>[sic].\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b566-16\">{\u00b6 101} Counsel\u2019s objection here was overruled. Gross was further permitted to testify:</p>\n<p id=\"b566-17\">{\u00b6 102} \u201cA. * * * [Richcreek] was moving around. He was looking away. He was very vague with his answers. <em>And in my experience </em>it was, it wasn\u2019t one where he was looking eye to eye and trying to make contact and trying to convey his message. <em>He was deceptive. He was looking away and being very vague and general about answers that he was providing.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>{\u00b6 103} Richcreek contends that this testimony essentially told the jury that as an experienced police officer, Gross believed that Richcreek was lying in denying the rape claim, leaving the jury to infer that the claim was true. In response, the state suggests that even if there was error in allowing such testimony, it \u201cwas harmless error in light of the overwhelming evidence [of] Richcreek\u2019s guilt.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">{\u00b6 104} In <em>State v. Boston </em>(1989), 46 Ohio St.3d 108, 545 N.E.2d 1220, the Ohio Supreme Court held that a witness may not express his belief or opinion as to the credibility of another witness. Id. at 128-129, 545 N.E.2d 1220. <em>Boston </em>involved allegations of sexual assault on a child in which the treating physician was allowed to state her opinion of the child\u2019s veracity, in effect \u201cdeclaring] that [the child] was truthful in her statements.\u201d Id. The Supreme Court found that \u201cthe admission of this testimony was not only improper \u2014 it was egregious, prejudicial and constitutes reversible error.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">{\u00b6 105} Later, in <em>State v. Davis, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 404, 2008-Ohio-2, 880 N.E.2d 31, the Supreme Court again held that a detective\u2019s testimony that the accused \u201c \u2018was being very deceptive\u2019 \u201d was inadmissible. Id. at \u00b6 121-123 (citing Boston).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">{\u00b6 106} In <em>State v. Hensley, </em>6th Dist. No. L-03-1005, 2005-Ohio-664, 2005 WL 388699, this court found reversible error when a police detective testified about the truthfulness of a witness, stating:</p>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">{\u00b6 107} \u201cIt is well-established that a witness may not express his or her belief or opinion as to the credibility of another witness. * * * When a witness expresses an opinion as to the veracity of another witness, it has the effect of acting as a \u2018litmus test\u2019 on the key issue in the case and infringing on the role of the fact finder, \u2018who is charged with making determinations of veracity and credibility.\u2019 * * * <em>This is particularly true when an investigating police officer expresses an opinion as to whether a witness is being truthful.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Id. at \u00b6 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-9\"> {\u00b6 108} Given the foregoing precedent, it was error to permit Gross to testify that Richcreek was being \u201cdeceptive\u201d and thus impliedly untruthful. The state is correct that <em>Boston </em>violations are subject to harmless-error review under Crim.R. 52(A). <em>State v. Allen, </em>8th Dist. No. 92482, 2010-Ohio-9, 2010 WL 27548, \u00b6 50-51. However, we cannot say beyond a reasonable doubt that allowing the jury to hear Gross\u2019s testimony regarding Richcreek\u2019s \u201cdeceptive\u201d responses was harmless. For better or worse, jurors view police officers as expert witnesses and give substantial weight to their opinions, particularly where the opinion is couched in terms of \u201cprevious experience with other cases.\u201d <em>State v. Kovac, </em>150 Ohio App.3d 676, 2002-Ohio-6784, 782 N.E.2d 1185, \u00b6 38 (quoting <em>State v. Miller </em>(Jan. 26, 2001), 2d Dist. No. 18102, 2001 WL 62793). <em>Boston </em>violations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>are more likely to be prejudicial in the context of a jury trial where the case \u201c[is] essentially a \u2018credibility contest\u2019 between the victim and the defendant without independent evidence of the alleged crimes.\u201d <em>Kovac </em>at \u00b6 40; <em>State v. Burrell </em>(1993), 89 Ohio App.3d 737, 746, 627 N.E.2d 605.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">{\u00b6 109} In this case, there were two victims. As Gross indicated in the testimony quoted above, he was intentionally vague about which sister he was referring to when he confronted Richcreek with the rape allegation. Arguably, his \u201cdeceptiveness\u201d opinion affected the counts involving both girls. However, given our ruling that the evidence on A.M.\u2019s count was insufficient to support a conviction, it is a moot point whether Gross\u2019s opinion further prejudiced the jury on that count. But to the extent the jury inferred truthful substance from his opinion as to the four counts involving A.L., its effect was prejudicial, for without it and without King and Butler\u2019s hearsay testimony, the prosecution\u2019s case rested on A.L.\u2019s credibility. Accordingly, the fifth assignment of error is well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">{\u00b6 110} The fourth, sixth, seventh, and eighth assignments of error state:</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">{\u00b6 111} \u201cIV. Appellant received ineffective assistance of counsel in violation of his rights under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and Article I, Section 10 of the Constitution of the State of Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-8\">{\u00b6 112} \u201cVI. The trial court erred in imposing consecutive sentences upon appellant by making R.C. 2929.14(E)(4) findings in violation of <em>State v. Foster.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b568-9\">{\u00b6 113} \u201cVII. The trial court erred in imposing costs in the sentencing entries where it failed to do so orally at the sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-10\">{\u00b6 114} \u201cVIII. Appellant was deprived of a fair trial because of cumulative error in violation of his rights under the Fifth, Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and the corresponding provisions of the Ohio Constitution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b568-11\">{\u00b6 115} Given our previous disposition of the first, second, third, and fifth assigned errors, the remaining assignments have been rendered moot and need not be addressed.
