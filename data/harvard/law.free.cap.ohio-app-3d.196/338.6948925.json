Johnson, appeals his conviction and sentence entered in the Richland County Court of Common Pleas on one count of tampering with evidence, one count of tampering with records, and one count of identity theft, following a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-11\">{\u00b6 2} Appellee is the state of Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-12\">STATEMENT OF THE FACTS AND CASE</p>\n<p id=\"b375-13\">{\u00b6 3} In the early morning hours of September 3, 2009, the Mansfield Police Department stopped appellant in his Chrysler 300 for having no front license plate and no illumination on his rear license plate. Appellant was found to be driving under suspension and was arrested. A 16-year-old female was a passenger in appellant\u2019s vehicle. She was found to have consumed alcohol and was returned to her mother. With no one at the scene to drive the car, it had to be towed. Pursuant to Mansfield Police Department policies, Sergeant Doug Noblet and Officer Nelson Kilgore conducted an inventory search of the vehicle. As a result of the search, the officers discovered what was later determined to be 55.46 grams of powder cocaine in the sunglasses compartment of appellant\u2019s car, near the seat where appellant had been sitting.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>{\u00b6 4} After appellant\u2019s arrest, the Richland County prosecuting attorney received a notarized statement from a person claiming to be Andre Martin and professing to be the owner of the drugs in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">{\u00b6 5} Upon receipt of the statement, Assistant Prosecuting Attorney Brent Robinson asked the office investigator, Richard Duffey, to question Andre Martin in person.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">{\u00b6 6} On October 22, 2009, appellant personally escorted \u201cAndre Martin\u201d to the Richland County Prosecutor\u2019s Office.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">{\u00b6 7} In his statement to Duffey, \u201cAndre Martin\u201d stated that he saw the baggie in question fall out of someone\u2019s pocket during an altercation, that he picked it up thinking it was money, and that he walked for a while before he pulled it out of his pocket and realized that it was drugs. He stated that he then walked to the home of his friend, appellant, and asked to borrow appellant\u2019s car. He stated that he drove the car around but provided no details as to where he went or what he did. Finally, he claimed that he returned the car to appellant and forgot to take the baggie of drugs that he had placed in the sunglasses compartment for safekeeping. He advised Duffey that the amount of cocaine was not \u201ca handful\u201d that he did not really know how many bags there were, that he did not know how big it was, that he did not know how much it was, and that he did not know how much it weighed.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">{\u00b6 8} Another investigator, Cindi Powers, thought that she recognized the man in the lobby, but could not put a name to the face. Powers checked photographs on the OHLEG database and established that the man was actually Willie Martin, not Andre Martin. Powers informed Duffey and Robinson of her findings. They agreed that the \u201cAndre Martin\u201d who had been in their office did not look like the real Andre Martin. It was later discovered that the person claiming to be Andre Martin was in fact Willie Martin, Andre Martin\u2019s brother.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-9\">{\u00b6 9} As a result of the above events, both appellant Nayyohn Johnson and Willie Martin were indicted by the Richland County Grand Jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-10\">{\u00b6 10} Appellant\u2019s indictment included the following charges:</p>\n<p id=\"b376-11\">{\u00b6 11} Count One: drug possession in violation of R.C. 2925.11(A);</p>\n<p id=\"b376-12\">{\u00b6 12} Count Two: obstruction of justice, in violation of R.C. 2921.32(A)(5);</p>\n<p id=\"b376-13\">{\u00b6 13} Count Three: tampering with evidence, in violation of R.C. 2921.12(A)(2);</p>\n<p id=\"b376-15\">{\u00b6 14} Count Four: tampering with evidence, in violation of R.C. 2921.12(A)(2),</p>\n<p id=\"b376-16\">{\u00b6 15} Count Five: tampering with records, in violation of R.C. 2913.42(A)(1);</p>\n<p id=\"b376-17\">{\u00b6 16} Count Six: identity fraud, in violation of R.C. 2913.49(B)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>{\u00b6 17} Appellant filed a motion to suppress evidence of the drugs. The trial court found that the drugs were revealed during a lawful inventory search of appellant\u2019s vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">{\u00b6 18} Appellant\u2019s trial commenced on July 12, 2010, and continued on July 18, July 15, and July 16, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">{\u00b6 19} At trial, the state of Ohio presented testimony from Sgt. Doug Noblet, Officer Nelson Kilgore, and Metrich Officer Perry Wheeler from the Mansfield Police Department, Anthony Tambaseo of the Mansfield Forensic Science Laboratory, appellant\u2019s former defense counsel, attorney Dale Musilli, investigator Richard Duffey, investigator Lucinda Powers, Willie Martin, and Willie Martin\u2019s \u25a0wife, Debbie Martin.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">{\u00b6 20} At trial, in addition to hearing the testimony of the Mansfield police officers, investigators and forensic scientist, the jury heard testimony from appellant\u2019s former defense counsel, Dale Musilli, who testified that appellant had brought Willie Martin to his office, that Willie Martin presented himself as Andre Martin, and that Martin informed him that the cocaine found in appellant\u2019s car actually belonged to him. He testified that based on Martin\u2019s statements to him, he had Martin prepare a written statement. Musilli explained that he then had his assistant notarize the statement and then he faxed it to the prosecutor\u2019s office that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">{\u00b6 21} The jury also heard from Willie Martin, who testified that he was not named or known as Andre Martin and that his \u201cconfession\u201d had been false. He testified that he had made a deal with appellant to have appellant forgive a $1,200 debt he owed appellant, plus receive an additional $5,000, if he would tell the police that the drugs found in appellant\u2019s car were his. He explained that the reason he got the details about the drugs wrong was because he had never actually seen the drugs. He further testified that he was actually in Indianapolis, Indiana, at the time of appellant\u2019s traffic stop and that he had been there for months. Willie Martin\u2019s wife Debbie corroborated that he had been in Indianapolis.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-9\">{\u00b6 22} Appellant produced five witnesses to attempt to rebut Willie Martin\u2019s claim that he was in Indiana on the day of the car stop. All the defense witnesses were friends and family of appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-10\">{\u00b6 23} At the conclusion of the state\u2019s case, the trial court dismissed the obstruction-of-justice count, finding that appellant could not legally be guilty of obstructing justice in scheming to cover up something that appellant himself had done.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-11\">{\u00b6 24} After hearing all the evidence and arguments, the jury found appellant guilty of one count of tampering with evidence, a felony of the third degree, one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>count of tampering with records, a felony of the third degree, and one count of identity fraud, a felony of the fifth degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">{\u00b6 25} Citing appellant\u2019s extensive criminal history, which included seven prior felony convictions, the trial court sentenced appellant to two years on the tampering-with-evidence charge and one year concurrent on the counts of tampering with records and identity theft, for an aggregate sentence of three years in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">{\u00b6 26} Appellant now appeals to this court, assigning the following errors for review:</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">{\u00b6 27} \u201cI. Appellant\u2019s conviction for Counts III, V, and VI are contrary to the manifest weight and sufficiency of evidence presented at trial, thus denying appellant a fair trial and due process of law under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution and under Article 1, Section 16 of the Ohio Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">{\u00b6 28} \u201cII. Appellant\u2019s conviction and sentence for both Count III (tampering with evidence) and Count V (tampering with records) constitute Double Jeopardy as prohibited by the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and Section 10 Article 1 of the Ohio Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-9\">{\u00b6 29} \u201cIII. Appellant was deprived of Due Process as guaranteed by the Ohio and U.S. Constitutions, as a result of ineffective assistance of counsel, or in the alternative, plain error.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b378-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b378-11\">{\u00b6 30} In his first assignment of error, appellant claims that his convictions are against the manifest weight and sufficiency of the evidence. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-12\">{\u00b6 31} In determining whether a verdict is against the manifest weight of the evidence, the appellate court acts as a 13th juror and in \u201c \u2018reviewing the entire record, weighs the evidence and all reasonable inferences, considers the credibility of witnesses and determines whether in resolving conflicts in the evidence, the jury clearly lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the conviction must be reversed and a new trial ordered.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Thompkins </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 387, 678 N.E.2d 541, quoting <em>State v. Martin </em>(1983), 20 Ohio App.3d 172, 175, 485 N.E.2d 717.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-13\">{\u00b6 32} An appellate court\u2019s function when reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence is to determine whether after viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Jenks </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 574 N.E.2d 492, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">{\u00b6 33} In the instant case, appellant was convicted of aiding or abetting another in tampering with evidence, aiding or abetting another in tampering with records, and identity fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">{\u00b6 34} The elements of tampering with evidence are set forth in R.C. 2921.12, which provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">{\u00b6 35} \u201c(A) No person, knowing that an official proceeding or investigation is in progress, or is about to be or likely to be instituted, shall do any of the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b379-8\">{\u00b6 36} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b379-9\">{\u00b6 37} \u201c(2) Make, present, or use any record, document, or thing, knowing it to be false and with purpose to mislead a public official who is or may be engaged in such proceeding or investigation, or with purpose to corrupt the outcome of any such proceeding or investigation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b379-10\">{\u00b6 38} The elements of tampering with records are set forth in R.C. 2913.42(A)(1), which provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b379-11\">{\u00b6 39} \u201c(A) No person, knowing the person has no privilege to do so, and with purpose to defraud or knowing that the person is facilitating a fraud, shall do any of the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b379-12\">{\u00b6 40} \u201c(1) Falsify, destroy, remove, conceal, alter, deface, or mutilate any writing, computer software, data, or record.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b379-13\">{\u00b6 41} The elements of identity fraud are set forth in R.C. 2913.49(B)(1), which provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b379-14\">{\u00b6 42} \u201c(A) As used in this section, \u201cpersonal identifying information\u201d includes, but is not limited to, the following: the name, address, telephone number, driver\u2019s license, driver\u2019s license number, commercial driver\u2019s license, commercial driver\u2019s license number, state identification card, state identification card number, social security card, social security number, birth certificate, place of employment, employee identification number, mother\u2019s maiden name, demand deposit account number, savings account number, money market account number, mutual fund account number, other financial account number, personal identification number, password, or credit card number of a living or dead individual.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-15\">{\u00b6 43} \u201c(B) No person, without the express or implied consent of the other person, shall use, obtain, or possess any personal identifying information of another person with intent to do either of the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b379-16\">{\u00b6 44} \u201c(1) Hold the person out to be the other person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>{\u00b6 45} Based on the testimony of Musilli and Willie Martin, as set forth in detail above in the recitation of the facts, the jury in this case could have reasonably concluded that appellant aided and/or abetted Willie Martin in committing the crimes of tampering with evidence, tampering with records, and identity fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">{\u00b6 46} Martin\u2019s testimony alone regarding the use of his brother\u2019s identity, the preparation of the false written statement, and the false information given to the investigators presented the jury with sufficient evidence to find that appellant had committed the crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">{\u00b6 47} Viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, we conclude that a reasonable person could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant had committed the crimes of tampering with evidence, tampering with records, and identity fraud. We hold, therefore, that the state met its burden of production regarding each element of the crime and, accordingly, there was sufficient evidence to support appellant\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">{\u00b6 48} \u201cA fundamental premise of our criminal trial system is that \u2018the <em>jury </em>is the lie detector.\u2019 <em>United States v. Barnard, </em>490 F.2d 907, 912 (C.A.9 1973) (emphasis added), cert, denied, 416 U.S. 959, 94 S.Ct. 1976, 40 L.Ed.2d 310 (1974). Determining the weight and credibility of witness testimony, therefore, has long been held to be the \u2018part of every case [that] belongs to the jury, who are presumed to be fitted for it by their natural intelligence and their practical knowledge of men and the ways of men.\u2019 <em>Aetna Life Ins. Co. v. Ward, </em>140 U.S. 76, 88, 11 S.Ct. 720, 724-725, 35 L.Ed. 371 (1891).\u201d <em>United States v. Scheffer </em>(1997), 523 U.S. 303, 313, 118 S.Ct. 1261, 1266-1267, 140 L.Ed.2d 413.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">{\u00b6 49} Appellant cross-examined the state\u2019s witness and further put on his own witnesses in an attempt to rebut the state\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-9\">{\u00b6 50} The weight to be given to the evidence and the credibility of the witnesses are issues for the trier of fact. <em>State v. Jamison </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St.3d 182, 552 N.E.2d 180.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-10\">{\u00b6 51} The jury was free to accept or reject any and all of the evidence offered by appellant and the state and assess the witness\u2019s credibility. \u201c \u2018While the jury may take note of the inconsistencies and resolve or discount them accordingly * * * such inconsistencies do not render defendant\u2019s conviction against the manifest weight or sufficiency of the evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Craig </em>(Mar. 23, 2000), Franklin App. No. 99AP739, 2000 WL 297252, quoting <em>State v. Nivens </em>(May 28, 1996), Franklin App. No. 95APA09-1236,1996 WL 284714. Indeed, the jurors need not believe all of a witness\u2019s testimony, but may instead accept only portions of it as true. <em>State v. Raver, </em>Franklin App. No. 02AP-604, 2003-Ohio-958, 2003 WL 723225, at \u00b6 1, citing <em>State v. Antill </em>(1964), 176 Ohio St. 61, 67, 197 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>N.E.2d 548; <em>State v. Burke, </em>Franklin App. No. 02AP-1238, 2003-Ohio-2889, 2003 WL 21291042, citing <em>State v. Caldwell </em>(1992), 79 Ohio App.3d 667, 607 N.E.2d 1096. Although the evidence may have been circumstantial, we note that circumstantial evidence has the same probative value as direct evidence. <em>State v. Jenks </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 574 N.E.2d 492.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">{\u00b6 52} After reviewing the evidence, we cannot say that this is one of the exceptional cases where the evidence weighs heavily against the convictions. The jury did not create a manifest injustice by concluding that appellant was guilty of the crimes charged in the indictment. The jury heard the witnesses, evaluated the evidence, and was convinced of appellant\u2019s guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">{\u00b6 53} We conclude that the trier of fact, in resolving the conflicts in the evidence, did not create a manifest injustice requiring a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">{\u00b6 54} Based on the foregoing, appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is not well taken, and is hereby overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b381-9\">{\u00b6 55} In his second assignment of error, appellant argues that tampering with evidence and tampering with records are allied offenses of similar import and that his convictions on both constitutes double jeopardy. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-10\">{\u00b6 56} R.C. 2941.25 defines allied offenses of similar import as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b381-11\">{\u00b6 57} \u201c(A) Where the same conduct by defendant can be construed to constitute two or more allied offenses of similar import, the indictment or information may contain counts for all such offenses, but the defendant may be convicted of only one.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-12\">{\u00b6 58} \u201c(B) Where the defendant\u2019s conduct constitutes two or more offenses of dissimilar import, or where his conduct results in two or more offenses of the same or similar kind committed separately or with a separate animus as to each, the indictment or information may contain counts for all such offenses, and the defendant may be convicted of all of them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b381-13\">{\u00b6 59} Recently, the Ohio Supreme Court addressed the issue raised herein in <em>State v. Johnson, </em>128 Ohio St.3d 153, 2010-Ohio-6314, 942 N.E.2d 1061, holding as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b381-14\">{\u00b6 60} \u201cUnder R.C. 2941.25, the court must determine prior to sentencing whether the offenses were committed by the same conduct. Thus, the court need not perform any hypothetical or abstract comparison of the offenses at issue in order to conclude that the offenses are subject to merger.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-15\">{\u00b6 61} \u201cIn determining whether offenses are allied offenses of similar import under R.C. 2941.25(A), the question is whether it is possible to commit one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>offense <em>and </em>commit the other with the same conduct, not whether it is possible to commit one <em>without </em>committing the other. <em>[State v.] Blankenship [</em>(1988) ], 38 Ohio St.3d [116] at 119, 526 N.E.2d 816 (Whiteside, J., concurring) (\u2018It is not necessary that both crimes are always committed by the same conduct but, rather, it is sufficient if both offenses <em>can be </em>committed by the same conduct. It is a matter of possibility, rather than certainty, that the same conduct will constitute commission of both offenses.\u2019 [Emphasis sic]). If the offenses correspond to such a degree that the conduct of the defendant constituting commission of one offense constitutes commission of the other, then the offenses are of similar import.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">{\u00b6 62} \u201cIf the multiple offenses can be committed by the same conduct, then the court must determine whether the offenses were committed by the same conduct, i.e., \u2018a single act, committed with a single state of mind.\u2019 <em>[State </em>v.] <em>Brown, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 447, 2008-Ohio-4569, 895 N.E.2d 149, at \u00b6 50 (Lanzinger, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">{\u00b6 63} \u201cIf the answer to both questions is yes, then the offenses are allied offenses of similar import and will be merged.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">{\u00b6 64} \u201cConversely, if the court determines that the commission of one offense will <em>never </em>result in the commission of the other, or if the offenses are committed separately, or if the defendant has separate animus for each offense, then, according to R.C. 2941.25(B), the offenses will not merge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">{\u00b6 65} Based upon the test set forth in <em>Johnson, </em>we do not find tampering with evidence and tampering with records to be allied offenses of similar import. We find that while both offenses could be committed simultaneously, in this case, there was a separate animus for each distinct act committed: the act of informing Musilli that he had found the person who claimed to be the owner of the drugs and escorting that person to Musilli\u2019s office to have him prepare a false statement that was then sent to the prosecutor\u2019s office; and then later escorting Willie Martin to the prosecutor\u2019s office to continue the charade and commit another crime by making a false, taped statement, all the while knowing that Willie Martin was not Andre Martin nor was he the owner of the drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-9\">{\u00b6 66} Based on the foregoing, we find that the evidence supports a finding that the counts of tampering with evidence and tampering with records were committed as two separate acts, and the court did not err in sentencing appellant to consecutive sentences. We therefore find that appellant\u2019s double-jeopardy rights were not violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-10\">{\u00b6 67} Based on the foregoing, appellant\u2019s second assignment of error is not well taken, and we hereby overrule it.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">{\u00b6 68} In his third assignment of error, appellant claims that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">{\u00b6 69} A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel requires a two-pronged analysis. The first inquiry is whether counsel\u2019s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonable representation involving a substantial violation of any of defense counsel\u2019s essential duties to appellant. The second prong is whether appellant was prejudiced by counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness. <em>Lockhart v. Fretwell </em>(1993), 506 U.S. 364, 113 S.Ct. 838, 122 L.Ed.2d 180; <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674; <em>State v. Bradley </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 538 N.E.2d 373.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">{\u00b6 70} In determining whether counsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness, judicial scrutiny of counsel\u2019s performance must be highly deferential. <em>Bradley, </em>42 Ohio St.3d at 142, 538 N.E.2d 373. Because of the difficulties inherent in determining whether effective assistance of counsel was rendered in any given case, a strong presumption exists that counsel\u2019s conduct fell within the wide range of reasonable, professional assistance. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">{\u00b6 71} In order to warrant a reversal, appellant must additionally show he was prejudiced by counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness. This requires a showing that counsel\u2019s errors were so serious as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial, a trial whose result is reliable. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687, 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674. The burden is upon the defendant to demonstrate that there is a reasonable probability that but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. Id.; <em>Bradley </em>at paragraph three of the syllabus. A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome. <em>Strickland; Bradley.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b383-9\">{\u00b6 72} Appellant asserts trial counsel was ineffective for failing to raise a double-jeopardy argument with regard to Counts III and IV and that the failure amounts to plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-10\">{\u00b6 73} Having found appellant\u2019s double-jeopardy argument to be without merit, we do not find that appellant\u2019s defense counsel\u2019s performance was deficient for failing to raise it.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-11\">{\u00b6 74} Appellant\u2019s third assignment of error is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-12\">{\u00b6 75} For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas, Richland County, Ohio, is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-13\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b383-14\">Gwin, and Edwards, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
