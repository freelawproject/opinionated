Fleenor appeals the judgment of the Pike County Court of Common Pleas, which found R.C. 2315.21(B) to be substantive and, therefore, constitutional. As a result, the trial court bifurcated Fleenor\u2019s trial in accordance with R.C. 2315.21(B). On appeal, Fleenor argues that R.C. 2315.21(B) is procedural and, therefore, unconstitutional. Because R.C. 2315.21(B) clearly and unambiguously regulates the procedure for determining compensatory and punitive damages in a tort action, we agree. Accordingly, we sustain Fleenor\u2019s assignments of error and reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>{\u00b6 2} On September 28, 2007, Fleenor filed a complaint against Sharon H. Karr. Later, in a third amended complaint, Fleenor asserted several tort claims and requested punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">{\u00b6 3} The trial court scheduled a trial for October 18, 2010. On October 12, 2010, Karr filed a motion to \u201cbifurcate the trial on damages in accordance with R.C. \u00a7 2315.21.\u201d Specifically, Karr requested that \u201cthe initial phase of the trial in this matter deal solely with the issues of liability and compensatory damages, if any. [And] in the event the jury returns a verdict as required in \u00a7 2315.21(B)(l)(b)[,] that the issue of punitive damages be tried in a second stage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">{\u00b6 4} On October 18, 2010, the trial court granted Karr\u2019s motion to bifurcate. The trial court found (1) that R.C. 2315.21(B) applies to the present case, (2) that R.C. 2315.21(B) requires bifurcation upon the motion of a party, and (3) that the trial court would not have been inclined to bifurcate the trial but for R.C. 2315.21(B). Additionally, the trial court held that \u201cR.C. 2315.21(B) is substantive and, therefore, does not violate the separation of powers required by the Modern Courts Amendment of 1968, Section 5(B), Article IV of the Ohio Constitution!.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">{\u00b6 5} Fleenor appeals from the trial court\u2019s decision to bifurcate the trial in accordance with R.C. 2315.21(B). In her appellate brief, Fleenor asserts the following two assignments of error: I. \u201cThe trial court committed reversible error by holding R.C. \u00a7 2315.21(B)(1) is constitutional, when R.C. \u00a7 2315.21(B)(1) eliminates the judicial discretion whether to bifurcate a trial into two phases pursuant to Civ.R.42(B) under the authority of the Modern Courts Amendment of 1968, Section 5(B), and Article IV of the Ohio Constitution.\u201d II. \u201cThe trial court committed reversible error by violating Ohio\u2019s separation of powers doctrine when the Court determined the procedural matter of bifurcation of trial was governed by R.C. \u00a7 2315.21(B)(1) instead of Civ.R. 42(B).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b593-8\">{\u00b6 6} Before addressing Fleenor\u2019s assignments of error, we must note the following procedural deficiency. In her appellate brief, Fleenor has failed to separately argue her assignments of error as required by App.R. 16(A)(7). Instead, Fleenor has presented just one argument in support of both assignments of error. And under App.R. 12(A)(2), we may choose to disregard any assignment of error that an appellant fails to separately argue. Therefore, we could exercise our discretionary authority to summarily overrule Fleenor\u2019s assignments of error. See <em>Newman v. Enriquez, </em>171 Ohio App.3d 117, 2007-Ohio-1934, 869 N.E.2d 735, at \u00b6 18; <em>Mtge. Electronic Registrations Sys. v. Mullins, </em>161 Ohio App.3d 12, 2005-Ohio-2303, 829 N.E.2d 326, at \u00b6 22, citing <em>Park v. Ambrose </em>(1993), 85 Ohio App.3d 179,186, 619 N.E.2d 469; <em>State v. Caldwell </em>(1992), 79 Ohio App.3d 667, 677, 607 N.E.2d 1096, fn. 3. We choose, however, to address Fleenor\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>assignments of error in the interest of justice. Furthermore, we will address her assignments of error together.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">{\u00b6 7} Fleenor argues that R.C. 2315.21(B) is procedural and, therefore, unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">{\u00b6 8} We review the constitutionality of a statute on a de novo basis. See, e.g., <em>State v. Anderson, </em>Athens App. No. 09CA18, 2009-Ohio-7014, 2009 WL 5178481, at \u00b6 4. Nevertheless, because all legislative enactments enjoy a strong presumption of constitutionality, \u201cwe must presume the constitutionality of the statute at issue.\u201d <em>State v. Benson </em>(1992), 81 Ohio App.3d 697, 700, 612 N.E.2d 337, citing <em>Sedar v. Knowlton Constr. Co. </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St.3d 193, 199, 551 N.E.2d 938, overruled on other grounds by <em>Brennaman v. R.M.I. Co. </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 460, 639 N.E.2d 425.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">{\u00b6 9} The Eighth District Court of Appeals addressed the constitutionality of R.C. 2315.21(B) in <em>Havel v. Villa St. Joseph, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 94677, 2010-Ohio-5251, 2010 WL 4308208. Thus, to frame the issue, we will quote from <em>Havel </em>at length.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">(\u00b6 10} \u201cSection 5(B), Article IV of the Ohio Constitution states that the Ohio Supreme Court is vested with exclusive authority to \u2018prescribe rules governing practice and procedure in all courts of the state, which rules shall not abridge, enlarge, or modify any substantive right. * * * All laws in conflict with such rules shall be of no further force or effect after such rules have taken effect.\u2019 Pursuant to this constitutional authority, the Supreme Court has adopted the Rules of Civil Procedure, which \u2018prescribe the procedure to be followed in all courts of this state in the exercise of civil jurisdiction.\u2019 Civ.R. 1(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-8\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cWhere a conflict arises between a rule and a statute, the court\u2019s rule will control for procedural matters; the legislature\u2019s statute will control for matters of substantive law. <em>State ex rel. Sapp v. Franklin Cty. Court of Appeals, </em>118 Ohio St.3d 368, 2008-Ohio-2637 [889 N.E.2d 500], \u00b6 28; <em>State v. Slatter </em>(1981), 66 Ohio St.2d 452, 454 [423 N.E.2d 100][.] A statute is invalid and has no force or effect if it conflicts with the Ohio Rules of Civil Procedure. <em>Rockey v. 84 Lumber Co. </em>[ (1993),] 66 Ohio St.3d 221, 223 [611 N.E.2d 789]; <em>In re Coy </em>[(1993),] 67 Ohio St.3d 215, 219 [616 N.E.2d 1105].</p>\n<p id=\"b594-9\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cThe statute at issue here, R.C. 2315.21(B), as amended by S.B. No. 80, effective April 7, 2005, states that \u2018[i]n a tort action that is tried to a jury and in which a plaintiff makes a claim for compensatory damages and a claim for punitive or exemplary damages, upon the motion of any party, the trial of the tort action <em>shall </em>be bifurcated * * *.\u2019 (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b594-10\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cCiv.R. 42(B) of the Ohio Rules of Civil Procedure also addresses bifurcation and provides that \u2018[t]he court, after a hearing, in furtherance of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>convenience or to avoid prejudice, or when separate trials will be conducive to expedition and economy, <em>may </em>order a separate trial of any claim, cross-claim, counterclaim, or third-party claim, or of any separate issue or of any number of claims * * *.\u2019 (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cHence, the statute and the rule are in conflict. One requires bifurcation in a tort action; the other does not.\u201d <em>Havel v. Villa St. Joseph, </em>2010-Ohio-5251, 2010 WL 4308208, at \u00b6 4-8.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">{\u00b6 15} In <em>Havel, </em>the Eighth Appellate District found that R.C. 2315.21(B) is procedural and, therefore, unconstitutional. According to the court, \u201cThe language of R.C. 2315.21(B) plainly and unambiguously purports to regulate bifurcation procedure in trials of tort cases \u2014 a matter already regulated by Civ.R. 42(B). Where a statute conflicts with a rule of procedure, the rule controls on procedural matters. Accordingly, insofar as R.C. 2315.21(B) conflicts with Civ.R. 42(B), we find it unconstitutional, in violation of Section 5(B), Article IV of the Ohio Constitution.\u201d <em>Havel </em>at \u00b6 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">{\u00b6 16} The Tenth District Court of Appeals, however, reached the opposite conclusion in <em>Hanners v. Ho Wah Genting Wire &amp; Cable, </em>Franklin App. No. 09AP-361, 2009-Ohio-6481, 2009 WL 4698618. In reaching its decision, the court relied upon the \u201cstatement of findings and intent\u201d as found in the \u201cuncodified language associated with R.C. 2315.21(B)[.]\u201d Id. at \u00b6 24-25. As a result, the court held the following: \u201c[Biased on the General Assembly\u2019s express intent to create a right of bifurcation to address potential unfairness, we conclude that [R.C. 2315.21(B) ] is substantive. In reaching this conclusion, we do not consider the wisdom of the General Assembly\u2019s public policy choices. * * * Instead, having determined that the General Assembly\u2019s intent was to create a substantive right for certain litigants, we conclude that R.C. 2315.21(B) does not conflict with Civ.R. 42(B) in such a way as to violate the separation of powers required by Section 5(B), Article TV of the Ohio Constitution.\u201d <em>Hanners </em>at \u00b6 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-8\">{\u00b6 17} Because of the conflict between <em>Havel </em>and <em>Hanners, </em>the Supreme Court of Ohio is currently considering the following issue: \u201cWhether R.C. 2315.21(B), as amended by S.B. 80, effective April 7, 2005, is unconstitutional, in violation of Section 5(B), Article IV of the Ohio Constitution, because it is a procedural law that conflicts with Civ.R. 42(B).\u201d <em>Havel v. Villa St. Joseph, </em>127 Ohio St.3d 1530, 2011-Ohio-376, 940 N.E.2d 985. We must address the same issue in the present case. That is, do we agree with <em>Havel </em>or Hanners? Or, in other words, is R.C. 2315.21(B) substantive or procedural?</p>\n<p id=\"b595-9\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cSubstantive laws or rules relate to rights and duties giving rise to a cause of action, while procedural rules concern the \u2018machinery\u2019 for carrying on the suit.\u201d <em>Myers v. Brown, </em>192 Ohio App.3d 670, 2011-Ohio-892, 950 N.E.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>213, at \u00b6 13, citing <em>Norfolk S. RR. Co. v. Bogle, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 455, 2007-Ohio-5248, 875 N.E.2d 919, at \u00b6 16. Thus, to interpret R.C. 2315.21(B) and determine whether the statute is substantive or procedural, \u201c[w]e must first look to the plain language of the statute itself to determine the legislative intent. * * * We apply a statute as it is written when its meaning is unambiguous and definite.\u201d <em>Hubbell v. Xenia, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 77, 2007-Ohio-4839, 873 N.E.2d 878, at \u00b6 11. Furthermore, \u201can unambiguous statute must be applied in a manner consistent with the plain meaning of the statutory language.\u201d Id. That is, if a statute is unambiguous, we need not apply additional principles of statutory construction. See, e.g, <em>State v. Robinson, </em>124 Ohio St.3d 76, 2009-Ohio-5937, 919 N.E.2d 190, at \u00b6 31 (\u201cBecause the language of [the statute] is clear, it is not necessary to resort to other means of interpretation\u201d); <em>Watters v. Ross Cty. Children\u2019s Servs. </em>(Feb. 18, 2000), 4th Dist. Nos. 99CA9 and 99CA12, 2000 WL 228254.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">{\u00b6 19} Here, despite the presumption of constitutionality, we agree with <em>Havel. </em>See also <em>Myers </em>at \u00b6 17 (\u201c[I]nsofar as R.C. 2315.21(B) mandates bifurcation, it is unconstitutional, because it violates Section 5(B), Article IV of the Ohio Constitution\u201d). In our view, \u201cthe legislative intent is clear from the statute: R.C. 2315.21(B) plainly and unambiguously regulates the procedure at trial for determining compensatory and punitive damages in a tort action.\u201d <em>Havel, </em>2010-Ohio-5251, 2010 WL 4308208, at \u00b6 29. Thus, we find that R.C. 2315.21(B) is procedural and, therefore, unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">{\u00b620} Because we agree with <em>Havel, </em>we also find the following: \u201c[T]he mandatory bifurcation language of R.C. 2315.21(B) is unconstitutional because it purports to legislate a strictly procedural matter already addressed by the Civil Rules. It is readily apparent that the language of R.C. 2315.21(B) regarding bifurcation of the damages portion of a trial does not \u2018grant a right or impose a duty that gives rise to a cause of action,\u2019 or even relate to those rights. Instead, the statute clearly and unambiguously specifies \u2018the machinery for carrying on the suit\u2019 by telling courts the \u2018procedural prioritization\u2019 for determining compensatory and punitive damages at trial. Furthermore, it purports to tell courts what evidence a jury may consider, and when \u2014 another area governed by the Civil and Evidence Rules.\u201d <em>Havel, </em>2010-Ohio-5251, 2010 WL 4308208, at \u00b6 27. We further agree that R.C. 2315.21(B) \u201cgives defendants no additional rights, but sets out the procedural rules whereby courts can better protect the rights to a jury and to due process that the parties have always possessed.\u201d <em>Myers, </em>192 Ohio App.3d 670, 2011-Ohio-892, 950 N.E.2d 213, at \u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">{\u00b6 21} Finally, because the legislative intent is clear from the plain language of R.C. 2315.21(B), it would be improper for us to consider additional means of statutory interpretation. Therefore, we agree that \u201cthe Tenth District\u2019s determination in <em>Hanners, </em>reached by reference to sources other than this clear and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>unambiguous statute, conflicts with well-settled rules of statutory construction.\u201d <em>Havel </em>at \u00b6 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">{\u00b6 22} Accordingly, we sustain Fleenor\u2019s two assignments of error and reverse the judgment of the trial court. We remand this cause to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b597-7\">Abele, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"Ae3f\">McFarland, J., dissents.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
