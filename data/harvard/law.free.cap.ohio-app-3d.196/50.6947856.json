Although divorced, the parties were living together at the time of their son\u2019s birth. In June 2005, the parties separated when the mother moved out of the father\u2019s home with D.M. A year later, the mother moved for custody of D.M. Eventually, the parties entered into a shared-parenting plan, which was incorporated into a shared-parenting decree in January 2008. The plan set out a two-week visitation rotation that gave each party equal parenting time. It is undisputed, however, that as written, the shared-parenting plan was never followed by the parties because of the father\u2019s work schedule. As a result, the father had parenting time during the evening once or twice weekly and occasionally on the weekends. In June 2008, the mother moved back into the father\u2019s home; however, later that year, she moved out again with D.M. and went to live with her boyfriend, Thomas H.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-9\">{\u00b6 3} In September 2008, the father started dating Ciera S. The mother has known Ciera since Ciera was four years old; the mother and Ciera\u2019s mother have been friends for over 15 years. In the fall of 2008, Ciera started staying at the father\u2019s house with her two children (a five-year-old daughter and a one-year-old son). She and her children moved into the father\u2019s house in January 2009. Ciera and the father both testified that D.M. has a good relationship with Ciera\u2019s children. Ciera is unemployed; her driver\u2019s license is currently suspended; she used to have, but claims she no longer has, a substance-abuse problem (marijuana); and she denied intentionally harming herself in order to obtain pain medication. On her 21st birthday (September 2008), she was arrested for driving without a license and for drug abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-10\">{\u00b6 4} It is undisputed that as soon as the father started dating Ciera, the dynamics of his relationship with D.M. began to change. The father testified in May 2009 that he had been denied visitation with his son for over six months. The father explained that whenever he would call the mother to ask her if he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>could pick up D.M., the mother would tell him, \u201cNo, he doesn\u2019t want to go. I\u2019m not forcing my son to go with you.\u201d Initially, the father stopped driving to the mother\u2019s home to pick up D.M., as this would have been in vain. Eventually though, he started going to the mother\u2019s home with a police officer. Yet he was never able to pick up his son, because the mother would not allow it. As a result, each time, the father was reduced to visiting with his son for only a few minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">{\u00b6 5} The father testified that he once tried to leave the mother\u2019s home with D.M. when a police officer was present. The mother yelled and screamed, D.M. became very upset, and on the officer\u2019s advice, the father put his son down and left without him. The father also testified that he stopped calling his son in the evenings because even when his calls were answered, the father was not able to speak with his son.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">{\u00b6 6} The mother testified that until the fall of 2008, the father was a good father. However, in the fall of 2008, the father started to be less involved in D.M.\u2019s life. Between November 2008 and January 2009, the father did not see D.M. at all, as he did not call or come to her house. When the father tried again to exercise visitation in January 2009, D.M. would refuse to go with his father because he was afraid of him. The mother testified that she respected her son\u2019s wishes and that she did not force him to go with his father if he did not want to. The mother denied doing anything to prevent the father from having parenting time with D.M. and in fact stated that she wanted the father to have a relationship with D.M. The mother testified that after he started dating Ciera, the father\u2019s house changed (in that it now had cigarette butts and sex toys); however, D.M.\u2019s bedroom had not.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">{\u00b6 7} Thomas, the mother\u2019s boyfriend, testified that the relationship between the father and D.M. started to change after the father started dating Ciera. Thomas testified that when asked, D.M. states that he does not want to go with his father. Thomas denied that the father\u2019s visitation was obstructed by the mother. Rather, the mother is protecting her son, which includes telling the father that he will not be able to leave with D.M. if the child says he does not want to go. Thomas testified that he has a good relationship with D.M.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-8\">{\u00b6 8} The mother also testified that she was not willing to let D.M. go with the father because she had no means to contact the father. The mother testified that whenever she tried to call the father, he would either not answer her calls or would cuss at her. On the rare occasions when she could leave a voicemail, the father would not call her back. In November 2008, the mother placed 80 calls to the father one day, and 115 calls the next day. The mother admitted that she \u201cwould blow [the father\u2019s] phone up\u201d by calling him constantly so that they could talk about their son. The mother saw nothing wrong with calling the father constantly until he would either call back or \u201cdoes what\u2019s right by his son.\u201d The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>father explained that he does not return the mother\u2019s calls because he typically cannot get a word in as the mother screams and cusses at him. The father testified that the mother\u2019s incessant calling is harassing and has caused problems at his work.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">{\u00b6 9} The mother is bipolar, for which she takes medication. After D.M.\u2019s birth, she worked at Subway but was terminated for missing work. She is currently unemployed and is financially supported by Thomas. She has a criminal history that includes substance-abuse offenses both before and after the child\u2019s birth. Prior to D.M.\u2019s birth, the mother was convicted of operating a vehicle while under the influence (\u201cOVI\u201d) in 2002, was addicted to methamphetamine in 2001 or 2002 but no longer uses the drug thanks to treatment paid for by the father, and was convicted of attempted manufacturing of methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">{\u00b6 10} Since D.M.\u2019s birth in December 2004, the mother\u2019s criminal record includes an OVI conviction in 2007, a drug-abuse conviction in 2007 (marijuana possession), a theft conviction in 2007, and a probation violation in 2008 for testing positive for marijuana in August 2008. The mother denied having a marijuana problem and stated that her random drug screens after August 2008 have been negative. The mother and Thomas both have suspended driver\u2019s licenses and also have ignition-interlock devices in their cars. The mother also has restricted license plates.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">{\u00b6 11} Testimony was presented regarding Ciera\u2019s 21st birthday party, which took place at the father\u2019s house. Doris S., a friend of the mother, attended the party. She testified to observing several underage people consuming alcohol. She also observed the father and Ciera snort some orange powder and some white powder. After drinking two or three beers, Doris left the party and went to a bar. Although she was outraged by the activities taking place at the father\u2019s house, she did not call the police. D.M. was not at his father\u2019s house that day. The father testified that although there was alcohol at the party, there were no underage people and no drugs. The father denied snorting anything at the party. The father testified that he does not like drugs and that he spent a lot of money on the mother\u2019s substance-abuse treatment. The father testified that he had to ask Doris to leave the party, as she was intoxicated and causing a disturbance.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">{\u00b6 12} The father works full-time at King\u2019s Island, starting his days at 5 a.m. during the summer, and at 6 a.m. during the winter. He has no criminal history. D.M. has his own bedroom in the father\u2019s house. The father testified that he loves his son, has a good relationship with him, and wants to spend a lot of time with him. The father testified that if he had custody of D.M., his mother, who adores D.M., would help in the mornings if needed. Likewise, Ciera would help if needed.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>{\u00b6 13} The reason the shared-parenting plan was not followed by the parties was the father\u2019s work schedule. As a result, until September 2008, the father had parenting time during the evening once or twice weekly and occasionally on the weekends. The father testified that although D.M. could have stayed at his house overnight and be cared for by his paternal grandmother in the mornings, it never happened because the mother was adamantly opposed to D.M. being cared for by a paternal relative other than the father.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">{\u00b6 14} In November 2008, the mother moved to modify the shared-parenting plan. In March 2009, the father moved to terminate the shared-parenting plan and sought custody of D.M. The father also filed a contempt motion alleging that the mother had denied him parenting time on several occasions in March 2009. Following a hearing on the parties\u2019 motions in May 2009, the magistrate terminated the shared-parenting plan and granted custody of D.M. to the mother. The magistrate did not rule on the contempt motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">{\u00b6 15} The father filed objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision. He also filed a new contempt motion alleging that the mother had denied him parenting time on four occasions in July 2009. On October 28, 2009, the juvenile court found the father\u2019s objections to be well taken, appointed a guardian ad litem (\u201cGAL\u201d) for the child, and remanded the case to the magistrate. On November 16, 2009, the magistrate found the mother in contempt for denying the father parenting time on four occasions in July 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">{\u00b6 16} In 2010, the father filed his third contempt motion alleging that the mother had denied him parenting time on four occasions in January 2010. The GAL filed two reports. In her first report (filed in February 2010), the GAL noted that (1) the father was not receiving parenting time, because the child refused to go with his father; (2) the mother felt that the father should have no parenting time, because the child was afraid of his father; (3) the father felt that the mother had alienated his son from him; (4) the child attended therapy at Cincinnati\u2019s Children Hospital; and (5) according to the therapist, parenting-time could resume as long as there was a transition to the previous parenting-time schedule and that the mother was not a part of that transition. The GAL stated that it was in the best interest of the child to resume parenting time with the father immediately.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">{\u00b6 17} By temporary order signed by the parties, the juvenile court granted parenting time to the father on alternating weekends and overnight visitation on alternating Wednesdays, effective April 9, 2010. The father subsequently filed his fourth contempt motion, alleging that the mother had denied him parenting time on April 9, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-9\">{\u00b6 18} In her second report (filed in August 2010), the GAL stated that the father had been denied parenting time on at least four occasions between April 9 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>and July 4, 2010. \u201cFurther, several incidents have happened during the parenting time that have caused distress for [D.M.]. On one weekend, mother called [the child\u2019s] cell phone numerous times asking if he needed or wanted to come home. At some point, the child went down on the floor, covered his head with his hands and curl[ed] up into the fetal position. The father turned off the child\u2019s cell phone. The mother came to the father\u2019s home at 11:30 pm and brought the police. [D.M.] had to be awakened to talk with the police. The police have been sent to the father\u2019s house on other occasions during the child\u2019s visit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">{\u00b6 19} The GAL further stated that (1) to address the mother\u2019s concerns, the GAL asked the father and Ciera to take a drug test; both immediately complied with the request; the results were negative for both; (2) according to the mother, since the visits have resumed, D.M. is not sleeping well; and according to the therapist, the mother reports an increase in aggressive behavior and agitation for D.M.; and (3) the GAL\u2019s review of telephone conversations between the father and/or Ciera and the mother revealed the mother\u2019s disdain for the juvenile court\u2019s orders and her determination to interfere with the father\u2019s parenting time. In her recommendations, the GAL stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">{\u00b6 20} \u201c[I]t is in the best interest of [the child] to spend at least half of his time at Father\u2019s home. Further, if Mother continues to interfere with this parenting time, or continues to place [the child] in the middle of her conflicts, the Court should consider granting custody to Father. Mother\u2019s refusal to follow a Court Order raises concerns for her ability to provide for the best interest of her child. If Mother cannot control her behaviors, a psychological evaluation may be warranted. [T]ime is essential in this case. There is no doubt that the child is in distress. A resolution of the custody/parenting issues will be helpful in decreasing his anxiety.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">{\u00b6 21} On August 12, 2010, the juvenile court found the mother in contempt for denying the father parenting time on six occasions between January and July 2010. On October 13, 2010, the juvenile court terminated the shared-parenting plan, granted custody of the child to the mother and named her the residential parent, and granted the father parenting time. In addressing the best-interest factors under R.C. 3109.04, the juvenile court noted the mother\u2019s mental health and substance-abuse history, the mother\u2019s repeated unwillingness to cooperate with the father with regard to his relationship and parenting time with their son, the mother\u2019s unwillingness to cooperate with the court\u2019s orders, and the fact that the mother had denied the father parenting time.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">{\u00b622} The juvenile court also found, based on its August 2010 in camera review of the child (then five years old), that D.M. \u201cwas the most uncommunicative, anxious, and tense child that this Court has met under these circumstances. It is abundantly clear that the constant, and escalating, conflict between the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>parties has taken a tremendous toll on this young child. * * * [Further], the child is suffering stress and anxiety as a result of this pending proceeding.\u201d As a result of being found in contempt for denying the father parenting time, the mother was also sentenced by the juvenile court to 30 days in jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">{\u00b6 23} The father appeals, raising one assignment of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">{\u00b6 24} \u201cThe trial court erred in designating the mother residential parent and legal custodian of the minor child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">{\u00b6 25} A juvenile court\u2019s custody decision will not be reversed absent an abuse of discretion. <em>A.S. v. D.G., </em>Clinton App. No. CA2006-05-017, 2007-Ohio-1556, 2007 WL 959902, \u00b6 39. \u201cAbuse of discretion\u201d implies that the court\u2019s attitude was unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable. <em>Blakemore v. Blakemore </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 450 N.E.2d 1140. When applying the abuse-of-discretion standard, an appellate court\u2019s role is to ascertain whether the award of custody is supported by competent and credible evidence. <em>Davis v. Flickinger </em>(1997), 77 Ohio St.3d 415, 674 N.E.2d 1159. The discretion granted to a juvenile court in custody matters should be accorded the utmost respect, given the nature of the proceedings and the impact the court\u2019s determination will have on the lives of the parties concerned. <em>A.S. </em>at \u00b6 39.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-8\">{\u00b6 26} Because the father moved to terminate the shared-parenting plan, his motion was governed by R.C. 3109.04(E)(2)(c). <em>In re A.B., </em>Butler App. No. CA2009-10-257, 2010-Ohio-2823, 2010 WL 2488522. Under R.C. 3109.04(E)(2)(c), a juvenile court may terminate a shared-parenting plan if it determines that the plan is not in the best interest of the child. Upon terminating a shared-parenting plan, a juvenile court must then \u201cissue a modified decree for the allocation of parental rights and responsibilities\u201d in accordance with the best interest of the child, \u201cas if no decree for shared parenting had been granted and as if no request for shared parenting ever had been made.\u201d R.C. 3109.04(E)(2)(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-9\">{\u00b6 27} In determining the best interest of a child, a juvenile court is required to consider \u201call relevant factors\u201d found in R.C. 3109.04(F)(1) including (1) the wishes of the child\u2019s parents; (2) if the juvenile court has interviewed the child in chambers, the wishes and concerns of the child; (3) the child\u2019s relationship with the parents, siblings, and any other person who may significantly affect the child\u2019s best interest; (4) the child\u2019s adjustment to home, school, and community; (5) the mental and physical health of all parties; (6) the parent most likely to honor and facilitate court-approved parenting time, visitation, and companionship rights; (7) any failure of a parent to promptly pay a child-support payment, when required to do so by the courts, and (8) whether one of the parents has continuously and willfully denied the other parent\u2019s right to parenting time. R.C. 3109.04(F)(1)(a) through (i).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>{\u00b6 28} Upon a thorough review of the record, we find that the juvenile court abused its discretion in granting custody of D.M. to the mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">{\u00b6 29} We are mindful that the mother has been the primary caregiver of the child since he was born, as she emphasizes in her appellate brief. \u201cAlthough it is not a codified factor under R.C. 3109.04(F)(1), Ohio courts have held that a party\u2019s role as the primary caregiver is nevertheless a relevant factor when determining the best interest of a child. This factor is, however, not given presumptive weight over other relevant factors.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Terry L. v. Eva E., </em>Madison App. No. CA2006-05-019, 2007-Ohio-916, 2007 WL 646254, \u00b6 17. Further, after terminating a shared-parenting plan, custody of a child is to be determined as if making an initial custody determination. See <em>Kelly v. Kelly </em>(Mar. 8, 2002), Miami App. No. 2001-CA-52, 2002 WL 360656.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">{\u00b6 30} As the Second Appellate District stressed in <em>In re Custody of Harris, </em>168 Ohio App.3d 1, 2006-Ohio-3649, 857 N.E.2d 1235, \u201cchildren have certain rights, including \u2018the right to love each parent, without feeling guilt, pressure, or rejection; the right not to choose sides; the right to have a positive and constructive on-going relationship with each parent; and most important * * * the right to not participate in the painful games parents play to hurt each other or to be put in the middle of their battles.\u2019 \u201d Id. at \u00b6 11, quoting <em>Thomas v. Freeland </em>(Oct. 10, 1997), Greene App. No. 97-CA-06, 1997 WL 624331.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">{\u00b6 31} In the case at bar, both parents stand on an equal footing under several of the statutory factors in R.C. 3109.04(F)(1). The juvenile court found that (1) both parents want custody of their son, (2) D.M. has a deep emotional attachment to both parents and has a positive relationship with both Thomas and Ciera, the parents\u2019 respective significant others, and (3) D.M. is seemingly well adjusted in either parent\u2019s home and is involved in age-appropriate school and extracurricular activities. R.C. 3109.04(F)(1)(a), (c), and (d). The juvenile court also found that the factors under R.C. 3109.04(F)(1)(g), (h), and (j) were not applicable. The record supports the court\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-8\">{\u00b6 32} In addressing the best-interest factors under R.C. 3109.04, the juvenile court also noted the mother\u2019s mental-health and substance-abuse history, the mother\u2019s repeated unwillingness to cooperate with the father with regard to his relationship and parenting time with their son, the mother\u2019s unwillingness to cooperate with the court\u2019s orders, and the fact that the mother had denied the father parenting time. R.C. 3109.04(F)(1)(e), (f), and (i). Despite these findings, amply supported by the record, the juvenile court granted custody of D.M. to the mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-9\">{\u00b6 33} In <em>Flickinger, </em>77 Ohio St.3d 415, 674 N.E.2d 1159, the Ohio Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b95-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>{\u00b6 34} \u201cIn today\u2019s society that fully admits the need for parenting by both parents, each parent should have full involvement in a child\u2019s life, where possible and desired by the parent. When one parent begins to cut out another parent, especially one that has been fully involved in that child\u2019s life, the best interest of the child <em>is </em>materially affected. * * * Clearly, preventing a child from spending time with a caring and loving parent, as well as the hostility and friction generated by the disputes that arise over such issues, may be considered harmful to the best interest of the child.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) Id. at 419-420.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">{\u00b6 35} We find that it was arbitrary for the juvenile court to grant custody of D.M. to the mother, a parent (1) who has repeatedly denied the father his parenting time, (2) who was twice found in contempt by the juvenile court for denying the father\u2019s parenting time on ten occasions in the span of a year (July 2009 to July 2010), (3) who is determined to interfere with the father\u2019s parenting time as noted by the GAL in her second report, (4) who has in fact interfered with the father\u2019s parenting time and whose interference has caused great distress to the child, as reported by the GAL in her second report, and (5) who, in the juvenile court\u2019s own words, \u201chas demonstrated repeatedly her unwillingness to not only cooperate with the father concerning his relationship and parenting time with the child, but her unwillingness to cooperate with this Court\u2019s Orders.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">{\u00b6 36} While the juvenile court properly terminated the shared-parenting plan, we hold that the court erred in granting custody of D.M. to the mother. The father\u2019s assignment of error is well taken and sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">{\u00b6 37} The judgment is reversed, and the cause is remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-8\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b95-9\">Powell, P.J., and Hendrickson, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
