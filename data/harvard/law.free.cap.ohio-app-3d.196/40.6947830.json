Celebrezze, Jr., Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b79-15\">{\u00b6 1} Appellant, Cynthia Hoge (now known as Cynthia Gordon), brings the instant appeal challenging the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of appellee, CitiMortgage, Inc., in a foreclosure action. After a thorough review of the record and law, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-16\">{\u00b6 2} Appellant sought to refinance her home mortgage in 2005. She found what she thought was favorable financing through American Equity Mortgage (\u201cAEM\u201d). On January 9, 2006, she executed a note and mortgage to AEM in the amount of $85,500. Later, this note and mortgage were assigned to CitiFinaneial Mortgage Company, Inc., and assigned again to its successor by merger, Citi-Mortgage. Appellant alleges that AEM represented to her that her monthly payment would be $680 per month, but failed to inform her that this did not include real estate taxes and insurance, which brought the monthly payment to $872. She also alleges that AEM did not provide her with loan documents at least three days before closing.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>{\u00b6 3} Prior to December 27, 2007, CitiMortgage alleged that appellant became delinquent on her payments, and on that date, it filed a complaint in foreclosure. Appellant sought four extensions of time to research the loan documents, find an attorney, and draft a response and counterclaims before filing an answer. Finally, on September 2, 2008, appellant filed an answer and counterclaim, which the trial court accepted. Appellant asserted claims of fraud and misrepresentation, violations of the Truth in Lending Act (\u201cTILA\u201d) and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (\u201cRESPA\u201d), and intentional infliction of emotional distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">{\u00b6 4} CitiMortgage moved for summary judgment on February 2, 2009, and appellant twice moved for an extension of time before filing a motion to dismiss the complaint. In this motion, appellant alleged that CitiMortgage did not have standing to bring its action. A hearing was held regarding this motion, and on March 26, 2010, the magistrate found that CitiMortgage had standing and overruled appellant\u2019s motion. On that same date, the magistrate also granted CitiMortgage\u2019s motion for summary judgment even though appellant had not filed a response. After various procedural irregularities resulted in a prior dismissed appeal and adoption of the magistrate\u2019s decision by the trial court, appellant perfected the instant appeal, assigning two errors for our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">Law and Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">Period of Time to Respond to Summary Judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b80-8\">{\u00b6 5} Appellant first argues that \u201c[t]he trial court erred to the prejudice of the appellant and abused its discretion by denying appellant the opportunity to respond to the merits of appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b80-9\">{\u00b6 6} The Rules of Civil Procedure provide a means to terminate clearly unmeritorious litigation at an early stage through summary judgment. Civ.R. 56. According to Civ.R. 56(C), a summary-judgment motion \u201cshall be served at least fourteen days before the time fixed for hearing. The adverse party, prior to the day of hearing, may serve and file opposing affidavits. Summary judgment shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, written admissions, affidavits, transcripts of evidence, and written stipulations of fact, if any, <em>timely filed in the action, </em>show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Loc.R. 11(1) of this jurisdiction gives a party 30 days within which to file a motion opposing summary judgment and makes judgment upon the pleadings the default method of hearing unless otherwise stated by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>{\u00b6 7} Appellant argues that she was denied an opportunity to respond to CitiMortgage\u2019s summary-judgment motion. However, over a year passed between the time the motion was filed and the magistrate\u2019s ruling. Appellant asserts that she asked the trial court to extend the time for filing her response until after a ruling on the motion to dismiss, but nothing in the record demonstrates that appellant was prevented from filing her response. The trial court never ruled on appellant\u2019s motions to expand the time in which to respond, and \u201c[wjhen a trial court fails to rule on a motion, the motion is considered denied.\u201d <em>State v. Pate, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 95382, 2011-Ohio-1692, 2011 WL 1326357, \u00b6 33, citing <em>Solon v. Solon Baptist Temple, Inc. </em>(1982), 8 Ohio App.3d 347, 351-352, 457 N.E.2d 858; <em>Georgeoff v. O\u2019Brien </em>(1995), 105 Ohio App.3d 373, 378, 663 N.E.2d 1348.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">{\u00b6 8} The trial court did not deprive appellant of an opportunity to oppose summary judgment, and the case law she points to is not applicable to her case. In those cases,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the trial courts ruled on motions for summary judgment before the period set by the applicable civil rule, by local rule, or by the court had expired. In each case, the reviewing court reversed that determination to give the parties an opportunity to respond.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">{\u00b6 9} Although appellant requested a 30-day extension from the time the trial court ruled on her motion to dismiss to file a response, that motion was impliedly denied when the court had not ruled on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">{\u00b6 10} In some cases, where additional discovery is required to adequately respond to a summary-judgment motion, the trial court should allow more time so this discovery can be completed. <em>Tucker v. Webb Corp. </em>(1983), 4 Ohio St.3d 121, 447 N.E.2d 100. However, appellant\u2019s motion set forth no such need. The February 9, 2010 motion for an extension asserted only that the additional time was required because her attorney was busy. The final request for an extension of time did not include any reason why an additional 30 days from the time the court ruled on appellant\u2019s motion to dismiss was necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">{\u00b6 11} This court has previously held that \u201c[i]f a party opposing a motion for summary judgment cannot present by affidavit facts which are sufficient to justify his opposition he may seek a continuance or deferral of the court\u2019s action on the motion by filing affidavits which must state sufficient reasons why he cannot then present by affidavit facts essential to justify his opposition to the motion and why or how the continuance, deferral of action, or discovery would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>permit him to obtain such facts.\u201d <em>Gates Mills Inv. Co. v. Pepper Pike </em>(1978), 59 Ohio App.2d 155, 392 N.E.2d 1316, paragraph two of the syllabus. A motion pursuant to Civ.R. 56(F) must set forth the reasons justifying delay. Appellant\u2019s motions failed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">{\u00b6 12} Appellant.also failed to request that the trial court rule on her motions for extension of time or her motion to dismiss. While CitiMortgage did twice request such action, appellant sat by and waited for a year while nothing happened in the case. All that is required to preserve appellant\u2019s due process rights is sufficient notice of the filing of the motion for summary judgment and sufficient opportunity to prepare a response. <em>Brown v. Akron Beacon Journal Publishing Co. </em>(1991), 81 Ohio App.3d 135, 139, 610 N.E.2d 507, citing Civ.R. 56(C). According to CitiMortgage\u2019s calculation, appellant had 414 days to respond. This is a sufficient time under Civ.R. 56(C) when appellant advanced no extenuating circumstances justifying the failure to respond in that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">{\u00b6 13} Appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">Grant of Summary Judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b82-8\">{\u00b6 14} The fact that no response was filed should not automatically lead to the granting of CitiMortgage\u2019s motion. <em>Rose v. Natl. Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1999), 134 Ohio App.3d 229, 730 N.E.2d 1014. CitiMortgage still has the burden of showing that no genuine issue of material fact exists, and it must carry that burden whether or not a response is filed. Id. See also <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett </em>(1986), 477 U.S. 317, 330, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265; <em>Mitseff v. Wheeler </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 112, 115, 526 N.E.2d 798. This is the foundation of appellant\u2019s second assignment of error, in which she argues that \u201c[t]he trial court erred to the prejudice of the appellant and abused its discretion by granting appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment where, pursuant to Civ.R. 56(C), there are clearly genuine issues of material facts and the appellee is not entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b82-9\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cCiv.R. 56(C) specifically provides that before summary judgment may be granted, it must be determined that: (1) No genuine issue as to any material fact remains to be litigated; (2) the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law; and (3) it appears from the evidence that reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion, and viewing such evidence most strongly in favor of the party against whom the motion for summary judgment is made, that conclusion is adverse to that party.\u201d <em>Temple v. Wean United, Inc. </em>(1977), 50 Ohio St.2d 317, 327, 364 N.E.2d 267.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-10\">{\u00b6 16} Although appellant argues that the portion of CitiMortgage\u2019s brief justifying summary judgment based on appellant\u2019s answer and counterclaim is irrelevant, this court reviews the lower court\u2019s granting of summary judgment de <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>novo. <em>Brown v. Scioto Cty. Bd. of Commrs. </em>(1998), 87 Ohio App.3d 704, 622 N.E.2d 1153. An appellate court reviewing the grant of summary judgment must follow the standards set forth in Civ.R. 56(C). \u201c[T]he reviewing court evaluates the record * * * in a light most favorable to the nonmoving party. * * * [T]he motion must be overruled if reasonable minds could find for the party opposing the motion.\u201d <em>Saunders v. McFaul </em>(1990), 71 Ohio App.3d 46, 50, 593 N.E.2d 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">a. The Foreclosure Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">{\u00b6 17} In CitiMortgage\u2019s motion for summary judgment, it argued that appellant was delinquent on her mortgage, that it notified her pursuant to the instrument that it was accelerating her payments so the entire outstanding balance was due, and that no payment was forthcoming. It also established that it was the holder and owner of the note and mortgage and that the outstanding balance was $84,369.83. \u201cIt is well settled that a mortgagee is entitled to judgment after there has been a default on the conditions of the mortgage and the debt as evidenced by the note having been accelerated.\u201d <em>Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. v. Sessley, </em>188 Ohio App.3d 213, 2010-Ohio-2902, 935 N.E.2d 70, \u00b6 20, citing <em>Bank One, N.A. v. Swartz, </em>Lorain App. No. 03CA008308, 2004-Ohio-1986, 2004 WL 840118, \u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">{\u00b6 18} As a defense, appellant alleged that AEM had committed fraud during the origination of the note and mortgage. CitiMortgage claims that it was not the loan originator and did not participate in the original transaction. However, \u201cthe assignee of a contract takes that contract with all rights of the assignor and subject to all defenses that the obligor may have had against the assignor.\u201d <em>Citizens Fed. Bank, F.S.B. v. Brickler </em>(1996), 114 Ohio App.3d 401, 410, 683 N.E.2d 358.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-8\">{\u00b6 19} \u201cThe default rule for consumer and commercial mortgages alike is that a mortgage lender\u2019s assignee takes subject to the claims and defenses that the borrower might assert against the original lender.\u201d Peterson, Predatory Structured Financing, 28 CDZLR 2185, 2233, citing 4; Corbin on Contracts (1996) 892, 892A; 3 Williston on Contracts (1960) 432; Farnsworth on Contracts (2d Ed.1990) 11.8. This is subject to two limitations embodied in the ability to draft waiver-of-defense clauses in contracts and the \u201cholder in due course\u201d rule.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>Id. A holder in due course takes free of certain claims and defenses that a party may assert against the originator of the mortgage. <em>Countrywide Home Loans Servicing, L.L.P. v. Heck, </em>Ottawa App. No. OT-10-011, 2011-Ohio-147, 2011 WL 281148, \u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">{\u00b6 20} R.C. 1303.35(A)(1)(c) provides that fraud is still a valid defense even against a holder in due course.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In asserting her fraud defense, appellant alleged that AEM did not include the payment of taxes and insurance in the stated monthly payment and that CitiMortgage was liable for this fraud and misrepresentation through 16 C.F.R. 433.2(a). CitiMortgage correctly pointed out that this regulation does not apply to real estate transactions. After CitiMortgage demonstrated that it was entitled to judgment, appellant had a burden to produce evidence that a genuine issue of material fact existed to preclude summary judgment, and, based on the documents and pleadings before the court, appellant failed to do this. CitiMortgage was entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law on its foreclosure claim based on the record before the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">b. The Counterclaims</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">{\u00b6 21} Regarding appellant\u2019s counterclaim, CitiMortgage demonstrated in its motion for summary judgment that it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Appellant\u2019s first claim was for fraud and misrepresentation that allegedly occurred during the loan origination.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-8\">{\u00b6 22} \u201cA claim for common-law fraud requires proof of the following elements: (1) a representation or, where there is a duty to disclose, concealment of a fact, (2) which is material to the transaction at hand, (3) made falsely, with knowledge of its falsity, or with such utter disregard and recklessness as to whether it is true or false that knowledge may be inferred, (4) with the intent of misleading another into relying upon it, (5) justifiable reliance upon the representation or concealment, and (6) a resulting injury proximately caused by the reliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-9\">{\u00b6 23} \u201c \u2018Failure to specifically plead the operative facts constituting an alleged fraud presents a defective claim * * *. The \u201cparticularity\u201d requirement of Civ.R. 9(B) means that the pleading must contain allegations of fact which tend to show each and every element of a cause of action for fraud.\u2019 <em>Rieger v. Podeweltz, </em>Montgomery App. No. 23520, 2010-Ohio-2509, 2010 WL 2225398, \u00b6 9.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Sutton Funding, L.L.C. v. Herres, </em>188 Ohio App.3d 686, 2010-Ohio-3645, 936 N.E.2d 574, \u00b6 49-50.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>{\u00b624} Appellant failed to support her claim for fraud with specific facts. Therefore, the trial court could properly grant CitiMortgage summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\">{\u00b6 25} With respect to the federal claims, TILA actions carry a one-year statute of limitations. 15 U.S.C. 1640(e) (TILA actions must be brought \u201cwithin one year from the date of the occurrence of the violation.\u201d). RESPA has one- to three-year limitations periods depending on the specific violation. 12 U.S.C. 2614. Actions based on violations of 12 U.S.C. 2607 (kickbacks and unearned fees) and 2608 (seller requiring title insurance from a specific title company) must be brought within one year, while violations of 12 U.S.C. 2605 (servicing of mortgage loans and administration of escrow accounts) must be brought within three years. Since the alleged violations occurred on or about January 2006, appellant\u2019s TILA and RESPA claims could be barred by the applicable statutes of limitation. However, when asserted as a defense or claim for recoupment,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> according to <em>Beach v. Ocwen Fed. Bank </em>(1998), 528 U.S. 410, 118 S.Ct. 1408, 140 L.Ed.2d 566, TILA claims may be raised regardless of the one-year statute of limitations. \u201cPrior to <em>Beach, </em>Ohio courts similarly held that a TILA counterclaim arising out of the same transaction as the claim (the loan agreement) was not barred by the one year statute of limitations since it was a recoupment.\u201d <em>Residential Funding Co., L.L.C. v. Thorne, </em>Lucas App. No. L-09-1324, 2010-Ohio-4271, 2010 WL 3516785, \u00b6 39. Appellant never argued that this was a recoupment claim or defense or that the TILA claim was not time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">{\u00b6 26} Even if the claims were timely brought, this does not create a genuine issue of fact because appellant points only to 16 C.F.R. 433.2 as imposing liability on CitiMortgage, an assignee. This regulation deals only with the \u201csale or lease of goods or services to consumers.\u201d The sale and financing of real property is not covered. Therefore, appellant has not demonstrated that CitiMortgage is liable for alleged TILA or RESPA violations committed by the loan originator.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">{\u00b6 27} Congress specifically limited assignee liability in TILA. 15 U.S.C. 1641(a) states: \u201c[A]ny civil action for a violation of this subchapter or proceeding under Section 1607 of this title which may be brought against a creditor may be maintained against any assignee of such creditor only if the violation for which such action or proceeding is brought is apparent on the face of the disclosure statement, except where the assignment was involuntary.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See also Kelley, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>Assignee Liability: Through the Minefield (2007), 61 CONFLQR 279, 280. Appellant has failed to argue that the alleged violations were clear on the face of the instruments necessary to impose liability under TILA, how the statutory provisions of RE SPA and TILA were violated, and how they apply to CitiMort-gage.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">{\u00b6 28} Appellant also asserted a claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress. \u201cThe Ohio Supreme Court has declared that, absent contemporaneous physical injury, compensable emotional distress must be severe and disabling.\u201d Knief <em>v. Minnich </em>(1995), 103 Ohio App.3d 103, 108, 658 N.E.2d 1072, citing <em>Paugh v. Hanks </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St.3d 72, 451 N.E.2d 759, paragraph three of the syllabus. Cases following <em>Paugh </em>have required a plaintiff to \u201cpresent some guarantee of genuineness in support of their claim, such as expert evidence, to prevent a court from granting summary judgment in favor of the defendant.\u201d <em>Knief </em>at 108, 658 N.E.2d 1072, citing <em>Grote v. J.S. Mayer &amp; Co. </em>(1990), 59 Ohio App.3d 44, 48, 570 N.E.2d 1146. Here, appellant has not offered any \u201cguarantee of genuineness\u201d that she has, in fact, suffered debilitating emotional distress of the type compensable in Ohio. See <em>Hayes v. Heintz, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 79335, 2002-Ohio-2608, 2002 WL 1041370.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">{\u00b6 29} Therefore, the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment to CitiMortgage on appellant\u2019s counterclaims. Appellant\u2019s second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b86-8\">Stewart, P.J., and Rocco, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b81-9\">. <em>Roben Tire Co. v.
