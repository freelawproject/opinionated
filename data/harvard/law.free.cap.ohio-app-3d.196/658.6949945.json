By way of summary judgment, the trial court found that Continental (the successor by merger with Buckeye) had a duty to defend Ozvath in the collection action, but did not have to indemnify Ozvath for the amount he paid in a settlement with Harbin. After a hearing, the court ordered Continental to pay some, but not all, of the attorney fees and prejudgment interest that Ozvath sought from Continental.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-10\">{\u00b6 2} Continental appeals, claiming that the trial court erred in determining that the insurance company had a duty to defend Ozvath and in granting attorney fees to Ozvath. Ozvath cross-appeals, claiming that the trial court should have ordered Continental to indemnify Ozvath for the amount of the collection-action settlement and that it erred in reducing the amount of claimed attorney fees and prejudgment interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-11\">{\u00b6 3} For the following reasons, the trial court\u2019s judgment in favor of Ozvath is reversed, and the case is remanded for the trial court to enter judgment in favor of Continental.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">{\u00b6 4} In 1994, Robert Harbin, an employee of Ohi-Tec Manufacturing, Inc., was injured at work by a 150-ton mechanical press, resulting in the amputation of two fingers and the loss of use of another finger. Harbin sued Ohi-Tec in the Clark County Common Pleas Court for his personal injuries, and he alleged intentional tort, negligence, and punitive damages; he also claimed that the employment-intentional-tort statute (R.C. 2745.01) was unconstitutional. Buckeye defended Ohi-Tec under a reservation of rights pursuant to an insurance policy issued to Ohi-Tec (and of which Charles Ozvath was a named insured). Buckeye informed Ohi-Tec that while the policy excluded claims based on intentional acts, the policy would \u201cprovide indemnity for any damages which would be awarded as a result of the negligence claims made in Count 2.\u201d Ozvath was not named as a defendant in the personal-injury action.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">{\u00b6 5} After a jury trial, a jury awarded Harbin $750,000 in compensatory damages on his employer-intentional-tort claim and $300,000 in punitive damages. Ohi-Tec moved for judgment notwithstanding the verdict (\u201cJNOV\u201d), which the trial court granted; the trial court also stated in its decision that if the appellate court reversed the judgment of the trial court on the JNOV, the trial court provisionally granted Ohi-Tec\u2019s motion for a new trial. On June 14, 2002, we reversed the trial court and ordered it to enter judgment in favor of Harbin, as found by the jury. <em>Harbin v. Ohi-Tec Mfg., Inc., </em>Clark App. No. 2001 CA 70, 2002-Ohio-2923, 2002 WL 1332471. The parties represent that Harbin sought to collect the judgment from Buckeye, but he was unsuccessful.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">{\u00b6 6} In August 2002, Harbin brought suit (\u201cthe collection action\u201d) in the Montgomery County Common Pleas Court against Charles Ozvath, his wife, and his three sons (all of whom were allegedly owners of Ohi-Tec) and Ohi-Tec. Harbin stated in his complaint that Ohi-Tec had failed to satisfy the employer-intentional-tort judgment, and through various claims of fraud, Harbin sought to pierce Ohi-Tec\u2019s corporate veil. Stated generally, Harbin alleged that Ozvath had fraudulently transferred the assets of Ohio Pressed Steel (an alleged predecessor company of Ohi-Tec) to himself (Ozvath), created Ohi-Tec, and then fraudulently transferred shares of Ohi-Tec to his sons.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">{\u00b6 7} In early 2003, Ohi-Tec filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code, and the collection action was stayed. Ohi-Tec also removed the collection action to federal district court. In March 2005, the federal district court remanded the collection action to the Montgomery County <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>Common Pleas Court, and the bankruptcy court granted Harbin derivative standing to pursue the collection action against the Ozvaths in the common pleas court. The bankruptcy stay was lifted in April 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">{\u00b6 8} In January 2006, Harbin filed a second amended complaint in the collection action, which indicated that he was pursuing the case against the Ozvaths with derivative standing for the bankruptcy estate of Ohi-Tec. In March 2006, Ozvath filed a notice of claim with Buckeye seeking to have Buckeye defend him against Harbin\u2019s collection action and to indemnify him against any damages. On May 23, 2006, Buckeye notified Ozvath that it was denying coverage because the complaint alleged intentional acts, it did not allege an \u201coccurrence\u201d as defined by the policy, and punitive damages are not covered as a matter of public policy. Harbin filed a third amended complaint in the collection action in June 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">{\u00b6 9} In August 2006, Ozvath initiated this action against Buckeye, seeking a declaratory judgment and damages for breach of contract. Ozvath requested that the trial court \u201cdeclare that Buckeye is obligated to provide coverage under the Policy to Mr. Ozvath for the Montgomery County Collection Case, including reimbursement of defense fees and costs, payment of future defense fees and costs and indemnification for any judgment (however unlikely) against Mr. Ozvath.\u201d Ozvath also sought damages for the attorney fees and costs that he had expended in defending himself in the collection action.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">{\u00b6 10} The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment on Buckeye\u2019s (now Continental\u2019s) alleged duty to defend and to indemnify Ozvath in the collection action. The trial court concluded that Continental had a duty to defend Ozvath in the collection action, but did not have a duty to indemnify Ozvath. (While motions in the declaratory-judgment/breach-of-eontract case were pending in the trial court, the collection action settled for $315,000.) The court subsequently held hearings on the amount of attorney fees and prejudgment interest that Continental owed to Ozvath. After a hearing, the court awarded attorney fees and prejudgment interest to Ozvath, although in an amount less than what Ozvath had requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-8\">{\u00b6 11} Continental appeals from the trial court\u2019s rulings. Ozvath has cross-appealed. We find Continental\u2019s first assignment of error to be dispositive.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b697-10\">{\u00b6 12} Continental\u2019s first assignment of error states:</p>\n<p id=\"b697-11\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cThe trial court erred when it determined that appellant [Continental] had a duty to provide a defense to Charles Ozvath in certain underlying litigation under the terms of the subject insurance policy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b698-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>{\u00b6 14} In its first assignment of error, Continental claims that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to Ozvath on his claim that Continental had a duty to defend him in the collection action.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cThe purpose of a motion for summary judgment is to test whether genuine issues of material fact exist such that a trial is necessary to resolve those issues.\u201d <em>Abroms v. Synergy Bldg. Sys., </em>Montgomery App. No. 23944, 2011-Ohio-2180, 2011 WL 1734081, \u00b6 34. Summary judgment should be granted only if no genuine issue of material fact exists, the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion, which is adverse to the nonmoving party. Civ.R. 56; <em>Harless v. Willis Day Warehousing Co. </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 64, 66, 375 N.E.2d 46.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">{\u00b6 16} Upon a motion for summary judgment, the moving party bears the initial burden of showing that no genuine issue of material fact exists for trial. <em>Dresher v. Burt </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 280, 292-293, 662 N.E.2d 264. Once the moving party satisfies its burden, the nonmoving party may not rest upon the mere allegations or denials of the party\u2019s pleadings. Id.; Civ.R. 56(E). Rather, the burden then shifts to the nonmoving party to respond, with affidavits or as otherwise permitted by Civ.R. 56, setting forth specific facts that show that there is a genuine issue of material fact for trial. Id. Throughout, the evidence must be construed in favor of the nonmoving party. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">{\u00b6 17} An appellate court reviews summary judgments de novo, meaning that we review such judgments independently and without deference to the trial court\u2019s determinations. <em>Koos v. Cent. Ohio Cellular, Inc. </em>(1994), 94 Ohio App.3d 579, 588, 641 N.E.2d 265.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cAn insurance policy is a contract between the insurer and the insured. If we must interpret a provision in the policy, we look to the policy language and rely on the plain and ordinary meaning of the words used to ascertain the intent of the parties to the contract. We examine the contract as a whole, which means that an endorsement is read as though it is within the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-8\">{\u00b6 19} \u201c * * * [T]he duty to defend is broader than and distinct from the duty to indemnify. The duty to defend is determined by the scope of the allegations in the complaint. If the allegations state a claim that potentially or arguably falls within the liability insurance coverage, then the insurer must defend the insured in the action. But if all the claims are clearly and indisputably outside the contracted coverage, the insurer need not defend the insured.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Ward v. United Foundries, Inc., </em>129 Ohio St.3d 292, 2011-Ohio-3176, 951 N.E.2d 770, \u00b6 18-19.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-9\">{\u00b6 20} It is undisputed that Ozvath is a named insured on the Comprehensive Business Policy issued by Buckeye to Ohi-Tec for the period of June 14, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>1994, to July 14, 1995.

Occurs in the \u2018coverage territory.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b700-19\">{\u00b6 54} In seeking summary judgment in the declaratory-judgment/breach-of-contract case on its duty to defend Ozvath in Harbin\u2019s collection action, Continental focused on the allegations in Harbin\u2019s complaint against Ozvath in the collection action. Continental argued that \u201call such allegations contained in the Complaint are based on intentional acts committed by Mr. Ozvath, which would serve to pierce the corporate veil and hold him personally liable for any judgments rendered against Ohi-Tec. Consequently, as this Complaint is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>alleging an occurrence that is covered under the Buckeye Union policy, a duty to defend or indemnify would not arise.\u201d Continental further argued:</p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\">{\u00b6 55} \u201cIndeed, even if that coverage should be provided to Mr. Ozvath as the Montgomery County Collections Case stems from the Clark County Personal Injury Lawsuit, Buckeye still does not have a duty to defend or indemnify as a jury has already adjudicated that the injury sustained by Mr. Harbin was an intentional tort substantially certain to occur from the standpoint of the insured, Ohi-Tec. Consequently, the allegations contained in the Montgomery County Collections Complaint allege that Mr. Ozvath should stand in the shoes of Ohi-Tec as he served as the \u2018alter-ego\u2019 of the corporation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">{\u00b6 56} In response, Ozvath argued that there was \u201ca substantial and direct connection between the Personal Injury Litigation and the Collection Litigation. * * * [0]nly one loss occurred with respect to Mr. Harbin \u2014 the damages caused by his bodily injury. The alleged wrongful acts of Chuck Ozvath * * * did not cause a separate injury or loss. Instead, in the Collection Litigation, Mr. Harbin alleges that Chuck Ozvath committed wrongful acts in an attempt to avoid paying for the loss \u2014 the judgment in the Personal Injury Litigation. Thus, * * * the Personal Injury Litigation judgment and the fraudulent transfers alleged in the Collection Litigation are intertwined, directly connected and not remote from each other.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">{\u00b6 57} Focusing on the personal-injury action, Ozvath further argued that the injury to Harbin constituted an \u201coccurrence\u201d within the meaning of the insurance policy and that \u201cthere is nothing in the Personal Injury Litigation that suggests that Mr. Harbin\u2019s injuries were anything but an accident from Chuck Ozvath\u2019s perspective.\u201d Ozvath asserted that because he was not a party to the personal-injury action, imputing the jury\u2019s determination that Ohi-Tec had committed an intentional tort to him would violate due process. In short, Ozvath argued that there was \u201cno break in causation and there [was] no intervening cause relieving [Continental] of its obligation to defend Chuck Ozvath.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">{\u00b6 58} In concluding that Continental had a duty to defend Ozvath in the action, the trial court adopted Ozvath\u2019s reasoning. It stated that the collection action would not exist without the injury to Harbin and that the claims raised in the collection action were \u201cinsufficient on their own to sustain a cause of action.\u201d The trial court considered the allegations in both the personal-injury and collection actions and found that Harbin\u2019s injury was a \u201cbodily injury\u201d that constituted an \u201coccurrence\u201d under the policy. The court determined that Section I.A.2.a of the General Liability Coverage Part did not apply, because \u201cto hold an individual not a party to [the] jury trial as having intended the injury is a leap of logic and deprivation of due process rights that this Court will not make.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>{\u00b6 59} The trial court further concluded that the stopgap endorsement did not relieve Continental of its obligation to defendant Ozvath in the collection action. The trial court found that Ozvath was not an insured under the stopgap form, because that endorsement applied to employers, and Ohi-Tec \u2014 not Ozvath \u2014 was Harbin\u2019s employer. The court reiterated that there had been no showing that Ozvath intended the injury to Harbin.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">{\u00b6 60} As stated above, whether Continental had a duty to defend Ozvath in the collection action depends upon whether the allegations in the collection action\u2019s complaint state a claim that potentially or arguably falls within the liability-insurance coverage. Ozvath argues that to decide this issue, we must view the allegations in the collection action in light of the personal-injury action, in accordance with <em>Danis v. Great Am. Ins. Co., </em>159 Ohio App.3d 119, 2004-Ohio-6222, 823 N.E.2d 59.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">{\u00b6 61} In <em>Danis, </em>a predecessor of Waste Management of Ohio had purchased certain companies from Danis Industries Corporation, including a subsidiary that managed a landfill known as Valleycrest. Many years after the sale, Waste Management was informed that it was a potentially responsible party under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (\u201cCERCLA\u201d), and it demanded indemnification from Danis for response costs. The parties settled the claim with Danis\u2019s agreement to indemnify Waste Management for \u201ccovered claims,\u201d which included claims related to pollution. Shortly before executing the settlement, Danis underwent a major corporate restructuring, referred to by the parties as a \u201crecapitalization/split-off.\u201d According to later allegations, the split was designed to insulate a profitable subsidiary of Danis from existing and future environmental liabilities to Waste Management.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">{\u00b6 62} When Waste Management later sought indemnification from Danis on a new claim relating to toxic exposure at Valleycrest, Danis informed Waste Management that it lacked the resources to satisfy its obligations for both the CERCLA costs and the new claim. Waste Management filed a federal complaint against Danis and various officers of the company, alleging wrongful business conduct concerning the earlier settlement and restructuring. Danis and its officers sought coverage and a defense from its insurer, Great American. After Great American denied coverage and refused to advance costs for the lawsuit, Danis and the individuals filed a complaint in state court for breach of contract and declaratory judgment. The trial court found in favor of the Danis plaintiffs (i.e., that Great American did have a duty to defend), finding that the claims by Waste Management were not brought because of any pollution, but because of Danis\u2019s independent and intervening acts of allegedly wrongful business transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>{\u00b6 63} On appeal, we reversed. Initially, we reviewed Danis\u2019s policy with Great American (which covered all the Danis plaintiffs). The policy was basically a directors and officers insurance policy, which covered the wrongful-business claims, but excluded claims \u201c \u2018based upon, arising out of, [or] relating to * * * seepage, pollution, radiation, emission, or contamination of any kind.\u2019 \u201d Turning to the allegations in the complaint, we stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">{\u00b6 64} \u201cIn the present case, only one loss occurred, and that is the damage caused by the polluted site. The acts of the Danis companies and their directors and officers, whether preliminary, concurrent, or subsequent, did not cause a separate injury or loss; instead, the alleged wrongful acts were an attempt to avoid paying for the loss. This is not the typical situation in which one party commits a tort, and the negligent or wrongful act of another party operates to cause either sharing or a complete release of liability for the injury. To the contrary, the same parties (the Danis companies and their affiliates) are allegedly responsible for the entire loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">{\u00b6 65} \u201cFor a party to be relieved of liability, \u2018a break in the chain of causation must take place. A break will occur when there intervenes between an agency creating a hazard and an injury resulting therefrom another conscious and responsible agency which could or should have eliminated the hazard. However, the intervening cause must be disconnected from the negligence of the first person and must be of itself an efficient, independent, and self-producing cause of the injury.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">{\u00b6 66} \u201cTo be an intervening cause, \u2018 \u201cthe second negligent act must be both \u2018independent\u2019 and \u2018new.\u2019 In the context of this analysis, the second act is \u2018independent\u2019 from the original act if it was not brought into operation by the original act; <em>i.e., </em>the second act must not have occurred as a result of the first. To be considered \u2018new,\u2019 the second act must not have been reasonably foreseeable when the original act occurred.\u201d \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b703-8\">{\u00b6 67} \u201cApplying the above concepts to the present case, we find that the claims involved in the federal [business tort] case are not independent of the original pollution settlements. Instead, the underlying settlements are part of the necessary predicate for liability of the Danis defendants in the federal case. The original pollution settlements and the alleged illegal transfers are intertwined, are directly connected, and are not remote from each other.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Danis, </em>159 Ohio App.3d 119, 2004-Ohio-6222, 823 N.E.2d 59, at \u00b6 54-57. We thus concluded that the pollution exclusion in the Great American policy applied to the federal business tort action and that the trial court had erred in granting summary judgment to the Danis plaintiffs on Great American\u2019s duty to advance costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>{\u00b6 68} In the present case (and unlike in Danis), the allegations of wrongful business practices are not covered by the Buckeye policy. Rather, the Buckeye policy provides coverage to Ozvath (and Ohi-Tec) only for \u201cbodily injury\u201d or \u201cproperty damage.\u201d Whereas Great American looked to the prior events to apply an exclusion in <em>Danis, </em>Ozvath looks to Harbin\u2019s personal-injury action to find a \u201cbodily injury\u201d or a \u201ccoverage incident\u201d and thus to apply a duty to defend/coverage under the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">{\u00b6 69} Even if we were to view the personal-injury action and the collection action together, we find no claim that requires Continental to defend Ozvath in the collection action. The General Liability Coverage Part requires Continental to pay any sums that \u201cthe insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of \u2018bodily injury\u2019 * * * to which this insurance applies.\u201d It further provides that Continental has the duty to defend against any suit seeking such damages. The injury to Harbin\u2019s hand constituted a \u201cbodily injury.\u201d However, the policy excludes coverage for bodily injury to \u201can employee of the insured arising out of and in the course of the employment by the insured\u201d as well as bodily injury where the injury is \u201cexpected or intended from the standpoint of the insured.\u201d With respect to Ohi-Tec, Harbin\u2019s employer, the policy did not apply to Harbin\u2019s injury because a jury found that the injury resulted from an employer intentional tort, i.e., that Ohi-Tec knew that the injury was substantially certain to occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">{\u00b6 70} Ozvath argued, and the trial court agreed, that the jury in the personal-injury action did not make any determination with respect to Ozvath (because Ozvath was not a party to that action), and there were no allegations that Ozvath had personally intended or expected Harbin to be injured. In this respect, the trial court considered only the allegations in the personal-injury action and did not consider the allegations in the collection action.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">{\u00b6 71} The complaint in the collection action sought to recover on the judgment against Ohi-Tec for its employer intentional tort against Harbin; the complaint in the personal-injury action did not include any claim against Ozvath personally. However, the collection-action complaint alleged that \u201cCharles Ozvath exercised such control and dominion over Ohi-Tec Manufacturing, Inc. that Ohi-Tec Manufacturing, Inc. has not had and/or does not have a separate mind, will, or existence of its own, and/or Defendant is the mere \u2018alter ego\u2019 of Ohi-Tec Manufacturing, Inc.\u201d Harbin further alleged that Ozvath had engaged in fraudulent conduct to \u201cprotect himself from liability for his own misdeeds, including but not limited to committing intentional tortious conduct to employees.\u201d Through these and other allegations, Harbin has alleged that Ozvath stands in the shoes of Ohi-Tec and that Ozvath had the same intent as Ohi-Tec. In essence, Harbin has claimed that Ozvatb/Ohi-Tec expected or intended the bodily injury to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>Harbin and that Ozvath engaged in fraudulent business practices with respect to Ohi-Tec in order to avoid personal liability for the employer intentional tort and to eliminate any probability of collection by Harbin from the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\">{\u00b6 72} Continental represented Ohi-Tec in the personal-injury action due to allegations of negligence by the corporation, and such claims were arguably within Ohi-Tec\u2019s coverage. However, there were no allegations in the collection action related to negligence, as the judgment in the personal-injury action was based solely on an employer intentional tort.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">{\u00b6 73} Thus, reading the personal-injury and collection complaints together, Harbin\u2019s original complaint in the collection action did not allege \u201c \u2018bodily injury\u2019 * * * to which this insurance applies.\u201d The collection action did not involve negligence and, instead, sought through various business-fraud torts to recover employer-intentional-tort damages, for which Ozvath was allegedly responsible as the alter ego of Ohi-Tec, with the same intent, expectations, and beliefs as the corporation. Such a claim is excluded under the Buckeye policy. And under the terms of the Buckeye policy, Continental had no duty to defend Ozvath against a suit that does not seek damages for \u201c \u2018bodily injury\u2019 * * * to which this insurance applies.\u201d Accordingly, the trial court erred in determining that Continental had a duty to defend Ozvath in the collection action. Rather, the trial court should have determined, as a matter of law, that Continental had no duty to defend Ozvath in the collection action.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">{\u00b6 74} We further note that in January 2006, Harbin filed a second amended complaint in the collection action, which changed the nature of that litigation. A similar, third amended complaint was filed in June 2006. The caption of the third amended complaint identified the plaintiff as \u201cRobert Harbin, with derivative standing, for the Estate of Ohi-Tec Manufacturing, Inc.\u201d The body of the complaint further indicated that the bankruptcy court had granted Harbin derivative standing to pursue claims against Ozvath and his family \u201con behalf of the Estate of Ohi-Tec.\u201d The various claims alleged that Ozvath\u2019s actions had caused loss to the estate of Ohi-Tec and creditors of Ohi-Tec. Consequently, the third amended complaint no longer directly sought payment from Ozvath for the employer-intentional-tort judgment. Rather, it sought, among other things, a \u201cjudgment that one [or] more Defendants is liable for the debts of the Estate of Ohi-Tec Manufacturing, Inc. as shall be determined in later proceedings in the matter of <em>In re Ohi-Tec Manufacturing, Inc., </em>currently pending in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Ohio.\u201d Although Harbin\u2019s standing was based on his status as a judgment creditor of Ohi-Tec, the direct connection between Harbin\u2019s personal-injury judgment and the derivative action was more attenuated, as Harbin sought damages for Ozvath\u2019s allegedly fraudu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>lent business conduct on behalf of the Ohi-Tec bankruptcy estate and its other creditors as well as himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">{\u00b6 75} Continental\u2019s first assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">{\u00b6 76} Continental raises the following additional assignments of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b706-8\">{\u00b6 77} \u201cThe trial court erred in not determining that appellant CNA was prejudiced by Charles Ozvath\u2019s extremely late notice of a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-9\">{\u00b6 78} \u201cThe trial court erred in making a supplemental award of attorney fees to appellee Mr. Ozvath.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-10\">{\u00b6 79} \u201cThe trial court erred by awarding prejudgment interest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b706-11\">{\u00b6 80} Ozvath also raises the following cross-assignments of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b706-12\">{\u00b6 81} \u201cThe trial court erred in overruling Chuck Ozvath\u2019s motion for summary judgment for indemnification of the collection litigation settlement amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-13\">{\u00b6 82} \u201cThe trial court erred in determining the amount of attorney fees and prejudgment interest to award to Chuck Ozvath.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b706-14\">{\u00b6 88} In light of our disposition of Continental\u2019s first assignment of error, Continental\u2019s additional assignments of error and Ozvath\u2019s cross-assignments of error are overruled as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-15\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b706-16\">{\u00b6 84} The trial court\u2019s judgment in favor of Ozvath is reversed, and the case is remanded for the trial court to enter judgment in favor of Continental.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-17\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b706-18\">Donovan and Hall, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b696-8\">.
