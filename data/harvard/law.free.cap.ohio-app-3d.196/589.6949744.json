Starks, appeals pro se his conviction in the Franklin Municipal Court for one count of speeding in violation of R.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>4511.21(D)(1), a minor misdemeanor. For the reasons set forth below, we reverse the decision of the trial court and discharge Starks.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">{\u00b6 2} On June 24, 2010, Trooper Eric Witmeyer of the Ohio State Highway Patrol was operating a stationary laser device at northbound traffic on Interstate 75 at mile post 40 in Franklin Township. This particular portion of the interstate was located in a construction zone, and the posted speed limit was 55 m.p.h. Witmeyer testified that he observed Starks\u2019s vehicle in the left-hand lane, passing other vehicles on the interstate. He further testified that in his estimation, Starks was \u201cexceeding the posted 55 [m.p.h.] limit.\u201d Witmeyer activated his LTI ultra-light laser and received a reading that Starks\u2019s vehicle was traveling 70 m.p.h. Trooper Witmeyer initiated a traffic stop and issued Starks a citation for speeding in violation of R.C. 4511.21(D)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">{\u00b6 3} Starks entered a plea of not guilty, and a bench trial was held on July 23, 2010, during which Starks appeared pro se. The trial court took the matter under advisement, and in an entry dated July 27, 2010, found Starks guilty of speeding. Starks was fined $150 and ordered to pay court costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">{\u00b6 4} Starks appeals the trial court\u2019s entry, raising five assignments of error for our review.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For ease of discussion and because Starks\u2019s third assignment of error is dispositive of this appeal, we will address the assignments out of order.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">{\u00b6 5} Assignment of Error No. 3:</p>\n<p id=\"b627-9\">{\u00b6 6} \u201cThe trial judge erred when he allowed judicial notice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b627-10\">{\u00b6 7} In his third assignment of error, Starks contends that the trial court erred in taking judicial notice of the scientific reliability of the LTI ultra-light laser.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-11\">{\u00b6 8} At trial, the state questioned Trooper Witmeyer regarding the steps he took to \u201cassure that [his] laser speed detection device was in proper working order.\u201d Starks objected on the basis of judicial notice, stating \u201c[t]here is no judicial notice in this jurisdiction about laser [sic].\u201d Thereafter, the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<p id=\"b627-12\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cThe Court: Well, Mr. Starks, he hasn\u2019t asked you to take judicial notice, he\u2019s asked whether he had calibrated his laser so your objection is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-13\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cMr. Starks: Can, can I finish my (inaudible).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-14\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cThe Court: Sure, go ahead.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>{\u00b6 12} \u201cMr. Starks: There is, there\u2019s no documentation of a (inaudible) hearing in this jurisdiction that (inaudible) laser gun type device is accurate to a legal degree of certainty and admissible as scientific evidence to a speeding violation. Unless the prosecution intends to bring in expert testimony from a recognized expert[ ] in the field, I object to any testimony concerning reading from a laser speed laser device.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cThe Court: Have you identified which laser detection device it was yet, [prosecutor]?</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">{\u00b6 14} \u201c[Prosecutor]: Not yet.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cThe Court: Can you ask him to identify which laser?</p>\n<p id=\"b628-8\">{\u00b6 16} \u201c[Prosecutor]: Sure.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-9\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cThe Court: And I\u2019ll rule on that in a second.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-10\">{\u00b6 18} \u201c[Prosecutor]: Sergeant Witmeyer, what\u2019s, what\u2019s the type of laser device you\u2019re using?</p>\n<p id=\"b628-11\">{\u00b6 19} \u201c[Witness]: It was a laser LTI ultra-light.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-12\">{\u00b6 20} \u201cThe Court: Mr. Starks, the LTI ultra-light has been recognized as a scientifically accurate instrument by the [Twelfth] District Court of Appeals. This Court has the right to rely on their judicial notice and their findings that it is a scientifically accurate piece of equipment. For that reason I will overrule your objection.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b628-13\">{\u00b6 21} In order to be convicted of speeding based on laser-device evidence, there must be evidence introduced at trial that the device is scientifically reliable. <em>State v. Palmer, </em>Hamilton App. No. C-050750, 2006-Ohio-5456, 2006 WL 2987715, \u00b6 10, citing <em>E. Cleveland v. Ferell </em>(1958), 168 Ohio St. 298, 301, 154 N.E.2d 630. It is well established that the scientific reliability of a laser device used to measure speed is a fact that is subject to judicial notice. <em>State v. Dawson </em>(Dec. 21, 1998), Madison App. No. CA98-04-021, 1998 WL 883802. Pursuant to Evid.R. 201(B), \u201c[a] judicially noticed fact must be one not subject to reasonable dispute in that it is either (1) generally known within the territorial jurisdiction of the trial court or (2) capable of accurate and ready determination by resort to sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b628-14\">{\u00b6 22} The reliability of a particular speed-measuring device can be established through \u201c(1) a reported municipal court decision, (2) a reported or unreported case from the appellate court, or (3) the previous consideration of expert testimony about a specific device where the trial court notes it on the record.\u201d <em>Cincinnati v. Levine, </em>158 Ohio App.3d 657, 2004-Ohio-5992, 821 N.E.2d 613, \u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>{\u00b6 23} This court has previously recognized that a trial court may take judicial notice of the scientific reliability of the LTI 20-20 laser device. <em>Dawson </em>at 5; <em>State v. Bell </em>(Jan. 16, 1998), Madison App. No. CA96-07-027, 1998 WL 37486, 9. However, we have not recognized the reliability of the LTI ultra-light. In addition, our survey of the reported municipal court case law in this district has not revealed a decision that has considered the scientific reliability of this particular device.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">{\u00b6 24} We are aware that other courts have concluded that expert testimony regarding the reliability of various models of laser and radar devices is irrelevant for purposes of judicial notice because \u201c[i]t is the scientific principle underlying a device\u2019s reliability \u2014 and not the reliability of a specific model \u2014 that renders judicial notice proper.\u201d <em>State v. Wiest, </em>Hamilton App. No. C-070609, 2008-Ohio-1433, 2008 WL 821801, \u00b6 12; <em>State v. Yaun, </em>Logan App. No. 8-07-22, 2008-Ohio-1902, 2008 WL 1789892, \u00b6 18. In <em>Yaun, </em>the Third Appellate District determined that the trial court did not err in taking judicial notice of the Python II radar device when it had previously taken judicial notice of the K-55 device. Id. at \u00b6 19. The police officer in <em>Yaun </em>testified that the Python II radar operated on the same principle as other radar devices and that it was \u201cexactly the same radar as the K-55.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 14. In this case, however, there was no testimony from Trooper Witmeyer that the LTI 20-20 and the LTI ultra-light operated under the same scientific principle such that they could be deemed different models of the same device. As a result, we conclude that the trial court erred in taking judicial notice of the LTI ultra-light laser absent expert testimony with regard to its reliability.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">{\u00b6 25} Although the underlying principles of laser technology may be the same from one device to another, generally judicial notice as to the reliability of a speed-measuring device is device-specific. <em>State v. Kincaid, </em>124 Ohio Misc.2d 92, 2003-Ohio-4632, 796 N.E.2d 89, \u00b6 15. Therefore, expert testimony is necessary, \u201cwhether it be a new device or an upgrade of an existing device, before the court may take judicial notice of that particular device in future proceedings.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">{\u00b6 26} Notwithstanding the trial court\u2019s error, we note that Starks raises the issue of the reliability of this specific laser device for the first time on appeal. Our review of the record reveals that at trial, Starks objected generally to the admissibility of \u201claser-gun type device[s].\u201d He did not object to the reliability of the LTI ultra-light following Trooper Witmeyer\u2019s testimony, nor did he move to strike this testimony. Pursuant to Evid.R. 103, Starks has therefore forfeited all but plain error on appeal. Crim.R. 52(B); <em>State v. Kline, </em>Warren App. No. CA2004-10-125, 2005-Ohio-4336, 2005 WL 2001509, \u00b6 10; <em>State v. Gellenbeck, </em>Fayette App. No. CA2008-08-030, 2009-Ohio-1731, 2009 WL 975746, \u00b6 24, \u00b6 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>{\u00b6 27} Plain error exists where there is an obvious deviation from a legal rule that affected the defendant\u2019s substantial rights or influenced the outcome of the proceedings. <em>State v. Blanda, </em>Butler App. No. CA2010-03-050, 2011-Ohio-411, 2011 WL 332725, \u00b6 20, citing <em>State v. Barnes </em>(2002), 94 Ohio St.3d 21, 27, 759 N.E.2d 1240. Appellate courts are admonished to notice plain error \u201c \u2018with the utmost caution, under exceptional circumstances and only to prevent a manifest miscarriage of justice.\u2019 \u201d <em>Barnes </em>at 27, quoting <em>State v. Long </em>(1978), 53 Ohio St.2d 91, 372 N.E.2d 804, paragraph three of the syllabus. Accordingly, an appellate court will not reverse a trial court\u2019s decision on plain-error grounds unless the outcome of the trial would have been different absent the alleged error. <em>State v. Stout, </em>Warren App. No. CA2010-04-039, 2010-Ohio-4799, 2010 WL 3836158, \u00b6 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">{\u00b6 28} Although the trial court erred in taking judicial notice of the reliability of the ultra-light laser, we must also determine whether the court\u2019s error was outcome-determinative, thus rising to the level of plain error. Our inquiry turns to whether the result of Starks\u2019s trial would have been different absent the laser-device evidence. The Ohio Supreme Court has held that \u201c[a] police officer\u2019s unaided visual estimation of a vehicle\u2019s speed is sufficient evidence to support a conviction for speeding in violation of R.C. 4511.21(D) without independent verification of the vehicle\u2019s speed if the officer is trained, is certified by the Ohio Peace Officer Training Academy or a similar organization that develops and implements training programs to meet the needs of law-enforcement professionals and the communities they serve, and is experienced in visually estimating vehicle speed.\u201d <em>Barberton v. Jenney, </em>126 Ohio St.3d 5, 2010-Ohio-2420, 929 N.E.2d 1047, syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">{\u00b6 29} In <em>Barberton, </em>the Supreme Court concluded that a police officer\u2019s visual estimation of the defendant\u2019s speed was sufficient to support a conviction under R.C. 4511.21(D) because there was testimony offered at trial as to the officer\u2019s certification, training, and experience in visually estimating vehicle speeds. Id. at \u00b6 22. Specifically, the officer testified that he was trained to visually estimate vehicle speed, was certified by a law-enforcement training organization in visual estimations, and had performed hundreds of visual speed estimations as a police officer. Id. at \u00b6 21. The officer further testified that based on his training and experience, he had estimated that the defendant\u2019s vehicle was traveling 70 m.p.h. in a 60 m.p.h. zone at the time of the traffic stop. Id. at \u00b6 21-22.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">{\u00b6 30} In this case, the totality of Witmeyer\u2019s testimony was that Starks was \u201cexceeding the posted 55 [m.p.h.] limit.\u201d Although he testified that he had been with the highway patrol for approximately 24 years, there was no testimony as to his training, certification, or experience in visually estimating vehicle speed. He also faded to offer testimony regarding his estimate of the speed at which he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>believed Starks was traveling. As a result, we find Trooper Witmeyer\u2019s testimony as to his visual observation of Starks\u2019s speed insufficient under <em>Barberton. </em>See also <em>State v. Riddle, </em>Ottawa App. No. OT-10-040, 2011-Ohio-1547, 2011 WL 1204750, \u00b6 21 (concluding that state trooper\u2019s testimony did not satisfy <em>Barberton </em>because there was no discussion as to his certification or experience in visual speed estimation, and he testified only that the defendant was \u201cdriving over the speed limit\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">{\u00b6 31} Because we have ruled that the laser device\u2019s reading as to Starks\u2019s speed should not have been admitted, and because the record lacks any other evidence that Starks was speeding, his speeding conviction must be reversed based upon insufficient evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">{\u00b6 32} Based on the foregoing, Starks\u2019s third assignment of error is well taken and sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">{\u00b6 33} Assignment of Error No. 5:</p>\n<p id=\"b631-8\">{\u00b6 34} \u201cThe trial judge erred because there was insufficient evidence to convict Starks of violating 4511.2101.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b631-9\">{\u00b6 35} In his fifth assignment of error, Starks claims that there was insufficient evidence to convict him of violating \u201cordinance 4511.2101.\u201d Starks argues that the citation issued by Trooper Witmeyer indicates that he was charged with violating this ordinance and that because Starks could \u201cfind no evidence of ordinance 4511.2101,\u201d the prosecution failed to meet its burden of proof in this case. Contrary to Starks\u2019s argument, however, the record clearly indicates that he was charged and convicted of violating R.C. 4511.21(D)(1). His fifth assignment of error is accordingly overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-10\">{\u00b6 36} Assignment of Error No. 1:</p>\n<p id=\"b631-11\">{\u00b6 37} \u201cThe trial judge erred because [the] laser gun was not properly tested.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b631-12\">{\u00b6 38} Assignment of Error No. 2:</p>\n<p id=\"b631-13\">{\u00b6 39} \u201cThe trial judge erred when he ignored that officer [Witmeyer]\u2019s training had not been established.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b631-14\">{\u00b6 40} Assignment of Error No. 4:</p>\n<p id=\"b631-15\">{\u00b6 41} \u201cThe trial judge erred when he did not require [the] prosecution to produce [a] traffic engineering survey.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b631-16\">{\u00b6 42} In his remaining assignments of error, Starks challenges the sufficiency of Trooper Witmeyer\u2019s testimony with regard to the condition of the laser on the day of the traffic stop and whether he was qualified to administer the device. He also argues that the state was required to produce a traffic-engineering survey in order to convict him of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>{\u00b6 43} In light of our determination in Starks\u2019s third assignment of error, we decline to address the remaining assignments and overrule them as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">{\u00b6 44} The judgment is reversed, and Starks is discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b632-7\">Hendrickson, P.J., and Ringland, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b627-15\">. The record indicates that the state failed to file an appellate brief in this matter. As a result, this court may accept Starks\u2019s statement of the facts and issues as correct and reverse the judgment if his brief reasonably appears to sustain such an action. See App.R. 18(C).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
