Boyle, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b619-9\">{\u00b6 1} Defendant-appellant, Squires Construction Company, appeals from the trial court\u2019s decision denying its motion to stay and compel arbitration on the breach-of-contract and unjust-enrichment claims of plaintiffs-appellees, William Taylor, Ruthanne Tindell, and Dan Davis. Finding some merit to the appeal, we reverse and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-10\">Procedural History and Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b619-11\">{\u00b6 2} In January 2011, plaintiffs collectively filed the underlying action against Squires, asserting two claims: (1) breach of written or verbal contract and (2) unjust enrichment. According to the complaint, plaintiffs \u201csolicited and engaged customers on behalf of Squires for which [they] were entitled to commissions or payment.\u201d Specifically, Taylor sought $39,529.07 in damages, Tindell sought $26,610.47, and Davis sought $10,051.54.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-12\">{\u00b6 3} In lieu of an answer, on February 11, 2011, Squires filed a \u201cmotion to stay and motion to compel arbitration,\u201d arguing that it had executed separate written agreements with both Taylor and Davis that contained an arbitration provision requiring any dispute to be settled by arbitration. As for Tindell, Squires acknowledged that she never had executed a contract with Squires but argued that her claims, too, should be submitted to arbitration because of her \u201cconnection and working arrangements with defendant Davis.\u201d According to its motion, Tindell is a friend of Davis, and Davis requested that \u201ccertain of his compensation be assigned to Tindell.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b619-13\">{\u00b6 4} In support of its motions, Squires attached (1) \u201cIndependent Sales Representative/Dealer Agreement,\u201d allegedly executed between Taylor and Squires, and (2) \u201cSub-Contractor\u2019s Agreement,\u201d allegedly executed between Davis and Squires. Both agreements contained an identical arbitration provision, stating: \u201cAny controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement or breach thereof, shall be settled by arbitration in Cleveland Ohio in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association and judgement upon the award may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>{\u00b6 5} Less than two weeks later, on February 24, the trial court denied the motion to compel, noting that Squires\u2019s Exhibit A, the \u201cIndependent Sales Representative/Dealer Agreement,\u201d did not contain a valid execution page.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">{\u00b6 6} From that decision, Squires appeals, raising the following four assignments of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">{\u00b6 7} \u201c[I.] The trial court erred by failing to apply the provisions of R.C. 2711.01 and 2711.02. In so doing, the trial court negated the existence and enforceability of the parties\u2019 Agreement to Arbitrate.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">{\u00b6 8} \u201c[II.] The trial court erred in sua sponte denying Squires\u2019 Motion to Compel Arbitration without a hearing or a trial on a factual issue as to the date of William Taylor\u2019s signature on the Independent Sales Representative/Dealer Agreement. The said Agreement is clearly dated September 8,1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-8\">{\u00b6 9} \u201c[III.] The trial court erred in not providing for arbitration concerning plaintiff Dan Davis when Dan Davis\u2019 Sub-Contractor\u2019s Agreement, exhibit B, provides for mandatory arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-9\">{\u00b6 10} \u201c[IV.] The trial court erred in not providing for arbitration concerning Ruthann Tindell. Ruthann Tindell\u2019s claims are subject to arbitration along with the other plaintiffs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b620-10\">{\u00b6 11} Because they are related, we will address these assignments of error together.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-11\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b620-12\">{\u00b6 12} We are reviewing the trial court\u2019s denial of Squires\u2019s motion to stay and motion to compel arbitration after it found that the parties had not executed a valid contract to enforce arbitration. The pivotal issue is whether the parties had agreed to arbitrate pursuant to a valid contract. The resolution of the issue therefore involves contract interpretation \u2014 a matter requiring the de novo standard of review applied to contract construction. <em>N. Park Retirement Comm. Ctr., Inc. v. Sovran Cos. Ltd., </em>8th Dist. No. 96376, 2011-Ohio-5179, 2011 WL 4600700, \u00b6 3, citing <em>Vanyo v. Clear Channel Worldwide, </em>156 Ohio App.3d 706, 2004-Ohio-1793, 808 N.E.2d 482, \u00b6 8 (\u201cThe issue of whether a controversy is arbitrable under the provisions of a written contract is a question of law for the trial court to decide\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-13\">The Ohio Arbitration Act</p>\n<p id=\"b620-14\">{\u00b6 13} In <em>Taylor Bldg. Corp. of Am. v. Benfield, </em>117 Ohio St.3d 352, 2008-Ohio-938, 884 N.E.2d 12, \u00b6 25-27, the Ohio Supreme Court set forth the law on arbitration:</p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>{\u00b6 14} \u201cThe Ohio General Assembly in R.C. Chapter 2711 has expressed a strong policy favoring arbitration of disputes. R.C. 2711.01(A) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">{\u00b6 15} \u201c \u2018A provision in any written contract * * * to settle by arbitration a controversy that subsequently arises out of the contract, or out of the refusal to perform the whole or any part of the contract, or any agreement in wilting between two or more persons to submit to arbitration any controversy existing between them at the time of the agreement to submit, or arising after the agreement to submit, * * * shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, except upon grounds that exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">{\u00b6 16} \u201cIndeed, the Ohio courts recognize a \u2018presumption favoring arbitration\u2019 that arises \u2018when the claim in dispute falls within the scope of the arbitration provision.\u2019 <em>Williams v. Aetna Fin. Co. </em>(1998), 83 Ohio St.3d 464, 471, 700 N.E.2d 859; see also <em>Ignazio v. Clear Channel Broadcasting, Inc., </em>113 Ohio St.3d 276, 2007-Ohio-1947, 865 N.E.2d 18, \u00b6 18.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">{\u00b6 17} Additionally, the Ohio Supreme Court has recognized that R.C. Chapter 2711 authorizes direct enforcement of arbitration agreements through an order to compel arbitration pursuant to R.C. 2711.03 and indirect enforcement of such agreements pursuant to an order staying trial court proceedings under R.C. 2711.02. <em>Maestle v. Best Buy Co., </em>100 Ohio St.3d 330, 2003-Ohio-6465, 800 N.E.2d 7, \u00b6 14. A party may choose to move for a stay, petition for an order to proceed to arbitration, or seek both. Id. at \u00b6 18. In <em>Maestle, </em>the Ohio Supreme Court made it clear that a motion to compel arbitration and a motion to stay proceedings are separate and distinct procedures that serve different purposes. Id. at \u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-8\">{\u00b6 18} Under R.C. 2711.02(B), \u201c[i]f any action is brought upon any issue referable to arbitration under an agreement in writing for arbitration, the court in which the action is pending, upon being satisfied that the issue involved in the action is referable to arbitration under an agreement in writing for arbitration, shall on application of one of the parties stay the trial of the action until the arbitration of the issue has been had in accordance with the agreement * * *.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b622-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>{\u00b6 19} R.C. 2711.03(A) provides that a party \u201cmay petition * * * for an order directing that the arbitration proceed in the manner provided for in the written agreement. * * * The court shall hear the parties, and, upon being satisfied that the making of the agreement for arbitration or the failure to comply with the agreement is not in issue, the court shall make an order directing the parties to proceed to arbitration in accordance with the agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">{\u00b6 20} Under R.C. 2711.03(B), \u201c[i]f the making of the arbitration agreement or the failure to perform it is in issue in a petition filed under division (A) of this section, the court shall proceed summarily to the trial of that issue. If no jury trial is demanded as provided in this division, the court shall hear and determine that issue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">{\u00b6 21} With these principles in mind and applying a de novo standard of review, we turn to Squires\u2019s first three assignments of error involving whether Taylor\u2019s and Davis\u2019s claims should have been referred to arbitration based on the two written contracts containing arbitration provisions. And based on the record before us, we find that the trial court erred in denying Squires\u2019s motions without first holding an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">Necessity of a Hearing on a Motion to Compel Arbitration</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">{\u00b6 22} In <em>Maestle, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 330, 2003-Ohio-6465, 800 N.E.2d 7, the Ohio Supreme Court held that a trial court is not required to conduct a hearing when a party moves for a stay pursuant to R.C. 2711.02, but may stay proceedings \u201c \u2018upon being satisfied that the issue involved in the action is referable to arbitration under an agreement in writing for arbitration.\u2019 \u201d Id. at \u00b6 7. The court reasoned, \u201c[T]hat statute does not on its face require a hearing, and it is not appropriate to read an implicit requirement into the statute.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-8\">{\u00b623} Pursuant to R.C. 2711.03, however, where a party has filed a motion to compel arbitration, the court must, in a hearing, make a determination as to the validity of the arbitration clause. <em>Maestle </em>at \u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-9\">(\u00b6 24} Plaintiffs contend that the trial court did not err in failing to hold a hearing because Squires never requested an oral hearing or referred in its motion to R.C. 2711.03 \u2014 the statutory provision giving rise to the hearing requirement. While we recognize that Squires merely captioned its motion as a \u201cmotion to compel\u201d but then failed to request an oral hearing and further failed to comply with the procedural requirements of R.C. 2711.03, we nonetheless find that the trial court erred in failing to hold a hearing as to the claims of Taylor and Davis.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-10\">{\u00b6 25} The first contract at issue, \u201cIndependent Sales Representative/Dealer Agreement,\u201d identified William Taylor and Squires as the two parties to the agreement. On the last page of the contract, the signature of Taylor appears at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>the bottom of the page under the caption \u201cIN THE PRESENCE OF,\u201d instead of the line matching Taylor\u2019s designation in the contract, i.e., \u201cDealer.\u201d Additionally, immediately above the signature lines that contain both Taylor\u2019s signature and Squires\u2019s general manager\u2019s signature is a sentence containing blank spaces as to the date the contract was executed. Based on these defects, the trial court found the agreement unenforceable, noting that it did not contain a valid execution page with the date of the signature of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">{\u00b6 26} But we find that the trial court was unable to determine whether the contract was unenforceable based on the limited record before it. Here, the alleged defects in the contract render it ambiguous, requiring the consideration of parol evidence. See <em>N. Frozen Foods, Inc. v. Picciotti, </em>8th Dist. No. 95493, 2011-Ohio-2399, 2011 WL 1935816, \u00b6 11, citing <em>Crane Hollow, Inc. v. Marathon Ashland Pipe Line, L.L.C. </em>(2000), 138 Ohio App.3d 57, 74, 740 N.E.2d 328, (\u201cIf * * * the contract is ambiguous, ascertaining the parties\u2019 intent constitutes a question of fact that may require the consideration of parol evidence to determine the parties\u2019 intent\u201d). The absence of the date and the placement of the signature, however, do not automatically render the contract unenforceable. See <em>Karako v. Lindberg, </em>11th Dist. No. 97-L-022, (Apr. 10, 1998), 1998 WL 257043 (recognizing that the signature of both parties is not required to establish a valid, written contract). Indeed, given the strong presumption in favor of arbitration, the trial court should not have immediately disregarded the contract as unenforceable without first allowing the parties to present parol evidence to resolve the ambiguities in the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">{\u00b6 27} Next, we likewise find that the trial court erred in summarily dismissing the arbitration provision contained in the \u201cSub-Contractor\u2019s Agreement\u201d without first holding a hearing on Squires\u2019s motion to compel Davis to submit to arbitration. On appeal, Davis contends that Squires failed to establish that he is the same person identified in the agreement because the names are different\u2014 the agreement refers to \u201cW. Daniel Davis\u201d as opposed to \u201cDan Davis.\u201d Again, this is an issue that can easily be resolved at a hearing. If in fact the \u201cSubContractor\u2019s Agreement\u201d was not executed between Squires and the plaintiff-Davis, then Davis cannot be forced to arbitrate his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">{\u00b6 28} We further note that the trial court denied Squires\u2019s motion to stay and motion to compel arbitration prior to any of the plaintiffs\u2019 responses to the motion. Plaintiffs have not raised any issues regarding the arbitration provisions being unconscionable or outside the scope of their claims. Prior to having any hearing, the trial court should afford Taylor and Davis the opportunity to respond to Squires\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">{\u00b6 29} In its final assignment of error, Squires argues that the trial court erred in failing to find that Tindell was subject to arbitration \u201cdue to her connection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>and working arrangements with Davis.\u201d Although Squires acknowledges that Tindell never executed any written agreement binding her to arbitration, it contends that she should nonetheless be subject to arbitration under an equitable-estoppel or agency theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">{\u00b6 30} Generally, it is well settled that a court cannot compel parties to arbitrate disputes that they have not agreed in writing to arbitrate. <em>I Sports v. IMG Worldwide, Inc., </em>157 Ohio App.3d 593, 2004-Ohio-3113, 813 N.E.2d 4, \u00b6 10. But courts have recognized some limited exceptions to the rule, such as when a nonsignatory\u2019s conduct indicates that he or she assumes the obligation and intends to be bound by the arbitration clause. Id. at \u00b6 13. Traditional principles of agency may be applied to bind a nonsignatory to an arbitration agreement. Similarly, under an estoppel theory, \u201ca nonsignatory who knowingly accepts the benefits of an agreement is estopped from denying a corresponding obligation to arbitrate.\u201d Id. See also <em>Short v. Resource Title Agency, Inc., </em>8th Dist. No. 95839, 2011-Ohio-1577, 2011 WL 1203906, \u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">{\u00b6 31} Here, we find that the record is insufficient to determine whether either of these theories apply. Although Squires alleged that Tindell had a \u201cclose relation\u201d to Davis, we find that this allegation alone fails to establish an agency relationship. But if Tindell is seeking to recover from Squires\u2019s commissions set forth in Davis\u2019s agreement \u2014 the same agreement that contains the arbitration provision \u2014 then Tindell may be subject to arbitration. Because the record is unclear, this too is a matter that can be resolved at a hearing on Squires\u2019s motion to stay and compel arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">{\u00b6 32} Accordingly, we partially sustain the first assignment of error, sustain the second assignment of error, and overrule the third and fourth assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-8\">{\u00b6 33} The judgment reversed and the case is remanded to the lower court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-9\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b624-10\">Kilbane, A.J., and Sweeney, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b621-9\">. Ohio's strong policy favoring arbitration is consistent with federal law supporting arbitration. See Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. 2 (\"A written provision in * * * a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce to settle by arbitration a controversy thereafter arising out of such contract or transaction, or the refusal to perform the whole or any part thereof, or an agreement in writing to submit to arbitration an existing controversy arising out of such a contract, transaction, or refusal, shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
