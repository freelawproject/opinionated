(\u201cEMH &amp; T\u201d), appeals from a judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas in favor of defendant-appellee, Triad Architects, Ltd. (\u201cTriad\u201d). For the following reasons, we reverse the judgment and remand the cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-9\">{\u00b6 2} In January 2007, Triad entered into an agreement with Centurion Development Group, L.L.C. (\u201cCenturion\u201d) to provide architectural and engineering plans for a residential development that Centurion wanted to build. Triad asked EMH &amp; T to supply civil-engineering services on the project. On January 22, 2007, Triad and EMH &amp; T executed a contract whereby Triad agreed to pay EMH &amp; T $128,550 for environmental- and engineering-due-diligence work, surveys, and development plans, as well as additional specified services.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-10\">{\u00b6 3} Centurion also hired Triad to work on another development project. In a second contract with Centurion, Triad agreed to provide architectural and engineering plans for a nine-story condominium building. Again, Triad turned to EMH &amp; T for the civil-engineering work on the project. On July 9, 2007, Triad and EMH &amp; T entered into a contract whereby Triad agreed to pay EMH &amp; T $60,200 for a construction plan, landscape plan, topographical survey, geotechnical investigation, and other services.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-11\">{\u00b6 4} For the most part, Triad and EMH &amp; T relied on the American Institute of Architects (\u201cALA\u201d) Standard Form of Agreement Between Architect and Consultant (Document C141-1997) to supply the terms of their January 22 and July 9, 2007 contracts. Thus, both contracts provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b823-12\">\u00a7 12.5 Payments to the Consultant shall be made promptly after the Architect is paid by the Owner under the Prime Agreement. The Architect shall exert reasonable and diligent efforts to collect prompt payment from the Owner. The Architect shall pay the Consultant in proportion to amounts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>received from the Owner which are attributable to the Consultant\u2019s services rendered.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b824-4\">In both contracts, the parties added the following term to the ATA form agreement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-5\">\u00a7 13.4.3 * * * The Consultant shall be paid for their services under this Agreement within ten (10) working days after receipt by the Architect from the Owner of payment for the services performed by the Consultant on behalf of their Part of the Project.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">{\u00b6 5} EMH &amp; T substantially completed all services required under the two contracts by December 11, 2007. EMH &amp; T then billed Triad a total of $150,482.29. Triad, however, refused to pay. In response to EMH &amp; T\u2019s attempts to recover payment, Triad contended that sections 12.5 and 13.4.3 of the parties\u2019 contracts required it to pay EMH &amp; T only when and to the extent that Centurion paid it. Centurion canceled both projects and refused to pay Triad. Because Triad never collected payment from Centurion, Triad disclaimed any obligation to pay EMH &amp; T.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-7\">{\u00b6 6} EMH &amp; T filed suit against Triad, asserting claims for an account stated, professional services rendered, breach of contract, and unjust enrichment. Both parties moved for summary judgment. On November 17, 2010, the trial court entered a decision and final judgment granting Triad\u2019s motion for summary judgment and denying EMH &amp; T\u2019s motion for summary judgment. EMH &amp; T now appeals from that judgment, and it assigns the following errors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-8\">The trial court erred in overruling Plaintiff-Appellant\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment when it failed to consider established Ohio case law and construction industry standards in deciding that the language contained in the parties\u2019 contracts with respect to payment by Appellee constituted a \u201cpay-if-paid\u201d rather than \u201cpay-when-paid\u201d obligation as a matter of law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-9\">The trial court erred in sustaining Defendanb-Appellee\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment since the pleadings and affidavits filed by DefendantAppellee are inadequate and inadmissible as parol evidence, but even if considered, create rather than eliminate genuine issues of material fact.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b824-10\">{\u00b6 7} Because EMH &amp; T\u2019s two assignments of error are interrelated, we will address them together. Both assignments of error challenge the trial court\u2019s ruling on the parties\u2019 motions for summary judgment. Entry of summary judgment is appropriate when the moving party demonstrates that (1) there is no genuine issue of material fact, (2) the.moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and (3) reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion when viewing the evidence most strongly in favor of the nonmoving party, and that conclusion is adverse to the nonmoving party. <em>Hudson v. Petrosurance, Inc., </em>127 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>Ohio St.3d 54, 2010-Ohio-4505, 936 N.E.2d 481, \u00b6 29; <em>Sinnott v. Aqua-Chem, Inc., </em>116 Ohio St.3d 158, 2007-Ohio-5584, \u00b629. Appellate review of a trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion for summary judgment is de novo. <em>Hudson </em>at \u00b6 29. This means that an appellate court conducts an independent review without deference to the trial court\u2019s determination. <em>Zurz v. 770 W. Broad AGA, L.L.C., </em>192 Ohio App.3d 521, 2011-Ohio-832, 949 N.E.2d 595, \u00b65; <em>White v. Westfall, </em>183 Ohio App.3d 807, 2009-Ohio-4490, 919 N.E.2d 227, \u00b6 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-4\">{\u00b6 8} The parties\u2019 dispute centers on the meaning of the contractual language setting forth Triad\u2019s obligation to pay EMH &amp; T. Triad argues that sections 12.5 and 13.4.3 create a condition precedent: it must receive payment from Centurion for its duty to pay EMH &amp; T to arise. According to Triad\u2019s interpretation of the parties\u2019 contracts, it owes EMH &amp; T nothing because Centurion did not pay it. EMH &amp; T disagrees, and instead contends that sections 12.5 and 13.4.3 impose on Triad an absolute duty to pay EMH &amp; T within a reasonable time. Under EMH &amp; T\u2019s interpretation, Centurion\u2019s failure to pay Triad does not negate Triad\u2019s obligation to pay EMH &amp; T.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">{\u00b6 9} This dispute is an iteration of a long-standing disagreement between general contractors and subcontractors over the enforcement of \u201cpay-when-paid\u201d and \u201cpay-if-paid\u201d contractual provisions. \u201c \u2018A typical \u201cpay-when-paid\u201d clause might read: \u201cContractor shall pay subcontractor within seven days of contractor\u2019s receipt of payment from the owner.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>MidAmerica Constr. Mgt., Inc. v. MasTec N. Am., Inc. </em>(C.A.10, 2006), 436 F.3d 1257, 1261, quoting Robert F. Carney and Adam Cizek, Payment Provisions in Construction Contacts and Construction Trust Fund Statutes: A Fifty State Survey (Fall 2004), 24 Construction Law. 5, 5. The majority of courts, including Ohio courts, hold that this type of provision means that the contractor\u2019s obligation to make payment is suspended for a reasonable period of time for the contractor to receive payment from the owner.

No. A-740-99TI, 2000 WL 34241102, at *7; 8 Lord, Williston on Contracts (4th Ed.2010) 633, Section 19:59 (\u201cThe majority of courts have long held that * * * [a pay-when-paid] clause will be construed as creating an absolute obligation on the part of the contractor to pay, subject only to a time limitation, so that even if the owner becomes insolvent or otherwise does not pay the contractor, the contractor or its surety will nevertheless be obligated to make payment to the subcontractor\u201d). Thus, a pay-when-paid provision serves as a timing mechanism, and not a condition precedent, for payment. <em>Sloan &amp; Co. v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(C.A.3, 2011), 653 F.3d 175, 179-180; <em>MidAmerica Constr. Mgt., Inc., </em>436 F.3d at 1261; <em>Fed. Ins.

J. Dyer Co., </em>303 F.2d at 661; <em>Sloan &amp; Co., </em>653 F.3d at 183-184. Significantly, a pay-when-paid provision does not shift that risk to the subcontractor. <em>Chapman Excavating Co. v.

Therefore, once a reasonable period of time passes, the contractor must pay the subcontractor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>regardless of whether the owner has paid the contractor. Welin, Appelbaum, and Currie, Ohio Construction Law Manual (2009), Section 10:10.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-4\">{\u00b6 11} Unlike a pay-when-paid provision, a pay-if-paid provision transfers the risk of an owner\u2019s nonpayment from the contractor down through the contracting tiers. <em>Chapman Excavating Co. </em>at \u00b6 22. See also <em>Sloan &amp; Co., </em>653 F.3d at 183-184; <em>MidAmerica Const.

Clarke Corp. </em>at 885, 64 Cal.Rptr.2d 578, 938 P.2d 372.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">{\u00b6 12} A pay-if-paid provision must clearly and unambiguously condition payment to the subcontractor on the receipt of payment from the owner. <em>Kalkreuth Roofing &amp; Sheet Metal, Inc. v. Bogner Constr. Co. </em>(Aug. 27, 1998), 5th Dist. No. 97 CA 59, 1998 WL 666765. See also 8 Lord, Williston on Contracts (4th Ed. 2010) 636, 19:59 (\u201c[I]f the parties clearly do intend that the risk of nonpayment be borne by the subcontractor and clearly express that intent by making the right of the subcontractor to be paid expressly conditional on the receipt of such payment by the contractor from the owner, they may by contract allocate that risk, and the courts will enforce that freely bargained-for allocation of risk\u201d). Payment provisions qualify as pay-if-paid provisions if they expressly state that (1) payment to the contractor is a condition precedent to payment to the subcontractor (as in the above example), (2) the subcontractor is to bear the risk of the owner\u2019s nonpayment (as in the above example), or (3) the subcontractor is to be paid exclusively out of a fund the sole source of which is the owner\u2019s payment to the subcontractor. <em>Sloan &amp; Co., </em>653 F.3d at 187, fn. 9.

A condition precedent is an event that must occur before an obligation in the contract will become effective. <em>Moody v. Ohio Rehab. Servs. Comm., </em>10th Dist. No. 02AP-596, 2002-Ohio-6965, 2002 WL 31819718, \u00b6 9. The nonoccurrence of a condition precedent excuses a party from performing the duty promised under the contract. <em>Adkins v.

Whether a contractual provision is a condition precedent or merely a promise to perform is a question of the parties\u2019 intent. <em>Adkins </em>at \u00b6 32; <em>Hiatt </em>at \u00b6 23; <em>Kaufman v.

A court ascertains that intent from the language of the particular provision, the language of the entire agreement, and the subject matter of the agreement. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-6\">{\u00b6 15} Because the law disfavors conditions precedent, \u201c \u2018whenever possible courts will avoid construing provisions to be such unless the intent of the agreement is plainly to the contrary.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hiatt </em>at \u00b6 23, quoting <em>Rudd v.

This is particularly so when interpreting a contract provision as a condition precedent, rather than as a promise or covenant, would work a forfeiture\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">{\u00b6 16} As the Restatement explains, a forfeiture, in this context, is the denial of compensation that results when the obligee loses its right to the agreed exchange after he has relied substantially, as by performance, on the expectation of that exchange. Restatement of the Law 2d, Contracts, Section 227, Comment <em>b </em>and Section 229, Comment <em>b. </em>To illustrate the rule disfavoring forfeiture, the Restatement offers the following example:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b829-6\">[Ujnder a provision that a duty is to be performed \u201cwhen\u201d an event occurs, it may be doubtful whether it is to be performed only if that event occurs, in which case the event is a condition, or at such time as it would ordinarily occur, in which case the event is referred to merely to measure the passage of time. In the latter case, if the event does not occur[,] some alternative means will be found to measure the passage of time, and the non-occurrence of the event will not prevent the obligor\u2019s duty from becoming one of performance. If the event is a condition, however, the obligee takes the risk that its non-occurrence will discharge the obligor\u2019s duty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b829-7\">Restatement of the Law 2d, Contracts, Section 227, Comment <em>b. </em>See also <em>Franklin Consultants, Inc. </em>(\u201c \u2018The time of performance is sometimes * * * made to depend upon the happening of some event which the parties to the contract do not covenant to cause to happen. The tendency of the courts is to hold that unless the contract shows clearly that such an action is an express condition, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>provision with reference to such act is inserted in order to fix the time of performance, but not to make * * * the happening of such event a condition precedent\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">{\u00b6 17} This example mirrors the situation presented by a typical pay-when-paid provision. A pay-when-paid provision is susceptible to two interpretations; namely, (1) as setting a condition precedent to payment or (2) as fixing the point in time when payment would ordinarily occur. In the face of this ambiguity, courts avoid forfeiture by construing the pay-when-paid provision as a promise to pay and making payment due within a reasonable time. <em>R.N. Robinson &amp; Son, Inc. </em>at 886; <em>Lafayette Steel Erectors, Inc. </em>at 587; <em>Brown &amp; Kerr, Inc. v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co. </em>(N.D.Ill.1996), 940 F.Supp. 1245, 1250; <em>Fed. Ins. Co. </em>at 739-740 (\u201c[T]he preferred interpretation for the pay-when-paid clause * * * is one that minimizes the risk of forfeiture to [the subcontractor]\u201d); <em>Main Elec., Ltd. </em>at 527; <em>Richard F. Kline, Inc. </em>at 274, 885 A.2d 381. The owner\u2019s nonpayment, therefore, does not excuse the contractor from performing as promised under its contract with the subcontractor. In contrast to a pay-when-paid provision, a pay-if-paid provision is, by definition, a clear and unambiguous condition precedent to payment. By signing a contract that contains a pay-if-paid provision, the subcontractor takes the risk that the owner\u2019s nonpayment will discharge the contractor\u2019s duty to pay the subcontractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-6\">{\u00b6 18} Here, the parties\u2019 contracts contain two contractual provisions that Triad claims qualify as pay-if-paid provisions: sections 12.5 and 13.4.3. We will deal with section 13.4.3 first. That section, which the parties themselves drafted and added to the AIA form agreement, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b830-7\">The Consultant shall be paid for their services under this Agreement within ten (10) working days after receipt by the Architect from the Owner of payment for the services performed by the Consultant on behalf of their Part of the Project.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b830-8\">Contrary to Triad\u2019s argument, this provision is a prototypical pay-when-paid provision. See, e.g., <em>Chapman Excavating Co. </em>at \u00b6 4, 34 (holding that contractual language requiring \u201c[p]artial payments of the Subcontract Sum shall be made within ten (10) days after payment is received by [the general contractor] from Owner\u201d constituted a pay-when-paid provision); <em>R.N. Robinson &amp; Son, Inc. </em>at 885, 887 (holding that contractual language requiring \u201c[p]ayment to [the subcontractor] will be made at a reasonable time after receipt of payment from the Owner; approximately 10 working days\u201d was a pay-when-paid provision); <em>G.E.L. Recycling, Inc. </em>at 432, 434 (holding that contractual language stating \u201c[p]ayments will be made for the value of the work installed each week within 7 business days after receipt of payment from the owner\u201d was a pay-when-paid provision).</p>\n<p id=\"b831-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>{\u00b6 19} Section 12.5, however, presents a slightly closer question. That section, which is part of the AIA form agreement, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b831-4\">Payments to the Consultant shall be made promptly after the Architect is paid by the Owner under the Prime Agreement. The Architect shall exert reasonable and diligent efforts to collect prompt payment from the Owner. The Architect shall pay the Consultant in proportion to amounts received from the Owner which are attributable to the Consultant\u2019s services rendered.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ayn\">Triad focuses on the last sentence of this section and argues that it establishes a condition precedent to its duty to pay EMH &amp; T. According to Triad\u2019s interpretation of this sentence, only Triad\u2019s receipt of some payment from Centurion will trigger its obligation to pay EMH <em>&amp; </em>T a proportion of the amount received.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">{\u00b6 20} We find that the language of section 12.5 is not explicit enough to indicate that the parties intended to create a condition precedent. Section 12.5 does not expressly make payment from Centurion a condition precedent to payment of EMH &amp; T, address which party will bear the risk of Centurion\u2019s nonpayment, or require Triad to pay EMH &amp; T exclusively out of monies paid to Triad by Centurion. The last sentence of Section 12.5 directs Triad only on what to do upon payment from Centurion; it assumes that Triad will receive payment. The sentence, however, is silent as to the extent of Triad\u2019s obligation if Centurion fails to pay. We will not infer from this silence an intent to create a condition precedent, particularly when the condition precedent would result in a forfeiture of any compensation for EMH <em>&amp; </em>T\u2019s work. See <em>Wisznia v. Wilcox </em>(Tex.App. 1969), 438 S.W.2d 874, 876 (holding that a contractual provision stating that \u201c[t]he engineer shall be paid in the same proportionate manner as the architect is being paid by the [owner]\u201d was a paid-when-paid provision because it \u201cdoes not refer to the possible insolvency of [the owner], nor does it limit in any degree the liability of [the architect] for [the engineer\u2019s] fee. It deals with when and how payment will be made\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">{\u00b6 21} Although not necessary to our analysis, AIA commentary complements our conclusion that section 12.5 is a pay-when-paid, and not a pay-if-paid, provision. According to the AIA\u2019s Guide for Amendments to AIA Owner-Architect Agreements (Document B503-2007), \u201cAIA Standard Architect-Consultant agreements do not contain a pay-if-paid clause.\u201d The guide goes on to caution that \u201c[a] pay-if-paid clause must clearly establish the intent of the parties to shift the credit risk of the Owner\u2019s insolvency and should include the words \u2018condition precedent.\u2019 \u201d To modify the AIA form agreement between an architect and consultant to include a pay-if-paid provision, the guide recommends the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b831-7\">It is specifically understood and agreed that the payment to the Consultant is dependent, as a condition precedent, upon the Architect\u2019s receipt of payment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>from the Owner. Consultant acknowledges the risk of non-payment to the Architect by the Owner which may result in non-payment to the Consultant by the Architect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">In the case at bar, the parties did not supplement their contracts with this language or any other similar language.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-7\">{\u00b6 22} In a final effort to convince this court that the parties intended to be bound by a pay-if-paid provision, Triad points to the parties\u2019 spring 2007 negotiations regarding additional work that EMH <em>&amp; </em>T performed on the project that was the subject of the parties\u2019 January 22, 2007 contract. When EMH &amp; T proposed the additional work, it attached to its proposal a form entitled \u201cTerms and Conditions of Professional Service\u201d and stated that the form \u201cshall be considered as part of this proposal.\u201d Among numerous other terms, the form provided, \u201cClient is liable for timely payment of invoiced amounts without regard to whether Client has received financing, payments, or income from any source, including funds related to the project for which services were provided by EMHT.\u201d In the letter authorizing the additional work, Triad replied that the January 22, 2007 contract governed the additional work and \u201csupercede[d] any conflicting language in your attached proposal.\u201d From this exchange, Triad concludes that EMH &amp; T understood that each of the parties\u2019 contracts contained a pay-if-paid provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-8\">{\u00b6 23} As we stated above, whether a contractual provision is a condition precedent is a matter determined by the parties\u2019 intent, which a court ascertains from the language of the particular provision, the language of the entire agreement, and the subject matter of the agreement. <em>Adkins, </em>2009-Ohio-42, at \u00b6 32; <em>Hiatt, </em>2005-Ohio-6536, at \u00b6 23; <em>Kaufman, </em>159 Ohio App.3d 238, 2004-Ohio-6346, at \u00b6 29; <em>Moody, </em>2002-Ohio-6965, at \u00b6 9; <em>Kern, </em>149 Ohio App.3d 560, 2002-Ohio-5438, at \u00b621. The list does not include evidence extrinsic to the agreement. Consequently, we find the parties\u2019 negotiations irrelevant to whether the contracts contained a pay-if-paid provision that made payment to EMH &amp; T contingent upon payment from Centurion.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-9\">{\u00b6 24} Moreover, even if Triad\u2019s evidence was relevant, we find that it would be insufficient to convince reasonable minds that EMH &amp; T construed sections 12.5 and 13.4.3 as pay-if-paid provisions. Triad characterizes the spring 2007 negotiations as an attempt by EMH &amp; T to place a provision guaranteeing it payment in the parties\u2019 July 9, 2007 contract. Triad then reasons that EMH <em>&amp; </em>T would not have made this attempt if it truly believed that sections 12.5 and 13.4.3 protected its financial interests. Reasonable minds would find this interpretation of the evidence unpersuasive for two reasons. First, the parties were negotiating adding to the scope of work contemplated in the January 22, 2007 contract, not the wording of the terms for the July 9, 2007 contract. Second, during the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>negotiations, neither party mentioned section 12.5 or 13.4.3, nor did the parties discuss the payment term from the \u201cTerms and Conditions of Professional Service\u201d form. The term at issue was one of numerous terms contained in a two-column, single-spaced form, typed in eight-point font. Because EMH &amp; T did not single that term out or mention it in any way during the negotiations, reasonable minds could not find that its inclusion indicated anything about EMH <em>&amp; </em>T\u2019s understanding of section 12.5 or 13.4.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-4\">{\u00b6 25} As sections 12.5 and 13.4.3 are pay-when-paid provisions, Triad owed EMH &amp; T a duty to pay it within a reasonable time after the completion of its work. Courts allow a delay of payment for a reasonable time to \u201cafford[ ] [the contractor] the opportunity of procuring from the owner the funds necessary to pay the subcontractor.\u201d <em>Thos. J. Dyer Co., </em>303 F.2d at 661. Therefore, in order to be reasonable, the time period between the completion of the subcontractor\u2019s work and the date payment is due must extend long enough to give the contractor a sufficient opportunity to actively pursue collection of payment from the owner. <em>Avon Bros., Inc., </em>2000 WL 34241102, at *8. In most cases, by the time disputes involving pay-when-paid provisions reach the point of judicial resolution, years have passed since the subcontractor completed its work. Courts thus conclude that as a matter of law, a reasonable time has elapsed. See, e.g., <em>Chapman Excavating Co. </em>at \u00b6 9, 34 (holding that a reasonable time had elapsed as a matter of law when the contractor had not paid the subcontractor for approximately four years); <em>Lafayette Steel Erectors, Inc., </em>71 F.Supp.2d at 592 (holding that the contractor had exhausted its reasonable time when over three years had passed since the subcontractor had received its last payment); <em>Avon Bros., Inc., </em>2000 WL 34241102 at *8 (holding that a reasonable time \u201cha[d] long since passed\u201d when three years had elapsed without payment).</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">{\u00b6 26} Here, EMH <em>&amp; </em>T substantially performed all services set forth in the contracts by December 11, 2007. Consequently, EMH &amp; T has been waiting over three and one-half years for payment. Given this lengthy delay, we find that as a matter of law, Triad has had a sufficient opportunity to pursue payment from Centurion. Consequently, we conclude that Triad breached its contractual duty to pay EMH &amp; T within a reasonable time. The trial court thus erred in granting Triad summary judgment and denying EMH &amp; T summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">{\u00b6 27} Based upon the forgoing, we sustain EMH &amp; T\u2019s first and second assignments of error. We reverse the judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas, and we remand this matter to that court so that it may enter judgment consist with law and this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-7\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b833-8\">Sadler and French, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
