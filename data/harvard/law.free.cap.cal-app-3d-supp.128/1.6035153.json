Defendant carried the weapon for protection while operating the taxicab, and had no license to carry it. The court found defendant guilty on all counts, and imposed a probationary sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">Defendant appeals the conviction, asserting the same issue he presented to the trial court: that he was entitled to keep the pistol in his \u201cplace of business\u201d\u2014his taxicab\u2014under the provisions of Penal Code section 12031, subdivision (h). We agree with defendant\u2019s contention and reverse the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b878-7\">The charges involved in this case are part of the statutory scheme contained within a chapter of the Penal Code known as \u201cThe Dangerous Weapons\u2019 Control Law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b878-8\">\n<em>Penal Code Section 12025; Carrying a Concealed Pistol (Counts I and II).</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b878-9\">Subdivision (a) of Penal Code section 12025 states: <em>\u201cExcept as otherwise provided in this chapter, </em>any person who carries concealed within any vehicle which is under his control or direction any pistol ... is guilty of a misdemeanor .. ..\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b878-10\">Subdivision (b) of Penal Code section 12025 provides: \u201cAny person who carries concealed upon his person any pistol ... is guilty of a misdemeanor .... \u201d No exception is provided for this prohibition within the language of the section itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 5\">*Supp. 5</page-number>However, Penal Code section 12026 contains this general exception to all provisions of section 12025: \u201cSection 12025 shall not be construed to prohibit any citizen of the United States over the age of 18 years ... from owning, possessing, or keeping <em>within </em>his place of residence or <em>place of business </em>any pistol ... and no permit or license ... shall be required of him.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">\n<em>Penal Code Section 12031, Carrying a Loaded Pistol (Count III).</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b879-6\">Subdivision (a) of Penal Code section 12031 provides: \u201c(a) ... every person who carries a loaded firearm on his person or in a vehicle while in any public place or on any public street ... is guilty of a misdemeanor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b879-7\">Subdivisions (b), (c) and (d) contain exceptions to subdivision (a) which are not relevant here. Subdivisions (e) (f) and (g) contain a variety of provisions unrelated to our issue. Subdivision (h) contains this general exception: <em>\u201cNothing </em>in this section shall prevent <em>any person </em>engaged in <em>any lawful business, </em>... from having a loaded firearm <em>within such person\u2019s place of business, </em>...\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b879-8\">With respect to the charge in count II, Penal Code section 12025, subdivision (b), the offense of carrying a concealed weapon on his person, we can find no evidence in this record to support this charge. The sole evidence referred to the weapon being in the vehicle and not on his person. The conviction on count II must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-9\">As to counts I and III, we are presented with this question on appeal: Does the \u201cplace of business\u201d exception within Penal Code section 12026 and Penal Code Section 12031 subdivision (h) include a taxicab?</p>\n<p id=\"b879-10\">In any ordinary sense the taxicab here is as much a place of business as a store in a fixed location. This is where the cab driver worked and collected his fees. The driver had no other business location which the cab served to facilitate, such as a store\u2019s delivery truck, where the truck is not the location of the enterprise, but merely the means to facilitate the store\u2019s business.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-11\">The obvious purpose of the \u201cplace of business\u201d exception in these code sections is recognition of the need of business operators to protect their property.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 6\">*Supp. 6</page-number>The term \u201cplace of business\u201d has no set or established meaning in California case or code law.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Importing into these words the limitation of a fixed geographic location is unsupported in the law. In California\u2019s highly mobile culture many business enterprises have no fixed geographic location. Even such staid institutions as banks often use mobile facilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-4\">A claim that our interpretation of the meaning of these statutes would present endless problems to law enforcement or grossly proliferate public possession of guns because of California\u2019s many and varied mobile places of business, ought to properly be addressed to the Legislature. While we, as citizens, deplore the ominous growth in handgun possession in our society, this deep concern is not the proper focus of judges duty-bound to ascertain what these laws mean and how they must be applied in a specific criminal case. Had the Legislature intended to limit the \u201cplace of business\u201d exception to fixed geographic locations, or had it intended to exclude vehicles from the compass of the words \u201cplace of business,\u201d it could easily have done so. We do not perceive that our function here is to pass a law making illegal conduct which we personally deplore.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">The Illinois case of <em>People </em>v. <em>Cosby </em>(1969) 118 Ill.App.2d 169 [255 N.E.2d 54], illustrates how simply a law can be written to avoid our problem. There the court held that the possession of a gun in a taxicab was not authorized under an Illinois statute which only exempted carrying a weapon \u201cwhen on his land or in his own abode or <em>fixed place of business </em>....\u201d (Italics added, <em>id. </em>at p. 55.) The court, quite sensibly, held that a taxicab is not a \u201cfixed place of business.\u201d In California the Legislature did not choose to so limit the place of business exception. Subdivision (a) of Penal Code section 12025 prohibits carrying a concealed weapon in any vehicle \u201cexcept as otherwise provided.\u201d Subdivision (b) of the same law prohibits carrying the weapon concealed on the person. Yet Penal Code section 12026 provides that \u201cSection 12025 shall not be construed to prohibit any citizen ... from owning, possessing, or keeping within his ... place of business any pistol .... \u201d This same broad language is used in Penal Code section 12031, subdivision (a), which refers to carrying \u201cin a vehicle.\u201d However, subdivision (h) says \u201cnothing\u201d in section 12031 is to be construed to prevent having the weapon in a \u201cplace of business.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b881-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 7\">*Supp. 7</page-number>The only authorities directly on point are in other jurisdictions and go in both directions. For example, in <em>People </em>v. <em>Santiago </em>(1971) 74 Misc.2d 10 [343 N.Y.S.2d 805], the court held that \u201cplace of business\u201d included a taxicab, whereas in <em>People </em>v. <em>Brooks </em>(1978) 87 Mich.App. 515 [275 N.W.2d 26], the court held it did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\">The principle of statutory construction that code provisions must be \u201cconstrued according to the fair import of their terms, with a view to effect its [the code\u2019s] objects and to promote justice\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 4), is also of no particular help. Although the general purpose of the Weapons\u2019 Control Law is to control the threat to public safety in the indiscriminate possession and carryi\u00f1g about of concealed and loaded weapons, the express exception, to allow business persons to protect their property, must also be given effect. We cannot choose to give heed to one legislative purpose, so as to achieve the laudable social end of stronger gun control, and yet ignore the plain intent of a legislative purpose embodied in the exceptions. Furthermore, the legislative purpose which allows business people to possess weapons to protect their property is as important to taxicab operators as it is to business persons in fixed geographic locations. The possible danger to the public posed by cab drivers with guns is no more grave than that posed by armed retail store operators. We can perceive no sound or obvious reason which would warrant our reading into this law a distinction which it plainly does not now contain.</p>\n<p id=\"A1x\">Since Penal Code sections 12025 and 12031 prohibit the \u201ccarrying\u201d of a concealed or loaded pistol, and the exceptions permit \u201cowning, possessing, or keeping\u201d (Pen. Code \u00a7 12026). and the \u201chaving\u201d of the weapon (Pen. Code \u00a7 12031, subd. (h)) in a place of business\u2014the dissent argues that \u201ccarrying\u201d is always prohibited\u2014even in a place of business. The argument goes that since the cab is moving around, the cab driver is \u201ccarrying\u201d the weapon even when not on his person, and therefore such conduct would never fit the exception which limits one to \u201chaving\u201d the weapon. This passive-active verb distinction is discussed in <em>People </em>v. <em>Overturf </em>(1976) 64 Cal.App.3d Supp. 1, 6 [134 Cal.Rptr. 769], where this court held that \u201chaving\u201d and \u201ccarrying\u201d were not synonymous. We do not believe that the distinction is apt in the instant situation. The exceptions to the \u201ccarrying\u201d of a gun on a person or in a vehicle, are, as already noted, broadly phrased, and plainly do not exclude a vehicle within the contemplation of a \u201cplace of business.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b882-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 8\">*Supp. 8</page-number>We cannot ignore this well settled rule of construction: \u201c[A] defendant is ordinarily entitled to that construction most favorable to him.\u201d <em>(Bowland </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1976) 18 Cal.3d 479, 488 [134 Cal.Rptr. 630, 556 P.2d 1081], and see <em>People </em>v. <em>Lampasona </em>(1977) 71 Cal.App.3d 884, 887 [139 Cal.Rptr. 682].)</p>\n<p id=\"b882-4\">In reaching any interpretive conclusions we are obliged to construe these statutes, \u201cif their language permits, as to render them valid and constitutional rather than invalid and unconstitutional. ... \u201d <em>(Erlich </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1961) 55 Cal.2d 553, 558 [11 Cal.Rptr. 758, 360 P.2d 334].) Statutes which forbid acts in language so vague that people \u201c\u2018... of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and diEer as to its application, violates the first essential of due process of law.\u2019\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Barksdale </em>(1972) 8 Cal.3d 320, 327 [105 Cal.Rptr. 1, 503 P.2d 257].) Were we to hold in this case that Marotta is criminally responsible, significant issues of unconstitutionality for vagueness and uncertainty would arise. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Apodaca </em>(1978) 76 Cal.App.3d 479, 486 [142 Cal.Rptr. 830], the court made the point in this clear language:  \u201cIt is fundamental that all citizens of a free state must be informed as to what the state commands or forbids, and that no one should be required at peril of life, liberty or property to speculate as to the meaning of the state\u2019s penal statutes. <em>(Lanzetta </em>v. <em>New Jersey </em>(1939) 306 U.S. 451, 453...; <em>Findley </em>v. <em>Justice Court </em>(1976) 62 Cal.App.3d 566, 570 .. .); fairness alone requires that no man be held criminally responsible for conduct he could not reasonably understand to be proscribed <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Harriss </em>(1954) 347 U.S. 612, 617 ...). Accordingly, a statute which either forbids or requires the doing of an act in terms so vague that persons of common intelligence must guess at its meaning and could diEer as to its application, does not give fair notice as to the forbidden conduct and lacks an essential ingredient of due process of law. <em>(Conolly </em>v. <em>General Construction Co. </em>(1926) 269 U.S. 385, 391 ...; <em>People </em>v. <em>McCaughan </em>(1957) 49 Cal.2d 409, 414 ....)\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">Accordingly, the judgment of conviction is reversed with directions to the trial court to dismiss the charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-6\">Bernstein, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b878-11\">The complaint erroneously charged a violation of Vehicle Code section 12031. There is no such section. Obviously, the People meant to charge a violation of the Penal Code, since they set out in substance a charge of Penal Code section 12031. Defendant never raised the defect, and received adequate notice of the charge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b880-6\">Webster\u2019s Unabridged Dictionary, 3d edition, contains numerous meanings for the word \u201cplace\u201d: Among them are \u201can indefinite region or expanse\u201d; \u201ca building or locality used for a special purpose\u201d; and \u201cphysical surroundings.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b882-7\">JONES, Acting P. J., Dissenting.</author>\n<p id=\"Asl\">I dissent as to counts I and III. Although defendant is entitled to have the statutes involved here interpreted and applied to him as favorably as the circumstances will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 9\">*Supp. 9</page-number>permit, we are nevertheless required to construe penal statutes according to the fair import of their terms, with a view to effect their objectives and promote justice. <em>(Bowland </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1976) 18 Cal.3d 479, 487-488 [134 Cal.Rptr. 630, 556 P.2d 1081]. <em>People </em>v. <em>Heffner </em>(1977) 70 Cal.App.3d 643, 649 [139 Cal.Rptr. 45] also reminds this court that legislative enactments should be given a practical construction to meet the complexities of the social problems dealt with by the Legislature. Bearing these rules of statutory construction in mind, I am unwilling to apply the statutes as defendant requests. One of the main thrusts of title 2, chapter I of the Penal Code (The Dangerous Weapons\u2019 Control Law) is to restrict the carrying of loaded weapons and concealed weapons on the public streets. Any exceptions to this broad general purpose should be narrowly construed.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">Specific and enumerated exceptions to section 12031, subdivision (a) are listed in subdivision (b), allowing police officers, military personnel, guards, private investigators, etc. to carry loaded weapons on their persons and in their vehicles in public. Similar exceptions for carrying a concealed weapon are found in Penal Code section 12027. These enumerated exceptions do not include cab drivers or other \u201cnonsecurity\u201d persons. As for the \u201cplace of business\u201d exception in Penal Code sections 12026 and 12031, I believe that the Legislature had in mind businesses located in fixed geographical locations. While it is probably true enough, as the majority suggests, that this exception was designed to protect business property from robbers, it does not necessarily follow that such inherently \u201cmobile\u201d enterprises as trucks, buses and taxies were meant to be included within this exception. If so, the exception would, to a large extent, emasculate the thrust of the legislation. The legislative policy would be severely frustrated if cab drivers, truckers and ice cream vendors, for example, were entitled to carry loaded weapons concealed in their vehicles, given the large number of such \u201cbusinesses\u201d on the street.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-6\">Defendant\u2019s attempted reliance on <em>People </em>v. <em>Overturf </em>(1976) 64 Cal.App.3d Supp. 1 [134 Cal.Rptr. 769] is not persuasive. Defendant has cited certain language from that case wherein the court distinguishes \u201chaving\u201d a firearm in one\u2019s place of business (permissible) from \u201ccarrying\u201d such firearm (prohibited).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> But the court there was talking about an apartment house, not a vehicle. While a person can \u201chave\u201d a firearm <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 10\">*Supp. 10</page-number>at a building or other fixed location without \u201ccarrying\u201d it, the distinction made in <em>Overturf, </em>the same cannot be said for possession in a vehicle. Under the latter circumstance, the weapon is always being \u201ccarried\u201d in the accepted dictionary meaning of conveying or transporting (see Webster\u2019s New Internat. Dict. (2d ed.) p. 412), except when the vehicle is stationary. The reasoning of <em>People </em>v. <em>Overturf supra, </em>is therefore actually contrary to defendant\u2019s contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-4\">For the same reason, I do not consider the cases cited by defendant from other jurisdictions to be helpful in interpreting the statute before us. In each of those cases the very act prohibited was exempted where it occurred in the place of business. Penal Code sections 12025, subdivision (a) and 12031, subdivision (a), on the other hand, prohibit <em>carrying </em>a weapon, although permitting <em>possession only </em>at certain places. The distinction is crucial, in my opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-5\">The judgment should be affirmed, as to counts I and III.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b883-7\">At first glance one might wonder what purpose could be served in allowing a person to have a loaded weapon within his place of business or at his place of residence, if he is forbidden from carrying it. Section 12031, subdivisions (j) and (k) clarify this appar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 10\">*Supp. 10</page-number>ent inconsistency, however, by exempting the carrying of a loaded firearm where it appears reasonably necessary for the protection of person or property from immediate danger, or while attempting to make a lawful arrest. The statutory scheme of permissible carrying, otherwise expressly prohibited by Penal Code section 12031, subdivision (a), is thus made clear. <em>People </em>v. <em>Overturf, supra, </em>also recognizes this distinction.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-7\">Likewise, Penal Code section 12025 prohibits the carrying of a concealed firearm within a vehicle (subd. (a) or on one\u2019s person (subd. (b)). Penal Code section 12026, on the other hand, provides an exemption, not for <em>carrying </em>a concealable firearm, but only for \u201cowning, possessing or keeping\u201d such a firearm within one\u2019s residence or place of business. If the Legislature had intended to exempt the <em>carrying </em>of concealed firearms in such places, it could have so provided in much simpler language.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
