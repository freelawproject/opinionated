I attended as a witness in December, 1800. Mr. Bishop asked me if I had\" not better make up with Oneal. I told him I did not know as I am tending court. He said if you will go home, I will give you $5 and clear you of all charges. A man was present who I called as a witness, <em>viz </em>John Wilds. I went out, said I did not know if I could leave court, but took the $5 from him. He asked me if I could leave Dover that night. I said I could not leave town till morning. Bishop offered or requested myself and wife to go to his house; he would show me the way and should be well entertained, and go home next morning.

I understood Oneal and Conner were to leave their accounts to be settled by Bishop and Bailey, believe Oneal let Bishop have part of the money he paid Conner.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b271-5\">\n<em>Rodney.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A-D\">(Read the receipt.)

Conner agreed to take $5, had not as much money and borrowed the residue of Bishop, paid him, and Bishop wrote a receipt for him. Conner told me since that Bishop did not give me [Conner] the money as a bribe but offered me [Conner] $5 as such before that time.
