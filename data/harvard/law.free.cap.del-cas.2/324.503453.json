Ann LeCompte seised in fee of land in Little Creek Hundred, February 5,1783, made her will and devised as follows, \u201cI give to my son William Moore three tracts of land (naming them) in fee, provided my son William Moore pay unto my son Samuel Moore the sum of \u00a3200 specie, when he the said Samuel shall come to the age of 21 years, or procure him the said Samuel as much land as shall be judged the full value of said money to be judged by three sufficient freeholders at that time; but if my son Samuel shall die without lawful issue before he comes to the aforesaid age, then my son William Moore to pay one half of the aforesaid sum to my son Thomas Moore.\u201d Will proved at Sussex County.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b351-9\">William Moore, devisee, became seised of land by the will. October 27, 1795, William Moore bound himself by bond to convey the said three tracts of lands to Solomon Moore in fee. William Moore died without making deed. November 21, 1799, Outer-bridge Horsey and Thomas Robertson, administrators of William Moore, by order of Court of Common Pleas made a deed to Solomon Moore, in compliance with said bond. November 12, 1804, Solomon Moore sold to Thomas Rider one of the tracts of land aforesaid called \u201cKinkin\u2019s Folly,\u201d containing 49 acres and \u201cStilley\u2019s Cost,\u201d another of said tracts containing 66]4 acres. Same day, deed of bargain and sale by Solomon Moore to Thomas Rider for said tracts of land (no consideration stated) subject to the lien. December 27, 1799, Solomon Moore by deed [of] bargain and sale sold the other tract called \u201cCalloway\u2019s Delight\u201d to Jacob Marine in fee simple (125 acres in this tract). Samuel Moore died before he arrived to age of 21 years and before the death of the testatrix Ann LeCompte. Thomas Moore also died intestate, leaving his children and heirs as aforesaid about five years after the death of Ann LeCompte, and about 1797 William Moore died in Cecil County in Maryland.

They have understood and believe Ann LeCompte was seised, made her will, which was proved; they refer to will for devises and bequests. Deny that devise created liens on land devised to William Moore. William Moore contracted with Solomon Moore for sale of land in fee called Kinkin\u2019s Folly and Stilley\u2019s Cost, and a part of Calloway\u2019s Delight. William Moore died before he made deed. Horsey and Robertson made the deed to Solomon Moore. Solomon Moore sold to Thomas Rider the tracts. of land, Kinkin\u2019s Folly and Sfilley\u2019s Cost, to Jacob Marine, part of Calloway\u2019s Delight. Defendants [deny] that conveyance was subject to any trust lien or encumbrance as set up by the bill-. Thomas Rider says that when he contracted with Solomon Moore for said land, and when the deed was executed by Solomon Moore to him, he had not any knowledge or notion of any trust lien or incumbrance under the will of the said Ann LeCompte, but he was a bona fide purchaser for valuable consideration without notice. Jacob Marine, when he contracted and when deed made, had no notice and was bona fide purchaser for valuable considera^ tian without notice.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b352-8\">Defendants do not know when Samuel Moore died, or whether he died without heirs, and know nothing about them; refer to proof. William Moore, devisee, was in easy circumstances; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>Thomas Moore, his brother, was in needy circumstances. Presumably this claim was satisfied. Letters of administration on estate of William Moore were granted to Thomas Robertson, O. Horsey, and Moore\u2019s widow in Cecil County.

That William Moore in his life sold the several tracts of land for valuable consideration. Died intestate in Cecil County before he had perfected the title of the purchaser. Thomas Robertson, Jr., and this defendant made deed to Solomon Moore as representatives of William Moore by order of court. Solomon Moore sold to Rider and Marine. Defendant knew not William Moore\u2019s title to the land, but he was in possession of, and occupied, and was ostensible owner of the said tracts of land several years before the death of Ann LeCompte, and so continued till he sold to Solomon Moore. That Ann LeCompte never lived on, or occupied or claimed said land to knowledge of this defendant. That she was married before the recollection of this defendant, and in 1783 when she made her will was a <em>feme covert </em>and resided in Dorchester County and was the wife of John LeCompte, and died a <em>feme covert, </em>wife of said John LeCompte. William Moore died January, 1797. That his brother died Summer or Fall same year, very poor, left his family destitute.

He says he never heard of this legacy till the bill was filed; and if he never heard of it how could he know of its payment! Thomas Moore died in 1797, will proved 1792, his only five years, and yet they talk of its being paid by presumption. Thomas Moore died in 1797, no administration until 1815; and no person since his death could receive it. William Moore removed in 1793 or 1794, a year or two after the will was proved.

He says Ann LeCompte was seised in fee, devised the land, and charged it with this legacy. First, was she seised in fee? Second, did she or could she make a will to bind this estate, to transfer it to devisee, or charge the land with a legacy? The counsel has not said that a married woman could make a will. The marriage contract gave her no power to make a will, if there were any such marriage contract. But there is no proof of marriage contract. Counsel has not even argued or relied on it. Then simple whether <em>feme covert, </em>and dying also <em>feme covert </em>can make a will. Pow.Dev. 142. First Statute of Wills 32 Hen. 8. [By] Statute of Wills, married woman (so the Statute construed) did not include a married woman to devise; none other but such as could alienate land by other conveyance were meant by this Statute. The married woman was disabled, and was not included. 34 Hen. 8, c. 14, explains the Statute, 32 Hen. 8, and excludes married women. She cannot make a will to pass lands. The claim is against Rider and Marine, who are strangers, purchasers for fair and valuable consideration, and without notice, who never heard of will. Presumption against any notice of will. More likely purchasers knew of Mrs. LeCompte\u2019s coverture, than that she had made a will. A knowledge that she died a married woman would prevent them from hunting for a will. Pow.Dev. 162. As to personal estate, whether it will pass will depend on assent of husband. Power reserved in deed of settlement for wife to make will. This is by the deed of settlement. The <em>feme sole </em>acts under power reserved in the deed of settlement, and is the deed of alienation. Pow.Dev. 166. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>Husband cannot give wife power to make will. 2 Ves. 192, <em>Peacock </em>v. <em>Monk. </em>Pow.Dev. 166, 167. Wife may dispose of personal estate by agreement of husband; but not so as to real estate. 2 Ves. 191.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b358-5\">As to Negroes and personal estate being disposed of by will, that depended on the husband, but by law she cannot make a will of real estate even with the consent of the husband. As to election, this is sound doctrine; but they do not apply [it]. Here the instrument cannot pass, or charge the land. Again, as to declaring us trustees for complainant, the will, be it what it may, never gave any land to Thomas. Whatever it designed as to Thomas it is clear it was not land. And this land never was given to Samuel. As to conditions precedent or subsequent, in neither case can we be affected. As to lapsed legacy; supposing legacy not lapsed, yet if estate did not vest, according to argument of the counsel, legacy cannot be claimed from us. As to purchasers without notice. Talb. 252, <em>Mansell v. Mansell. </em>Breach of trust by trustees, purchaser without notice. <em>Cestui que trust </em>cannot affect purchaser.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b358-6\">The heirs of Thomas Moore cannot be parties here. He, Thomas Moore, was not entitled to land; if anything can be claimed it is the administration. The administration is created after suit, and he cannot recover on a bill filed before he had a right to sue. This should be a clear and unexceptional claim. This money has been paid by purchase of Vaughan\u2019s land.

Her son, William Moore, entered into and had the possession of the land some years before her death, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>probably about the time of the date of the will. Samuel Moore died before he arrived at the age of twenty-one years and before Ann LeCompte, who died in 1791 or 1792, in the lifetime of her husband. William Moore died in January, 1797, and Thomas Moore in September, 1797. In May, 1789, before the death of Ann LeCompte, Thomas Moore purchased two tracts of land of Ephraim Vaughan, and, according to the testimony of Matthew Kinnikin, Thomas Moore told him that his brother William was to buy Vaughan\u2019s land for him, Thomas, and that the excess in the price of the land beyond what William owed him, Thomas, out of the estate of his mother, he, Thomas, was to pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">From all these circumstances, I am rather disposed to think that Thomas was paid these \u00a3200. This seems to have been a family arrangement made by the mother of William and Thomas, with the consent of her husband, which was partly, if not entirely, performed in her lifetime. William entered into the land in her lifetime; and if Kinnikin is to be believed, he satisfied Thomas in the purchase of Vaughan\u2019s land. That this was a kind of family settlement seems to be inferred from Thomas\u2019s telling Kinnikin that William was to pay for the land from the money he owed Thomas out of his mother\u2019s estate. At this time she was not dead, but William was in possession of the land, and therefore he might speak of a debt due to Thomas from her estate. The legacies bequeathed in this will, or some of them, were paid; the Negroes, for instance, to William Polk, her grandchild.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">It is probable that there is some truth in the recital in the patent of June 7, 1800, especially as Ann LeCompte, then Ann Moore, the mother of William, paid to John Stilley in 1772 only a nominal consideration for part of Calloway\u2019s Delight and for Kinnikin\u2019s Folly and Stilley\u2019s Costs; the whole exceeding two hundred acres.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">Before William Moore removed from Sussex County he was in easy circumstances, and Thomas was needy. The wants of one required the money; the other was able to pay and <em>most likely </em>did pay in the purchase of Vaughan\u2019s land. For these reasons, without saying a word about the length of time, or making any presumption of payment from that circumstance, the weight of evidence inclines in favor of the satisfaction of this legacy, if it may be so called; and therefore the bill must be dismissed,</p>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">Bill dismissed. Appeal taken.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
