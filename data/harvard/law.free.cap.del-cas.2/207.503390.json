Peake 99 referred to, where witness was in Calais, handwriting proved.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b233-18\"><em>Bayard, </em>for defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AhkS\">objected that it was not, upon the great <em>principle of the </em>common law, the best evidence. They might have taken a commission and obtained his deposition, and according to the case in Doug. 89, the court hesitated to admit the proof where witness was in India.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b234-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"Az6\">We consider this proof inadmissible, it not being the best evidence the nature of the case admits of. \u00a3102 claimed by plaintiff of defendant, by their statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\"><em>Clayton </em>moves for a nonsuit, because they have proved the cause of action to accrue three years (and even in 1793) before the action brought, and limitation in such case is a complete bar.
