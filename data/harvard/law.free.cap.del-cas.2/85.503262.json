Howel, Recorder of London. </em>For fining and committing the jury in the case of <em>Pennsylvania v. Meade </em>and imprisoning them, for acquitting them contrary to opinion of the court. Action brought (by plaintiff, one of the jurors) for false imprisonment. <em>Per curiam, </em>the bringing this action a greater offense than fining the jury. Admitted that where judges are acting as a court they are not liable to an action. 12 Mod. 386, <em>Grenville v.

Ld.Raym. 454. 3 Com.Dig. 502. 1 Body Laws 336, all bridges over deep waters etc. within the county shall be repaired at the public expense. As they only regulate the finances of the county, if they strike the money necessary for repairs they have done their duty, and are not to execute the repairs. Charge laid in the indictment is for not repairing the bridge. Also, I contend that the defendants are not named in the indictment personally. 12 Mod. 559, <em>Sutton the Marshal\u2019s Case. </em>A corporation is not indictable but the particular members are.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b113-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>Ridgely, Attorney General.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Abx\">Constitution, Art. 6, s. 1; judicial power or courts of record of this state therein mentioned, the Levy Court not among them. Delaware laws [impose] a power and injunction on the Levy Court to take care of such matters as were beneficial to the counties. There is no other power in the county to repair this bridge but the Levy Court. If they do not, it cannot be done. 2 Body Laws 91, 94, the overseers cannot by law repair it. The cases read by defendants\u2019 counsel do not apply. They all go to show that judges etc. are not liable for mistakes, not for neglect of duty. 2 Body Laws 287. The legislature does not consider the Levy Court as a Court of Record no more than they do the Recorder, and it might as well be said the Recorder was not liable for neglect. Ld.Raym. 467, a court of record judge etc. must have the power to examine, hear, convict, and punish. Levy Court have no power to compel payment of fines but they must be recovered before a justice. 2 Bl.R. 1141, in some causes, action will lie for exceeding their jurisdiction. Commissioners of bank have some, though a limited, judicial power and were liable if they exceeded it. [1] Dall. 8.

They do not possess the requisites of purchasing lands, etc. The Levy Court shall grant the money, and the Act, [1 Body Laws] 336, says bridges shall be repaired. 8 Mod. 326, if two justices had made an order to remove a poor person (so as to endanger <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>life) they would have been liable to an information for the abuse of their power. \u201cMay\u201d in the case of a public officer tantamount to \u201cshall.\u201d Skinn. 370.

This being the first attempt to indict the Levy Court is a good reason that it should not now be done. The bridges over Jones and Worries bridge now not passable. Why not then indict Levy Court of Kent? They have charged us with not repairing the bridge in the indictment. The charge should have been for not levying money for. that purpose.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b114-6\">\n<em>Miller.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A8P\">From the laws of the state the Levy Court are a court of record.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b113-7\"> Blanks in manuscript.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b114-7\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"AE8\">This indictment should be quashed. First, because from a view of and attention to the laws on this subject there does not appear to be an express injunction on the Levy Court to repair bridges over deep waters, but only that they should estimate and levy money for that purpose. And consequently an indictment should not be maintained by construction or implication. The Levy Court is not a court of record. The Act of 1793, if unconstitutional, is not to be taken notice of by this Court, unless it appears on the face of the law it was passed agreeably to the terms of the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-8\"><em>Quaere. </em>Whether indictment might not be sustained at common law (Rodney).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
