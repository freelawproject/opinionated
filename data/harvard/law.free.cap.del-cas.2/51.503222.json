Nancy belonged originally to my wife. In March 10, 1789,1 rented a farm of Mr. Thompson in Cecil County. Took her with us. Stayed two weeks. I told her if she was willing to stay five years she should be free. She chose to come into the state. I let her come in. She stayed five months. My wife came in to prevail on her to come home again. I then agreed to sell her in Delaware. Did sell her and her son David to James Hart for \u00a340. She would not return but went to Mr. Redden and then sold her to Almond. I married in 1788 to Miss Redden, my third wife. Hart had her two years before sheriff\u2019s sale, when she was sold to Mr. Loyd, who lives in Maryland. James Hart also lives in Maryland. I lived five years in Maryland.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b78-5\">\n<em>G.
