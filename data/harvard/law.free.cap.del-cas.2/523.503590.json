Therefore it was liable to debts etc., notwithstanding the testator ordered it to be paid to Peter Waples, for the law after it goes into the executor\u2019s hands, will seize it for debts. And the debts have consumed all the assets that went into the hands of the executor. 2 Fon.Eq. 397.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b550-8\">The Chancellor</author>\n<p id=\"AK2B\">said that this money never went into the hands of the executor to pay debts.

It never could be applied to debts.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-9\">Decree that the legacy be paid.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
