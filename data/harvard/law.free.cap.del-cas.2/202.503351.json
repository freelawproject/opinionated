It would therefore seem hard to destroy his right of suffrage, if the Constitution does not absolutely require it.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b229-5\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"AtA\">The Constitution [Art. 4] requires the payment of taxes within two years, and the Court have not power in this case to mold or bend the Constitution so as to relieve the defendant on this point. If, however, an elector should be left off by neglect, perhaps he might have his remedy against such officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">Verdict, not guilty, after jury were up several hours.
