The declaration or acknowledgment of Samuel Cloak that he was indebted to plaintiff for the amount of purchase money of a negro man, say $200, offered by plaintiffs and objected to by defendants [on the ground] that he being no party to the .suit, his acknowledgments could not be admitted. The Court affirmed the objection, except that his declarations might be given to repel anything contained in a deposition of said Cloak, if it should be admitted. Exception prayed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b235-13\">Abraham Pierce, Esq.

The Act is not a penal law in the sense they speak of it. If Bishop by himself or his agent conveyed Cloak out, he is answerable, and the master in a civil suit is answerable for his slave to the . amount of the slave. If a debt from Cloak to Shawn be proved, you may find to the amount of it, provided it appears to you Cloak was solvent to that amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-11\">Verdict for plaintiff \u00a378.10.0.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
