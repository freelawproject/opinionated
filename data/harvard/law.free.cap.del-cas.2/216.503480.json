Stewart and Dale were discharged by Justice Tatlow. Another, Justice [-] <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> called upon him, got the warrant, put it into L\u2019s hands; [plaintiff] was arrested in Wilmington at night, but upon calling upon the defendant he made out a new warrant, put it into the Constable of Wilmington\u2019s hands. Plaintiff was brought before defendant.

At court time at New Castle, I mentioned at Mr. Frazer\u2019s that Thomas Chatten told me plaintiff was to be a second. Defendant qualified me, and I told him as above. I stated that Chatten was apt to lie. Was examined only once by defendant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b243-12\">Cross-examined. I objected to the deposition but signed it. Chatten was making clothes for Dr. Dale, said morning clothes or some such thing, was going to be second to a duel, was to have them done that day.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b243-13\">John Timmerman, sworn. I received a warrant to arrest plaintiff by Hamilton\u2019s warrant. I arrested him in the court house. Captain Gibbs and Frank Haughey went with him to J. Tatlow, who discharged him because he said the day was past. John Reynolds, Esq., afterwards put the warrant in my hands for me to go and arrest plaintiff at Wilmington. Found him at Tilton\u2019s, he said he had been discharged once on that warrant, etc. I went and told defendant, he then issued another, on which about 9 o\u2019clock could find him, and returned the warrant, came home.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b243-14\">Cross-examined. Mr. Reynolds nor Hamilton did not appear to have any other object in view but to prevent the duel. Hunted for Stewart to arrest him but he was in bed sick.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b244-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>Joseph Tatlow, Esq. On December 18, 1801, Stewart, Gibbs, Dale, Haughey, Tilton, etc. brought Hamilton\u2019s warrant of the-15th or 16th. I thought the warrant defective and concluded. I had nothing to do with it etc. and discharged them; was no prosecutor indorsed. Gibbs and Haughey were offered as sureties. About four, Justice Reynolds came and got the warrant with Timmerman. If they had come before me, and the day had been stated as of the 19th, and come on the 18th, I should have bound them over, and if they did not comply I should have-committed them. I issued one or two warrants in similar cases.. 1 have altered summons in debt.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b244-5\">Richard Moylan, sworn. Defendant gave me the warrant,, told me he would be found at Brinton\u2019s. I waited till he camera, arrested him and went by Tilton\u2019s and after to defendant\u2019s.. Hamilton told him the representative of Jameson\u2019s having made oath that day was a mistake, and took the pen, but don\u2019t know whether he altered it or not. Plaintiff, refusing to give security, was committed to me. Plaintiff said he looked upon it as: the height of federal persecution and would not give security.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b244-6\">Cross-examined. I did not keep Dale in custody that night. I would have been his surety. He said he did not want it.

Importance of the liberty of the subject. Although he be a justice of the peace, he is no longer warranted by his commission than the letter of the law warrants or bears him out. Where he acts judicially, he is not liable for error in judgment; I admit not so in his ministerial capacity which I contend is this case. 2 Hawk.P.C. 136. If he grant a warrant without probable cause, maliciously, and groundlessly, he is liable etc., though no man is liable for an action for what he does as a judge. For a vague, idle, lying suspicion, the justice illegally, unjustly and arbitrarily arrested Dr. Dale. One warrant, the 16th, and warrant of 18th issued on the old oath of the 16th on which plaintiff was arrested. It was the pride of Dale that he could get surety but he spurned it especially on a warrant in which no crime was charged, was confined in the den of thieves.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b245-4\"><em>Broom </em>for defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AL2B\">Dalt.Just. 20, 264.
