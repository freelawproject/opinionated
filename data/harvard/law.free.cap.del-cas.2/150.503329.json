On Monday, September 9, Thomas Smith and myself, about 9 o\u2019clock, we left the store all safe. Next morning found the store broke open and floor covered with goods, and many gone. All those laid in the indictment, and I suppose five or six hundred dollars more was lost or gone, the window was broke open. Nobody lodged in the store. Had not seen Crocker there for two weeks before. Had been there two weeks before election and after was often in -the store. Did nothing for support. Said he came from Massachusetts. I found chintz etc. in father\u2019s parlor soon after he was taken, which was Thursday, was two weeks.

A horse of William Traverse\u2019s was stolen the night the store was broke. Eight days after on Wednesday at daybreak [I] went out. I saw a W. horse coming up from D. B. into F. I saw a man walking and one in the carriage. Crocker came ahead of it nearly to my porch. Was a hundred yards before it. I hailed, \u201cWhy travelling so early.\u201d He come up, shook hands, asked if I had not seen him in T. Lowber\u2019s store. <em>I</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>said, \u201cYes, I\u2019ll have you apprehended or examined.\u201d He said, \u201cYou shan\u2019t,\u201d and snatched away and ran. I called out to pursue. As I turned around saw Truston jump out of the carriage; was about thirty steps off. Crocker ran down the causeway. Negro boy pursued and was near taking him. He took to the cripple. We surrounded it for two hours, when the Negroes I sent in, found him. I called to them and they brought him out, was all over wet, had stripped his handker<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>chief and stockings off, said he neither knew the man, horse, or carriage or had seen him. Truston had been taken. I went and asked who was concerned and how he came to jump out. He said another man asked me to get up and ride in the carriage, and he ran another way. I asked him how he came to get asleep. He said it was not him but Crocker at Glasgow\u2019s. He acknowledged he watched the morning after the store was broke. The goods we found in the carriage was carried into my parlor. Some of them I knew to be T. Lowber\u2019s. The same horse and chair William Allander now has here.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b178-3\">Cross-examined. Crocker had a flag handkerchief drying.

The morning they were taken, [I] saw a carriage with white horse at Lowber\u2019s. The men were gone, and the goods were taken out of carriage; they had some of them and were carrying than in. Saw defendant Crocker brought out, was wet, went to White\u2019s garret Lowber told Truston he was at Glasgow\u2019s and went to sleep. He replied no, he did not. Crocker went to sleep, but he did not. Said he had been all night in a fodder. He got up and overtook a man in the carriage over the causeway. Was asked, and got up, and rode. The man ran off when they were stopped. Glasgow said Thursday (and Lowber said Wednesday). Defendants were there. On Friday last at prison door T. L. said Crocker had been a hundred or a thousand times behind his counter, had helped to unpack the goods and had never treated a man so well. P. L. said a Negro was seen on a grey horse next morning after store broke with some goods. Truston was asked to bear evidence against Crocker. He said he knew nothing, would rather take what the law would inflict than swear false.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b178-5\">Samuel White offered.

Presumptive evidence is: sometimes better than positive. The cases produced by counsel go upon the principle that the dead body was not found etc.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b177-12\"> Manuscript reads \u201cHe.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b180-14\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"AEfP\">The question for you to decide depends on the evidence, whether guilty or not. The fact should be proved, but positive proof alone is not necessary to convict. Presumptive' evidence, where there is a concurrence of circumstances convincing the jury, is sufficient. In civil cases a preponderance of evidence is sufficient for you to convict; in criminal, you should, have proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-15\">Verdict, guilty.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
