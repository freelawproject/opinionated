In 1790, July or August, Adam Hunter came to my house, to me. He lived in New Castle, said he pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>chased a negro boy of John W. Batson that formerly belonged to P. K., had taken him into Worster with some others to carry them home; the boy had taken his horse and escaped. He wanted me to give out I had purchased the boy of him, I refused. Some time after, I met Hunter on the road and he told me the boy was taken up at S. Kimmey\u2019s and he was going to take him home. I told had I known it before I would have liberated him. I saw him once with Negroes.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b103-5\">P. Kollock sworn. I sold a negro boy named Moses to John W. Batson. I saw Hunter before with three Negroes. He said he was going out of the state with them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b103-6\">John Evans. I saw Hunter going through Dagsbury with Moses. He stopped and went in to my house. J. Batson came over and said he would give him a letter to his father to return his money for the boy. Hunter seemed agreed, and Batson told him to go down and he, Hunter, started some time after.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b103-7\">John W. Batson sworn. I purchased this boy of P. Kollock, had him about a year, sent him down to my father. Some time after, I was at Dagsbury when Hunter and the boy was there. He asked me $20 more than he gave at first, but agreed to take what he gave, and sent Moses down to my father. I do believe Hunter got him again.
