I say an indictment may be joint, several, or joint and several. 4 Com.Dig. 391, Str. 921, indictment will not lie against several for some crimes, as perjury etc.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b150-5\"><em>Bayard </em>for State.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AIT\">Judgment of the Court is that each defendant shall pay fifteen dollars and the \u201ccosts of this prosecution\u201d and that each party shall pay separate costs as well as separate fines. Therefore the question is concluded by the judgment. The offense and punishment especially are several. Where a number collect to commit an offense, the crime- is greater than if an individual.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b150-6\"><em>Wilson </em>in conclusion.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ApQ\">The case read in circuit not law, being contradicted by Str. 921. If the bill had not been found, county must have paid separate costs.
