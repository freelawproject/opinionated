Ledger, page 24, account of Lois Poinset.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b387-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>\n<em>McLane.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AVxA\">First, repairs and improvements are not allowed. Second, carting wood and cutting, not credited, worth $1.50. Mistakes in accounts. Some no vouchers. Cash charges. Lois Poinset has a right to investigate this account. Nothing will bar her. If she can show a clear mistake, she can compel New-bold to account with her. No account was ever made with Lois Poinset. Since he rendered his account, he has charged new matter. He did not give her credit for the $701.90, though he has since entered it, there is no settled account.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b387-5\"><em>Vandyke </em>for defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AXGN\">Urich and Lois did unite on the farm. Out of the funds of the estate, he built a vessel. He is connected with the accounts. He builds a vessel. A part of the money secured by bond was for money advanced for building the vessel. They can only surcharge and falsify. As to hauling wood and quantity, that is settled and supposition of witnesses is not enough to question or unsettle the account. So as to clearing. Settlement did take place, which closed the case. Debt obtained by duress. 2 Pow.Con. 163, 164; bargains by duress, or oppressively made, may be confirmed by subsequent acts. Here there are three periods at which this act was confirmed: first, giving a bond in absence of Newbold; second, he gave a second bond, first being lost; third, he pays $500 of this bond.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b387-6\">\n<em>McLane.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A2ZK\">This case differs from the case of duress. On second bond duress ceases; the second bond given freely; it is party\u2019s voluntary act. Here bond was given on representation of party that a balance existed; that balance not existing, second bond is no better than the first! 1 Fon.Eq. 14, 15; Court of equity corrects errors and detects fraud in account. Stated 2 Atk. 119, 2 Atk. 112. Party may surcharge and falsify. The bill states many charges unjust and untrue. Charges accounts unfounded as follows: wheat, taxes, half price of cattle sold, act twice charged, cash paid, no credit for cows etc., and other instances. Here we have surcharged and falsified. We have specified the articles. Proof as to wood, Poinset authorized to cut and cart. As to improvements, Newbold\u2019s letters. Poinset removed. This is an error. No credit for improvements. No settlement with Thomas Poinset. He died, account unsettled. Balance against Thomas is carried to Lois. This account open until she left the farm. 2 Pow.Con. 196, an agreement may be set aside if the party misconceive.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b387-7\"><em>Vandyke </em>for defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AJXH\">They showed that T. Poinset was bound to keep accounts, and render them. Defendants could make no account but from the accounts of complainants and their intestate. The minutiae of the accounts do not rest with defendant. Plaintiff shows by his bill that there was some examina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>tian of the accounts prior to the execution of the bond. Balance claimed by Newbold was acquiesced in by complainant. Bond is given on the principle of a settlement. A settlement derived from the knowledge of each party. Each had a part of the accounts to keep. No fraud is alleged, no duress. They cannot question the account but on plain errors in the account, and plaintiff must satisfactorily prove the mistakes set out in his bill. They must specify the particular item. Divers cash items is not enough, they must lay their hands on the very charge or item.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b388-5\">The Chancellor.</author>\n<p id=\"AuX\">The complainant may surcharge and falsify, but the <em>onus probandi </em>rests on him. This <em>onus probandi </em>will not be discharged or performed by general surmise or conjecture of witnesses; there must be direct proof to satisfy the Court that he has either charged articles improperly or omitted credits to which the party is entitled. No such proof is here given. The improvements which it is alleged the complainants, or their father, T. Poinsett, made are not properly made out. There is Newbold\u2019s letter promising to pay for improvements, and Stephenson\u2019s testimony that Poinset cleared and grubbed about forty acres, and that this land was afterwards let to other persons. But the exact quantity of land cleared is not proved; but more especially the value. Was this clearing and grubbing worth one dollar or five or ten per acre? What was the nature of this clearing and grubbing? Besides, the Poinset\u2019s perfectly knew of this work, if it was done. They produced here Newbold\u2019s letter, and consequently had entire knowledge when the bond was given of everything touching this improvement. At no rate can I fix upon any value or quantity. Therefore the party here fails.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
