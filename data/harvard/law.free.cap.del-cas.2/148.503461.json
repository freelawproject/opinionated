About 1753 or 1754 Hugh Park called me to execute a warrant in the fork of St. Jones. I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>informed him there was no vacancy there. I was carried I think on the lands on the southeast side of Maskel\u2019s Choice, do not know whether Pelopons or Maskel\u2019s Choice joined or not, but was in the neighborhood. Housman\u2019s lands was the same of Pelopons. Do not know if vacant lands or not adjoining Housman etc. Park\u2019s warrant a located one. In surveying, it was my practice and that of others to take notice of boundaries, and if vacancy to note it. I was appointed surveyor in September 1749 and surveyed Pelopons same Fall.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b175-5\">Peter Miller sworn. 71 years of age. In 1743 Maskel Clark lived on the land, his dwelling on a hill near a marsh, showed where the house and barn was marked on plot by Cummings (forty or fifty acres) on the land claimed by plaintiffs. Road run between old and young Clark\u2019s land. H. Durb'ow had a house on the land. Stanton and Jones land joined. Stanton\u2019s was some distance from Pelopons.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b175-6\">Daniel Wright Newman. 63 years of age.

McCall\u2019s claim takes best part of Maskel\u2019s Choice, takes in the barn.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b175-8\"><em>Ridgely </em>for plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AnS\">The only question: whether this land was vacant before our survey was made, and limitation. They claim under Maskel\u2019s Choice, [where] according to their own survey, second course is N 418, agreeing to our location, and the survey of Pelopons by Mr. Killen, containing many courses, does not come down to it.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b175-9\">\n<em>Vandyke.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aybh\">Warrant to Park, 1750. Surveyed October, 1776. I contend after Declaration of Independence no survey could be made under the Penn\u2019s, and was illegal. A .period of twenty-six years had elapsed, when twenty years adverse possession would bar him. November 14, 1739, title of defendants under Maskel Clark\u2019s warrant commences. The location of defendants of this warrant same as plaintiff, but defendant says from the expression \u201cto include his dwelling\u201d is paramount to course and distance, also that it was bounded on the northwest by a tract originally called Flour Field, and now Pelopons. Rule in location: first, natural boundaries; second, course and distance; but as on the face of the warrant we are to go to Flour Field, course and distance must give way. Action brought to May, 1797. We also recovered in May, 1796; in 1784, assigned from Doctor Park to M. McCall. Bull.N.P. 232, verdict on same point and between same parties to have a persuasive effect. .</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b175-10\"><em>Rodney </em>for defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A3vn\">Hugh Park, his son, not Mark McCall, had possession. George McCall, administrator of his brother, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>obtained an order of the Orphans\u2019 Court and purchased. Miller' says road ran near the line between Maskel Clark and Flour Field. Plaintiff\u2019s title accrued in 1750, because a located warrant; therefore barred by limitation. 4 Term 310, when the Act. begins to run no circumstances will stop it. 2 Co.Inst. 115, the law favors possession.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b176-5\">\n<em>Ridgely.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AH-\">If the land is vacant, limitation \u201cwill not run against the State\u201d \u2014 opinion of the Court of Common Pleas on the former trial.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b176-6\"><em>G.

Cowp. 215, Lord Mansfield, limitation, from the length of time, a positive bar. Warrant was the inception of their title. Act of Assembly, [2 Del.Laws 1175,] protects those who made surveys after Declaration [of] Independence. Act provides for the obtaining patents on warrants granted before 1760. But I contend [it] does not apply to this case, because the warrant and survey of plaintiff was not accompanied by possession.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b176-7\">Chief Justice Booth.</author>\n<p id=\"AIZ\">Opinion in former trial, \u201cStatute cannot run if the land be vacant\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-8\"><em>Ridgely, </em>for plaintiff, in conclusion. Limitation could not run until plaintiff\u2019s title was so complete as to enable him to recover in ejectment, which was not until survey. [2] Del.Laws 1175, making surveys previous <em>to </em>1760 good etc. Flour Field, by their own papers, has the N. S. lines six hundred perches and straight.</p>\n<author id=\"b176-9\">Chief Justice Booth.</author>\n<p id=\"AFp\">In ejectment plaintiff must show you a title. Defendant\u2019s objection first, that Park\u2019s warrant was a located [one] and plaintiff is barred; but the Court are of a different opinion. If the land was vacant, the Statute will not run. As to location, you will decide from the evidence before you.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-10\">The jury retired and in about three-quarters of an hour brought in a verdict for the plaintiff.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
