She, the petitioner, did not act, though letters were nominally granted to her. 1 Cru.Dig. 179, that a devise to wife will not bar her of her dower unless so declared. John Ralston died before the Act of 1816.

He said that the partition made by the devisees of John Ralston, Esq., although she asquiesced in it, was not a bar to her recovery; and he referred to <em>Kennedy v. Nedrow et ux. et al., </em>1 Dall. 415, where the widow, a devisee, herself caused partition to be made, and nevertheless recovered her dower; and this he said was a much stronger case. Her acquiescence was no bar.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
