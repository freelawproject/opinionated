And after his death, to wit, on the 12 March, 1799, administration of all and singular the goods and chattels, rights and credits which were of the said Isaiah James, deceased, at the time of his death, was duly granted to the said Mary James, widow of the said Isaiah James, deceased, <em>prout </em>the record of the grant of said administration.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b691-5\">And upon the granting of said administration the said Mary James, widow, and Stephen Lewis as her surety, made and executed to the State of Delaware an administration bond by them respectively duly sealed with their seals and dates, the 12 March, 1799, <em>prout </em>the said bond and condition thereof. Afterwards, to wit, on the 17 November, 1800, the said Mary James, widow, administratrix as aforesaid, passed before Isaac Davis, Esq., the Register for the probate of wills, etc. an account of her administration, in which she charged herself with \u00a33324.2.1% being the amount of\u00bb the inventory of the goods and chattels, rights and credits of the said deceased that had come to her hands as such administratrix, and on which account there appears an unappropriated balance of \u00a32873.3.5%, <em>prout </em>the said account.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b691-6\">Afterward the said Mary James, widow, married Nathan Huff, and afterward, to wit, on the 26th day of April, 1802, the said Nathan Huff was duly appointed guardian of the aforesaid Mary James (child of said Isaiah James deceased, she the said Mary James, the child, then being an infant under the age of fourteen years) by the Orphans\u2019 Court in and for Kent County aforesaid, and gave bond with John Wood and Smith Fassett, his sureties, in the penalty of 10,000 dollars, <em>prout </em>.the record of said appointment and said bond remaining in said court.

And afterward, to wit, on the same day and year last aforesaid the said Nathan Huff passed before said Register a distributive account, by which there appears a distributive balance in favour of said Mary James, the child, of \u00a32657.0.2%, <em>prout </em>the said account.

Blackistone, Administrator of Ford, </em>and on the same ground, and was held. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>under consideration until December 1; the only difference between them being that in this, Huff, in right of his wife, had passed a distributive account, that is, an account stating or showing the distributive share of Mary, his wife, the widow of Isaiah James, the intestate, and the share of Mary, the child, in the sum of \u00a33986.14.3%, the clear personal estate of the said intestate, but he had not charged himself with the ward\u2019s share thereof, nor in any manner shown that he as her guardian retained the same for or on her account.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b693-5\">In the guardian account passed by him August 6, 1810, he charged the ward, from January 7, 1801, to June 11, 1810, with $3582.44, principal and interest for maintenance and education; and he credited her with $3356.49 for rents and profits of her real estate, and interest from January 15,1802 to June 11,1810. She was not credited in any part of said account with her share of the personal estate.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b691-7\"> At this point, <em>Ridgely\u2019s Notebook III, 532, </em>the account of this case is interrupted ; it is resumed at <em>541.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b693-6\">The opinion <em>of the </em>Court was delivered this day, December 1, by the Chancellor. He said that this case did not differ from <em>Crockett v. Blackistone, Administrator of Ford. </em>The only variation of circumstances was that here a distributive account had been passed, which was nothing more than putting on paper the amount which the widow and child respectively were entitled to in the surplusage of the intestate\u2019s personal estate. That this distribution on paper was not a payment, nor a retainer by Huff, nor a charge against him. It only showed that the estate had been settled by the Register. It certainly could be no proof of payment, nor of anything else than showing the amount each heir is entitled to; otherwise it would frequently do great wrong to unpaid heirs. Huff has not mentioned that the money was held or retained by him for his ward. And in the guardian account passed August 6, 1810, nothing but rents and profits are accounted for. It is evident that Huff at no time intended to charge himself with his ward\u2019s share of the personal estate, particularly as there is a balance stated to be due to him on the guardian account of $225.95, which is not even credited by any part of the balance due to his ward of the personal estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">Judgment reversed unanimously, and judgment rendered for . the plaintiff.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
