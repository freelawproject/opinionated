On the part of the defendant, it is contended and proved by one witness that Conlyn agreed to rent and pay to Spear. Plaintiffs prove that a contract was made by Conlyn to rent and pay one-half the rent to Miriam Blackshire, a tenant in common in said land, and that Spear had notice from her to pay half the rent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b223-12\"><em>Ridgely </em>offered to give in evidence that Miriam Blackshire was owner or tenant in common with defendant. Objected by <em>Fisher </em>that tenant could not in any shape whatever controvert the right of defendant to make distress.
