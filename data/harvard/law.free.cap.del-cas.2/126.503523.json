Have known this land upwards of thirty years. Alexander Craig, who married the Widow Hudson was then in possession. She was sister to Samuel Mann.

If the lines of plaintiff include the land in dispute, you must find for plaintiff. On the contrary, if they do not, the Act of Limitation must have its operation, and plaintiffs must prove the possession in them within twenty years or fail in their action.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
