I knew a mulatto woman called Pat Costen. Peter Dawson, and Samuel Tindal, a Bob, and myself were at Cullen\u2019s, fixed upon a night to take her away. Bob and me went and took her and carried her away to the end of Tin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>dal\u2019s Lane and there he, Tindal, took her. Don\u2019t know where they carried her. Bob had her for a sort of a wife and could persuade her anywhere. Near three years ago in River Hundred, it was summer time. The prisoner is the same person, would not tell me what he did with Pat. She seemed to be alarmed and hollered.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b196-5\">Joseph Copes, sworn. About the middle of June, 1799,1 went to Indian River, inquired where Dawson and Tindal were, went in search of them and Pat, to Snow Hill in Maryland, found her there in sheriff\u2019s possession. I have since seen her here. She was discharged by sheriff before I came away. Samuel Tindal after his return met me on the road. Requested me not to appear against him for taking her away. I believe Pat has never been in possession of any person as a slave. She was the reputed daughter of Paulina Costen.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b196-6\">Cross-examined. Lived fifteen or twenty years ago at Houston's Mill. Tindal lives fifteen miles from Maryland line, in Dags-by Hundred, I believe.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b196-7\">Caldwel Windsor. Has known Pat since 1790, has been acting as a free woman ever since, and hired about from place to place where she and her mother lived. Have known her reputed father and mother ever since 1790. They have both acted as free persons. She, Pat, is a middling bright yellow. Her mother never had a master that I knew.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b196-8\"><em>Mr. Cooper, </em>for defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A0M\">stated to jury their defense, etc.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b196-9\">Noah Short. Have no acquaintance with Pointer. At harvest heard Pointer say to Tindal, I never sold you mulatto in my life, it was to Dawson, and never saw him but once, before he took the girl to the end of the lane. Cross-examined.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b196-10\">Jessee Tindal. Went to Pointer, told him Dawson and Tindal said they should not take the Negro unless he brought her that evening. He swore they had bought her, and asked if they had the money. He said he\u2019d carry her out and let them have her, if they had the money, not otherwise. He brought her to Tindal\u2019s that night. He said Samuel got up, was a Negro in the kitchen shut up. Sam got his horse and went with Pointer to Dawson to see if they had the money. A few days after, Dawson and P. came to Samuel\u2019s house, and they paid Pointer about \u00a325 for the Negro. They drew a paper. Pointer signed and I signed as a witness to warrant and defend her from all other claims.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b196-11\">Cross-examined. Do not know who took her away, did not see her.
