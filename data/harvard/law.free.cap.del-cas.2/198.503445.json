She lent it to John Wallace until she wanted; she went after it and took Butler, the defendant, with her to bring it home. Plaintiff\u2019s wife did not object (only wished her to lend it to her a while longer) and they took it peaceably. Butler was to buy it if she would deliver it out of the house.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b224-14\">\n<em>Ridgely.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A5u\">Esp.N.P. 380.

Defendant might enter the house, demand the loom and (if not opposed) in a peaceable manner take it away if she had lent it; if it was not her property, defendant was a trespasser in aiding and assisting as a principal. So also if it was taken from the house in a forcible manner though her property.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-18\">Verdict for defendant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
