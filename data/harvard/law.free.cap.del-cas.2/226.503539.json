Lank, garnishee of Cornelius Lank.</p>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b253-3\">Thomas Johnson. When we went to sea, Cornelius Lank told me he left some money in M. Lank\u2019s hands (what is here said not legal evidence). I told this to M. Lank when we returned, he did not reply to it. Cornelius died in the West Indies. He laid out all his money in Philadelphia in clothing and board, which I believe was but $16 he received in advance.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b253-4\">Tab. Dorman. I knew C. Lank, was bom March 5, 1776. He went off in May, 1796 or preceding March, 1797.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b253-5\">Samuel Paynter. I was present when C. and M. Lank settled the balance in Mitchel\u2019s hands, was $30, and I lent the money to Mitchel and he paid Cornelius, and a short time (within a week) Mitchel repaid me. This was about two years past. He had been the season before in the shallop, and Fleetwood, the skipper, paid him, and Cornelius paid me what he owed me after he received this money from Mitchel. About 24 shillings rent was paid to Mitchel, as garnishee to Cornelius. Money was paid before the end of the court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b253-6\">Joseph Fleetwood. Cornelius gave Mitchel a receipt for $30. This was immediately after the trial. He went to Philadelphia three days after receiving this money. I gave him $6 per month and paid him.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b253-7\">Thomas Lank. I think I got \u00a326 or \u00a327 for my share of my father\u2019s land. Cornelius paid me his board himself. He was bound to William King, stayed about three months.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b253-8\">March 9, 1791. Guardian bond of M. Lank.
