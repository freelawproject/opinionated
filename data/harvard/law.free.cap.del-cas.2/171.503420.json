As to proprietary warrants or located warrants, of which ours is, [it] begins the inception of our title and is prior to plaintiffs\u2019. Survey between Ephraim and Charles Polk of 150 acres. Plaintiffs\u2019 title begins I contend in October, ours in February, 1756. Recital is binding only on parties not strangers.

The Court however would observe that special or located warrants takes effect immediately on the lands that are particularly described therein, and also that the plaintiff should', recover on the strength of his own title, and must prove himself in possession within twenty years, but defendant\u2019s possession to bar a recovery by plaintiff must be adverse. You have the evidence before you, and it is your duty to make such deductions, and conclusions from it, as you may think it deserves.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-11\">Verdict for plaintiff.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
