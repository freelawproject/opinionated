This order states the land to be subject to a legacy to his sisters. The conditions of sale make the land subject to this legacy and to Mrs. Summeril\u2019s legacy. Tussy, the purchaser under the administrators, signs condition of sale, dated August 13,1803, acknowledging the land to be subject to these legacies. November 5,1810, conditions of sale when this property was sold as property of John Bird, by the marshal of Delaware District, on a writ of execution sued out of the Circuit Court of the Delaware District. The conditions make the land subject, among other things, to the legacies payable to Mary Betson, and wife of Joseph Summeril. November 14,1810, James Bryan acknowledged that he purchased said land subject to the preceding conditions of sale. He purchased for $6000. . April 18, 1789, order of Jacob Cannon former husband of Mary Betson on Lucas Stidham to pay whatever sum of money is due to him from the settlement of the estate of his father-in-law to Peter Stidham, whose receipt should be a discharge.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b381-11\">Note. Alexander Harvey, in his deposition, says he saw Peter Stidham write this order and sign Jacob Cannon\u2019s name to it; and that it is all in the handwriting of Peter Stidham, except the acceptance, thus: \u201cAccepted Lucas Stidham\u201d which he says is in the handwriting of Lucas.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b381-12\">Mary Betson proves the books of account of her deceased husband, John Betson, on whose estate she administered; and also her. own books.

Her account when widow of Jacob Cannon, and John Betson\u2019s account against Lucas Stidham; hers beginning December 22, 1792, and Betson\u2019s beginning November 1795, and Betson\u2019s ending January 3, 1803, amount to \u00a392.12.3%. Betson and Stidham died about same time. This is read to show that Lucas Stidham was generally indebted to her, and not likely to have paid the legacy.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b382-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>Will of Peter Stidham, father of Mary Betson, who bequeathed the legacy dated March 3,1777.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b382-3\">Deed, Wardle and Bryan to Turnball.

The weight of it, in my mind, is against such presumption, and I think there is a stronger presumption against the payment than in favor of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">The land has been constantly bought subject to this legacy. William Stidham, the administrator of Lucas, at the time he sold the land of Lucas by order of the Orphans\u2019 Court, set up this legacy to frighten purchasers, that he might obtain the land at an under price. It does not follow, though, that, because his motive was wrong, the allegation was unfounded. However, it did not rest on him alone. All the family seemed to consider the legacy to be unpaid, and so all the purchases were [on that basis.] I can come to no absolute certainty, but the weight of the testimony is in favor of the claim; the presumption is in favor of it, without any matter or thing to rebut it that cannot admit of some explanation, not perhaps satisfactory, but possible.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">There must be a decree for complainant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
