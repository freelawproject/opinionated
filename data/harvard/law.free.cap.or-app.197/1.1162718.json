J.</author>\n<p id=\"b26-4\">Defendants in these consolidated cases petition for reconsideration, arguing that we erred in rejecting their legal arguments concerning the number of convictions that should have been entered on multiple counts of robbery. <em>State v. Davis/Hamilton, </em>194 Or App 382, 95 P3d 230 (2004). Defendant Hamilton also seeks reconsideration and asks this court to consider a supplemental assignment of error concerning the trial court\u2019s imposition of an upward departure sentence under the sentencing guidelines on his conviction for attempted assault in the first degree with a firearm. He asserts that the upward departure sentence was unconstitutional under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, under the rationale set forth in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 US _, 124 S Ct 2531, 159 L Ed 2d 403 (2004), and <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 US 466, 120 S Ct 2348, 147 L Ed 2d 435 (2000). As explained below, we reject defendants\u2019 arguments concerning the robbery convictions but conclude that defendant Hamilton is correct that the upward departure sentence is unconstitutional under <em>Blakely. </em>We therefore adhere to our prior opinion in part and modify it in part; we alter the disposition to affirm defendant Davis\u2019s convictions and sentences, but we affirm defendant Hamilton\u2019s convictions and remand for resentencing of defendant Hamilton.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-7\">As described in our previous opinion, these cases concern an incident in which defendants held up a bar, after which they were pursued by the police. <em>Davis/Hamilton, </em>194 Or App at 385-86. Defendant Hamilton shot at pursuing police officers and ultimately was convicted, based on that conduct, of attempted first-degree assault with a firearm. The trial court determined at sentencing that the presumptive sentence for that offense on the sentencing guidelines grid was 31 to 36 months, given the type of crime and defendant\u2019s criminal history score. Over defendant\u2019s objection that imposition of a departure sentence violated the rule of law announced in <em>Apprendi, </em>the court imposed an upward departure sentence of 72 months on the attempted first-degree assault with a firearm conviction based on a finding that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>defendant Hamilton was on supervision at the time of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-4\">On reconsideration, defendants assert that we erred in our analysis and disposition with respect to our affirmance of their multiple robbery convictions. With respect, the contentions that defendants advance on reconsideration are qualitatively different from those presented by defendants in their brief and at oral argument. Defendants are shifting ground.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Regardless of the propriety of that belated effort, <em>see </em>ORAP 6.25, we adhere to our original analysis as correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">Defendant Hamilton next asserts on reconsideration that the trial court erred in rejecting his argument that the upward departure sentence was unconstitutional. Defendant relies primarily on <em>Blakely, </em>in which the Supreme Court held unconstitutional an \u201cexceptional sentence\u201d imposed under Washington\u2019s sentencing guidelines on the ground that the enhanced sentence was imposed based on a factual finding made by the sentencing court rather than on the basis of facts found by the jury or admitted by the defendant. In <em>State v. Dilts, </em>337 Or 645, 103 P3d 95 (2004), the Oregon Supreme Court held that upward departure sentences, which are virtually identical to \u201cexceptional sentences\u201d under the Washington sentencing scheme, are inconsistent with the rule of law announced in <em>Blakely. See also State v. Sawatzky, </em>195 Or App 159, 96 P3d 1288 (2004) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b28-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>The state responds that defendant\u2019s departure sentence is constitutional because it falls within an exception enunciated by the Court in <em>Apprendi'. \u201cOther than the fact of a prior conviction, </em>any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Apprendi, </em>530 US at 490 (emphasis added). The state asserts that the trial court\u2019s finding that defendant committed attempted first-degree assault while on supervision is a \u201cfact of a prior conviction,\u201d and, thus, need not be submitted to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-4\">In <em>State v. Perez, </em>196 Or App 364, 102 P3d 705 (2004), we discussed the breadth of the \u201cfact of a prior conviction\u201d exception from <em>Apprendi. </em>We noted that the exception originated in <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 US 224, 118 S Ct 1219, 140 L Ed 350 (1998), and that the Court in <em>Apprendi </em>explained that the exception existed because of \u201cthe certainty that procedural safeguards attached to any \u2018fact\u2019 of prior conviction [.] \u201d <em>Apprendi, </em>530 US at 488. In <em>Perez, </em>we held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-5\">\u201c[T]he exception to the general rule <em>in Apprendi </em>hinges on the fact that a prior conviction already has been subjected to the rigors of jury determination and the \u2018reasonable doubt\u2019 standard of proof. An exception for the bare fact of a prior conviction is, in fact, entirely consistent with the general rule that \u2018any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-6\">\u201cThe same is not true of facts other than the bare fact of a prior conviction \u2014 even those related thereto. Here, for example, the allegation that defendant was on probation or parole when he committed the offenses of conviction has not been proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt, so the same \u2018procedural safeguards\u2019 had not attached to that \u2018fact\u2019 when he was sentenced.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b28-7\"><em>Perez, </em>196 Or App at 371-72.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-8\"><em>Perez </em>is controlling here. The state suggests that the sentence imposed for a prior conviction is encompassed in the \u201cfact\u201d of the prior conviction and, because sentencing (other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>than in capital cases) is not done by a jury in Oregon, consideration of facts pertaining to sentences for prior convictions do not intrude on any jury function. We reject that argument as unpersuasive. The crucial fact at issue is not whether the defendant received a sentence for a prior conviction or whether a jury imposed it, but whether defendant was on supervision at a particular point in time <em>after </em>that prior conviction had been entered. Thus, even if the state were correct that the \u201cfact\u201d of the prior conviction included the sentence imposed for that conviction \u2014 an issue we need not decide here \u2014 it would not encompass facts concerning when the defendant actually <em>served </em>either the prison term or the supervision term of that sentence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b29-4\">Reconsideration allowed; former opinion modified and adhered to as modified; defendant Davis\u2019s convictions and sentences affirmed; defendant Hamilton\u2019s convictions affirmed; defendant Hamilton\u2019s case remanded for resentencing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b27-6\"> For example, during oral argument, while appellate counsel asserted that threats directed against multiple bystanders to a single theft could not support multiple robbery convictions, counsel also acknowledged (correctly) that each of those threats could constitute a separate basis upon which to convict the defendant of the crime of robbery:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b27-7\">\u201cIn this situation, you show the robbery by showing the <em>theft </em>\u2014 ok, that\u2019s the basic point of the statute. You can show it either by saying that the person threatened \u2014 used immediate physical force upon <em>another person, any </em>other person, you can use any person to show it. The state could have used <em>any </em>of the people who were being threatened to produce the money, or * * * if the state\u2019s theory was that the defendants were frightening the owner of the bar into giving money by threatening his patrons, you could show that <em>a patron </em>was threatened \u2014 it would still only be one crime, it wouldn\u2019t make it two crimes, it would just show a different way of proving that the robbery was committed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b27-8\">That is precisely the position that our original opinion ascribed to defendants. <em>Davis/Hamilton, </em>194 Or App at 389-91.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
