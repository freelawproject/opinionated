Words, \u201c </em>Copulation.\u201d</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b186-8\">A person who commits any unnatural and lascivious act with another person can be convicted under R. L. c. 212, \u00a7 27. Copulation is the natural act of coition and is not within the statute, the word being used inaccurately in the opinion in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dill, </em>160 Mass. 536, 537.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b186-9\">Indictment found and returned in the county of Suffolk in August, 1907, with six counts under R. L. c. 212, \u00a7 27, each count charging the defendant with committing an unnatural and lascivious act with'a person named, the persons named in the several counts being girls from fourteen to about eleven years of age.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b186-10\">In the Superior Court the defendant was tried before Schofield, J. The jury returned a verdict of guilty; and the judge, being in doubt whether the acts described in the evidence constituted an offence under the statute or whether they should be dealt with at common law, reported the case for determination by this court. If the conviction could be sustained upon the evidence, the verdict was to stand; otherwise, the verdict was to be set aside and such further proceedings were to be had against the defendant as might be authorized by law.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b186-11\">The case was submitted on briefs.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b186-12\"><em>W. R. </em>Scharton, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b186-13\"><em>M. J. Dwyer, </em>Assistant District Attorney, for the Commonwealth.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b186-14\">Loring, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AyU\">The only argument put forward by the defendant is that although the act here complained of was an \u201cunnatural and lascivious act with another person \u201d it was not an act of copulation and that for that reason on the authority of what was stated <em>obiter </em>in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dill, </em>160 Mass. 636, 537, it is an act not within R. L. c. 212, \u00a7 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-15\">It is plain that St. 1887, c. 436, now R. L. c. 212, \u00a7 27, was intended to make criminal any and all unnatural and lascivious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>acts with another person. Copulation is the natural act of coition and is not within the statute. It is evident that the word \u201c copulation \u201d was not used accurately in the opinion in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Dill, 160 Mass. 536, 537.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">\n<em>Verdict to stand.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
