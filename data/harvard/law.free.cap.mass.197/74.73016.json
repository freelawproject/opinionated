One copy of the release was retained by the insurance company, and the other was delivered to the defendant. The plaintiff sought to establish the oral agreement relied on by introducing in evidence, both in his own testimony and in that of the agent, the conversation that occurred between him and (he agent of the insurance company before the release was signed. The plaintiff did not rely on or offer to prove any fraud in the procuring of the release by the agent. The conversation was excluded. <em>Held, </em>that the conversation properly was excluded because it would have tended to vary or contradict the instrument in writing ; and, <em>also, </em>that it was doubtful whether there was any evidence that would warrant a finding that the agent of the insurance company was an agent of the defendant.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b94-9\">Contract for breach of an alleged oral agreement by the defendant that, in consideration of the plaintiff\u2019s releasing him from liability on account of injuries received by the plaintiff while in his employ, he would pay a certain sum in cash, would pay the bill for medical attendance upon the plaintiff and would continue to employ the plaintiff as before. Writ in the Superior Court for the county of Norfolk dated May 23, 1906.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b94-10\">The defendant filed an offer of judgment in the sum of $25.75. At the trial, which was before Hardy, J., it appeared that the plaintiff was injured while in the employ of the defendant who did business under the- name, Boston Gear Works, and received medical attendance, and that the defendant had. a policy in the JEtna Life Insurance Company \u201c assuring him from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>liability on account of any accident \u201d in his place of business. The policy was not in evidence and, except as stated above, neither its terms nor the agreements between the parties nor the authority given by the defendant to the insurance company, were shown.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b95-5\">After the accident to the plaintiff, one Pierce, an \u201c adjuster and investigator \u201d of the insurance company, called upon the defendant and got the details of the accident and the address of the plaintiff, and then visited the plaintiff where, after a conversation, he gave the plaintiff a draft for $50 and the plaintiff signed in duplicate and delivered to him a release which was in evidence, and was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b95-6\">\u201cFor the sole consideration of the sum of $50 and doctor\u2019s bill not exceeding $25, this 15th day of February, 1906, received from Boston Gear Works, I do hereby acknowledge full satisfaction and discharge of all claims, accrued or to accrue in respect to all injuries or injurious results direct or indirect arising or to arise from an accident sustained by me on or about the 14th day of February, 1906, while in the employ of the above.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b95-7\">\u201c $75.00 James Budro [seal.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b95-8\">\u201c Witness, James Hazen Pierce,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b95-9\">address, 4 Liberty Square, Boston, Massachusetts.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b95-10\">One copy of this release was retained by the insurance company and the other was delivered to the defendant by Pierce.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b95-11\">The plaintiff testified in his own behalf and, in order to prove the agreement declared on in the declaration, was asked to state the conversation he had with Pierce before the release was signed. The testimony was excluded and the plaintiff excepted. The plaintiff sought to introduce in evidence the same conversation in the testimony of Pierce, but, although he was allowed to state that he did not remember having had any conversation with the plaintiff with regard to his doctor\u2019s bills or his future employment by the defendant, was not allowed to state what the conversation was, and the plaintiff excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b95-12\">Subject to exception by the plaintiff, the jury were directed to return a verdict in the amount of the defendant\u2019s offer.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b95-13\"><em>E. J. </em>Parher, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b95-14\"><em>W. 3. </em>Vincent, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b96-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>Morton, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A6g\">We think that the rulings were right. The evidence. which was offered tended to vary or contradict the written agreement, and was, therefore, rightly excluded. The release stated that the considerations recited were the \u201c sole consideration.\u201d Evidence of a consideration in addition to those contained in the release would have tended directly to contradict the express written agreement that the considerations named were the \u201c sole consideration.\u201d The cases on which the plaintiff relies, as deciding that an additional consideration or a separate and independent agreement supported by the same consideration as the written contract may be shown, do not apply. In those cases the contract did not appear to have been intended, as this was, as a complete statement of the whole agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">It also may well be doubted whether there was any evidence warranting a finding that Pierce was the agent of the defendant. But it is not necessary to pass upon that question.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
