The plaintiff testified on direct examination: \u201cI am sixty-five years of age ; on March 17 I was living in Dorchester; I came into town to see the parade ; after the parade I started to take a car; I strolled up the street, watching for the cars ; I was on Washington Street, nearly opposite No. 865 ; there was a crowd of people; the hole was open and I stepped into it with my right leg; my leg went down to my waist; two gentlemen came and helped me out; the hole was in the sidewalk, about two feet from the door of the store.\u201d On cross-examination, he testified: \u201c I was walking along slowly, and, when I got near the place where I was hurt, there was a coal team in the street, outside the gutter; I saw it several yards before I came near it; I couldn\u2019t say how many yards, \u2014 eight or ten, perhaps; there was a workman near it; he was in the gutter; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>he was shovelling coal; he was taking np coal in a shovel; he was facing toward, the building; I do not know what he did with the coal; I do not know how much coal there was there; the back of the wagon was toward the building; the wagon was empty; there was only a little coal that was scattered after the man unloaded the cart; the workman was standing in the street; he was about the length or half the length of his shovel from the curbstone; when I saw him standing there shovelling coal out of the gutter, I didn\u2019t look toward the building; I looked straight ahead of me; I didn\u2019t look down; I didn\u2019t see the hole; there was a crowd coming both ways; I couldn't tell how near the people were in front of me; .there may have been no one within two or three feet; this was between three and four o\u2019clock; it was a clear day; I have seen very few coal holes since I have been in Boston; they did not have coal holes in the sidewalk in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, where I lived until three years ago.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b548-5\">One Hall, called by the plaintiff, testified on direct examination : \u201c I keep a store, at 865 Washington Street, known as \u2018 Hall\u2019s Beehive \u2019; on the day of the accident I was in the store ; I did not see the accident; I saw Mr. Wakefield afterwards in the store; I bought the coal from the Boston Coal Company; I had been buying coal from them for two or three years; it was the Boston Coal Company\u2019s wagon and their driver; I had no arrangement or agreement with the coal company whereby I should furnish somebody to watch the open hole.\u201d On cross-examination, he testified, among other things, that all he did about the coal was to send an order to the Boston Coal Company ; he did not know who opened the coal hole; sometimes the coal hole was opened by the driver, sometimes by one of his employees. On redirect examination, he testified that his employee, one Howard, usually removed the stick underneath the coal hole cover, and the driver pried up the cover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b548-6\">One Keefe, called by the defendant, testified on direct examination : \u201c In 1904 I was driving for the Boston Coal Company, and on March 17th I was delivering coal at Hall\u2019s Beehive; I had ten bags for Hall\u2019s Beehive; it was stove coal; I unloaded my bags from the wagon on to the curbstone and waited for the parade to pass; after the parade passed by I went into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>the store and gave my tickets to the office; I said I had a half a ton of coal and they told me to put it in the coal hole; I went into the office in the store and then I went out and took up the coal hole cover; I used the shovel to cover the hole; I emptied the hags of coal into the hole, first removing the shovel and putting.it back after I had emptied each bag; I was picking up some loose pieces of coal in my hand; I turned around and saw a man holding on to his ankle.\u201d On cross-examination, he testified: \u201cI had delivered coal there before; it wasn\u2019t necessary for a man to tell me to put the coal in the coal hole, it was customary to say that. When I first arrived there I jumped off the team and took my tickets in and told them I had half a ton of coal in bags from the Boston, meaning the Boston Coal Company; I laid the tickets down and he says, put it in the coal hole, he didn\u2019t want me to carry it in the store, I suppose.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b549-5\">There was other testimony on both sides. At the close of the evidence the defendant asked the judge to give the following instructions:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b549-6\">1. On all the evidence the plaintiff cannot recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b549-7\">2. If the occupants of the store where the coal was being delivered had the right to direct or control the mode or manner of the delivery, then this action cannot be maintained.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b549-8\">3. If the occupants of the store, No. 865 Washington Street, had the right to direct or control the mode or manner of delivery of the coal, then I instruct you that the teamster would be the servant of the occupants so as to render them liable for injuries occasioned by his negligence or carelessness in the delivery of the coal, although at that time he was in the general employ of the Boston Coal Company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b549-9\">The judge refused to give these instructions, but instructed the jury that they must determine whether the driver was acting under the control and direction of Hall or under the control and direction of the Boston Coal Company. The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff in the sum of $1,500; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b549-10\">The case was submitted on briefs.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b549-11\"><em>JY.

Under the authority of these decisions, the plaintiff\u2019s conduct could have been found consistent with the ordinary care of prudent travellers. The volume of travel in both directions being large, if the plaintiff as he walked failed to see and a void,the hole into which he fell, although observing a coal team with the back of the wagon toward the building, with a workman shovelling scattered coal out of the gutter, the jury could say, that these facts failed to prove anything more than the exercise of the ordinary freedom of locomotion, which every traveller has the right to enjoy while using the public ways, without being held guilty of contributory negligence. <em>Hennessey </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>189 Mass. 583. The duty of the defendant, while using the coal hole as a means of delivering coal to its customer, to use proper precautions to protect pedestrians from personal injury, and that from the discharge of this duty it was not relieved by reason of a corresponding obligation on the part of the customer, has been fully defined in the recent case of <em>French </em>v. <em>Boston Coal Co. </em>195 Mass. 334, and no further exposition would be warranted. If during delivery, by reason of the conditions of travel the opening became dangerous, then, if left either wholly uncovered or insufficiently guarded by the teamster, this neglect furnished evidence of negligence. <em>French </em>v. <em>Boston Coal Co., ubi supra . </em>Unless the cover was removed the sale could not be perfected, for delivery included transferring the coal from the wagon to the purchaser\u2019s premises. The service of the teamster was entire, even if, in response to his inquiry, directions had been given to him by the purchaser to use the coal hole, and being within the scope of his employment, the defendant, as the- master, remained responsible for the negligent acts of its servant. <em>Driscoll </em>v. <em>Towle, </em>181 Mass. 416. <em>Oulighan </em>v. Butler, 189 Mass. 287, 290.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-3\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
