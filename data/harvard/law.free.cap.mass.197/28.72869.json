Schoules then showed him. After he had been at work as directed for a week, he was put to work at cleaning a carding machine which had a different appliance upon it, which, after the accident, he learned was a licker-in. This' appliance is described in the opinion. He discovered that he could not work as he had been directed to with the other machines, and returned to bench work, when Allen came to him and told him to go back to work on the machine. Schoules, who was passing by, thereupon instructed him in a new way to work, adapted to the machine with the new appliance, but did not warn him in any way of the dangers attending cleaning the machine with the licker-in on it. The licker-in was wrapped in paper and the plaintiff could not see that it had teeth. He had seen no such appliances around the mill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b49-5\">The plaintiff also testified that he did not know a man named Leigh, never had worked for him to his knowledge, never was told that he was going to work for him or that he was going to work for any one except the defendant, and that he had no knowledge of any kind that he was in any one else\u2019s employment. It was admitted that the defendant paid the plaintiff\u2019s wages, Allen, though present at the trial and sworn as a witness for the defendant, was not called to testify. The deposition of Schoules was read in which he stated that he had warned the plaintiff to keep his stick off the licker-in.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b50-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>At the close of the evidence, the presiding judge directed a verdict for the defendant, and the plaintiff excepted.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b50-4\">Other facts are stated in the opinion.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b50-5\"><em>C.

The question is whether there was any evidence warranting a verdict for the plaintiff. We think that there was.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-8\">The plaintiff was hired to work as a laborer for the defendant by one Allen, whose sole or principal duty, it could have been found, was that of superintendence. Allen set the plaintiff to work at first at cleaning pieces of machinery, and about a week later set him to work at clearing the cylinders of cards which were being set up in the mill by one Leigh under a contract between him and the defendant. This contract bound the defendant to furnish \u201c usual laborer\u2019s assistance \u201d in fitting up the cards. But there was nothing to show that the plaintiff knew, or at least the evidence would have warranted a finding that he did not know, that he was working for any one except the defendant and had never consented or contracted to work for Leigh. It is possible, perhaps, that his consent could have been implied from the nature of the work which he was hir\u00e9d by the defendant to do. But the question whether he was at the time of the accident in the employment of the defendant or of Leigh was one of fact to be determined by the jury upon all of the evidence. In order to constitute the plaintiff the servant of Leigh, there must have been such a change in his relations to the defendant that the defendant had ceased for the time being to have any direction over or control of him, and Leigh had become responsible for the discharge of those duties which a master owes to his servant in respect to matters affecting his safety. <em>Driscoll </em>v. Towle, 181 Mass. 416. <em>Coughlan </em>v. Cambridge, 166 Mass. 268. There was nothing in the contract between the defendant and Leigh necessarily inconsistent with the plaintiff\u2019s continuing in the defendant\u2019s employment. The defendant was to furnish laborers to assist Leigh in setting up the cards, but there was nothing in that arrangement which necessarily operated to transfer the laborers so furnished from the employment of the defendant to that of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>Leigh while they were so engaged. As already observed, the question, in whose employment the plaintiff was at the time of the accident, was one of fact for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\">There was also evidence, we think,' warranting a finding of due care on the part of the plaintiff and of negligence on the part of' the defendant in failing to warn or instruct him of the danger when he was set to work on the card on which he was injured. That card differed from the cards on which he had been working in having the \u201c licker-in,\u201d as it is termed, in position. This was a small cylinder covered with teeth and revolving in an opposite direction from that in which the main cylinder revolved, and was from one to two inches from the main cylinder. The cylinder had to be cleaned while in motion, and the method of cleaning it with the <em>\u201c </em>licker-in \u201d in position was different from that of cleaning it when the \u201c licker-in \u201d was not in position. The cylinder when in motion revolved towards the plaintiff. The \u201c licker-in \u201d was covered with paper and the plaintiff testified that he did not know what it was. In attempting to clean the cylinder as he had been instructed to do, the stick which the plaintiff was using slipped, and his hand went down between the \u201c licker-in \u201d and the cylinder, setting the \u201c licker-in \u201d in motion, causing the injuries complained of.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">There was evidence tending to show that the plaintiff was cleaning the cylinder in the manner in which he had been told to clean it, so far as any instruction at all had been given to him, and we do not see, therefore, how it could be ruled as matter of law that he was not in the exercise of due care. Nor do we see how it could be said as matter of law that he assumed the risk. According to his testimony he did not know or appreciate the danger, and, unless he did, he could not be said to have assumed it. How much weight his testimony was entitled to was, of course, for the jury to say. And it was also, we think, for the jury to say whether, taking all of the circumstances into account, the risk was an obvious one. Whether the risk was an obvious one would depend largely, it seems to us, on the degree of credibility to which, in the opinion of a jury, the plaintiff\u2019s statements in regard to his knowledge or ignorance respecting the \u201c lickerin \u201d might be entitled. If he knew what a \u201c licker-in \u201d was and how it operated, and that there was one in position on the card <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>on which he was working, then, we think, that the risk that, if the stick slipped, his hand might go down between the \u201c liekerin \u201d and the revolving cylinder was an obvious one. But, if he did not know these things, then we do not see how it could be said that the risk was an obvious one.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">The remaining question relates to the defendant\u2019s negligence. There was testimony tending to show that, when Allen set the plaintiff to work on the card on which he was injured, he gave him no warning or instructions as to the manner of doing the work or as to the danger. The only instructions which were or had been given to the plaintiff as to the machine on which he was injured were given to him by one Schoules, who, the testimony tended to show, was in the employ of Leigh, but to whom, the testimony also tended to show, Allen had delegated the duty, of instruction, and who thereby became, for that purpose, the servant of the defendant. The questions whether any instructions were needed, and, if so, whether those which were or had been given were sufficient, were for the jury and should have been submitted to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
