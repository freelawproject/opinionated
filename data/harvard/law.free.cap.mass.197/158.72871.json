Low, his father, and the defendant asked a witness for the plaintiff, \u201c Is n\u2019t it true that Mr. Low represented and stated to Julia Low that the accounts as stated there were true, .and were all the accounts-and all the funds of the estates in order to induce her to sign this note.\u201d The question was excluded by the presiding judge \u201cunder the form of pleadings,\u201d and the defendant excepted.
