The presiding judge ruled, \u201c What statements W. made, I shall exclude.\u201d <em>Held, </em>that the ruling was wrong, the evidence being competent, and that, in view of the terms of the ruling of the presiding judge, the plaintiff, in order to have this exception sustained, was not required to show that the witness could give W.\u2019s testimony with the necessary accuracy.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b184-11\">Contract upon an account annexed.

If you can find out from this witness that he has made any statements even to a man now dead, it is competent. What statements Wilkins made, I shall exclude.\u201d There was a verdict for the plaintiff, and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b185-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>The case was submitted on briefs.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b185-4\">P. <em>B.

And on this bill of exceptions (which is very meagre) we must assume that this was a material fact in support of the defendant\u2019s case. The defendant offered to prove this fact by asking the plaintiff on cross-examination, whether Wilkins had not so testified at the trial in the Municipal Court of the case then being tried. The defendant had previously proved by the plaintiff that Wilkins testified at the trial in the court below, and since then had died. This was excluded by the presiding judge on the ground that \u201c statements made by a witness subsequent to a bringing of a suit are not competent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">Had the competency of the testimony offered depended upon R. L. c. 175, \u00a7 66, the ruling would have been right. But the ground on which the evidence was competent was that it was the testimony of a witness who had testified in court on the same subject matter and had since died; as to which, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Richards, </em>18 Pick. 434; <em>Warren </em>v. <em>Nichols, </em>6 Met. 261; <em>Yale </em>v. <em>Comstock, </em>112 Mass. 267; <em>Costigan </em>v. <em>Lunt, </em>127 Mass. 354.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">The exclusion of this testimony in the case at bar cannot be supported now on the ground that no offer was made to show that the plaintiff could repeat Wilkins\u2019s testimony with the necessary accuracy, as to which see <em>Yale </em>v. <em>Comstock, </em>112 Mass. 267; <em>Warren </em>v. <em>Nichols, </em>6 Met. 261; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Richards, </em>18 Pick. 434. There was no occasion for the defendant to go into that detail when the presiding judge had ruled that no testimony given by W ilkins after the commencement of the action then on trial would be admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-9\">\n<em>Exceptions, sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
