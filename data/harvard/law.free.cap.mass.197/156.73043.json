Later the widow died and the heirs of the former owner conveyed to the petitioner\u2019s predecessor in title all the \u201c right, title, interest and estate . . . which was set off to \u201d the widow. Before this petition was filed, the house had been removed. The petitioner contended that the land was assigned to the widow as dower, and that, not having been conveyed by the deed of the administrator, it had come to him by deed of the heirs on the termination of the dower estate, while the respondent contended that only an easement in the land had been assigned, and that the land had come to him by the administrator\u2019s deed. <em>Held, </em>that the petition must be dismissed since, upon either contention, the estate was owned in severalty and not in common.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b176-12\">Petition for partition of land in Beverly, alleged by tbe petitioner to be held in common by her and the respondent, filed in the Superior Court for the county of Essex July 28, 1903.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b176-13\">There was a trial before Schofield, J., on an agreed statement of facts, the material portions of which are as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b176-14\">Both the petitioner and the respondent derived their titles <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>from one John Pickett, who died in 1821, seised of real estate which included a lot of land with a dwelling house upon it. An assignment of dower was made in 1822 to his widow, which, besides an interest in other real estate, included, as to the dwelling house and lot referred to, the whole of the lower part of the house, a small portion of the cellar and easements in other parts of the house and surrounding yard. Thereafter in the same year the administrator of the estate sold to Thomas L. Pickett, the respondent\u2019s predecessor in title, the dwelling house and lot, \u201c saving and reserving that part of said house and land that hath been set off to said deceased\u2019s widow as her dower in his real estate.\u201d The respondent claimed exactly what was conveyed by the administrator\u2019s deed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b177-5\">The widow died in 1847, and then the heirs of John Pickett joined in a deed to the petitioner\u2019s predecessor in title, conveying the <em>\u201c </em>right, title, interest and estate in and to all that portion of the real estate of the late John Pickett aforesaid which was set off to his widow, . . . together with all the privileges thereto belonging.\u201d The petitioner claimed exactly what was conveyed by this deed of the heirs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b177-6\">The petitioner and the respondent joined in selling the house, which was moved off from the premises, the proceeds of the sale being divided \u201c proportionately.\u201d This petition is only with regard to the land upon which the house had stood.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b177-7\">The presiding judge ruled that the assignment of dower gave to the widow an estate in severalty for life in the land under the house, leaving the reversion in the heirs; that the deed of the administrator conveyed the residue of the property which had not been set off; that the deed of the heirs, after the widow\u2019s life estate fell in, conveyed the fee simple in the portion of the property described in the assignment of dower to the petitioner\u2019s predecessor in title ; that \u201c the petitioner is not a tenant in common, but in severalty. She is entitled to the land on which the house stood. The court rules that she is not entitled to partition as prayed for, but may be entitled to a writ of entry or other remedy for possession.\u201d He therefore dismissed the petition and the petitioner appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b177-8\"><em>S. </em>Perley, for the petitioner.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b177-9\"><em>P.

If, as contended by the respondent, not the land, but only an easement therein, was included in the set-off, then the land passed to Thomas L. Pickett by the deed of the administrator of the estate given to him before the death of the widow, and by mesne conveyances has passed to the respondent who holds the same in severalty. Either way there is no land owned by the petitioner and respondent in common, and for that reason the petition must be dismissed. The rights of the petitioner, if any she has, must be settled in some other proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"A2E\">\n<em>Petition dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
