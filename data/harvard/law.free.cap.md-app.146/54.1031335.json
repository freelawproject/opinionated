We must decide whether test results indicating the presence of marijuana in a urine sample allegedly supplied by Pollock should have been excluded due to the failure of staff at Patuxent Institution (\u201cPatuxent\u201d) to strictly follow Patuxent\u2019s procedures for collecting and documenting urine specimens. After the Court of Appeals remanded for a decision on this question, the Circuit Court for Howard County held that the test results were properly admitted and considered by the Patuxent Institution Board of Review (the \u201cBoard\u201d), appellee, both in deciding to revoke Pollock\u2019s parole and in later deciding not to renew his expired parole order. We shall affirm the circuit court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">PACTS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS The Test</p>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">Pollock, who killed a cab driver during an argument, was incarcerated in the Maryland Division of Correction as inmate number 4695 on November 23, 1971. He is serving a life sentence with the possibility of parole for first degree murder, plus two years consecutive for escape.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-9\">In April 1980, Pollock was committed to Patuxent as a person eligible for Patuxent programs. He became eligible for parole in December 1985, and was paroled in September 1988. Pollock\u2019s most recent parole order was issued in June 1996, with an expiration date of May 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-10\">One condition of Pollock\u2019s parole was annual urinalysis testing to determine whether he was in compliance with the \u201cno drugs\u201d and \u201cobey all laws\u201d requirements of his parole order. On May 15, 1997, Pollock arrived at Patuxent to submit a urine sample. The specimen associated with Pollock tested positive for marijuana. According to Pollock, what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>happened during the collection and testing of this specimen requires exclusion of those test results.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">Sgt. A.P. Jones was on duty when Pollock arrived. Jones completed the required \u201cRequest for Urinalysis Test\u201d form, certifying that \u201cMiche\u00e1l [sic] Pollock\u201d had verified his identity by \u201cI.D. card.\u201d Jones certified, by signing the form, that Pollock had</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-6\">submitted a urine specimen in my presence in a specimen bottle labeled with the inmate\u2019s name and number and today\u2019s date, and thereafter the inmate handed me the bottle. I thereafter sealed the bottle with evidence tape, and maintained exclusive possession and control of the bottle until I transferred it from my possession and control as indicated below:....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-7\">CHAIN-OF-CUSTODY OF SPECIMEN:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-8\">From above-named inmate To APJones Date 5-15-97 Time 10:30 AM</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-9\">From AP Jones To Lock Refrigerator Date 5-15-97 Time 10:33 AM</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-10\">From Capt. L. Latham To P. Stuffey Date 5-15-97 Time 1:40 PM</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b82-11\">Apparently in an attempt to use Pollock\u2019s inmate number as the number identifying Pollock\u2019s urine specimen, Jones filled in the blank for \u201cnumber\u201d on that form with \u201c4697.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b82-12\">At the same time he obtained Pollock\u2019s sample, Jones also completed another required Patuxent form, entitled \u201cIncident Report.\u201d Jones completed the \u201cnature of incident\u201d blank with the following handwritten note:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-13\">On the above date and approx, time the above named inmate gave a urine sample for drug testing; The test was administered by this writer and observed by CO D[.] Taylor. The sample was secured in the locked refrigerator in the infirmary....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b82-14\">Jones also used number 4697 on that Incident Report.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-15\">A third form completed at the time Pollock submitted his urine sample, was entitled:</p>\n<p id=\"b83-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>Friends Medical Laboratory</p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\">Laboratory Testing Requisition Form</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">This form identified Patuxent as the \u201cCollection Site\u201d for \u201c7\u201d different specimens, one collected on May 8, another on May 10, and five on May 15, 1997. Listed under the \u201cSpecimen Identity\u201d column of this form were handwritten names of seven different inmates. Each name appeared in a separately numbered box. The first line in each box identified the inmate\u2019s name in manuscript with a corresponding inmate number. On the second line, appearing right below the manuscript name and inmate number, each inmate signed the form.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">\u201cMichael Pollock #4669\u201d is identified as the fourth specimen, dated \u201c5-15-97,\u201d and \u201ccollected by A.P. Jones &amp; D. Taylor.\u201d (Emphasis added.) In cursive, under his manuscript name and number, Michael Pollock signed his name and correctly identified himself as \u201c#4695.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The form indicates \u201cCapt. L. Latham\u201d \u201creleased\u201d the specimens to a courier from Friends Medical Laboratory (\u201cFriends\u201d) on \u201c5/15/97\u201d at \u201c1:35 pm.\u201d and authorized Friends to test the specimens.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">The next day, on May 16, 1997, Friends tested a urine sample received on \u201c05/15/97\u201d that it identified as belonging to \u201cClient: Pollock, Michael 4669.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The results of this test showed that the sample was positive for marijuana. Friends faxed a copy of the test results to Patux-ent on May 19,1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-8\">A parole revocation warrant was issued immediately. On May 20, Pollock surrendered and was returned to Patuxent. At a May 22 preliminary revocation hearing, Pollock denied using marijuana, but \u201cadmitted that he had been briefly in the presence of suspected marijuana smokers[.]\u201d The hearing officer found probable cause for charges that Pollock had violated the terms of his parole, and ordered a parole revocation hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>On May 23, at the request of Patuxent, Friends performed a \u201cconfirmation re-test,\u201d with the same results. The confirmation test report identified the \u201cclient\u201d from whom the sample was taken with the same typewritten \u201cPollock, Michael\u201d that appeared on the original test report, but without the incorrect typewritten inmate number \u201c4669.\u201d Instead, handwritten immediately beneath Pollock\u2019s name is the following notation: \u201c4695 Ref-P.\u201d (Emphasis added.) It is unclear whether the person who added the handwritten inmate number was someone at Friends or at Patuxent.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">Revocation And Non-Renewal</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">Pollock\u2019s parole revocation hearing began on June 19, 1997 and concluded on July 17, 1997. At the hearing, Pollock moved to dismiss the revocation proceedings because he had not received timely notice of the hearing pursuant to Patuxent Institution Regulation (\u201cPIR\u201d) 240-19.V.C. Additionally, Pollock moved to exclude the urinalysis reports on the ground that there were violations of the chain of custody procedures and documentation requirements established by Patuxent Institution Directive (\u201cPID\u201d) 110-18.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">The Board denied both motions. Based on the test results from Friends, it concluded that Pollock had used marijuana in violation of the terms of his parole. \u201c[D]ue to the seriousness of these violations,\u201d the Board ruled that Pollock was \u201cno longer eligible for Patuxent programs.\u201d As a result, Pollock was transferred to another correctional facility within the DOC to serve the remainder of his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-8\">In August 1997, Pollock appealed the Board\u2019s decision to the Circuit Court for Howard County. He argued that the Board violated its own rules by failing to provide timely notification of the revocation hearing and that the urinalysis test results were inadmissible because a chain of custody was never <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>established. Patuxent responded that the issues raised by Pollock were moot because Pollock\u2019s parole order had expired before the July 1997 parole revocation hearing, and, alternatively, that there was sufficient evidence to establish a chain of custody for Pollock\u2019s specimen.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\">On April 15, 1998, the circuit court reversed the Board\u2019s decision to revoke Pollock\u2019s parole, ruling that the Board was late in notifying Pollock of the revocation hearing. The circuit court, however, did not address whether the urinalysis results could be used against Pollock as grounds for revocation of his parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">As a result of this order, the Attorney General advised Patuxent that Pollock</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-6\">must be brought back to the Patuxent Institution and either (1) be declared a \u201cnon-eligible person\u201d based on facts other than the parole revocation (although the Board may consider the positive urinalysis that [led] to the revocation); or (2) return the inmate to parole as an eligible person; (3) reinstate the eligible person status, but factually determine that parole is not appropriate through the \u201cannual review\u201d process (rather than in conjunction with a parole revocation).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">Patuxent chose the third option. On May 8,1998, it advised Pollock that, during his appeal of the Board\u2019s revocation decision, \u201cyour annual review for parole status ... lapsed.\u201d Accordingly, an annual parole review hearing was scheduled for May 21, 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-8\">In response to this notice, on May 13, 1998, Pollock filed a <em>habeas corpus </em>petition in the Circuit Court for Howard County. Shortly thereafter, at the May 21 annual review hearing, the Board relied on the positive urinalysis results in deciding not to renew Pollock\u2019s parole. Noting \u201cthe legal implications of this case,\u201d the Board returned Pollock to Patuxent as \u201can Eligible Person,\u201d where he was \u201cput on [the] drug tier.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ap-dedup-0\">On June 2, 1998, the circuit court held a hearing on Pollock\u2019s <em>habeas </em>petition. A year later, on June 30, 1999, the circuit court denied <em>habeas </em>relief because Pollock\u2019s parole had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>expired, so there was \u201cno parole to which Pollock could be restored.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">Pollock appealed that decision to this Court, raising both constitutional and procedural arguments. We affirmed in an unreported decision that adopted the circuit court\u2019s rationale. <em>See Pollock v. Patuxent Inst. Bd. of Review, </em>No. 1657, Sept. Term 1998, 127 Md.App. 790 (filed June 14, 1999). The Court of Appeals granted <em>certiorari </em>to consider whether a Patuxent parolee has a constitutional right to remain on parole until the parole is revoked in accordance with a revocation proceeding that meets \u201cdue process\u201d standards. <em>See Pollock v. Patuxent Inst. Bd. of Review, </em>358 Md. 656, 666, 751 A.2d 496 (2000). The Court, however, ultimately declined to decide that question until all of the non-constitutional questions were resolved. <em>See id. </em>at 666-67, 751 A.2d 496. It vacated this Court\u2019s decision and remanded the <em>habeas </em>petition because Pollock had \u201cnever obtained judicial review of the use of the May 1997 report of urinalysis either as the basis for the original revocation or as the basis for the May 21, 1998 non-renewal on annual review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 668, 751 A.2d 496.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">On remand, by written order dated June 27, 2001, the circuit court found that the testimony and documents presented by. the Board</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-6\">constitute[ ] \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d in support of the conclusion that the sample submitted by Mr. Pollock contained marijuana in violation of his conditions of parole. The testimony and exhibits show directly, or support a reasonable inference, that all requirements of ... PID No. 110-18 concerning the taking, storage, transfer and testing of the sample were complied with, even if one page of the chain of custody [form] was not introduced as an exhibit. The content of that page and the compliance of that document with PID No. 110-18 was testified to by Sgt. A.P. Jones.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aqj\">The <em>habeas </em>court held that both the decision to revoke Pollock\u2019s parole and the decision not to renew it were \u201cfully justified\u201d by \u201cthe finding that Mr. Pollock\u2019s urine sample from May 15, 1997, contained marijuana in violation of his condi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>tions of parole.\u201d It is from this decision that Pollock now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">Pollock asserts that the Board\u2019s finding that the positive urine specimen was the same urine specimen collected from Pollock on May 15, 1997 was clearly erroneous because that fact \u201cwas never established with any reasonable degree of certainty[.]\u201d In addition, he argues that the decision to admit the test results at the revocation hearing and to rely on those results as grounds for revocation and non-renewal \u201cwas incorrect as a matter of law\u201d because PID 110-18, entitled \u201cUrinalysis Testing,\u201d \u201csets forth a <em>mandatory </em>procedural framework that must be followed when obtaining and testing a Patuxent inmate\u2019s urine for illicit drugs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">PID 110-18 does prescribe procedures for collecting and handling urine specimens received from Patuxent inmates.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The following portions of this directive are at issue in this case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-7\">2. Each request for a urinalysis test shall be documented by an Incident Report (Appendix A) and a Request for Urinalysis Test (Appendix D)....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-8\">4. The urine specimen shall be collected from the inmate as follows: ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-9\">c. Staff shall hand to the inmate the specimen bottle, <em>pre-labeled with the inmate\u2019s name, number, and date. This information shall be handwritten. The inmate shall be asked to acknowledge that information on the label is correct.... The bottle number shall be noted on the Incident Report Form (Appendix A).</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-10\">d. When the inmate has handed the filled bottle back to staff, staff shall ensure that the bottle is tightly capped, and then shall properly secure a piece of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>\u201cEvidence Tape\u201d over the cap and to the sides of the bottle....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-5\">f. The collection of the urine specimen ... shall be documented on the Incident Report.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-6\">g. The original copy of the Medical Laboratory Chain of Custody Form shall be retained until the specimens are picked up for testing. The original copy shall be signed by and released to the Medical Laboratory courier. <em>The duplicate copy shall be sent to the Major\u2019s Office.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-7\"><em>5. </em>The urine specimen shall be handled and processed as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-8\">a. The number of staff handling the specimen should be minimized. All items shall then be placed in the refrigerator in the Major\u2019s area. <em>At all times, the specimen should be in the actual possession and control of staff or secured in a manner which does not compromise the integrity of the chain of custody. </em>... (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b88-9\">Pollock claims that \u201cPatuxent disregarded a number of its own mandatory rules relating to establishing a proper chain of custody,\u201d which required exclusion of the test results as a matter of law. Specifically, he points to four \u201cviolations\u201d that he contends rendered the Board\u2019s decision to admit the lab test results and to rely on them in not renewing his parole \u201carbitrary and capricious.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-10\">1.

Hebbville Auto Repair, Inc., </em>369 Md. 439, 449, 800 A.2d 768 (2002). We must reevaluate the administrative decision itself. <em>See id. </em>We uphold the agency\u2019s decision when it is supported by both the agency\u2019s actual findings and the actual reasons advanced by the agency in support of its decision. <em>See United Steelworkers of Am., Local 2610 v. Bethlehem Steel Corp., </em>298 Md. 665, 679, 472 A.2d 62 (1984). In particular, we accept the agency\u2019s findings of fact when they are supported by substantial evidence in the record. <em>See Jordan Towing, </em>369 Md. at 450, 800 A.2d 768. Substantial evidence is \u201c \u2018such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-8\"> We uphold the agency\u2019s decision of law if it is legally correct. <em>See Gigeous v. Eastern Correctional Inst., </em>363 Md. 481, 496, 769 A.2d 912 (2001). \u201cAn agency is best able to discern its intent in promulgating a regulation. Thus, an agency\u2019s interpretation of the meaning and intent of its own regulation is entitled to deference.\u201d <em>Changing Point, Inc. v. Maryland Health Res.

Maryland Inmate Grievance Comm\u2019n, </em>40 Md.App. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>329, 391 A.2d 1213 (1978). <em>Hopkins </em>followed and applied <em>United States ex rel. Accardi v. Shaughnessy, </em>347 U.S. 260, 74 S.Ct. 499, 98 L.Ed. 681 (1954), which established the oft-cited rule of administrative law known as the <em>\u201cAccardi </em>doctrine.\u201d The <em>Accardi </em>doctrine states that \u201c \u2018[a]n agency of the government must scrupulously observe rules, regulations or procedures which it has established. When it fails to do so, its action cannot stand and courts will strike it down.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hopkins, </em>40 Md.App. at 335-36, 391 A.2d 1213 (quoting <em>United States v. Heffner, </em>420 F.2d 809, 811 (4th Cir.1969)).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">\u201c[TJhere is an abundance of authority for the doctrine that an agency cannot violate its own rules and regulations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 336, 391 A.2d 1213. Most recently, the Court of Appeals confirmed that under Maryland law, courts will review an agency\u2019s actions \u201cto determine if the agency complied with its regulations and required procedures.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Maryland Transp. Auth. v. King, </em>369 Md. 274, 286, 799 A.2d 1246 (2002). We have held specifically that the <em>Accardi </em>doctrine applies to the actions of other Maryland .correctional agencies under the auspices of the Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services, including the Department of Corrections (\u201cDOC\u201d). <em>See, e.g., Smith v. State, </em>140 Md.App. 445, 462, 780 A.2d 1199 (2001)(DOC \u201cwas bound by its regulation\u201d governing eligibility of inmates for \u201cdouble celling\u201d diminution credits); <em>Hopkins, </em>40 Md.App. at 337, 391 A.2d 1213 (Inmate Grievance Commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>sion was bound by DOC regulations governing review of decision to commit inmate to solitary confinement).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">If, as Pollock contends, Patuxent staff violated PID 110-18, and if the <em>Accardi </em>doctrine applies to those violations of PID 100-18, then the positive test results should have been excluded, without specifically inquiring whether the violations prejudiced Pollock. As the <em>King </em>Court noted, this Court has \u201ctaken the position that, in situations where the <em>Accardi </em>doctrine is applicable, it does not matter whether one was prejudiced by the failure of the agency to follow its procedures or regulations.\u201d <em>King, </em>369 Md. at 286, 799 A.2d 1246 (citing <em>Bd. of Educ. of Baltimore County v. Ballard, </em>67 Md.App. 235, 239 n. 2, 507 A.2d 192 (1986)(\u201cIf [the agency] was required to strictly follow its rules, whether or not [the agency] was prejudiced by the defect is not an issue\u201d)). In that event, the <em>Accardi </em>doctrine would require the <em>per se </em>exclusion of the Friends lab reports if Patuxent staff members did not strictly comply with PID 110-18.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">Patuxent acknowledges the <em>Accardi </em>doctrine and its potential impact on this case, but argues that the specific violations of PID 110-18 alleged by Pollock fall within the principal exception to the doctrine. This <em>\u201cAccardi </em>exception\u201d states \u201cthat the doctrine does not apply to an agency\u2019s departure from procedural rules adopted for the orderly transaction \u25a0of agency business.\u201d <em>Hopkins, </em>40 Md.App. at 336, 391 A.2d 1213. Thus, not every internal procedural policy adopted by an agency invokes the <em>Accardi </em>doctrine. <em>See Durham v. Fields, </em>87 Md.App. 1, 18 n. 2, 588 A.2d 352, <em>cert. denied, </em>323 Md. 308, 593 A.2d 668 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">Whether the <em>Accardi </em>doctrine applies to this case is a question of law that requires us to examine the language and purpose of PID 110-18.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-8\">In determining whether an agency rule has sufficient force and effect to trigger an application of the <em>Accardi </em>doctrine, Maryland courts generally look to see whether it \u201caffects individual rights and obligations,\u201d <em>See James, </em>96 Md.App. at 422, 625 A.2d 361 (quoting Peter Raven-Han<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>sen, <em>Regulatory Estoppel: When Agencies Break Their Own \u201cLaws\u201d, </em>64 Tex.

These guidelines had been adopted by resolution of the State Board, to compel county boards of education to adopt procedures \u201cnot inconsistent\u201d with those set forth in that resolution. <em>See id. </em>at 30, 411 A.2d 124. The prescribed guidelines, which did not have the effect of a properly promulgated and published rule or regulation, required at least four observations of the probationary teacher each year, by more than one qualified observer, after which the observer consulted with the teacher and submitted a written report. <em>See id. </em>at 30-31, 411 A.2d 124. The lower court concluded that these \u201cguidelines ... were meant to function in part as aids to assist probationary teachers in becoming competente,]\u201d and thus \u201cwere meant to confer an important procedural benefit upon probationary teachers[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 38, 411 A.2d 124.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">We reversed. Although we agreed that the court\u2019s observation \u201c[t]hat probationers are the beneficiaries carries a seed of correctness,\u201d nevertheless we explained that \u201cthe primary purpose of the State Board of Education\u201d was \u201cnot to bestow procedural benefits upon teachers of questionable competency, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>but to bestow upon students education by teachers of unquestionable competency.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 39-40, 411 A.2d 124.

In doing so, we examined several factors weighing against an interpretation of the Procedures as creating a strictly enforceable procedural benefit for teachers. Among those factors were that (1) the State Board interpreted the Procedures as being designed \u201cto improve instruction and professional ability and <em>not </em>to confer procedural benefits!,]\u201d (2) there was no \u201c \u2018regulatory history\u2019 indicating that the Procedures were designed to confer procedural benefits!,]\u201d (3) the title \u201cProcedures for Evaluations of Teaching Staff\u2019 indicated that the procedures were merely \u201c \u2018guidelines!,]\u2019 \u201d (4) \u201cthe language of the Procedures ...

See id. </em>at 423-24, 625 A.2d 361.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">In <em>Durham v.

As set forth below, the title, stated purpose, language, and history of this directive collectively indicate that it was not primarily designed to guarantee parolees that their urine specimens will be collected and documented in precisely the manner described in the directive.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-7\">\u2022 Title and Regulatory History: Although the title given to a set of administrative procedures does not necessarily dictate whether it confers procedural rights or merely establishes internal agency guidelines, it may be evidence of the agency\u2019s intent. <em>See James, </em>96 Md.App. at 423-24, 625 A.2d 361. In contrast to the \u201cPatuxent Institution Regulation\u201d promulgated and published to establish procedures for parole revocation, PID 110-18 is a Patuxent \u201cdirective\u201d that is \u201cconfidential\u201d and \u201crestricted to [Patuxent] staff only.\u201d Thus, it is not a duly promulgated and ' published \u201cregulation\u201d with \u201cthe force and effect of law.\u201d <em>See id.; Barbano, 45 </em>Md.App. at 30, 411 A.2d 124.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-9\">\u2022 Stated purpose and policy: PID 110-18 states that its purpose is \u201c[t]o provide a procedure for monitoring inmates that are or are suspected of being under the influence of intoxicants.\u201d The directive also states that \u201c[i]t is the policy of Patuxent Institution to have a procedure to detect the use of illicit drugs by inmates ____ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>[which] presents a serious threat to the safety, security, and good order of the Institution. Urinalysis testing of inmates can be an effective means by which to detect and discipline inmate use of illicit drugs. Urinalysis testing is intended to supplement, not replace, other means by which inmate use of illicit drugs can be detected and suppressed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b97-4\">These provisions indicate that Patuxent\u2019s primary purpose for this directive is to promote the use of urinalysis testing as a means of controlling drug use by inmates, not to establish a precise rubric for conducting such drug testing. To be sure, the use of the procedures described in the directive does protect the interests of the inmates as well as Patuxent, but a fair reading of the entire directive reveals that to be an incidentally \u201cbeneficial offshoot.\u201d <em>See Barba-no, </em>45 Md.App. at 44, 411 A.2d 124. That reading is consistent with the Board\u2019s interpretation of the directive, to which we give deference. <em>See Changing Point, </em>87 Md. App. at 160, 589 A.2d 502.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">\u2022 Source of authority: The source of authority cited for this directive is a general regulation promulgated by the Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services, which states that \u201c[a] parolee shall give a random urine specimen as required by the parolee\u2019s supervisor.\u201d CO-MAR 12.12.08.09.G (2002). This regulation does not itself confer any procedural benefit on inmates; thus, Patuxent was not obligated to adopt a directive that did so.</p>\n<p id=\"AF2\">\u00abLanguage of the rule: Although the directive provides that \u201c[t]he urine specimen shall be collected from the inmate as follows\u201d and that \u201c[t]he urine specimen shall be handled and processed as follows,\u201d the use of the term \u201cshall\u201d is not necessarily mandatory.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-6\">[I]n Maryland, use of the word \u2018shall\u2019 is ordinarily presumed to be mandatory, although use of the word \u201cshall\u201d is, on occasion, \u201cinterpreted as directory and not mandatory.\u201d In endeavoring to ascertain the intent ... in using the word \u201cshall\u201d, we begin by considering the absence of a sanction in the [rule].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number><em>G &amp; M Ross Enter., Inc. v. Bd. of License Comm\u2019rs of Howard County, </em>111 Md.App. 540, 543, 682 A.2d 1190 (1996). Here, other language in the directive suggests that it was designed to be a set of internal rules for \u201cgood practices\u201d in Patuxent\u2019s urinalysis testing program. For example, in one important provision, regarding \u201chandling and processing\u201d of specimens, the directive uses \u201cshall\u201d and \u201cshould\u201d interchangeably. It states that \u201c[t]he number of staff handling the specimen should be minimized,\u201d and that \u201c[a]t all times, the specimen should be in the actual possession and control of staff or secured in a manner which does not compromise the integrity of the chain of custody,\u201d but also that \u201c[a]ll items shall then be placed in the refrigerator in the Major\u2019s area.\u201d PID 110-18.Vl.A.5.a. Moreover, the lack of any established sanction for violating the procedures in the directive also indicates that they were intended to be \u201cdirectory, rather than mandatory.\u201d <em>G &amp; M Ross Enter., </em>111 Md.App. at 545, 682 A.2d 1190.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">Together, these factors persuade us that PID 110-18 does not confer procedural rights upon Pollock, but instead merely provides for the orderly transaction of Patuxent business.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">That conclusion does not end our inquiry. An agency does not have <em>carte blanche </em>to violate its own procedural policy merely because it is not subject to the <em>Accardi </em>doctrine. An agency\u2019s failure to follow its \u201cinternal administrative procedures\u201d may require reversal of the agency\u2019s action if \u201cthe complaining party can show substantial prejudice.\u201d <em>James, </em>96 Md.App. at 421, 625 A.2d 361. Thus, \u201ceven if an agency rule does not have the force and effect of law (that is, even if it is simply interpretive, a statement of policy, or any other, lesser, rule of agency organization, procedure, or practice), a violation of that rule will still invalidate an agency\u2019s action if the complainant can show that he was substantially prejudiced by the violation.\u201d <em>Anastasi, </em>123 Md.App. at 491 n. 8, 719 A.2d 980.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">The question of whether Pollock was substantially prejudiced by any violation of PID 110-18 dovetails with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>remaining question raised by Pollock\u2019s appeal: whether the Board and the circuit court erred in concluding that the test results provided valid and sufficient grounds for revoking and then not renewing Pollock\u2019s parole. We shall address both questions by examining each of Pollock\u2019s specific complaints about violations of PID 110-18.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">Alleged Violations Requiring Exclusion Of Test Results</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">\u201cNumbers Problems\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b99-9\">PID 110-80.VI.A.4.C states that \u201cstaff shall hand to the inmate the specimen bottle, pre-labeled with the inmate\u2019s name, number, and date[,]\u201d and that \u201c[t]he inmate shall be asked to acknowledge that information on the label is correct[.]\u201d It is undisputed that although Pollock\u2019s inmate number is 4695, the Request for Urinalysis Test form and the Incident Report identified Pollock\u2019s specimen by number 4697; that the Laboratory Testing Requisition Form identified the specimen by number 4669; and that Friends\u2019 test results from the initial test used the 4669 number to identify Pollock\u2019s specimen. It is also undisputed that all of the Patuxent and Friends documents specifically identified the sample by Pollock\u2019s correct first<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and last names.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-10\">The circuit court found generally that Patuxent \u201ccomplied with\u201d PID 110-18 and that there was \u201c \u2018substantial evidence\u2019 in support of the conclusion that the sample submitted by Mr. Pollock contained marijuana,\u201d without specifically discussing whether Patuxent staff properly labeled Pollock\u2019s specimen. Pollock complains that \u201cthe Board\u2019s finding that the samples were one and the same was clearly erroneous,\u201d because \u201cthe number assigned to the urine sample obtained from [him] at Patuxent was not documented in either the Request for Urinalysis Test form, or in the Incident Report.\u201d He points out <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>that the number listed on these two required forms was 4697, which differed not only from Pollock\u2019s inmate number (4695), but also from the number on the test reports prepared by Friends (4669). Moreover, Pollock contends, there is no evidence that any number was placed on the specimen itself. Given this evidence of the non-existence, incorrectness, and/or inconsistency of the numbers on Pollock\u2019s specimen and the Patuxent forms, Pollock asserts, the evidence was not sufficient to support the Board\u2019s finding that the specimen that tested positive was the one that he submitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">Citing the testimony of Sgt. Jones and the three documents prepared at the time Pollock submitted his specimen, the Board responds that \u201cthe specimen and the laboratory result were correctly and unambiguously identified by Pollock\u2019s name,\u201d which was sufficient to identify the positive specimen as belonging to Pollock. It points out, in particular, that Pollock\u2019s name was not similar to the name of any other of the six inmates whose specimens went to Friends for testing along with Pollock\u2019s.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Board acknowledges that the numeric labeling requirement in the directive promotes correct identification of the specimen and the lab results by earmarking each specimen with more than one identifier. Nevertheless, Patux-ent argues, the numeric identification was an \u201cunnecessary\u201d redundancy in Pollock\u2019s case given that there was other evidence that was sufficient to establish the \u201caccurate and unambiguous identification of Pollock\u2019s specimen.\u201d It analogizes the incorrect inmate numbers used in this case to other \u201cminor clerical errors\u201d such as a minor misspelling of an inmate\u2019s name. In either case, it asserts, as long as it can be determined from all of the circumstances that there was little possibility of confusion of identity, such minor errors do not warrant suppression of the test results. <em>See, e.g., Foust v. Goord, </em>262 A.D.2d 904, 694 N.Y.S.2d 489, 490 (1999)(minor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>spelling errors on inmate urinalysis testing forms did not invalidate positive test results).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">A correctional agency attempting to offer urinalysis test results as grounds for revoking parole \u201cmust establish the chain of custody \u2014 that is a basic step in authenticating the evidence prior to its admission.\u201d <em>McDonald v. State, </em>314 Md. 271, 281, 550 A.2d 696 (1988). We agree with Patuxent that, in this case, there was substantial evidence to support the Board\u2019s \u201cchain of custody finding\u201d that it was Pollock\u2019s specimen that tested positive for cannabis on May 17 and 23, 1997, and thus, that Pollock was not prejudiced by the use of numbers other than his correct inmate number to identify his specimen.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">Here, we find it significant that the \u201cLaboratory Testing Requisition Form,\u201d which was the only document that Patux-ent sent to Friends along with Pollock\u2019s specimen, shows that (1) Pollock\u2019s name is not similar to the name of any other inmate whose specimen was sent for testing at the same time as Pollock\u2019s; (2) the \u201cspecimen identity\u201d number listed on the manuscript line directly above Pollock\u2019s signature was \u201c4669;\u201d (3) Friends used the same number to identify Pollock\u2019s specimen in its May 16 report of the positive test results. In these circumstances, the Board did not act arbitrarily or capriciously in concluding that Pollock acknowledged that the specimen he gave on May 15, 1997 was marked with both his name and 4669, albeit that number was not his inmate number.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">We conclude that the use of an identification number other than Pollock\u2019s inmate number on the specimen label does not automatically void the test results, even if it was not \u201cthe inmate\u2019s ... number[.]\u201d Because the name and number identifiers on the Laboratory Testing Requisition Form were acknowledged by Pollock and matched the ones that Friends used in its May 16, 1997 report of the positive test results, there was sufficient evidence to satisfy the test for establishing chain of custody \u2014 that \u201cthere exists the \u2018reasonable probability that no tampering occurred.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hawkins v.

In support, Pollock cites Sgt. Jones\u2019 testimony at the parole revocation hearing, admitting that Pollock \u201csealed the bottle himself. He put the top on and sealed it himself and handed it to me[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">Patuxent counters with two presumptions. First, it relies on the presumption that, in the absence of contradictory evidence, public officers properly perform their duties. <em>See Lerch v. Maryland Port Auth., </em>240 Md. 438, 457, 214 A.2d 761 (1965). Second, it contends that, even if these duties are not carried out properly, there is still a presumption that there is a \u201creasonable probability that no tampering occurred.\u201d <em>Hawkins, </em>77 Md.App. at 347, 550 A.2d 416.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-9\">We do not find the first presumption applicable in this case, because not only is there \u201ccontradictory evidence\u201d that the custody officers did not secure the evidence tape on Pollock\u2019s specimen bottle, but that evidence consisted of an unrebutted admission by Sgt. Jones. Instead, we are persuaded that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>Jones\u2019 unrebutted testimony strongly supported the second presumption. Jones\u2019 testimony that he allowed Pollock to secure the evidence tape while he watched may have established that Jones failed to strictly comply with the procedures in the directive, but it also established a reasonable probability that no tampering occurred at that stage of the collection process.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">Missing Signature On Chain Of Custody Form</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">The third instance of non-compliance that, according to Pollock, requires exclusion of the urinalysis test results is that Patuxent\u2019s chain of custody document failed to reflect that Pollock\u2019s specimen was handled by C.O. Taylor as well as Sgt. Jones. He points to the portion of the required \u201cRequest for Urinalysis Test\u201d form stating that the specimen went \u201c[f]rom above-named inmate [tjo APJones,\u201d then \u201c[fjrom AP-Jones to lockLed] refrigerator,\u201d even though Jones testified at the revocation hearing that after Pollock handed him the sealed specimen, he \u201chanded it to Officer James Taylor to put in the locked refrigerator\u201d while Jones and Pollock were there. Neither Taylor\u2019s name nor his signature appear in the chain of custody portion of the form.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">In response, the Board relies on <em>Martin v. State, </em>78 Md. App. 541, 545, 554 A.2d 429, <em>cert. denied, </em>316 Md. 428, 559 A.2d 790 (1989), in which we distinguished \u201cbare possession\u201d from \u201ccustody\u201d in concluding that a state trooper had only \u201cbare possession\u201d of evidence when he did nothing but hand an item of evidence to another state trooper. Accordingly, the fact that the chain of custody form did not reflect the trooper\u2019s \u201cbare custody\u201d did not require exclusion of the evidence. We agree with the Board that Taylor\u2019s fleeting contact with Pollock\u2019s specimen was \u201cbare possession,\u201d and that the test results cannot be excluded on the ground that Taylor\u2019s name does not appear in the chain of custody portion of the Patuxent form.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>D.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">Missing Medical Laboratory Chain of Custody Form</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">Pollock\u2019s final item of \u201cnon-compliance\u201d concerns the failure of the Patuxent staff to produce a copy of the Medical Laboratory Chain of Custody Form. PID 110-18.VI.A.4.g., which Pollock relies on, states that \u201c[t]he original copy of the Medical Laboratory Chain of Custody Form shall be retained until the specimens are picked up for testing. The original copy shall be signed by and released to the Medical Laboratory courier. The duplicate copy shall be sent to the Major\u2019s Office.\u201d Pollock complains that Sgt. Jones did not testify that the form was actually completed or that a copy of the form was sent to the Major\u2019s office.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">Patuxent contends, and we agree, that, given the testimony of the officers, the Laboratory Testing Requisition form that is signed by Pollock, and the Request for Urinalysis Test form, no additional evidence was necessary to establish the chain of custody in this case. <em>See, e.g., </em>Md.Code (1984, 1999 Repl.Vol.) \u00a7 10-213(d)(4) of the State Government Article (officer presiding over a contested administrative case may exclude unduly repetitious evidence). Contrary to Pollock\u2019s contention, the directive does not require that the copy of the form sent to the \u201cMajor\u2019s Office\u201d must be produced to establish a chain of custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-8\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b104-9\">There is enough evidence in this administrative record to support the Board\u2019s finding that the positive urine specimen belonged to Pollock. Because the Board\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence that Pollock violated his parole by using marijuana, including the positive urinalysis test results, and it committed no error of law, we must affirm its decision. <em>See Baltimore County Licensed Beverage Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. Kwon, </em>135 Md.App. 178, 186-87, 761 A.2d 1027 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-10\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED. COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b84-9\">. Pollock also testified on his own behalf, suggesting that the positive test results might have reflected medication he took for a heart condition, \"second-hand smoke\u201d to which he was exposed, or retribution by a friend.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b87-11\">. The term \u201cinmate\" is defined to include parolees. <em>See </em>Patuxent Institution Directive 110-18.IV.b.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b90-6\">. Interestingly, this opinion, which was filed after oral argument in this case, points out that the Court of Appeals had \"not previously discussed the <em>Accardi </em>doctrine as such, or even cited <em>Accardi </em>[.]\u201d <em>Maryland Transp. Auth. </em>v. <em>King, </em>369 Md. 274, 286, 799 A.2d 1246 (2002). The Court noted in dictum that \"[t]he Court of Special Appeals has recognized or applied the <em>Accardi </em>doctrine in numerous opinions[ .]\" <em>Id., </em>369 Md. at 285, 799 A.2d 1246. Ultimately, however, the Court declined to \"further explore the <em>Accardi </em>doctrine and the extent of its applicability to Maryland administrative proceedings .... because ... the Maryland Transportation Authority did not violate any of its regulations.\u201d <em>Id., </em>369 Md. at 287, 799 A.2d 1246. <em>See also Jordan Towing, Inc. v. Hebbville Auto Repair, Inc., </em>369 Md. 439, 454-55, 800 A.2d 768 (2002)(quoting <em>King </em>and stating that \"[w]e have previously indicated that, generally, an administrative agency should follow its own established rules, regulations and procedures\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b99-11\">. On two forms, Pollock\u2019s first name was misspelled as \"Miche\u00e1l.\u2019\u2019</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b100-6\">. The other names and inmate numbers on the \"Laboratory Requisition Test Form\u201d were \"James Gregory #9010,\u201d \"Michael Figgs #8993,\u201d \u201cBenny Brown # 2860,\u201d \"Guy Marshall # 2957,\u201d \"Charles Gillespie # 5352,\u201d and \"Fernando Stuart # 4011.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b102-10\">. In reaching this decision, however, we do not agree with the Board\u2019s broad assertion that the use of incorrect inmate numbers to identify a specimen always can be disregarded as an \u201cunnecessary redundancy\u201d or a \"minor clerical error.\u201d Numerical errors may not be so easily recognized as spelling errors, nor as benign as in this case. In another case, in which the incorrect inmate number, raises a reasonable doubt as to the identity of the positive specimen, such an error could be reason to exclude the test results.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
