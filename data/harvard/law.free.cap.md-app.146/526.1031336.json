Young retired as a County police officer in September 1992, and was diagnosed with dementia in 1995, at the age of fifty-three. At the time of Young\u2019s death on October 19, 1997, he was survived by a minor child, Theresa Young;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> a sister, Susan Grier; and his wife, from whom he had separated.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-9\">Pursuant to a marital separation agreement (the \u201cSeparation Agreement\u201d or \u201cAgreement\u201d), executed by appellant and Young in September 1996, the Youngs waived their respective rights to the other\u2019s retirement funds. In March 1997, the Decedent also executed a change of beneficiary form, naming his sister as the beneficiary under the Plan. The circumstances that led to the execution of the Separation Agreement and the change of beneficiary form are in dispute. Nevertheless, based on the Agreement, the County\u2019s Office of Personnel refused to award Young\u2019s pension benefits to appellant. Aggrieved by that determination, appellant filed a claim with the Anne Arundel County Board of Appeals (the \u201cBoard\u201d). At a hearing on May 26, 1998, the Board refused to address <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>appellant\u2019s challenges to the validity of the Agreement and change of beneficiary form, and denied her request for pension benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\">Appellant then sought judicial review of the Board\u2019s decision in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County. On September 1, 1998, while the judicial review petition was pending, appellant filed a Complaint for Declaratory Judgment. The circuit court stayed the declaratory action and remanded the matter to the Board for further consideration of appellant\u2019s claims. Thereafter, the Board held an evidentiary hearing on May 27, 1999, but declined to consider the validity of the Agreement or change of beneficiary form. Presuming those documents to be valid, the Board rejected appellant\u2019s request for benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">The circuit court subsequently consolidated the declaratory action and appellant\u2019s second administrative review petition. The parties then filed cross-motions for summary judgment. Following a hearing, the court concluded, <em>inter alia, </em>that appellant waived any claim to Young\u2019s pension benefits when she executed the Separation Agreement. Accordingly, the court granted the County\u2019s summary judgment motion and denied appellant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">On appeal, Ms. Young presents several issues for our consideration, which we have rephrased and reordered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-7\">I. Whether appellant\u2019s status as the spouse of a retired, deceased police officer entitled her to the survivor benefits under the Plan.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-8\">II. Whether appellant could lawfully waive her rights to benefits under the Plan, pursuant to the marital separation agreement executed by appellant and Charles Young.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-9\">III. Was the waiver language in the separation agreement sufficient to constitute a waiver of benefits?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-10\">IV. Was the filing with Aetna of the Change in Beneficiary Form effective, as a matter of law, to deprive appellant of benefits under the Plan, despite her status as the spouse and joint annuitant of Charles Young?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>V. Did the court err in granting summary judgment to the County as to the claims of duress and incapacity, because the validity and enforceability of the marital separation agreement presented disputes of material fact?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">For the reasons that follow, we shall vacate the award of summary judgment and remand this case to the circuit court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">FACTUAL SUMMARY</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">Young was born on February 22, 1942, and began his service with the County in 1970. Appellant, who was born on May 19, 1946, married Young on February 15, 1992. On July 15, 1992, in anticipation of his impending retirement from the County police on September 1, 1992, Young executed the \u201cANNE ARUNDEL COUNTY RETIREMENT INCENTIVE PROGRAM PARTICIPATION AGREEMENT.\u201d From the time of his retirement until his death in October 1997, Young was married to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">Aetna Life Insurance Company (\u201cAetna\u201d) has served as the third-party administrator of the County\u2019s Police Service Retirement Plan since July 1, 1969, pursuant to a \u201cGROUP ANNUITY CONTRACT\u201d (the \u201cContract\u201d) with the County. In that capacity, Aetna makes annuity and other payments of pension benefits to the beneficiaries of the Plan. Pursuant to the Plan, codified in Anne Arundel County Code (\u201cA.A.C.C.\u201d), Art. 7, Title 5, \u00a7 5-102, Young received two annuity payments per month under the Plan. One payment was in the amount of $1835.00, and the other was in the amount of $263.52.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-9\">According to the County, Aetna was its authorized agent with respect to the Plan. Section 11 of the Contract concerns \u201cTermination and Death Benefits,\u201d and \u00a7 11G pertains to Beneficiaries. It states, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-10\">11G <em>Beneficiaries</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-11\">11G-1 A Member may name a beneficiary to receive any Death Benefit which may become due on or after his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>death.... Any named beneficiary may be changed by the Member from time to time....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-5\">11G-2.... A Retired Member may name or change his beneficiary by written request filed at the Home Office of Aetna. A request filed with the Contractholder shall be forwarded by the Contractholder to Aetna, in accordance with Aetna\u2019s established administrative procedures, at least one month before the Member becomes a Retired Member or, if he dies before becoming a Retired Member, promptly after his death.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-6\">11G-3 A request to name or change a beneficiary will be effective on the date it is signed by a Member, whether or not the Member is living when the request is receiver by Aetna at its Home Office, but without prejudice to Aetna because of any payments made by Aetna before receipt of the request at its Home Office.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-7\">11G-4 Aetna will make a Death Benefit payment to the appropriate payee listed below if, on the date the Death Benefit payment is due, no beneficiary has been duly named by the member or no named beneficiary is alive. The payees are as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-8\">(a) the surviving spouse of the member, if any....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-9\">On or about July 13, 1992, Young executed an Aetna form titled \u201cELECTION AND INFORMATION FORM,\u201d in which he selected the \u201cJOINT ANNUITY OPTION\u201d in Section D, naming Gail Young as his wife and \u201cJoint Annuitant.\u201d That portion of the form provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-10\">With 100% of the annuity payable to be continued to my Joint Annuitant upon my death. I designate my Joint Annuitant Gail Young Wife</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-12\">(Name) (Relationship)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-13\">Under \u00a7 G, Young also elected payment of his benefits to begin on September 1, 1992. That portion of the form contains a space for the \u201cDesignation of Beneficiary,\u201d but no name is inserted in the line provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-14\">On the same date, Young also completed an Aetna form entitled \u201cDESIGNATION/CHANGE OF BENEFICIARY,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>which was filed with the County\u2019s Personnel Office. Under \u201cMARITAL STATUS,\u201d Young wrote \u201cMARRIED.\u201d In this form, Young designated appellant as the sole primary beneficiary of the Plan, and he named his daughter as the sole secondary beneficiary. The document states, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"alq-dedup-0\">CONDITIONS \u2014 Unless otherwise expressly provided on this Designation/Change of Beneficiary form, any sum becoming payable upon my death under my employer\u2019s plan will be payable as prescribed in such plan. <em>After payment of any amount required by the plan to be paid to my spouse, any remaining benefit will be paid to:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-5\">a. My designated primary beneficiary or beneficiaries if they should survive me;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-6\">b. My designated secondary beneficiary or beneficiaries if no designated primary beneficiary or beneficiaries survive me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-7\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-8\">\n<em>If my marital status changes, the validity of this designation may be affected. In the event of such a change, I should complete a new Designation Change of Beneficiary form.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-9\">DESIGNATION REQUEST \u2014 Subject to the terms of my employer\u2019s plan, I request that any sum becoming due upon my death be payable to the beneficiary(ies) designated below. I understand this designation shall revoke all prior beneficiary designations made by me under my employer\u2019s plan.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b562-10\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-11\">Young and appellant each signed the document, certifying that \u201cthis Designation of Beneficiary is subject to all the CONDITIONS stated above.\u201d Under their signatures, the following appears: \u201cTo the best of my knowledge, the marital status of the participant/designator is as shown above.\u201d The signature of Mr. Valle, a County Personnel Office employee, appears in the space provided for the \u201cSIGNATURE OF PLAN REPRESENTATIVE.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b563-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>The designations of appellant as spouse, beneficiary, and joint annuitant were the only designations filed with the County\u2019s Personnel Office. No change was ever made in the records of the Personnel Office with regard to those designations.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\">As we noted, Young was diagnosed with dementia in 1995, at 53 years of age. At about the same time, appellant\u2019s stepfather died and her mother, who lived in Virginia, suffered a severe stroke, which resulted in significant paralysis. As a result of appellant\u2019s financial circumstances, she had to work outside the home while trying to care for both her mother and husband. Because of her difficulties, appellant sought help in February 1996 from Young\u2019s sister and brother-in-law, Susan and Robert Grier, who lived in upstate New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">According to appellant, in March 1996 Young began to reside with the Griers, because they were in a position to provide him with the full-time care that he needed. Nevertheless, appellant claims that she maintained regular contact with Young until May 1996, when the Griers allegedly denied her visitation. Appellant asserts that in June 1996 the Griers asked her to consent to their appointment as guardians of the person and property of Young. According to appellant, when she refused to consent, the Griers retaliated by refusing \u201cscheduled visits\u201d with her husband, including a visit planned for June 28,1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">Appellant claims that, on or about July 8, 1996, the Griers contacted her regarding Young\u2019s need for \u201cconstant supervision and medical care,\u201d and they suggested that she sign a marital separation agreement. Then, in August 1996, appellant received the Agreement in the mail, which had been prepared by the Griers\u2019 attorney. According to appellant, the \u201cGriers represented to Gail Young that unless she signed the [Ajgreement, they would never permit her to see Charles Young again.\u201d Young reportedly signed the Agreement before a notary public on September 9, 1996, and appellant executed it on September 20,1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">The Agreement states, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>1. It shall be lawful for the Wife at all times hereafter to live separate and apart from the Husband, and free from his marital control and authority as if she were sole and unmarried and free from any control, restraint, or interference, direct or indirect, by the Husband; and it shall be lawful for the Husband at all times hereafter to live separate and apart from the Wife, and free from her marital control and authority as if he were sole and unmarried and free from any control, restraint, or interference, direct or indirect, by the Wife.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-5\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-6\">13. The Husband is the owner of a certain joint and survivor annuity which was available to him through his former employer, Anne Arundel County, Maryland. Currently this annuity is handled by Aetna Life Insurance Company under certif\u00edcate # 164340273. <em>The Wife </em>specifically acknowledges that she is aware of this account, is familiar with benefits associated therewith and <em>waives any interest of any nature thereunder in that account or any successor accounts thereto. The Wife further agrees that the Husband may name any beneficiary to any death benefits associated with this plan.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-7\">13a. The Wife has an interest in two retirement plans from previous employers. They are a 401-K Plan with Blue Cross/Blue Shield which has been rolled over into an Individual Retirement Account # 226-60-6287 with Investors \u2022 Fiduciary Trust Co., and a Vested Life Annuity through Blue Cross of Maryland\u2019s Inc. retirement program. The Husband specifically acknowledges that he is aware of these accounts, is familiar with the benefits associated therewith, and waives any interest of any nature thereunder in those accounts or any successor accounts thereto. The Husband further agrees that the Wife may name any beneficiary to any death benefit associated with either of these plans.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-8\">16. The provisions of this agreement shall not prevent either party from suing for a divorce in any jurisdiction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>either within or without the United States upon such grounds that he or she may elect or be advised, but the parties shall nevertheless be bound by all of the terms hereof, and this agreement shall survive a divorce or annulment decree that may be obtained by either party, against the other.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">Soon afterwards, beginning September 28, 1996, Young visited with appellant in Maryland, and remained with her until October 12, 1996. During the visit, appellant observed that Young was \u201cin a vegetative state\u201d and his \u201cmental condition had deteriorated significantly.\u201d She claims that her husband lacked the ability to communicate, and could not remember significant family dates or names. Upon Young\u2019s return to New York, appellant claims that the Griers cut off all further communication with her; she never saw her husband again.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">On March 18, 1997, Young executed a \u201cDESIGNATION/CHANGE OF BENEFICIARY\u201d form, designating his sister, Susan Grier, as primary beneficiary, and her husband, Robert Grier, as secondary beneficiary. Under \u201cMARITAL STATUS\u201d he wrote \u201cMARRIED-SEPARATED.\u201d Young\u2019s signature differed markedly from the signature on his original \u201cDESIGNATION/CHANGE OF BENEFICIARY\u201d form, executed about five years earlier. The bottom of the document contains the following pre-printed statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-7\">I certify that I agree to the designation by my spouse of a beneficiary other than myself. 1 understand that, if I have not been named a beneficiary, I will not be entitled to any death benefit payable under the plan; further, that if I have been named a beneficiary, but not the sole beneficiary, I will not be entitled to the entire death benefit payable under the plan.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">The form also contains a signature line, under the heading of \u201cSIGNATURE OF SPOUSE.\u201d Appellant never signed the form, however. The \u201cSIGNATURE OF PLAN REPRESENTATIVE\u201d was also left blank. Aetna apparently received this form on April 8, 1997, but the document was not filed with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>County\u2019s Personnel Officer prior to Young\u2019s death. Instead, it was filed directly with Aetna.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">In April 1997, a few weeks after Young executed the change of beneficiary form, he was institutionalized. He remained there until his death on October 19,1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">After Young\u2019s death, appellant contacted the County Personnel Office regarding her benefits under the Plan. <em>See </em>A.A.C.C. \u00a7 5-104. By letter dated November 3, 1997, Dennis Buckley, a Personnel Analyst with the County Personnel Office, responded to appellant\u2019s inquiry, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-7\">We are sorry to hear of the death of your husband, Charles. As Mr. Young\u2019s Joint Annuitant, you are entitled to certain benefits from Anne Arundel County.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-8\">RETIREMENT \u2014 As a member of the Police Retirement Plan, the normal form of retirement for a police officer married at the time of retirement is a 100% Joint and Survivor Annuity Payment Option. As M r. Young\u2019s named joint annuitant you are entitled to receive a monthly benefit, commencing November 1, 1997, of $2,383,81, less any authorized deductions. This benefit will continue for your lifetime, unless you remarry.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-9\">Thereafter, the County received a letter from the Griers\u2019 attorney, advising that appellant had signed the Agreement, in which she waived her rights to any benefits under the Plan. The Griers\u2019 attorney also provided the County with a copy of the Agreement. In addition, the County received from Aetna the change of beneficiary form, executed by Young in March 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-10\">Accordingly, by letter dated December 29, 1997, E. Hilton Wade, a County Personnel Officer, advised appellant- that the County had rescinded its decision as to benefits payable to appellant under the Plan. The letter stated, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A_P\">We received a copy of a separation agreement, dated September 9, 1996 which states in part that you were aware of Mr. Young\u2019s pension and the associated benefits and that you waived any interest, of any nature, in the pension. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>goes on to state that Mr. Young could \u201cname any beneficiary to any death benefits associated with the plan.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-5\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-6\">You executed the separation agreement before a notary public on September 20, 1996.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-7\">On March 18, 1997, Mr. Young executed and forwarded a DESIGNATION/CHANGE OF BENEFICIARY form to AETNA Life Insurance Company.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-8\">April 8, 1997, AETNA received this form. However, copies of the beneficiary form and the executed separation agreement were not forwarded to our office for inclusion in Mr. Young\u2019s retiree file. \u2022</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-9\">Upon Mr. Young\u2019s death, you contacted our office inquiring about the benefits available as Mr. Young\u2019s spouse. Our office notified you by letter dated November 3, 1997, of what we believed were your entitlements based on the information contained in Mr. Young\u2019s file.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-10\">As the Plan Administrator and based on the available information, it is my opinion that you entered a valid and enforceable waiver in which you released all claims to any benefits under the plan and that the primary beneficiary designated on the beneficiary form dated March 18, 1997 is entitled to receive any death benefits associated with the plan.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b567-11\">Ms. Young subsequently appealed that decision to the Board, which held a hearing on May 26, 1998.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Board was of the view that it had no jurisdiction to determine the validity of the Agreement or the competency of the Decedent. Therefore, it stayed the matter, \u201cpending the resolution of matters the Board deemed outside its jurisdiction.\u201d Subsequently, appellant sought judicial review in the circuit court. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>Additionally, she filed a multi-count Complaint for Declaratory Judgment on September 1,1998.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">On February 12,1999, the circuit court issued a remand and ordered the Board to \u201clift its stay of administrative proceedings ... and \u2018decide whatever issues it deems are within its jurisdiction.\u2019 \u201d The court also stayed the declaratory action pending a decision of the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">The Board held an evidentiary hearing on May 27, 1999. Nevertheless, the Board again confined its review to the \u201cfour corners of the Anne Arundel County Police Service Retirement Plan,\u201d and declined to consider the matters that it considered as beyond its jurisdiction. At the outset of that hearing, the Board chairman said, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>I\u2019m going to state right from the very beginning we believe now as we did then that <em>we do not have any jurisdiction to determine whether this was a legal separation agreement. So that\u2019s issue number one, that we\u2019re not going to take any verbal testimony.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-5\">Issue number two ... <em>we\u2019re not of the jurisdiction to determine whether there\u2019s any mental competency was of Mr. Young </em>[sic] at the time any of this transpired with regards to his pension....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-6\">We will, however, because we feel those issues must be answered in the court allow both parties, if they wish to do so, to protect the record, to put in the documentations. For instance, the Separation Agreement can be part of the record, also any documentation that the petitioner may have as to the mental competency of Mr. Young at the time. That can be part of the record and documentation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-7\">We certainly have no jurisdiction to determine about what impact they would have on this ... case and unfortunately <em>those issues must be resolved. </em>We will do the best we can absent any verbal testimony in these areas to make a finding that would satisfy the court once they resolve these issues to determine what should happen with the pension.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aq7\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">In his opening statement, appellant\u2019s attorney told the Board that Ms. Grier, the Decedent\u2019s sister, \u201chad her eye\u201d on the benefits under the Plan, and sought to deprive appellant of \u201cher rights\u201d under the Plan. Characterizing the case as \u201ccomplex,\u201d appellant\u2019s counsel explained that Ms. Young challenged the County\u2019s construction of the Agreement, and was appealing the determination that she had waived her rights to benefits. But, her lawyer asserted that their \u201chands are very limited\u201d as to \u201cwhat [they] can get into\u201d to respond to what the County had \u201cplaced ... in issue.\u201d In outlining the issues, Ms. Young\u2019s lawyer said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-9\">Was this properly filed with the [C]ounty? That\u2019s an issue in this case.... Was this Change of Beneficiary form signed by my client, Gail Young, as the document itself purports to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>require? Did the \u2014 was the [C]ounty within its rights and did it properly review this outside document, this Separation Agreement in determining whether or not benefits should be awarded here?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-4\">Another issue is if the [C]ounty was within its rights to review this document, is this a valid waiver by my client? In other words is it knowing and intelligent? Did she know what the benefits were that she was waiving?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-5\">And finally we have this issue of \u2014 of Mr. Young\u2019s competency when he signed these documents \u2014 these two documents. So these are all major issues \u2014 issues that we\u2019ll not be reaching tonight pursuant to your direction, but issues nonetheless if this document was \u2014 was appropriately considered by the Board \u2014 by the personnel office in making their decision. If not, our job becomes much more simple because we are then confined to language of the <em>County Code.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">In his opening, the County\u2019s attorney characterized the matter as a \u201ckind of competition for these benefits.\u201d According to the County, Ms. Young had waived her rights under the Agreement, and the Decedent lawfully changed the beneficiary forms. As the County\u2019s lawyer explained, after consulting with the County Office of Law, the County determined there was an \u201ceffective waiver of any benefits ...\u201d under the Plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">Dennis Buckley, a Personnel Analyst with the County Office of Personnel, testified at the hearing. He explained that, upon the death of a Plan participant, an eligible spouse is entitled to the continued receipt of the police officer\u2019s retirement benefits for the balance of the surviving spouse\u2019s life, or until the spouse re-marries. In contrast, if a participant dies within five years of retirement, without an eligible spouse, a designated beneficiary is only entitled to continuation of the payments for the period remaining between the date of retirement and a total of five years. In that circumstance, benefits cannot be paid for more than five years.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-8\">According to Buckley, the Plan contains a hierarchy of benefit payments upon the death of a retiree. Under A.A.C.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>\u00a7 5-211(f), benefits are \u201cpayable first to an elected contingent annuitant.\u201d If there is no elected contingent annuitant, benefits are payable to a spouse; if there is no spouse, they are payable to minor children; if there are no minor children, then benefits are payable to a beneficiary. Buckley testified that the Decedent did not elect a contingent annuitant, and therefore \u201cthe first taker of any benefits would be the spouse,\u201d in accordance with \u00a7 5 \u2014 211(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">In his testimony, Buckley said that Aetna functions as the \u201cthird party payer\u201d for the Plan, and \u201c[t]hey pay the benefits out.\u201d Initially, Buckley determined that appellant should receive death benefits under the Plan, but that decision was later changed, based on an opinion from the County\u2019s Office of Law. Buckley explained: \u201c[B]ased on the Separation Agreement that was presented to us ... Mrs. Young had indeed waived her rights to any interest to the pension____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">Buckley recalled that the Personnel Office received from Aetna a change of beneficiary form executed by Young. As a result, the County determined that Ms. Grier was the beneficiary. Pursuant to \u00a7 5-211(g), however, no benefits were paid to Ms. Grier, because Young died more than five years after he retired.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">Thomas Mullenix, the County\u2019s Director of Employee Benefits, testified that the matter of benefits was raised with the County Office of Law and, in the opinion of that office, the Agreement was valid and enforceable. The Personnel Office relied on that opinion in denying benefits to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">In a written decision of August 11,1999, the Board affirmed the Personnel Office. The Board reiterated that it had \u201cno jurisdiction to determine the enforceability of ... the Separation Agreement,\u201d or to determine whether the Decedent was competent when he executed the change of beneficiary form. Therefore, the Board \u201cpresum[ed] that both the Separation Agreement and Change of Beneficiary Form [were] valid,\u201d and concluded that appellant was not entitled to the benefits. It said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>The Board finds that the Personnel Officer rightfully denied Ms. Young\u2019s request for Mr. Young\u2019s pension. Participants in the County\u2019s pension program may change the designated beneficiary.... Mr. Young filed a change of beneficiary notice on a form provided by Aetna.... The Board finds that this form ... meets the requirement that the form be satisfactory to the Personnel Officer.... The Board also finds that Mr. Young properly filed the form since it was delivered to Aetna. The Code requires that the designation of spouses and beneficiaries be filed with the Personnel Officer. [Anne Arundel County Code (the \u201cCode\u201d), Article 7, Pension Plan, Section 5-210(b) ]. Aetna is the County\u2019s agent for purposes of administering the pension program. The correspondence regarding the plan is generated by Aetna. The participants in the plan deal with Aetna. The Board finds that the requirement that the forms be filed with the Personnel Officer is met when a participant files the form with Aetna, as agent of the County.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-5\">The most recent designation/change of beneficiary form filed by Mr. Young reflected that the beneficiary of his pension is Susan K. Grier, the sister of Mr. Young. The Separation Agreement states that Mr. Young, \u201cmay name any beneficiary to any death benefits associated with\u201d his Aetna annuity. The Board finds that together these items constitute a proper designation of beneficiary by Mr. Young.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-6\">The pension plan clearly favors the payment of benefits to the named \u201cbeneficiary\u201d over payments to a \u201cspouse.\u201d Only if no name has been filed or if the named beneficiary does not survive the participant are the benefits permitted to be paid to others. Section 5-201(b). The benefits that would have been paid to the named beneficiary can then be paid \u201cat the option of the Personnel Officer to either the participant\u2019s surviving spouse, the participant\u2019s surviving children in equal shares, or the executor or administrator of the participant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-7\">The Board notes, however, that if the Circuit Court determines that Ms. Young did not waive her rights to Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>Young\u2019s pension in the Separation Agreement and the Change of Beneficiary Form is invalid due to Ms. Young\u2019s incompetence then Ms. Young may be entitled to Mr. Young\u2019s pension benefits. Unfortunately, this Board has no jurisdiction to decide such matters.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">Appellant sought judicial review of the Board\u2019s decision. That case was captioned No. C-99-57676-AA. In addition, appellant moved to consolidate the second petition for judicial review with the declaratory action, claiming that the issues were \u201cidentical\u201d and included, <em>inter alia, </em>whether the County could consider the Agreement; whether Young had sufficient mental capacity when he executed the Agreement and the change in beneficiary form; and whether appellant executed the Agreement \u201cunder duress.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">On July 6, 2000, appellant filed a motion for summary judgment in the judicial review case, solely \u201con the basis that the Aetna form could not change the benefits due to Gail Young.\u201d She claimed it was the one issue for which the facts were undisputed, and which could be dispositive of the entire case. On August 4, 2000, the County filed a cross-motion for summary judgment \u201con all issues,\u201d as well as an opposition to appellant\u2019s motion. It argued that \u201cthe filing of the form with Aetna life insurance company constituted substantial compliance with the county code requirements;\u201d the \u201cCode\u2019s provision regarding the procedures to change or designate new beneficiaries is directory, rather than being mandatory;\u201d one\u2019s \u201cstatus as a spouse does not automatically make a person a beneficiary\u201d under the Plan; appellant \u201cwaived any claim to plan benefits;\u201d and appellant \u201ccannot impeach the separation agreement.\u201d In opposition to the County\u2019s motion, appellant claimed, <em>inter alia, </em>that the Agreement was not \u201cenforceable\u201d because she \u201cwas under duress or diminished capacity and was coerced at the time she signed\u201d it.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>The parties submitted various exhibits, including the Separation Agreement and affidavits. In an affidavit of Buckley offered by the County, Buckley averred, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-5\">6. Attached as Exhibit \u201cC\u201d are excerpts from the Contract [between the County and Aetna]. Section 11 G-2 provides as follows: \u201cA Retired Member may name or change his beneficiary by a written request filed at the Home Office of Aetna.\u201d In other words, the procedure under the Contract for changing a beneficiary designation was to file the necessary form with Aetna, not the Office of Personnel. This procedure has been in place for many years.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">Appellant submitted an affidavit of Dr. Jorge Perez-Alard, M.D., an internist. He related that he began to treat Young in early November 1995 for multiple signs of dementia associated with Alzheimer\u2019s, a \u201cprogressive and degenerative mental illness ... of a permanent and debilitating nature.\u201d Young \u201chad difficulty understanding, speaking and processing information necessary for the conduct of daily life,\u201d and his condition progressively deteriorated, causing physical and mental health problems, including paralysis. Based on the doctor\u2019s expertise and his review of the medical records, he opined, \u201cto a reasonable degree of medical certainty,\u201d that, as of September 9, 1996, when Young executed the Separation Agreement, his \u201ccapacity to understand a written document such as a contract was so severely limited that he did not have the capacity to understand what was in it or the importance ... of the words.\u201d Moreover, the doctor opined that Young\u2019s condition would not have improved as of March 18, 1997, when Young executed the change of beneficiary form.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">On August 18, 2000, the court signed a \u201cConsent Order To Consolidate Cases.\u201d The order provided for the consolidation of the judicial review case and the declaratory action \u201cfor all determinations,\u201d and directed the parties to use the declaratory action case number (C-98-49102-AA) for all future filings.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-8\">At the motions hearing on October 28, 2000, the County acknowledged that, in reaching its decision, the Board had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>presumed the validity of the Separation Agreement and the change of beneficiary form. The County maintained, <em>inter alia, </em>that by executing the Agreement appellant waived her \u201cstatutory right\u201d to the pension benefits. The County also argued that Young was entitled to file the change of beneficiary form either with Aetna or the County. Appellee explained that Aetna \u201chad a long-standing contract with the County for over 20 years.... And in that contract, one of their contract duties is to receive and act upon change of beneficiary forms.\u201d The County also maintained that \u201cnothing in the Code ... gives any sort of particular approval process, so there is nothing ... that says that the wife has to sign\u201d the change in beneficiary form, and it would have been \u201credundant\u201d for her to do so, in light of the Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">Appellant advanced a host of arguments. She contended that she was qualified for the pension in three ways: as spouse, as beneficiary, and as joint annuitant. She insisted that a spouse can only waive her rights to benefits as part of a divorce, pursuant to a court order. Appellant also asserted that the County\u2019s Personnel Office had \u201cno legal authority\u201d to consider either the Agreement or change of beneficiary form because they were not part of the official pension file. As to the change of beneficiary form, appellant claimed that filing the form with Aetna was ineffective, because such forms had to be filed directly with the Personnel Office; it had no authority to delegate that responsibility to Aetna. Rather, Aetna\u2019s authority was limited to \u201chow to handle the money in the plan.\u201d Moreover, she maintained that the beneficiary form executed in March 1997 did not alter appellant\u2019s priority status as the spouse. Further, she asserted that the change of beneficiary form was ineffective because it was incomplete, in that neither Ms. Young nor a County representative signed it. Even if the County could consider the Agreement, she claimed the language of the Agreement was not sufficient to effect a waiver of rights, because it was too general and failed to mention the expectancy or survivorship interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">Although appellant did not specifically assert in the declaratory action that the Agreement was invalid due to duress, she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>made that claim in her opposition to the County\u2019s summary judgment motion. There, she expressly claimed the Agreement was not enforceable because it was executed \u201cunder duress or diminished capacity and [she] was coerced.... \u201d Appellant also argued at the hearing that she \u201cwas under duress at the time she signed the Agreement,\u201d and that Young lacked the mental capacity to contract.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Her lawyer said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ao1Y\">It is our contention that if you find all the other issues against us ... then you have to have a trial on the factual issues of, was there contractual capacity of the parties to enter into a contract at the time the separation agreement was signed, one. And two, even if Chuck Young had contractual capacity at the time, then is Mrs. Young under duress at the time she signed it enough to vitiate her contractual capacity?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">Thereafter, in a unitary \u201cMemorandum Of Opinion And Order\u201d of October 26, 2000, the court granted the County\u2019s summary judgment motion and denied appellant\u2019s summary judgment motion.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It also declared that, under \u00b6 13 of the Agreement, appellant waived her interest in the Plan, either as an annuitant or a beneficiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">The court ruled that appellant was entitled to waive her claim to the pension benefits and, as a result of her execution of the Separation Agreement, she validly waived any claim under the Plan. The court also rejected appellant\u2019s other claims. In particular, the court ruled that the designation of beneficiary or annuitant \u201cis subject to change\u201d; the filing of the change of beneficiary form with Aetna, rather than with the County, was legally adequate, because it constituted substantial compliance with the County Code; and appellant cannot \u201cavoid\u201d the Separation Agreement based on the Decedent\u2019s alleged incompetency, because \u201cshe gained the benefits\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>under the Agreement and waited more than a year after Mr. Young\u2019s death to raise the issue. The court did not specifically address appellant\u2019s contention that she executed the Agreement under duress, nor did the court address appellant\u2019s claim that a spouse or joint annuitant takes priority over the named beneficiary. The court also failed to address appellant\u2019s contention that, even if the change in beneficiary form could be filed with Aetna, the form was ineffective because it was incomplete.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">In its opinion, the court set forth the standard of review with respect to judicial review of the Board\u2019s decision, but it omitted any reference to the standard that governs the resolution of a declaratory judgment action or a summary judgment motion. Substantively, the court stated, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-6\">This Court finds that the [appellant], pursuant to Paragraph 13 of the separation agreement between the [appellant] and Charles E. Young, Jr., waived any claim to Mr. Young\u2019s pension rights.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-7\">While [appellant] cites <em>East v. PaineWebber, </em>131 Md.App. 302, 748 A.2d 1082 (2000) as authority that there was no waiver, this Court distinguishes that case from the present one.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-8\">The [appellant] specifically identified the future expectancy with the specified certificate number and both parties recognized Aetna Life as the handler of this account. She consented clearly to his freedom to name another beneficiary to any death benefits associated with the plan. [Appellant] knew the specific benefits, consented to changes and identified with specificity all rights that were waived.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-9\">This Court further rejects all of the other issues raised by the [appellant].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-10\">Specifically, the filing of the forms with Aetna Life Insurance constituted substantial compliance with the County Code, Article 7, Title 1A-101 through 1A-502, as the County retirement and pension system was entrusted with its Board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>of Trustees. The Board selected Aetna Life Insurance Company to administer and manage the plan and, therefore, was an authorized agent of the County.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-5\">Mr. Charles Young filed a change in beneficiary form with Aetna and complied with the necessary requirements. In fact, [appellant] in her waiver, acknowledged Aetna and allowed for any change in beneficiary with the plan. In all circumstances, the County complied with the County Code.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-6\">With regard to whether a spouse automatically becomes a beneficiary because she may be termed an annuitant, this Court finds that this designation was subject to change by Mr. Young.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-7\">With regard to whether Mr. Young was competent when entering into the contract, appellant cannot avoid the agreement as she gained the benefits under the separation agreement. Additionally, [appellant] waited over a year to raise this issue, after Mr. Young\u2019s death.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-8\">We shall include additional facts in our discussion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b578-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b578-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-11\">This appeal arises from overlapping judicial proceedings, one involving an administrative agency action and the other a declaratory action.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Although the parties have not addressed whether the declaratory action was proper in light of the administrative action, an appellate court has the \u201cauthority\u201d to raise on its own the issue of failure to exhaust statutory administrative remedies. <em>Moose v. Fraternal Order of Police, Montgomery </em>County, 369 Md. 476, 488, 800 A.2d 790 (2002). Because <em>Moose </em>suggests that there are circumstances when a declaratory action may be barred by the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies, we shall consider, preliminarily, whether the doctrine of exhaustion of administra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>tive remedies bars further consideration of the declaratory action.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\">Appellant filed the declaratory judgment action in the circuit court to resolve issues that the Board twice refused to address concerning the validity of the Agreement. The declaratory action was heard by the circuit court in the exercise of its original jurisdiction.

It added: \u201cBecause the parties had not exhausted all administrative remedies, neither the Circuit Court, nor the Court of Special Appeals, should have addressed any issues in the framework of declaratory judgment actions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Further, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-6\">At the time of appellees!\u2019] initial filing of an action in the Circuit Court, there had not been, and, in fact, as far as the record reflects, has never been to this point, a subsequent . hearing on the merits. Therefore, administrative remedies had not at that time, and never have, been exhausted. A declaratory judgment action was, therefore, not permitted at that time, or since, or now____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b583-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 483, 800 A.2d 790.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-9\">This case is altogether unlike <em>Moose. </em>Most notably, appellant did not circumvent or subvert the administrative process.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> To the contrary, appellant had two hearings before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>the Board, and she did not file the declaratory action until after the first hearing held on May 26, 1998, when the Board expressly refused to address the various issues concerning the validity of the Agreement and the change of beneficiary form. Thereafter, the circuit court stayed the declaratory action and remanded the administrative action to the Board. Although on remand the Board acknowledged that resolution of these issues could be determinative of appellant\u2019s rights, the Board refused to address the issues pertaining to the Agreement or the Decedent\u2019s competency to execute the change of beneficiary form. It said: \u201cThe Board has determined that it has no jurisdiction to determine the enforceability of a private contract .... The Board has also determined that it has no jurisdiction to determine whether Mr. Young was competent at the time the Change in Beneficiary Form was executed.\u201d Instead, it \u201cpresum[ed]\u201d the validity of both the Agreement and change of beneficiary form and then proceeded to resolve those issues that it regarded as within its domain.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">It is also noteworthy that, as a contract, the Agreement is subject to the same general rules of construction applicable to other contracts. <em>Langston v. Langston, </em>366 Md. 490, 505-06, 784 A.2d 1086 (2001); <em>Bruce v. Dyer, </em>309 Md. 421, 433, 524 A.2d 777 (1987); <em>Moore v. Moore, </em>144 Md.App. 288, 303, 797 A.2d 839 (2002); J. Fader &amp; R. Gilbert, Maryland Family Law, \u00a7 13-6(a)(2nd ed. 1995)(\u201cFader\u201d). Like other contracts, \u201c[t]he validity of a separation agreement may be determined by filing an action for declaratory relief,\u201d even without a filing for divorce. Fader, \u00a7 13-3(d)(3); <em>see Hale v. Hale, </em>66 Md.App. 228, 233-34, 503 A.2d 271 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">The court below consolidated the administrative and declaratory actions in the concurrent exercise of original and \u201cappellate\u201d jurisdiction, and issued one opinion involving both cases. <em>See Gisriel v. Ocean City Board of Supervisors of Elections, </em>345 Md. 477, 495, 693 A.2d 757 (1997) (explaining that, when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>\u00a7 12-302 of the Courts and Judicial Proceeds Article was first enacted, the circuit court\u2019s review of an agency decision was referred to as an exercise of \u201cappellate jurisdiction\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>522 U.S. 1053, 118 S.Ct. 702, 139 L.Ed.2d 645 (1998). The case of <em>Levitz Furniture Corp. v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>72 Md.App. 103, 527 A.2d 813, <em>cert. denied, </em>311 Md. 286, 533 A.2d 1308 (1987), is instructive. It involved the consolidation of two actions, one seeking judicial review of the findings of the Prince George\u2019s County Human Rights Commission (the \u201ccommission\u201d) and the other an enforcement action brought by the commission. On appeal, Judge Bloom, writing for the Court, concluded that we had jurisdiction to review the enforcement action. The Court stated, at 72 Md.App. at 108, 527 A.2d 813:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-5\">Although \u00a7 12-302(a) enables [the] County to deny its citizens the right to enlist our review of the circuit court\u2019s exercise of appellate jurisdiction, that statute does not enable the county to preclude our review of the lower court\u2019s exercise of original jurisdiction. Levitz is entitled to appeal the circuit court\u2019s judgment because it was rendered in an equity proceeding filed by the appellees in that court. <em>See </em>Md. Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc.Code Ann. \u00a7 12-301 (1984 Repl.Vol.).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b585-6\"><em>Yarema v. Exxon Corp., </em>305 Md. 219, 503 A.2d 239 (1986), is also helpful. There, the Court recognized that, \u201cunless the trial court clearly intends that a joint judgment be entered disposing of all cases simultaneously,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 236, 503 A.2d 239, consolidated cases are generally not treated as one case for the purpose of Rule 2-602. \u201c[I]nstead, each one of the cases is to be treated as <em>a </em>separate action.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">The issues that the Board considered do not \u201coverride or defeat whatever private rights exist\u201d with respect to the Agreement or the enforceability of the beneficiary form. Nor does the Board, \u201cin its workings,\u201d control the enforceability of these documents. <em>Perry v. Board of Appeals, </em>211 Md. 294, 299, 127 A.2d 507 (1956) (concerning zoning). As important as the issues concerning the Agreement and change of beneficiary form are to the ultimate resolution of this case, they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>certainly are not matters within the usual adjudicatory function of the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"AqYB\">Accordingly, we conclude that the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies does not bar our consideration of the declaratory action as to those claims concerning the validity of the Agreement or the Decedent\u2019s capacity to execute the change of beneficiary form. Nevertheless, because Counts III and IV of the declaratory action duplicate issues presented to and decided by the Board, we shall not address those claims in connection with the declaratory action.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">As a guide to our discussion of the remaining issues, we shall outline them:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-7\">1. Under the Plan, does a surviving spouse have priority over a beneficiary with regard to the recovery of pension benefits?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-8\">2. Even if the beneficiary takes priority over the surviving spouse, is the change of beneficiary form valid, given that it was filed with Aetna, rather than with the County, and it was not complete on its face?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-9\">3. If the spouse has priority as to benefits under the Plan, may a spouse, as a matter of law, waive such rights pursuant to a marital separation agreement when, as here, the pension plan is not subject to ERISA?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-10\">4. If a spouse can lawfully waive rights to benefits, is the waiver language in this Agreement sufficient to accomplish that purpose?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-11\">5. Even if a spouse can waive his or her rights to benefits by way of a separation agreement, is the Agreement in this case valid and enforceable in light of the claims of duress and mental incapacity?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b586-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-13\">We shall first focus on appellant\u2019s claim that, under the County Code, a surviving spouse takes priority over a beneficiary in regard to pension benefits. We shall also consider whether the County was entitled to consider the change of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>beneficiary form, given that it was filed with Aetna, rather than with the County.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">As the surviving spouse, appellant claims she \u201cis designated to receive the survivor\u2019s pension benefits ... at the time of the participant\u2019s death.\u201d Therefore, she contends that the Board erred in concluding, based on A.A.C.C. \u00a7 5-210(b), that benefits are paid first to the surviving beneficiary and, if the beneficiary does not survive, then to the surviving spouse, at the option of the Personnel Officer. She maintains that, under A.A.C.C. \u00a7 5 \u2014 211(f) and the \u201cstatutory design\u201d of the Plan, benefits are first payable to the participant\u2019s surviving spouse. According to Ms. Young, the beneficiary is, in effect, third in line; the beneficiary receives \u201cbenefits only after the spouse and unmarried minor children of the participant no longer are entitled to receive benefits,\u201d and then only \u201cif those events occur within five years of the date the participant ... retired under \u00a7 5-211(g).\u201d Appellant also claims that the court erred in its interpretation of the County Code when it \u201cconcluded that the designation of spouse as a beneficiary was subject to change by Mr. Young.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">In the original Designation/Change of Beneficiary Form, appellant was named as the primary beneficiary. According to appellant, under the statutory scheme, \u201cthe status of a \u2018spouse\u2019 can only be terminated by divorce or annulment, not by electing to name a different beneficiary.\u201d She adds: \u201cThe Code does not authorize a way to deprive one\u2019s spouse at [the] time of the participant\u2019s death from receiving the pension death benefits.\u201d Therefore, despite the Separation Agreement or the change of beneficiary form filed with Aetna, appellant contends that \u201cGail Young, as the \u2018spouse\u2019 of Mr. Young and so designated in the official pension file, is entitled to receive the pension benefits as a matter of law.\u201d Appellant states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-7\">Under the pension plan, the spouse of record was Gail Young. Prior to Mr. Young\u2019s death, her status was a revocable contingent interest that Mr. Young could have terminated by divorce or annulment and it was contingent on being the spouse at the date of death of Mr. Young. Her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>interest could not be eliminated by a waiver in the separation agreement absent a divorce decree incorporating the agreement. Once Mr. Young died, Gail Young had a contractual interest created. She was the spouse of record with the entitlement to receive the funds in accordance with the County pension plan. The Personnel Officer was not permitted to rely on external information to contradict this designation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">Appellant also argues that she was designated as the \u201cjoint annuitant,\u201d and therefore she is entitled to 100% of the pension benefit. In her view, \u201cthis is the status mandated by \u00a7 5 \u2014 211(f)(1) which continues for the spouse\u2019s lifetime or until she remarries.\u201d Thus, appellant asserts that the County had a contractual duty to pay her the death benefits as the spouse under \u00a7 5 \u2014 211(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">In addition, appellant contends that the County had no authority to consider the change of beneficiary form, because a Personnel Officer may not review documents outside the retirement file. She argues that, as a matter of law, \u201c[t]he Code must authorize the Personnel Officer to rely on anything outside the personnel Office official pension file.\u201d Alternatively, appellant maintains that the form was defective and thus unenforceable, because it was not fully completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">Conversely, appellee contends that, pursuant to the Separation Agreement, appellant waived her rights to benefits. Ap-pellee also argues that the Personnel Office is vested with \u201cconsiderable latitude in what materials and documents are to be used in making pension determinations.\u201d Thus, the County urges us to affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-8\">Because the issues concerning the County Code were ones that the Board considered, we pause to review the principles of judicial review of administrative agency decisions. Judicial review of an administrative agency\u2019s decision is narrow. <em>Total Audio-Visual Systems, Inc. v. Department of Labor, Licensing and Regulation, </em>360 Md. 387, 394, 758 A.2d 124 (2000); <em>United Parcel Serv., Inc. v.

Foxleigh Ent. Inc., </em>133 Md.App. 510, 514, 758 A.2d 611 (2000). Moreover, we review the decision of the agency, not the decision of the lower court. <em>Jordan Towing, Inc. v. Hebbville Auto Repair, Inc., </em>369 Md. 439, 800 A.2d 768 (2002); <em>Gigeous v. ECI, </em>363 Md. 481, 495, 769 A.2d 912 (2001); <em>Baltimore Lutheran High Sch. Ass\u2019n v. Employment Sec.

Muddiman, </em>120 Md.App. 725, 733, 708 A.2d 47 (1998). As to an agency\u2019s final decision, we consider \u201c \u2018(1) the legality of the decision and (2) whether there was substantial evidence from the record as a whole to support the decision.\u2019 \u201d <em>State Highway Admin. v. David A. Bramble, Inc., </em>351 Md. 226, 238, 717 A.2d 943 (1998)(quoting <em>Dep\u2019t. of Labor v. Hider, </em>349 Md. 71, 77-78, 706 A.2d 1073 (1998)); <em>Mayberry v. Bd. of Educ. Anne Arundel County, </em>131 Md.App. 686, 701, 750 A.2d 677 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">Factual findings made by the Board are binding upon a reviewing court, so long as they are supported by substantial evidence in the record. <em>United Parcel Serv., </em>336 Md. at 577, 650 A.2d 226; <em>Mortimer v.

Substantial evidence is defined as \u201c \u2018such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bulluck v. Pelham, Wood Apartments, </em>283 Md. 505, 512, 390 A.2d 1119 (1978) (citation omitted); <em>see Gigeous, </em>363 Md. at 497, 769 A.2d 912; <em>Wisniewski v.

In other words, the court must ask whether \u201creasoning minds could reach the same conclusion from the facts relied upon by the Board.\u201d <em>Hider, </em>349 Md. at 78, 706 A.2d 1073; <em>see Muddiman, </em>120 Md.App. at 734, 708 A.2d 47. \u201cEven if the reviewing court could have reached a different result based on the evidence before the agency, the court must uphold the agency\u2019s determination if it is rationally supported by evidence in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>record.\u201d <em>Department of Econ. and Employment Dev\u2019t v. Lilley, </em>106 Md.App. 744, 754-74, 666 A.2d 921 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">Moreover, the reviewing court \u201cmust not ... make independent findings of fact.... \u201d <em>Baltimore Lutheran, </em>302 Md. at 662, 490 A.2d 701. Rather, \u201c[b]ecause of the deference [we must] accord [to] the expertise of an administrative agency acting within the sphere of its regulated activities, we refrain from making our own independent findings of fact or substituting our judgment for that of the agency when the record contains substantial evidence supporting the agency\u2019s determination.\u201d <em>Marsheck v. Board of Trustees of Fire &amp; Police Employees\u2019 Retirement System of City of Baltimore, </em>358 Md. 393, 402, 749 A.2d 774 (2000); <em>see Jordan Towing, Inc., </em>369 Md. at 439, 450-51, 800 A.2d 768; <em>Board of Physician Quality Assurance v. Banks, </em>354 Md. 59, 68-69, 729 A.2d 376 (1999). Further, \u201cthe tasks of drawing inferences from the evidence and resolving conflicts in the evidence \u00e1re exclusively the function\u201d of the agency. <em>Motor Vehicle Administration v. Karwacki, </em>340 Md. 271, 283-84, 666 A.2d 511 (1995); <em>Board of County Comm\u2019rs v. Holbrook, </em>314 Md. 210, 218, 550 A.2d 664 (1988); <em>Westinghouse Elec. Corp. v.

Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>224 Md. 443, 168 A.2d 390 (1961), \u201c \u2018The Court may not substitute its judgment on the question whether the inference drawn is the right one or whether a different inference would be better supported. The test is reasonableness, not rightness.\u2019.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 448, 168 A.2d 390 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">In contrast, we do not defer to the agency\u2019s legal conclusions. In other words, we may always resolve whether the agency made an error of law and we are not bound by the Board\u2019s interpretation of the law. <em>Gigeous, </em>363 Md. at 496, 769 A.2d 912. Rather, \u201cwhen the question before the agency involves one of statutory interpretation or an issue of law, our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>review is more expansive.\u201d <em>Muddiman, </em>120 Md.App. at 734, 708 A.2d 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-4\">Nevertheless, the agency\u2019s decision is considered <em>prima facie </em>correct, and an appellate court must view that decision in the light most favorable to the agency. <em>Giant Food, Inc. v. Department of Labor, Licensing, and Regulation, </em>356 Md. 180, 185, 738 A.2d 856; <em>Marsheck, </em>358 Md. at 402, 749 A.2d 774; <em>Board of Education v.

Moreover, \u201c[e]ven with regard to some legal issues, a degree of deference should be accorded the position of the administrative agency.\u201d <em>Banks, </em>354 Md. at 69, 729 A.2d 376. Therefore, \u201can administrative agency\u2019s interpretation and application of the statute which the agency administers should ordinarily be given considerable weight by reviewing courts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As the <em>Banks </em>Court noted, \u201cthe expertise of the agency in its own field should be respected.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Similarly, we defer to an agency\u2019s interpretation of its own regulations. <em>Maryland Transportation Authority v. King, </em>369 Md. 274, 288, 799 A.2d 1246 (2002); <em>Division of Labor v. Triangle, </em>366 Md. 407, 416-417, 784 A.2d 534 (2001); <em>Marzullo v.

The Plan is administered by a \u201cPersonnel Officer.\u201d A.A.C.C. \u00a7 5-104(a). The Personnel Officer possesses \u201cpowers necessary for proper administration of the plan.\u201d A.A.C.C. \u00a7 o-104(b). Under \u00a7 5-104(b)(1) \u2014 (5), the Personnel Officer has the power:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-6\">(1) to prescribe procedures to be followed by employees in filing application for benefits and for furnishing of evidence necessary to establish employees\u2019 right to benefits;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-7\">(2) to make determination as to the rights of an employee applying for or receiving retirement benefits and to afford a mechanism for adjusting the complaint of an employee dissatisfied with the determination;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-8\">(3) to develop procedures for determining services of employees, and after affording employees an opportunity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>after written notice to make objection with respect to the procedures, to establish service in advance of retirement;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-5\">(4) to authorize disbursements from the pension fund in accordance with the\u2019 plan and to establish necessary procedures for authorizing disbursements; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-6\">(5) to establish policies and standards and make determinations concerning total and permanent disability for the purposes of this title.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-7\">A.A.C.C. \u00a7 5-207 is also pertinent. It provides:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-8\">\u00a7 5-207. Contingent annuitant option.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-9\">If a participant at the time of retirement does not have an eligible spouse or minor child, the participant may elect to receive pension benefits of actuarially equivalent value under the contingent annuitant option by filing written notice with the Personnel Officer prior to the participant\u2019s normal retirement date. If the election of this optional form is in effect on the participant\u2019s normal retirement date, the participant shall receive a reduced amount of pension benefits during the participant\u2019s lifetime and following the participant\u2019s death a pension benefit shall be continued and paid for life to the participant\u2019s surviving contingent annuitant, in the same reduced amount, or two-thirds or 50% of the benefit if so specified in the election; but if the participant dies during the five-year period immediately following the participant\u2019s date of retirement, pension payments which become payable to the contingent annuitant during the balance of the five-year period shall be in the same yearly amount as the pension payments which were payable to the participant____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-10\">A.A.C.C. \u00a7 5-210 is titled \u201cBeneficiaries.\u201d It states:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-11\">\u00a7 5-210.

On the other hand, the plain meaning rule is \u201celastic, rather than cast in stone[,]\u201d and if \u201cpersuasive evidence exists outside the plain text of the statute, [pertaining to the meaning of a provision,] we do not turn a blind eye to it.\u201d <em>Adamson, </em>359 Md. at 251, 753 A.2d 501.

In addition, we may also consider \u201c \u2018the consequences resulting from one meaning rather than another, and adopt that construction which avoids an illogical or unreasonable result, or one which is inconsistent with common sense.\u2019 \u201d <em>Chesapeake Charter, Inc. v.

Therefore, when reconciling a specific and a general provision of a statute, a court should give effect to the specific provision in its entirety, while retaining as much of the general provision as is reasonably possible. <em>See </em>1A Norman L. Singer, Sutherland Statutes and Statutory Construction \u00a7\u00a7 23.06, 23.09, 23.16 (5th ed.1993); <em>see also Farmers &amp; Merchants National Bank of Hagerstown v.

It said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-6\">Mr. Young filed a change of beneficiary notice on a form provided by Aetna, the paid payer of benefits to the County\u2019s retirees. The Board finds that this form, since it was supplied to the participant by Aetna, meets the requirement that the form be satisfactory to the Personnel Officer. <em>See, id. </em>The Board also finds that Mr. Young properly filed the form since it was delivered to Aetna. The Board requires that the designation of spouses and beneficiaries be filed with the Personnel Officer. <em>See, id., </em>Section 5-210(a). Aet-na is the county\u2019s agent for purposes of administering the pension program. The correspondence regarding the plan is generated by Aetna. The participants in the plan deal with Aetna. The Board finds that the requirement that the forms be filed with the Personnel Officer is met when a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>participant files the form -with Aetna, as agent for the County.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-4\">The most recent designation/change of beneficiary form filed by Mr. Young reflected that the beneficiary of his pension is Susan K. Grier, the sister of Mr. Young. The Separation Agreement states that Mr. Young, \u201cmay name any beneficiary to any death benefits associated with\u201d his Aetna annuity. The Board finds that together these items constitute a proper designation of beneficiary by Mr. Young.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">With respect to whether a Personnel Officer may consider information in Aetna\u2019s file, such as the Agreement and the change in beneficiary form, each side relies on the County Code\u2019s silence. We disagree with appellant that the Code\u2019s silence on this issue means that the Personnel Officer was barred from reviewing the change of beneficiary form because it was filed with Aetna. <em>Cf. Allfirst v. Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, </em>140 Md.App. 334, 780 A.2d 440 (2001) (determining that the absence of a statutory provision in Health General Article \u00a7 19-337, expressly permitting the collection of attorneys\u2019 fees, did not mean that a party was barred from seeking attorneys\u2019 fees). If the County wanted to prohibit the Personnel Officer from reviewing documents affecting the rights of a Plan participant or his heirs, it would have said so. Moreover, \u00a7 5-104(b) states that the \u201cPersonnel Officer has the powers <em>necessary for proper administration of the plan, including </em>\u201d the five duties mentioned earlier. Notably, the County Code does not limit the Personnel Officer\u2019s authority to the five enumerated powers; instead, it lists several examples of actions considered necessary to the proper administration of the Plan. Therefore, we are persuaded that the Personnel Officer was permitted to administer the Plan in a way he or she deemed \u201cnecessary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">That the Decedent filed a form with Aetna that the County could consider does not mean that the beneficiary named in that form necessarily had priority with respect to the receipt of benefits. A.A.C.C. \u00a7 5-210 is titled \u201cBeneficiaries,\u201d while \u00a7 5-211 specifically concerns \u201cDeath benefits.\u201d Section 5-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>210(b) seems to favor the County\u2019s position that a beneficiary has priority over a surviving spouse in regard to benefits under the Plan, while \u00a7 5-211 suggests that a spouse has priority.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">In its Memorandum of Opinion of August 11, 1999, the Board concluded that \u201cthe Personnel Officer rightfully denied\u201d appellant\u2019s request for pension benefits. It reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A6A\">Participants in the County\u2019s pension program may change the designated beneficiary. <em>See, </em>Anne Arundel County Code (the \u201cCode\u201d), Article 7, Pension Plans, Section 5-210(b).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-6\">The pension plan clearly favors the payment of benefits to the named \u201cbeneficiary\u201d over payments to a \u201cspouse.\u201d Only if no name has been filed or if the named beneficiary does not survive the participant are the benefits permitted to be paid to others. <em>See, id., </em>Section 5-210(b). The benefits that would have been paid to the named beneficiary can then be paid, \u201cat the option of the Personnel Officer to either the participant\u2019s surviving spouse, the participant\u2019s surviving children in equal shares, or the executor or administrator of the participant.\u201d <em>See, id.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-7\">The Board notes, however, that if the Circuit Court determines that Ms. Young did not waive her rights to Mr. Young\u2019s pension in th Separation Agreement and the Change of Beneficiary From is invalid due to Ms. Young\u2019s incompetence then Ms. Young may be entitled to Mr. Young\u2019s pension benefits. Unfortunately, this Board has no jurisdiction to decide such matters.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">Noticeably absent from the Board\u2019s opinion is any reference to \u00a7 5-211. Nor did the Board reconcile the apparent inconsistency between \u00a7 5-211 and \u00a7 5-210. A.A.C.C. \u00a7 5 \u2014 211(f) and (g) refer to the circumstances under which death benefits are payable to the spouse, unmarried minor children, and, last, to the beneficiary. Subsection 5-211(f)(2) states that if the spouse who is receiving payments either <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>remarries or dies, and if there are surviving, unmarried minor children, then the minor children would recover the remainder of the benefits until they reach adulthood. Under \u00a7 5-211(f)(3), if there is no surviving spouse, then the unmarried, minor children receive the benefits until they reach the age of majority. Section 5-211(g) provides that a beneficiary is entitled to receive the death benefits if there is no surviving spouse <em>and </em>no surviving, unmarried minor child <em>and </em>the claim is asserted within five years of the participant\u2019s retirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">With respect to A.A.C.C. \u00a7 5-211, then, the rights of a beneficiary come into play only when there is no eligible spouse or child. The language of this section plainly provides that a beneficiary\u2019s rights follow those of the surviving spouse or minor children. Therefore, we agree with appellant that \u201c[i]t is only after considering this classification of unmarried minor children that under subsection 5-211(g), a \u2018beneficiary\u2019 is considered for payment of the death benefit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">We note, too, that \u00a7 5 \u2014 211 (f) provides that benefits <em>shall </em>be paid to the spouse if no contingent annuitant is elected. Section 5-211(f)(l) appears to be a firm directive with respect to pension payments. Ordinarily, the term \u201cshall\u201d \u201cindicates a mandatory intent, unless the context of the statute indicates otherwise.\u201d <em>Burch v. State, </em>358 Md. 278, 284, 747 A.2d 1209 (2000); <em>see In Re Anthony R., </em>362 Md. 51, 60, 763 A.2d 136 (2000); <em>In Re Abiagail C., </em>138 Md.App. 570, 581, 772 A.2d 1277 (2001) (\u201cDepending on the context, placement, and use of the word \u2018shall,\u2019 and the nature of the constitutional provision or statute in which it appears, the word may have a mandatory connotation, so as to require that the action that \u2018shall\u2019 be done must be done, or may be directory in meaning, so as to exhort the doing of the thing that \u2018shall\u2019 be done without requiring it.\u201d); <em>Branch v. McGeeney, </em>123 Md.App. 330, 356, 718 A.2d 631 (1998); <em>Witt v. Ristaino, </em>118 Md.App. 155, 172, 701 A.2d 1227 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">We conclude that the Board\u2019s reliance on A.A.C.C. \u00a7 5-210(b) was misplaced. Looking at the statutory scheme as a whole, and recognizing that a specific provision (Death Bene<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>fits) prevails over a general provision (Beneficiaries), the specific enactment applies. Therefore, the Decedent\u2019s filing of a change of beneficiary form did not defeat appellant\u2019s claim as a surviving spouse. Put another way, even if the change of beneficiary form filed with Aetna was valid, it did not give priority to the beneficiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">In light of our resolution of these issues, we need not determine whether the Decedent was competent when he executed the change of beneficiary form. We also decline to consider appellant\u2019s claim that the change of beneficiary form was invalid because it was incomplete.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">If a surviving spouse takes priority over a beneficiary under the Plan, the question arises as to whether the Separation Agreement vitiated appellant\u2019s statutory rights. According to appellant, her \u201cstatus as spouse at the time of Mr. Young\u2019s death ... is the contingency that gives her the contractual right to receive the pension,\u201d and only by divorce could she \u201chave ended the contingency.\u201d Appellant maintains that the County \u201cCode does not authorize a way to deprive one\u2019s spouse at [the] time of the participant\u2019s death from receiving the pension death benefits. In the statutory design of the County Code, the status as \u2018spouse\u2019 can only be terminated by divorce or annulment....\u201d Thus, under A.A.C.C. \u00a7 5-211(1), appellant maintains that the Separation Agreement is \u201cirrelevant,\u201d and she is \u201centitled to the death benefits as a matter of law,\u201d given that she was not divorced from Mr. Young when he died.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-8\">We reject appellant\u2019s broad contention that a spouse cannot voluntarily waive his or her rights to pension benefits under the County Plan. In this regard, we note the absence in the statutory scheme of an express prohibition of a contractual waiver as to pension benefits. <em>Cf. Allfirst, </em>140 Md.App. at 372, 780 A.2d 440 (noting that, if the Legislature wanted to prohibit certain conduct under a statute, \u201cit would have said so.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>Congress enacted a comprehensive federal scheme for the protection of pension plan participants and their beneficiaries (\u201cERISA\u201d). <em>See Stewart v.

ERISA requires all plans within its scope to include anti-assignment provisions. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1056(d)(1) provides: \u201cEach pension plan shall provide the benefits provided under the plan may not be assigned or alienated.\u201d Under the Retirement Equity Act of 1984, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 417, the only exception to the anti-assignment provision of 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1056(d)(1) is a state qualified domestic relations order that meets the requirements of 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1056(d)(3)(A). <em>Stewart, </em>207 F.3d at 1148-49. ERISA also places considerable limitations upon a plan administrator with respect to what documents can be considered in making pension determinations. The parties acknowledge, however, that the County\u2019s Plan is exempt from ERISA. Therefore, appellant\u2019s reliance on <em>Metropolitan Life Insurance Company v. Pettit, </em>164 F.3d 857 (4th Cir.1998), is misplaced. In that case, the court determined that a marital separation agreement could not alter the beneficiary designation under a pension plan, because it was \u201can outside agreement.\u201d Nevertheless, the rationale of the case turned on the fact that the plan was subject to ERISA; this Plan is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\"><em>Estate of Thomas Angelo Altobelli v. International Business Machines Corp., </em>77 F.3d 78 (4th Cir.1996), is instructive. There, a married employee of IBM participated in the company\u2019s pension and life insurance plan. According to the terms of the pension plan, if the participant failed to designate a beneficiary, the beneficiary of the life insurance plan became a \u201cdefault beneficiary\u201d of the pension plan. Some time later, the employee and his wife divorced and disposed of their property according to the terms of a settlement agreement that provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-6\">\u201c \u2018All of the following property is hereafter the sole and exclusive property of the Husband, and the wife hereby waives and transfers to the Husband any interest that she may have in the property:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>(g) Husband\u2019s IBM pension and other deferred compensation plans, if any.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b605-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 79 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">Nonetheless, the ex-wife was a \u201cdefault beneficiary,\u201d according to the terms of the employee\u2019s plan, as the husband failed to designate a new beneficiary. Thus, upon the death of the employee, IBM sought to distribute the proceeds of the pension plan to the former wife, claiming that it \u201cmust administer the pension plans only according to their terms, without regard to the separation agreement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Fourth Circuit determined that the ex-wife had waived all rights to the plan, and therefore the benefits were payable to the husband\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">The court considered whether a deceased employee\u2019s beneficiary could alienate his or her rights to the benefits of an ERISA governed pension plan, pursuant to a settlement agreement. Although ERISA contemplates an \u201canti-alienation\u201d clause, requiring that \u201ceach pension plan shall provide that benefits under the plan may not be assigned or alienated,\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1056(d)(l)(1988), the court determined that the clause \u201cdid not apply to a beneficiary\u2019s waiver.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 81. Rather, the provision applied to the participant of the plan, not the participant\u2019s beneficiary. <em>Id. </em>Moreover, the court determined that giving effect to a waiver embodied in a domestic relations order \u201cdid not burden plan administrators\u201d so as to violate ERISA. <em>Id. </em>The court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-8\">In this case, each party clearly intended to relinquish all interests in the pension plans of the other. Congress\u2019s provision for QDROs reveals that, in some situations, it deems the intent of the parties sufficiently important to override the policy of simplified administration. Because enforcement of a divorce agreement\u2019s specific waiver of ERISA pension-plan benefits would require no marginal infringement of that policy beyond the infringement already necessitated by the QDRO provision, and since ERISA does not directly address the issue, we join the Seventh Circuit in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>holding as a matter of federal common law that such a waiver is to be given full effect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">It follows that if the Separation Agreement is valid and enforceable, and, further, that the waiver language is legally sufficient, appellant could be bound by it. We proceed next to the question of whether the Separation Agreement is valid and enforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-8\">Even if a spouse can voluntarily elect to waive benefits, appellant claims that the t\u00e9xt of the waiver is insufficient to effect a relinquishment of her rights to the pension benefits. Appellant suggests that a sentence by sentence analysis of the waiver language reveals the deficiencies, because the waiver language is too \u201cgeneral in nature,\u201d and \u201cdoes not comply with the minimum requirements\u201d of <em>PaineWebber Inc. v. East, </em>363 Md. 408, 768 A.2d 1029 (2001). Appellant states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-9\">[Bjesides identifying the' specific account, the waiver language must specifically mention the survivorship interest or future expectancy under that account. This is where the Young waiver language of paragraph 13 is insufficient. It does not identify the survivorship interest of Gail Young that she would have upon the death of her husband. This is the contingent, future expectancy.... The language in paragraph 13 totally fails to identify the survivorship interest of Gail Young. Nor does it specifically identify that she has a future expectancy interest that exists under death benefit section as spouse or joint annuitant. Consequently, when this language of waiver under paragraph 13 is examined in detail, it is revealed to be general in nature.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-10\">Ms. Young continues:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-11\">In the instant case, the language of waiver is even less detailed. It merely states in paragraph 13 that she \u201cwaives any interest of any nature thereunder in that account.\u201d This is almost identical to the general type of waiver included in PaineWebber. Consequently, the language in-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>eluded in paragraph 18 of the Young Separation Agreement must be deemed general in nature and not specific enough to be the type of waiver that would be effective under the rules of PaineWebber.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-4\">The last sentence of paragraph 13 grants to the husband the right to name a \u201cbeneficiary\u201d to the death benefits associated with the Plan. Even if Mr. Young changed his \u201cbeneficiary,\u201d it did not change the status of Gail Young as his \u201cspouse.\u201d The Changes of Beneficiary form still identified him as \u201cmarried.\u201d As discussed supra, \u00a7 5-210 called for both the naming of a spouse and the designation of a beneficiary who would receive benefits under certain contingent conditions set out under \u00a7 5-211. Paragraph 13\u2019s sentence reasonably means that Mr. Young could name any beneficiary to the death benefit that would receive those benefits in the event that Gail Young\u2019s payments ceased, if the other statutory requirements were satisfied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">In its Memorandum Opinion and Order, the court found that the language of the waiver paragraph \u201cspecifically identified the future expectancy with the specified certificate number ...,\u201d and thus amounted to a waiver of rights. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">At the outset, we pause to review the principles of contract construction applicable to the Separation Agreement. The construction of a written contract is a question of law, subject to <em>de novo </em>review by an appellate court. <em>Langston v. Langston, </em>366 Md. 490, 505-06, 784 A.2d 1086 (2001); <em>Auction &amp; Estate Representatives, Inc. v. Ashton, </em>354 Md. 333, 341, 731 A.2d 441 (1999); <em>JBG/Twinbrook Metro Ltd. v. Wheeler, </em>346 Md. 601, 625, 697 A.2d 898 (1997). As a fundamental principle of contract construction, we seek to ascertain and effectuate the intention of the contracting parties. <em>Society of Am. Foresters v. Renewable Natural Resources Found., </em>114 Md.App. 224, 234, 689 A.2d 662 (1997); <em>Hartford Accident &amp; Indem. Co. v. Scarlett Harbor </em>Assocs. <em>Ltd. P\u2019ship, </em>109 Md.

Moreover, \u201cthe primary source for determining the intention of the parties is the language of the contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>itself.\u201d <em>Hartford Accident &amp; Indem., </em>109 Md.App. at 291, 674 A.2d 106.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\">Contracts are interpreted \u201cas a whole to determine the parties\u2019 intentions.\u201d <em>Sullins v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>340 Md. 503, 508, 667 A.2d 617 (1995). Ordinarily, the terms of a contract are construed consistent with their usual meaning, unless it is apparent that the parties ascribed a special or technical meaning to them. <em>See Fister v. Allstate Life Ins. Co., </em>366 Md. 201, 210, 783 A.2d 194 (2001); <em>Cheney v. Bell Nat\u2019l Life Ins. Co., </em>315 Md. 761, 766, 556 A.2d 1135 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">In ascertaining the parties\u2019 intent, Maryland follows the objective law of contract interpretation. <em>See Taylor v. NationsBank, N.A., </em>365 Md. 166, 178, 776 A.2d 645 (2001); <em>B &amp; P Enterprises v. Overland Equip. Co., </em>133 Md.App. 583, 604, 758 A.2d 1026 (2000). Thus, the court is required to \u201cgive effect to [the contract\u2019s] plain meaning,\u201d without regard to what the parties to the contract thought it meant or intended it to mean. <em>Wells v. Chevy Chase Bank, </em>363 Md. 232, 251, 768 A.2d 620 (2001); <em>see PaineWebber Inc., </em>363 Md. at 414, 768 A.2d 1029; <em>Ashton, </em>354 Md. at 340-41, 731 A.2d 441; <em>Calomiris v. Woods, </em>353 Md. 425, 436, 727 A.2d 358 (1999). Generally, \u201c \u2018it must be presumed that the parties meant what they expressed.\u2019 \u201d <em>PaineWebber Inc., </em>363 Md. at 414, 768 A.2d 1029 (citation omitted); <em>see Jones v. Hubbard, </em>356 Md. 513, 534, 740 A.2d 1004 (1999). Therefore, the \u201c \u2018true test of what is meant is ... what a reasonable person in the position of the parties would have thought\u2019 the contract meant.\u201d <em>Society of Am. Foresters, </em>114 Md.App. at 234, 689 A.2d 662 (citation omitted). \u201c \u2018If only one reasonable meaning can be ascribed to the [contract] when viewed in context, that meaning necessarily reflects the parties\u2019 intent.\u2019 \u201d <em>Labor Ready v. Abis, </em>137 Md.App. 116, 128, 767 A.2d 936 (2001) (citation omitted). In addition, \u201cthe parties to an agreement are deemed to have contracted with knowledge of existing law....\u201d <em>Heyda v. Heyda, </em>94 Md.App. 91, 98, 615 A.2d 1218 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">When a contract is clear and unambiguous, \u201c \u2018its construction is for the court to determine.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wells, </em>363 Md. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>251, 768 A.2d 620 (citation omitted). Whether a contract is ambiguous is a question of law, which is subject to <em>de novo </em>review by an appellate court. <em>Calomiris, </em>353 Md. at 434, 727 A.2d 358. Contractual language is considered ambiguous when the words in it are susceptible of more than one meaning to a reasonably prudent person. <em>Ashton, </em>354 Md. at 340, 731 A.2d 441; <em>Calomiris, </em>353 Md. at 436, 727 A.2d 358; <em>Davis v. Magee, </em>140 Md.App. 635, 650, 782 A.2d 351 (2001). A contract is not ambiguous, however, merely because the parties to it do not agree as to its meaning. <em>Fultz v. Shaffer, </em>111 Md.App. 278, 298, 681 A.2d 568 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">To determine if contractual language is susceptible of more than one meaning, a court reviews the contract itself. <em>University of Baltimore v. Iz, </em>123 Md.App. 135, 162, 716 A.2d 1107, <em>cert. denied, </em>351 Md. 663, 719 A.2d 1262 (1998). It must also consider \u201cthe character of the contract, its purpose, and the facts and circumstances of the parties at the time of the execution.\u201d <em>Pacific Indem. Co. v. Interstate Fire &amp; Cas. Co., </em>302 Md. 383, 388, 488 A.2d 486 (1985). But, it is not the province of the court to rewrite an agreement to rectify an ambiguity, to avoid hardship to a party, or because one party has become dissatisfied with its terms. <em>Bailer v. Erie Ins. Exchange, </em>344 Md. 515, 539, 687 A.2d 1375 (1997); <em>Canaras v. Lift Truck Services, Inc., </em>272 Md. 337, 350, 322 A.2d 866 (1974); <em>Fultz, </em>111 Md.App. at 298, 681 A.2d 568.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\"> When the trial court finds a contract ambiguous, the trial court may receive parol evidence to clarify its meaning. <em>Bushey v. Northern Assurance, </em>362 Md. 626, 632, 766 A.2d 598 (2001); <em>Sullins, </em>340 Md. at 508, 667 A.2d 617. If the appellate court agrees with the trial court\u2019s finding of ambiguity, \u201cit will apply a clearly erroneous standard to the trial court\u2019s assessment of the construction of the contract in light of the parol evidence received.\u201d <em>Calomiris, </em>353 Md. at 435, 727 A.2d 358.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\"><em>PaineWebber, </em>363 Md. at 408, 768 A.2d 1029, is pertinent. There, the Court addressed whether a provision in a divorce settlement was enforceable as a waiver of a former wife\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>interest in the proceeds of her ex-husband\u2019s Individual Retirement Account (\u201cIRA\u201d). Under the terms of the IRA, the husband initially designated his wife as the beneficiary. Four years later, the parties executed a separation agreement, and they divorced the following year. The husband subsequently remarried and died three years later. At the time of death, the ex-wife remained the named beneficiary of the account. As a result, the ex-wife sued PaineWebber, seeking, to recover the proceeds of the account, to which the decedent\u2019s estate also claimed entitlement. PaineWebber, joined by the husband\u2019s estate and widow, argued that the separation agreement included a \u201cpension waiver\u201d that foreclosed the ex-wife\u2019s claim to the retirement funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">The provision of the settlement agreement, entitled \u201cPension Waiver,\u201d stated, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-6\">Each of the parties hereby expressly waives any legal right either may have under any Federal or State law as a spouse to participate as a payee or beneficiary regarding any interests the other may have in any pension plan, profit-sharing plan, or any other form of retirement or deferred income plan including, but not limited to, the right either spouse may have to receive any benefit, in the form of a lump-sum death benefit, joint or survivor annuity, or pre-retirement survivor annuity pursuant to any State or Federal law, and each of the parties hereby expressly consents to any election made by the other, now or at any time hereafter, with respect to the recipient and the form of payment of any benefit upon retirement or death under any such pension plan, profit-sharing plan, or other form of retirement or deferred income plan.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b610-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 415, 768 A.2d 1029.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-8\">Based on the waiver language, the trial court granted summary judgment to the estate, widow, and PaineWebber. We reversed. <em>East v. PaineWebber Inc., </em>131 Md.App. 302, 748 A.2d 1082 (2000). Regarding the issue of whether the ex-wife waived her right as a beneficiary to the IRA, we concluded that the language was insufficient to effect a waiver, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>because it did not specifically identify the \u201cfuture expectancy.\u201d We said, at 131 Md.App. at 315-16, 748 A.2d 1082:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-5\">[W]e believe that the Agreement\u2019s general waiver language is insufficient to terminate [the ex-wife\u2019s] rights as beneficiary to the East IRA. Not only did it fail specifically to mention the East IRA, it wholly failed to mention the waiver of any survivorship interest or future expectancy. Without more, we do not believe that, by executing the Agreement with general waiver language, [the ex-wife] waived her rights as a beneficiary to the East IRA. In order to do so, we believe it necessary that the language of the separation agreement clearly provide for waiver of future expectancy interests.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">The Court of Appeals agreed that the language in the pension waiver provision did \u201cnot support a finding that [the ex-wife] waived her rights as beneficiary to the East IRA.\u201d <em>PaineWebber Inc. v. East, </em>363 Md. at 416, 768 A.2d 1029. The Court reasoned, at 363 Md. at 415-16, 768 A.2d 1029:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-7\">It has not been determined ... who the named beneficiary is. If no change of beneficiary was effected by [the husband], then [the ex-wife\u2019s] consent to a change is simply irrelevant. The Estate\u2019s consent argument improperly assumes that the named beneficiary of the East IRA was validly and effectively changed. If the beneficiary has been effectively changed, it is pursuant to a power reserved in [the husband] to which [the ex-wife\u2019s] consent was not required....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-8\">Furthermore, [the ex-wife] does not claim the East IRA based on status or relationship as a spouse; she claims under a contract right, as the named beneficiary. Thus, the language waiving \u201cany legal right ... as a spouse to participate as a payee or beneficiary ... in any ... retirement or deferred income plan\u201d does not defeat [the ex-wife\u2019s] claim. We agree with the conclusion of the Court of Special Appeals that \u201cthe \u2018Pension Waiver\u2019 provision of the Agreement does not support a finding that Carol waived her rights as a beneficiary to the East IRA.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b612-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>Our decision in <em>Heineman v. Bright, </em>140 Md.App. 658, 782 A.2d 365 (2001), is also instructive. There, the widow of a deceased company employee filed a complaint seeking to declare her rights to the company\u2019s Defined Benefit Plan and Trust (\u201cTrust\u201d). The husband\u2019s estate and ex-wife argued that the ex-wife waived her rights to the Trust in a prenuptial agreement. The relevant portion of the agreement stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"apz-dedup-0\">The parties hereby expressly waive any legal right either may have under any Federal or state law as a spouse to participate as a payee or beneficiary under any interest the other may have in any pension plan, profit sharing plan, or any other form of retirement or deferred income plan, including, but not limited to, the right either spouse may have to receive any benefit in the form of a lump sum death benefit, joint or survivor annuity or pre-retirement survivor annuity pursuant to any state or Federal Law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b612-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 662, 782 A.2d 365.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">Additionally, the parties disclosed the corresponding property interests in a \u201cSchedule\u201d attached to the prenuptial agreement. The husband specifically listed \u201cDefined Benefit IRA\u201d as an asset, which incorporated the Trust in issue. Relying on <em>PaineWebber, </em>the ex-wife asserted that the prenuptial agreement did not foreclose her rights to the Trust. We noted that the ex-wife failed to address the issue in the court below, but indicated that, even if she had, we would have determined that she waived any claim to the Trust in her prenuptial agreement. Unlike in <em>PaineWebber, </em>we noted that the prenuptial agreement specifically listed the property in question. Moreover, the ex-wife waived any \u201crights as a spouse\u201d to the Trust. Consequently, we concluded that she was not entitled to any benefits under the pension plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">Based on the foregoing authorities, and assuming the Agreement is valid and enforceable, we are unpersuaded by appellant\u2019s argument that the waiver language in the Agreement is too general to accomplish a waiver of benefits. Paragraph 13 specifically refers to the Decedent\u2019s ownership of the annuity, \u201cavailable to him through his former employer, Anne <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>Arundel County, Maryland.\u201d Moreover, it expressly indicates that the \u201cannuity is handled by Aetna Life Insurance Company under Certificate # 164340273.\u201d It also provides that the wife is familiar with the benefits associated with this account, and \u201cwaives any interest of any nature\u201d in the account. Similarly, \u00b6 13a identifies appellant\u2019s interest in two retirement plans, which were rolled over into an IRA account and a separate \u201cVested Life Annuity\u201d account with Blue Cross of Maryland. Mr. Young \u201cwaive[d] any interest of any nature thereunder in those accounts or any successor accounts thereto.\u201d Accordingly, we conclude that the waiver language is sufficient to accomplish a waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">Appellant claims the court erred in granting summary judgment to the County with respect to her various challenges to the validity of the Agreement. She claims the Separation Agreement is void and unenforceable because she was \u201cunder duress\u201d and \u201cwas coerced at the time she signed the Separation Agreement,\u201d and had a \u201cdiminished capacity.\u201d To that end, she contends that she signed the Agreement because the Griers threatened that she would not see her husband again unless she did so. Further, she asserts that the circuit court erred in granting the County\u2019s summary judgment motion because it precluded her \u201cfrom developing these arguments through discovery and presentation of facts supporting these claims.\u201d The County maintains that appellant could not challenge the Agreement based on the Decedent\u2019s incapacity. As best we can determine, it did not address the duress claim below.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">As we indicated, notwithstanding the claims of duress, coercion, and incapacity, the Board presumed the validity of the Agreement and change of beneficiary form. It also said that, in the absence of a valid Agreement and change of beneficiary form, appellant would be entitled to recover the pension benefits. In effect, then, the presumed validity of the Agreement was a critical component of the Board\u2019s decision; if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>Agreement were found to be invalid due to duress, coercion, or incapacity, appellant might then be entitled to recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">No discovery was ever conducted on the issue of duress. Nor is it clear whether full discovery was conducted-as to the Decedent\u2019s capacity, although appellant asserted that \u201cfactual disputes\u201d existed in regard to execution of the Agreement. The circuit court ruled that because appellant \u201cgained the benefits\u201d under the Agreement, and waited too long to complain, she could not \u201cavoid the [A]greement\u201d on that ground. The court also upheld the waiver language in the Agreement as legally sufficient, without specifically addressing the issue of duress or the standard for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">Appellant complains that the trial court \u201cerroneously applied the standard of review as if this was solely an appeal from the Board of Appeals.\u201d She asserts, among other things, that the court \u201cfailed to ... determine whether there were disputes of fact that required a trial.\u201d In regard to the claims raised in the declaratory judgment action concerning the validity of the Agreement, appellant maintains that issues of duress, mental capacity, and consideration involve disputed questions of fact, yet she had \u201cno opportunity to conduct discover[y] on these issues.\u201d Appellee has not addressed these contentions in its brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">At this juncture, we pause to observe that summary judgment is permissible in a declaratory action. <em>Megonnell v. United States Auto. Ass\u2019n, </em>368 Md. 633, 642, 796 A.2d 758 (2002). But, it is \u201c \u2018 \u201cthe exception rather than the rul\u00e9.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>McBriety v. Commissioners of Cambridge, </em>127 Md.App. 59, 65, 732 A.2d 296 (1999) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-8\">Maryland Rule 2-501 establishes a two-part test for summary judgment. In deciding a motion for summary judgment, the trial court must decide whether there are any genuine disputes of material fact and, if not, whether either party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Jones v. Mid-Atlantic Funding Co., </em>362 Md. 661, 675-76, 766 A.2d 617 (2001); <em>Okwa v. Harper, </em>360 Md. 161, 178, 757 A.2d 118 (2000); <em>Beatty v. Trailmaster Products, Inc., </em>330 Md. 726, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>737-38, 625 A.2d 1005 (1993); <em>Philadelphia Indemn. Ins. Co. v. Maryland Yacht Club, Inc., </em>129 Md.App. 455, 465, 742 A.2d 79 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">We review, <em>de novo, </em>an order granting summary judgment. <em>Tyma v. Montgomery County, </em>369 Md. 497, 801 A.2d 148 (2002); <em>Green v. H &amp; R Block, Inc., </em>355 Md. 488, 502, 735 A.2d 1039 (1999). Our task is to determine if the trial court reached the correct legal result. <em>Murphy v. Merzbacher, </em>346 Md. 525, 530-31, 697 A.2d 861 (1997); <em>Goodwich v. Sinai Hosp. of Baltimore, Inc., </em>343 Md. 185, 204, 680 A.2d 1067 (1996). This requires us to undertake the same analysis as the trial court; we evaluate the identical material from the record, and decide the same legal issues presented to the circuit court. <em>Lopata v. Miller, </em>122 Md.App. 76, 83, 712 A.2d 24, <em>cert. denied, </em>351 Md. 286, 718 A.2d 234 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">To defeat a claim for summary judgment, the party opposing the motion must produce evidence demonstrating a genuine dispute of material fact. <em>Scroggins v. Dahne, </em>335 Md. 688, 691, 645 A.2d 1160 (1994); <em>Berringer v. Steele, </em>133 Md.App. 442, 470, 758 A.2d 574 (2000). A material fact is one that will alter the outcome of the case, depending upon how the factfinder resolves the dispute. <em>King v. Bankerd, </em>303 Md. 98, 111, 492 A.2d 608 (1985); <em>Faith v. Keefer, </em>127 Md.App. 706, 734, 736 A.2d 422, <em>cert. denied, </em>357 Md. 191, 742 A.2d 521 (1999). Mere general allegations or conclusory assertions of a disputed fact will not suffice. <em>Beatty, </em>330 Md. at 738, 625 A.2d 1005. Rather, the party who opposes summary judgment must present the court with facts \u201cin detail and with precision.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">In considering a summary judgment motion, the trial court must resolve all factual disputes, including reasonable inferences drawn from the facts, in favor of the non-moving party. <em>Frederick Rd. Ltd. P\u2019ship v. Brown &amp; Sturm, </em>360 Md. 76, 94, 756 A.2d 963 (2000); <em>Dobbins v. Washington Suburban Sanitary Comm\u2019n, </em>338 Md. 341, 345, 658 A.2d 675 (1995); <em>Electronics Store, Inc. v. Cellco P\u2019ship, </em>127 Md.App. 385, 395, 732 A.2d 980, <em>cert. denied, </em>356 Md. 495, 740 A.2d 613 (1999). Furthermore, the trial court may not determine the credibility <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>of witnesses. <em>Impala Platinum, Ltd. v. Impala Sales (U.S.A.), Inc., </em>283 Md. 296, 329, 389 A.2d 887 (1978); <em>Thacker v. City of Hyattsville, </em>135 Md.App. 268, 286, 762 A.2d 172 (2000) . When, as here, both sides file cross-motions for summary judgment, it does not necessarily follow that the court must grant summary judgment. <em>See Regal Savings Bank v. Sachs, </em>352 Md. 356, 372, 722 A.2d 377 (1999). Undisputed facts may give rise to conflicting inferences that are not appropriate for resolution by summary judgment. <em>Id. </em>Summary judgment is not a substitute for trial. <em>Mayor and City Council of Baltimore v. Ross, </em>365 Md. 351, 359, 779 A.2d 380 (2001) .</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">Even if the facts are undisputed, the appellate court must still determine whether the trial court accurately interpreted the applicable law and correctly applied it to the undisputed facts. <em>Fister v. Allstate Life Ins. Co., </em>366 Md. at 210, 783 A.2d 194. Ordinarily, we will uphold the grant of summary judgment \u201conly on the grounds relied upon by the trial court.\u201d <em>Blades v. Woods, </em>338 Md. 475, 478, 659 A.2d 872 (1995); <em>see Gross v. Sussex, </em>332 Md. 247, 254 n. 3, 630 A.2d 1156 (1993); <em>Hoffman v. United Iron and Metal Co., </em>108 Md.App. 117, 132-33, 671 A.2d 55 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-8\">Ms. Young is correct that in its opinion the circuit court discussed the standard of review as to administrative agencies, but did not mention the summary judgment standard. Nor did the court state that there were no disputes of material fact. We are satisfied, however, that the court was well aware that it had before it cross-motions for summary judgment in both cases. In its ruling, the court stated: \u201c[T]his case reaches the Court on Cross Motions for Summary Judgment.\u201d Similarly, in its Order, the court denied appellant\u2019s summary judgment motion and granted the cross-motion of appellee. The failure to mention the summary judgment standard in the opinion certainly does not establish that the court did not know the proper standard. <em>Cf. Uninsured Employers\u2019 Fund v. Pennel, </em>133 Md.App. 279, 754 A.2d 1120 (2000) (noting that circuit court articulated an improper standard of review of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>decision of Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission, but concluding that court actually applied the correct principles to the undisputed facts).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">Nevertheless, we agree with appellant that the court erred in granting summary judgment as to the claims of duress and capacity. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">As the Court said in <em>Gordon v. Gordon, </em>342 Md. 294, 300, 675 A.2d 540 (1996), \u201c[t]he prevailing view is now that \u2018separation agreements ... are generally favored by the courts as a peaceful means of terminating marital strife and discord so long as they are not contrary to public policy.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 300-301, 675 A.2d 540 (citation omitted). Because a separation agreement is a contract, the general principles of contract analysis apply. <em>See Langston, </em>366 Md. at 505-506, 784 A.2d 1086; <em>Moore, </em>144 Md.App. 288, 306-08, 797 A.2d 839; <em>see also Calabi v. Government Employees Ins. Co., </em>353 Md. 649, 653, 728 A.2d 206 (1999) (recognizing that a settlement agreement is a type of contract).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">Mutual assent is an essential element with respect to the formation of a valid contract. <em>Creel v. Lilly, </em>354 Md. 77, 101, 729 A.2d 385 (1999); <em>Safeway Stores Inc. v. Altman, </em>296 Md. 486, 489, 463 A.2d 829 (1983); <em>Mitchell v. AARP, </em>140 Md.App. 102, 117, 779 A.2d 1061 (2001). As with other contracts, a separation agreement is voidable, and subject to recision, if it can be shown that it was unconscionable or procured through fraud, duress, or undue influence. <em>Hale v. Hale, </em>74 Md.App. 555, 572, 539 A.2d 247 (1988); <em>Hale, </em>66 Md.App. at 233, 503 A.2d 271; <em>Blum v. Blum, </em>59 Md.App. 584, 594, 477 A.2d 289 (1984); <em>Saggese v. Saggese, </em>15 Md.App. 378, 388, 290 A.2d 794 (1972). When a party\u2019s agreement to contract is \u201cforced or involuntary, he will not be bound by that commitment.\u201d <em>Blum, </em>59 Md.App. at 594, 477 A.2d 289. As we observed, a declaratory judgment action is a proper vehicle to determine the validity of a contract, including a marital separation agreement. <em>See Hale, </em>66 Md.App. at 233-34, 503 A.2d 271; <em>see Fader, </em>\u00a7 13-3(d)(3), at 560.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>What the <em>Blum </em>Court said as to duress and undue influence is pertinent here.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-4\">Duress, fraud or undue influence may be the basis to avoid a property settlement. To establish duress there must be a wrongful act which strips the individual of the ability to utilize his free will.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-5\">A condition precedent to the right to rescind requires that the party against whom relief is sought be restored substantially to the position which he held before the termination was completed. Put another way, a party may not affirm the favorable part and avoid the unfavorable part.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b618-6\"><em>Blum, </em>59 Md.App. at 594, 477 A.2d 289 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">The <em>Blum </em>Court also elucidated the meaning of duress in the context of voidable contracts, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-8\">Duress which permits avoidance of a contract consists of the use of coercion, the victim\u2019s loss of the ability to act independently and the entry by the victim into the contract. The burden of proving each and every one of these elements remains with the person seeking to set aside the contract. When a confidential relationship has been shown to exist, however, the burden is upon the dominant party to establish that the agreement was fair in all respects. There is no presumption that the husband is the dominant partner in the marriage. Since that presumption does not apply, whether there is a confidential relationship becomes a question of fact.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-9\">It. has been said that absent proof of a confidential relationship, agreements not disclosing any injustice on their face[,] are presumptively valid. This proposition has been generally accepted and applied. The obverse, namely that agreements disclosing injustice on their face are presumptively invalid, has had very limited application to property settlements. The added factor of a confidential relationship has not altered the results.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>Blum, 59 Md.App. at 595, 477 A.2d 289 (internal citations omitted); <em>see also Baran v. Jaskulski, </em>114 Md.App. 322, 333, 689 A.2d 1283 (1997) (persons who, with counsel, enter contracts as to marital property are generally \u201cleft in the condition in which they placed themselves,\u201d absent undue influence.); <em>Holmes v. Coverall North America, Inc., </em>98 Md.App. 519, 529, 633 A.2d 932 (1993) (\u201c \u2018Grounds in equity or law for revocation of a contract include an allegation that the contract is void for lack of mutual consent, consideration or capacity or voidable for fraud, duress, lack of capacity, mistake, or violation of a public purpose.\u2019 \u201d) (Citation omitted); <em>Eckstein v. Eckstein, </em>38 Md.App. 506, 511, 379 A.2d 757 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">The Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 175 (1981), also provides guidance as to the concept of duress. It states:</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">\u00a7 175 When Duress by Threat Makes a Contract Voidable</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-7\">(1) If a party\u2019s manifestation of assent is induced by an improper threat by the other party that leaves the victim no reasonable alternative, the contract is voidable by the victim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-8\">(2) If a party\u2019s manifestation of assent is induced by one who is not a party to the transaction, the contract is voidable by the victim unless the other party to the transaction in good faith and without reason to know of the duress either gives value or relies materially on the transaction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A87\">Nevertheless, a contract procured through undue influence or that results from duress is not automatically void; instead, it is merely voidable. Therefore, it may also be ratified. The <em>Blum </em>Court explained, 59 Md.App. at 594-95, 477 A.2d 289:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-9\">A contract which may be avoided on the basis of duress may be ratified after the duress has been removed. The injured party must act to repudiate the agreement promptly or within a reasonable time after the removal of the duress, otherwise he may be deemed to have ratified the contract because of his silence and failure to act. <em>See Saggese v. Saggese, supra, </em>15 Md.App. at 388, 290 A.2d 794 and cases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>there cited. \u201cThe injured party may ratify the contract after the duress has been removed not only by his silence but also in various other ways, as, for example, by continuing to act in accordance with the contract, or by continuing to accept or claim benefits flowing from it.\u201d 17 C.J.S. <em>Contracts </em>\u00a7 169 (1963).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">Of significance here, the Court in <em>Blum </em>set forth the process that a court should follow to resolve the kind of challenge to a separation agreement that appellant presented. It explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-6\">What the chancellor should have done was to look at the \u25a0 consideration and determine if the terms were so unfair and inequitable as to require that the agreement be set aside. If they were not, and he held they were not, he should then have considered whether there was a confidential relationship; then he should have considered whether there was duress. If he found there was duress, he should next have considered (1) whether the conditions precedent to setting aside the agreement had been met, including whether the victim had retained the benefits; (2) whether the contract was thereafter ratified; and (3) whether laches applied. Then and only then should be have decided whether to set aside the agreement....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 602, 477 A.2d 289.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-8\">In addition to the claim of duress, appellant challenged Young\u2019s mental capacity at the time he executed the Separation Agreement and change of beneficiary form. Appellee asserts in its brief that \u201cappellant cannot impeach the separation agreement\u201d on the ground of the Decedent\u2019s capacity, because a contract entered into by a mentally deficient person is voidable only at the election of the mentally deficient person.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-9\">Contrary to the circuit court\u2019s conclusion, our review of the record does not reveal any \u201cbenefits\u201d gained by appellant with respect to the Agreement. As we indicated earlier, we may only uphold the circuit court\u2019s award of summary judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>for the reasons stated by the court, unless the matter is one for which we would have no discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\">Certainly, the Decedent was quite ill when he executed the Agreement and change of beneficiary form. Construing the facts in the light most favorable to appellant, as the court was required to do, the Decedent may well have lacked the mental capacity to contract at the time he signed those documents. Moreover, although the Agreement provides that the Decedent and appellant mutually renounced any claim to the other\u2019s retirement funds, the record does not reflect the value of appellant\u2019s funds. If the Decedent relinquished a claim to a fund of appellant\u2019s that had little value, this could certainly affect a view of whether appellant received any \u201cbenefits\u201d under the Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">More important, considering that Young was so ill when the Agreement was signed, it would have been reasonable for appellant to assume that Mr. Young would predecease her. With the reality of the Decedent\u2019s health in mind, it is hard to envision how it was in appellant\u2019s interest to execute the Agreement, so as to support the court\u2019s finding that she gained \u201cbenefits\u201d in doing so. Pursuant to the Agreement, the Decedent gave up his rights to appellant\u2019s retirement funds, just as she gave up her rights to his. But, the likelihood was that Young was never going to live long enough to collect appellant\u2019s retirement funds. Conversely, appellant\u2019s funds were not seriously at risk of recovery by Young whether or not she executed the Agreement, because Young probably was not going to live long enough to inherit them. Absent the Agreement, appellant, as the Decedent\u2019s surviving spouse, would have received the Decedent\u2019s pension benefits if he predeceased her. Therefore, it appears that appellant gave up valuable rights without gaining anything in return.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">The court below did not otherwise address the claim of duress or the issue of whether appellant could challenge the Agreement based on her husband\u2019s incapacity. Nor did it adhere to the roadmap articulated in <em>Blum. </em>In addition to the points set out above, we observe that these issues are intense<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>ly factual, and the parties had not yet conducted full discovery. Because we believe appellant was entitled to pursue these claims, the court acted prematurely in granting summary judgment as to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR ANNE ARUNDEL COUNTY VACATED.
