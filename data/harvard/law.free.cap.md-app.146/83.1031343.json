EYLER, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b116-12\">A jury in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County convicted Marvin Jenkins, the appellant, of second degree murder and use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence in the shooting death of Steven Dorsey, Jr. The appellant also was convicted of attempted first degree murder, attempted second degree murder, and first degree assault on Michael Clark, who was with Dorsey when he was shot.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-13\">The court sentenced the appellant to a term of thirty years imprisonment for second degree murder; a consecutive ten-year term for use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence; a consecutive twenty-year term for attempted first degree murder; and a concurrent twenty-year term for first degree assault. The court merged the attempted second degree murder conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>On appeal, the appellant presents five questions for review, which we have rephrased:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-5\">I. Did the trial court err in denying the appellant\u2019s motion for new trial filed, <em>inter alia, </em>on the ground of an improper contact between a State\u2019s witness and a juror during the trial?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-6\">II. Did the trial court err in admitting into evidence certain statements made in the presence of witness Alfred Smith?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-7\">III. Did the motion court err in denying the appellant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-8\">IV. Did the sentencing court err by not merging the conviction for assault with the conviction for attempted first degree murder?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-9\">V. Was the evidence sufficient to sustain the appellant\u2019s convictions?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b117-10\">For the following reasons, we shall affirm the judgments of the circuit court, except that we shall vacate the appellant\u2019s sentence for first degree assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-11\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b117-12\">Steven Dorsey, Jr., and Michael Clark spent most of the day and evening of April 13, 2000, together, smoking PCP and marijuana. By late that night, they were on Spring Street, near its intersection with Douglas Street, in the Lincoln Park area of Montgomery County. Clark saw two men walking toward them. He did not know or recognize either man. One of the men, later identified as David Barnett, addressed Dorsey, saying, \u201cJust the nigger I\u2019m looking for.\u201d Dorsey responded, \u201cI still got that for you.\u201d According to Clark, one man walked over to a car while the other man, a \u201cdark skinned guy[,] ... just started shooting.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b117-13\">Clark fled. Dorsey started running in the other direction. As Clark was running, he heard five or six shots, and realized that Dorsey was no longer running. Clark ran to a nearby home and banged on the door. When no one answered, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>returned to the scene of the shooting and found Dorsey lying on the ground. The police arrived a few minutes later.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">The appellant and Barnett were charged with numerous crimes arising out of the shooting incident. They were tried separately. At the appellant\u2019s trial, Clark testified for the State, and identified the appellant as the man who had walked over to the car, while the other man started shooting. Clark further testified that the appellant did not say anything during the encounter.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">Additional facts will be recited as pertinent to our discussion of the issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b118-9\">The appellant\u2019s trial started on March 19, 2001, and concluded on March 30, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-10\">Jury selection took place all of March 19 and part of March 20. After the State and the defense had chosen jurors and indicated satisfaction with the panel, but before the jurors were sworn, the court told the jurors, <em>inter alia:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-11\">[Y]ou must do everything reasonable within your power to avoid contact with any of the witnesses, parties, or persons you see in close contact with them outside of the courtroom.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-12\">Don\u2019t let anybody speak to you about this case, and don\u2019t speak to anyone about it yourself....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b118-13\">The jurors were sworn and the court then gave them detailed general instructions to follow during the trial. Those instructions included the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-14\">Do not have any contact outside the courtroom with any of the parties, witnesses, or lawyers....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-15\">If anything does occur, contrary to these instructions, please write a note as soon as possible. Do not discuss it with any other member of the jury, and give it to my law clerk, Ryan, and he will bring it to my attention.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>Again, upon any recess, as I mentioned, do not discuss the case with anyone or let anyone discuss the case with you or in your presence....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-5\">In addition, please avoid any contact with the parties, lawyers, and witnesses involved in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">On March 21, the State called Detective Patricia Pikulski as a witness. Pikulski, who is assigned to the homicide unit of the Montgomery County Police Department, was one of the officers who responded to the scene of the shooting. She testified that she arrived at the scene at about 12:20 a.m. About ten minutes later, she interviewed Clark, who was sitting in the back seat of a police cruiser. The interview lasted about 45 minutes. During the interview, Clark described the two men involved in the shooting. Pikulski testified about the descriptions Clark gave her of the two men.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">During her interview of Clark, Pikulski took notes. On cross-examination, her notes were marked as a defense exhibit, and she was questioned about them. On re-direct examination, Pikulski read her notes into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-8\">At the conclusion of Pikulski\u2019s testimony, the court reminded her that she was under subpoena. The court stated, \u201cThere is a rule on witnesses so don\u2019t discuss your testimony with any other witness or permit any other witness to discuss their testimony with you. We will notify you if we need you at a future time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b119-9\">On April 4, 2001, five days after the jury returned its verdict, Pikulski went to the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office on an unrelated matter. She saw Deborah Armstrong, Esq., the prosecutor in the appellant\u2019s case, and walked over to say hello. In the course of their conversation, Pikulski commented to Armstrong that while the trial had been in progress, she had had an inadvertent encounter with one of the jurors, Bruce McDonald, at a religious retreat held in Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-10\">Upon learning this information, Armstrong immediately contacted the court and defense counsel and requested an emergency hearing. The emergency hearing was held the next day, April 5, 2001. At the hearing, Armstrong disclosed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>what Pikulski had told her, and asked the court to summons McDonald to court so he could be questioned about his contact with Pikulski during the trial. After conferring with counsel, the court scheduled an evidentiary hearing for April 19, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">On April 9, 2001, the appellant filed a ten-day motion for new trial, under Md. Rule 4-331(a). He asserted as one basis for the motion that there had been an improper contact between Pikulski and McDonald during the trial that had prejudiced him and deprived him of his Sixth Amendment right to a fair trial. Specifically, the appellant argued that the contact had enhanced the credibility of the police in McDonald\u2019s eyes, when the defense was challenging police credibility with assertions that the police had conducted a sloppy investigation and had ignored key evidence favorable to the appellant. The appellant also argued that Pikulski and McDonald had deprived him of his right to know about the contact during the trial, by not bringing it to the court\u2019s attention during trial, in contravention of the court\u2019s instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">At the April 19, 2001 hearing, Pikulski testified as an adverse witness, called by the appellant. McDonald was called and examined by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">Pikulski stated that on Friday and Saturday, March 23 and 24, 2001, she attended a religious retreat in Virginia. The topic of the retreat was \u201cContemplation, Silence, Beauty and the Holy.\u201d She arrived at the retreat location at about 6:50 p.m. on March 23. About ten other people were present. Shortly after arriving, she started talking to a man named Bruce McDonald. She did not recognize him as someone she knew or ever had had contact with. After several minutes, McDonald walked away.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">About ten minutes later, McDonald returned to where Pi-kulski was standing and said either that he \u201cwas\u201d or \u201cis\u201d \u201con the jury.\u201d Thinking he had used the word \u201cwas,\u201d Pikulski responded, \u201cOh, you\u2019re one of the ones that convicted him?\u201d McDonald replied, \u201cI can\u2019t talk about it.\u201d Pikulski thought that was odd, and then asked whether McDonald was on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>jury in the trial that was \u201cright now?\u201d McDonald responded, \u201cYes.\u201d Pikulski then said, \u201cYou\u2019re right. We can\u2019t talk about this.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">The people attending the retreat went home Friday night and returned Saturday morning. The retreat was supposed to last until 7:00 p.m. on Saturday, but concluded early, at 1:30 p.m. McDonald and Pikulski had a brief discussion, and McDonald suggested they have lunch together. She agreed and the two walked to a restaurant a few doors down from where the retreat had been held.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">At lunch, Pikulski and McDonald talked about their families and discussed other personal topics. Pikulski learned that McDonald was a volunteer at the soup kitchen where she attends Sunday school. They did not talk about the appellant\u2019s case and Pikulski did not discuss her work or the police force in general. Pikulski and McDonald paid for their own meals. Pikulski then drove McDonald to his car. She was driving her own personal car, not a police car.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">On Monday, March 26, 2001, Pikulski told Detective Kenneth Penrod, her superior, about her encounter with McDonald at the retreat. She did not contact the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office because she did not think there was any problem with her talking to a juror in a case that was in trial, so long as they did not discuss the case itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">Pikulski acknowledged that even though she already had testified in the appellant\u2019s trial by the time of the retreat, she was under subpoena and could have been recalled to the stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-9\">McDonald testified that he attended the religious retreat in Virginia on March 23 and 24, 2001, with about 25 to 30 other people. On the evening of March 23, as the attendees were getting acquainted, he saw Pikulski and recognized her as a detective who had testified at the trial. At first, he walked away from her, because he wasn\u2019t sure what he should do. He then approached the detective and said, \u201cLook, you don\u2019t know who I am, but Pm a juror in a case that you testified in, and I can\u2019t have any dealings with you.\u201d Pikulski responded, \u201cOh, did you, you know, did you find him guilty?\u201d Taking Pikul-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>ski\u2019s remark to mean she thought he was a juror in a trial that had ended, <em>i.e., </em>not in the appellant\u2019s trial, McDonald replied that the trial still was in progress.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">McDonald and Pikulski did not discuss the matter any more. They did discuss general topics. The next day, they sat next to each other during the seminar, not by design, and then went to lunch together. They were alone for most of the meal, although at some point a friend of McDonald\u2019s entered the restaurant and joined them, for a short time. During lunch, Pikulski and McDonald discussed McDonald\u2019s work, which is in environmental matters, and Pikulski commented that her son was in the process of obtaining a degree in chemistry, a field he had become interested in by virtue of his interest in the environment.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">When their lunch was over, Pikulski offered to drop McDonald off at a car dealership where his car was being repaired. He accepted her offer. The dealership was about a half mile from the restaurant. After taking McDonald to his car, Pikulski went on her way, and the two had no more contact.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">The court did not ask McDonald any questions about why he did not bring his contact with Pikulski to the court\u2019s attention, during the trial; and the court was not asked by either counsel to make any such inquiry of McDonald.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">The State filed an opposition to the appellant\u2019s motion for new trial. The court held a hearing on the motion on June 20, 2001. On July 16, 2001, the court issued a written opinion denying the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">The court found that the contact between Pikulski and McDonald had occurred inadvertently, not intentionally, at least initially, but that it nevertheless was contrary to its instructions and therefore was improper. Applying the test articulated in <em>Allen v. State, </em>89 Md.App. 25, 597 A.2d 489 (1991), the court then analyzed whether the improper contact had prejudiced the appellant\u2019s defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>The court concluded that, even if it presumed prejudice from the improper contact, the State had rebutted the presumption, and \u201c[the appellant\u2019s] right to a fair trial and right to a fair and impartial juror, was not in any way impaired ... by the contact that occurred.\u201d The bases for the court\u2019s ruling on the issue of prejudice were as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">The court found accurate and credible McDonald\u2019s testimony about the substance and nature of his contact with Pikulski. It concluded that the only communication between the two that possibly was about the trial was Pikulski\u2019s question (\u201cdid you find him guilty?\u201d) that McDonald took as a reference to another trial, not to the appellant\u2019s trial. The court found that Pikulski\u2019s involvement as a witness in the appellant\u2019s case had been minimal, and therefore it was <em>\u201cextremely </em>unlikely that Mr. McDonald could or would have assumed that the \u2018other trial\u2019 [the detective was referring to] was that of [the appellant\u2019s] co-defendant, Mr. Barnett.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) The court further found that even if McDonald had assumed that the \u201cother trial\u201d was Barnett\u2019s trial, Pikulski\u2019s question would not have harmed the appellant in his defense, because the appellant\u2019s defense was predicated on Barnett\u2019s having been the shooter. Indeed, part of the defense theory was that the appellant was a victim of mistaken identity and that Barnett had committed the murder with his (Barnett\u2019s) brother, not with the appellant. Barnett\u2019s having been found guilty was consistent with that theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">The court also found that while the contact between Pikulski and McDonald had made Pikulski more credible in McDonald\u2019s eyes, the enhanced credibility \u201cwould have worked in the [appellant\u2019s] favor.\u201d Not only did the defense not challenge Pikulski\u2019s credibility at trial, it adopted her testimony in several respects and attempted to use it to discredit Michael Clark, the State\u2019s primary witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">Finally, the court found that the improper contact had not caused McDonald to have a more positive view of other police detectives called by the State and attacked by the defense for conducting a sloppy investigation. The court concluded that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>even if McDonald\u2019s assessment of Pikulski\u2019s credibility had been enhanced by their contact it did not logically follow that McDonald would have transferred his positive credibility assessment of Pikulski to the other police detective witnesses.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">On appeal, the appellant contends that the trial court committed legal error in denying his motion for new trial. He maintains that the improper contact between Pikulski and McDonald deprived him of his due process right to have his guilt or innocence \u201cdetermined by an impartial fact finder who depends solely on the evidence and argument introduced in open court.\u201d <em>Allen v. State, supra, </em>89 Md.App. at 42, 597 A.2d 489. He argues that prejudice was \u201cinherent\u201d in the improper contact and even though Pikulski and McDonald each testified to not having discussed the case, the substantial nature of their contact at the religious retreat gave rise to a \u201cprobability of prejudice\u201d to McDonald\u2019s ability to fairly evaluate the case. The appellant asserts the improper contact heightened Pikul-ski\u2019s credibility in McDonald\u2019s eyes, caused him to have an \u201callegiance\u201d to her, and had the \u201cspillover effect\u201d of also enhancing McDonald\u2019s credibility assessment of the entire police department. He maintains that under the circumstances, and given that one of his defense theories was that the police had been sloppy in their investigation, the trial court should have found that the State did not rebut the presumption of prejudice, as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">The appellant further argues that Pikulski\u2019s inquiry to McDonald (\u201cOh you\u2019re one of the ones that convicted him?\u201d) could have led McDonald \u201cto believe that Pikulski believed that the trial had finished and that she had expected [the appellant] to be convicted.\u201d He asserts that this remark could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>have improperly influenced McDonald to conclude that the appellant in fact was guilty of the crimes charged, thereby making McDonald a partial juror; and that for this reason, the trial court was required to grant a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">Finally, the appellant maintains that the improper contact \u201ccast[ ] the shadow of the appearance of impropriety onto the entire judicial system.\u201d He points to two articles in local newspapers published soon after he filed his motion for new trial documenting the encounter between McDonald and Pi-kulski, and argues that the articles evidence the public\u2019s displeasure at such an improper contact having occurred. He maintains that the potential for damage to the community\u2019s confidence in \u201cthe system\u201d was such as to have required the granting of a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">The State counters that even presuming prejudice from the improper contact between Pikulski and McDonald, the presumption was rebuttable and the trial court properly found that the State overcame the presumption by showing that the contact was \u201cextremely limited and completely innocuous.\u201d It also maintains that even if Pikulski\u2019s credibility was enhanced in McDonald\u2019s eyes as a result of the improper contact, the trial court reasonably concluded that no prejudice had resulted to the appellant because, in advancing his defense theory, the appellant relied on Pikulski\u2019s testimony. In addition, the State asserts that the trial court properly found it was unlikely that the enhancement of Pikulski\u2019s credibility in McDonald\u2019s eyes created a \u201cspillover effect\u201d of enhancing his credibility assessment of the entire police department. As for the appellant\u2019s public perception argument, the State responds that the issue was not raised or decided below and lacks merit in any event.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">In their briefs, the parties maintain that under <em>Merritt v. State, </em>367 Md. 17, 785 A.2d 756 (2001), the proper standard of review of this issue is \u201charmless error.\u201d In <em>Merritt, </em>the Court of Appeals explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-8\">[Wjhen an alleged error is committed during the trial, when the losing party or that party\u2019s counsel, without fault, does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>not discover the alleged error during the trial, and when the issue is then raised by a motion for a new trial, [the denial of that motion is reviewed] under a standard of whether the denial was erroneous.... [W]here [the court] concluded] that error did occur, the matter of prejudice [is]' received under the harmless standard of <em>Dorsey v. State, </em>276 Md. 638, 350 A.2d 665 (1976).\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AYl\"><em>Id. </em>at 30-31, 785 A.2d 756.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">In <em>Merritt, </em>the defendant was convicted by a jury of several offenses arising from a murder. Two days after the verdict, the parties discovered the court clerk had mistakenly marked several documents not admitted into evidence and sent them to the jury room during deliberations. On the basis of that error, the defendant filed a motion for new trial. The court denied the motion. The Court of Appeals reversed on appeal, holding that the presence of the unadmitted exhibits in the jury room likely caused prejudice to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">In advancing its argument on appeal, the State maintained that the trial court\u2019s decision to deny the motion for new trial was subject to reversal only for an abuse of discretion. The Court \u201cflatly rejected]\u201d that' argument. In doing so, it discussed at length the evolution of the standard of review for a decision denying a motion for new trial. The Court noted that while such a decision ordinarily is reviewed for abuse of discretion, \u201cthere are situations in which there is virtually no discretion to deny a new trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 29, 785 A.2d 756. Referring to its decision in <em>Buck v. Cam\u2019s Broadloom Rugs, Inc., </em>328 Md. 51, 612 A.2d 1294 (1992), the Court explained that a trial judge has little or no discretion to deny a motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>for new trial when, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201ccompetent extrinsic evidence discloses that a jury\u2019s consideration of the case was seriously distorted by evidence that should not have been before the jury....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 30, 785 A.2d 756 (citing <em>Buck v. Cam\u2019s Broadloom Rugs, supra, </em>328 Md. at 58-59, 612 A.2d 1294 (referring to <em>Wernsing v. General Motors Carp., </em>298 Md. 406, 420, 470 A.2d 802 (1984))).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">The Court went on to reason that when the losing party, through no fault of his own, does not discover an error until after trial, the proper standard for reviewing the denial of a motion for new trial based on that error is harmless error, not abuse of discretion. <em>Merritt v. State, supra, </em>367 Md. at 30-31, 785 A.2d 756. The Court explained that the \u201csubstance and result of the clerk\u2019s action was essentially the same as the action of a trial judge in erroneously admitting an exhibit into evidence. The only real difference would be that, in the latter situation, defense counsel would have been aware of the action and would have had an opportunity to object.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 32, 785 A.2d 756. It further reasoned that because the effect of the court clerk\u2019s action was the same as if the trial court had committed legal error in improperly admitting evidence during trial, a review of the denial of the motion for new trial properly would be conducted for legal error, not for an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">The holding in <em>Memtt </em>does not mean that the standard of review of the trial court\u2019s decision to deny the appellant\u2019s motion for new trial in this case is \u201charmless error\u201d instead of \u201cabuse of discretion.\u201d To be sure, in both cases, the problem at issue was not discovered until after the verdict had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>rendered, through no fault of either party. The similarities end there, however. In <em>Merritt, </em>as the Court explained, the error by the court clerk was the equivalent of the trial court\u2019s having committed legal error \u2014 not abusing its exercise of discretion \u2014 by admitting plainly inadmissible evidence. If the error had been known to the parties when it happened, and had generated an objection, a decision by the trial court to allow the material to go to the jury nevertheless would have been reviewed on appeal for error, not for abuse of discretion. The fact that that decision ultimately was made by the trial court in the context of a motion for new trial, because the problem was not discovered when it happened, did not convert the standard for reviewing the decision to \u201cabuse of discretion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">In the case at bar, if the contact between Pikulski and McDonald had become known to the parties soon after it happened, while the trial was still in progress, the appellant could have moved the court to remove McDonald from the jury and replace him with an alternate juror,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> or could have moved for a mistrial. Either decision \u2014 whether to remove McDonald or whether to grant a mistrial \u2014 would have been a discretionary call by the trial court based upon its assessment of whether the improper contact had had a prejudicial impact on the appellant\u2019s right to a fair trial. \u201cThe trial judge\u2019s discretion extends to matters concerning juror misconduct or other such irregularity in the conduct of others which may affect the jury.\u201d <em>Eades v.

A ruling on a motion for new trial under Rule 4-331(a) also is a matter of discretion subject to review for abuse. Accordingly, we shall review the trial court\u2019s ruling denying the motion for new trial filed by the appellant on the basis of the improper contact under the abuse of discretion standard, not under the \u201charmless error\u201d standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">We now turn to the merits of the appellant\u2019s first issue. In a state court criminal proceeding, the Fourteenth Amendment guarantees the accused due process, including the right to be tried by a fair and impartial trier of fact. <em>Nebraska Press Ass\u2019n v. Stuart, </em>427 U.S. 539, 551, 96 S.Ct. 2791, 49 L.Ed.2d 683 (1976); <em>Turner v. Louisiana, </em>379 U.S. 466, 471-72, 85 S.Ct. 546, 13 L.Ed.2d 424 (1965); <em>Eades v. State, supra, </em>75 Md.App. at 420, 541 A.2d 1001. To be fair and impartial, the trier of fact must base its decision in the case on the evidence admitted at trial. <em>Irvin v. Dowd, </em>366 U.S. 717, 722, 81 S.Ct. 1639, 6 L.Ed.2d 751 (1961); <em>Ware v. State, </em>360 Md. 650, 669, 759 A.2d 764 (2000); <em>Calhoun v. State, </em>297 Md. 563, 580, 468 A.2d 45 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">In a jury trial, when a private communication takes place between a third party and a juror, it raises a concern that the juror may reach a verdict not on the basis of the evidence, but on the basis of the communication. <em>Eades v. State, supra, </em>75 Md.App. at 420, 541 A.2d 1001. <em>See also United States v. Day, </em>830 F.2d 1099, 1103 (10th Cir.1987); <em>Owen v. Duckworth, </em>727 F.2d 643, 646 (7th Cir.1984). Thus, \u201cprivate communications between jurors and third persons are absolutely \u2018forbidden\u2019 and require the court to order a new trial \u2018unless their harmlessness is made to appear.\u2019 \u201d <em>Eades v. State, </em>75 Md.App. at 420-21, 541 A.2d 1001 (citing <em>Mattox v.

State, supra, </em>89 Md.App. at 46, 597 A.2d 489 (citing <em>Harford Sands, Inc. v. Groft, </em>320 Md. 136, 138-39, 577 A.2d 7 (1990) (quoting <em>Wernsing v.

Brock, </em>118 Md.App. 475, 525, 703 A.2d 208 (1997). \u201cWhere the record affirmatively shows prejudice by improper communications, the error requires reversal; but where the record affirmatively shows no prejudice, reversal is not required.\u201d <em>Allen v. State, supra, </em>89 Md.App. at 46, 597 A.2d 489; <em>Aron v. Brock, supra, </em>118 Md.App. at 525, 703 A.2d 208. <em>See Eades v. State, supra, </em>75 Md.App. at 422-23, 541 A.2d 1001. On the other hand, when the record is silent with respect to whether the juror contact was prejudicial, \u201cprejudice is presumed, and the burden falls on the state to rebut the presumption of harm.\u201d <em>Allen v. State, supra, </em>89 Md.App. at 47, 597 A.2d 489 (footnote omitted). <em>See Remmer v. United States, </em>347 U.S. 227, 229, 74 S.Ct. 450, 98 L.Ed. 654 (1954) (\u201cIn a criminal case, any private communication, contact, or tampering, directly or indirectly, with a juror during a trial about a matter pending. before a jury is, for obvious reasons, deemed presumptively prejudicial.... The presumption is not conclusive, but the burden rests heavily upon the Government to establish, after notice to and hearing of the defendant, that such contact with the juror was harmless to the defendant.\u201d). \u201cThe decision as to whether the State has met this burden is committed to the trial court\u2019s discretion, and ... will be reversed only upon a finding of abuse of that discretion.\u201d <em>Allen v. State, supra, </em>89 Md.App. at 47, 597 A.2d 489.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">The State argues that recent decisions of the Supreme Court and other federal courts establish that prejudice is no longer presumed in every instance of improper jury contact. Indeed, as this Court noted in <em>Eades v. State, </em>the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Smith v. Phillips, </em>455 U.S. 209, 102 S.Ct. 940, 71 L.Ed.2d 78 (1982), \u201chas cast some doubt on <em>Remmer\u2019s </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>presumption of prejudice arising from any private communication with a juror about a matter pending before the jury.\u201d 75 Md.App. at 421, 541 A.2d 1001. In <em>Smith, </em>the Supreme Court refused to presume prejudice in a state court murder trial when during the trial a sitting juror applied for a job as an investigator in the prosecutor\u2019s office. The Court noted that \u201cdue process does not require a new trial every time a juror has been placed in a potentially compromising situation.\u201d <em>Smith v. Phillips, supra, </em>455 U.S. at 217, 102 S.Ct. 940. Rather, \u201c[d]ue process means ... a trial judge ever watchful to prevent prejudicial occurrences and to determine the effect of such occurrences when they happen.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court held that a post-trial hearing conducted by the trial court, like the one ordered in <em>Remmer, </em>was \u201csufficient to decide allegations of juror partiality....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 218, 102 S.Ct. 940.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">Despite the holding in <em>Smith, </em>this Court in <em>Eades </em>\u201cas-sumefd]\u201d that the presumption of prejudice from contact with a juror during trial, under <em>Remmer, </em>remained the law. 75 Md.App. at 423, 541 A.2d 1001. Several years later, in <em>Allen, </em>we again favorably cited <em>Remmer </em>for the proposition that prejudice to the defendant is to be presumed when there has been an extrajudicial juror contact. <em>Allen v. State, supra, </em>89 Md.App. at 47, 597 A.2d 489. In the case at bar, the State points out that since <em>Eades </em>and <em>Allen </em>were decided, the presumption has been further eroded by more recent federal decisions. <em>See United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 739, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993) (\u201ca presumption of prejudice as opposed to a specific analysis does not change the ultimate inquiry: Did the intrusion [by a third party on the jury] affect the jury\u2019s deliberations and thereby its verdict?\u201d); <em>United States v. Sylvester, </em>143 F.3d 923, 934 (5th Cir.1998) (\u201cthe <em>Remmer </em>presumption of prejudice cannot survive <em>Phillips </em>and <em>Olano </em>.... [0]nly when the court determines that prejudice is <em>likely </em>should the government be required to prove its absence. This rule comports with our long-standing recognition of the trial court\u2019s considerable discretion in investigating and resolving charges of jury tampering\u201d) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>While these recent decisions make questionable the continuing vitality of the <em>Remmer </em>presumption of prejudice, we need not decide in the instant case whether presumed prejudice remains the proper standard in Maryland. Here, the trial court exercised its discretion to deny the new trial motion on a finding that the State had rebutted any presumed prejudice to the appellant from the improper contact.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">The parties do not dispute that the contact between Pikulski and McDonald was improper. The contact was contrary to the trial court\u2019s instructions to the jurors forbidding them from interacting with third parties during the trial. McDonald\u2019s initial contact with Pikulski was inadvertent, but his subsequent contact with her, including having lunch and discussing their personal lives, was not. While the trial court credited McDonald\u2019s testimony that he and Pikulski did not discuss the case, the fact that they continued their contact beyond the brief communication in which they realized their predicament suggests the potential for prejudice. Indeed, the appellant cites several cases in which courts found contacts between jurors and witnesses prejudicial even in the absence of evidence that the contacts included discussions of the case. <em>See Turner v. Louisiana, supra, </em>379 U.S. at 473, 85 S.Ct. 546 (\u201ceven if it could be assumed that the deputies never did discuss the case directly with any members of the jury, it would be blinking reality not to recognize the extreme prejudice inherent in this continual association throughout the trial between the jurors and these two key witnesses for the prosecution.\u201d); <em>United States v. Marine, </em>84 F.Supp. 785, 787 (D.Del.1949) (new trial warranted when juror and prosecution witness ate lunch together during the trial, even when it was uncertain that the two had discussed the case); <em>Miles v. State, </em>261 Ala. 670, 675, 75 So.2d 479, 484 (Ala.1954) (defendant was entitled to a new trial \u201cfree from probability of injury\u201d after three police officers who were witnesses for the prosecution accompanied the jury to and from lunch during the trial, even though there had been no discussion of the case); <em>Kelley v. State, </em>555 N.E.2d 140, 142 (Ind.1990) (error in failing to grant motion for mistrial after it was discovered that a witness for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>the prosecution had sat with three of the six jurors during a lunch recess); <em>Romo v. State, </em>500 P.2d 678, 680 (Wyo.1972) (holding that the trial court should have granted the defendant\u2019s motion for mistrial after it was revealed that a police officer who also was a prosecution witness had sat with several jurors during a lunch break, even though the witness testified that he did not discuss the \u201cbusiness\u201d of the case with the jurors).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">As these cases recognize, however, when an improper contact has occurred, and when prejudice from the contact is presumed, the presumption is rebuttable. Indeed, in <em>Fades </em>and <em>Allen, </em>this Court concluded that \u201cthe inquiry of the trial court and the juror\u2019s response thereto effectively overcame the presumption operating in Lthe] appellant\u2019s favor.\u201d <em>Eades v. State, supra, </em>75 Md.App. at 423-24, 541 A.2d 1001. <em>See Allen v. State, supra, </em>89 Md.App. at 48, 597 A.2d 489.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">In the case at bar, the trial court heard testimony from Pikulski and McDonald about their contact during the trial and on the basis of that evidence made factual findings and ultimately concluded that the State had shown by a preponderance of the evidence that the improper contact had not prejudiced the appellant\u2019s right to a fair trial by an impartial jury. In other words, the trial court found that assuming a presumption of prejudice from the improper contact, the State met its burden of rebutting the presumption by showing that the contact did not harm the appellant\u2019s due process rights. Our review of the record reveals that the trial court\u2019s factual findings concerning the issue of prejudice were supported by competent evidence and were not clearly erroneous; that its second-level factual finding that the appellant\u2019s due process rights were not harmed by the contact likewise was supported by the evidence and was based in reason; and that its decision to exercise discretion to deny the appellant\u2019s motion for new trial was sound and not abusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">As we have noted, the trial court agreed with the appellant that the improper contact resulted in McDonald\u2019s having an \u201cenhanced view of [Pikulski\u2019s] credibility.\u201d The trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>concluded, however, that given the appellant\u2019s theories of defense, McDonald\u2019s positive view of Pikulski\u2019s credibility was not harmful to him; on the contrary, it was helpful. The trial judge observed: \u201cNot only did the defense not contradict Detective Pikulski\u2019s testimony, to the contrary, they embraced it in an effort to discredit the testimony of one of the State\u2019s key witnesses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">The record supports this finding. As we noted above, the appellant\u2019s primary defense theory was misidentification. The State\u2019s star witness, Michael Clark, was an eyewitness to Dorsey\u2019s murder and identified the appellant as being present with Barnett at the scene. -The defense sought to use Pikul-ski\u2019s testimony to discredit Clark by showing that the version of events he told her on the night of the shooting was at odds with several later versions he gave and with his trial testimony. In closing argument, in her effort to persuade the jury to reject Clark\u2019s t\u00e9stimony, defense counsel urged the jury to accept Pikulski\u2019s testimony as accurate and credible:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AGA\">Remember poor Detective Pikulski, who tried very very hard to get as much out of Michael Clark as she could and Michael Clark sat on this stand and he told you that he told Detective Pikulski that just after giving a forty-five minute interview with her, and a five page statement, that everything he had told her was wrong. That defies logic and common sense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-6\"><em>Detective Pikulski, I would suggest, is an experienced honest person and testified truthfully and that [she had] no motive, no motive whatsoever to be other than truthful to you. </em>Had Michael Clark told her that, she would have told you that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b134-8\">In <em>Allen v. State, supra, </em>we explained that \u201ca trial court may reasonably find that extrinsic evidence that actually assists a defendant\u2019s case is not prejudicial to him and, therefore, not sufficient evidence upon which to direct a mistrial.\u201d 89 Md.App. at 49, 597 A.2d 489. <em>See, e.g., Carpenter v. United States, </em>475 A.2d 369, 376 (D.C.App.1984); <em>State v. Olin, </em>103 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>Idaho 391, 399, 648 P.2d 203, 211 (1982); <em>State v. Bonaparte, </em>222 Neb. 469, 472, 384 N.W.2d 304, 306 (1986). In <em>Allen, </em>brothers Peter and David Allen, along with another co-defendant, were tried on drug kingpin distribution and conspiracy charges. During jury deliberations, David Allen had breakfast with a dismissed alternate juror who then related to one of the sitting jurors that David had admitted selling drugs but had denied selling them for his brother and co-defendant, Peter. The judge conducted a <em>voir dire </em>of the juror who received the <em>ex parte </em>information. The defendants moved for a mistrial on the basis of the improper juror conduct. The trial court denied the motion and without informing the rest of the jury about the <em>ex parte </em>communications, instructed the jury to continue its deliberations. The jury returned with a verdict that day, finding Peter and David guilty on all counts, and their co-defendant not guilty on all counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">On appeal, both brothers argued that the trial court had erred in denying their motion for a mistrial. We affirmed, holding, <em>inter alia, </em>that the contact could not have prejudiced Peter because the statement made to the sitting juror \u201cexculpated rather than inculpated [him].\u201d <em>Allen v. State, supra, </em>89 Md.App. at 49, 597 A.2d 489.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">By the same token, in this case, McDonald\u2019s enhanced view of Pikulski\u2019s credibility likely would have <em>positively </em>influenced his view of the defense\u2019s theory of the case. Pikulski\u2019s testimony was that Clark give her a statement explaining, <em>inter alia, </em>that he and Dorsey had spent the afternoon of April 13, 2000, together, that before the shooting they were on the street but not walking together, and that when the two approached Dorsey, words were spoken, but Clark could not hear them. There was no indication from Pikulski that Clark told her or led her to think his statement was not an accurate version of the events. By contrast, Clark testified that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>gave Pikulski a version of events that was inaccurate, because he was scared and was high on drugs, and that after reciting the events, he told Pikulski his statement was inaccurate.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">The defense urged the jurors to believe Pikulski because believing her would lead them to conclude that Clark simply-made up different versions of the events of the night of the shooting, depending upon what was expedient and helpful to him, and that therefore nothing he said, including his in-court testimony, could be believed. Thus, it was reasonable for the trial court to conclude that, to the extent the jurors found Pikulski credible, it was more likely they would find the State\u2019s star witness <em>not </em>credible, and hence more likely that they would find the appellant not guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">As we have explained, the trial court also rejected the appellant\u2019s argument that McDonald\u2019s positive credibility assessment of Pikulski based on their improper contact had prejudiced him by in turn enhancing his view of the entire police department. The court reasoned that the mere fact that McDonald may have been more inclined to believe Pikul-ski after spending time with her at the religious retreat did not reasonably support a finding that he would favor the police force\u2019s version of how their investigation was conducted over the appellant\u2019s. As the court pointed out, there was nothing about the nature of the contact between Pikulski and McDonald that would have led McDonald to view Pikulski as a representative of the entire police force or to generalize his view of her character to the police force as a whole. This reasoning is sound and supported by logic.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">In addition, the appellant\u2019s argument is belied by the strategy he followed at trial. As noted above, the <em>defense </em>urged the jurors to believe Pikulski\u2019s testimony, apparently without any concern that their doing so would have the \u201cspillover\u201d effect of making the police force\u2019s version of the investigation more believable than the appellant\u2019s version. The defense would not have adopted a strategy to tout Pikulski\u2019s credibility to the jury if the strategy was likely to harm its \u201csloppy police investigation\u201d defense theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>The trial court found no merit in the appellant\u2019s argument that Pikulski\u2019s remark to McDonald that \u201cyou\u2019re one of the ones that convicted him\u201d could have influenced him to think he (the appellant) was guilty of the crimes charged. McDonald\u2019s testimony, credited by the court, was that when he approached Pikulski at the retreat and mentioned being a juror she did not seem to know, and he did not believe she knew, what case he was serving in. That being the case, there would be no reason for McDonald to have thought Pikulski\u2019s comment meant she thought, as the appellant puts it, that the appellant\u2019s \u201ctrial had finished and that she had expected [him] to be convicted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">In this Court, the appellant asserts that the contact between Pikulski and McDonald was such that they formed a \u201cspiritual/religious bond\u201d that caused McDonald to feel, consciously or subconsciously, a \u201csense of loyalty\u201d to Pikulski\u2019s \u201cside\u201d of the case and that could have made him \u201cfe[el] uncomfortable voting any way but \u2018guilty.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">We note that the appellant did not present this argument in his motion for new trial or during the June 20, 2001 hearing on the motion. To the extent it was implicit in his more general argument about enhanced credibility, it also was implicitly rejected by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">Again, the defense theory of the case was based in part on Pikulski\u2019s testimony; therefore, although Pikulski was called to testify by the State, she was not a witness tied strongly to one \u201cside\u201d of the case. Moreover, the trial court found from competent and material evidence that Pikulski did not communicate to McDonald a belief that the appellant was guilty or an endorsement of the State\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-8\">Finally, we agree with the State that the appellant did not preserve the argument that the trial court should have granted him a new trial to protect a positive public image for the criminal justice system. In his \u201cSupplemental Memorandum and Request to Strike Testimony,\u201d filed in the trial court on May 10, 2001, the appellant cited two newspaper articles about the case. Then, at the June 20, 2001 hearing on the motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>for new trial, the appellant suggested in argument to the court that McDonald may have read the articles and, realizing that \u201cthere was essentially an uproar over that type of contact during the course of trial between an agent of the State and a juror,\u201d may have \u201cattempt[ed] to minimize or disregard the comments by the detective.\u201d At no point below did the appellant argue that public controversy or the public\u2019s reaction over the contact between Pikulski and McDonald warranted granting a new trial. \u201cOrdinarily, the appellate court will not decide any other issue unless it plainly appears by the record to have been raised in or decided by the trial court.\u201d Md. Rule 8-131(a); <em>see Walker v. State, </em>338 Md. 253, 262, 658 A.2d 239 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">Even if this issue had been raised below, the appellant would fare no better. To be sure, in a general sense, how the public perceives the criminal justice system affects whether defendants receive fair and impartial trials. <em>See Young v. United States, </em>481 U.S. 787, 811-12, 107 S.Ct. 2124, 95 L.Ed.2d 740 (1987) (conduct of prosecutor); <em>Jackson v. State, </em>364 Md. 192, 207, 772 A.2d 273 (2001) (sentencing). We are dealing in this appeal with a particular defendant and a particular trial, however, and the specific question whether an instance of improper contact between a witness for the State and a juror, during the trial, was prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">Again, even assuming prejudice from the improper contact, it was well within the discretion of the trial court to determine whether that prejudice was outweighed by countervailing evidence of lack of prejudice. After hearing testimony from Pikulski and McDonald and considering the arguments presented by the parties, the trial court concluded that it was satisfied that the improper contact did not prejudice the appellant in his defense. We agree with the State that the factual findings on which this decision was based were not clearly erroneous and were supported by competent and material evidence. Accordingly, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the appellant\u2019s motion for new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">Alfred Smith was called to testify by the State.

It is not clear \u2014 it is not a hearsay statement. We are not offering it for the truth of the matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-10\">For all we know, it was very much in furtherance of the conspiracy in the sense that the gun deal was just a ruse to establish a contact with Mr. Dorsey.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-11\">Mr. Dorsey had no clue that his life was in jeopardy at the time that he encountered these two individuals. Consistent with that, Your Honor, the [S]tate\u2019s position is that the whole gun deal could have been simply a ruse to establish a contact between them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-12\">It is our understanding that prior to that there had been no contact.

Rather, he argues that Smith\u2019s testimony about Barnett\u2019s inquiry was irrelevant, and that any relevance it did have was outweighed by its prejudicial effect; therefore, it should have been excluded. Specifically, he maintains that because there was no evidence that he was present during the exchange between Dorsey and Barnett three days before the shooting, or that he had any knowledge of it, the exchange was irrelevant because it did not tend to show that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>he (the appellant) was present with Barnett at the time of the shooting. He further argues that to the extent the exchange established a motive for Barnett to kill Dorsey, it was prejudicial because its effect \u201cwas ... to carry over to [the appellant] as an implicit guilt by association.\u201d Finally, the appellant argues that the court\u2019s instruction was insufficient to cure the \u201cmanifest\u201d prejudice the evidence caused.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">The State counters that the appellant waived this issue for appeal because he did not argue with specificity the grounds for his objection at trial; and, even assuming the issue was preserved for review, the trial court properly admitted as relevant non-hearsay Smith\u2019s testimony about the words he heard Barnett say to Dorsey three days before the shooting. The State maintains that Smith\u2019s testimony was offered not to show the truth of Barnett\u2019s words (that he wanted to buy a gun from Dorsey), but to show that Barnett and Dorsey had had some contact prior to the shooting and to explain what Dorsey might have meant when, right before the shooting, he said to Barnett, \u201cI still got that for you.\u201d The State argues that the evidence was relevant to its theory that the appellant had aided and abetted Barnett in the commission of the crimes against Dorsey, and that, rather than \u201cconstituting an unfair spillover effect to [the appellant], the evidence was equally probative as to him,\u201d and was not unduly prejudicial.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Therefore, the trial court properly exercised its discretion to admit the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">We reject the State\u2019s lack of preservation argument. \u201cIt is well-settled that when specific grounds are given at trial for an objection, the party objecting will be held to those grounds and ordinarily waives any grounds not specified that are later raised on appeal.\u201d <em>Klauenberg v. State, </em>355 Md. 528, 541, 735 A.2d 1061 (1999). Admittedly, the appellant\u2019s argument in response to the State\u2019s proffer focused on his right of confron<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>tation.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The argument he makes on appeal, that the evidence was irrelevant, was part of his confrontation argument, however. The appellant told the trial court he was objecting to the use of the evidence to implicate him because \u201cwe have reason to believe, either, one, that this attempted purchase never occurred or, two, if there was an attempt it was under circumstances that Barnett was not motivated to then murder Dorsey.\u201d At the heart of the appellant\u2019s argument about needing to confront Barnett was the notion that if he could question Barnett, he could show that he (the appellant) was not involved in the murder and that any evidence about Barnett\u2019s motivations was irrelevant to the issue of the appellant\u2019s participation in the crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">We reject the appellant\u2019s argument on its merits, however. Relevant evidence is \u201cevidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action <em>more probable or less probable </em>than it would be without the evidence.\u201d Md. Rule 5-401 (emphasis added). <em>See Dorsey v. State, </em>276 Md. 638, 643, 350 A.2d 665 (1976) (\u201cThe real test of admissibility of evidence in a criminal case is \u2018the connection of the fact proved with the offense charged, as evidence which has a natural tendency to establish the fact at issue.\u2019 \u201d) (citing <em>MacEwen v. State, </em>194 Md. 492, 501, 71 A.2d 464 (1950)). Rulings on the admissibility of evidence, including relevancy determinations, are within the sound discretion of the trial court and will not be disturbed on appeal absent a clear abuse of discretion. <em>White v. State, </em>324 Md. 626, 637, 598 A.2d 187 (1991). Ordinarily, relevant evidence is admissible. Md. Rule 5-402. It is within the discretion of the trial court to decide whether relevant evidence should not be admitted because \u201cits probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice .... \u201d Md. Rule 5-403. <em>See also Sowell v. State, </em>122 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>Md.App. 222, 228, 712 A.2d 96 (1998), <em>aff'd on other grounds, </em>353 Md. 713, 728 A.2d 712 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">The trial court properly determined that Barnett\u2019s inquiry to Dorsey, spoken in Smith\u2019s presence three days before the shooting, was not hearsay, because it was not offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted, that is, that Barnett in fact wanted to purchase a gun from Dorsey. Rather, the words were offered to show a connection between Barnett and Dorsey \u2014 -that they had had a conversation three days before the shooting and that from what Barnett said, Dorsey would have thought Barnett wanted to buy a gun from him. The words tended to prove the existence of a connection between Barnett and Dorsey, and to explain why, in response to Barnett\u2019s comment just before the shooting, \u201cJust the nigger I\u2019m looking for,\u201d Dorsey said, \u201cI still got that for you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">The evidence was relevant to show it was more probable than not that Barnett and Dorsey had had contact before the shooting and Dorsey would have thought Barnett was looking for him. A pre-existing connection between Barnett and Dorsey was of consequence in the case against the appellant regardless of whether there also was evidence that the appellant knew about it. There was evidence connecting the appellant to Barnett and, as we shall explain, tending to show that the appellant was present and aiding and abetting Barnett in the commission of the shooting. Accordingly, evidence tending to explain Barnett\u2019s presence at the scene and his prior relationship to Dorsey also was relevant to whether the appellant simply was present at the scene or was participating as an aider or abettor.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">Moreover, as stated above, it was within the trial court\u2019s discretion to determine whether the probative value of the evidence would be substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the appellant. In ruling the evidence admissible, the trial court noted that the appellant would be permitted to examine Smith about whether the statement in fact was made; and at the defense\u2019s request, the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>gave a curative instruction limiting the use of the evidence.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The trial court did not abuse its discretion in ruling, implicitly, that the probative value of the evidence of Barnett\u2019s statement was not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudicial effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">The appellant next contends that the motion court erred in denying his motion to suppress Clark\u2019s extrajudicial and in-court identifications of him. According to the appellant, the procedure used by the police in procuring the extrajudicial identification was impermissibly suggestive, in part because he was the only person who appeared in both a photographic array and lineup presented to Clark. Moreover, he argues that the State failed to overcome the presumption in favor of excluding overly suggestive identification evidence by demonstrating that the identification was reliable. The appellant maintains that the in-court identification was tainted by the extrajudicial identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">The State responds that the extrajudicial identification procedure used by the police was not impermissibly suggestive and, even if it was, Clark\u2019s identification was sufficiently rehable to warrant the denial of the appellant\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">\u201cDue process protects the accused against the introduction of evidence of, or tainted by, unreliable pretrial identifications obtained through unnecessarily suggestive procedures.\u201d <em>McDuffie v. State, </em>115 Md.App. 359, 366, 693 A.2d 360 (1997) (citing <em>Moore v. Illinois, </em>434 U.S. 220, 227, 98 S.Ct. 458, 54 L.Ed.2d 424 (1977)). Maryland case law establishes a two-prong test for resolving challenges to extrajudicial identifications. <em>McDuffie v. State, supra, </em>115 Md.App. at 366, 693 A.2d 360.

State, supra, </em>310 Md. at 577, 530 A.2d 743, the State then bears the burden of proving \u201cby clear and convincing evidence, the existence of reliability in the identification that outweighs the corrupting effect of the suggestive procedure.\u201d <em>Thomas v.

The following factors are relevant to whether, under the totality of the circumstances, the identification was reliable:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-7\">the opportunity of the witness to view the criminal at the time of the crime, the witness\u2019 degree of attention, the accuracy of the witness\u2019 prior description of the criminal, the level of certainty demonstrated by the witness at the confrontation, and the length of time between the crime and the confrontation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b147-8\"><em>Neil v.

However,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>not all impermissibly suggestive procedures call for exclusion, but only those impermissibly suggestive procedures that would <em>actually give rise to a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification. </em>Until a defendant establishes impermissive suggestiveness in the first instance as a basis for presumptive exclusion, therefore, <em>a court does not even inquire, </em>by looking at the suggested reliability factors, into whether the State is entitled to an exemption from that presumptive exclusion. The reliability inquiry, in short, is not an additional ground for exclusion but is, rather, a limitation on exclusion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b148-5\"><em>Conyers v.

Indeed, the scope of identification procedures constituting \u201cimpermissible suggestiveness\u201d is extremely narrow:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-6\">To do something impermissibly suggestive is not to pressure or browbeat a witness to make an identification but only to feed the witness clues as to which identification to make.

State, supra, </em>115 Md.App. at 366, 693 A.2d 360 (citing <em>Perkins v. State, </em>83 Md.App. 341, 346, 574 A.2d 356 (1990)).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-9\">On January 4, 5, and 8, 2001, the motion court held a hearing on all pending motions, including the appellant\u2019s motion to suppress identification evidence. The motion court denied the appellant\u2019s motion upon a finding that the procedure employed by the police in obtaining the identification was not impermissibly suggestive.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>The facts pertaining to the identification, as adduced at the motion hearing, were essentially undisputed, and showed the following. On April 25, 2000, Detective Paula Hamill showed Clark a photo array containing a picture of the appellant taken in June of 1994. Clark was unable to make an identification from the photo array. He testified at the motion hearing that he had been uncertain about whether the appellant\u2019s picture was among the photos he viewed. With respect to photo number 3, which was that of the appellant, Clark testified that he had thought that picture \u201ccould be one of the people, but I didn\u2019t want to say yeah, that\u2019s him for 100 percent and I didn\u2019t \u2014 and I wasn\u2019t 100 percent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">Three months later, on July 13, 2000, Clark was shown a videotaped lineup of several suspects, including the appellant. The appellant was the only person whose picture appeared in the photo array shown to Clark on April 25, 2000, and who also participated in the lineup. At the request of defense counsel, several adjustments were made to the lineup before it was shown to Clark: all of the participants were made to wear baseball caps to conceal their hair, were not permitted to wear white t-shirts, and were videotaped so their shoes were not visible. Clark identified the appellant from the lineup. At the motion hearing, Clark testified that he made his lineup selection based on his observations at the time of the shooting and not based on anything communicated to him by the police officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">In its written opinion and order, the motion court found these factors significant in denying the appellant\u2019s motion to suppress:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-7\">The Court notes that the photographs of the Defendants [referring to Barnett and the appellant] used in the arrays were several years old. There is nothing suggestive in the way the arrays were displayed to Michael Clark by police officers. It is also significant that Clark failed to identify either Defendant from the arrays. A time lapse of several months occurred between Clark\u2019s viewing of the photo arrays and the line-ups. The Court does not find that the display of the photographs tainted the line-up proceedings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>The videotapes [of the line-ups] and still photographs in evidence allow the Court to evaluate the composition of the line-ups and the identification procedure conducted by the State.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-5\">With regard to Defendant Jenkins, it is hard to envision how the State could improve upon the composition of the line-up. There is nothing in the record to support a conclusion that the line-up was unnecessarily suggestive. All-participants are similar in appearance, similarly dressed and wearing identical caps to eliminate the possibility that hairstyle would be used as the sole identifying characteristic.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">On appeal, the appellant argues that the fact that he was the only suspect to appear in both the photo array and the lineup \u201c[w]hile not dispositive ... is a factor in determining suggestiveness.\u201d <em>See United States v. Briley, </em>726 F.2d 1301, 1306-07 (8th Cir.1984) (the fact that the appellant was the only person to appear in both the photo spread and the line-up did not make the identification procedure <em>per se </em>suggestive. \u201cThis is but one factor to consider.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">While we agree that it was a factor, we also agree with the motion court that under the totality of the circumstances, the identification procedure in this case was not impermissibly suggestive. As the motion court explained, there was nothing about the videotaped line-up that pointed, to the appellant\u2014 the participants were made to look as similar to each other in appearance as possible. The only potentially suggestive feature \u2014 that the appellant\u2019s likeness/presence was included in both the photo array and the line-up, without any of the other participants likewise overlapping \u2014 would only be suggestive if there were some reason for Clark to notice it. There was no evidence that he did notice it, and the passage of several months between the presentation of the photo array and the line-up was such as to have made it highly unlikely that he would have noticed it. Accordingly, the motion court did not err in ruling that the appellant did not sustain his burden of showing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the identification procedure used by the police was unduly suggestive, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>and on that basis denying the appellant\u2019s motion to suppress Clark\u2019s extrajudicial and in-court identifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">The appellant contends that the sentencing court erred by not merging his conviction for first degree assault on Clark into his conviction for attempted first degree murder of Clark. He rests his argument on two Court of Appeals decisions: <em>Dixon v. State, </em>364 Md. 209, 772 A.2d 283 (2001), and <em>Williams v. State, </em>323 Md. 312, 593 A.2d 671 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">The State responds that the court properly imposed separate sentences for the two convictions because for purposes of merger the type of first degree assault the appellant was convicted of is not the same offense as attempted first degree murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\"> The doctrine of merger arises in part from the Fifth Amendment double jeopardy clause, which \u201cprohibits both successive prosecutions for the same offense as well as multiple punishment for the offense.\u201d <em>Dixon v. State, supra, </em>364 Md. at 236, 772 A.2d 283 (footnote omitted) (citing <em>Newton v. State, </em>280 Md. 260, 262-63, 373 A.2d 262 (1977)). The protections embodied in the Fifth Amendment apply to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>Dixon v. State, supra, </em>364 Md. at 236, 772 A.2d 283; <em>Nightingale v. State, </em>312 Md. 699, 702, 542 A.2d 373 (1988), <em>superseded by statute as stated in Fisher v. State, </em>367 Md. 218, 242, 786 A.2d 706 (2001).

First degree murder is \u201c[a]ll murder which shall be perpetrated by means of poison, or lying in wait, or by any kind of wilful, deliberate, and premeditated killing.\u201d Md.Code (1957, 1996 RepLVol., 2000 Supp.), art. 27, section 407. As the Court of Appeals has explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ah6\">The principles of law applicable to determining whether a felonious homicide constitutes a wilful, deliberate and premeditated murder are well settled. For a killing to be \u201cwilful\u201d there must be a specific purpose and intent to Mil; to be \u201cdeliberate\u201d there must be a full and conscious knowledge of the purpose to Mil; and to be \u201cpremeditated\u201d the design to Mil must have preceded the killing by an appreciable length of time, that is, time enough to be deliberate. It is unnecessary that the deliberation or premeditation shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>have existed for any particular length of time. Their existence is discerned from the facts of the case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b153-4\"><em>Tichnell v. State, </em>287 Md. 695, 717-18, 415 A.2d 830 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">The crime of attempt, which remains a common law offense, is \u201cthe intent to commit a crime coupled with some overt act beyond mere preparation in furtherance of the crime.\u201d <em>Hardy v. State, </em>301 Md. 124, 138-39, 482 A.2d 474 (1984). <em>See Lightfoot v. State, </em>278 Md. 231, 237, 360 A.2d 426 (1976).

State, supra, </em>301 Md. at 139, 482 A.2d 474.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">Thus, to be convicted of the crime of attempted first degree murder, an accused must be found to have attempted to commit first degree murder with the requisite intent required for conviction of first degree murder. \u201cIf the evidence satisfied the fact finder by proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the conduct of the defendant falls within the proscribed conduct in the statute labeled as first degree murder that did <em>not </em>result in death of the victim, then the crime of attempted murder in the first degree has been established.\u201d <em>Hardy v. State, supra, </em>301 Md. at 139-140, 482 A.2d 474 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">First degree assault is made punishable by Md.Code (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol., 2000 Supp.) article 27, section 12A-1. This section provides two modalities of first degree assault:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-8\">(a) <em>Serious physical injury; use of a firearm </em>\u2014 (1) A person may not intentionally cause or attempt to cause serious physical injury to another.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-9\">(2) A person may not commit an assault with a firearm, ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b153-10\">In <em>Dixon v. State, </em>the Court of Appeals held that under the \u201crequired evidence test,\u201d first degree assault of the (a)(1) modality merges into attempted voluntary manslaughter. The Court reasoned that the intent to kill required for a conviction for attempted voluntary manslaughter</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-11\">envelops the intent to do serious physical injury. Therefore, there is nothing required by modality (a)(1) of the first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>degree assault statute that is not <em>also </em>required by attempted voluntary manslaughter; the evidence required to show an attempt to kill would demonstrate causing, or attempting to cause, a serious physical injury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">364 Md. at 240, 772 A.2d 283 (emphasis added). The Court further held that first degree assault of the (a)(2) modality does not merge with attempted voluntary manslaughter, however, because use of a firearm is an element of that offense not required for attempted voluntary manslaughter, as manslaughter \u201c \u2018may be attempted by modalities or with instru-mentalities other than a firearm....\u2019\u201d <em>Dixon v. State, supra, </em>364 Md. at 241, 772 A.2d 283 (quoting <em>Dixon v. State, </em>133 Md.App. 325, 345, 755 A.2d 560 (2000)). Accordingly, first degree assault of the (a)(1) modality is a lesser included offense of attempted voluntary manslaughter while first degree assault of the (a)(2) modality is not. Because the Court in <em>Dixon </em>could not determine which of the first degree assault modalities the defendant had been convicted of, it resolved the ambiguity in his favor and merged the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">In this case, the record makes plain that the jury found the appellant guilty under the (a)(2) modality of first degree assault. The trial court instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-7\">An assault in the first degree is actually a higher form of assault in the second degree so let me first explain to you what assault in the second degree is. Assault in the second degree is an attempt to cause physical harm. In order to convict the defendant of assault, and this is assault in the second degree, the State must prove that the defendant actually tried to cause, immediate physical harm to Michael Clark, that the defendant intended to bring about physical harm and that the defendant\u2019s actions were not consented to by Michael Clark.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-8\">Now in order to find assault in the first degree, the State would have to prove all of the elements of assault in the second degree <em>and must also prove that the defendant used a firearm to commit assault in the second degree.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>(Emphasis added.) Accordingly, the jury must have found that the appellant used a firearm in the commission of the assault against Clark.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">Use of a firearm, a required element of first degree assault of the (a)(2) modality, is not a required element of attempted first degree murder. Likewise, because attempted first degree murder contains the elements of premeditation and deliberation, <em>see Williams v. State, supra, </em>323 Md. at 320, 593 A.2d 671, that offense has required elements not found in first degree assault of either modality. Thus, under the required evidence test, the appellant\u2019s conviction for first degree assault does not merge with his conviction for attempted first degree murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">The required evidence test is not the exclusive standard in Maryland for determining whether two offenses based on the same act or acts should merge. <em>See Williams v. State, supra, </em>323 Md. at 320, 593 A.2d 671; <em>White v. State, </em>318 Md. 740, 744, 569 A.2d 1271 (1990), superseded by statute as stated in <em>Fisher v. State, </em>367 Md. 218, 242, 786 A.2d 706 (2001). When a strict application of the required evidence test does not result in the merger of two offenses, courts in Maryland \u201chave applied as a principle of statutory construction the rule of lenity, which provides that doubt or ambiguity as to whether the legislature intended that there be multiple punishments for the same act or transaction will be resolved against turning a single transaction into multiple offenses.\u201d <em>Williams v. State, supra, </em>323 Md. at 321, 593 A.2d 671 (quoting <em>White v. State, supra, </em>318 Md. at 744, 569 A.2d 1271 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting <em>Simpson v. United States, </em>435 U.S. 6, 15, 98 S.Ct. 909, 55 L.Ed.2d 70 (1978))). The rule of lenity is intended to prevent courts from \u201cinterpreting a ... criminal statute so as to increase the penalty that it places on an individual when such an interpretation can be based on no more than a guess as to what [the legislature] intended.\u201d <em>Holbrook v. State, </em>364 Md. 354, 373, 772 A.2d 1240 (2001) (alterations in original) (quoting <em>Monoker v. State, </em>321 Md. 214, 222, 582 A.2d 525 (1990)).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>As with the required evidence test, the rule of lenity is applicable when both crimes are statutory, or when one offense is statutory and the other is a common law crime. <em>Holbrook v. State, supra, </em>364 Md. at 373, 772 A.2d 1240; <em>Monoker v. State, supra, </em>321 Md. at 223, 582 A.2d 525. Unlike the required evidence test, in which the lesser included offense merges into the greater offense, under the rule of lenity \u201cthere is a merger of penalties, not offenses, and the lesser penalty generally merges into the greater penalty.\u201d <em>Dixon v. State, supra, </em>364 Md. at 250, 772 A.2d 283 (internal quotations omitted) (citing <em>Spitzinger v. State, </em>340 Md. 114, 125, 665 A.2d 685 (1995)).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">In <em>Williams v. State, supra, </em>the Court held that under the rule of lenity, the defendant\u2019s two convictions for attempted first degree murder merged with his two convictions for assault with intent to murder. The defendant\u2019s convictions arose out of the same acts: his drenching two victims with gasoline and setting them on fire. The Court reasoned that under the required evidence test, the offenses did not merge because attempted first degree murder required proof of premeditation and deliberation, which assault with intent to murder did not, and assault with intent to murder required proof of an assault, which attempted first degree murder did not. <em>Williams v. State, supra, </em>323 Md. at 319-20, 593 A.2d 671. The Court concluded, however, that merger was required under the rule of lenity because the convictions arose out of the same acts and there was no suggestion \u201cin either statutory provisions or legislative history or the Court\u2019s opinions, that one of the purposes in establishing the offense of assault with intent to murder was to compound the punishment for attempted murder.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 322-23, 593 A.2d 671.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">In this case, like in <em>Williams, </em>the appellant\u2019s attempted first degree murder conviction and first degree assault conviction arose out of the same acts: his firing a handgun at Clark as Clark retreated from the scene. While we disagree, as we have explained, -with the appellant\u2019s assertion that the offenses merge under the \u201crequired evidence test,\u201d we conclude that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>the sentences should have been merged under the rule of lenity.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\">First degree assault of the (a)(2) modality is an attempt to cause, or actually causing, physical harm to another by use of a firearm. <em>See Lamb v. State, </em>93 Md.App. 422, 428-29, 613 A.2d 402 (1992) (holding that under Maryland common law, an \u201cassault\u201d is an attempted battery, an actual battery, or a combination of the two). Like first degree assault of the (a)(1) modality, it is an aggravated form of second degree, <em>i.e., </em>common law, assault. The aggravating factor in the (a)(1) modality is the intent to cause (or attempt to cause) <em>serious </em>physical injury; the aggravating factor in the (a)(2) modality is the use of a firearm \u2014 from which an intent to cause serious physical injury can be inferred.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">Here, the appellant was convicted of first degree assault for intentionally attempting to cause physical harm to Clark with a firearm. Attempted first degree murder, as we have explained, is an attempt to commit a willful, deliberate, and premeditated killing. The appellant was convicted of attempted first degree murder for attempting to willfully, deliberately, and premeditatedly kill Clark with a firearm, by means of the identical conduct constituting the first degree assault. Thus, on the facts in evidence and the instructions given by the trial court, the jury must have found that in firing at Clark the appellant was attempting to kill him (willfully, deliberately, and with premeditation) and was attempting to cause him physical harm with a firearm. It cuts too fine to say that, on the same set of facts, in a single transaction, the General Assembly intended separate punishments. Accordingly, under the rule of lenity, the appellant\u2019s sentence for first degree assault should have merged with his sentence for attempted first degree murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">y.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">Finally, the appellant contends that the evidence was insufficient to support his convictions. He argues that \u201cthe record is simply devoid of reliable evidence to establish <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>that [the appellant] was present at the time of the offense.\u201d According to the appellant, not only was Clark\u2019s identification of him rendered \u201cquestionable\u201d by Clark\u2019s admitted drug use the day of the shooting and his later inability to pick the appellant\u2019s photograph out of an array but also the defense presented evidence that proved that the appellant was not present at the scene on the night of the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">The appellant further argues that even assuming the jury \u00b0 reasonably could have concluded from the evidence that he was present at the time of the shooting, there was \u201ca dearth of evidence that he engaged in any criminal behavior.\u201d According to the appellant, the evidence adduced at trial merely showed that he was an innocent bystander, not that he was a participant in the commission of the crimes. Related to this argument, the appellant asserts that there was no evidence that he knew Clark would be present that night, and \u201c[t]hus, there simply [was] no evidence of a premeditated intent to kill him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">The State responds that there was sufficient evidence to establish the appellant\u2019s presence at the scene on the night of the shooting; that the appellant\u2019s claim that Clark\u2019s identification was not reliable is misplaced, as determinations as to the weight of the evidence and credibility of witnesses are properly left to the trier of fact; that the argument is without merit in any event as the evidence established that Clark\u2019s identification was reliable; and that there was sufficient evidence from which a rational trier of fact could find that the appellant participated in the commission of each of the crimes for which he was ultimately convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">The standard by which an appellate court reviews a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence is \u201cwhether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979) (emphasis in original). <em>Accord McMillian v. State, </em>325 Md. 272, 289-90, 600 A.2d 430 (1992); <em>Webber v. State, </em>320 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>Md. 238, 247-48, 577 A.2d 58 (1990); <em>Thomas v. State, </em>143 Md.App. 97, 121, 792 A.2d 368, <em>cert. denied, </em>369 Md. 573, 801 A.2d 1033 (2002). In considering the evidence in the record, the question is not \u201cwhether the evidence <em>should have </em>or <em>probably would have </em>persuaded the majority of fact finders but only whether it <em>possibly could have </em>persuaded <em>any </em>rational fact finder.\u201d <em>Fraidin v. State, </em>85 Md.App. 231, 241, 583 A.2d 1065 (1991) (emphasis in original). <em>See also Thomas v. State, supra, </em>143 Md.App. at 121, 792 A.2d 368.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">In addition, in performing our review of the evidence, we must be \u201cmindful of the respective roles of the court and the jury; it is the jury\u2019s task, not the court\u2019s, to measure the weight of evidence and to judge the credibility of witnesses.\u201d <em>Dawson v. State, </em>329 Md. 275, 281, 619 A.2d 111 (1993). <em>See McMillian v. State, supra, </em>325 Md. at 290, 600 A.2d 430. Indeed, the finder of fact, the jury in the instant case, is vested with the authority to \u201caccept that evidence which it believefs] and reject that which it d[oes] not.\u201d <em>Muir v. State, </em>64 Md.App. 648, 654, 498 A.2d 666 (1985), <em>aff'd, </em>308 Md. 208, 517 A.2d 1105 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">The record discloses sufficient evidence to support the appellant\u2019s convictions. With respect to appellant\u2019s contention that there was insufficient evidence for the jury to find he was present at the scene on the night in question, it is well established that the testimony of a single eyewitness is sufficient. <em>See Branch v. State, </em>305 Md. 177, 183, 502 A.2d 496 (1986); <em>Braxton v. State, </em>123 Md.App. 599, 671, 720 A.2d 27 (1998). Clark positively identified the appellant in court and in a lineup as the second individual present at the shooting. Clark provided the police with a description of the suspect immediately following the shooting. The description was consistent with the appellant\u2019s physical features. Without more, Clark\u2019s testimony was sufficient to permit a reasonable fact-finder to find that the appellant was present on the night of the shooting. The appellant\u2019s argument that Clark\u2019s identification testimony and evidence were unreliable goes to weight <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>and credibility, which, as stated above, were for the jury, not this Court, to decide.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">With respect to whether the evidence was sufficient to establish beyond a reasonable doubt the appellant\u2019s criminal agency, we will consider each of the crimes in turn. As noted above, the appellant was convicted as an aider and abettor to Barnett on charges of second degree murder and unlawful use of a handgun. The trial court instructed the jury that to convict the appellant of aiding and abetting, it had to find that the State had proved that the appellant had furthered the commission of the crimes \u201cby knowingly associating with the criminal venture with the intent to help commit the crime, by being present when the crime [was] committed and by seeking some act to make the crime succeed.\u201d It further instructed the jury that to return with a guilty verdict on those two counts, it had to find that the appellant \u201cwas present when the crime was committed and that [he] willfully participated with the intent to make the crime succeed.\u201d \u201c[P]resence need not always be an actual immediate standing by, within sight or hearing of the fact; but there may be also a constructive presence, as when one commits a robbery or murder and another keeps watch or guard at some convenient distance.\u201d <em>State v. Williamson, </em>282 Md. 100, 103, 382 A.2d 588 (1978) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">There was ample evidence introduced at trial from which a reasonable fact finder could conclude that the appellant aided and abetted Barnett in the commission of the crimes against Dorsey, and that he committed attempted first degree murder and first degree assault against Clark as a principal in the first degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">Clark testified that on the night of the shooting, he and Dorsey were walking up Douglas Street \u201cturning on to Spring\u201d when he saw the appellant and Barnett \u201c[c]oming off of Lynmore,\u201d farther up Spring Street. He explained that \u201cwhen we kept walking, ... they kept walking towards us. They crossed over in the middle of the street, and [Barnett] said [to Dorsey], \u2018Just the nigger I\u2019m looking for,\u2019 \u201d to which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>Dorsey responded, \u201cI still got that for you,\u201d with \u201ca smile on his face.\u201d No more words were exchanged.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">According to Clark, Barnett and the appellant \u201cwalked past [Clark and Dorsey].... [Barnett] stopped behind [Clark and Dorsey] like right here by the fence.\u201d The appellant \u201cstopped right here about the car \u2014 there was a car parked right here. He was standing there and kept holding his head down and wouldn\u2019t look at us in the eye, ...\u201d Clark stated that he knew Barnett had stopped behind him because \u201cI [was] looking behind me, too.\u201d Clark went on to say that he and Dorsey \u201cwere both looking behind us, and [Clark saw Barnett] start[ ] to reach [into his waistband].\u201d As Barnett started shooting, Clark and Dorsey \u201cstarted to run.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">Bullet fragments and spent shell casings were found at the scene. Ballistics evidence showed that seven of the casings came from a .32 millimeter handgun later recovered from Barnett\u2019s residence. Three bullet fragments from the same .32 millimeter gun were recovered from Dorsey\u2019s body and clothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">Seven additional shell casings from a nine millimeter handgun also were found at the scene: three in the vicinity of Dorsey\u2019s body and four in the area to which Clark fled when the shooting started. The nine millimeter handgun later was recovered from the trunk of a vehicle belonging to Oskalia Barnes, the boyfriend of the appellant\u2019s sister. Barnes testified that sometime in June of 2000, the appellant had given him the nine millimeter handgun to hold, stating that \u201cBlack\u201d {Barnett} was in trouble.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">It is well established that \u201cproof of guilt based in whole or in part on circumstantial evidence is no different from proof of guilt based on direct eyewitness accounts.\u201d <em>Eiland v. State, </em>92 Md.App. 56, 67, 607 A.2d 42 (1992), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds sub nom., Tyler v. State, </em>330 Md. 261, 623 A.2d 648 (1993). Although there was no direct evidence that the appellant fired either of the weapons recovered in connection with these crimes, there was ample circumstantial evidence to permit the rational inference that the appellant was a willing participant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>who acted with the intent to make the crimes succeed and the further rational inference that he participated as a shooter.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">Logically, it is unlikely that Barnett fired two guns simultaneously at the fleeing victims. Clark testified that he and Dorsey ran in separate directions when the shooting started. The ballistics evidence showed that shots from the two handguns were fired in opposing directions. Thus, there was evidence from which reasonable jurors could find that the appellant participated as a principal.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">Likewise, the evidence was sufficient for a reasonable fact-finder to conclude that the appellant committed the crimes of attempted first degree murder and first degree assault against Clark. As stated above, the trial court instructed the jury that in order to find the appellant guilty of first degree assault, it had to find that the State had proven that the appellant intended and \u201cactually tried to cause immediate [nonconsensual] physical harm to Michael Clark,\u201d and that he had used a firearm to commit the assault. <em>See </em>article 27, section 12A-1. Even in the absence of direct eyewitness evidence that the appellant fired the nine millimeter gun, the circumstantial evidence adduced supported the State\u2019s theory that the appellant shot at Clark with the nine millimeter gun as he was retreating by showing both the intent and the actual attempt to cause Clark immediate physical harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">The evidence also was sufficient to support the appellant\u2019s conviction for attempted first degree murder of Clark. The trial court properly instructed the jury that first degree murder is the intentional killing of another person with willful deliberation and premeditation. The court went on to instruct that to find that the appellant <em>attempted </em>to commit first degree murder, the jury would have to find that he made \u201ca substantial step beyond the preparation for the commission of murder in the first degree.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">Contrary to the appellant\u2019s argument, the evidence did not establish that he lacked sufficient time to form the requisite premeditation to kill Clark. Premeditation does not require a specific lapse of time between the thought and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>the action. The State need only show that there was \u201ctime enough to deliberate.\u201d <em>Tichnell v. State, </em>287 Md. 695, 717, 415 A.2d 830 (1980). In other words, premeditation can be inferred \u201c(i]f the killing results from a choice made as the result of thought, however short the struggle between the intention and the act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 718, 415 A.2d 830. In <em>Tichnell, </em>evidence that the defendant fired multiple shots was sufficient to establish premeditation and deliberation on his part. <em>Id. </em>at 719, 415 A.2d 830. <em>See also Hunt v. State, </em>345 Md. 122, 161, 691 A.2d 1255 (1997). (\u201cthe delay between firing a first and second shot is enough time for reflection and decision to justify a finding of premeditation and deliberation.\u201d); <em>Robeson v. State, </em>39 Md.App. 365, 381, 386 A.2d 795 (1978) (\u201c[T]he firing of two shots separated by an interval of time, ... has been held to be sufficient evidence of deliberation and premeditation\u201d), <em>aff'd on other grounds, </em>285 Md. 498, 403 A.2d 1221 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">Here, the ballistics evidence showed that four shots from the nine millimeter handgun were fired in the direction in which Clark fled. Thus, a reasonable fact finder could have concluded that there was \u201ctime enough\u201d for the appellant to premeditate and deliberate before firing the weapon multiple times. In addition, the presence of the four spent casings provided sufficient evidence that the appellant took a \u201csubstantial step beyond preparation toward the commission of murder in the first degree.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">SENTENCE VACATED AS TO FIRST DEGREE ASSAULT CONVICTION. JUDGMENTS OTHERWISE AFFIRMED. COSTS TO BE PAID BY THE APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b124-7\">. The court also rejected two additional arguments advanced by the appellant: 1) that by denying him the right to attend the emergency hearing at which Pikulski and McDonald testified, the court denied him his right to be present at a \"critical stage\" of the proceedings so as to assist his counsel; and 2) that the holding in <em>Dingle v. State, </em>361 Md. 1, 759 A.2d 819 (2000), somehow mandated that the court grant the appellant a new trial under the circumstances. The appellant has not raised these issues on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b126-7\">. The harmless error standard set forth in <em>Dorsey v. State </em>is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-8\">When an appellant, in a criminal case, establishes error, unless a reviewing court, upon its own independent review of the record, is able to declare a belief, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the error in no way influenced the verdict, such error cannot be deemed \"harmless\u201d and a reversal is mandated. Such reviewing court must thus be satisfied that there is no reasonable possibility that the evidence complained of \u2014 whether erroneously admitted or excluded \u2014 may have contributed to the rendition of the guilty verdict.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b126-9\">276 Md. at 659.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b127-7\">. In <em>Wemsing, </em>the Court of Appeals applied an abuse of discretion standard in reviewing the denial of a motion for new trial. In that case, a complex personal injury action, the defendant filed a motion for new trial after discovering that the jury had taken a dictionary into the jury room and had consulted it in the course of deliberating on the issue of proximate cause. The Court held that the denial of the motion for new trial was properly reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard, and that the \u201cdegree of probable prejudice [was] so great that it was an abuse of discretion to deny a new trial.\u201d <em>Wernsing v. General Motors Corp., supra, </em>298 Md. at 420, 470 A.2d 802.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b128-6\">. If the State had consented, the appellant could have opted to proceed with only eleven jurors, under Md. Rule 4-311(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b135-7\">. We also found that under the \u201cinvited error doctrine,\u201d it was not improper for the trial court to deny David's motion for mistrial and, in any event, the jury contact did not prejudice him. <em>Allen v. State, supra, </em>89 Md.App. at 46-47, 597 A.2d 489.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b143-7\">. In addition, the State argued at trial that the statements were relevant to the conspiracy charge against the appellant, for which he was later found not guilty.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b144-6\">. The appellant also argued that the statements were hearsay that were not admissible under Md. Rule 5-803(a)(5), which does not exclude as hearsay statements by a party\u2019s co-conspirator during and in furtherance of a conspiracy. The trial court declined to reach this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b146-9\">. The appellant did not object to the contents of the curative instruction or ask the court to expound further. Accordingly, the appellant did not preserve his argument that the curative instruction \u201chad little success in remedying the error.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b152-7\">. The \"required evidence test\u201d is derived from the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Blockburger v.
