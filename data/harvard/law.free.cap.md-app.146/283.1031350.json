The appeal concerns an application submitted by Eastern Outdoor Advertising Company (\u201cEastern\u201d), appellant and cross-appel-lee, for a conditional use permit to erect a double-faced, illuminated general advertising billboard in the Mt. Vernon area of Baltimore City, a designated urban renewal district. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>Ruth Wolf Rehfeld, appellee and cross-appellant, a resident of Mt. Vernon and a member of the Mt. Vernon Belvedere Association, was permitted to intervene at the agency level to protest the erection of the billboard. Following a hearing on December 5, 2000, the Baltimore City Board of Municipal and Zoning Appeals (\u201cBMZA\u201d or the \u201cBoard\u201d), appellee and cross-appellant, denied appellant\u2019s application for the second time.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">Thereafter, appellant sought judicial review in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. That court (Cannon, J.) reversed and remanded. Although the court was satisfied that the Board was entitled to hear new evidence following an earlier remand, it concluded that the Board\u2019s decision was not supported by adequate factual findings. Accordingly, the circuit court again remanded to the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">From that ruling, Eastern noted this appeal, presenting the following issue for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-6\">In view of the Mandate of the Court of Special Appeals and the Order of Remand by the Circuit Court of Baltimore City, directing <em>further consideration of the record, </em>did the Board err in accepting, considering and basing its disapproval on additional testimony and evidence?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">Appellees have submitted separate briefs, in which they present similar questions. In addition to asking a question akin to the one posed by appellant, they ask, in essence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AHU\">Did the circuit court err in remanding the matter to the Board for a second time, when the Board\u2019s findings of fact were sufficient to warrant denial of the application for conditional use?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-8\">For the reasons that follow, we shall affirm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b312-9\">FACTUAL SUMMARY</p>\n<p id=\"b312-10\">In late 1996, Eastern filed an application with the Board to obtain approval to erect a double-faced illuminated, general advertising sign, 14 feet by 48 feet, with a height of 90 feet, at 808 Guilford Avenue, located in the Mt. Vernon Urban Renewal Area, a B-5-1 zoning district. The site is improved by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>mini-shopping center and a parking lot. The proposed billboard was to be located in the parking lot of the strip center, in space leased by Eastern. The lot fronts on the west side of Guilford Avenue, which runs parallel to a highway known as the Jones Falls Expressway or 1-83. One side of the proposed advertising sign would face the Jones Falls Expressway, and be visible to traffic proceeding on the highway, while the other side would face the expanse of the Mt. Vernon neighborhood.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">General advertising signs or billboards are permitted as conditional uses in a B-5-1 District, upon compliance with certain criteria set forth in the Baltimore City Zoning Code, and subject to approval by the Board. <em>See </em>Baltimore City Zoning Code 2000 (the \u201cOrdinance\u201d). After the Board held a hearing on Eastern\u2019s application on November 18, 1997, it rejected Eastern\u2019s application on the grounds that: 1) the billboard failed to meet the conditional use standards set forth in the Zoning Code; 2) the sign was prohibited by the Mt. Vernon Urban Renewal Plan (the \u201cPlan\u201d), and therefore it would have had a greater adverse impact at the proposed location than it would have if placed elsewhere in the B-5 zoning district; 3)the total square footage of the billboard, which measured 1,344 square feet, exceeded the allowed maximum of 900 square feet.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">By Order dated July 27, 1998, the circuit court (Quarles, J.) affirmed. Appellant then lodged an appeal to this Court. In a comprehensive opinion authored by Judge Harrell, we reversed and remanded. <em>See Eastern Outdoor Advertising Company v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>128 Md. App. 494, 739 A.2d 854 (1999) <em>(\u201cEastern I </em>\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>358 Md. 163, 747 A.2d 644 (2000). In <em>Eastern I, </em>we reiterated that \u201ca proposed conditional use is <em>prima facie </em>valid absent any fact or circumstance negating that presumption.\u201d <em>Eastern I, </em>128 Md.App. at 525, 739 A.2d 854. The Court also noted that an urban renewal plan \u201cis merely a guiding factor, not a dispositive factor, to consider in deciding whether to grant a conditional use permit,\u201d but Was not binding on the BMZA. <em>Id. </em>at 524, 739 A.2d 854 (citing <em>Richmarr Holly Hills, Inc. v. American PCS, L.P., </em>117 Md.App. 607, 640, 701 A.2d 879 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number><em>(1997)). </em>Thus, we ruled that the Board incorrectly determined that the restrictions in the Plan, which prohibited billboards in that area, amended the provisions of the Ordinance, which otherwise allowed billboards as a conditional use in the zoning district. <em>Id. </em>at 519, 739 A.2d 854. The Court found no \u201cmandate\u201d in the Plan that prohibited the Board from granting a conditional use permit. <em>Id. </em>at 524, 739 A.2d 854.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">Further, the Court determined that the Board\u2019s factual findings were insufficient with respect to the matter of adverse impact. <em>Id. </em>at 517, 739 A.2d 854. In the Court\u2019s view, the absence of adequate factual findings denied Eastern \u201cits fundamental right to know the reasons for the denial of the conditional use permit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 516, 739 A.2d 854. Mere conclusions, \u201c \u2018without pointing to the facts ... that form the basis for its ... conclusion,\u2019 \u201d were not enough. <em>Id. </em>at 530 (citations omitted). In addition, the Court concluded that the circuit court improperly affirmed the Board on grounds other than the ones relied on by the Board. Therefore, the Court remanded to the Board \u201cfor further consideration of the record not inconsistent with [the Court\u2019s] opinion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 532, 739 A.2d 854.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">Frank Legambi, Executive Director of the Board, subsequently wrote a letter to Eastern on February 1, 2001, stating, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-7\">[T]he Court\u2019s ruling merely requires that the Board consider the record and make appropriate findings. It does not require that another hearing be held.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">While the City\u2019s Petition for Certiorari was pending, it filed a motion in circuit court to stay our remand to the Board. In that motion, the City said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-9\">Pursuant to this Court\u2019s Order and the Judgment of the Court of Special Appeals, the Board must now consider the record and set forth findings of fact based on that record.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b314-10\">Nevertheless, the Board subsequently scheduled a hearing for November 14, 2000, at which it planned to receive additional evidence. Through counsel, appellant responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>This is a new record which the Board is now attempting to make. It is improper under the law and we would object to any testimony. We would object to anything other than what you\u2019ve been directed to do from the Court of Special Appeals.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-4\">When the Board convened a second hearing, appellant objected to the Board\u2019s decision to reopen the record. Eastern claimed that the new factual findings should be made on the basis of the original record. Nevertheless, the Board determined to receive additional evidence, which included letters and testimony from City officials and community associations protesting Eastern\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">The evidence adduced at the first hearing is summarized in <em>Eastern I </em>and need not be repeated here at length. In reaching its decision, the Board also considered the additional evidence adduced at the second hearing, which we will summarize below.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">Susan Williams, Chief of Current Planning for the Baltimore City Planning Department, testified that the proposed billboard would have a negative impact in the area. In addition to presenting slides and photographs, Williams said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A2O\">First of all, the urban renewal amendment for the Mount Vernon urban renewal plan as last amended by the Mayor and City Council in 1993, does not list general advertising signs as a permitted use. The urban renewal plans, just like our zoning code, if the use is not listed, it is not allowed. Secondly, we\u2019d like to outline that this shopping center is a very unique case in a B-5.1 district. It is highly unusual to have a shopping center with parking in front of the stores in B-5.1, and the Planning Department staff cannot think of any other case in the B-5.1 district other than a service station or an automobile related facility that has this particular type of design with the parking essentially in the front of the building.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-7\">For the record we\u2019d also like to note in the B-5.1 district that most of the general advertising signs are affixed to the side of buildings and they are not free-standing signs that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>rise way above the buildings, and that is ease is [sic] a majority of downtown.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ar-dedup-0\">We also think it\u2019s important for this Board to note that this particular shopping center was created as a quaint village-style shopping area. It is primarily one-story with only one section being two-story, and I have photos of the center that ... show its unique characteristic for a downtown or urban area.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">Ms. Williams also expressed concern as to the precise location of the billboard, but acknowledged that there were \u201cproblems\u201d with all locations. Further, she said that the \u201clights from this particular sign ... would be on all night,\u201d disturbing a residential courtyard in the vicinity.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">The Board also received a letter of October 26, 2000, from Kathleen Kotarba, Executive Director of the Baltimore City Commission for Historical and Architectural Preservation (\u201cCHAP\u201d). Characterizing the Washington Monument as \u201cnationally significant,\u201d and Mount Vernon Place and the area as \u201csacred,\u201d Kotarba opposed the erection of the billboard as \u201cdetrimental to the preservation of cultural and historic landmarks in the Mount Vernon area.\u201d The report articulated several grounds in support of CHAP\u2019s contention that the proposed billboard violated applicable zoning regulations, including the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-7\">1) <em>The proposed location of the signboard mil adversely affect histomcal and architectural preservation in the Mount Vernon Area. </em>The proposed location is adjacent to the eastern boundary of the Mount Vernon Historic District, Baltimore\u2019s first and premiere historic area.... The Mount Vernon area is significant for its fine architecture and public squares, and associations with historically important people and events. Mount Vernon Place is a unique American square that is distinguished in shape and design from any other urban place in the country. Monuments, including the nationally significant Washington Monument, are part of the context and vista of this sacred area. <em>The proposed signboard mil obscure vistas of the monuments and archi-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number><em>lecture of Mount Vernon. It will disrupt view [sic] of the historic fabric of the neighborhood and discourage appreciation of its history and culture.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-4\">2) <em>As a structure, it is not compatible with the size, scale and quality of design of the adjacent historic buildings. </em>The adjacent historic district contains a concentration of Baltimore\u2019s finest nineteenth and early twentieth century structures. Outstanding design and craftsmanship is the standard in Mount Vernon.... <em>The proposed signboard (Ilf </em>x <em>]8) is out of keeping with the character of the area due to its size, scale and shape which is unlike that of the historic surroundings.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-5\">3) <em>This neighborhood is included in Baltimore\u2019s Recognized Heritage Area, and the proposed signboard will impair the present and future development of the Heritage Area </em>.... <em>The proposed signboard, adjacent to the Target Investment Zone, will negate the efforts of the cultural and historical institutions by projecting an unsightly commercial presence that is atypical of the true qualities of the area. We are concerned that future economic development of Mount Vernon as a Cultural District may be impeded by the distraction created by a structure that is obviously out of character.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">The Board also received a memorandum from Charles Graves, Director of the Baltimore City Department of Planning (\u201cPlanning\u201d), dated August 7, 2000, updating a memorandum of January 17, 1997. Graves recommended disapproval of Eastern\u2019s application, claiming that general advertising signs are not \u201cpermitted uses\u201d under the Plan. Graves made numerous points; we have summarized them, using quotations as indicated.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-7\">1. \u201c[M]ost general advertising signs in the B-5-1 zoning district are affixed to the side of a building, and are not free-standing ... [T]he freestanding nature of this proposed sign combined with the height ... makes [it] incompatible with the surrounding area.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>2. The proposed site is \u201cunique\u201d because it was \u201cdesigned to create a quaint \u2018village-style\u2019 shopping area.\u201d The buildings are generally one-story, and a billboard \u201cplaced in the center\u201d of the area would have a \u201csignificant negative impact on this \u2018village style\u2019 shopping niche.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-4\">3. The applicant has not shown the precise location of the proposed sign. But, if the sign is placed on one of the islands in the center of the parking lot of the shopping area, it would \u201ceither require removal of landscaping or block the pedestrian paths designed to allow people to walk safely from the parking spaces or nearby public sidewalks to the stores.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-5\">4. The \u201cconstant lights\u201d from such a \u201ctall sign\u201d will \u201cshine into the garden area\u201d and front windows of the adjacent residences and into the rear windows of the properties located west of the center.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">Charles Duff, of the Midtown Development Corporation, testified at the first hearing. He reiterated at the second hearing that the proposed billboard would have an adverse impact on the neighborhood.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">Ms. Rehfeld also testified. She claimed: \u201cThe plat submitted to the BMZA for this new hearing ... is significantly different from the plat that was submitted with the original application for this conditional use.\u201d Although the \u201cnew plat\u201d showed that the two faces of the billboard were parallel, and presumably within two feet of each other, she maintained that the \u201cnew plat\u201d was a \u201cmaterial change,\u201d and therefore appellant had submitted a new application.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-8\">Board Chairman Benjamin Neil, Esquire, indicated that the plat showing parallel faces of the signboard had been submitted as an exhibit at the first hearing for the applicant, but apparently \u201cit was not marked previously....\u201d In any event, the correct plat was submitted in evidence at the second hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-9\">The Board \u201cdisapprove^] the application,\u201d by a tie vote of two to two, in a decision of December 5, 2000. It found that the proposed sign was \u201cback to back on a single pole measur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>ing 14 feet by 48 feet with a total square footage of 672 feet,\u201d and thus the size satisfied former \u00a7 10.0-3c. Nevertheless, it found \u201cthat authorizing the billboard at this particular location would be detrimental to the general welfare of the residents and business of the Mount Vernon community and would be contrary to the public interest.\u201d In its opinion, the Board said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-5\">[T]he Board made their findings based on the record as well as additional testimony to clarify the issues of the plat/size of sign and the Mount Vernon Historic District.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-6\">In compliance with the court\u2019s request, the Board in order to clarity the dispute in the size of the sign asked the appellant\u2019s attorney which of the Plats submitted in this case was the correct one. The attorney identified the Plat measuring approximately 8/6 inches by 11 inches showing the faces of the sign facing directly north and south 14 feet by 48 feet on a single pole 90 feet in height with a square footage of 672 square feet. The appellant\u2019s attorney confirmed that the testimony ... was in reference to exhibit 1 which would be the Plat as identified above as the correct Plat. It was indicated the other Plat in the file measuring 10-/6 inches x 17 inches was not exhibit 1... . The Board found that the original Plat filed was mistakenly used in. determining the square footage of the sign, and should have been disregarded and replaced with exhibit A. On the issue of whether a conditional use should be granted, the Board considered the prior record and additional testimony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">The Board specifically credited the evidence submitted by CHAP and by Planning, which discussed the unique nature of the Mt. Vernon area and the negative impact resulting from the billboard. The Board also stated that it \u201cfound persuasive\u201d the letters and testimony from individuals and community organizations, which confirmed the unique and historic nature of the area. The Board reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>For example: Ms. Kathleen G. Kotarba, Executive Director of (CHAP), stated in a letter submitted to the BMZA as follows: \u201cMount Vernon Place is a unique American square that is distinguished in shape and design from any other urban place in the country ... The proposed signboard will obscure vistas of the monuments and architecture of Mount Vernon. It would disrupt view of the historic fabric of the neighborhood and discourage appreciation of its history and culture ... The proposed signboard is out of keeping with the character of the area due to its size, scale and shape which is unlike that of the historic surroundings ... We are concerned that future economic development of Mount Vernon as a Cultural District may be impeded by the distraction created by a structure that is obviously out of character.\u201d The Baltimore City Department of Planning likewise submitted a written report that discussed the unique nature of the site and the negative impact the billboard would have on the neighborhood. These agencies are disinterested parties who carefully considered these issues, and in this case the Board credits their testimony regarding the nature of the neighborhood. Further, the Board found persuasive the letters and testimony from individuals and community organizations from the local community who confirmed the unique historic nature of the neighborhood and the unique negative impact that a billboard would have on the aesthetic, residential, and economic enjoyment of the neighborhood. The Board believed the testimony of the many resident, businesses, community organizations and cultural institutions who have been active in the area for a long time when they testified regarding the character of the neighborhood and the impact of the proposed billboard. The Board was not swayed by the testimony and the materials from the appellants [sic], who have a clear economic self-interest that lessens their objectivity, the evidence and argument presented by the appellants were insufficient to undermine the Board\u2019s finding that the site is in a unique historic location and that the billboard would be detrimental to the neighborhood.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">The Board concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>The Board finds that the proposed location is in a uniquely historic setting near Mount Vernon Square, one of the most important and historic settings in the City of Baltimore. The Board concludes, after consideration of all of the criteria specified in law and based on the size of the proposed billboard, the nature of the surrounding area, the proximity of historic residences and public spaces, the value of preservation of cultural and historic landmarks, and provisions of the applicable Urban Renewal Plan, that a conditional use for the proposed billboard should not be granted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">Following the denial of its application, Eastern sought review in the circuit court. On May 14, 2001, the circuit court ruled that the Board did not err or violate the instructions of the Court of Special Appeals in hearing new evidence. In its nineteen page opinion, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-5\">This Court is not persuaded that the language of the remand prohibited the Board from reopening the record. ... The board may well have decided that it needed more evidence to make the findings required by the Court of Special Appeals and <em>[Maryland State Police v.] Zeigler </em>[330 Md. 540, 625 A.2d 914 (1993) ] clearly would have permitted it to reopen the record before issuing its first final decision, even after beginning deliberations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">Nevertheless, after a thorough review of each factual finding of the Board, the circuit court determined that the Board\u2019s findings of fact were merely conclusory, speculative, or \u201cbald assertion[s].\u201d It said: \u201cThe Board has once again issued a decision that is replete with conclusions, without \u2018pointing to the facts found by the [Board] that form the basis for its ... conclusion^].\u2019 \u201d (Citing <em>Eastern I, </em>128 Md.App. at 530, 739 A.2d 854). In its view, the BMZA did not perform a \u201c \u2018proper judicial review.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>Therefore, the court remanded to the Board, directing it to make \u201cspecific factual findings to support the conclusions in the December 3, 2000 decision....\u201d In doing so, however, the court expressly prohibited the Board \u201cfrom [again] reopening the record.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">We shall include additional facts in our discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">\u201cA proceeding on a special exception is subject to a full judicial review.\u201d <em>Alviani v. Dixon, </em>365 Md. 95, 107, 775 A.2d 1234 (2001). However, judicial review of an administrative agency\u2019s decision is narrow. <em>Total Audio-Visual Systems, Inc. v. Department of Labor, Licensing and Regulation, </em>360 Md. 387, 394, 758 A.2d 124 (2000); <em>Meadows of Greenspring Homeowners Ass\u2019n v. Foxleigh Ent. Inc., </em>133 Md.App. 510, 514, 758 A.2d 611 (2000). Moreover, because the appeal is from the decision of an administrative agency, we review the decision of the BMZA, not the decision of the circuit court. <em>Jordan Towing, Inc. v. Hebbville Auto Repair, Inc., </em>369 Md. 439, 450, 800 A.2d 768 (2002); <em>Gigeous v. ECI, </em>363 Md. 481, 495-96, 769 A.2d 912 (2001); <em>Uninsured Employers\u2019 Fund v.

As to an agency\u2019s final decision, we consider \u201c \u2018(1) the legality of the decision and (2) whether there was substantial evidence from the record as a whole to support the decision.\u2019 \u201d <em>State Highway Admin. v.

Hider, </em>349 Md. 71, 78, 706 A.2d 1073 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">An agency\u2019s factual findings are binding upon a reviewing court, so long as they are supported by substantial evidence in the record. <em>United Parcel Serv., Inc. v. People\u2019s Counsel, </em>336 Md. 569, 577, 650 A.2d 226 (1994); <em>Mortimer v. Howard Research, </em>83 Md.App. 432, 441, 575 A.2d 750, <em>cert. denied, </em>321 Md. 164, 582 A.2d 499 (1990).

Dep\u2019t of Public Safety, </em>330 Md. 187, 212, 623 A.2d 198 (1993). \u201cBecause of the deference [we must] accord [to] the expertise of an administrative agency acting within the sphere of its regulated activities, we refrain from making our own independent findings of fact or substituting our judgment for that of the agency when the record contains substantial evidence supporting the agency\u2019s determination.\u201d <em>Marsheck v.

Banks, </em>354 Md. 59, 68-69, 729 A.2d 376 (1999). Further, the tasks of drawing inferences from the evidence and resolving conflicts in the evidence are exclusively the function of the agency. <em>Motor Vehicle Administration v. Karwacki, </em>340 Md. 271, 283, 666 A.2d 511 (1995). As the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>Court said in <em>Snowden v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>224 Md. 443, 168 A.2d 390 (1961), \u201c \u2018The Court may not substitute its judgment on the question whether the inference drawn is the right one or whether a different inference would be better supported. The test is reasonableness, not rightness.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 448, 168 A.2d 390 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">In contrast, we do not defer to the agency\u2019s legal conclusions. In other words, we are not bound by the Board\u2019s interpretation of the law. <em>Gigeous, </em>363 Md. at 496, 769 A.2d 912; <em>Baltimore Lutheran, </em>302 Md. at 662, 490 A.2d 701. Rather, \u201cwhen the question before the <em>agency </em>involves one of statutory interpretation or an issue of law, our review is more expansive.\u201d <em>Muddiman, </em>120 Md.App. at 734, 708 A.2d 47. \u201cEven with regard to some legal issues, [however,] a degree of deference should often be accorded the position of the administrative agency.\u201d <em>Banks, </em>354 Md. at 69, 729 A.2d 376. Therefore, \u201can administrative agency\u2019s interpretation and application of the statute which the agency administers should ordinarily be given considerable weight by reviewing courts.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">Appellant argues that, on remand, the Board was \u201cplainly wrong\u201d in receiving additional evidence, rather than confining its review to the existing record. Eastern maintains that the mandate in <em>Eastern I, </em>which ordered a remand \u201cfor further consideration of the record not inconsistent with this opinion,\u201d expressly required the Board to limit its review to the original record.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">Eastern also rejects appellees\u2019 contention that it benefitted from the Board\u2019s decision to reopen the matter for new evidence, because only then was it able to establish the dimensions of the proposed billboard, to show that the sign conformed to the size set forth in the Ordinance. It asserts in its reply brief: <em>\u201cThe Zoning Board merely corrected the record by marking as an Exhibit a drawing of the sign, which has been introduced by Appellant at the first </em>hearing.\u201d In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>support of its position, appellant points to the letter of February 1, 2000, from the Board\u2019s Executive Director; the pleading of the Board\u2019s attorney; the timely objections of Eastern\u2019s counsel; and the view of the Board\u2019s chairman that the receipt of additional evidence contravened the Court\u2019s ruling in <em>Eastern I.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">Eastern also relies on the following language from <em>Belvoir Farms Homeowners Association, Inc. v. North, </em>355 Md. 259, 270, 734 A.2d 227 (1999), to support is contention that the Board was not entitled to receive additional evidence on remand.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-5\">Generally, when an administrative agency utilizes an erroneous standard and some evidence exists, however minimal, that could be considered appropriately under the correct standard, the case should be remanded so the agency can reconsider the evidence using the correct standard. The Board, in its findings, may have considered only as much of the evidence before it as necessary, in its view, to authorize the grant of a variance based upon the lesser practical difficulties standard. Additional, unconsidered evidence before the Board may have supported the grant of the variance, even under the stricter unwarranted hardship standard.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">In our view, appellant\u2019s reliance on <em>Belvoir </em>is misplaced. We do not construe the passage quoted above as a dictate precluding an agency from receiving additional evidence on remand. Put another way, <em>Belvoir </em>does not demand that, on remand, the agency must limit its review to the record already in existence. We conclude that, on remand, the BMZA was entitled to supplement the existing record with additional relevant evidence. We explain further.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">In <em>Belvoir, </em>the Chairman of the Chesapeake Bay Critical Area Commission petitioned the circuit court for review of a decision granting a variance for additional boat slips at a community pier. The circuit court reversed. The Court of Appeals concluded that the Anne Arundel County Board of Zoning Appeals used an incorrect standard in determining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>unwarranted hardship in granting a variance from critical area zoning regulations. <em>Id. </em>at 282, 734 A.2d 227. Therefore, the Court vacated the circuit court\u2019s ruling and remanded to the Board to reconsider the evidence. In effect, the Court agreed with the lower court\u2019s reversal, but noted that \u201cthe more appropriate remedy would have been for the circuit court to remand the case to the Board for further review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 270, 734 A.2d 227.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">In our research, we have failed to uncover any case that suggests that the Board could not conduct further evidentiary proceedings under the circumstances attendant here. Ordinarily, an administrative agency has wide discretion to reopen a case even after it has begun to deliberate. In <em>Maryland State Police v. Zeigler, </em>330 Md. 540, 557, 625 A.2d 914 (1993), the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-5\">[I]t is an established principle that an administrative agency has broad .discretion to consider evidence submitted after the close of an evidentiary hearing as long as there is compliance with procedural due process.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-6\"># <em>Hi </em>*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-7\">The discretion of an administrative agency to admit evidence after the hearing is arguably broader than the discretion that is generally accorded to trial judges____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">We are also guided by <em>Halle Companies v. Crofton Civic Association, </em>339 Md. 131, 661 A.2d 682 (1995), although that case is distinguishable from the one sub judice. In <em>Halle Companies, </em>the Court recognized that the Anne Arundel County Board of Appeals engaged in de novo review of a special exception application that had previously been submitted to the County\u2019s Department of Planning. The Court concluded that, in its de novo review, the agency was entitled to consider \u201cnew and additional evidence....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 142, 661 A.2d 682. The Court reasoned: \u201c[T]he Board conducts wholly original proceedings with regard to all issues properly before it, and may consider new and additional evidence beyond that introduced before the administrative hearing officer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>145, 661 A.2d 682. See also <em>Mary Elizabeth Ginn, et al. v. John A. Farley, </em>43 Md.App. 229, 236, 403 A.2d 858 (1979) (stating that \u201c[ a] zoning board, along with other administrative agencies, is generally not bound by the technical rules of evidence although it must observe fundamental fairness in dealing with the parties who appear before it.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">Our view that the Board had discretion to receive additional evidence upon remand, under the circumstances attendant here, is consistent with federal practice. As early as 1939, the Supreme Court said, in <em>Ford Motor Company v. Nat\u2019l Labor Relations Board, </em>305 U.S. 364, 59 S.Ct. 301, 83 L.Ed. 221 (1939):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-5\">[I]t is well established that the court may remand the cause to the Commission for further proceedings to the end that valid and essential findings may be made ... [The remand] means simply that the case is returned to the administrative body in order that it may take further action in accordance with the applicable law.... <em>If further evidence is necessary and available to supply the basis for findings on material points, that evidence may be taken.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 373-74, 59 S.Ct. 301 (Internal citations omitted) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">We are further convinced that the Board did not err in receiving additional evidence when we consider, by analogy, the discretion generally afforded to a trial court upon remand. <em>Powell v. Maryland Aviation Administration, </em>336 Md. 210, 222, 647 A.2d 437 (1994), is instructive. There, the Court said: \u201cOrdinarily, a reversal and remand after trial for error in the trial or decision results in a retrial, unless the appellate opinion or mandate specifically limits the proceedings on remand.\u201d Moreover, a trial judge has broad discretion to reopen a case and that discretion will not be disturbed on appeal, \u201c \u2018except where [the judge\u2019s] action is arbitrary and the rights of some of the parties are improperly affected.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cooper v. Sacco, </em>357 Md. 622, 637-38, 745 A.2d 1074 (2000) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>Appellant also overlooks that in <em>Eastern I </em>the Court remanded, in part, because it determined that the Board\u2019s factual findings were inadequate. In remanding to the Board, however, we did not restrict the Board\u2019s review to the preexisting record. The Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-4\">The Board\u2019s findings of fact must be meaningful and cannot be simply broad conclusionary statements. The rationale behind this principle lies in the \u201cfundamental right of a party to a proceeding before an administrative agency to be apprised of the facts relied upon by the agency in reaching its decision and to permit meaningful judicial review of those findings.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b328-5\"><em>Eastern I, </em>128 Md.App. at 530, 739 A.2d 854 (quoting <em>Bucktail LLC v. County Council of Talbot County, </em>352 Md. 530, 553, 723 A.2d 440 (1999)). Then, in our mandate, we said, in part, at 128 Md.App. at 532, 739 A.2d 854:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-6\">CASE REMANDED TO [THE CIRCUIT] COURT WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO REVERSE THE DECISION OF THE BOARD OF MUNICIPAL AND ZONING APPEALS OF BALTIMORE CITY AND TO REMAND THE CASE TO THE BOARD FOR FURTHER CONSIDERATION OF THE RECORD NOT INCONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">In <em>Harrison v. Harrison, </em>109 Md.App. 652, 675 A.2d 1003 (1996), Judge Cathell explained for this Court the procedures that apply with respect to a mandate:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-8\">While the Maryland cases and rules describe generally the importance of the court\u2019s mandate and the procedures to be followed by the trial <em>court </em>\u2014 i.e., \u201cin accordance with the tenor and direction thereof\u2019 \u2014 they have not clearly described exactly what comprises the complete \u201corder\u201d or \u201cjudgment\u201d of the court. As we construe these rules, and the cases discussing them, it is apparent that, in Maryland, the opinion, at the very least, may be an integral part of the appellate court\u2019s order or mandate <em>when that order or mandate -provides for a remand for proceedings consistent with the opinion. </em>Moreover, when it is apparent from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>opinion itself that a simplified \u201corder\u201d or mandate, <em>e.g., </em>\u201cJudgment Reversed,\u201d is ambiguous, <em>then the opinion may be referred to and considered an integral part of that mandate. </em>There may be, as we discuss <em>infra, </em>many types of unitary judgments or mandates, as opposed to multiple, severable parts of judgments, in which such a \u201cJudgment Reversed\u201d order or mandate would not be ambiguous and there would be no need to refer to the opinion. Generally, however, any direction in <em>an order or mandate that proceedings on remand are to be consistent with the opinion would necessarily require the opinion to be considered as an integral part of the judgment. </em>This position is consistent with the law of mandates as stated by most, but not all, of the few foreign jurisdictions that have squarely addressed the issue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b329-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 665-66, 675 A.2d 1003 (emphasis added.) <em>See also McNeil v. State, </em>112 Md.App. 434, 456, 685 A.2d 839 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">It is also noteworthy that, on remand, the new evidence presented to the Board was cumulative in nature. Indeed, Eastern has not identified any portion of the evidence that differed in any significant way from the evidence presented at the first hearing. Therefore, the error, if any, was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">Finally, we are not persuaded by appellant\u2019s argument that the circuit court was mindful of the \u201cpower to limit review to the record\u201d because, in regard to the second petition for judicial review, it remanded the case to the Board with express instructions not to reopen the record for the receipt of additional evidence. That the circuit court decided after two hearings to expressly limit the record to what was already in existence does not affect our view of whether the Board erred in receiving additional evidence on remand following <em>Eastern I.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-9\"><em>Schultz v. Pritts, </em>291 Md. 1, 432 A.2d 1319 (1981), is the seminal case in Maryland concerning conditional uses or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>special exception uses.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> There, the Court of Appeals explained, at 291 Md. at 11, 432 A.2d 1319:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-4\">The special exception use is a part of the comprehensive zoning plan sharing the presumption that, as such, it is in the interest of the general welfare, and therefore, valid. The special exception use is a valid zoning mechanism that delegates to an administrative board a limited authority to allow enumerated uses which the legislature has determined to be permissible <em>absent any fact or circumstance negating the presumption.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">Following a line of cases, we recognized in <em>Eastern I </em>that \u201ca proposed conditional use is prima facie valid____\u201d <em>Eastern I, </em>128 Md.App. at 525, 739 A.2d 854. The presumption in favor of a conditional use derives from the legislative policy determination that such a use is permissible so long as certain conditions are satisfied. <em>Id. </em>On the other hand, if a request for a special exception will create an adverse effect upon the neighboring properties, the request must be denied. <em>See, e.g., Halle Companies, </em>339 Md. at 141, 661 A.2d 682; <em>Board of County Comm\u2019rs. v. Holbrook, </em>314 Md. 210, 217, 550 A.2d 664 (1988); <em>Moseman v. County Council, </em>99 Md.App. 258, 264, 636 A.2d 499, <em>cert. denied, </em>335 Md. 229, 643 A.2d 383 (1994); <em>Sharp v. Howard County Bd. of Appeals, </em>98 Md.App. 57, 86, 632 A.2d 248 (1993). Therefore, in determining whether to grant a special exception, the Board must determine whether \u201cthe neighboring properties in the general neighborhood would be adversely affected and whether the use in the particular case is in harmony with the general purpose and intent of the plan.\u201d <em>Schultz, </em>291 Md. at 11, 432 A.2d 1319.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>An applicant has the burden of producing evidence to show that the proposed special exception use would not be a detriment to the neighborhood or otherwise adversely impact the public interest. <em>Schultz, </em>291 Md. at 11, 432 A.2d 1319. As the Court explained in <em>Schultz,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"av-dedup-0\">if there is no probative evidence of harm or disturbance in light of the nature of the zone involved or of the factors causing disharmony to the operation of the comprehensive plan a denial of an application for a special exception is arbitrary, capricious, and illegal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b331-4\"><em>Id. </em>If the evidence makes the issue of harm or disturbance fairly debatable, however, the matter is one for the Board\u2019s decision and should not be \u201csecond-guessed\u201d by a reviewing court. <em>Holbrook, </em>314 Md. at 218, 550 A.2d 664.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">In considering the issue of \u201cadverse impact,\u201d the question of harm or disturbance to neighboring properties is critical. A request for a special exception will fail if the adverse effect from the proposed use would be \u201c \u2018above and beyond those inherently associated with such a special exception use irrespective of its location within the zone.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mossburg v. Montgomery County, </em>107 Md.App. 1, 9, 666 A.2d 1253 (1995) (citation omitted); <em>see Schultz, </em>291 Md. at 15, 22, 432 A.2d 1319; <em>Moseman, </em>99 Md.App. at 264, 636 A.2d 499. An adverse impact is established</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-6\">where the facts and circumstances indicate that the particular special exception use and location proposed would cause an <em>adverse effect wpon adjoining and surrounding properties unique and different, in kind or degree, than that inherently associated with such a use regardless of its location within the zone. ...</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b331-7\"><em>Holbrook, </em>314 Md. at 217-218, 550 A.2d 664 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\"><em>Holbrook, </em>314 Md. 210, 550 A.2d 664, is instructive. There, the Court considered the deleterious impact of a mobile home on the value of adjacent properties in the \u201cneighborhood.\u201d For purposes of the adverse impact analysis, the Court defined the concept of neighborhood as \u201c \u2018an area which reasonably constitutes the immediate environs of the subject proper<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>ty.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 219, 550 A.2d 664 (citation omitted). Based on the topography and the number of trees surrounding the proposed location, the Court recognized that the mobile home would be highly visible. Therefore, it determined that \u201cthe Board reasonably concluded that the permanent presence of [a] mobile home would create significantly greater adverse effects in [the particular] location than were it located elsewhere in the zone.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 220, 550 A.2d 664. <em>See also People\u2019s Counsel v.

Vernon area, the City Council made a legislative determination that the use is \u201ccompatible with the permitted uses\u201d in that district, so long as the \u201cbeneficial purposes\u201d are not \u201coutweigh[ed][by] their possible adverse effect\u201d. <em>Schultz, </em>291 Md. at 21, 432 A.2d 1319. It is not our function to change that legislative determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">We also observe that the Court concluded in <em>Eastern I </em>that \u201cthe Board made no factual findings and offered no valid legal conclusions with regard to the denial of the application____ The mere invocation of <em>Schultz\u2019s </em>name cannot immunize the Board\u2019s decision from reversal.\u201d <em>Id., </em>128 Md.App. at 527, 739 A.2d 854. To illustrate that point, the Court noted, <em>inter alia, </em>the absence of \u201cany factual finding peculiar to Eastern\u2019s proposed sign and the surrounding environs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Further, the Court pointed to the lack of findings that the billboard \u201cwould have specific adverse effects ... in its proposed location above and beyond those inherent to such a sign as would obtain generally.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 527-28, 739 A.2d 854.

The circuit court carefully analyzed each of the Board\u2019s purported findings to determine whether the finding constituted a factual finding or a mere conclusion. In most instances, it decided that the statements lacked an adequate factual basis to support them and were merely conclusory. For illustration, we set forth below relevant portions of the circuit court\u2019s opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AJU\">Finding 1. \u201cfinds that ... the billboard ... would be detrimental to the general welfare of the residents and business .of the Mount Vernon community\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-14\">This is a conclusion, not a finding of fact. It may or may not be supported by facts in the record. There is no way that this Court can determine, based on this statement, the basis of the conclusion that the billboard \u201cwould be detrimental.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>Finding 2. Finds it \u201cwould be contrary to the public interest\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-4\">This is also not a finding of fact but a conclusion which suffers from the same problem as Finding 1.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-5\">Finding 3. \u201cFinds that the proposed location is in a uniquely historic setting near Mount Vernon Square\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-6\">This is arguably a finding of fact, instead of a conclusion, although the Board fails to point to anything in the record that supports it. More importantly however, standing alone, this \u201cfinding\u201d does not establish that the billboard would or would not \u201chave any adverse effects above and beyond those inherently associated\u201d with a billboard.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-7\">Finding 4. Finds the proposed location of the billboard is in is \u201cone of the most important and historic settings in the City of Baltimore\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-8\">This suffers from the same problem as Finding 3.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-9\">Finding 5. \u201cconcludes, after consideration of all of the criteria specified in law and based on the size of the proposed billboard, the nature of the surrounding area, the proximity of historic residences and public spaces, the value of preservation of cultural and historic landmarks, and the provisions of the applicable Urban Renewal Plan, that a conditional use for the proposed billboard should not be granted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-10\">This is a conclusion, not a finding of fact. There is nothing in the Board\u2019s decision to let this Court know how the Board arrived at its decision. What is it about the \u201csize of the proposed billboard\u201d that presents a problem? What is the \u201cthe nature of the surrounding area,\u201d and in what ways, if any, will it be effected? [sic] What is \u201cthe proximity of [the billboard] to historic residences\u201d? What impact, if any, will the billboard have on \u201cpublic spaces,\u201d and what are the \u201cpublic spaces\u201d to which the Board is referring? And as to each of these, what evidence in the record supports the finding?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-11\">Finding 6. \u201cgave credit to the evidence submitted by the Baltimore City Department of Planning and Commission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>for Historical and Architectural Preservation (CHAP), both of which concluded that the proposed billboard would be inappropriate at the particular location here at issue.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ARr\">Assuming that \u201cgave credit to\u201d means that the Board was making a finding, this simply states that the Board accepted the <em>conclusion </em>of CHAP that the billboard would be inappropriate. CHAP\u2019s conclusion is not a fact. Although this was an administrative hearing, there needs to be some indicia that the evidence is reliable. <em>Travers v. Baltimore Police Department, </em>115 Md.App. 395, 413, 693 A.2d 378 (1997). If there are facts in the CHAP\u2019s report that support this conclusion and the Board is relying on them, what are they? <em>Cfi </em>Rule 5-702(3) (Expert testimony must have \u201ca sufficient factual basis.\u201d).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-5\">Finding 7. Gave credit to \u201cFor example: Ms. Kathleen G. Kotarba, Executive Director of (CHAP), stated in a letter submitted to the BMZA as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-6\">a. \u201cMount Vernon place is a unique American square that is distinguished in shape and design from any other urban place in the country....\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">See Comments on Finding 3.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-8\">a. \u201cThe <em>proposed signboard will obscure vistas of the monuments </em>and <em>architecture </em>of Mount Vernon\u201d (emphasis added)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-9\">This is a finding of fact, and if supported by evidence would be sufficient to support the Board\u2019s decision. For the reasons discussed below, the statement of Ms. Kotarba is not a sufficient basis to support this statement.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-10\">b. \u201cIt would disrupt [the] view of the historic fabric of the neighborhood\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-11\">This is a conclusion. It is impossible for a reviewing court to determine what view will be disrupted and what is unique to this neighborhood about the alleged disruption. See Comments to Findings 1, 3 and 5.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>c. It would \u201cdiscourage appreciation of [the neighborhood\u2019s] history and culture\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">This is another conclusion. There is nothing in this finding that a reviewing court could review to determine if there is a factual basis for the statement. It is an opinion of Ms. Kotarba that may or may not be correct but there is no way of determining, based on the Board\u2019s decision, if it is factual. See Comments to Findings 1, 3 and 5.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-5\">d. \u201cThe proposed signboard is out of keeping with the character of the area due to its size, scale and shape which is unlike that of the historic surroundings\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">This is a conclusion. A factual'finding would require a finding on the size, scale and shape, not only of the billboard, but on the surrounding area. If the Board had found that the other historic surroundings were x size, scale and shape and this billboard was x plus y size, scale and shape and therefore concluded that the billboard was completely out of character and pointed to evidence in the record to support the finding, it might have formed a basis to uphold the Board\u2019s decision. See Comments to Findings 1, 3 and 5.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-7\">e. \u201cconcerned that future economic development of Mount Vernon as a Cultural District may be impeded by the distraction created by a structure that is obviously out of character\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">This is speculation. There is no explanation of any factual basis for \u201cconcern,\u201d thus leaving the reviewing court to speculate on whether the concern is factually based. Further a finding that the billboard \u201cmay\u201d impede future economic development is meaningless unless there is a factual basis for a reviewing court to determine if there [sic] a realistic probability that it will occur.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-9\">Finding 8. Board credits letter or report that \u201cdiscussed the unique nature of the site and the negative impact the billboard would have on the neighborhood\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b340-12\">This is a conclusion. There is no explanation of what the negative impact has been found to be. Many people are of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>the opinion that a billboard in any neighborhood would have a negative impact. See Comments to Findings 1, 3 and 5.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-4\">Finding 9. \u201cfound persuasive the letters and testimony from individuals and community organizations from the local community who confirmed the unique historic nature of the neighborhood\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">Assuming that \u201cfound persuasive\u201d is a finding, see Comment to Finding 3.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-6\">Finding 10. Found persuasive \u201cthe unique negative impact that a billboard would have been [sic] on the aesthetic, residential, and economic enjoyment of the neighborhood\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">This is a conclusion. There is nothing in this statement that tells the reviewing court what the \u201cunique negative impact\u201d will be. As with Finding 8, a billboard in any neighborhood, many would say, will have a negative impact on the \u201caesthetic, residential and economic enjoyment\u201d of the neighborhood. See Comments to Findings 1, 3 and 5.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-8\">Finding 11. \u201cfinding that the site is in a unique historic location and that the billboard would be detrimental to the neighborhood\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-9\">This is a variation of finding number 8 with the same problem discussed in Findings 1, 3 and 8. There is nothing to inform this Court of why it would be detrimental, and if it is, in what way it would be different from any other neighborhood.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-10\">As stated earlier, finding 7 b that \u201c[t]he proposed signboard will obscure vistas of the monuments and architecture of Mount Vernon,\u201d would be sufficient standing alone to support the Board\u2019s decision if supported by evidence in the record. For the reasons stated below, this Court agrees with petitioner that this statement, as it stands in the Board\u2019s decision, is a bald assertion. The Board does not direct the Court to any specific evidence that the sign would obscure anything.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-4\">Ms. Kotarba\u2019s statement that \u201c[t]he proposed signboard will obscure vistas of the monuments and architecture of Mount Vernon\u201d ... is the only evidence that the Board points to in order to support its finding that the sign will obscure vistas of monuments and architecture. This is not to suggest that Ms. Kotarba could not have given a detailed statement that was reliable, credible, or competent, but such a statement would include the source of her information, whether acquired by personal knowledge or another reliable source, and include information on the height of the monuments and architecture in relationship to the height of the billboard, information on their placement in relationship to each other,- as well as information on what parts or portions of the monuments and architecture would be obscured.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">It is well established that the existence of specific factual findings is a prerequisite for appellate review of a decision of any administrative body. In <em>Mortimer v. Howard Research, supra, </em>83 Md.App. at 442, 575 A.2d 750, the Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-6\">A reviewing court may' not ... uphold an agency\u2019s decision <em>if a record of the facts on which the agency acted or a statement of reasons for its action is lacking. </em>Without this reasoned analysis, a reviewing court cannot determine the basis of the agency\u2019s action. If the agency fails to meet this requirement, the agency\u2019s decision may be deemed arbitrary. <em>In such an instance, the case should be remanded for the purpose of having the deficiency supplied.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-8\">The Board\u2019s findings must be precise and clear enough to facilitate meaningful judicial review. <em>See </em>Lee Modjeska, Administrative Law Practice and Procedure \u00a7 5.6 at 162 (1982 &amp; Supp.1994). This policy ensures reasoned decisions by the agency and permits meaningful judicial review of those decisions. <em>See </em>2 <em>AmJur. </em>2d Administrative Law \u00a7 388, at 388; <em>see also Harford County v. Earl E. Preston, Jr., Inc., </em>322 Md. at 493, 505, 588 A.2d 772 (1991). \u201cIn order to apply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>the appropriate standard of review ... the reviewing court first must know how and why the agency reached its decision. It must know what it is reviewing.\u201d <em>Forman v. Motor Vehicle Admin., </em>332 Md. 201, 220, 630 A.2d 753 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">Of significance here, it is well settled that \u201cgeneral conclusions phrased in the language of the regulatory statute are insufficient.\u201d Modjeska, Administrative Law Practice and Procedure \u00a7 5.6, at 162. In other words, an agency\u2019s findings of fact \u201ccannot simply repeat statutory criteria, broad conclusory statements or boilerplate resolutions.\u201d <em>Bucktail, L.L.C. v. Talbot County, </em>352 Md. 530, 553, 723 A.2d 440 (1999). To the contrary, parties to an administrative hearing have a fundamental right to be apprised of the facts relied upon by the agency in reaching its decision. <em>Annapolis Market Place, L.L.C. v. Parker, </em>369 Md. 689, 717-18, 802 A.2d 1029 (2002); <em>Bucktail, </em>352 Md. at 553, 723 A.2d 440; <em>Preston, </em>322 Md. at 505, 588 A.2d 772; <em>Gough v. Board of Zoning Appeals, </em>21 Md.App. 697, 703, 321 A.2d 315 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">The Court of Appeals has recognized that \u201c[t]he line between \u201cfact\u201d and \u201copinion\u201d is often difficult to draw.\u201d <em>Ellsworth v. Sheme Lingerie, Inc., </em>303 Md. 581, 609, 495 A.2d 348 (1985). The <em>Ellsworth </em>Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-6\">An investigating body may hear diametrically opposed testimony on the question of whether one person or another struck the first blow, and proceed to decide the issue as a finding of \u201cfact.\u201d That determination necessarily has a judgmental quality, and differs, for example, from a finding of fact that a certain number of persons suffered burns from ignition of clothing fabric during a given period. Conclusions found in reports need not be judgmental. A conclusion that there has been a significant increase in fabric-related bum injuries is essentially factual if the data shows a 60% increase. Thus, attaching labels of \u201cfact\u201d or \u201copinion\u201d or \u201cconclusion\u201d will not necessarily resolve the issue, and careful attention must be given to the true nature of the statement and the totality of circumstances bearing on the ultimate issue of reliability.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>This Court, too, has commented on the difference between opinion and fact. In <em>State v. Jones, </em>103 Md.App. 548, 653 A.2d 1040 (1995), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>343 Md. 448, 682 A.2d 248 (1996), Judge Moylan said for the Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-4\">An opinion is a more abstract conclusion of fact than a straight description of something directly observed. Almost everything, however, is at one level or another a matter of opinion. <em>See </em>E. Cleary, McCormick on Evidence 27 (3rd ed. 1984) (\u201cThere is no conceivable statement, however specific, detailed and \u2018factual,\u2019 that is not in some measure the product of inference and reflection as well as observation and memory*1'); R. Lempert <em>&amp; </em>S. Saltzburg, A Modem Approach to Evidence 449 (2d ed. 1982) (\u201cA factual finding, unless it is a simple report of something observed, is an opinion as to what more basic facts apply\u201d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-5\">The almost imperceptible progression from \u201cfact\u201d to \u201copinion,\u201d like the analogous progression from less abstract fact finding to more abstract fact finding, has been well described by E. Cleary, McCormick on Evidence 27 (3rd ed.1984):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-6\">The difference between the statement, \u201cHe was driving on the left-hand side of the road\u201d which would be classed as \u201cfact\u201d under the rule, and \u201cHe was driving carelessly\u201d which would be called \u201copinion,\u201d is merely a difference between a more concrete and specific form of descriptive statement and a less specific and concrete form. The difference between so-called \u201cfact,\u201d then, and \u201copinion,\u201d is not a difference between opposites or contrasting absolutes, but a mere difference in degree with no recognizable line to mark the boundary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-7\">Mark McCormick, Opinion Evidence in Iowa, 19 Drake L.Rev. 245, 247 (1970), commented on the same imperceptible slide along an unbroken continuum:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-8\">[W]hat comes through the senses makes an impression on the mind. This is perception. However, voicing that perception necessarily assumes a process of reasoning. What are recited as facts are some aspects of reality grasped by imperfect senses and filtered through imper-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>feet intellects.... What is fact and what is inference is necessarily a matter of degree and there are no sharp lines of distinction, (footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-4\">The rule against opinions is best understood as a rule of preference which favors the concrete over the abstract. Like the hearsay and original documents rules, it is a \u201cbest evidence\u201d rule. It assumes that testimony which is limited to recital of facts from the actual observation of the witness is generally more reliable than ... testimonial inferences, conclusions and opinions, (footnotes omitted).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-5\">Before getting to such conclusory findings of fact as that the confession was involuntary or the movie was obscene, the fact finder may have to ascend through a dozen levels of escalating abstraction. The higher the level of abstraction, the more the fact finding approaches the status of being conclusory.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-6\"><em>Jones, </em>103 Md.App. at 581-83, 653 A.2d 1040.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">In <em>Annapolis Mkt.

At the hearing before the Anne Arundel County Board of Appeals, appellant \u201cpresented evidence regarding water supply systems, on-site storm drainage systems, sewerage systems, and roads. It did not present any direct evidence regarding fire suppression facilities, off-site storm drainage systems, or schools.\u201d <em>Id., </em>369 Md. at 699, 802 A.2d 1029. Nevertheless, the Board concluded \u201cthat the Petitioner had presented sufficient evidence to meet the standards for the requested rezoning.\u201d 369 Md. at 699, 802 A.2d 1029. The Circuit Court reversed. It concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>\u201c[T]he Board ... was incorrect in finding that the adequate facilities ordinance was complied with\u201d because \u201cno storm water management plan was ever presented to the Board\u201d and \u201cno showing was made that the schools in the area were adequate under a C[ ]3[-]zoning classification.\u201d In addition, the Circuit Court also held that a developer\u2019s \u201cpromises to make [traffic] improvements\u201d did not satisfy the requirement of being either \u201cin existence or programmed for construction.\u201d According to the Circuit Court, Petitioner\u2019s argument that \u201ca promise of [adequate] facilities\u201d is sufficient under \u00a7 2-105(a)(3) \u201cflies in the face of\u2019 the statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"amc-dedup-0\"><em>Id., </em>369 Md. at 701-02, 802 A.2d 1029. Both this Court and the Court of Appeals affirmed. In the Court of Appeals, the developer argued that under \u00a7 2-105(a)(3) the Board could consider evidence of future improvements to existing facilities that the developer agreed to undertake. The Court of Appeals disagreed. With regard to publicly owned off-site facilities, the developer had to prove that adequate facilities were either in existence or programmed for construction. In determining that the Board\u2019s finding that the developer met its burden was not supported by the evidence, the Court stated, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-4\">In recognition of \u201c \u2018the fundamental right of a party to be apprised of the facts relied upon by [an administrative] agency,\u2019 \u201d <em>Bucktail, L.L.C. v. Talbot County, </em>352 Md. 530, 554, 723 A.2d 440, 451 (1999) (quoting <em>Baker v. Bd. of Trustees, </em>269 Md. 740, 747, 309 A.2d 768, 772 (1973)), our review of the Board\u2019s findings and conclusions also takes into consideration the principle that findings of fact by an administrative agency \u201cmust be meaningful and cannot simply repeat statutory criteria, broad conclusory statements, or boilerplate resolutions.\u201d <em>Bucktail, </em>352 Md. at 553, 723 A.2d at 451 (citing <em>Turner v. Hammond, </em>270 Md. 41, 55-56, 310 A.2d 543, 551 (1973)); <em>Rodriguez v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>79 Md.App. 537, 550, 558 A.2d 742, 748 (1989) (\u201cIt is not permissible for the Council, or any administrative body, simply to parrot general statutory requirements or rest on broad conclusory statements.\u201d); <em>Ocean Hideaway Condo</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number><em>minium Ass\u2019n v. Boardwalk Plaza Venture, </em>68 Md.App. 650, 662, 515 A.2d 485, 490-91 (1986). <em>See also Aaron v. City of Balt., </em>207 Md. 401, 406, 114 A.2d 639, 640 (1955)(\u201cIt is arbitrary and unlawful for [an administrative agency] to make an essential finding without supporting evidence.\u201d). In this case, it appears that the Board simply adopted, as positive fact, the negative declaration of a County employee, Mr. Kevin Dooley, that \u201cthere were no issues related to the adequacy of public facilities except for transportation systems.\u201d Therefore, although the Board found \u201cpersuasive\u201d the testimony of Petitioner\u2019s expert engineer that \u201cthe water, sewerage and storm drainage systems\u201d would \u201cbe adequate to serve the uses permitted within the C3 zone,\u201d the Board erred in rendering no affirmative findings regarding the question (or in failing to explain the irrelevancy of such an inquiry on the facts before it) whether adequate off-site water, sewerage, and storm drainage systems were either in existence or programmed for construction in the County\u2019s capital improvements plan.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b347-4\"><em>Annapolis Mkt. Place, </em>369 Md. at 718-19, 802 A.2d 1029.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\"><em>Ocean Hideaway Condominium Ass\u2019n. v. Boardwalk, </em>68 Md.App. 650, 515 A.2d 485 (1986), is also instructive. There, the Board granted a special exception for construction of a building near a public beach. In reaching its determination, the Board addressed the requisite standards, but it did not render a factual finding as to each of them. The Court, in words that are apt here, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-6\">[T]he Board states its conclusions under each of the nine categories without any factual findings whatsoever. <em>Each of the one sentence conclusions contains nothing more than a positive statement of each of the conditions precedent to the approval by the Board of the special exception. </em>.... <em>The citizens of Ocean City are entitled to more than the perfunctory disposition which the Board made of this important zoning case.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b347-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 659-60, 515 A.2d 485 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">The case of <em>Turner v. Hammond, </em>270 Md. 41, 310 A.2d 543 (1973), also provides guidance. There, the Court expressed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>disapproval of the Board\u2019s use of a preprinted form when it wrote the reasons for denying an application. The Court said that \u201cthe \u2018reasons\u2019 given by the Board for denying the application suggest a rather cavalier attitude in respect of its duties and responsibilities. It made no findings of fact worthy of the name and we think citizens are entitled to something more than a boiler plate resolution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 55-56, 310 A.2d 543; <em>accord Cox v. Prince George\u2019s Co., </em>86 Md.App. 179, 186, 586 A.2d 43 (1991); see <em>also </em>Robert M. Anderson, <em>American Law of Zoning </em>\u00a7 16.41, at 242 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">To be sure, there is no litmus test regarding how the Board must phrase its factual findings, reasons, or conclusions. In the absence of adequate findings of fact and expressed i*easons for an agency\u2019s ruling, however, we cannot engage in meaningful review of the Board\u2019s decision. Moreover, we may not manufacture factual findings to cure deficiencies in the Board\u2019s ruling; it is quintessentially the function of the agency to make adequate findings of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">We agree with the circuit court, which made a careful review of the Board\u2019s decision and concluded that the Board did not make adequate factual findings in the case <em>sub judice. </em>Indeed, most of the so called \u201cfindings\u201d of the Board were conclusory. Although the Board related its perceptions, it failed to convey its reasoning process or the facts and data that it used to come to its conclusions. Nor did the Board reveal why the erection of the billboard would have an adverse impact in the neighborhood, above and beyond the adverse effect, that billboards generally create. Therefore, the Board failed to rectify this Court\u2019s concern in <em>Eastern I, </em>in which we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-6\">Nowhere in its decision did the Board make any findings of fact regarding the billboard\u2019s adverse impact on \u201cresidences, churches and historical and preservation uses in the area\u201d or that the sign would be hazardous to motorists using the interstate highway.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-7\"><em>Eastern I, </em>128 Md.App. at 517, 739 A.2d 854.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">What the Court said in <em>Mayor of Baltimore v. Foster &amp; Kleiser, </em>46 Md.App. 163, 171, 416 A.2d 762 (1980), rings true <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>today. We do not \u201cignore or belittle the concerns of those [who oppose] the proliferation of billboards that, to them, are unsightly. But the Court is not the policy-making arm of the City Government; its function is to interpret and apply the law correctly and to make certain that the other instruments of government do likewise.\u201d Accordingly, we conclude that a remand to the Board is appropriate so that, on the basis of the existing record, the BMZA may make specific factual findings to support its conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY AFFIRMED.
