Following the hearing, Magistrate Joseph L. Chylinski opined that plaintiff had proved the occurrence of a compensable injury. Wilson Welding appealed to the Worker\u2019s Compensation Appellate Commission (wcac), which found that the magistrate\u2019s opinion was \u201cvirtually silent as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>to the reasoning supporting its finding of disability.\u201d The WCAC vacated the magistrate\u2019s decision in its entirety, and remanded the matter to the Board of Magistrates so that a different magistrate could prepare a new decision. Plaintiff then filed in the Court of Appeals a complaint for superintending control, which the Court of Appeals dismissed on June 22, 1994 (Docket No. 174536). The Michigan Supreme Court then remanded the case to this Court for a full hearing, pursuant to MCR 7.206(D)(3). <em>Gretel v Worker\u2019s Compensation Appellate </em>Comm, 448 Mich 860 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">In his complaint for superintending control, plaintiff contends that the WCAC was without authority to issue an order vacating the decision of the magistrate and that the WCAC lacked the power to remand to the Board of Magistrates for a new hearing before a new magistrate. We agree, grant superintending control, and reverse the wcac\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">In finding that plaintiff had sufficiently demonstrated the occurrence of a compensable injury, Magistrate Chylinski relied on testimony by plaintiff\u2019s treating physicians. The magistrate\u2019s opinion stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-7\">The testimony of the treating and examining physicians evidenced essentially negative objective findings with the exception of muscle spasms found by plaintiff\u2019s treating physicians. Dr. Marrella testified that plaintiff\u2019s complaints were generally \u201cvery non-specific\u201d and did not follow any dermatome pattern. He felt, however, that the muscle spasms were a sufficient basis upon which to continue treatment. He also testified that during the course of treatment on August 13, 1990, plaintiff was given a muscle relaxant which could well have accounted for Dr. Brown\u2019s failure to find any spasms during his examination of August 14, 1990.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b670-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>On appeal, the wcac found that \u201cthe magistrate\u2019s recitation of plaintiff\u2019s treating physician\u2019s opinion that continuing treatment is needed is insufficient to support a finding of disability.\u201d The wcac further found the magistrate\u2019s decision \u201cinsufficient for purposes of review.\u201d The wcac issued an order vacating the magistrate\u2019s decision and remanding the case \u201cto the Chief Magistrate for assignment to a new magistrate for preparation of a new decision.\u201d We find that the wcac did not have the authority to vacate the magistrate\u2019s decision, nor did it have the power to remand for a new determination. Accordingly, we grant plaintiff\u2019s writ for superintending control and reverse the order of the wcac.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">The WCAC \u201cis an independent body with the power and authority to review the orders of the director and hearing referees and the orders and opinions of the worker\u2019s compensation magistrates as provided for under this act.\u201d MCL 418.274(7); MSA 17.237(274)(7). Although there is no express statutory authority allowing the wcac to vacate a magistrate\u2019s decision or to order that a new decision be prepared by a new magistrate, the wcac contends that it had the implied authority to vacate the magistrate\u2019s decision. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">Administrative bodies such as the wcac are inherently limited in their powers by the express language of the statute. <em>Traverse Oil Co v Chairman, Natural Resources Comm, </em>153 Mich App 679, 686; 396 NW2d 498 (1986). However, administrative authority can also extend beyond that expressly granted to that which is necessarily implied. <em>Id. </em>In this case, the power to remand a case to a new magistrate for a new determination is not inherent in the statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>mandates to the WCAC, nor is the power necessarily implied. The wcac is charged with conducting a \u201cqualitative and quantitative analysis of the evidence and ensur[ing] a full, thorough, and fair review thereof.\u201d MCL 418.861a(13); MSA 17.237(861a)(13). In cases where a magistrate\u2019s findings are not supported by competent, material, and substantial evidence on the whole record, the WCAC has been given the express power to reverse the magistrate\u2019s decision and to substitute its own opinion and order. MCL 418.861a(3); MSA 17.237(861a)(3); <em>Holden v Ford Motor Co, </em>439 Mich 257, 267-268; 484 NW2d 227 (1992). In addition, MCL 418.861a(12); MSA 17.237(861a)(12) grants the wcac the express authority to remand to the magistrate \u201cfor purposes of supplying a complete record if it is determined that the record is insufficient for purposes of review.\u201d Thus, if the wcac feels a magistrate\u2019s decision was not supported by competent, material, and substantial evidence on the record, it can reverse the decision and issue its own opinion. If the WCAC does not believe it has enough information to properly review the magistrate\u2019s decision, it may remand for completion of the record. These powers enable the wcac to folly discharge its duties under the statute; thus, there is no need for the WCAC to have the power to vacate and remand for a new determination. Because the WCAC has been given sufficient authority to fully carry out its duties, no further powers should be implied. <em>Traverse Oil, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">The current system for appeals of decisions of a magistrate was designed to give very limited power to the WCAC, and the decisions of the magistrates are to be final in most cases. <em>Civil Service Comm v Dep\u2019t of Labor, </em>424 Mich 571, 621; 384 NW2d 728 (1986). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>Defendants contend that, if the WCAC does not have the power to remand, the commission will be \u201cforced to become the factfinder of first resort\u201d in cases in which the factfinding of the magistrate was insufficient. We disagree. As set forth above, MCL 418.861a(12); MSA 17.237(861a)(12) grants the WCAC the express authority to remand to the magistrate for a completion of the record. The statute also states that the order and opinion of a worker\u2019s compensation magistrate \u201cshall be part of the record of the hearing.\u201d MCL 418.847(2); MSA 17.237(847)(2). Thus, the WCAC is permitted to remand a case for <em>completion </em>of a magistrate\u2019s opinion and order, including a more thorough recitation of the findings of fact. However, the WCAC has not been given express or implied authority to <em>vacate </em>an order of a magistrate, nor does the WCAC have the power to order that a <em>new </em>hearing be conducted before a <em>new </em>magistrate.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">Because the WCAC exceeded its authority, the proper remedy is to grant plaintiff\u2019s writ for superintending control. <em>In re Loose, </em>201 Mich App 361, 365; 505 NW2d 922 (1993). Accordingly, we reverse the wcac\u2019s order that vacated the magistrate\u2019s decision and ordered a new hearing, and we remand the case to the WCAC. Upon remand, the WCAC is to conduct a review of the magistrate\u2019s decision to determine whether it was supported by competent, material, and substantial evidence on the entire record. If the WCAC determines that the record is insufficient to properly review the magistrate\u2019s decision, the WCAC may remand to the magistrate for the purpose of completing the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">Pursuant to MCL 418.862(1); MSA 17.237(862)(1), plaintiff was to be paid seventy percent of his award <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>of benefits \u201cuntil final determination of the appeal.\u201d However, the Supreme Court has stated, \u201cIf the hearing referee\u2019s award ... is vacated at any appellate stage, the seventy percent benefits are terminated.\u201d <em>McAvoy v H B Sherman Co, </em>401 Mich 419, 444; 258 NW2d 414 (1977). Thus, pursuant to <em>McAvoy, </em>payments to plaintiff were terminated following the WCAC order vacating the magistrate\u2019s award. The <em>McAvoy </em>Court further stated that \u201cif a hearing referee\u2019s award which was vacated or modified at a lower appellate level is reinstated at a higher appellate level, the 70% benefits resume.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 445. Accordingly, we order that payment of plaintiffs seventy percent benefits be reinstated. Plaintiff, however, is not entitled to be paid the seventy percent benefits that were not paid during the period between appeals. <em>Id. </em>at 445, n 6. According to <em>McAvoy, </em>such \u201cback\u201d benefits \u201ccan always be obtained by a successful claimant once the appellate process is completed and all accrued benefits are paid.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">Superintending control granted. The order of the WCAC is reversed and the matter is remanded to the WCAC. Payment of seventy percent of plaintiffs benefits is to be resumed. We do not retain jurisdiction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
