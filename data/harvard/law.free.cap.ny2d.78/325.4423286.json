She was killed while riding in an automobile, owned by her and driven by respondent, when it was involved in an accident with a hit-and-run vehicle. Prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>to the accident, the decedent had purchased an automobile insurance policy from petitioner containing an uninsured motorist endorsement which provided for recovery for bodily injury caused by a hit-and-run vehicle.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">Petitioner seeks to stay the arbitration, contending that respondent\u2019s claim is not compensable under the policy because there was no \"physical contact\u201d between the Killakey vehicle and the unidentified vehicle. Its denial of coverage is premised on evidence that the accident did not occur after contact with another automobile but rather after the tire and rim from an unidentified vehicle struck the windshield of decedent\u2019s car and caused it to crash. The courts below granted the petition and stayed arbitration. They rested their decisions on language found in <em>Matter of Smith (Great Am. Ins. Co.) </em>(29 NY2d 116), which some authorities have interpreted to foreclose coverage under the circumstances presented here. We granted leave to appeal so that we might clarify the <em>Smith </em>holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">Although respondent\u2019s claim is made under the deceased\u2019s automobile insurance policy, the policy\u2019s uninsured motorist endorsement follows the statutory language of Insurance Law \u00a75217 with respect to \"hit-and-run\u201d accidents, and, thus, is subject to the same interpretation <em>(see, Matter of Smith [Great Am. Ins. Co.], </em>29 NY2d 116, 118, <em>supra). </em>Accordingly, our analysis addresses both decisions interpreting section 5217 which applies to New York residents not covered by insurance and decisions involving claims presented by insureds against their insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">The Motor Vehicle Accident Indemnification Corporation Act (Insurance Law art 52) was enacted for the purpose of \"securing to innocent victims of motor vehicle accidents recompense for the injury and financial loss inflicted upon them\u201d (Insurance Law \u00a7 5201 [b]; <em>see also, Matter of Smith [Great Am. Ins. Co.] </em>29 NY2d 116, <em>supra; Motor Vehicle Acc. Indemnification Corp. v Eisenberg, </em>18 NY2d 1). To further this purpose, the act requires insurance protection for persons injured or killed in motor vehicle accidents involving hit-and-run vehicles <em>(see, </em>Insurance Law \u00a7\u00a7 5201, 5217). Such acci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>dents, however, are susceptible to fraud and collusion because they are \"easy to allege and difficult to disprove\u201d <em>(see, MVAIC v Eisenberg, supra, </em>at 4). Thus, to deter the prosecution of fictitious claims, the Legislature imposed a \"physical contact\u201d requirement for all \"hit-and-run\u201d accidents <em>(see, </em>Insurance Law \u00a7 5217 [formerly \u00a7 617]; <em>Matter of Smith [Great Am. Ins. Co.], supra, </em>at 118; <em>MVAIC v Eisenberg, supra, </em>at 4).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">The \"physical contact\u201d language was first interpreted by this Court in <em>MVAIC v Eisenberg (supra), </em>a case in which an unidentified vehicle struck another and propelled it into claimant\u2019s vehicle. We held that the \"contact\u201d required by the statute could be indirect provided there was sufficient evidence to prove that the accident resulted from impact with an unidentified vehicle. The Court returned to the subject in <em>Matter of Smith (supra). </em>In that case, the claimant sought recovery for damages sustained when ice and snow, which he alleged had been disengaged from an unidentified vehicle, struck his automobile and caused an accident. We held that contact with cast-off ice and snow was not sufficient to constitute physical contact and stated that \"the kind of contact required by the statute, even if not direct, must at least originate in collision.\u201d <em>(Matter of Smith [Great Am. Ins. Co.], supra, </em>at 119.) We explained that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-6\">\"physical contact as contemplated by the statute may involve * * * the continued transmission of force indirectly and simultaneously through an intermediate agency, but the initial impact must * * * be that of a collision between the unidentified vehicle with the claimant, the vehicle occupied by him, an obstruction or other object causing the bodily injury.\u201d <em>(Matter of Smith [Great Am. Ins. Co.] supra, </em>at 119.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">Insofar as claimant Smith failed to prove physical contact, as measured by that test, we stayed arbitration <em>(see, Matter of Smith [Great Am. Ins. Co.] supra, </em>at 122).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-9\">Had the decision ended there, the courts might well have dismissed the petition in this case and directed the parties to proceed to arbitration. But the <em>Smith </em>court went on to explain the importance of requiring \"collision\u201d as a prerequisite to a finding of \"physical contact\u201d because collision increased the probability that the offending vehicle was operated negligently and decreased the probability that the claim was fictitious. It noted, however, that, as a result of this requirement, there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>may be instances where negligently caused accidents by hit- and-run vehicles will be excluded from coverage. \"Good examples of such negligently caused accidents, and yet not covered by the statute\u201d, it stated \"would be those caused by objects cast off or falling from a speeding or insecurely laden hit-and-run vehicle itself, <em>such as parts of the vehicle\u201d (Matter of Smith [Great Am. Ins. Co.], supra, </em>at 120 [emphasis added]).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">Understandably, a number of courts have relied upon this language to bar recovery for injuries caused when parts of a vehicle strike the insured or the insured\u2019s, vehicle <em>(see, e.g., Matter of Soto v Motor Vehicle Acc. Indemnification Corp., </em>140 AD2d 223 [pedestrian struck by hubcap dislodged from unidentified vehicle]; <em>Matter of Diaz v Motor Vehicle Acc. Indemnification Corp., </em>82 AD2d 749 [same]; <em>Matter of Utica Mut. Ins. Co. v Spenningsby, </em>133 AD2d 765 [rear relief spring from an unidentified truck struck driver\u2019s windshield, causing him to lose control and collide with another vehicle]). Indeed, in a claim involving facts indistinguishable from those presented today, a sharply divided Appellate Division denied arbitration because the majority believed itself constrained by the dicta in <em>Smith (supra) (see, Government Employees Ins. Co. v Goldschlager, </em>44 AD2d 715). The holding does not require that result, however, and we take this opportunity to clarify the governing rule: \"physical contact\u201d occurs within the meaning of the statute, when the accident originates in collision with an unidentified vehicle, or an integral part of an unidentified vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">That formulation does no violence to the purpose behind the statutory requirement. The remedy for distinguishing between valid and fraudulent hit-and-run claims should rest on the proof that there was, indeed, an unidentified vehicle and that physical contact with the vehicle caused an accident, not on artificial distinctions between accidents involving a vehicle and those which may involve parts which undeniably come from it. The burden of proving a claim when only a part of a vehicle is involved, however, is necessarily substantial; to establish that the claim originated in collision, as <em>Matter of Smith (supra) </em>requires, the claimant must prove that the detached part, in an unbroken chain of events, caused the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">It is clear that the burden was met in the present case. The evidence, though circumstantial, was strong. Five independent witnesses recounted various details to establish that an un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>identified vehicle traveling east on the Long Island Expressway lost a wheel and that the tire and its rim traveled across the median and struck Killakey\u2019s westbound vehicle. Witnesses also heard the assembly of the missing wheel scraping on the pavement, observed the vehicle come to a stop in the eastbound lane to mount the spare, and then disappear before the police arrived without the driver identifying himself. From this evidence, the court below found as a fact that \"[t]he tire that struck Mrs. Killakey came off an unidentified vehicle\u201d and that \"[t]he sole cause of injury and death was the wheel and tire\u201d which had been propelled into her vehicle. In view of these findings, respondent has satisfied the \"physical contact\u201d requirement of the policy, i.e., that the claim \"originated] in collision\u201d with an unidentified vehicle, and arbitration is not foreclosed merely because the tire and the rim had separated from the vehicle moments before, bounded across the median and crashed into decedent\u2019s car.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">Our decision is consistent with the holding in <em>Matter of Smith </em>(29 NY2d 116, <em>supra). </em>Snow and ice from an unidentified vehicle are clearly not integral parts of the vehicle and contact between them and a claimant\u2019s vehicle does not constitute a \"collision\u201d between the two. Manifestly, such occurrences fall outside the scope of today\u2019s ruling <em>(see generally, </em>8C Appleman, Insurance Law and Practice \u00a7 5095.45, at 428; Whitney, <em>Uninsured Motorist Coverage for Hit-and-Run Vehicles: The Requirement of Physical Contact, </em>49 La L Rev 955; Annotation, <em>Hit-and-Run Vehicle </em>\u2014 Physical <em>Contact, </em>25 ALR3d 1299).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be reversed, with costs, and petitioner\u2019s motion to stay arbitration denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">Chief Judge Wachtler and Judges Kaye, Alexander, Ti-tone, Hancock, Jr., and Bellacosa concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">Order reversed, etc.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b397-8\"> The term hit-and-run vehicle is defined in the policy as \"an automobile which caused bodily <em>injury to an insured arising out of physical contact </em>of such automobile with the insured or with an automobile which the insured is occupying at the time of the accident, provided * * * there cannot be ascertained the identity of either the operator or owner of such 'hit-and-run\u2019 automobile.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
