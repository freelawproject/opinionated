The repurchase provision contained in the contract and deed did not create a future interest and was enforceable in a traditional specific performance action. <em>(Pacamor Bearings v British Am. Dev.

We hold that the parties\u2019 intention, reflected in a merged obligation found in the deed of sale, produced a covenant and we therefore modify by denying the defendant\u2019s cross motion for summary judgment and remitting to Supreme Court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>Plaintiff, Suffolk Business Center (SBC), was formed to acquire and develop, as an industrial park, a 302-acre tract of land in Smithtown, Suffolk County. In 1978, SBC contracted to sell an approximately 8.17-acre parcel within the proposed industrial park to defendant, Applied Digital Data Systems, Inc. (Applied) for $408,695. Applied owned an adjoining seven-acre parcel, improved with a building and used to its maximum capacity under the local zoning code. Applied planned to use the combined parcels to expand its facilities under a project denominated the \"Phase I Improvements\u201d. It consisted of a 12,600-square-foot warehouse addition to Applied\u2019s existing building, to be located partially on both parcels, and a 23,250-square-foot office building.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">The contract of sale contained a requirement by which Applied agreed to commence construction on the Phase I improvements within one year after it acquired title and then to continue with due diligence until Phase I was completed. Under the agreement, if Applied failed or fell short in that regard, SBC on written notice was entitled but not obligated to repurchase the subject parcel and Applied was required to sell it back at the original purchase price. One month after entering into the contract, the parties closed on the title, and the deed, reciting the construction/repurchase provision, was recorded. Applied began and substantially completed construction of the warehouse addition. It concedes its failure to commence construction of the office building improvement of Phase I, due apparently to unfavorable economic conditions. Based on that failure, SBC exerted its option to repurchase the subject parcel, as partially improved by Applied. Applied rejected SBC\u2019s overture and this lawsuit ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">SBC sued for specific performance, among other related and alternative forms of relief. On cross motions for summary judgment, Supreme Court, Suffolk County, granted Applied\u2019s cross motion and dismissed the complaint, without prejudice to SBC commencing an action pursuant to RPAPL 1953. The Appellate Division affirmed, agreeing with Supreme Court that SBC had conveyed a fee to Applied, subject to a future interest on a condition subsequent, enforceable only under RPAPL 1953 (162 AD2d 677). This Court granted SBC\u2019s motion for leave to appeal and now modifies the order of the Appellate Division, which is final <em>(see, McDermott v Manhattan Eye, Ear &amp; Throat Hosp., </em>15 NY2d 20, 23, n 2).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">We hold that the words used in the critical documents and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>the omission of any right of reentry effecting a forfeiture manifests the commercially sophisticated parties\u2019 intent to create a covenant running with the land enforceable in equity. Contrary to the holdings of the lower courts, the right at issue in this transaction is not one of reacquisition subject to a condition subsequent, which would relegate the parties solely to the statutory remedy of RPAPL 1953.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">SBC\u2019s rights flow from the deed into which the contractual obligations merged, as the lower courts properly concluded <em>(Schoonmaker v Hoyt, </em>148 NY 425, 429-430; 3 Warren\u2019s Weed, New York Real Property, Merger, \u00a7 3.01; 1A Warren\u2019s Weed, <em>op. cit., </em>Contracts, \u00a7 20.02). The parties had expressly agreed that \"the deed to be delivered by the Seller under this Agreement shall contain such provisions as are necessary <em>to implement </em>the [construction/repurchase] provisions <em>* * * so that such provisions shall constitute covenants running with the land.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) This particularized expression and characterization of their specific intent as to the provision at issue should control and is superior to the boilerplate survival-of-contract-rights-and-obligations clause, found in paragraph 22 of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">This case turns essentially on the proper classification of the construction/repurchase provision: Is it a covenant enforceable in equity or a future estate on a condition subsequent enforceable only under RPAPL 1953? A covenant is a promise to do or refrain from doing certain things with respect to real property (1A Warren\u2019s Weed, <em>op. cit., </em>Conditions and Limitations, \u00a7\u00a7 1.03, 2.01; 1A Warren\u2019s Weed, <em>op. cit., </em>Deeds, \u00a7 14.01; 4A Warren\u2019s Weed, <em>op. cit., </em>Restrictive Covenants, \u00a7\u00a7 1.03, 1.05). A covenant for the construction of improvements on a parcel may be enforceable in an action at law for money damages for breach or where, as here, the covenant runs with the land, in an equitable action for specific performance (1A Warren\u2019s Weed, <em>op. cit., </em>Conditions and Limitations, \u00a7\u00a7 1.03, 2.01), the precise remedy to be fashioned to suit the competing equitable circumstances between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">On the other hand, a right of reacquisition retained by a grantor upon the simultaneous creation of an estate, and triggered by a condition subsequent, is classified as a future estate (EPTL 6-4.6). A future interest on a condition subsequent is one that by failure or nonperformance may operate to forfeit an estate that is otherwise conditionally vested <em>(Munro v Syracuse, Lake Shore &amp; N. R. R. Co., </em>200 NY 224, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>230; <em>Towle v Remsen, </em>70 NY 303, 309, 311-312; 1A Warren\u2019s Weed, <em>op. cit., </em>Conditions and Limitations, \u00a7\u00a7 1.03, 5.01; EPTL 6-1.1, 6-4.6).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">Whether the construction/repurchase provision in this deed qualifies as a covenant of a condition subsequent is dependent upon the parties\u2019 intent. Intent is drawn from the governing instrument itself and from the particular language selected to reflect the goals and understandings of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">While not alone dispositive, the provision in this deed uses the real property word of art, \"covenants,\u201d with respect to the contemplated construction/repurchase option. That helps to pin down the parties\u2019 intent to create a covenant to allow repurchase, not a future interest on the happening of a condition subsequent which may effect a forfeiture <em>(Graves v Deterling, </em>120 NY 447). The ultimate inclusion of the key provision in the deed instrument is likewise not alone dispositive in view of the covenant language used and the absence of the critical term \"condition\u201d. Again, particular words alone are not determinative and no particular words need be used <em>(Munro v Syracuse, Lake Shore &amp; N. R. R. Co., </em>200 NY, at 231, <em>supra; Post v Weil, </em>115 NY 361, 369-372, 374; <em>Towle v Remsen, </em>70 NY 303, <em>supra; </em>1A Warren\u2019s Weed, <em>op. cit., </em>Conditions and Limitations, \u00a7\u00a7 2.01, 2.03). However, terminology is highly significant and launches the analysis because legal terms of art in a conveyance are presumed to have been used with their accustomed meaning, especially where the context and circumstances reveal no contrary direction <em>(Graves v Deterling, </em>120 NY, at 457, <em>supra). None </em>of the traditional future interest language was used anywhere in this deed <em>(Trustees of Union Coll. v City of New York, </em>173 NY 38; 1A Warren\u2019s Weed, <em>op. cit., </em>Conditions and Limitations, \u00a7 3.01). Also supportive of our interpretation is the lack of any language parallelling the statutory language for the creation of future estates <em>(see, </em>EPTL 6-3.2 [a] [1] [C]; 6-4.6).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">Examined from another perspective, we observe that a future interest may be deemed present where a grantor reserves a right to reenter to effectuate a forfeiture upon a grantee\u2019s failure to perform a condition subsequent. While an express reentry reservation is not essential <em>(Post v Weil, </em>115 NY, at 371, <em>supra; </em>1A Warren\u2019s Weed, <em>op. cit., </em>Conditions and Limitations, \u00a7 5.02), it is well established that inclusion of such a right is one of the clearest and strongest manifestations supporting a finding of intent to create a future interest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>on a condition subsequent <em>(Munro v Syracuse, Lake Shore &amp; N. R. R. Co., </em>200 NY, at 231, <em>supra). </em>Conversely, the weight of authority indicates that a covenant is intended and preferred where, as here, the deed is tellingly silent as to any reentry authorization <em>(Cunningham v Parker, </em>146 NY 29, 33; <em>Graves v Deterling, </em>120 NY, at 457, <em>supra; Post v Weil, </em>115 NY, at 371-372, <em>supra; Stillwell v Morley, </em>26 AD2d 740; 2 Powell, Real Property \u00b6 188, at 13-69; 1A Warren\u2019s Weed, <em>op. cit., </em>Conditions and Limitations, \u00a7 2.04; Restatement of Property \u00a7 45, illustration 13, at 144). This deed gives SBC only the discretionary option to repurchase the parcel on notice at the original purchase price as an agreed-upon remedy for Applied\u2019s breach of the construction/repurchase provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">Our conclusion that the deed contains a covenant and not a future estate is fortified by the plain meaning and operation of the deed\u2019s repurchase provision; the provision does not effect a forfeiture, which is usually an essential component of a future interest on a condition subsequent <em>(Trustees of Union Coll. v City of New York, </em>173 NY 38, <em>supra; Upington v Corrigan, </em>151 NY 143, 154; <em>Matter of Nelson, </em>154 AD2d 378). Although enforcement of the repurchase provision could lead to SBC\u2019s reacquiring the subject land with its improvements, SBC\u2019s payment to Applied of the original purchase price \u2014 as required by the deed repurchase provision \u2014 avoids forfeiture as that term of art is usually understood in such matters. The type of estate created should be determined with reference to the time the parties make their agreement and consummate their transaction. The subsequent improvement and appreciation of the land does not retroactively or by itself convert the critical provision into a future estate. These are matters requiring certainty and reliable predictability. Thus, they cannot be left to vary on a case-by-case basis. Indeed, one wonders what the effect and rule would be if the land here had not been improved and had depreciated in value. The case-by-case approach would deny effect to the parties\u2019 agreement and intent and concentrate on extrinsic subsequent events, some of which are not even in the control of the contracting, transacting parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">The legislative history of Real Property Law \u00a7 347, predecessor to RPAPL 1953, also indicates that the purpose of the statute is to limit the enforceability of forfeiture provisions (1958 Report of NY Law Rev Commn, at 227-228, 233, reprinted in 1958 McKinney\u2019s Session Laws of NY, at 1709, 1713; <em>see, 2A </em>Powell, Real Property \u00b6 271 [3], at 20-29 <em>et seq.; </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>1A Warren\u2019s Weed, <em>op. cit., </em>Conditions and Limitations, \u00a7 1.05; <em>Board of Educ. v Miles, </em>15 NY2d 364, 367-368). Enforcement of this covenant does not effect a forfeiture. The Law Revision Commission Report, which proposed the statute as originally adopted, specifically distinguished future interests subject to conditions subsequent, a forfeiture species covered by section 1953, from nonforfeiture covenants such as a right of reconveyance enforceable in equity (1958 McKinney\u2019s Session Laws of NY, at 1709). Parenthetically, an intention to preserve a future interest on a condition subsequent must be periodically refiled, which may shortly extinguish many such future interests through inadvertent failure to file (Real Property Law \u00a7 345; <em>see, </em>2A Powell, Real Property \u00b6 271 [3], at 20-32; <em>Board of Educ. v Miles, </em>15 NY2d 364, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">Finally, therefore, the provision at issue is cogently distinguishable in character and effect from conditions in instruments which provide a right of reentry, which effect a forfeiture, and which use language reflecting a clear intent to create a future interest sufficient to overcome the presumption against conditions subsequent <em>(see, Munro v Syracuse, Lake Shore &amp; N. R. R. Co., </em>200 NY, at 230, <em>supra; Upington v Corrigan, </em>151 NY, at 153-154, <em>supra). </em>We, thus, find more reasonable the conclusion that this repurchase provision, characterized in the deed as a \"covenant\u201d and lacking a reentry authorization or forfeiture effect, was intended by the parties to create a covenant enforceable in equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">Denial of summary judgment to both parties leaves the defendant\u2019s affirmative defenses to be resolved, as they have not been ruled on by any court thus far. We note also that Supreme Court has the broad, discretionary, equitable power to mold the appropriate remedy under all the circumstances pertaining to this dispute within the framework of this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be modified, with costs to plaintiff, by denying defendant\u2019s cross motion for summary judgment and remitting the case to Supreme Court for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion and, as so modified, affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b460-8\">Kaye, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aqt\">(dissenting). The Court is called upon to decide whether the repurchase provision in issue is a condition subsequent or a restrictive covenant, a determination that obviously has significant impact on plaintiff\u2019s remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-9\">If \u2014 as plaintiff grantor, Suffolk Business Center (SBC), argues \u2014 defendant violated a covenant or contract right, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>remedy will be specific performance by reconveyance of property or the monetary equivalent. If, on the other hand, the provision is a condition subsequent, enforcement must take place through the procedural vehicle of RPAPL 1953. Under the statute, defendant\u2019s interest could be divested only on a determination that plaintiff possessed a substantial interest in enforcing its right. Moreover, the statute states that if it appears that the relief provided would be inequitable, Supreme Court may shape an appropriate remedy in order to avoid forfeiture of improved property or other unjust enrichment. A conclusion that a condition subsequent was intended would require dismissal of SBC\u2019s complaint without prejudice to bringing the appropriate RPAPL 1953 proceeding, which in fact has already been commenced by SBC and stayed pending the determination of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">I agree wholeheartedly with the majority\u2019s premises. The parties\u2019 intent is controlling in determining whether they created a restrictive covenant or condition subsequent. Moreover, all contractual obligations of these parties merged into the deed, and the rights of SBC flow only from the deed; thus, we must determine the parties\u2019 intent from the words of the deed and the surrounding circumstances. These premises, however, together with the time-honored proposition that equity abhors a forfeiture, lead me to the opposite conclusion: Supreme Court and the Appellate Division were clearly correct in holding that the parties intended to create a condition subsequent enforceable under RPAPL 1953, not a contract right enforceable in specific performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">With the fundamental premises in mind, a brief review of the facts points to affirmance of the Appellate Division order.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">In 1978, SBC conveyed an eight-acre tract to defendant, Applied Digital Data Systems (ADDS), for $408,000. ADDS already owned an adjacent seven-acre tract which housed its manufacturing, engineering and general office operations. A provision contained in the deed provided that ADDS would construct a warehouse addition to its existing building \u2014 12,600 square feet of which was to be located on the subject premises \u2014and a separate office facility. Construction was to commence within one year of the date of the deed and was to be completed with due diligence. If ADDS failed to perform, SBC was given the option of repurchasing the property at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>original purchase price. According to SBC, the provision served important purposes within the context of the development of its industrial park: to accelerate sales (and thereby increase the price of other property) and to ensure that lots were sold to purchasers who intended to construct substantial improvements, not to mere speculators.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">In 1978 and 1979, ADDS constructed a 35,000-square-foot warehouse addition to its existing facility \u2014 18,500 square feet on the subject premises (50% more than required in the deed). Underground utilities, parking facilities, paving and landscaping work were also completed at that time. These improvements cost ADDS $700,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">Nearly six years later \u2014 on December 21, 1984 \u2014 SBC notified ADDS that it was in breach of the construction obligation for failure to build the office facility, that SBC was therefore exercising its right to repurchase at the original price of $408,000, and scheduling the closing in 30 days. At the time notice was sent by SBC, all marketable parcels in the original 300-acre tract had been sold. In 1985, when SBC tendered the $408,000 to ADDS, SBC\u2019s own expert valued the property at $1.7 million. ADDS valued the property at $3.3 million in June 1988, when the summary judgment motion was submitted to the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">On these facts, the majority now holds that the parties intended to create a restrictive covenant, one that gave SBC the option to repurchase the subject parcel at cost if the specified improvements were not made within the prescribed period. That analysis is flawed, as the ensuing sections demonstrate.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-9\">As the majority acknowledges, in deciding the issue of intent \"particular words alone are not determinative and no particular words need be used\u201d (majority opn, at 388; see, <em>Towle v Remsen, </em>70 NY 303, 311). The Court then concludes that the repurchase provision was intended as a restrictive covenant based on: the absence of traditional future interest language <em>(id., </em>at 388); failure of the parties to explicitly reserve a right to reenter <em>(id., </em>at 388-389); and the conclusion that enforcement of the provision would not effect a forfeiture of defendant\u2019s estate <em>(id., </em>at 389).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-10\">Under the majority\u2019s own standard, the first two grounds for deciding the issue of intent are not determinative. As for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>the third, there can be no question that enforcement of the repurchase provision would have the effect of terminating the defendant\u2019s estate by operation of law, and therefore work a forfeiture of that estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">Turning to the majority\u2019s concern with the absence of particular words from the provision in issue, the reservation of an express right to \"reenter\u201d is not necessary <em>(see, Post v Weil, </em>115 NY 361, 371). That point can have no clearer expression than the 1966 amendments to the EPTL, which replaced the term \"right of reentry\u201d with \"right of reacquisition\u201d (L 1966, ch 952, adding EPTL 6-4.6). The changes in language were made to eliminate \"historical nomenclature which has become obsolete\u201d (Report of Commn in Law of Estates on Estates, Powers and Trusts Law, 1966 McKinney\u2019s Session Laws of NY, at 2936, 2942).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">Rather than emphasizing the absence of \"magic words\u201d in the repurchase provision \u2014 an exercise we all agree is of little value in determining intent \u2014 the analysis should turn on the words used in the context of the parties\u2019 transaction. That these parties intended to create a condition subsequent, rather than a covenant, is evident from the characteristics of the interest created \u2014 a personal right exercisable at the option of the grantor.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">Like a covenant, a condition subsequent runs with the burdened land. But while the benefit of the covenant may also run with the land, the benefit of a condition subsequent is always personal to the grantor <em>(see, Post v Weil, </em>115 NY, at 372-373, <em>supra; </em>1A Warren\u2019s Weed, New York Real Property, Conditions and Limitations, \u00a7\u00a7 1.04, 5.07).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">A personal right to reacquire the property was created in the deed over to ADDS, indicating that a condition subsequent was intended, not a covenant. The parties provided in the deed that the benefits of other restrictions \u2014 prohibiting certain uses of the subject premises, such as for a tavern or banking institution \u2014 were to run with the retained land. The repurchase provision, by contrast, contained no such limitation on the right of enforcement, thereby indicating that the parties intended to create a personal benefit in SBC.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">The nature of the repurchase provision further indicates an intent to create a condition subsequent. Contrary to the majority\u2019s emphasis on SBC\u2019s \"discretionary option\u201d to repurchase the land (majority opn, at 389) as a basis for finding a covenant, the discretionary nature of the right to reacquire <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>the property only serves to support the conclusion that a condition subsequent was intended. Indeed, one of the distinguishing characteristics of a condition subsequent is that the fee estate is terminated <em>\"only at the option of the grantor\u201d </em>(2 Powell, Real Property \u00b6 188 [emphasis in original]; <em>Upington v Corrigan, </em>151 NY 143, 153 [when condition occurred, it became optional with the grantor to have the forfeiture declared]).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">Finally, as strong support for concluding that the provision created a covenant, the majority relies on its conclusion that exercise of the repurchase option would not work a forfeiture of defendant\u2019s estate. The majority claims that repayment of the purchase price avoids a forfeiture as that term of art is usually understood in such matters (majority opn, at 389). The Court cites no authority for a definition of that term, and its conclusion is erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">The Law Revision Commission defined forfeiture as related to \"a restriction on the use of land under which the estate subject to the restriction is terminated by operation of law, either automatically or at the election of the grantor.\u201d (1958 Report of NY Law Rev Commn, at 226, reprinted in 1958 McKinney\u2019s Session Laws of NY, at 1708.) Under the common law, if a condition subsequent were found to exist, the court had no authority to change its terms and would be required to order the conveyance. Emphasis is on the inevitable loss of the estate by operation of law, which often involves a windfall for the grantor <em>(see, e.g., </em>RPAPL 1953 [3] [justice may require that the court \"avoid a forfeiture of the value of improvements or other unjust enrichment\u201d]).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">The majority cites to the report made by the Law Revision Commission in support of the amendments to the Real Property Law made in 1958, for the proposition that repurchase provisions must be characterized as \"nonforfeiture.\u201d Absence of \"forfeiture\u201d leads the majority to conclude that no condition subsequent was intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">Examination of the relevant authority, however, establishes that a forfeiture would result if the repurchase provision were specifically enforced. The case cited by the Law Revision Commission, <em>Teachers Coll. v Goldstein </em>(273 App Div 11, <em>affd </em>297 NY 969), was a cy pres case that did not involve any discussion of a condition subsequent. The Law Revision Commission merely pointed out that such agreements may resemble nonforfeiture restrictions. Obviously, the facts and circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>stances at the time of the creation of the interest must be examined in order to determine forfeiture.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\">That was precisely the course taken by the court in <em>Pacamor Bearings v British Am. Dev. Corp. </em>(108 AD2d 191), where the provision called for the repurchase of the land for $35,000 per acre if a certain facility was not under construction within two years of the transfer. The court was faced with the issue whether the relevant language created a condition subsequent or a covenant running with the land. Citing the need for additional facts to determine the intent of the parties, the court denied summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">It is a clear indication that a condition subsequent was intended when the continued enjoyment of the estate is made dependent upon the performance of a certain stipulation <em>(Munro v Syracuse, Lake Shore &amp; N. R. R. Co., </em>200 NY 224, 230; <em>Craig v Wells, </em>11 NY 315, 320-321). A \"forfeiture\u201d takes place when the condition is violated, enjoyment of the estate is terminated and the property is reclaimed <em>(see, Graves v Deterling, </em>120 NY 447, 457).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">There can be no doubt that defendant\u2019s estate was intended to depend on its fulfillment of the building requirement. As SBC\u2019s counsel and secretary, who participated in the transaction, testified, SBC \"intended only to sell property to purchasers who were going to construct a substantial improvement on the property.\u201d If no construction was undertaken within the stated period, the intention was that the parties would return to their original positions \u2014 as if the conveyance had never occurred. In sum, ADDS would forfeit its right to continued enjoyment of the estate, albeit upon the repayment of the original purchase price.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">Any test other than one that looks to the intent of the parties to have the estate terminate upon failure of the condition or stipulation would require the courts to establish a baseline figure for repurchase agreements. Should the rule be that repayment of the original purchase price \u2014 no matter what the increase in value due to the grantee\u2019s efforts \u2014 always denotes a nonforfeiture restriction? SBC\u2019s only attempt to distinguish <em>Pacamor </em>is based on the fact that the relevant provision there was contained solely in the deed, not in the governing contract. We agree with the majority that only the deed provision survives in the present case, making plaintiffs distinction inapplicable. Rather, the court must look to the facts surrounding the transaction and the effect of enforce<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>ment on the grantee\u2019s estate \u2014 in this case the mandatory reconveyance of improved property for a fraction of its fair market value, or payment of the equivalent in money damages. Such a result, if ordered by the court, would indeed be forfeiture.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">Where the intent of the parties is not plainly manifested, courts will construe words of limitation as covenants in order to avoid the harsh consequences of forfeiture that sometimes result from enforcement of a condition subsequent. That very rule of construction, however, in this case argues for concluding that the language creates a condition subsequent.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">The policy that courts will strive to avoid forfeiture and therefore interpret ambiguous provisions as creating covenants rather than conditions was applied with vigor prior the 1958 revisions to the Real Property Law <em>(see, e.g., Lipton v Bruce, </em>1 NY2d 631, 637; <em>Munro v Syracuse, Lake Shore &amp; N. R. R. Co., </em>200 NY, at 230, <em>supra). </em>That policy must now be reevaluated in light of radical amendments to the statute <em>(see, </em>Glasser, Practice Commentary, McKinney\u2019s Cons Laws of NY, Book 17B, EPTL 6-4.6, at 86 [revisions, including RPAPL 1953, \"radically affect the common law learning on the right of reacquisition\u201d incident to a fee on condition subsequent]).</p>\n<p id=\"AJ2u\">Under the revised RPAPL 1953, one seeking to enforce a right of reentry (now known as a \"right of reacquisition\u201d under EPTL 6-4.6) must bring an action to compel conveyance of the property. The statute further provides that the relief requested \u2014 conveyance\u2014will only be granted upon a showing that plaintiff has a \"substantial interest in enforcement of the restriction.\u201d (RPAPL 1953 [3].) Finally, the statute grants Supreme Court broad equitable power to \"grant alternative relief\u2019 or impose additional conditions \"as justice may require.\u201d (RPAPL 1953 [3].) These broad powers were granted to avoid \"the chief evil of forfeiture restrictions,\u201d namely their immunity to the doctrine of relative hardship and the unavail<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>ability of substitute forms of relief such as money damages <em>(see, </em>1958 Report of NY Law Rev Commn, at 233, reprinted in 1958 McKinney\u2019s Session Laws of NY, at 1713). With the \"chief evil\u201d exorcised, mechanical application of the nonforfeiture policy may actually undermine the goals of the revised statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\">The inapplicability of the policy to the present case is amply demonstrated by the parties\u2019 respective positions. It is the <em>grantee </em>that seeks to have the provision interpreted as a condition subsequent, while the <em>grantor </em>argues that it is a covenant or a contract right. Clearly, SBC seeks to avoid the strictures placed upon the enforcement of the right of reacquisition by RPAPL 1953 \u2014 namely the showing of \"substantial interest\u201d in enforcement. Rather, SBC demands specific performance of the contract right, working the very inequity that section 1953 was intended to alleviate.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">I therefore dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">Judges Alexander, Titone and Hancock, Jr., concur with Judge Bellacosa; Judge Kaye dissents and votes to affirm in a separate opinion in which Chief Judge Wachtler and Judge Simons concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">Order modified, etc.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b466-9\"> Contrary to the majority\u2019s characterization (majority opn, at 389), it is not intended that forfeiture be determined by reference to events occurring subsequent to creation of the interest. Rather, consistent with the analysis of the parties\u2019 intent, it must be determined if defendant\u2019s estate was meant to terminate by operation of law upon nonperformance of the condition. That this might lead to loss of valuable improvements by the one in possession indicates only that the forfeiture would work an inequitable hardship that should be avoided if possible <em>(see, </em>RPAPL 1953 [3]).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
