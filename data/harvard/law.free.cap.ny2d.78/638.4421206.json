Three years after his direct appeal was exhausted, defendant brought a motion to vacate his conviction pursuant to CPL 440.10 based on the People\u2019s failure to supply him with a memorandum that contained the statement of a prosecution witness. The defendant claims that this was <em>Rosario </em>material and, therefore, the People should have turned it over to defendant during the trial <em>(see, People v Rosario, </em>9 NY2d 286, <em>cert denied </em>368 US 866).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-9\">On this appeal, we revisit the cases that grew out of our decision in <em>Rosario, </em>cases in which we stated and refined a per se error rule that called for reversal whenever the prosecution completely failed to turn over <em>Rosario </em>material. In <em>People v </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number><em>Consolazio </em>(40 NY2d 446, 454), we first held that harmless error analysis was inappropriate when a defendant challenged the prosecution\u2019s failure to turn over <em>Rosario </em>material. Since <em>Consolazio, </em>we have articulated the policy reasons for adopting a per se error rule for <em>Rosario </em>violations and have repeatedly reaffirmed our commitment to that rule <em>(see, e.g., People v Jones, </em>70 NY2d 547; <em>People v Ranghelle, </em>69 NY2d 56; <em>People v Perez, </em>65 NY2d 154).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">In each of these cases, however, the defendant\u2019s <em>Rosario </em>claim was the subject of a direct appeal from the judgment of conviction. Even <em>People v Novoa </em>(70 NY2d 490), in which the defendant\u2019s <em>Rosario </em>claim was the subject of both direct appeal and a CPL 440.10 motion, was treated as a direct appeal for procedural purposes. We were not asked to consider at that time whether the per se error rule should be extended to apply to postconviction motions to vacate under CPL 440.10.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">Thus, the question before the Court today is indeed a novel one. We must decide whether the per se error rule applies to <em>Rosario </em>claims raised on a CPL 440.10 motion after a defendant\u2019s direct appeal has been completed. The only two subdivisions of CPL 440.10 that arguably touch upon <em>Rosario </em>violations both require a defendant to show that he was prejudiced by the conduct that is the subject of the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">In originally adopting the per se error rule, we balanced the rights of the defendant against the rights of society and arrived at a policy designed to foster the \"right sense of justice\u201d that had led this Court to fashion and impose the stringent discovery requirements that are at the heart of the <em>Rosario </em>decision. Here, however, the Legislature has already spoken and required defendants filing CPL 440.10 motions to make a showing of prejudice. Given the policy concerns underlying this prejudice requirement, including society\u2019s interest in the finality of judgments, we conclude that prejudice cannot be assumed and must be articulated. Thus, we hold that a defendant who has exhausted direct appeal and who seeks to raise a <em>Rosario </em>claim by way of a CPL 440.10 motion will be required to make an actual showing that prejudice resulted from the prosecution\u2019s failure to turn over <em>Rosario </em>material. Accordingly, we now reverse and remit.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-8\">L_</p>\n<p id=\"b711-9\">A detailed account of the events leading up to the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>dant\u2019s conviction for felony murder and arson is contained in this Court\u2019s opinion disposing of defendant\u2019s direct appeal from his judgment of conviction (65 NY2d 265). Since 1985, the year his conviction was affirmed, defendant has twice moved to have that conviction vacated pursuant to CPL 440.10. The first such motion, based on ineffective assistance of trial and appellate counsel, was denied by the trial court in 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">The motion at issue on this appeal was brought in July of 1988. The defendant again claimed on this motion that the representation provided by his trial attorney had been ineffective, and additionally claimed that he had been deprived of <em>Brady </em>material <em>(Brady v Maryland, </em>373 US 83). The trial court notified the People and defense counsel that it would also treat the defendant\u2019s motion as raising a claim for relief under <em>Rosario. </em>During the hearings on the motion, the People conceded that the defendant had not been given a memorandum that contained a synopsis of an interview with a fire marshal who later testified for the prosecution at trial. The People also acknowledged that the memorandum was not the duplicative equivalent of material that had been turned over to the defendant <em>(see, e.g., People v Consolazio, supra, </em>at 454). In a memorandum decision dated November 7, 1988, the Trial Judge granted defendant\u2019s motion to vacate his judgment of conviction. Citing this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Novoa (supra), </em>the Trial Judge rejected the People\u2019s argument that the defendant needed to show that he had been prejudiced by the <em>Rosario </em>violation. The Appellate Division affirmed the trial court\u2019s order, relying on language from <em>Novoa, Jones, </em>and <em>Ranghelle (supra) </em>for its conclusion that harmless error analysis was not appropriate with respect to a <em>Rosario </em>violation. A Judge of this Court granted the People\u2019s motion for leave to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">IL</p>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">Prior to our holding in <em>Rosario, </em>a defendant was permitted to inspect only those statements of prosecution witnesses that contained matter inconsistent with the testimony given by the witness on the stand <em>(see, e.g., People v Walsh, </em>262 NY 140, 149). In <em>Rosario, </em>we concluded that \"a right sense of justice entitles the defense to examine a witness\u2019 prior statement, whether or not it varies from his testimony on the stand\u201d <em>(id., </em>at 289). \"As long as the statement relates to the subject matter of the witness\u2019 testimony and contains nothing that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>must be kept confidential, defense counsel should be allowed to determine for themselves the use to be made of it on cross-examination\u201d <em>(id., </em>at 289). The Court reasoned that \"single-minded counsel for the accused\u201d was better able than the presiding Judge to assess the usefulness of witness statements for impeachment purposes <em>(id., </em>at 290). We acknowledged at that time that our decision \"turn[ed] largely on policy considerations\u201d <em>(id., </em>at 289). Thus, our characterization of this decision as policy based is not, as the dissent would suggest, a post hoc departure from reason and logic, but a reiteration of the rationale for the decision, in the very language used by the <em>Rosario </em>majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">The per se error rule is not found in <em>Rosario, </em>however. In that case, the Court applied a harmless error analysis, looking to whether \"there was a rational possibility that the jury would have reached a different verdict if the defense had been allowed the use of the witness\u2019 prior statements\u201d <em>(id., </em>at 291). The Court concluded that the violation at issue in <em>Rosario </em>was indeed harmless and affirmed the defendant\u2019s judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">As noted above, this Court first applied the per se error rule in <em>People v Consolazio </em>(40 NY2d, at 454, <em>supra). </em>In <em>People v Perez (supra), </em>we explained our adherence to the per se error rule by looking to the policy considerations that had led to the <em>Rosario </em>decision. We noted that \"[t]he essence of the <em>Rosario </em>requirement, that the prosecutor supply all of a witness\u2019 statement or statements relating to his testimony, is that a judge\u2019s impartial determination as to what portions may be useful to the defense, is no substitute for the single-minded devotion of counsel for the accused. Appellate judges have no advantage over trial judges in making such a determination\u201d <em>(People v Perez, supra, </em>at 160).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">We again applied the per se error rule in <em>People v Ranghelle (supra) </em>in which we refused to recognize a good-faith exception that would excuse the prosecution\u2019s failure to turn over <em>Rosario </em>material <em>(People v Ranghelle, supra, </em>at 63). In <em>People v Jones (supra), </em>the People argued that <em>Ranghelle </em>was an illogical and aberrational decision that would wreak havoc on the criminal justice system of this State. In the face of this direct challenge to the line of per se error cases culminating in <em>Ranghelle, </em>we refused to cut back on our commitment to the per se error rule for <em>Rosario </em>claims. In <em>Jones </em>a majority of the Court stated that \"[i]t is <em>defense counsel alone </em>who has the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>responsibility for making the strategic judgments and doing the careful preparation required for planning and executing an effective cross-examination of the People\u2019s witnesses and deciding whether and how to use the statements. When, as a result of the prosecutor\u2019s violation of the <em>Rosario </em>rule, defense counsel has been deprived of material of which he or she is unaware or cannot otherwise obtain, there is no way, short of speculation, of determining how it might have been used or how its denial to counsel might have damaged defendant\u2019s case\u201d <em>(People v Jones, supra, </em>at 552).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">At the same time as we stated the per se error rule and imposed stringent penalties on prosecutors who failed to comply with their <em>Rosario </em>obligations, we recognized certain commonsense limitations on the scope of those obligations. Thus, in <em>People v Poole </em>(48 NY2d 144), we refused to hold that the defendant had an unfettered right to inspect all of the documents contained in the prosecutor\u2019s files in order to determine for himself whether any of the material would be useful. We stated that to allow unrestricted access to prosecution files would \"extend the letter and spirit of <em>Rosario </em>and its progeny beyond its legitimate purpose \u2014 to afford the defendant a fair opportunity to use a witness\u2019 prior relevant statements for impeachment purposes\u201d <em>(People v Poole, supra, </em>at 149-150). And in <em>Consolazio (supra), </em>even as we applied the per se error rule for the first time, we held that it was not error for the prosecution to fail to turn over worksheets that were the \"duplicative equivalents\u201d of documents that were already turned over as <em>Rosario </em>material <em>(People v Consolazio, supra, </em>at 454).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\"><em>Rosario </em>is not based on the State or Federal Constitution. It is, in essence, a discovery rule, based on a deeply held belief that simple fairness requires the defendant to be supplied with prosecution reports and statements that could conceivably aid in the defense\u2019s cross-examination of prosecution witnesses. As <em>Rosario </em>became more entrenched in the criminal jurisprudence of this State, we adopted a per se error rule that afforded the defendant\u2019s cross-examination rights even greater protection and attached significant penalties to the failure to turn over <em>Rosario </em>material. Even if the failure was inadvertent and even if the prosecutor argued that the withheld material was trivial, the defendant was to receive a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">Applying a per se error rule in the <em>Rosario </em>cases that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>reached this Court on direct appeal was thus a policy decision, grounded in our recognition that to permit harmless error analysis in <em>Rosario </em>cases was to speculate as to the uses to which <em>Rosario </em>material could have been put, something that was contrary to the spirit of fairness that animated the <em>Rosario </em>decision. We are now at another crucial point in the development of our <em>Rosario </em>case law. In this case, the normal appellate process was exhausted <em>6V2 </em>years ago. The crime occurred 13 years ago. Because there is no time limit on the filing of CPL 440.10 motions, this set of facts is by no means aberrational. CPL 440.10 motions could conceivably be filed decades after direct appeal has been completed. Thus, we now confront new policy considerations and must again balance society\u2019s interests against those of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">This time, however, we are not guided solely by the weight of our own precedent. The defendant is resting his challenge upon a statute, and we therefore direct our attention to the statutory language that maps out the scope of the remedy he seeks. CPL 440.10 does not contain a separate prong that is clearly applicable to <em>Rosario </em>cases. There are two that might arguably apply: the newly discovered evidence prong (CPL 440.10 [1] [g]) and the \"[i]mproper and prejudicial conduct\u201d prong (CPL 440.10 [1] [f]). Both of these paragraphs require some showing of prejudice before a defendant will be entitled to have a judgment of conviction vacated: CPL 440.10 (1) (f) by its very terms requires that the conduct at issue on the motion be \"[i]mproper and prejudicial\u201d and that \"it * * * would have required a reversal of the judgment upon an appeal therefrom,\u201d while CPL 440.10 (1) (g) requires that the newly discovered evidence be \"of such character as to create a probability that had such evidence been received at the trial the verdict would have been more favorable to the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">We believe that <em>Rosario </em>claims are most appropriately raised under CPL 440.10 (1) (f), the \"[i]mproper and prejudicial conduct\u201d paragraph <em>(cf., People v Howard, </em>127 AD2d 109, 118). We reach this conclusion for several reasons. First, it has been held that evidence that tends to impeach a trial witness\u2019 testimony is not the sort of \"newly discovered evidence\u201d that would entitle a defendant to a new trial <em>(see, e.g., People v Powell, </em>96 AD2d 610; <em>People v Wood, </em>94 AD2d 849, 850). Yet the very purpose of the <em>Rosario </em>decision is to give defendants an opportunity to use relevant witness statements for impeachment purposes. Thus, in that <em>Rosario </em>material is accorded protection precisely because it can be used to impeach <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>trial witnesses, prior precedent suggests that such material could never constitute the sort of newly discovered evidence that would entitle the defendant to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">Second, the <em>Rosario </em>decision is not grounded in the same policy concerns as the newly discovered evidence paragraph of CPL 440.10 (1), which is concerned primarily with the exculpatory value of the newly discovered material. <em>Rosario </em>material is treated differently not because it is exculpatory, but because basic fairness dictates that a defendant be given the opportunity to evaluate pretrial statements of prosecution witnesses for their impeachment value. Although fairness to the defendant obviously underlies both the <em>Rosario </em>decision and CPL 440.10 (1) (g), there are significant differences in the values sought to be advanced by the two.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">Consequently, we believe that these claims are better raised under CPL 440.10 (1) (f), the paragraph applicable to improper and prejudicial conduct. The <em>Rosario </em>decision, presently codified at CPL 240.45 (1) (a), imposes a definite duty upon the prosecution to turn over pretrial statements of prosecution witnesses that relate to the subject matter of the witnesses\u2019 testimony. Failure to comply with this duty, however inadvertent, violates both statutory and common-law mandates and is consequently improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">To prevail under CPL 440.10 (1) (f), however, a defendant must do more than demonstrate that the conduct at issue was improper. The statute by its very terms affords a remedy only if the defendant\u2019s trial was affected by conduct that was both improper and prejudicial. The statute compels an inquiry into the presence or absence of prejudice. This requirement is directly related to society\u2019s interest in the finality of judgments. There is no time limit on the filing of CPL 440.10 motions. As time passes, evidence is misplaced, witnesses disappear and once vivid memories of a crime begin to fade into uncertainty. All of this has a profound effect upon the People\u2019s ability to retry a defendant years after direct appeal has been exhausted. At common law, defendants seeking a writ of error coram nobis were required to demonstrate prejudice, and this requirement was based in part upon society\u2019s interest in the finality of judgments <em>(see generally, </em>Fuld, <em>The Writ of Error Coram Nobis, </em>NYLJ, June 5, 1947, at 2212, col 1; <em>People v Howard, </em>12 NY2d 65; <em>see also, People v Wilkins, </em>28 NY2d 53; 18 Am Jur 2d, Coram Nobis, \u00a7 13, at 633). The Legislature carried the prejudice requirement forward when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>the common-law remedy was codified in CPL 440.10. Once the Legislature has established a remedy, the terms of the applicable statute control the scope of that remedy <em>(see, e.g., People v Corso, </em>40 NY2d 578). Presumably, the Legislature, in balancing the competing policy concerns, including its own right sense of justice, recognized the need for defendants to receive their punishment, unless they were able to show that they were entitled to the statutory remedy and that they had been prejudiced by the trial error that was at issue in the motion to vacate.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">It is for us, however, to look at the statutory requirement of prejudice and to determine the reading that this language should be given. In fulfilling our judicial function, we cannot by the force of our own precedent render the prejudice requirement a nullity. Nor can we ignore the underlying legislative purpose of that requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">In including a prejudice requirement in CPL 440.10 (1) (f), the Legislature was concerned about society\u2019s interest in finality of judgments. We too recognize this interest is formidable. As we have already noted, the language of the statute contains no limitation on the time period during which such motions can be filed. Defendants can thus avail themselves of the statutory remedy many years after the normal appellate process has been completed. In that the passage of time greatly affects the People\u2019s ability to retry a defendant, we think it would be imprudent to read the prejudice requirement out of the statute by taking the per se error rule and applying it in CPL 440.10 context. To assume prejudice without requiring the defendant to demonstrate actual prejudice would eviscerate the language of CPL 440.10 (1) (f) and the concern for finality that underlies this language.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">We therefore conclude that Judges conducting CPL 440.10 hearings should not assume the existence of prejudice simply because the defendant has stated a <em>Rosario </em>claim. In fulfilling our duty as common-law Judges to interpret statutory language, we believe that a defendant raising a <em>Rosario </em>claim by way of a CPL 440.10 motion must make a showing of prejudice. We will not step in and cut off that inquiry. Neither our precedent nor our concern for fairness to the defendant requires that result.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-8\">We take issue with the dissent\u2019s statement that our decision today \"cannot be justified by statutory language, precedent or a priori logic\u201d (dissenting opn, at 654-655). In assigning mean<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>ing to the term \"prejudice\u201d in the context of CPL 440.10 (1) (f) motions, we are guided by the legislative purpose behind the prejudice requirement and by our recognition that postconviction motions to vacate and direct appeal are procedurally and conceptually quite different. We refuse to concede that a series of cases, generated in a wholly distinct procedural posture, restrain our ability to think critically about the issues presented on this appeal. We are well aware that adherence to precedent is at the heart of common-law decision-making. However, we do not accept the dissent\u2019s suggestion that the balance struck in the per se error cases controls the result in this case, in which statutory language, legislative history, and societal interests in finality \u2014 factors never before considered in the <em>Rosario </em>context \u2014 all dictate the opposite result.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">This holding does not represent a de facto elimination of the per se error rule, as the dissent contends. In the 31 years since <em>Rosario </em>was decided, this case is the first before this Court to raise a <em>Rosario </em>violation in the context of a CPL 440.10 motion brought after direct appeal was completed. This suggests to us that applying the per se error rule up until the completion of the appellate process and applying the rule we articulate today thereafter will as a practical matter not affect the vast majority of defendants who raise <em>Rosario </em>claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">In <em>Rosario, Consolazio, Ranghelle </em>and the other per se error cases, we struck a balance. We were not impelled by constitutional mandates to make the choices that we did. Rather, we were motivated by a desire to treat defendants fairly. Unlike the dissent, however, we believe that our decision today, striking a different balance, is indeed grounded in reason and logic. We have attempted to bring both to bear in our articulation of a rule that is fair to the defendant but that takes into account the nature of the collateral remedy and the interests implicated by that remedy. The existence of the Judge-made per se error rule does not permit us to subvert the language of CPL 440.10 (1) (f) with impunity. Ultimately, it is our responsibility as Judges to harmonize the common-law rule and the statutory remedy as far as practicable. This is what we seek to do today.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">In light of our holding in this case, we now spell out the degree of prejudice that a defendant with a <em>Rosario </em>claim must show in order to prevail on a motion to vacate brought under CPL 440.10 (1) (f). Having reviewed <em>Rosario </em>and the per se error cases and looked for guidance to <em>People v Vilardi </em>(76 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>NY2d 67), we hold that a defendant who was deprived of <em>Rosario </em>material and who consequently seeks to vacate a conviction under CPL 440.10 (1) (f) must demonstrate a reasonable possibility that the failure to disclose the <em>Rosario </em>material contributed to the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">We reach this conclusion for several reasons. First, it is the standard used by the majority in <em>Rosario </em>itself <em>(id., </em>at 291), and for that reason is certainly consistent with the policy considerations that first led this Court to implement the <em>Rosario </em>rule. Second, it is the standard that is currently in use for <em>Brady </em>material, where the prosecutor was placed on notice by a specific discovery request that the defendant considered the material important to the defense <em>(see, People v Vilardi, supra, </em>at 77). Thus, while a per se error rule will continue to apply to <em>Rosario </em>but not <em>Brady </em>claims on direct appeal, there will now be a certain congruence in the treatment of <em>Rosario </em>and <em>Brady </em>claims raised by way of CPL 440.10 motions after direct appeal has been exhausted. Finally, we conclude that this is the most equitable standard for ascertaining whether prejudice resulted from <em>Rosario </em>violations. Any other standard would create too great a disparity between the treatment of these claims on direct appeal, where a per se error rule continues to apply, and on postconviction motion, where, as we hold today, CPL 440.10 requires a finding that the defendant was prejudiced by the failure to turn over <em>Rosario </em>material.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">In conclusion, we would like to emphasize that the per se error rule is still the law in this State when a <em>Rosario </em>claim is the subject of a direct appeal from a judgment of conviction. We continue to believe that defense counsel is in a far better position than the Trial Judge to determine the impeachment value of <em>Rosario </em>material. In addition, our holding in <em>People v Novoa </em>(70 NY2d 490, <em>supra) </em>establishes that where a <em>Rosario </em>claim is the subject of both a direct appeal and a postconviction motion brought under CPL 440.10, the per se error rule will also apply. Where direct appeal has been exhausted, however, and the defendant seeks to vacate a judgment solely by way of a CPL 440.10 motion, the terms of that statute control. The interest in finality implicated by CPL 440.10 motions, has led us to conclude that defendants must be prepared to show that actual, ascertainable prejudice resulted from the <em>Rosario </em>violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">The dissent terms the procedural distinctions we draw today <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>\"arbitrary\u201d (dissenting opn, at 656). We, by contrast, view them as part of an effort to balance the rights of the defendant against the interests of society. The dissent is correct to point out that we are greatly concerned about the possibility that significant periods of time may elapse between the affirmance of a defendant\u2019s conviction on appeal and the filing of a CPL 440.10 motion. But this does not in any way diminish our commitment to treating defendants fairly. Thus, our decision to treat CPL 440.10 motions differently depending upon whether the defendant has exhausted direct review is not a product of whim or caprice. Rather, it is a reflection of our ongoing effort to accommodate both society\u2019s interest in finality and the defendant\u2019s right to examine impeachment evidence. We have endeavored to fashion a rule that addressed our concerns regarding the infinite duration of the CPL 440.10 remedy without undermining the fairness concerns that are at the core of <em>Rosario. </em>Contrary to the dissent, we believe that our holding today achieves that result.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">Because both the trial court and the Appellate Division determined that the per se error rule applied to the defendant\u2019s <em>Rosario </em>claim, he was not required to show that he had been prejudiced by the <em>Rosario </em>violation. Therefore, defendant is entitled to a CPL 440.10 hearing in order to permit defendant to establish that there was a reasonable possibility that the failure to turn over <em>Rosario </em>material contributed to the verdict against him. In addition, he should be permitted to address those claims that were not reached below as a result of the disposition of his <em>Rosario </em>claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be reversed, and the case remitted to Supreme Court, Kings County, for further proceedings in accordance with the opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b720-7\">Titone, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ABn\">(dissenting). After reading the majority\u2019s opinion, one is left with the impression that rules of law are merely matters of policy preferences to be invoked, modified or simply ignored when their consequence are, in the eyes of four members of this Court, inconvenient or undesirable. Indeed, the word \"policy\u201d appears no less than 11 times in the majority\u2019s opinion and at least seven references are made to balancing society\u2019s and defendant\u2019s interests, as though the mere repetition of those concepts alone has the power to persuade. What constitutes good policy, however, is within the eyes of the beholder. Since the practical effect of the Court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>decision here will be to make relief for <em>Rosario </em>violations virtually unavailable in postconviction proceedings, the result can hardly be characterized as \"equitable\u201d or good policy from the viewpoint of an aggrieved defendant unfortunate enough to be relegated to such proceedings <em>(see, </em>majority opn, at 649). Further, despite the majority\u2019s efforts to place the burden of responsibility for its policy choice on the language of the applicable statute, there is nothing in the language of CPL 440.10 (1) (f) that requires such a dramatic departure from the clear rule that has governed the disposition of <em>Rosario </em>claims in direct appeals for the past 15 years <em>(see, People v Jones, </em>70 NY2d 547, 553; <em>People v Novoa, </em>70 NY2d 490, 499; <em>People v Ranghelle, </em>69 NY2d 56, 63; <em>People v Perez, </em>65 NY2d 154, 160; <em>People v Consolazio, </em>40 NY2d 446, 454, <em>cert denied </em>433 US 914). To the contrary, the logic and values that inform that rule compel its application in CPL 440.10 proceedings. Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">In <em>People v Rosario </em>(9 NY2d 286, 289), this Court held that \"a right sense of justice\u201d requires that before cross-examinatian the People must turn over to the defense the pretrial statements of prosecution witnesses pertaining to the subject matter of their testimony. Fifteen years later, in <em>People v Consolazio </em>(40 NY2d, at 454, <em>supra), </em>we made clear that a failure on the part of the People to disclose such material could not \"be excused on the ground that [it] would have been of limited or of no use to the defense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">To read the majority\u2019s opinion, one would think that this rule was nothing more than a bit of judicial legislation grounded in policy choice rather than logic and reason <em>(see, </em>majority opn, at 641 [\"(i)n originally adopting the per se error rule, we balanced the rights of the defendant against the rights of society and arrived at a policy designed to foster\u201d the <em>Rosario </em>goals]; <em>id., </em>at 644-645 [\"(a)pplying a per se error rule * * * was * * * a policy decision\u201d]; <em>see also, id., </em>at 643 [\"our decision 'turn(ed) largely on policy considerations\u2019 \u201d]). However, nothing could be further from the truth.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As the Chief Judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>himself explained in <em>People v Perez </em>(65 NY2d, at 160, <em>supra), </em>the \"essence of the <em>Rosario </em>requirement * * * is that a judge\u2019s impartial determination as to what portions [of a witness\u2019s pretrial statements] may be useful to the defense, is no substitute for the single-minded devotion of counsel for the accused.\u201d For that reason, the <em>Perez </em>Court concluded, a harmless error analysis based on the relative probative worth of the withheld evidence is inappropriate <em>(accord, People v Ranghelle, </em>69 NY2d 56, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">The subject was once again explored in <em>People Jones </em>(70 NY2d 547, <em>supra), </em>in which this Court squarely and firmly rejected an argument by the People that the <em>Consolazio-Perez-Ranghelle </em>line of cases should be overruled. Echoing and expanding upon the analysis of the <em>Perez </em>Court, we stated that \"[t]he nature and purpose of <em>Rosario\u201d </em>make it \"impossible\u201d to apply traditional harmless error analysis based on the quantum and nature of the People\u2019s proof and the causal effect of the error on the outcome (70 NY2d, at 551). We explained: \"When, as a result of the prosecutor\u2019s violation of the <em>Rosario </em>rule, defense counsel has been deprived of material of which he or she is unaware or cannot otherwise obtain, there is no way, short of speculation, of determining how it might have been used or how its denial to counsel might have damaged defendant\u2019s case\u201d <em>(id., </em>at 552). Since the <em>Jones </em>Court believed that such speculation would \"undermine the very basis of our prior decisions,\u201d it declined to apply a harmless error analysis based on the evidentiary value of the undisclosed material <em>(id., </em>at 552; <em>see also, People v Novoa, </em>70 NY2d, at 499, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">A bare four-Judge majority has chosen a different conclusion in this case, not because the procedural posture of CPL 440.10 proceedings makes the harmless error inquiry any less \"impossible,\u201d but rather because, in its view, a showing of particularized prejudice is specifically required by the language of the applicable provision, CPL 440.10 (1) (f). In this regard, however, the present majority\u2019s rationale is nothing more than an exercise in result-directed statutory construction that simply does not withstand scrutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">The term \"prejudice],\u201d as used in CPL 440.10 (1) (f) and elsewhere in the Criminal Procedure Law, is fraught with ambiguity. It is a word that has no single meaning; rather, it takes on whatever significance logic and reason would give it in the context in which it is being used. Thus, in cases involving errors in the admission or exclusion of evidence, the term \"prejudice\u201d may fairly be used to refer to the probable effect of the error on the outcome, and the degree of \"prejudice\u201d may be assessed by considering \"the nature and the inherent probative worth of the evidence\u201d <em>(People v Crimmins, </em>36 NY2d 230, 241). In cases involving other classes of errors, however, the nature and quantum of proof is irrelevant in determining what constitutes \"prejudice\u201d <em>(see, People v Felder, </em>47 NY2d 287, 296), and the inquiry requires a more subtle analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">For example, errors in the trial court\u2019s closing instructions that deprive the defendant of his right to jury consideration of the crime elements are deemed prejudicial \" '[n]o matter how conclusive the evidence\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v Lewis, </em>64 NY2d 1031, 1032, quoting <em>People v Walker, </em>198 NY 329, 334). Similarly, errors affecting the jury\u2019s deliberative process have been held prejudicial to the extent they tend to \"compromise\u201d that process, without regard to the strength of the People\u2019s case <em>(see, e.g., People v Brown, </em>48 NY2d 388, 395). Cases involving deprivations of the basic right to representation by counsel are also generally not subjected to traditional harmless error analysis <em>(see, e.g., People v Hilliard, </em>73 NY2d 584; <em>People v Felder, supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b723-7\"><em>People v O\u2019Rama </em>(78 NY2d 270, 279-280) is particularly pertinent in this context. In that case, the trial court had violated its statutory duty to notify defense counsel of the precise contents of a juror inquiry <em>(see, </em>CPL 310.30). We concluded that reversal was required notwithstanding the defendant\u2019s inability to show \"specific prejudice\u201d because the court\u2019s error had deprived defendant of \"the opportunity to have input, through counsel * * * into the court\u2019s response to an important, substantive juror inquiry\u201d and that, as a consequence, the error was <em>\"inherently </em>prejudicial\u201d (78 NY2d, at 279-280). Significantly, the opinion in <em>O\u2019Rama </em>drew an analogy to the recent <em>Rosario </em>cases in which reversal was held required without regard to a showing of specific prejudice (78 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>NY2d, at 279-280, citing <em>People v Jones, supra; People v Perez, supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">The teaching of <em>O\u2019Rama </em>and the other above-cited cases is that certain kinds of errors occurring during trial are intrinsically prejudicial because they either detract from the process or impair the defendant\u2019s ability to present a defense. In such instances, a so-called \"per se\u201d rule of reversal is applied. The use. of the term \"per se\u201d in this context does not denote a complete absence of prejudice; rather, it represents a shorthand way of saying that errors within that class are prejudicial by their very nature and that, accordingly, nothing further need be shown to compel reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">That is precisely what this Court had in mind when it applied a \"per se\u201d rule of reversal in <em>Jones, Perez, Consolazio, Novoa </em>and <em>Ranghelle. </em>When a prosecutor fails to disclose <em>Rosario </em>material during trial, the defense is deprived of the opportunity to make the necessary strategic judgments and do \"the careful preparation required for planning and executing an effective cross-examination\u201d <em>(People v Jones, </em>70 NY2d, at 552, <em>supra). </em>Further, the defense has been prevented from exploring potential areas of weakness in the prosecution\u2019s evidence. This deprivation goes to the heart of counsel\u2019s ability to provide a meaningful defense and, consequently, is \"prejudicial\u201d in the same sense that the error in <em>People v O\u2019Rama (supra, </em>279-280) was prejudicial to the defense in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">Thus, contrary to the majority\u2019s central argument, CPL 440.10 (1) (f)\u2019s requirement of \"prejudice\u201d does not provide a justification for abandoning in this context the <em>Rosario </em>per se rule that has been applied for the past 15 years in direct appeals. Indeed, if \"prejudice\u201d had not been present in <em>Jones, Ranghelle, Perez </em>and <em>Consolazio, </em>we would have been guilty of exceeding our powers as an appellate court, since CPL 470.05 (1), which applies to direct appeals, dictates that we determine appeals \"without regard to technical errors or <em>defects which do not affect the substantial rights of the parties\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied). Surely, the majority cannot seriously suggest that the term \"prejudice]\u201d in CPL 440.10 (1) (f) means something different from the impairment of the \"substantial rights\u201d of the accused that CPL 470.05 (1) requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">In the final analysis, the majority\u2019s choice to r\u00e9ach a different result under CPL 440.10 (1) (f) than under CPL 470.05 (1) cannot be justified by statutory language, precedent or a priori <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>logic. Thus, in reality, it must be premised solely on what the majority terms a choice of \"policy\u201d \u2014 the majority\u2019s current code word for its four members\u2019 unwillingness to apply a well-settled rule of law in such a way as to produce vacaturs of previously settled criminal convictions. In my view, this choice is unsound and, indeed, indefensible.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">The majority\u2019s policy choice is objectionable not only because it ignores recent and settled precedent, but also because it is so one-sided. The particularized prejudice standard that the majority has embraced requires a \"reasonable possibility that the failure to disclose the <em>Rosario </em>material contributed to the verdict\u201d (majority opn, at 649). The majority gives no particular reason for choosing this standard, other than its use in the original <em>Rosario </em>decision (9 NY2d 286, <em>cert denied </em>368 US 866, <em>supra) </em>and its congruence with the rule now applied in New York in <em>Brady </em>violation cases <em>(Brady v Maryland, 373 </em>US 83; <em>see, People v Vilardi, </em>76 NY2d 67). In view of the substantial differences between the goals and purposes of the <em>Rosario </em>and <em>Brady </em>rules, however, this congruence alone can hardly provide a sound basis for such a profound change in the law. And, the use of the standard in the original <em>Rosario </em>decision is certainly not a persuasive point, since that standard has long been superseded by the per se rule of reversal developed in <em>Consolazio </em>and its progeny.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">Most significantly, the use of this standard, which was tailored for <em>Brady </em>cases, will, as a practical matter, eliminate the possibility of a remedy for most defendants who, through no fault of their own, do not discover <em>Rosario </em>violations until after sentence is imposed. The majority\u2019s rule mandates an assessment of the factual significance of the undisclosed material in light of the admitted trial evidence. However, as stated in <em>People v Jones </em>(70 NY2d 547, 551-553, <em>supra), </em>it is simply impossible for a reviewing court to determine whether the outcome of a particular case may have been affected by the prosecution\u2019s failure to turn over a pretrial statement of one of its witnesses <em>(accord, People v Perez, </em>65 NY2d, at 160, <em>supra). </em>Indeed, the evidentiary value of <em>Rosario </em>material is often not even discernible to defense counsel until after he or she has had an opportunity to use it as a basis for cross-examination, since even the most seemingly innocuous material may open new avenues of impeachment that could not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>have been foreseen before the witness\u2019s responses were heard. Thus, as the majority is well aware, the cases in which the requisite showing can be made will be few and far between. In fact, since the majority opinion does not even attempt to explain why the inquiry it mandates will be any more fair or any less \"impossible\u201d in postconviction proceedings than it would have been in the appeals in <em>Perez (supra), Consolazio (supra), Ranghelle (supra) </em>or <em>Jones (supra), </em>the conclusion is inescapable that the Court\u2019s previously expressed concern for fairness in the adjudicative process has, at least in this context, been supplanted with a concern to protect existing convictions, particularly where the passage of time \"affects the People\u2019s ability to retry [the] defendant\u201d (majority opn, at 647; <em>see, id., </em>at 646).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">That the majority\u2019s central concern lies with the age, rather than the underlying fairness, of the convictions challenged in this and similar cases is evident not only from its many explicit references to that consideration <em>(see, </em>majority opn, at 640, 645, 646, 647, 650), but also from the peculiar exception it has created for cases where the <em>Rosario </em>claim \"is the subject of both a direct appeal and a postconviction motion brought under CPL 440.10\u201d (majority opn, at 649). Presumably, this exception does not run afoul of the majority\u2019s \"policy\u201d concerns because it implicates only the most recent convictions in the system, convictions which are vulnerable in any case as long as a direct appeal is pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-7\">The ostensible justification for recognizing what might otherwise appear to be an arbitrary \"exception\u201d is the authority of <em>People v Novoa </em>(70 NY2d 490, <em>supra), </em>in which, according to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>the majority, the <em>Rosario </em>claim \"was the subject of both direct appeal and a CPL 440.10 motion\u201d and \"was treated as a direct appeal for procedural purposes\u201d (majority opn, at 641; <em>see also, id., </em>at 649). This characterization of <em>Novoa, </em>however, reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of appellate procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">In fact, the material that formed the basis of the <em>Rosario </em>claim in <em>Novoa </em>was not discovered until more than a year after judgment was entered <em>(see, </em>70 NY2d, at 494, <em>supra). </em>Accordingly, it was not part of the record on the direct appeal and could not have been considered on that appeal, absent a discretionary order by the Appellate Division to \"expand\u201d the record <em>(cf., People v Perez, supra). </em>Further, since the existence of the material was not known during the trial, there was neither a \"protest\u201d nor a judicial \"ruling\u201d on the record underlying the judgment and, thus, the <em>Rosario </em>claim presented no \"question of law\u201d for this Court to review on the direct appeal <em>(see, </em>CPL 470.05 [2]).</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">In truth, the <em>only </em>ruling on which this Court could have reversed in <em>Novoa </em>was the trial court\u2019s order denying the convicted defendant\u2019s postjudgment motion for relief following a full hearing <em>(see, </em>70 NY2d, at 495-496, <em>supra) </em>\u2014 an order which was not cognizable on the direct appeal. Indeed, as its primary reason for reversing, the <em>Novoa </em>Court specifically cited its disagreement with the trial court\u2019s analysis <em>on the postjudgment motion. </em>Accordingly, unless the <em>Novoa </em>Court was seriously mistaken in its appreciation of the procedural posture of the case before it, it simply cannot be said that the <em>Rosario </em>claim was either \"the subject of [the] direct appeal\u201d or \"treated as a direct appeal for procedural purposes\u201d <em>(see, </em>majority opn, at 641; <em>see also, id., </em>at 649).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">When stripped of its supposed precedential support in <em>Novoa, </em>the exception that the majority has created for cases where the <em>Rosario </em>claim \"is the subject of both a direct appeal and a postconviction motion\u201d is exposed as an arbitrary and unrealistic attempt at expediency. It is arbitrary because it makes the availability of the per se reversal rule turn on the fortuity of whether the undisclosed <em>Rosario </em>material is discovered before or after the intermediate appellate court has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>heard and determined the direct appeal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It is unrealistic for the simple reason that, as discussed above, the procedural principles governing appeals make the existence of the conditions for the exception, at best, unlikely.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">Finally, if policy considerations are to be the touchstone, the Court should also consider the effect that its decision will have, on both the administration of the <em>Rosario </em>rule and on the behavior of prosecutors. Viewed against both of these yardsticks, the majority\u2019s holding falls short.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">First, by establishing a separate standard for reversal in CPL 440.10 cases, the majority has left little room for the <em>Consolazio-Perez-Ranghelle-Jones </em>per se rule of reversal to operate. In cases where the undisclosed <em>Rosario </em>material comes to light before the close of evidence, the error will likely be treated as a \u201cmere delay\u201d and appellate reversal will depend upon \u201cwhether the defense was substantially prejudiced\u201d <em>(People v Ranghelle, </em>69 NY2d, at 63, <em>supra). </em>In cases where the failure to disclose becomes apparent only after entry of judgment, the majority\u2019s new rule will apply and reversal will also be contingent on a particularized showing of actual prejudice.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Significantly, in such cases, the <em>Rosario </em>doctrine itself will have little utility, since a defendant who can meet the majority\u2019s new test can, by definition, also obtain vacatur under the <em>Brady-Vilardi </em>standard, without regard to <em>Rosario. </em>What remains of the <em>Consolazio-Perez-Ranghelle-Jones </em>per se reversal rule is, then, its availability in that narrow category of cases in which the defense learns of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>prosecution\u2019s failure to fulfill its <em>Rosario </em>obligations sometime after the close of evidence and before the entry of judgment <em>(see, People v Ranghelle, supra, </em>at 62). Such a narrowing of the rule\u2019s reach is hardly consistent with the majority\u2019s expressed continuing \"commitment\u201d to the <em>Rosario </em>doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">Second, the rule the majority adopts will lead to an unacceptable disparity in the administration of the <em>Rosario </em>rule. On the one hand, defendants who are able to demonstrate on direct appeal the existence of a complete failure to disclose <em>Rosario </em>material will be entitled to a new trial without further inquiry. In contrast, defendants who have equally meritorious <em>Rosario </em>claims but are relegated to CPL 440.10 challenges will be required to make a particularized showing of actual prejudice and, for the reasons discussed above, are unlikely to succeed. This disparity is especially troubling because it makes the outcome depend largely upon the timing of disclosure, a matter that is solely within the People\u2019s control.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">Third, because the timing of disclosure will now be all b\u00fct dispositive, the rule the majority adopts creates a strong incentive for prosecutors who belatedly discover potential <em>Rosario </em>material to postpone disclosure until after sentencing, when the record available for direct appeal is closed and the only remedy the defendant has is to seek CPL 440.10 postjudgment relief. Such a result is objectionable because it rewards prosecutorial gamesmanship and runs directly counter to the underlying <em>Rosario </em>policy of encouraging prompt and full disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-8\">In closing, I would note my fundamental disagreement with this majority\u2019s approach to judicial decision-making, which emphasizes policy considerations over logic and precedent. One obvious problem with this approach is that it renders the law susceptible to sudden directional changes based upon nothing more than a change in the prevailing judicial sentiment or even \"the accident of a change in [the Court\u2019s] composition\u201d <em>(Simpson v Loehmann, </em>21 NY2d 305, 314 [Breitel, J., concurring]). Today, for example, the Court has reduced the <em>Consolazio-Perez-Ranghelle-Jones </em>principle from a logically necessary corollary of the <em>Rosario </em>rule to a mere policy choice. While today\u2019s majority professes its continued devotion to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>basic principle,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> this demotion certainly opens the way for its further curtailment \u2014 or even its reversal \u2014 since a rule based on policy alone is readily susceptible to attack by a court that wishes to emphasize other values or policy considerations <em>(compare, People v Bing, </em>76 NY2d 331, <em>with People v Bartolomeo, </em>53 NY2d 225).</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">To be sure, we in the judiciary must operate in the real world, and our decision-making must reflect sensitivity to the practical consequences, as well as the legal and theoretical implications. Ultimately, however, our responsibility in the judiciary is to apply reasoning and precedent with a view toward fairness, both to society <em>and </em>the accused. While society\u2019s interest in the finality of criminal convictions is, no doubt, an important value, so too is society\u2019s interest in the \"fundamental objective\u201d of providing the accused with a fair opportunity to test the People\u2019s witnesses through the crucible of cross-examination \u2014 the value that informs the <em>Rosario </em>rule <em>(see, People v Jones, supra, </em>at 550, quoting <em>People v Perez, supra, </em>at 158). To the extent that we remain committed to that value, we are also duty bound to uphold it even in contexts where the consequences may be viewed by some as undesirable. Indeed, as has been noted in another context, if a court is \"really committed to\u201d a particular principle, \"its subsequent decisions * * * [should] nourish\u201d rather than undermine it <em>(People v Bing, supra, </em>at 343).</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">In sum, I find no reason to depart from the principle that this Court established in <em>People v Consolazio (supra) </em>and has followed without deviation for some 15 years, despite numerous challenges <em>(see, People v Jones, supra; People v Novoa, </em>70 NY2d, at 499, <em>supra). </em>In the absence of a persuasive statutory or precedential ground for altering the standard based on the procedural context in which the <em>Rosario </em>challenge is raised, I conclude that a CPL 440.10 motion to vacate a judgment because of the prosecution\u2019s failure to deliver <em>Rosario </em>material must be granted \u2014 without regard to particularized prejudice\u2014 to the same extent that such a failure would constitute error requiring reversal on direct appeal. Accordingly, I vote to affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>Judges Simons, Kaye and Bellacosa concur with Chief Judge Wachtler; Judge Titone dissents and votes to affirm in a separate opinion in which Judges Alexander and Hancock, Jr., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">Order reversed, etc.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b721-7\">. The majority\u2019s reliance on the use of a policy justification in <em>Rosario </em>is misplaced <em>(see, </em>majority opn, at 643), since the issue in this case is not whether the <em>Rosario </em>doctrine itself should be available in postconviction challenges, but rather, whether the per se rule of reversal, which was extrapolated as a natural and logical corollary of <em>Rosario, </em>should also be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>available. As to this question, the rationale utilized in the line of cases establishing the latter rule is the proper source of guidance. Similarly the discussions delineating certain substantive limitations on the scope of the prosecutor\u2019s <em>Rosario </em>duty <em>(People v Poole, </em>48 NY2d 144; <em>People v Consolazio, </em>40 NY2d 446, 454), which the majority cites (majority opn, at 644), are completely irrelevant in this context.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b726-8\">. The majority notes that no prior <em>Rosario </em>challenges have reached this Court in precisely the same posture as this appeal and then extrapolates that \"applying the rule we articulate today * * * will as a practical matter not affect the vast majority of defendants who raise <em>Rosario </em>claims\u201d (majority opn, at 648). This apparent effort at apology will be cold comfort for those defendants relegated to CPL 440.10 proceedings. Futhermore, there is irony in the majority\u2019s present attempt to minimize the significance of its decision as inapplicable to \"the vast majority of defendants who raise <em>Rosario </em>claims.\u201d That assertion is directly contrary to the People\u2019s claim that if the per se rule were applied in CPL 440.10 proceedings, \"[e]very criminal conviction, regardless of its age or * * * fairness * * * would thereby be placed at risk\u201d \u2014 a contention that members of the majority have found very persuasive.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b727-8\">. While the <em>Novoa </em>Court may have overlooked the procedural posture in which the <em>Rosario </em>issue was presented because it was \"not asked to consider [it] at that time\u201d (majority opn, at 641), that circumstance cannot excuse the majority\u2019s <em>present </em>misapprehension about that question.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b728-8\">. Even where the <em>Rosario </em>material has been discovered before disposition of the direct appeal, there remains the possibility that the direct appeal will be determined before the CPL 440.10 motion based on the <em>Rosario </em>violation can be heard and determined. While the defendant in such situations can seek to have the disposition of the direct appeal held in abeyance, it seems capricious and unfair to make the availability of a more favorable standard of review turn upon the defendant\u2019s success in navigating such a series of procedural hurdles.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b728-9\">. I note that the prejudice required by the majority\u2019s decision here is not the same as the prejudice that the <em>Ranghelle </em>decision requires when disclosure is delayed but nonetheless made during trial. The latter includes any prejudice flowing from the impairments to the defense\u2019s trial strategy that were caused by the delayed disclosure. The former, in contrast, appears to permit relief only when the undisclosed evidence has self-evident probative worth that might have affected the guilt determination.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b730-7\">. I reserve a degree of skepticism about the majority\u2019s declared support for the <em>Consolazio-Perez-Ranghelle-Jones </em>rule, particularly since one of its four members has so recently called it an \"errant footstep\u201d and urged its reversal by the Legislature <em>(People v Jones, </em>70 NY2d 547, 553-557 [Bellacosa, J., concurring]).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
