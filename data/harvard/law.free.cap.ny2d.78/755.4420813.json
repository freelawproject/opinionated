The Division of Housing and Community Renewal has exclusive jurisdiction to grant certificates of eviction based on demolition. Alternatively, under the doctrine of primary jurisdiction, the trial court erred in assuming jurisdiction of a complex, technical matter of Statewide application which has been delegated by law to DHCR. <em>(520 E. 81st St. Assocs. v Lenox Hill Hosp., </em>38 NY2d 525; <em>Matter of Sipal Realty Corp. v Dankers, </em>8 NY2d 319; <em>Matter of Whitney Museum of Am.

The trial court lacked jurisdiction to order the Department of Housing Preservation and Development to issue a certificate of no harassment and erroneously applied the provisions of the Clinton Special District Zoning Resolution. III. The trial court erred in its interpretation of the provisions on economic hardship which are a prerequisite to obtaining a certificate of eviction based on demolition. <em>(Matter of New Year Realty Corp. v Herman, </em>11 AD2d 643; <em>Matter of Ansonia Residents Assn. v New York State Div. of Hous. &amp; Community Renewal, </em>75 NY2d 206.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b827-14\"><em>Victor A.

The order compelling the Department of Housing Preservation and Development to issue the no harassment certificate required by the zoning resolution impermissibly usurped the authority given exclusively to HPD by the City\u2019s zoning legislation. Moreover, the Supreme Court gave this relief to plaintiff even though it had not been requested in plaintiff\u2019s complaint and HPD had no notice that the court intended to address this issue. <em>(Flacke v Onondaga Landfill Sys., </em>69 NY2d 355; <em>Botwinick v Ogden, </em>59 NY2d 909; <em>Loretto v Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp., </em>58 NY2d 143; <em>Matter of Kamhi v Planning Bd., </em>59 NY2d 385; <em>Matter of Pelham Esplanade v Board of Trustees, </em>77 NY2d 66; <em>Matter of Lemir Realty Corp. v Larkin, </em>11 NY2d 20; <em>Matter of Darswan, Inc. v Capellini, </em>69 AD2d 835; <em>People ex rel.

III. The rent regulation statutes grant the Commissioner of DHCR exclusive jurisdiction to determine if harassment has occurred under these laws; the courts below improperly enjoined the harassment hearing pending before DHCR, granting relief that the owner specifically denied seeking, based on a trial that took place in a different action in which appellant was not even a party. <em>(State of New York v Barone, </em>74 NY2d 332; <em>Barasch v Barasch, </em>166 AD2d 399; <em>Schwartz v Public Adm\u2019r of County of Bronx, </em>24 NY2d 65; <em>Brown v City of New York, </em>60 NY2d 897; <em>Burrofato v Cretella, </em>108 Misc 2d 203; <em>Matter of Rainka v Whalen, </em>73 AD2d 731, 51 NY2d 973; <em>Matter of Doe v Axelrod, 71 </em>NY2d 484; <em>Matter of Block v Ambach, </em>73 NY2d 323; <em>Mass v Blum, </em>112 Misc 2d 898.)

The primary question presented by this appeal is whether the Supreme Court had concurrent authority to entertain the dispute in light of the various sections of the Regulations and the Code that specifically provide for the resolution of such disputes, at least in the first instance, by the Division of Housing and Community Renewal (DHCR), the administrative agency charged with implementing those statutes. We hold that DHCR had exclusive original jurisdiction in this situation and, accordingly, that plaintiff\u2019s complaint and petition should have been dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-8\">This landlord-tenant dispute has its origins in a three-alarm fire that occurred on March 8, 1986 in a 39-unit apartment building located at 306-310 West 51st Street in Manhattan. Most of the apartment units in the building, which was severely damaged in the fire, are subject to either rent-control or rent-stabilization laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-9\">As a result of the fire damage, the New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD) issued notices that the building contained violations of the Housing Maintenance Code. Additionally, the tenants, who had lived in the building from 8 to 45 years, brought an action in Civil Court to compel plaintiff, the building\u2019s owner, to make the repairs necessary to render their units habitable.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-10\">In response, plaintiff commenced an action in Supreme Court against the tenants and HPD for a declaration that under the applicable rent-control and rent-stabilization regulations he was entitled either to demolish the building or to remove the housing accommodations from the market because the cost to render them safely habitable was equal to or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>exceeded the building\u2019s assessed value <em>(see, </em>Administrative Code of City of New York \u00a7 26-408 [b] [3], [4], [5] [a]; 9 NYCRR 2204.8 [a] [1]; 2524.5 [a] [2]). In addition, plaintiff sought a declaration that he was entitled to be issued \"certificates of eviction,\u201d which the law requires as a condition precedent to an owner\u2019s regaining possession of rent-controlled premises in these circumstances <em>(see, </em>Administrative Code \u00a7 26-408 [a]). Finally, plaintiff sought permanent injunctive relief precluding HPD and the tenants from pursuing their efforts to force him to correct outstanding violations through administrative or Civil Court proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">Proceeding initially by order to show cause, plaintiff moved for a preliminary injunction against HPD\u2019s enforcement efforts and, alternatively, for an order consolidating his Supreme Court action with the pending Civil Court action brought by the tenants. Defendants opposed the motion and asserted, among other things, that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction of the controversy. The court denied plaintiff\u2019s requests for provisional relief and consolidation, but it did temporarily stay the Civil Court proceedings and set the controversy down for an immediate trial, thereby implicitly rejecting defendants\u2019 subject matter jurisdiction arguments. The Appellate Division revised the Supreme Court order in one minor respect and, as modified, affirmed without mention of the jurisdictional issue (125 AD2d 227).</p>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">The jurisdictional problem was again addressed when DHCR moved to intervene in the Supreme Court action for the limited purpose of raising that threshold issue. This time, the Supreme Court explicitly ruled on the issue, concluding that, as a court of unlimited equitable jurisdiction, it had concurrent authority to determine the dispute. The court also held that this was a proper case for it to exercise its concurrent authority because \"[f]rom past experience * * * if this matter was referred to DHCR, it would not be afforded the expeditious treatment necessary to protect the rights of the litigants.\u201d Accordingly, DHCR\u2019s motion was denied in an order that was subsequently affirmed (133 AD2d 1021).</p>\n<p id=\"b832-7\">While these preliminary matters were <em>sub judice, </em>DHCR was conducting a related investigation into the tenants\u2019 charges of landlord harassment (see, Administrative Code \u00a7 26-413 [b] [2]; \u00a7 26-412 [d]; \u00a7 26-516 [c]; <em>see also, </em>9 NYCRR 2526.2 [c] [2]; <em>id., </em>part 2206). To forestall administrative disposition of these charges, plaintiff moved within the declaratory judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>ment action for an order staying the agency\u2019s harassment proceeding. Plaintiff also commenced a separate CPLR article 78 proceeding against DHCR by order to show cause, seeking similar relief. The trial court granted the stay and also signed the order to show cause, which included an interim stay of the harassment proceeding.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court based its determination on its conclusion that the issues in the administrative harassment proceeding were factually related to those in the declaratory judgment action and that the waste of resources, coupled with the risk of inconsistent results, warranted the interim relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">Following a plenary trial of the factual and economic claims underlying the declaratory judgment action, Supreme Court found that plaintiff had satisfied the requirements of the rent-control and rent-stabilization provisions that permit an owner to recover possession of the housing accommodations where he has a good-faith intention promptly to demolish the building and construct a new one (Administrative Code \u00a7 26-408 [b] [4], [5]; 9 NYCRR 2524.5 [a] [2]). Specifically, plaintiff proved, to the court\u2019s satisfaction, that he had the \"financial capability] to accomplish his expressed * * * purpose of demolishing the building and constructing a new [one],\u201d that the mortgagee had no objection to plaintiff\u2019s plans, that plaintiff had provided the notifications required by local zoning regulations, that plaintiff\u2019s stated willingness to offer relocation allowances to evicted tenants appeared to comply with \"all applicable legal requirements,\u201d that the cost of removing existing violations would exceed or be substantially equal to the building\u2019s assessed value and that plaintiff\u2019s architect had prepared plans for submission to the Building Department for a new structure containing 40 apartment units, one more than the existing structure contained. Finally, the court found that plaintiff had satisfied the requirements of the Sound Housing Law (L 1974, ch 1022, as amended by L 1975, ch 360, codified at Administrative Code \u00a7 26-408 [b] [5]) by demonstrating that there was no \"reasonable possibility that [he could] make a net annual return of <em>[8l\u00e1%] </em>of the assessed value of the subject property\u201d and that he had not intentionally misman<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>aged the property in order to impair its ability to earn such a return.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-4\">Accordingly, the court held that, subject to his obtaining the necessary Building Department approvals <em>(see, </em>Administrative Code \u00a7 26-408 [b] [4] [d]; \u00a7 26-511 [c] [9]) and his formal offer of suitable relocation stipends to the tenants <em>(see, </em>9 NYCRR 2524.5 [c]), plaintiff was entitled (1) to be relieved of his statutory duty to give renewal leases to the rent-stabilization tenants, (2) to be issued certificates of eviction for the existing rent-control tenants, (3) to be issued no-harassment certificates by HPD under local zoning regulations for the Clinton Hill District and (4) to \"take any and all appropriate steps\u201d to evict the rent-control and rent-stabilization tenants. The court also granted plaintiff relief in the article 78 proceeding by permanently enjoining DHCR from taking further action against him in connection with the pending harassment charges. After consolidating the declaratory judgment action with the article 78 proceeding for the purpose of argument alone and after granting DHCR permission to intervene in the action, the Appellate Division affirmed each of these rulings. The court subsequently granted the unsuccessful appellants leave to take a further appeal, certifying the following question of law: \"Were the order and judgment of the Supreme Court, as affirmed by this Court, properly made?\u201d We now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">A building owner\u2019s right to evict tenants protected by the New York City rent control laws is governed by section 26-408 of the Administrative Code of the City of New York. Section 26-408 (a) lists seven grounds for evicting rent-control tenants \"for cause\u201d (Administrative Code \u00a7 26-408 [a] [1]-[7]), and section 26-408 (b) delineates the other circumstances in which owners of rent-controlled apartment units may regain possession, including situations where the owner has an \"immediate and compelling need [to recover the premises] for his or her own personal use\u201d or wishes to regain control of a unit that has been sublet <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 26-408 [b] [1], [2]). Also included in this category are situations in which the owner plans an immediate \"substantial\u201d renovation or complete demolition of the building <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 26-408 [b] [3], [4]).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">Where a section 26-408 (b) eviction is sought, the landlord must apply for and obtain a \"certificate of eviction,\u201d which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number><em>\"the city rent agency [now the DHCR</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em>] </em>shall issue * * * in accordance with its rules and regulations\u201d <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 26-408 [b] [emphasis supplied]). When the specific ground for eviction is the owner\u2019s \"good faith\u201d intention to demolish the building, a certificate cannot be issued unless \"[the] <em>agency </em>determines\u201d that the new building will contain a greater number of apartment units than the demolished building,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \"[the] agency determines that the issuance of such certificate is not inconsistent with the purpose\u201d of the rent control laws and the owner complies with the <em>agency\u2019s </em>regulations regarding relocating tenants and furnishing appropriate stipends for that purpose <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 26-408 [b] [4] [a]-[d]). The Sound Housing Law adopted in 1974 (L 1974, ch 1022) also requires a landlord seeking to withdraw a rent-controlled unit from the marketplace to satisfy the <em>agency </em>that \"there is no reasonable possibility that the landlord can make a net annual return of <em>[816%]\u201d (id., </em>\u00a726-408 [b] [5] [a]), and the landlord must obtain \"prior written approval\u201d <em>by the agency </em>if an existing tenant is to be evicted <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 26-408 [j] [1]).</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">The Rent Stabilization Code contains analogous rules requiring determinations by <em>DHCR </em>before a landlord may withdraw the protected apartment units from the market and demolish the building (9 NYCRR 2524.5 [a] [2]). Finally, both the New York City rent control law and the Rent Stabilization Code give <em>DHCR </em>the responsibility of adjudicating claimed violations of the rules prohibiting landlords from harassing tenants to induce them to leave their apartments (Administrative Code \u00a7 26-413 [b] [2]; \u00a7 26-412 [d]; \u00a7 26-516 [c]; see <em>also, </em>9 NYCRR 2526.2 [c] [2]; <em>id., </em>part 2206). The harassment question is one that must also be considered by <em>HPD, </em>under the Special Clinton District Provisions of the City Zoning Resolution (NY City Zoning Resolution \u00a7\u00a7 96-109, 96-110).</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">It is clear beyond question that the Legislature intended disputes over a landlord\u2019s right to demolish a regulated build<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>ing to be adjudicated by the DHCR and, to a lesser extent, HPD. The question presented here, which in this instance is dispositive, is whether by virtue of its constitutional role as a court of general original jurisdiction, the Supreme Court has concurrent authority to adjudicate such disputes.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">Article VI, \u00a7 7 of the NY Constitution establishes the Supreme Court as a court of \"general original jurisdiction in law and equity\u201d (NY Const, art VI, \u00a7 7 [a]). Under this grant of authority, the Supreme Court \"is competent to entertain all causes of action unless its jurisdiction has been specifically proscribed\u201d <em>(Thrasher v United States Liab. Ins. Co., </em>19 NY2d 159, 166), and to that extent its powers are \"unlimited and unqualified\u201d <em>(Kagen v Kagen, </em>21 NY2d 532, 537).</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">However, as all parties agree, rent-control and rent-stabilization disputes are a modern legislatively created category not encompassed within the traditional categories of actions at law and equity referred to in section 7 (a) of article VI of the NY Constitution <em>(see generally, Langerman v Langerman, </em>303 NY 465). Thus, the Supreme Court\u2019s authority in this case depends on the reach of section 7 (b) of article VI, which provides: \"If the legislature shall create new classes of fictions and proceedings, the supreme court shall have jurisdiction over such classes of actions and proceedings,\u201d even though \"the legislature may provide that another court or courts shall also have jurisdiction and that actions and proceedings of such classes may be originated in such other court or courts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b836-7\">It has been held that the \"new class of actions and proceedings\u201d to which article VI, \u00a7 7 (b) specifically refers are those which were unknown at common law and therefore would otherwise be outside the general jurisdiction continued and preserved by section 7 (a) <em>(Matter of Seitz v Drogheo, </em>21 NY2d 181; <em>Kagen v Kagen, </em>21 NY2d 532, 536-537, <em>supra). </em>However, it has never been suggested that every claim or dispute arising under a legislatively created scheme may be brought to the Supreme Court for original adjudication. To the contrary, in <em>Loretto v Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp. </em>(58 NY2d 143, 152-153), this Court observed that concurrent original jurisdiction is not necessarily conferred on the Supreme Court when the Legislature provides for the adjudication of regulatory disputes by an <em>administrative agency </em>within the executive branch, as distinguished from a court within the judicial branch. Indeed, we stated in <em>Loretto </em>that there is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>nothing in article VI, \u00a7 7 (b) or the relevant case law \"to suggest that administrative agencies cannot be given a first instance adjudicatory function, subject to judicial review\u201d (58 NY2d, at 153, <em>supra; cf., Flacke v Onondaga Landfill Sys., </em>69 NY2d 355, 362-363 [Supreme Court does not have jurisdiction concurrent with that of Department of Environmental Conservation with respect to agency\u2019s <em>legislative </em>licensing and regulatory functions]).</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">Accordingly, the constitutionally protected jurisdiction of the Supreme Court does not prohibit the Legislature from conferring exclusive original jurisdiction upon an agency in connection with the administration of a statutory regulatory program. In situations where the Legislature has made that choice, the Supreme Court\u2019s power is limited to article 78 review, except where the applicability or constitutionality of the regulatory statute, or other like questions, are in issue <em>(see, e.g., Seawall Assocs. v City of New York, </em>74 NY2d 92; <em>520 E. 81st St. Assocs. v Lenox Hill Hosp., </em>38 NY2d 525; <em>Niagara Falls Power Co. v Halpin, </em>267 App Div 236, <em>affd sub nom. Niagara Falls Power Co. v White, </em>292 NY 705).</p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">The only issues raised by plaintiffs complaint were his satisfaction of the regulatory conditions for obtaining certificates of eviction and demolishing a structure containing protected apartment units. The earlier described provisions of the rent-control and rent-stabilization laws demonstrate that the Legislature intended DHCR and HPD to be the <em>exclusive </em>initial arbiters of whether an owner has, in fact, met these regulatory conditions. In addition to the many references to the need to establish the necessary facts to <em>the agency\u2019s </em>satisfaction and the other references to determinations and findings by <em>the agency </em>(Administrative Code \u00a7 26-408 [b] [3], [4] [a] , [b], [d]; [5] [a], [b] [i]), the distinction drawn in the rent-control provisions between eviction proceedings that may be commenced immediately in court, without prior approval of the DHCR (Administrative Code \u00a7 26-408 [a]), and those that require agency-issued \"certificate[s] of eviction\u201d <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 26-408 [b] ) evinces a legislative intent to have issues arising in the latter class of cases determined, in the first instance, by the agency. Similarly, section 26-408 (f), which provides that orders granting a certificate of eviction \"shall be subject to judicial review only in the manner prescribed by [State enabling act \u00a7 1 (8) (codified at McKinney\u2019s Uncons Laws of NY \u00a7 8608) (mandating article 78 review)],\u201d lends further support to the conclusion that the agency was intended to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>exclusive original jurisdiction over these controversies. That conclusion is also bolstered by the Legislature\u2019s authorization to DHCR to continue the policies of its predecessor (the New York City Conciliation and Appeals Board) (L 1983, ch 403, \u00a7\u00a7 19, 20), including its practice of adjudicating landlords\u2019 applications for permission to demolish buildings subject to the rent-stabilization laws <em>(see, </em>former Code of Rent Stabilization Association of New York City, Inc. \u00a7 54 [D] [1]; <em>see also, </em>9 NYCRR 2524.5 [a] [2]).</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\"> Since concurrent Supreme Court jurisdiction was not contemplated in this situation and the Constitution does not require it <em>(see, Loretto v Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp., </em>58 NY2d 143, 152-153, <em>supra), </em>Supreme Court erred in entertaining plaintiff\u2019s claims on the merits. Furthermore, Supreme Court\u2019s consideration of the delays that purportedly typify the administrative adjudicative process was inappropriate, since that factor, to the extent it might ever be relevant at all, would apply only in the application of the doctrine of \"primary jurisdiction.\u201d That doctrine, which represents an effort to \"co-ordinate the relationship between courts and administrative agencies,\u201d generally enjoins courts having concurrent jurisdiction to refrain from adjudicating disputes within an administrative agency\u2019s authority, particularly where the agency\u2019s specialized experience and technical expertise is involved <em>(Capital Tel. Co. v Pattersonville Tel. Co., </em>56 NY2d 11, 22). While the rule is certainly not without exceptions, no such exception is possible where, as here, the agency\u2019s original jurisdiction is exclusive <em>(see, Flacke v Onondaga Landfill Sys., supra, </em>at 362).</p>\n<p id=\"b838-6\">For all of the foregoing reasons, the Supreme Court should not have entertained plaintiff\u2019s action for declaratory and related relief in connection with his efforts to demolish the building. Similarly, it should not have directed HPD to issue \"no harassment\u201d certificates on the basis of its own findings on the harassment issue or granted plaintiff\u2019s application in the article 78 proceeding to enjoin DHCR\u2019s inquiry into the tenants\u2019 harassment charges, since in these circumstances the harassment issue is one for DHCR and HPD to resolve under their respective enabling provisions. Finally, the Supreme Court\u2019s permanent injunction against the tenants\u2019 and HPD\u2019s efforts to remedy Housing Maintenance Code violations is untenable because it was premised on factual determinations that the Supreme Court had no authority to make. Rather than adjudicating the controversy, the Supreme Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>should have dismissed the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction <em>(see, Combustion Eng\u2019g v Travelers Indem. Co., </em>53 NY2d 875; <em>cf., Lanza v Wagner, </em>11 NY2d 317, 334; <em>see also, </em>3 Weinstein-Korn-Miller, NY Civ Prac \u00b6\u00b6 3001.13, 3001.18) and dismissed the article 78 petition on the merits because it sought to enjoin a determination that was within DHCR\u2019s exclusive province.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be reversed, with costs, the complaint and petition dismissed and the certified question answered in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">Chief Judge Wachtler and Judges Simons, Kaye, Alexander, Hancock, Jr., and Bellacosa concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-7\">Order reversed, etc.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b833-6\">. An earlier article 78 application by plaintiff for a writ of prohibition, a stay of the DHCR proceedings and consolidation with the pending declaratory judgment action had been denied by Justice Greenfield. Justice Pecora, who presided in the declaratory judgment action and the second article 78 proceeding, concluded that this determination was not a bar to his own issuance of the less \"drastic remedy\u201d of a discretionary interim stay.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b835-7\">. <em>See, </em>L 1983, ch 403, \u00a7\u00a7 22, 31.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b835-8\">. There is no minimum requirement for the number of additional units in the new structure if the landlord can show that \"the cost of removing [existing health and safety] violations would be substantially equal to or would exceed the assessed valuation of the structure\u201d (Administrative Code of City of New York \u00a7 26-408 [b] [4] [a]). In all other cases, the new building must contain at least 20% more unite. Other conditions for the issuance of a certificate of eviction for a planned demolition include the landlord\u2019s having obtained the necessary approvals for the new construction and a determination by DHCR that the certificate would not be \"inconsistent with the purposes\u201d of the rent-control laws <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 26-408 [b] [4] [d]).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
