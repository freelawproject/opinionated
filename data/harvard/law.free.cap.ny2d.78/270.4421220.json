The trial court\u2019s refusal to show defense counsel and appellant a jury note deprived appellant of his State and Federal constitutional rights to be present at all phases of his trial and violated the statutory mandate of CPL 310.10. <em>(United States v Ronder, </em>639 F2d 931; <em>People v Mehmedi, </em>69 NY2d 759; <em>People v Miller, </em>163 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>AD2d 491; <em>People v Carballo, </em>158 AD2d 701; <em>People v Mullen, </em>44 NY2d 1; <em>People v Ahmed, </em>66 NY2d 307; <em>People v Harris, </em>76 NY2d 810; <em>People v Coons, </em>75 NY2d 796; <em>Rogers v United States, </em>422 US 35; <em>People v Ciaccio, </em>47 NY2d 431.) II. The trial court\u2019s restriction of defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination of police witnesses was unduly prejudicial. <em>(People v Gonzalez, </em>131 AD2d 873; <em>Davis v Alaska, </em>415 US 308; <em>People v Bethune, </em>105 AD2d 262; <em>People v Kennedy, </em>70 AD2d 181; <em>People v Fogel, </em>97 AD2d 445; <em>People v Memminger, </em>126 AD2d 752; <em>People v Brinkworth, </em>112 AD2d 799, 66 NY2d 614; <em>People v Allen, </em>67 AD2d 558, 50 NY2d 898; <em>Alford v United States, </em>282 US 687.)

His appeal requires us to decide the extent to which the specific contents of jurors\u2019 notes must be disclosed to the defendant and defense counsel before a response is given. In the circumstances of this case, where the juror\u2019s note was substantive and referred to difficulties the jury was having in reaching a verdict, we hold that the trial court committed reversible error when it failed to disclose the note\u2019s contents before responding with an <em>Allen </em>charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">The incident leading to defendant\u2019s arrest began when the automobile defendant was driving hit another automobile that was traveling in the same direction. Defendant was arrested after the police officer who responded to the accident scene concluded from defendant\u2019s behavior that he was intoxicated. At the police station, defendant refused to take a breathalyzer test,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> but consented to participate in a number of performance tests designed to measure the degree to which his motor skills, balance and reflexes had been impaired.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-9\">The People\u2019s trial evidence consisted principally of the results of these performance tests, as well as the arresting officer\u2019s testimony about defendant\u2019s behavior at the accident scene and his postarrest refusal to take a breathalyzer test. The defense concentrated its efforts on impeaching the police officer\u2019s expertise and challenging the reliability of his conclusions as to defendant\u2019s sobriety. The defense also called a longtime acquaintance of defendant\u2019s family to the witness stand and elicited the fact that defendant had suffered severe back and leg injuries in a prior automobile accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-10\">After approximately five hours of deliberations and a re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>charge on the meaning of \"intoxication,\u201d the jury sent out a note informing the Judge that it was \"stalemated\u201d and wished to know \"how [to] proceed.\u201d The court responded by sending the jury to dinner and to a hotel for the night. On the following day, the jury deliberated at length and made several requests for evidence and instruction, but was still unable to reach a verdict. On the third day of deliberations, the court received another deadlock note in which the foreman stated \"I don\u2019t see us ever reaching a unanimous verdict.\u201d At that point, the court gave its first <em>Allen </em>charge <em>(see, Allen v United States, </em>164 US 492).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">Before the jury returned to resume deliberations, one of the jurors asked permission to speak to the Judge but was told to put his query in the form of a note. After receiving this juror\u2019s note, the Judge brought the jury and counsel back into the courtroom and had the note marked as a court exhibit. The Judge declined to read the note aloud, however, because, in his view, reading it \"would [not] serve any particular purpose * * * at this point.\u201d Instead, the Judge summarized the \"substance\u201d of the note\u2019s contents, stating that it \"indicates that there are continued disagreements among the jurors.\u201d After questioning five of the jurors and eliciting from four of them that a unanimous verdict was still possible, the Judge \"implor[ed]\u201d the jurors to try again and administered another <em>Allen </em>charge. When the jury was ushered out of the courtroom, the Judge elaborated upon his reasons for withholding the precise contents of the individual juror\u2019s note, stating that he did not read it because \"it indicate[d w]hat the present posture is as far as votes\u201d. Defense counsel then unsuccessfully sought disclosure of the note\u2019s contents.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>The jury deliberated for the remainder of the afternoon, returning to the courtroom for one more testimonial readback. At 5:08 p.m., the jury brought in its guilty verdict. Defendant was subsequently sentenced to a one-to-three-year term of imprisonment. He now appeals, by permission of a Judge of this Court, from an order of the Appellate Division, Second Department, which affirmed the judgment of conviction. The primary issue he raises on this appeal is whether the trial court\u2019s actions in relation to the individual juror\u2019s note constitute reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">We begin our analysis of this issue with CPL 310.30, which provides that a deliberating jury may request additional information or instruction \"with respect to any * * * matter pertinent to [its] consideration of the case.\u201d The statute further provides that \"[u]pan such a request, the court must direct that the jury be returned to the courtroom and, <em>after notice to both the people and counsel for the defendant </em>* * * must give such requested information or instruction as the court deems proper\u201d (emphasis supplied). CPL 310.30 thus imposes two separate duties on the court following a substantive juror inquiry: the duty to notify counsel and the duty to respond. It has been held that the latter duty requires the court to give a response that is \"meaningful\u201d <em>(see, e.g., People v Malloy, </em>55 NY2d 296, 301; <em>People v Gonzalez, </em>293 NY 259, 262). We have not, however, previously addressed the separate, albeit related, question raised in this appeal \u2014 i.e., the scope of the court\u2019s CPL 310.30 duty to provide counsel with \"notice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">The People have asked us to hold that the notice provision of the statute requires only that the court inform counsel of the existence of a juror inquiry and, perhaps, convey the inquiry\u2019s basic substance. Thus, the People argue, the court\u2019s obligation was satisfied here because counsel knew that a note had been sent out of the jury room and was advised that, in substance, it concerned the jurors\u2019 \"continuing] disagreements\u201d. We cannot agree, however, that the statutory mandate should be read so narrowly.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">The requirement that \"notice\u201d be given to counsel is not a mere formality or a procedural device designed only to ensure counsel\u2019s presence in the courtroom when the court gives its response to the jurors\u2019 request for information or instruction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number><em>(see generally, People v Ramsey, </em>40 AD2d 837, 838; <em>People v Merrill, </em>286 App Div 307). While that is undoubtedly one of the statute\u2019s purposes, an equally important purpose is to ensure that counsel has the opportunity to be heard <em>before </em>the response is given <em>(see, Rogers v United States, </em>422 US 35, 39; <em>United States v Ronder, </em>639 F2d 931, 934; <em>United States v Robinson, </em>560 F2d 507, 516 [en banc], <em>cert denied </em>435 US 905). Such an opportunity is essential to counsel\u2019s ability to represent the client\u2019s best interests and, further, to ensure the protection of the client\u2019s constitutional and statutory rights at these critical postsubmission proceedings <em>(see, People v Ciaccio, </em>47 NY2d 431, 436 [supplemental instructions, which are given in direct response to the jurors\u2019 own questions, \"may well be determinative of the outcome\u201d]). Thus, just as CPL 310.30\u2019s requirement that juror inquiries be answered mandates a \"meaningful\u201d response <em>(see, People v Malloy, supra, </em>at 301), so too does that statute\u2019s \"notice\u201d requirement mandate notice that is meaningful.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">We conclude that \"meaningful\u201d notice in this context means notice of the actual specific content of the jurors\u2019 request. Manifestly, counsel cannot participate effectively or adequately protect the defendant\u2019s rights if this specific information is not given. Indeed, the precise language and tone of the juror note may be critical to counsel\u2019s analysis of the situation in the jury room and ability to frame intelligent suggestions for the fairest and least prejudicial response. Concomitantly, the Trial Judge\u2019s summary of the \"substance\u201d of an inquiry cannot serve as a fair substitute for defense counsel\u2019s own perusal of the communication, since it is defense counsel who is best equipped and most motivated to evaluate the inquiry and the proper responses in light of the defendant\u2019s interests <em>(cf., People v Jones, </em>70 NY2d 547, 550; <em>People v Perez, </em>65 NY2d 154, 158).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">We further hold that, in most cases, this requirement of meaningful notice is best served by following the procedure that was outlined in <em>United States v Ronder </em>(639 F2d 931, 934, <em>supra; accord, People v Miller, </em>163 AD2d 491). Under this procedure, jurors\u2019 inquiries must generally be submitted in writing, since, as the trial court in this case recognized, written communications are the surest method for affording the court and counsel an adequate opportunity to confer. Further, whenever a substantive written jury communication is received by the Judge, it should be marked as a court exhibit and, before the jury is recalled to the courtroom, read <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>into the record in the presence of counsel. Such a step would ensure a clear and complete record, thereby facilitating adequate and fair appellate review. After the contents of the inquiry are placed on the record, counsel should be afforded a full opportunity to suggest appropriate responses. As the court noted in <em>Ronder (supra, </em>at 934), the trial court should ordinarily apprise counsel of the substance of the responsive instruction it intends to give so that counsel can seek whatever modifications are deemed appropriate <em>before </em>the jury is exposed to the potentially harmful information. Finally, when the jury is returned to the courtroom, the communication should be read in open court so that the individual jurors can correct any inaccuracies in the transcription of the inquiry and, in cases where the communication was sent by an individual juror, the rest of the jury panel can appreciate the purpose of the court\u2019s response and the context in which it is being made <em>(id.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">To be sure, there are special circumstances in which the foregoing procedures will need to be modified or tailored to ensure the integrity of the deliberative process. For example, there may be situations in which the contents of an individual juror\u2019s note cannot be shared with the rest of the jury because its substance is too personal or would exacerbate existing tensions. In such cases, alternatives such as redaction, paraphrasing and in camera colloquy may be considered <em>(see, United States v Ronder, supra, </em>at 934). In the final analysis, the choice of methods to be used to address particular idiosyncratic situations is a matter to be entrusted to the sound discretion of the trial courts, since it is impossible to predict or prescribe for the myriad of problems that may arise during the course of a jury\u2019s deliberations. The point of the <em>Ronder </em>decision and our own decision here is not to mandate adherence to a rigid set of procedures, but rather to delineate a set of guidelines calculated to maximize participation by counsel at a time when counsel\u2019s input is most meaningful, i.e., before the court gives its formal response. Accordingly, where there exist unique articulable circumstances that make the foregoing steps impractical, modified procedures that are equally conducive to participation by defense counsel are permissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">Viewed in light of these principles, the trial court\u2019s actions in this case were clearly inadequate. While the court initially acted properly by directing the individual juror who expressed difficulty to put his concerns in writing, the court\u2019s subsequent decision to withhold the contents of the juror\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>note fell outside the acceptable bounds of its discretion. A court can neither serve the goal of maximizing counsel\u2019s participation nor satisfy the CPL 310.30 requirement that meaningful notice be given when counsel is not afforded a verbatim account of a juror\u2019s communication and is thereby deprived of an advance opportunity to suggest a response. Indeed, given the importance of counsel\u2019s participation in this context <em>(see, Rogers v United States, supra), </em>it is difficult to imagine a situation in which a court would be justified in declining to show or read a juror\u2019s note to counsel. Certainly, a concern such as that expressed by the trial court in this case, i.e., that the note\u2019s contents might convey the status of the jury\u2019s deliberations, cannot furnish an acceptable justification for the complete exclusion of the defendant\u2019s attorney from the process of formulating a supplementary charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">Having concluded that the trial court\u2019s decision to withhold the contents of the juror\u2019s note in this case constituted error, we turn now to the question of whether that error presents a ground for reversal. As a threshold matter, we note that the court\u2019s error in failing to disclose the contents of the note had the effect of entirely preventing defense counsel from participating meaningfully in this critical stage of the trial and thus represented a significant departure from \" \u2019the organization of the court or the mode of proceedings prescribed by law\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v Coons, </em>75 NY2d 796, 797, quoting <em>People v Patterson, </em>39 NY2d 288, 295, <em>affd </em>432 US 197; <em>see, People v Mehmedi, </em>69 NY2d 759, 760; <em>People v Ahmed, </em>66 NY2d 307, 310). Accordingly, the error presents a \u2019\u2019question of law\u201d within the meaning of CPL 470.05 (2), notwithstanding that defense counsel did not object to the court\u2019s procedure until after the supplementary charge had been given.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">Similarly, we reject the People\u2019s argument that reversal is not required here because of the absence of specific prejudice <em>(see generally, People v Agosto, </em>73 NY2d 963, 966; <em>People v Lourido, </em>70 NY2d 428, 435; <em>People v Miller, </em>6 NY2d 152, 156). Manifestly, defendant was prejudiced by the court\u2019s actions, since the decision to withhold the contents of the juror\u2019s note deprived him of the opportunity to have input, through counsel or otherwise,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> into the court\u2019s response to an important, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>substantive juror inquiry. This case is thus distinguishable from <em>People v Agosto </em>(73 NY2d 963, <em>supra), </em>in which our Court found no prejudice, and therefore no cause for reversal, where a Trial Judge failed to respond to a juror inquiry, or even to notify defense counsel, before accepting the jury\u2019s verdict. This Court held in <em>Agosto </em>that, in view of the Judge\u2019s prior response pattern, his 20-minute delay in responding to the juror\u2019s note, which requested early dismissal for Sabbath observance, could not have been construed by the jurors as a tacit denial of that request and therefore could not have operated, even subtly, to pressure the jury into a premature verdict. Since there was no supplementary instruction given in <em>Agosto </em>and the absence of a response was not itself capable of creating a \"significant probability\u201d of prejudice, the exclusion of counsel from the Judge\u2019s decision-making process was also not prejudicial. The same certainly cannot be said where, as here, the trial court <em>did </em>respond to the juror\u2019s inquiry with a substantive <em>Allen </em>instruction that was, unquestionably, intended to have an effect on the deliberative process. In this context, the court\u2019s failure to notify counsel of the note\u2019s contents, which resulted in a denial of the right to participate in the charging decision, was inherently prejudicial <em>(cf., People v Jones, supra; People v Perez, supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">Inasmuch as there must be a new trial because of the court\u2019s error in handling the juror\u2019s inquiry, we need not comment on most of defendant\u2019s other claims of trial error. With respect to defendant\u2019s complaint about the trial court\u2019s denial of his pretrial motion to preclude evidence that he refused to take a breathalyzer test, we conclude that the ruling was not, as a matter of law, erroneous. The record supports the finding that defendant was afforded an adequate opportunity to consult with counsel <em>(see, People v Gursey, </em>22 NY2d 224, 229) and was accurately apprised of the consequences of his refusal to submit to the test <em>(see, </em>Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 1194 [2] [f]). When viewed in the context of defendant\u2019s statement to police that his attorney could not be contacted for several hours, the police officer\u2019s statement to him that his insistence on waiting for his attorney constituted a refusal was not misleading or inaccurate <em>(see, People v Gursey, supra). </em>Moreover, although the officer\u2019s additional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>statement that defendant\u2019s license would be revoked upon his refusal and would be restored only by order of a <em>court </em>was inaccurate <em>(see, </em>Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 1194 [2] [d] [1]; 15 NYCRR 136.1 <em>et seq. </em>[license to be restored only at discretion of Commissioner of Motor Vehicles]), the erroneous information was not material for these purposes and, consequently, could not have had an influence on defendant\u2019s decision to refuse. Thus, there was no impropriety in the use of defendant\u2019s refusal to take a breathalyzer test as part of the People\u2019s evidence-in-chief <em>(cf., People v Boone, </em>71 AD2d 859).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">Accordingly, for the reasons stated above, the order of the Appellate Division should be reversed and a new trial ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">Chief Judge Wachtler and Judges Simons, Kaye, Alexander, Hancock, Jr., and Bellacosa concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">Order reversed, etc.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b344-11\">. Defendant indicated that he would not submit to a breathalyzer test without first speaking with his attorney.
