The action was dismissed as untimely by the trial court and reinstated by the Appellate Division. This appeal requires us to determine whether the Statute of Limitations was tolled by the infancy of the sole distributee of decedent\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">In March 1987, Laura Morales \u2014 the decedent \u2014 was admitted to North Central Bronx Hospital, a facility owned and operated by defendant Health and Hospitals Corporation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Decedent died intestate on April 8, 1987, leaving her infant son as her sole distributee. Also surviving were several of decedent\u2019s siblings and her mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-7\">Letters of guardianship were issued to Margarita Colon, the infant\u2019s grandmother, on December 22, 1987. Upon issuance of the letters of guardianship, the guardian renounced her right to letters of administration and sought leave of court to have Magali Hernandez, decedent\u2019s niece, appointed administratrix of the estate. On December 31, 1987, the Surrogate issued limited letters of administration to Magali Hernandez, granting her authority to commence the present action.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-8\">In February 1988, plaintiff was granted leave to file a late notice of claim, and the present action was commenced on December 16, 1988. Thereafter, defendant moved to dismiss the claim as time-barred, asserting that the action was not commenced within one year and 90 days of death as required by McKinney\u2019s Unconsolidated Laws of NY \u00a7 7401 (2) (New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation Act \u00a7 20 [2] [L 1969, ch 1016, \u00a7 1]). Plaintiff responded that the limitations period was tolled during pendency of the motion for leave to file a late notice of claim and by the infancy of decedent\u2019s sole distributee. Supreme Court granted defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss, holding that pendency of the motion would have tolled the Statute of Limitations for only one month (from January to February 1988), and that the infancy toll was inapplicable because there were other distributees who could have promptly filed for letters of administration.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-9\">The Appellate Division modified, reinstating the complaint as to defendant. The court held that the Statute of Limitations on the wrongful death claim was tolled until the guard<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>ian was appointed; where the sole distributee is an infant, no one is eligible to receive letters of administration and bring a wrongful death action as personal representative of the estate until a guardian is appointed. Further, the court noted Supreme Court\u2019s error in concluding that there were other distributees as neither decedent\u2019s siblings nor her mother were entitled to share in the estate under the distribution scheme set out in the Estates, Powers and Trusts Law. Finally, the court overruled its own prior decision in <em>Cruz v Mount Sinai Hosp. </em>(61 AD2d 915) to the extent inconsistent with its holding in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">The Appellate Division granted leave to appeal, certifying the following question: \"Was the order of this Court, which modified the order of the Supreme Court, properly made?\u201d We now answer that question in the affirmative, concluding that the Statute of Limitations was tolled until the appointment of the infant\u2019s guardian.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-7\">Under the EPTL, plaintiffs have two years, measured from the date of death, in which to bring a wrongful death action (EPTL 5-4.1). At the time the present action was commenced, however, a one-year 90-day Statute of Limitations applied to actions brought against this municipal defendant (Unconsolidated Laws \u00a7 7401 [2]; <em>Brennan v City of New York, </em>59 NY2d 791).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Unless that limitations period was tolled, plaintiff\u2019s action \u2014 commenced one year and eight months after decedent\u2019s death \u2014 was not timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-8\">Under the CPLR, where the \"person entitled to commence an action is under a disability because of infancy * * * at the time the cause of action accrues\u201d the Statute of Limitations is tolled (CPLR 208).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The problem arises in the application of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>this toll to the wrongful death cause of action. The \"person entitled to commence\u201d a wrongful death action is not the decedent\u2019s distributee \u2014 who is the beneficiary of the claim\u2014 but the decedent\u2019s personal representative <em>(see, </em>EPTL 5-4.1). Is the infancy of the sole distributee a disability attributable to the \"person entitled to commence an action\u201d in the unusual situation where no personal representative can be appointed to bring a wrongful death action until the infant obtains a guardian?</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">Defendant argues that we answered that question in <em>Ratka v St. Francis Hosp. </em>(44 NY2d 604) and <em>Mossip v Clement &amp; Co. </em>(256 App Div 469, <em>affd </em>283 NY 554). However, neither case decided the issue before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">In both <em>Mossip </em>and <em>Ratka, </em>the decedents were survived by adult distributees. In <em>Ratka, </em>this Court affirmed an Appellate Division decision that held no infancy toll was available to the surviving child where there existed, at the time of decedent\u2019s death, next of kin who were under no disability to receive letters of administration (44 NY2d, at 608, <em>affg </em>54 AD2d 587).</p>\n<p id=\"b761-7\">The parties differ on the meaning of \"next of kin\u201d as used in <em>Ratka. </em>Plaintiff would limit those words to distributees; defendant would read them to include a decedent\u2019s relatives\u2014 here, for example, her mother, siblings and niece.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-8\"><em>Ratka, </em>like judicial opinions generally, should be read in light of its facts <em>(see, e.g., Crane v Bennett, </em>177 NY 106, 112) and limited to situations where \u2014 as in that case \u2014 there are other distributees who qualify for letters of administration. Indeed, the definition of \"distributee\u201d replaced that of \"next of kin\u201d in the relevant statute <em>(compare, </em>former Decedent Estate Law \u00a7 134 [\"next of kin\u201d defined as those entitled under the relevant distribution laws to share in the assets of the decedent], <em>with </em>EPTL 1-2.5 [defining \"distributees\u201d as those entitled to share in the property of a decedent under the governing distribution statutes]; <em>see also, </em>Rohan, Practice Commentary, McKinney\u2019s Cons Laws of NY, Book 17B, EPTL 1-2.5, at 14). Clearly, the Court in <em>Ratka </em>referred to the adult distributee when it noted that other \"next of kin\u201d were under no disability to receive letters of administration.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-9\">Nor is <em>Mossip </em>dispositive of the question we now confront. <em>Mossip </em>held that a \" 'right of action belongs to or is vested in the person or persons who has or have the lawful right to prosecute it.\u2019 \u201d (256 App Div, at 473, <em>supra, </em>quoting <em>Matter of Meng, </em>227 NY 264, 277.) It followed that no infancy toll could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>apply where the person entitled to bring the wrongful death action was the personal representative, not the infant distributee. However, in <em>Mossip </em>there was another eligible distributee, who had a right to letters of administration and thus the right to become personal representative. The rationale of <em>Mossip </em>does not control the present case, where no one had or could have had the \"lawful right to prosecute\u201d the action until a guardian was appointed for the person otherwise entitled to assume that role.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">The question before us thus remains an open one in this State.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">In resolving the question, we look first to the relevant statutory scheme. The wrongful death cause of action in New York is exclusively statutory, the first such statute having been enacted in 1847 (L 1847, ch 450; <em>see also, </em>NY Const, art I, \u00a7 16). We have no common-law cause of action for wrongful death <em>(see, Ratka v St. Francis Hosp., </em>44 NY2d 604, 612, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b762-8\">Under the wrongful death statute, a decedent\u2019s personal representative may maintain the action for the benefit of the distributees of the estate (EPTL 5-4.1; <em>see also, </em>5-4.4). \"Personal representative\u201d is defined as \"a person who has received letters to administer the estate of a decedent\u201d (EPTL 1-2.13).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-9\">Under the SCPA, distributees have a prior right to letters of administration (SCPA 1001); an infant, however, is ineligible to receive such letters (SCPA 707 [1] [a]). Thus, as the Appellate Division observed, \"where the sole distributee is an infant, no one is eligible to receive letters of administration until such time as a guardian is appointed.\u201d (169 AD2d 535, 536; <em>see also, </em>SCPA 1001 [2], [6].) It follows that in the present case, at the time of decedent\u2019s death, no one could be granted letters of administration \u2014 and consequently no one could com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>menee the wrongful death action \u2014 until a guardian was appointed for the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">The confluence of the pertinent EPTL, SCPA and CPLR provisions in this case thus gives rise to an unusual \u2014 perhaps unique \u2014 problem. EPTL 5-4.1 grants the personal representative procedural authority to bring the wrongful death claim; SCPA 1001 and 707 make it impossible for anyone to assume that role until a guardian is appointed for the infant sole distributee; and CPLR 208 speaks of tolling the Statute of Limitations when the person entitled to bring the action is under a disability at the time of accrual. In that a wrongful death action accrues at the time of death, mechanical application of CPLR 208 is impossible unless the position of the infant/sole distributee under the SCPA is ignored. We decline to reach that unnecessarily harsh result, and instead would construe the toll of CPLR 208 to apply until the earliest moment there is a personal representative or potential personal representative who can bring the action, whether by appointment of a guardian or majority of the distributee, whichever occurs first.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">What should not be lost in the maze of statutes is that the person \u2014 the only person \u2014 whose interests are at stake in bringing this action is decedent\u2019s child. Though a wrongful death action technically must be brought by the personal representative to ensure order in settling decedent\u2019s affairs, any damages recovered are \"exclusively for the benefit of the decedent\u2019s distributees\u201d; the cause of action is not part of and bears no legal relationship to decedent\u2019s estate (EPTL 5-4.4; <em>Hamilton v Erie R. R. Co., </em>219 NY 343, 350). The personal representative is a \"mere nominal party,\u201d acting in the capacity of trustee or agent for the beneficiaries <em>(Hamilton v Erie R. R. Co., supra, </em>at 351; <em>see also, Central N. Y. Coach Lines v Syracuse Herald Co., 277 </em>NY 110, 113-114). Damages are measured by the effect of the wrongful act on the distributees \u2014the pecuniary loss suffered by the individual distributees as a result of decedent\u2019s death <em>(see, George v Mt. Sinai Hosp., </em>47 NY2d 170, 176; <em>Matter of Meekin v Brooklyn Hgts. R. R. Co., </em>164 NY 145; EPTL 5-4.3; <em>compare, </em>EPTL 11-3.2 [action for injury to person of decedent belonging to decedent\u2019s estate]).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">Thus, in the present case it is decedent\u2019s infant child who has suffered any loss recognized by law, who is entitled to all proceeds of the action, and who will bear the full burden of dismissal of the claim. Moreover, as decedent\u2019s distributee, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>child would be in the group \u2014 indeed the sole member of the group \u2014 from which the personal representative would ordinarily be chosen.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">Given these circumstances, we conclude that the infant/sole distributee should have the benefit of the toll provided by CPLR 208. We note that other courts considering this issue have reached a similar conclusion <em>(see, Pulsifer v Olcott, </em>63 Misc 2d 524, <em>affd </em>41 AD2d 781; <em>Matter of Cruz v New York City Health &amp; Hosps. Corp., </em>131 Misc 2d 376; <em>see also, Stutz v Guardian Cab Co., </em>273 App Div 4 [applying military service toll to sole distributee]).</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">This result strikes the appropriate balance among competing policy considerations. On the one hand, Statutes of Limitation serve to bar stale claims, adding an element of certainty to human affairs <em>(see, Ratka v St. Francis Hosp., </em>44 NY2d, at 612, <em>supra; Flanagan v Mount Eden Gen. Hosp., </em>24 NY2d 427, 429). Against this important interest must be weighed the fairness of not unreasonably denying a claimant the right to assert a claim <em>(see, Caffaro v Trayna, </em>35 NY2d 245, 250; <em>see also, </em>Carlucci, <em>Time For a Change: The Infancy Toll and Wrongful Death Actions, </em>60 NY St BJ 18 [Apr. 1988]). Ultimately, what distinguishes this case and requires that the balance be weighed in claimant\u2019s favor is the infancy of the sole distributee.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-7\">We underscore that the Statute of Limitations is tolled only until appointment of a guardian or the majority of the sole distributee, whichever is earlier, when letters of administration may issue and a personal representative may assume the role of plaintiff. That is the first time there exists a potential personal representative entitled to \"commence an action\u201d <em>(see, </em>CPLR 208; SCPA 1001 [2], [6]). Establishing the earliest time for removal of the disability in the unusual situation presented accommodates both the interests of the infant and those of society in barring stale claims.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b765-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, with costs, and the certified question answered in the affirmative.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b759-10\">. The City of New York and several individual physicians were also named as defendants. Those parties have been dismissed from the suit and no appeal has been taken.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b760-9\">. That has since been changed. Effective August 24, 1990, a two-year Statute of Limitations applies to wrongful death claims against the Health and Hospitals Corporation (L 1990, ch 804, \u00a7 122).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b760-10\">. The two-year limitation is a limitation on the remedy, not the right <em>(see, Ratka v St. Francis Hosp., </em>44 NY2d 604, 611; <em>Sharrow v Inland Lines, </em>214 NY 101, 110). Therefore, although the statute creating the cause of action itself limits the time for bringing suit, it is treated as an ordinary Statute of Limitations \u2014 subject to any relevant tolling provision \u2014 rather than a condition precedent to suit <em>(see, Carrick v Central Gen. Hosp., </em>51 NY2d 242, 253, n 5; <em>see generally, </em>Siegel, NY Prac \u00a7 34, at 38 [Prac 2d ed]). The one-year 90-day Statute of Limitations is similarly subject to the tolls provided in CPLR article 2 <em>(see, Cohen v Pearl Riv. Union Free School Dist., </em>51 NY2d 256, 259).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b762-10\">. Courts elsewhere have considered the applicability of infancy tolls to wrongful death actions <em>(see generally, </em>Annotation, <em>Minority of Surviving Children as Tolling Limitation Period in State Wrongful Death Action, </em>85 ALR3d 162), reaching different conclusions <em>(compare, Haakanson v Wakefield Seafoods, </em>600 P2d 1087 [Alaska]; <em>Hun v Center Props., </em>63 Haw 273, 626 P2d 182 [applying infancy toll], <em>with Huntington v Samaritan Hosp., </em>101 Wash 2d 466, 680 P2d 58; <em>Wyatt v Spartan Mill Co., </em>287 SC 334, 338 SE2d 341 [refusing to apply the infancy toll]). In that the laws as well as the facts vary, these cases are of limited utility in our analysis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b764-8\"><em>. </em>Addressing the dissent, it is indeed a curious basis for criticism that a court would seek to avoid <em>unnecessarily </em>harsh results, especially in the present circumstances. Reading CPLR 208 in isolation, the dissent would dismiss the infant\u2019s claim because the representative is not under the disability of infancy. <em>What representative? </em>That the SCPA also controlled, precluding the possibility of there being a representative until appointment of a guardian, is virtually ignored by the dissent and precisely the source of the problem. The Court\u2019s solution \u2014 to apply the CPLR 208 toll until there is some person \"entitled to commence an action\u201d \u2014 is hardly remarkable where the claim is for the infant\u2019s sole benefit and but for his infancy he would otherwise be the representative.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b765-5\">Alexander, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AOT\">(dissenting). In order to avoid an \"unnecessarily harsh result,\u201d the majority today holds that in the \"unusual situation\u201d where an infant is the sole distributee of a decedent, the time within which the personal representative of the decedent\u2019s estate must commence a wrongful death action under EPTL 5-4.1 is tolled by CPLR 208 until a guardian is appointed for the infant, or until the infant distributee reaches majority, whichever occurs first. Because this interpretation constitutes nothing less than sheer judicial legislation, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">It is well established that the courts \"do not sit in review of the discretion of the Legislature or determine the expediency, wisdom, or propriety of its action on matters within its powers\u201d (McKinney\u2019s Cons Laws of NY, Book 1, Statutes \u00a7 73; <em>see also, Bronx Gas &amp; Elec. Co. v Public Serv. Commn., </em>190 App Div 13 [the courts should not, through any argument of necessity or hardship, arising either from a failure of the Legislature to act or from an unwise action on its part, assume the burden of legislation]). However, in its effort to rectify a perceived defect in the statutory scheme governing the prosecution of wrongful death actions, the majority has chosen to elevate a particular public policy concern over another equally important policy, as well as settled canons of statutory interpretation and stare decisis, justifying this judicial legislation on the basis of a distinction between the situation presented in this case and those in <em>Ratka v St. Francis Hosp. </em>(44 NY2d 604) and <em>Mossip v Clement &amp; Co. </em>(256 App Div 469, <em>affd </em>283 NY 554) that is both inconsequential and irrelevant to proper statutory analysis <em>(see, </em>McKinney\u2019s Cons Laws of NY, Book 1, Statutes \u00a7 72).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">While conceding that EPTL 5-4.1 vests the right of action for wrongful death exclusively and solely in the personal representative of a decedent\u2019s estate, the majority nonetheless concludes that because such an action is for the benefit of the decedent\u2019s distributees, where the sole distributee is an infant, the saving provision of CPLR 208 should be applied to toll the Statute of Limitations. This conclusion has absolutely no basis in the language of EPTL 5-4.1 or CPLR 208 and is inconsistent with long-standing precedent of this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-8\">EPTL 5-4.1 provides, in pertinent part, that <em>'[t]he personal </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number><em>representative * * </em>* may maintain an action to recover damages for a wrongful act, neglect or default which caused the decedent\u2019s death * * * Such an action must be commenced within two years after the decedent\u2019s death\u201d (emphasis added). CPLR 208 provides that <em>'[i]f a person entitled to commence an action </em>is under a disability because of infancy * * * at the time the cause of action accrues * * * [and] the time otherwise limited is less than three years, the time [within which the action must be commenced] shall be extended by the period of disability\u201d (emphasis added). The infant distributee in this case is not a person entitled to bring the action and therefore his disability cannot toll the Statute of Limitations in this wrongful death action.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">New York\u2019s wrongful death statute was first enacted in 1847 (L 1847, ch 450) and has been constitutionally guaranteed since 1894 <em>(see, </em>NY Const, art I, \u00a7 16, providing that \"[t]he right of action now existing to recover damages for injuries resulting in death, shall never be abrogated; and the amount recoverable shall not be subject to any statutory limitation\u201d). We have on several occasions expressly declined to adopt a common-law cause of action for wrongful death <em>(see, Carrick v Central Gen. Hosp., </em>51 NY2d 242, 249-250, n 2; <em>Liff v Schildkrout, </em>49 NY2d 622, 631-632; <em>Ratka v St. Francis Hosp., </em>44 NY2d 604, 610-612, <em>supra). </em>Indeed, the New York courts have consistently held that the right of action for wrongful death is purely statutory, and was unknown at common law <em>(see, e.g., Liff v Schildkrout, </em>49 NY2d 622, 631-632, <em>supra; George v Mt. Sinai Hosp., </em>47 NY2d 170, 176; <em>Ratka v St. Francis Hosp., </em>44 NY2d 604, 610-612, <em>supra; Caffaro v Trayna, </em>35 NY2d 245, 248; <em>Matter of Meng, </em>227 NY 264, 273; <em>cf., Neal v Butler Aviation Intl., </em>422 F Supp 850; <em>Barnette v Butler Aviation Intl., </em>89 Misc 2d 350). Therefore, the statute, which vests the right of action for wrongful death in the \"personal administrator\u201d of a decedent for the benefit of the distributees \u2014 not in the heirs or distributees personally <em>(see, Ratka v St. Francis Hosp., supra; Mossip v Clement &amp; Co., </em>283 NY 544, <em>supra; Matter of Meng, </em>227 NY 264, <em>supra), </em>is in derogation of the common law and should be strictly construed <em>(see, Matter of Robert Paul P., </em>63 NY2d 233, 238; McKinney\u2019s Cons Laws of NY, Book 1, Statutes \u00a7 301, at 459).</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">This Court has previously declined to extend the tolling provisions of CPLR 208 to wrongful death actions <em>(Ratka v St. Francis Hosp., supra; Mossip v Clement &amp; Co., supra). </em>In <em>Ratka </em>we affirmed the general principle earlier stated in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number><em>Mossip </em>that \"[t]he infancy of the decedent\u2019s children will not suspend the running of the * * * Statute of Limitations for commencement of a wrongful death action\u201d <em>(Ratka v St. Francis Hosp., supra, </em>at 611-612). In that case the decedent was survived by his wife, an adult daughter and six infants. More than two years passed during which neither the wife nor the daughter sought appointment as representative of the decedent\u2019s estate for purposes of bringing a wrongful death action. After the statutory period expired, one of the infants, having subsequently reached majority, was granted letters of administration and commenced a wrongful death action three years after the date of his father\u2019s death. This Court affirmed the Appellate Division\u2019s dismissal of the action as time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">The majority advances no principled reason for reaching a contrary result in this case. They contend that the critical distinction in <em>Ratka </em>and <em>Mossip, </em>which compels a different result here, is that in those cases other distributees were available at the time of decedent\u2019s death who were qualified and eligible to receive letters of administration and commence a wrongful death action. Here, however, the only person entitled to take the property of decedent at the time of her death was her 10-year-old son who, because of his infancy was not eligible to act as personal representative of the estate <em>(see, </em>EPTL 4-1.1 [a] [6]; SCPA 707 [1] [a]). Consequently, until the appointment of a guardian to represent his interest, no other person was available, qualified and eligible to be granted letters of administration <em>(see, </em>SCPA 1001 [1]). Thus, the argument goes, during the period between the date of death and the appointment of either the guardian or the administrator, the Statute of Limitations should be tolled as a result of the infancy of the sole distributee.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">Contrary to the majority\u2019s suggestion, our refusal to find the infancy toll of CPLR 208 applicable to the wrongful death actions in <em>Ratka </em>and <em>Mossip </em>did not rest upon the existence of other eligible and qualified distributees who could have been appointed as the personal administrator. Rather, the premise upon which we decided both of those cases was that expressed in <em>Mossip, </em>where we affirmed the general principle that the right of action for wrongful death \"is exclusively given and belongs to the representative,\u201d and therefore, unless the \"person entitled to bring an action\u201d is disabled, the tolling provision of CPLR 208 does not apply <em>(see, Mossip v Clement &amp; Co., </em>256 App Div 469, 473, 474, <em>affd </em>283 NY 554, <em>supra; see also, Ratka v St. Francis Hosp., supra, </em>at 612; <em>but see, Matter of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number><em>Cruz v New York City Health &amp; Hosps. Corp., </em>131 Misc 2d 376; <em>Barnette v Butler Aviation Intl., </em>89 Misc 2d 350, <em>supra; Pulsifer v Olcott, </em>63 Misc 2d 524, <em>affd </em>41 AD2d 781). Manifestly, the infant distributee is not a person entitled to bring the action <em>(see, </em>SCPA 707), and thus his disability cannot impact the running of the Statute of Limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">Moreover, even if the infancy toll of CPLR 208 were applicable in this instance, the majority\u2019s rule is inconsistent with and contradicts the clear mandate of that section; it prematurely terminates the effect of the toll upon the appointment of a guardian. CPLR 208 clearly states that where the toll applies \"the time [within which the action must be commenced] shall be extended <em>by the period of disability\u201d </em>(emphasis added). The plain language of the statute does not support the conclusion that the infancy toll applies <em>only </em>until \"the earliest moment there is a personal representative or potential personal representative\u201d (majority opn, at 693). Under CPLR 208 the Statute of Limitations is tolled throughout the infancy, and there is no authority for terminating it sooner. Thus, in <em>Ratka </em>we expressly rejected application of the toll because its application would undermine the effectiveness of the limitation period.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">Indeed, we have noted that Statutes of Limitation are \"statutes of repose\u201d representing \" 'a <em>legislative </em>judgment that * * * occasional hardship [resulting from not applying the tolling provisions] is outweighed by the advantage of barring stale claims\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ratka v St. Francis Hosp., supra, </em>at 612 [emphasis added]). Statutes of Limitation embody the important policy consideration of giving repose to human affairs <em>(Flanagan v Mount Eden Gen. Hosp., </em>24 NY2d 427, 429). As we held in <em>Flanagan (supra), </em>\"[t]he Statute of Limitations was enacted to afford protection to defendants against defending stale claims after a reasonable period of time had elapsed\u201d <em>(id., </em>at 429). Quoting <em>Riddlesbarger v Hartford Ins. Co. </em>(74 US 386, 390), we observed that Statutes of Limitation \" 'become statutes of repose, protecting parties from the prosecution of stale claims, when, by loss of evidence from death of some witnesses, and the imperfect recollection of others, or the destruction of documents, it might be impossible to establish the truth\u2019 \u201d <em>(Flanagan v Mount Eden Gen. Hosp., supra, </em>at 429-430).</p>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">To allow the infancy toll to operate here undermines the important policy considerations underlying Statutes of Limita<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>tian, because the wrongful death action in this case could be brought approximately 11 years after this decedent\u2019s death, and \"in instances where there are younger distributees, an even longer delay or tolling would be permissible\u201d <em>(Ratka v St. Francis Hosp., supra, </em>at 612). Although the Legislature, by providing the infancy toll, has recognized that certain circumstances outweigh the policies underlying applicable Statutes of Limitation, it is also accepted that such limitations often operate to bar justified as well as unjustified claims, \"heedless of whether or not the delay in bringing suit was justifiable or, indeed, could have been avoided at all\u201d <em>(see, </em>1 Weinstein-Korn-Miller, NY Civ Prac \u00b6 201.01, at 2-7). The majority concludes that the result it reaches \"strikes the appropriate balance among competing policy considerations.\u201d (Majority opn, at 694.) However, in so doing, the majority ignores the fact that the Legislature has already struck what it perceives to be the appropriate balance and expressly limited our powers in this area <em>(see, </em>CPLR 201 [\"No court shall extend the time limited by law for the commencement of an action\u201d]).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">I am no less sympathetic than the majority to the plight of infants who may be deprived of the proceeds of a meritorious and successful wrongful death claim by application of the time limitations set forth in EPTL 5-4.1, but any deficiency in this regard must be corrected by the Legislature, not the judiciary <em>(see, Liff v Schildkrout, </em>49 NY2d 622, 634, <em>supra). </em>Accordingly, I would reverse the order of the Appellate Division, and dismiss the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">Judges Simons, Hancock, Jr., and Bellacosa concur with Judge Kaye; Judge Alexander dissents and votes to reverse in separate opinion in which Chief Judge Wachtler and Judge Titone concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">Order affirmed, etc.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
