The defence was, surrender of the lease and payment. Upon the trial in March, 1862, before Mr. Justice James and a jury, a ver<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>diet was given for the plaintiff. Judgment was entered, and execution thereon was issued. A motion wag then made by the defendant to set aside the judgment and execution, on the ground that defendant was a married worgan when she hired the premises in question of the plaintiff, and still remained such; that she was not, therefore, personally liable for the rent, and that no action could be maintained or judgment given against her personally. The question of coverture was not raised at the trial, nor did the fact appear at any stage of the case prior to the motion. It was conceded that defendant\u2019s husband was, and for a long time had been, absent from this state. The opposing affidavits tended to show that defendant was keeping a boarding-house on her own account, and had occupied the plaintiff\u2019s said premises for that purpose.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b137-5\">Richard Busteed, <em>for the motion.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b137-6\">Edwards <em>&amp; </em>Odell, <em>opposed,</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AV\"><em>cited Code, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 144, 147-8; - 4 <em>E.
