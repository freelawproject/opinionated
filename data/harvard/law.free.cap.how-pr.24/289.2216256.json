The case was before Judge Barnard on. <em>habeas corpus, </em>and comes here for review on a <em>certiorari.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b293-11\">The statute declares that \u201c it shall not be lawful to sell or furnish any wine, beer, strong or spirituous liquors to any person in the auditorium or lobbies of such place of exhibition or performance mentioned in the first section of \u25a0= this act,\u201d &amp;c. <em>(Laws of </em>1862, <em>p. </em>416.)</p>\n<p id=\"b293-12\">The principle has been settled in substance, that \u201c beer,\u201d in statutes of this character and in such connection, must mean \u201c strong liquor, that is, strong enough with the inebriating principle or element, whether obtained by distillation or fermentation, to produce intoxication.\u201d <em>(Board of Excise </em>agt. <em>Taylor, </em>20 <em>N. Y. R., 173.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b293-13\">The warrant in this case charged the defendant with having sold \u201c lager bier.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b293-14\">It may be made to appear by proof, possibly, that \u201c lager bier\u201d is a kind of beer forbidden by the act. But that is not sufficient in a warrant, without other averments. The court cannot take judicial notice that \u201c lager bier\u201d belongs to the prohibited character or class. The warrant should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>charge an offence on its face'; what the court can see is an offence; should distinctly state the fact that showed the violation of the statute. It ivould have been sufficient to charge that the defendant had sold \u201c beer\u201d in the prohibited place, and then sustained that charge by proving the sale of lager bier, if lager be, from its properties, within the prohibition; or the warrant might have charged by averment, that lager was of that character of beer. But there is nothing now in the warrant that shows either by fact or averment, that \u201c lager bier\u201d is within the prohib\u00ed-\" tion of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">The order for defendant\u2019s discharge was therefore right, and is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
