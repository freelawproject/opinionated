This, however, is not the test.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-13\">If a person transfers his right of action to another, or if he authorizes another to sue for his benefit and on his behalf, or if he takes such proceedings in a court of justice, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>by which any officer of the law is authorized to sue for his benefit and on his behalf, he should be concluded by any legal action prosecuted in pursuance of those proceedings. In short, one is the privy of the other. The sense which the counsel for the plaintiff gives to the term \u201c privy,\u201d is too limited. The books mention five kinds of privies;\u2014 privies of blood, such as the heir to the ancestor; privies in representation, as executors or administrators to the deceased ; privies in estate between donor and donee, lessor and lesseej privies in respect of contract; and privies on account of estate and contract together. In this case, the receiver may be called the privy of the plaintiff by representation. He represents the interests of the plaintiff\u2019s estate, as far as the claim involved is concerned, as much as an executor or administrator represents the interests of a deceased person\u2019s estate. The authority to rea'lize these interests is transferred from the original possessor to the person representing him, as effectually in the one case as the other; and to allow one at whose solicitation a receiver is appointed, to prosecute a claim for which a judgment has been already obtained for his benefit and on his behalf, by the receiver, would be multiplying unnecessary litigation, and encouraging what the law has always discountenanced.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">The demurrer is overruled, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
