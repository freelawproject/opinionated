Horton, bearing date the 13th -day of December, 1855, by which the latter bound himself \u2022to build a saw-mill for the defendant on <em>his lands, </em>in the town of Roseboom, in a manner therein specified, and furnish all the materials therefor, and complete and have it ready \u201c for running, in a good workmanlike manner, by the 25th of August, 1856.\u201d The defendant was to pay Horton .$600 for building the mill and furnishing the materials\u2014 , $300 when the frame was up, and $300 on the 1st day of \u25a0November, 1856.. Horton and the defendant altered-said agreement in some respects, by writing under seal executed by them, bearing date the 2d day of July, 1856. Horton framed and raised the mill, and afterwards on the 17th day of July, 1856, entered into an agreement in writing, .under seal, with the plaintiff, whereby the plaintiff bound himself to Horton to go on and finish and fully complete said mill, ready and fit for business, so far as the carpenters\u2019 and mill-wright work was included, in a good workmanlike manner, on or before the 25th day of August, 1856, Horton agreeing to furnish all the materials for the same, for which Horton was bound to pay the plaintiff $110 on the 1st day of November in the same year, by passing over to the plaintiff an obligation in writing executed by the defendant for $110, payable on the first day of November aforesaid. On the 18th day of July, 1856, Horton and the' plaintiff, by a writing under seal, signed by them and dated that day, changed their said agreement, bearing date the previous day, so as to bind the plaintiff to furnish all the materials necessary for finishing the saw-mill and flume, and to cover the mill, except such as were then on hand, and' the castings named in Horton\u2019s contract with the defendant ; and in consideration thereof, Horton was to pay the plaintiff the further sum of $90, making $200 in all the plaintiff was to receive of Horton; and it was stipulated that the xvhole $200 should be paid by Horton to the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>tiff, by defendant\u2019s note payable the 1st day of November, 1856. The plaintiff commenced work upon the mill about the 17th day of July, 1856, under the contracts with Horton, bearing date July 17th and 18th of that year. He continued to work on the mill until about the 15th day of September, 1856, when it was ready to run, and the defendant commenced sawing in it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b312-5\">The plaintiff sought to recover in this action of the defendant for the work performed by him (plaintiff) in building the mill. He claimed that he did the work under a promise of the defendant to pay him. therefor; and that he had performed his contracts with Horton, and built the mill in accordance with the contracts between the defendant and Horton, except in some respects, of which the defendant approved.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b312-6\">The action was tried before a referee, who found that the plaintiff commenced work on the mill under the contracts he made with Horton of July 17th and. 18th, 1856; that \u201c after said commencement on the said mill, the plaintiff became fearful that Horton was not responsible for the. performance of the contracts aforesaid, on his (Horton\u2019s) part, which he communicated to defendant Weber\u201c that the defendant, to induce the plaintiff to go on and finish the mill according to the contract, did promise the plaintiff that if he would go on and finish the mill according to contract, he would see that plaintiff did not lose. anything by it. Also, that defendant told plaintiff that he would see that plaintiff got his pay, if plaintiff finished the mill according to contract,\u201d\u2014meaning the contract between the defendant and Horton, dated December 13, 1855, as altered on the 2d day of July, 1856 ; \u201c that plaintiff went on and finished the mill according to the contracts between said defendant and Horton, with the following exceptions, - viz: the said mill was not all inclosed; that some of the sheeting on the roof were more than one foot apart. There were no trap doors for saw-dust to pass down; the hinges <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>to the fall doors were not of sufficient strength and size to hold them; the main water wheel was from four to six inches higher than in the old mill; the carriage was not made long enough to saw a twenty-four foot log; that the mill was not completed by the 25th of August, 1856;\u201d \u201cthat the plaintiff and his hands quit work about the 15th day day of September, 1856, and did not after that work on said mill; that during the time plaintiff and his hands were at work, the defendant was often at the mill, and expressed his approbation of the work as it progressed up to the time Brown and his hands left the mill, except the single instance of the hinges to the fall doors. Also, that defendant about the time plaintiff and his hands left the mill, and after-wards, used the mill for sawing purposes;\u201d but that he used the mill pursuant to an understanding or agreement between him, Horton and the plaintiff, \u201c that it should not be regarded as an acceptance of the mill.\u201d The referee also found that there was affirmative evidence that plaintiff regarded his contracts with Horton as being in full force. The referee held that the plaintiff could not recover upon the defendant\u2019s promise that he would see that plaintiff had his pay for his work, or should lose nothing if he would go on and finish the mill according to contract, because such promise was void by the statute of frauds. The plaintiff and his hands boarded with defendant while they worked on the mill, under an agreement (as found by the referee) by which the plaintiff was to pay defendant therefor $2 per week for each person boarded; and for this board and some other account, the referee found the plaintiff was indebted to the defendant the sum of $49.66. Judgment was entered against the plaintiff for that sum with costs. The plaintiff\u2019s counsel took exceptions on the trial, and also excepted to the findings of the referee. The plaintiff appealed from the judgment to the general term of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b314-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>E.

The</author>\n<p id=\"AYl\">referee did not commit any error in the case, unless it was in holding that the plaintiff could not recover upon the promise of the defendant, to see the plaintiff did not lose anything or should get his pay, if he would go on and finish the mill according to the contracts between Horton and the defendant. After the plaintiff commenced working on the mill, he became fearful that Horton was not responsible for the performance of those contracts, and communicated that fact to the defendant. The defendant, \u201c to induce the plaintiff to go on and finish the mill according to those contracts,\u201d then made the promise to the plaintiff which I have mentioned. The referee held this promise was void by the statute of frauds, (2 <em>R. S., </em>135, <em>\\ </em>2, <em>sub. </em>2.) The controlling ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>tion in the case, therefore, is, whether this was a \u201c special promise to answer for the debt, default or miscarriage of another person.\u201d If it was such a promise, it was void, because it was not in writing. The plaintiff's counsel insists that the promise made was not collateral but original ; that the consideration for it was beneficial to the defendant, and therefore binding upon him. If the referee had found that the plaintiff abandoned his contracts with Horton, or refused to go on under them, and that thereupon the defendant promised him if he would go on and finish the mill, in the manner specified in the contracts between Horton and the defendant, he would see the plaintiff did not lose anything, or should be paid for his work, and that the plaintiff relying upon such promise did go on and complete the mill, the defendant would be bound to pay the plaintiff for all the work he performed subsequent to such promise. But the referee has not found that the plaintiff abandoned his contracts with Horton or refused to go on under them; and has found there was affirmative evidence that the plaintiff regarded those contracts as being in full force. It therefore seems to be very clear, if the plaintiff completed the mill so the defendant was satisfied it answered the contracts between him and Horton, he could have recovered of Horton the price he agreed to pay the plaintiff therefor. And it is equally clear that the promise of the defendant \u201c to see the plaintiff got his pay,\u201d or should not lose anything if he would go on and complete the mill, was collateral, and a special one to answer for the debt, default or miscarriage of Horton. The most that can be claimed on the part of the plaintiff, is that the promise of the defendant induced the plaintiff to go on and perform his contracts with Horton; and that the defendant assumed to be surety for Horton\u2019s performance of those contracts. The plaintiff was still in the employ of Horton, and was not at any time servant or employee of the defendant. Horton remained the principal debtor of the plaintiff. It follows <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>that the defendant is not liable on his promise, because it was not in writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">I have not thought it necessary to cite authorities to sustain any of the foregoing views, or deemed it profitable to comment upon any of the decisions relied upon by the counsel for either party. I will only say, I have examined all the authories cited upon the points of the counsel in the cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">The judgment in the action should be affirmed with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">Parker, J., concurred.
