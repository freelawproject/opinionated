On the return day of the order, if the security had not been previously filed, the motion for security was heard pursuant to the alternative of the order to show cause ; if the motion was granted, a peremptory order to file security was made. This order operated as a stay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>of proceedings. If security was not filed within a reasonable time pursuant to the peremptory order, a motion was made for judgment of <em>non pros., </em>or the party desiring security might apply in the first instance to the court on notice to the opposite party, in which event, if the motion was granted, a peremptory order to file security was made in the first instance. The proceeding in case of not filing security pursuant to the peremptory order was then by a motion for a <em>non pros.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">There is no enactment, either of the Code or otherwise, changing the practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">In this case the order is a chamber order, without notice, and is a peremptory order to file security, and in default thereof to show cause why the complaint should not be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">This motion cannot be granted without introducing a new course of practice. Motion denied, without prejudice to defendants making a further application for security in a different manner.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
