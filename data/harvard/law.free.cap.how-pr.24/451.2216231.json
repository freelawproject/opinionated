I .am not in favor of making out crimes by mere inference, and where the penalty imposed is, as in this case, a heavy one for offences of this kind, the court should require a clear expression of the intent of the legislature before they add to that penalty the liability of prosecution for a criminal offence.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">As the legislature in other parts of this act have declared the cases of violations of the act which they intended should be punished criminally, and have omitted any such declaration as to the acts prohibited in this section, the fair presumption is that they did not intend to apply to such acts any other punishment than the penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-8\">We concur with the recorder in his views on this question.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
