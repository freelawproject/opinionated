It was doubtful whether they had the power to impose the penalty of $50; but if they could render the proceedings in state courts invalid, they usurped a power that was illegal and unconstitutional. If they could impose a duty of six cents upon a summons, they could, upon the same principle, lay a duty which would amount to a prohibition, and thus paralyze the whole system of administering justice in the state tribunals.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b361-11\">Barnard, J., decided to dimiss the order.</author>\n<p id=\"A0oe\">Congress had' no right to interfere with the proceedings of the state courts. In his judgment, the provision was illegal and unconstitutional. Congress might impose a penalty, but could not invalidate the proceedings of the state courts; he would facilitate any appeal from his decision, upon a question of so much importance.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
