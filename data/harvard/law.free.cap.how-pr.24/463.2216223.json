Each member may also dispose of his interest in the partnership\u00bb property in good faith, and for a valid consideration, unless some creditor has acquired a lien thereon. The right of the creditor is subordinate to this power of the partner to make a <em>bona fide </em>disposition of \"the property until it is subjected to the creditor\u2019s lien. (3 <em>Kent\u2019s Com., </em>65, <em>and note; Story\u2019s Eq. J., </em>675, 1243, 1253; <em>Story on Partnerships, If </em>373, 402; <em>Gow on Partnerships, </em>275; <em>Ex parte Rowlandson, </em>1 <em>Rose R., </em>416, 419; <em>Greenwood </em>agt. <em>Brodhead, </em>8 <em>Barb.

Ch. R., </em>480; <em>Kirby </em>agt. <em>Schoonmaker, </em>3 <em>Barb. Ch. R., </em>46.)</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">In the present case Hunt transferred to Julia M. Chapman, all his interest in the partnership assets. ' There is no allegation that this transfer was fraudulent. No creditor had any lien to prevent it. Hunt has made no stipulation for the benefit of the creditors of the firm, requiring Julia to pay the partnership debts, and she came under no obligation to her partner Hunt to apply those assets to any particular purpose, or to indemnify him against the partnership liabilities. The creditors have no equities here to be worked out through the retiring partner. That partner reserved none for them or for himself. His disposition of the assets was absolute and complete, and Julia became vested with the entire and separate ownership thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">This property so transferred cannot be reached by execution on a judgment recovered against the firm composed of Hunt and Julia M. Chapman, where she has not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>been personally served with process. The property belongs to her individually, and the execution to be issued on such judgment must direct the sheriff not to levy on her separate property.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">It is quite clear that in such a case the remedy at law has not been exhausted as against Julia, and that creditors having judgments recovered by the service of process on Hunt only, with executions thereon, cannot maintain an action to inquire into or set aside any transfer made by her of such partnership property or assets as were conveyed to her by her former partner, Hunt, in the manner above mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">The order appealed from should be affirmed.</p>\n<author id=\"b469-7\">Ingraham, P. J.</author>\n<p id=\"At-_\">There can be no doubt that the judgment in this case would not be sufficient to warrant an execution against the defendant Chapman, who was not served, so as to reach her individual property.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">Nor would it form the foundation of an action against her if she had been sued upon it; that.would only furnish the amount of recovery after her liability was established by other evidence. <em>(Mervin </em>agt. <em>Kumbell, </em>23 <em>Wend., </em>293; <em>Oakley </em>agt. <em>Aspinwall, </em>4 <em>Comst., </em>513.)</p>\n<p id=\"b469-9\">Nor would it be a cause of action upon which an attachment against the debtor not served could be issued. <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b469-10\">In the <em>Commercial Bank, &amp;c. </em>agt. <em>Meach, (7 </em>Paige, 468,) the Chancellor held that, upon a joint judgment against several defendants, some of whom were -not served with process, all must be made defendants in a creditor\u2019s bill, to enable those whose property was taken to satisfy the debt to claim contribution against their co-defendants; and in <em>Howard </em>agt. <em>Sheldon, </em>(11 <em>Paige, </em>558,) he held that in an action on a judgment against joint debtors, where process was not served- on one defendant, but an execution issued against the joint property of all and the separate property of the one served, the creditor had not by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>such execution exhausted his remedy at law so as to entitle him to a creditor\u2019s bill against the defendant who was served with process in the last suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">In that case it was also held that the complainant had not exhausted his remedy at law for the recovery of his debt until execution had been issued against each of the defendants as to their individual property .as well as the joint property of the firm.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">This rule, applied to the present case, shows that the order appealed from was correct. <em>(See, also, Childs </em>agt. <em>Brace et al., </em>4 <em>Paige, </em>309.)</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">There is no force in the objection that the execution was returned before sixty days had expired! All the judges in this district have held that it was not necessary. The Chancellor also so held in <em>Platt </em>agt. <em>Cadwell, </em>(9 <em>Paige, </em>386.)</p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">Note.\u2014As there is considerable diversity of opinion in reference to this question, perhaps it may not be considered out of place, or improper, to-briefly review some of the decisions of the late court of chancery on this point. In this <em>same case </em>at special term, (22 <em>How. Pr. R., </em>329,) W. F. Allen, J*., said: \u201cHad the objection been urged that sixty days had not elapsed between the issuing of the executions upon the judgments at law and the commencement of these actions, I should have felt constrained to hold the objection well taken, following the decision at general term in the fifth district, and the construction given by the Chancellor to the statute regulating this equitable remedy.\u201d ( <em>Cassidy </em>agt. <em>Meacham, </em>3 <em>Paige, </em>311; <em>Strange </em>agt. <em>Longley, </em>3 <em>Barb. Ch., </em>650.)</p>\n<p id=\"b470-9\">In the case of <em>Platt </em>agt. <em>Cadwell, </em>(9 <em>Paige, </em>386,) the Chancellor said: <em>\u201c </em>This court does not inquire into the regularity of the proceedings of courts of co-ordinate jurisdiction. And the return of the executions in this case, even if they were liable to be set aside for irregularity by the court out of which they issued, were not void. The complainant, therefore, <em>after the return day was past, had a right to consider his remedy at law exhausted,'and </em>to filehis bill here to reach the effects of the defendant, which could not be levied on by the sheriff. And if the filing of the executions, with the return indorsed thereon, before the expiration of sixty days, was irregular, the defendant must apply to the court of law to set aside the returns. <em>(Williams </em>agt. Hogeboom, 8 <em>Paige, </em>469.) All that this court can do in such a case is to compel the complainant <em>to wait until after the return day of the execution is past </em>before he files his bill here. (<em>Cassidy </em>agt. <em>Meacham, </em>3 <em>Paige, </em>311.) And\" it will, when necessary, stay the proceedings here a sufficient length of time to give the defendant an opportunity to apply to the court of law for relief, where there is a probability that such relief will be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-10\">To the same effect is the case of <em>Williams </em>agt. <em>Hogeboom, supra, </em>where the execution was made returnable on a day certain, which was only five days after its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>teste; the Chancellor says: <em>cel </em>am satisfied that a neglect to make an execution returnable at the end of sixty days, from the receipt thereof by the sheriff, renders it irregular merely; and that the execution is not void, so as to make the attorney issuing it, and the party in whose favor it is issued, trespassers, without the necessity of an application to the court to set aside the execution for the irregularity.33</p>\n<p id=\"b471-11\">In <em>Cassidy </em>agt. <em>Meacham, </em>supra, the Chancellor said: eePerhaps a return made by the sheriff on an execution before the return day, may be valid by relation, after the expiration of the time the execution has to run. <em>Until the return </em>day, however, it would bo the duty of the sheriff to seize and sell any property of the defendants which could be found within his bailiwick. <em>The execution cannot&gt; </em>therefore, <em>be considered as legally returned unsatisfied until after the return day. </em>The creditor must, in his bill, set out the issuing of the execution, the time at which it was returnable, and the actual return of the sheriff thereon, in such a manner that the court can see that the remedy at law has been <em>legally </em>exhausted. The intention of the legislature was to adopt the principle settled by the court for the correction of errors in <em>Hadden </em>agt. Spader, (20 <em>John. R.} </em>554,) and not to establish an arbitrary rule, by which the defendant might he harassed by a suit in chancery when he had sufficient property which could be reached at law <em>during the life of the execution. </em>In the case under consideration the court cannot legally know, or presume, <em>previous to the return day of the </em>execution, that the judgment will not be satisfied. Although the sheriff cannot now find property, the defendants may, before that time, satisfy the execution out of the equitable funds in their hands, which cannot be levied on by him.33\u2014Rep.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
