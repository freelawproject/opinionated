Laws, </em>161, \u00a7 16,) which are carried into the Revised Statutes, (2 <em>R. S., </em>45, \u00a7 19, ls\u00ed <em>ed.,) </em>and were the law in 1846, when the constitution was adopted, and also refers to the provisions of the Revised' Statutes in the article relating to the voluntary dissolution of insolvent corporations, giving receivers the same powers conferred by law upon trustees of insolvent debtors, (2 <em>R. </em>(S'., 469, \u00a7\u00a768, 73,) including the power to compel references in any controversies which shall arise between them and creditors or debtors of the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">These references show that, as the law stood when the constitution was adopted, the persons representing insolvent debtors might, instead of bringing suits in court to settle controversies between themselves and the debtors of the insolvent, compel references of such controversies to referees, and that receivers of insolvent corporations might in the same manner compel references of controversies between themselves and the debtors of the corporations.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">The powers conferred on receivers by the act in question are very similar to those conferred on trustees of insolvent debtors, and receivers of insolvent corporations, by the Revised Statutes; and it may with truth be said, that in cases like this now before the court, the trial by jury had not \u201c been heretofore used \u201d azs the only mode of trial; but that trial by referees was also a mode of trial in use and authorized.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">An action involving the examination of a long account might be tried by a jury or by referees under the law as it existed at the adoption of the constitution. Hence, a reference in such cases is constitutional. <em>Lee </em>agt. <em>Tillotson, </em>(24 <em>W. R., </em>337,) Judge Cowen said in that case \u201cbut the seventh article (\u00a72) of our constitution declares that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>\u2018the trial by jury, in all cases in-which it has been heretofore used, shall remain inviolate forever,' and the case before us is supposed not to come within the exception. It is a satisfactory answer, however, that references as broad as that now contended for by the plaintiff were sanctioned by statute, and practiced by the courts long before the adoption of the constitution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">The same may be said in answer to the objection made to this statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">I am of the opinion that it is not in conflict with the constitution, and that the orders appealed from should be affirmed with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
