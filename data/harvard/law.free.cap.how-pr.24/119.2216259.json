The relator was one of the commissioners of excise of Cortland county. At the annual meeting of the board of supervisors of Cortland county, in 1860, he presented two bills to the board, for audit and allowance; one for $33, for eleven days\u2019 service\u2014ten days in meeting the board to grant licenses, and one day to make report to the board of supervisors; the other for $143.62, for forty-two days\u2019 service performed as such commissioner of excise, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>prosecutions for violations of the excise law, and $17.62 for disbursements incurred by him in such prosecutions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b124-5\">The board of supervisors audited the first bill at $30 for ten days only, and the second bill at $17.62 for disbursements only, and claimed that the relator was only entitled to pay as an excise commissioner for ten days\u2019 service in any one year, at $3 per day, besides the disbursements necessarily expended by virtue of his office. This mandamus was brought to compel the board of supervisors to audit and allow the balance of said bills. The alternative mandamus was directed to \u201c The Board of Supervisors of Cortland county,\u201d and was served upon their clerk only. Motion for a peremptory mandamus.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b124-6\">A. P.

And also, that at the same annual meeting, the relator presented to the defendants another account, in due form, and properly verified, for forty-two days\u2019 other' services by him as such commissioner, during said year, and $17.62 disbursements, and requested them to audit and allow the same at the sum of $126 for said services, and $17.62 for said disbursements, but that they refused so to do ; but did settle and allow the same at the sum of $17.62' for said disbursements, re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>fusing to allow anything for said forty-two days\u2019 services. That both the eleven days\u2019 service charged in the said first account, and the forty-two days\u2019 service charged in the said second account, were actually and necessarily performed by the relator as such commissioner of excise, and the said sum of $17.62 necessarily expended by him in the discharge of his duties as such commissioner, during the said year.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">To this writ the defendants return, that the relator did present his bill for services claimed to have been rendered as such commissioner, for eleven days\u2019 service, giving a copy of the bill, at $30, being for ten days\u2019 attendance of said relator at the board of commissioners of excise, as charged in said bill, disallowing $3 charged therein for one day making report to supervisors. Also, that the relator did afterwards, and during their session, present another bill, as set forth in the writ, (giving a copy of the bill in detail, consisting of services, from time to time, in attending justices\u2019 and other courts, traveling to get and serve subpoenas, and consult counsel, and attend to complaints, and settle with treasurer, and of expenditures in so traveling, and in and about various suits,) and that they allowed said bill at $17.62, for the disbursements charged therein, and that \u201c the residue was examined, considered, rejected and not allowed by the said board of supervisors.\u201d The return further proceeds to deny the performance of the services, and charges in the bill, except as allowed by them; and that the relator performed more than ten days\u2019 service, by virtue of any requirement of any law of this state, or that any part of the second bill is legally chargeable against the county of Cortland.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">The relator put in a plea to the return, reiterating the allegations of the writ above mentioned, and averring that no objection was made by defendants to either of said bills, except that defendants were not authorized to allow the relator for more than ten days\u2019 service, and that tho por<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>tions of the bills not allowed were rejected for the reason that in the opinion of the defendants the law only authorized them to audit and allow the relator\u2019s bill for ten days\u2019 service as such excise commissioner, and for no other reason; also alleging that the second bill was audited and allowed at $99.63, but subsequently reconsidered and allowed at $17.62, as above stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">To this plea the defendants put in a reply, admitting that the two bills were' audited and allowed at $30 and $17.62, respectively, and that the relator was one of the commissioners of excise of said county, and denying every other allegation in the plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">In connection with these pleadings, the parties submit a copy of the proceedings of the board of supervisors of Cortland county for the year 1860, in which appears the following: \u201c Mr. Kingman offered the following preamble and resolution, which were adopted : Whereas it appears that a bill of Samuel Plumb (one of the excise commissioners of Cortland county) has been audited by this board for $99.63, for services and disbursements, which bill is contrary to the express provisions of the statute, which says, that \u2018 in no case shall a greater compensation be allowed than three dollars ($3) per day, for ten days,\u2019 therefore resolved, that the said bill be referred back to this board for further action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">The bill was accordingly taken from the file and reviewed by the full board. \u201c Mr. Kingman moved that the said bill of Samuel Plumb be rejected. By consent, the vote on the resolution was laid over until to-morrow morning, at nine o\u2019clock.\u201d The minutes of the next day proceed : \u201c The board took up the business of reconsidering Samuel Plumb\u2019s bill, which had been laid over by consent to this hour. Mr. Spencer offered an amendment to Mr. King-man\u2019s resolution, previously offered, to reject the bill; that this board audit Mr. Plumb\u2019s bill at the sum of $17.63, that being the amount of his disbursements over and above his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>credits, as shown by his bill. The amendment was adopted. The question then recurred upon the original resolution as amended, which was adopted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">The case is thus brought before the court upon these pleadings and this evidence, at special term, and must be regarded as tried by the court upon waiver of a jury by the parties. As the case is presented upon the pleadings and evidence furnished by this extract from the proceedings of the defendants, I think it fairly appears that the portions of the bill rejected were disallowed on the ground that, in the opinion of the defendants, the statute prohibited their allowance; or, as stated in the resolution, the express provision of the statute is, that \u201cin no case shall a greater compensation be allowed than three dollars per day for ten days.\u201d Whether they were rejected on this ground or not, was a fact properly in issue, and, it seems to me, the only issuable fact of those put in issue by the pleadings in this proceeding. It is of no consequence here, whether the time charged for, was <em>actually </em>or <em>necessarily </em>spent by the relator in the services alleged, or not. If the defendants were not satisfied as to either of those facts, and rejected the charges for such reason, their decision was final, however the facts might be ; so that those facts cannot be inquired of here. But if the defendants rejected these items on the ground that the statute prohibited their allowance, that view precluded the <em>examination </em>contemplated by the statute under which the board of supervisors act in the settlement of accounts against their counties. That statute provides that boards of supervisors of each county in the state shall have power, &amp;c. \u201c to examine, settle and allow all accounts chargeable against such county.\u201d (1 <em>R. S., </em>367, \u00a7 4, <em>suh. </em>2, <em>1st </em>ed.) That is, in regard to accounts which are of <em>a kind </em>chargeable against their counties, they are to examine and decide whether they have been actually and properly incurred, and their decisions in these respects are final. (9 <em>Wend. R., </em>508; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>26 <em>Barb., </em>118; 2 <em>Sandf. S. C. R., </em>472; 21 <em>How., </em>117.) Their jurisdiction in regard to accounts is limited to such as are by law chargeable to their counties. If they allow accounts which are not legally so chargeable, their decision is not only not conclusive, but of no force or validity. <em>(People ex rel. Kelly </em>agt. <em>Haws, </em>21 <em>How., </em>117.) And on the other hand, if they decide that an account, which is legally chargeable against the county, is not so, and therefore reject it, their decision is of no binding force, and they may, notwithstanding, be compelled by mandamus to examine the account upon its merits, and reject or allow it, according to their judgment in that view of it. (Hall agt. <em>Supervisors of Oneida, </em>19 <em>J. R., </em>259.)</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">In the case last cited, the court say : \u201c The distinction recognized by us is, that when the inferior tribunal has a discretion, and proceeds to exercise it, we have no jurisdiction to control that discretion by <em>mandamus. </em>But if the subordinate public agents refuse to act, or to entertain the question for their discretion in cases where the law enjoins upon them to do the act required, it is our office to enforce obedience to the law by <em>mandamus, </em>in cases where no other legal remedy exists.\u201d And after showing that \u201c the question raised before the board of supervisors was not, whether the applicant claimed more than a reasonable compensation for his services, but whether the account was legally chargeable against the county,\u201d and that \u201c the supervisors denied that he had any legal claim which they were bound to audit and allow,\u201d the court proceeds to say : \u201c Now this shows clearly, that the supervisors did not entertain the question whether $30 or any other sum was a reasonable allowance for the services rendered. Th'at would have been a matter for their discretion, over which we exercise no control. The supervisors acted upon the principle that the applicant <em>had no legal claim. * </em>* If it be a legal claim, then we have no doubt of our jurisdiction to instruct and guide the supervisors in the execution of their duty, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>by <em>mandamusi </em>not to control their discretion in judging what is a reasonable compensation for such services, but to' compel them to admit the claim as a county charge, and to exercise their discretion as to the amount.\u201d This view is fortified by the case of <em>The King </em>agt. <em>The Justices of Kent, </em>(14 <em>East., </em>395,) in which Lord Ellenbobough said: \u201c If the justices had rejected the application in the exercise of the discretion vested in them by the legislature, the court would not interfere; but if they had rejected it on the ground now stated, <em>that they had no power to grant it, </em>the court would interfere so far as to set the jurisdiction of the magistrates in motion, by directing them to hear and determine upon the application.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">In the case at bar, as already stated, it appears that the defendants rejected the disallowed portions of the account on the ground <em>that they had no power to allow them. </em>If they might legally have allowed them, <em>they refused to entertain the question of their discretion; </em>so that the case is made to turn upon the question whether, as the defendants assumed, the commissioners of excise are limited in respect to the services which they are to perform and charge for to ten days. I do not think they are; but that the act plainly contemplates that they shall not only control the granting of licenses, but also that they shall bring suits for such of the penalties as are not specially required to be sued for by other persons. The limitation is expressly con- \u2022 fined to the time they shall spend in their meetings for the purpose of granting licenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">The 22d section requires that the penalties imposed by the act, except those provided for in sections 8, 15 and 19, shall be sued for and recovered <em>in the name </em>of the board of commissioners of excise. There is in the act no other provision made for the bringing of the suits contemplated by this section, except the one in section 30, which is as follows : \u201cIn case the parties or persons whose duties it is by the provisions of this act to prosecute, shall neglect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>to prosecute for any penalty provided by this act, for the period of ten days after complaint to them that any provision of this act has been violated, accompanied with reasonable proof of the same, any other person may prosecute therefor in the name of the board of commissioners of excise.\u201d From these two sections, constituting as they do all the provisions of the act in regard to the duty of prosecuting for the penalties contemplated by the 22d section, the necessary implication is, that the board of commissioners of excise are charged with that duty, and that where suits are to be brought <em>in their name, </em>they are to be . brought <em>by them, </em>except in the case provided for in the 30 th section. If they are to bring suits, they are to be entitled to receive $3 per day for the time necessarily spent in the performance of this duty, according to section 5, as well as for that spent in granting licenses. The provision of section 5 on this subject is as follows: \u201c N\u00f3 fee or reward shall be taken by any board of excise, or by any member thereof, for any license to keep an inn, tavern or hotel, or to sell strong or spiritous liquors, <em>or for any service required of such board; </em>nor shall any compensation be retained by any such board, or by any member thereof, or by any clerk thereof, out of the excise money, but the whole amount thereof shall be paid over to the county treasurers for the use of the -poor in the several counties ; but the persons composing such boards of excise shall be entitled each to receive the sum of three dollars per day for services actually performed, <em>to be allowed and paid in like manner as other county charges; </em>and no other or greater compensation shall be allowed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">I think, therefore, the relator is not tionfined in his right to charge <em>per diem </em>for services, to the ten days to which the board is restricted in the granting of licenses. It is the duty of the board to prosecute for penalties incurred, and the members of the board have the right to charge for the time spent in the performance of that duty ; and where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>they present their accounts to the board of supervisors, properly made out and verified, it is the \"duty of such board to receive and act upon them. If they refuse to do this, the authority of this court may be invoked to compel them.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">I think, therefore, the relator is entitled to a peremptory niandamus directing the defendants to examine the accounts <em>upon the merits. </em>But as was said by Lord Ellenborough, in <em>King </em>agt. <em>Justices of Kent, </em>(supra,) I \u201c do not, by granting this mandamus, at all interfere with the exercise of that discretion which the legislature meant to confide to the \u201d board of supervisors. I only say, that they have a discretion to exercise in deciding whether the relator has performed the services, and if so, whether the whole or any part of them ought to have been performed or ought to have been omitted, and consequently whether the account shall be allowed in whole or in part, or disallowed in whole or in part. To such effect must be the command of the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">I may here remark, that I do not agree with the defendants in the position taken by them, that the action does not lie against the <em>board of supervisors, </em>but should have been brought against the supervisors \u201cindividually, specifying in the process, pleadings and proceedings, their name of office,\u201d pursuant to 2 <em>R. S., </em>474, \u00a7 96, Is# <em>ed. </em>This is not an action against the \u201c officers named in the preceding 92d section,\u201d to which the provision of the 96th section refers. It is made the duty of the <em>board of supervisors </em>of each county to examine, settle and allow all accounts chargeable against the county, as above shown. And it is to compel a performance of this duty by the <em>board, </em>and not by the supervisors individually, that this action is brought. Hence it is properly brought against the <em>board.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">A peremptory mandamus must issue, commanding the defendants to examine the said accounts, with the view above stated. The relator is entitled to his costs of this action.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
