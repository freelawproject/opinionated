Whereupon, in April, 1860, the respondent\u2019s attorney served a notice on the attorneys of the appellant to file the return within ten days, &amp;c.; which notice was complied with. After the decision of the cause in the court of appeals, in April, 1861, affirming the judgment of the supreme court, and after the filing the remittitur, the respondent\u2019s attorney served the adverse attorneys with a bill of costs in the court of appeals, in which he charged $50, five term fees, three of which terms were notices of argument before the return was filed. The sum of $30, for these three terms, was stricken from the bill on taxation, and the respondent appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b93-8\">John Fitch, <em>for plaintiff and respondent.</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b93-9\">I.

The first two items in the bill were properly disallowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-8\">An appeal to the court of appeals is not properly or necessarily on the calendar till the return is filed. Until that is done, the court would not hear the case, and it could not be reached on the calendar till after the return is filed, because by rule 8 the date of filing of the return is the date of the issue. \u25a0 Rule 2 provides a remedy in case the appellent does not file his return, which is by motion to dismiss. This motion was not on the calendar. Unless a cause is in a situation to be heard when reached, it is neither necessarily nor properly on the calendar. Under the rule, a cause cannot be placed , on the calendar until the return is filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-9\">For all the terms at which this cause was noticed prior to the filing of the return, no term fees can be allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-10\">The bill as taxed must be reduced $30, charged for term fees prior to filing the return ; also $4 for error, in addition by taxing officer, 'of $10 and $15.
