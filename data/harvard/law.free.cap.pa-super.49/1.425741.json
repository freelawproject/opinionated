Walton, city controller. The case comes before the court on this petition and the return made thereto on July 18,1910.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b44-7\">The petitioners were duly appointed by the judges of the courts of oyer and terminer, and general jail delivery and quarter sessions of the peace, for the county of Philadelphia, as a Board of Managers of the House of Detention for the Reception of Untried Juvenile Offenders and Neglected and Dependent Children, under the age of sixteen, years, in the city of Philadelphia, under the provisions of the Act of assembly, approved July 2, 1901, P. L. 601. This act requires that in every city of the first and second class there shall be provided a House or Houses of Detention for the reception of the juvenile delinquents and dependents, described in the act, which shall be maintained by a board of five managers, two of whom shall be women, whose duties are described in the act. The fifth section of the act provides:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b44-8\">\u201cExpenses incurred in the performance of the said duties of the Board of Managers shall be itemized and presented with proper vouchers to the county commissioners of the county containing the city for which said Board of Managers may be appointed, who shall be required to pay the said expenses.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b44-9\">In the performance of their duties, the board, in the month of March, 1909, purchased from William Bryant forty-eight toils of coal, at a cost of $186.20, and in the months of March, June and July, from John Wanamaker <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>certain' furnishings for said House of Detention, at a cost of $508.85. It is not contended that these purchases were not necessary for the proper maintenance of the house and its inmates.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b45-5\">The board, in accordance with the requirements of sec. 5 of the act of 1901, presented itemized bills, with proper vouchers therefor, to the commissioners for the county of Philadelphia, who thereupon drew their warrants directed to the Philadelphia city treasurer, in favor of the said William Bryant and John Wanamaker, for the amount of their respective bills, and delivered these warrants to John M. Walton, controller of the city of Philadelphia, for his countersignature, according to law. It was admitted that at the time of the delivery of these warrants to the controller, respondent, there remained, and at the time of the answer filed, still remained unexpended a balance of appropriations made by the select and common councils of said city of Philadelphia to the said commissioners for the maintenance of the said House of Detention, more than sufficient to pay these two bills. Each of these bills was accompanied by a certificate of its correctness and of its approval by the relators, the Board of Managers of the House of Detention, as provided by law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b45-6\">The respondent, the controller of the city, whose duty, the relators aver, was to countersign the warrants for payment by the city treasurer, refused to countersign the warrants, or either of them, and thus \u201cprevented the relators from performing their duties under the act of 1901, and jeopardized the care and management of the House of Detention.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b45-7\">The respondent sets up, in justification of his refusal to attach his countersignature to the warrants, that the board did not present proper vouchers for the payment of the bills to the commissioners, in that:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b45-8\">1.

Ill, of the constitution of Pennsylvania, which provides:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b47-7\">\u201cNo bill .... shall be passed containing more than one subject, which shall be clearly expressed in its title.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b47-8\">The title to the said act of assembly being: \u201cAn act to establish in cities of the first and second class, a house or houses of detention for delinquent, dependent and neglected children, and providing for the management and maintenance thereof,\u201d while the body of the act provides that the cost incurred in the performance of the duties of the Board of Managers shall be paid by the commissioners of the county containing the city in which the House of Detention is established.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b48-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>(f) Averred that the act of assembly of July 2, 1901, is unconstitutional and void, in that it offends against art.

Although this judicial investigation is done within the limits of cities of the first and second class, it is not city work, but county work. The managers are \u2022 appointed by the judges of the courts of oyer and terminer, and general jail delivery, and the courts of quarter sessions of the peace, having jurisdiction in the said respective cities: Sec. 2, act of July 2, 1901.

W. Estlin v. Philadelphia, in which on April 19, 1904, a mandamus was issued against the city for $8,970.17, being the amount of a judgment on a case stated, that the councils have recognized the duty of the county commissioners, under the law, to provide the moneys needed for the erection of the House of Detention, as well as for its maintenance. In the Estlin case, the court held that under the Act of April 3,1903, P. L. 137, providing that the \u201ccounty commissioners in each county\u201d should provide a suitable building for the confinement of children awaiting trial, the county must pay for such property purchased by the city commissioners, thus holding them to be county officers. As it is common knowledge that the councils have provided all the moneys required for the maintenance of the House of Detention since the passage of the act of July 2, 1901, may we not assume that the county commissioners of the county containing the city have taken the necessary action to secure under the law the appropriation of such moneys, so that they could draw the warrants to pay the expenses of such maintenance, which they have drawn. This is not a case of the county commissioners levying a tax for the raising of the money to pay the expenses, but of drawing warrants for money already appropriated for the payment of the expenses of maintenance.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b52-3\">Section 13 of the Act of February 2, 1854, P.

Com., 102 Pa. 354.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b55-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>The Board of Managers of the House of Detention are performing not a municipal, but a county function in maintaining a place for the confinement of children awaiting trial in a court of justice.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b55-5\">At the argument it was stated, without contradiction, that the appropriations by councils to the city commissioners were made in lump sums \u201cto pay bills approved by the Board of Managers of the House of Detention on receipt of a certificate of said Board as to their correctness,\u201d and that no written contract or advertisement was required.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b55-6\">We must therefore conclude that the materials furnished for the maintenance of the house of detention, not being \u201cmaterials required by the city,\u201d and contracts made therefor not \u201crelating to city affairs,\u201d no advertisement nor written contract was required therefor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b55-7\">We will now consider the third question raised by the return of the respondent, viz.:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b55-8\">Is the act of July 2, 1901, under which the relators hold office, unconstitutional for the reasons advanced by the respondent?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b55-9\">1. The return sets out that the act is unconstitutional, because it violates sec. 3, art. Ill, of the constitution of Pennsylvania, which provides:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b55-10\">\u201cNo bill .... shall be passed containing more than one subject, which shall be clearly expressed in its title.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b55-11\">In Clearfield County v. Poor District, 135 Pa. 86 (89), it was held that an act entitled \u201cto organize the State Hospital for the Insane, at Danville, and provide for the government and management of the same\u201d did not violate the provisions in the constitution of 1838, providing that an act shall not contain more than one subject. The reasoning of that case is equally applicable here.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b55-12\">In Rose v. Beaver County, 204 Pa. 372, Beaver, J., in the Superior Court (which opinion the Supreme Court affirmed) said:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b55-13\">\u201c 1.. As to the title. In Com. v. Lloyd, 2 Pa. Superior Ct. 6, the subject of the sufficiency of the title of an act of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>assembly was very carefully considered and all our cases to that date carefully analyzed and, as a result, it was there stated that \u2018it is not necessary that the title of act should be a complete index of its contents.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b56-3\">\u201c \u2018If the title fairly gives notice of the subject of an act so as reasonably to lead to an inquiry into the body of the bill, it is all that is necessary.\u2019 The title of this bill is general, but it is not comprehensive. It does not descend to details, but no one interested in the general subject of the formation of poor districts, the purchase of lands and the erection of buildings, and the furnishing of relief, and giving employment to the destitute poor would not have such general notice as would lead him to make inquiry into the body of the bill. There is nothing in the bill which does not relate to the general subject outlined in the title\u00bb The opinion of Mr. Justice Mitchell, in Sugar Notch Borough, 192 Pa. 349, applies in many respects to all the questions raised in this case. It is there said:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b56-4\">\u2018\u201cIt must not be lost sight of that the attitude of courts is not one of hostility to acts where constitutionality is attacked. On the contrary, all the presumptions are in their favor, and courts are not to be astute in finding or sustaining objections.\u2019 The evil at which the constitution was aimed is thus stated with great clearness by the present chief justice in Road in Phoenixville, 109 Pa. 44: \u2018The design and scope of this constitutional amendment, adopted in 1864, are readily understood, when we consider the mischief which it was intended to remedy. Prior to that date the vicious practice had obtained of incorporating in one bill a variety of distinct and independent subjects of legislation. The real purpose of the bill was often, and sometimes intentionally disguised by a misleading title or covered by the all-comprehensive phrase \u201cand for other purposes,\u201d with which the title of many omnibus bills concluded. Members of legislature, as well as the general public, were thus misled or kept in ignorance as to the true character of proposed legislation. This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>being the evil intended to be remedied, the constitutional requirement as to the title is not to be strained to apply to cases not really within its reasonable intent.\u2019 See also Com. v. Gilligan, 195 Pa. 504.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b57-5\">We are of the opinion the title of this act is well within the principles there set out and does not violate the constitution. \u201cProviding for the management and maintenance thereof\u201d would surely call attention to the matter of expenses, and how they are to be provided.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b57-6\">2. The return sets forth that the act violates art. VII, sec. 3 of the constitution of Pennsylvania, but the reference is to art. Ill, sec. 7 in the respondent\u2019s counsel\u2019s brief. This provides:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b57-7\">\u201cThe General Assembly shall not pass any local or special law .... regulating the affairs of counties, cities,\u201d etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b57-8\">There are numerous authorities on this question, but the principles deducible are these:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"88\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b57-9\">\u25a0 A general law applies to the whole state, and affects all objects or all members of a class of objects to which it can appropriately apply. When it is said that a general law applies to the whole state, it is not meant that it must necessarily affect all parts of the State; but that no portion of the commonwealth shall be specifically excluded, and that the law shall apply wherever these objects may be found.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"89\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b57-10\">A local law applies to but a portion of the commonwealth; and a special law is one which affects some members of a class of objects, to the exclusion of others. Cities may be classified, and legislation applying to one class is general: Wheeler v. Philadelphia, 77 Pa. 338. This is so whether the subjects relate to municipal functions or not; that is, there are certain subjects which require peculiar regulations in large centers of population, and laws relating to subjects and applying only to cities of a certain class may be general \u2014 as a law regulating undertaking in cities of first, second and third classes \u2014 Com. v. Hanley, 15 Pa. Superior Ct. 271 \u2014 and one prohibiting the establish<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>ment of hospitals or pesthouses in built-up portions of the city: Com. v. Hospital, 198 Pa. 270.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"90\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b58-5\">The classification must be so made that the law will apply to others not members of the class at the time the law is passed, but which may in the course of time become members.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"91\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b58-6\">Not only cities, but counties and other political and municipal divisions may also be classified. In Lloyd v. Smith, 176 Pa. 213, Mr. Justice Mitchell said (218):</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"92\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b58-7\">\u201cBut even in regard to some of the prohibited subjects, such as the affairs of counties, cities, etc., it was very early found that there were such differences in situation, circumstances and requirements of the cities of the commonwealth, that classification with reference to their governmental machinery was of imperative necessity, and it was accordingly sustained, and the principle established that a law which does not exclude anyone from a class, and applies to all the members of the class equally, is general. The same principle must make classification constitutional as to the other political and municipal divisions of the state when considered in their governmental capacity. Classification of counties is therefore as permissible as classification of cities, and the legislature may determine what differences in situation, circumstances and needs, call for a difference of class, subject to supervision of the courts as the final interpreters of the constitution, to see that it is actually classification, and not special legislation under that guise. The presumption is always in favor of the legislative command, and it must prevail unless clearly transgressing the constitutional prohibition.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"93\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b58-8\">It would therefore seem to be clear that the confinement of children awaiting trial in a separate house of detention is a subject requiring peculiar regulation in large centers of population, as compared with rural or country districts, and further, that this act is not special or local, but general, within the principles laid down by the decisions under this section and article of the constitution.</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"94\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AA\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>March 1, 1912:</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"95\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b59-4\">\u201cThe averment of the return that one mandamus is improper here is without merit.

The contracts are both for materials furnished for the maintenance of the House of Detention. The only question is whether the city controller shall countersign warrants for such purposes. Both involve the same facts and the same provisions of the law, and his countersignature of warrants is the act to compel which this mandamus is issued.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"97\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b59-6\">It is ordered that a peremptory mandamus shall issue as prayed for by the relators.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"98\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b59-7\"><em>Error assigned </em>was the judgment of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"99\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b59-8\"><em>Robert Brannan, </em>with him <em>T.
