L. 551, authorizing courts to appoint viewers to vacate a road, does not fix any time when it can be done. If there is a public road in existence, even though it be obstructed, as this one is alleged to have been, proceedings can be commenced to vacate it, whenever any cause for which the act of assembly authorizes that commencement, exists, that is, whenever it has become useless, inconvenient or burdensome. Nor do we understand how it would benefit the exceptants if we were to sustain these exceptions for the reason given. If it was vacated by the act of the railroad company no harm can come to them by having viewers report what already had been done.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b536-5\">The authorities cited on this subject by the exceptants do not sustain their position. The Act of February 19, 1849, sec. 13, P. L. 79, authorizes a railroad company, whenever it is necessary in the construction of its road to change the site of a public road, to do so, but it must, at its own expense, construct a new one to take its place. In Phillips v. Dunkirk, etc., R. R. Co., 78 Pa. 177, it is decided that only when the new road is constructed, is the old one legally vacated. To the same effect see Penna. R. R. Co.\u2019s App., 128 Pa. 509. In Mellick v. Railroad Co., 203 Pa. 457, it is decided that if a railroad company obstructs an old public road before constructing a new one, it must show a clear necessity for doing so or it is a trespasser, and is liable in damages to anyone who suffers them by reason of not having the use of it. The taking possession of a road, therefore, is not a vacation of it, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>but a trespass. A vacation so as to deprive the public of a right in the old road is not complete until a new road is constructed. This is all that the cases cited by the ex-ceptants decide, and as no new road was constructed by the railroad company to take the place of the one occupied by its tracks, it was not vacated. But if it, from any cause, had become useless, inconvenient or burdensome, proceedings could be commenced to vacate it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b537-4\">The third exception is that the petition for the appointment of viewers was insufficient in that it sets forth \u201cThat by reason of the change of conditions in that vicinity said public road has become useless, inconvenient and burdensome to the inhabitants of said township,\u201d without stating what the changed conditions were, and that, therefore, the appointment of viewers was improvidently made.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b537-5\">The Act of June 13, 1836, sec. 18, P. L. 551, authorizes the appointment of viewers to vacate a road whenever the same shall \u201cbecome useless, inconvenient or burdensome.\u201d Section 23 of the same act provides that \u201cthe petition shall set forth in a clear and distinct manner, the situation and other circumstances of such road or highway, or of the part thereof which the applicants may desire to have vacated.\u201d Under this act the Superior Court has decided that it is sufficient if the petition set forth that the road has become useless, inconvenient and burdensome. In Keller\u2019s App., 5 Pa. Superior Ct. 222, it is said, \u201cThe grounds upon which the petition was based were in the usual form, that the road was useless, inconvenient and burdensome. This sets forth the general condition of the road with sufficient clearness, and the viewers having found this as a fact and that fact having been approved and their report confirmed by the court, we cannot consider the question of its correctness. The proceedings upon their face are regular, the requirements of the law have been fully met and the decree of the court below is therefore affirmed.\u201d This was followed in Manheim Township Road, 12 Pa. Superior Ct. 279, and in West Donegal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>Twp. Road, 21 Pa. Superior Ct. 620. This statement in the petition has been held to be sufficient by this court in Road in West Donegal Twp., 19 Lane. Law Rev. 293; Road in West Earl and Ephrata Twps., 21 Lane. Law Rev. 58, and Road in East Hempfield Twp. (No. 1), 21 Lane. Law Rev. 225.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b538-4\">In Sewickley Twp. Road, 23 Pa. Superior Ct. 170, where the viewers reported that the road \u201cis becoming useless and inconvenient on account of the construction of a coal tipple and railroad siding by the Penn Gas Coal Company,\u201d it was decided that the exception to the report should be sustained, because the court has no jurisdiction to vacate a road that'was becoming or was about to become useless, inconvenient and burdensome, but only where it actually is so. The report was not set aside because it appeared that a coal tipple and a railroad siding had been constructed upon it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b538-5\">The depositions in this case show that the changed conditions are the abandonment of the station, hotel and some dwellings at or near this road, and not in its occupation by the tracks of the railroad company. There is, therefore, no merit in this exception.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b538-6\">The sixth exception is that the report does not show what the changed conditions in the public road were to render it useless, inconvenient and burdensome. This is not necessary as we have explained in disposing of the third exception. The report does not show that the viewers found that the road has become useless, inconvenient and burdensome, and the deposition shows what the changed conditions are.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b538-7\"><em>Errors assigned </em>were (1-10) in dismissing exceptions to report of viewers.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b538-8\"><em>T.

The other assignments relate to questions of fact proper for the determination of the court of quarter sessions but not now before us as the writ of certiorari brings up the record only. We cannot go outside of that to consider matters of fact although they are discussed in the opinion of the court below: Hamilton St., 148 Pa. 640. The record is regular on its face and the argument of the appellant\u2019s counsel has not persuaded us that the proceeding was erroneously confirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-9\">The exceptions are overruled and the order affirmed at the cost of the appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
