Such a case is within the jurisdiction of a justice of the peace.</syllabus>\n<otherdate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b540-6\">Argued Nov. 16,1911.</otherdate>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ApdF\">Appeal, No. 61, Oct. T., 1911, by defendant, from judgment of C. P. Lancaster Co., Sept. T., 1910, No. 38, on verdict for plaintiff in case of Wayne Seldomridge v. Willis W. Gibble.</summary>\n<judges data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"Ad-L\">Before Rice, P. J., Henderson, Morrison, Orlady, Head, Beaver and Porter, JJ.</judges>\n<disposition data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"ASXo\">Affirmed.</disposition>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b540-7\">Appeal from judgment of justice of the peace. Before Landis, P. J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b540-8\">The facts are stated in the opinion of the Superior Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b540-9\">The court charged in part as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b540-10\">[It is undisputed, that Seldomridge put in this tobacco and did the work which was done on it up to the time of the cutting. The defendant says that, at that time, a good deal 'of it was not topped, and he and his men did this work. If the plaintiff did the work which he did do properly, and was willing to cut the tobacco at a proper time, and was prevented from doing so by Gibble, then Gibble has no right to complain and has no right to charge Seldomridge with the expense of the cutting. The same may be said as to the stripping and baling.] [1] But it was the duty of Seldomridge to perform his work in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>proper manner, as work of this kind is usually performed. Gibble had no right, arbitrarily, to tell him when to do the work, as he (Seldomridge) had a right to exercise a proper judgment just as well as Gibble had. If, however, Seldomridge delayed .unduly, and, because of his unskillful and unworkmanlike manner of taking care of the tobacco, loss would have been sustained by Gibble unless he had the work done, or the tobacco was deteriorating because the work was not done in proper time, then Seldomridge cannot complain because Gibble had the work done, and he is also accountable, under such circumstances, for the expense caused by his refusal properly to do the work.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b541-3\">In this case, there has been paid into court the sum of $25.00, and that is an admission, by Gibble, that there is that much due to Seldomridge. Therefore, your verdict in this case must be for that amount, and the question of costs is a question for the court hereafter. [Seldomridge, however, claims $83.81, and it will' be for the jury to ascertain just how much of this is due. If you find an amount to be due Seldomridge, you may add interest on it from about May 1, 1910.] [2]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b541-4\">Verdict and judgment for plaintiff for $48.75.

The crop was prepared for market and sold by the defendant for $115.47. This suit was brought to recover the plaintiff's share.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">The only question in dispute was in regard to the claim of defendant for certain money advanced and supplies furnished in protecting and marketing the crop. He admitted a liability of $25.00 and made a tender of that amount in court at the time of the trial. The exact amount to which each was entitled could not be known until the crop was marketed, and the share of each in the aggregate depended on the proper share of labor, material and money each contributed in performing their part of the contract. It was not in the nature of a claim for consequential damages of which a justice of the peace did not have jurisdiction, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>a plain calculation of expenses, and estimate of labor and market value of the crop in accordance with the agreement. The necessity for doing the work in the way and at the time it was done; the good faith of the parties in doing it; and the character and value of the crop all depended upon oral testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-3\">The whole controversy was submitted to a jury in a fair and adequate charge. The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
