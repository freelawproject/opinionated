The trial court ruled adversely to plaintiffs\u2019 claim for compensation \u201con the ground that the Fund has no authority to make the contract sued on in this case.\u201d Plaintiffs properly challenge the propriety of that ruling in view of the facts alleged and the law applicable thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-8\">From the second amended complaint, it appears that plaintiffs, as attorneys for the widow and three minor children of one E. E. Davis, who was killed in an industrial accident, brought an action for damages against the alleged negligent third parties. The State Compensation Insurance Fund, which was the insurance carrier for Davis \u2019 employer, paid the widow for herself and as guardian <em>ad litem </em>of the three minor children, the sum of $6,300 in pursuance of an award of the Industrial Accident Commission. The Fund claimed the right to recover said amount of death benefits \u201cas special damages against [the responsible] third parties, either in a separate suit brought in its own name, or by lien imposed on the judgment in any action brought by the widow on behalf of herself and the minor children.\u201d Electing to follow the latter course, the Fund entered into a written contract with plaintiffs for them to represent it in the death action and \u201cto recover the amount of its lien against any judgment obtained or amount paid in settlement of said case\u201d for a contingent fee of 25 per cent. As reason for their employment by the Fund, plaintiffs allege that \u201can action instituted in the Fund's name, as an insurer claiming subrogation, would be likely to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>encounter prejudice and hostility on the part of a jury, while an action prosecuted in the name of the widow on behalf of herself and of said minor children would be likely to excite a sympathetic consideration of all the evidence on the part of the jury\u201d; that \u201cat the time of negotiation of [said] contract . . . neither the widow nor the Fund knew of the existence of any insurance or property from which a judgment in excess of Five Thousand Dollars '($5,000.00) could be satisfied\u201d; that \u201cthe Fund was entitled to payment of Sixty-three Hundred Dollars ($6300.00) before any damages were payable to the widow, and in view of this priority no incentive existed for the widow to continue the prosecution of her action\u201d; that under the contract, an incentive for her attorneys, plaintiffs herein, existed to obtain a judgment and \u201cexplore the possibility of discovering additional assets' subject to execution, if [they] could look to the Fund as well as to [the] widow for a fee\u201d; and that through the services of her attorneys, \u201cperformed simultaneously and incidentally in the interest of the Fund,\u201d there would be \u201ca better prospect of obtaining damages on behalf of the Fund\u201d than would be the case if the Fund relied on \u201cthe services of attorneys in the civil service employ of [the] Fund.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b604-3\">It is then alleged that plaintiffs \u201cfully performed their part of [the] agreement and obtained judgment for, and actually collected . . . and caused to be paid to the Fund . . . Fifty-eight Hundred Dollars ($5800.00),\u201d of which amount \u201cplaintiffs [are] entitled to receive from the Fund the sum of Fourteen Hundred Fifty Dollars ($1450.00)\u201d under the terms of the contract; that \u201cthe services contracted for and performed by plaintiffs . . . were of such a nature that they could not be performed adequately or competently or satisfactorily by an attorney or attorneys selected under the provisions of the Civil Service Act of the State of California\u201d; that \u201cby reason of the selection and employment of plaintiffs by the Fund, it was possible for the Fund to obtain greater, speedier, more satisfactory and more adequate service than it could have obtained by use of any attorneys other than plaintiffs acting as attorneys for the widow and minor children in [the death] action\u201d; that at all times \u201cplaintiffs were actively in charge of the litigation\u201d and \u201cby reason of the investigation they had made, the preparation of pleadings by them, and their familiarity with the facts and the law pertaining to said litigation, and their concurrent representation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>of the widow and minor children in [the death] action, they were in a position to render adequate, competent, speedy and satisfactory service to the Fund and on the Fund\u2019s behalf\u201d; that as a result of plaintiffs\u2019 efforts the Fund was reimbursed to the extent above noted; that \u201cthe widow and minor children entered into an agreement approved by the Court to pay . . . plaintiffs ... a percentage of any amounts recovered over and above the amount of the lien of the Fund\u201d; that \u201cbecause of the facts and under the circumstances above alleged, the Fund could not be adequately represented by one of its attorneys selected under civil service, and consequently [it] employed the plaintiffs, as aforesaid\u201d; and that \u201cplaintiffs demanded . . . from the Fund\u201d their fee but it has been refused and still remains unpaid.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\">The pivotal question presented by this appeal from a judgment on demurrer is the sufficiency of plaintiffs\u2019 allegations to sustain their claim for compensation against the Fund. In support of the judgment, defendant Fund first argues that approval of its contract with plaintiffs would involve violation of article XXIV of the state Constitution, being the so-called Civil Service Amendment adopted in 1934. This argument accords with the view of the trial court that the Fund was without \u201cauthority\u201d to negotiate such independent,arrangements for legal services as were performed by plaintiffs. In this connection defendant relies upon the case of <em>State Compensation Insurance Fund </em>v. <em>Riley, </em>9 Cal.2d 126 [69 P.2d 985, 111 A.L.R. 1503], wherein the Fund entered into an agreement with a special attorney calling for him \u201cto act as attorney for [its secretary] Gallagher\u201d in the prosecution of certain federal tax litigation and \u201cto protect the fund\u201d in its correlative interest therein. After the agreement was made the State Controller refused to draw a warrant for the stipulated retainer fee. An action in mandamus ensued. In denying the writ, this court discussed at length the purport of the state civil service system as reflected by the history of the constitutional amendment above mentioned and the statutes enacted relating thereto. Without repeating that discussion, suffice it to say that the civil service provisions were expressly declared to be \u201ccomprehensive in their scope\u201d and \u201cto embrace within their terms professional as well as nonprofessional service\u201d performed for the state. Thus, while recognizing that the legal services there in question were \u201curgent, temporary and require [d] expert knowledge, experience and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>ability,\u201d this court significantly stated at pages 134-135 that it was \u201cnot alleged\u201d in the petition that the \u201cservices . . . involved could not be rendered by one selected under the provisions of the Civil Service Act.\u201d In line with this pertinent observation, this court continued at page 135:. \u201cThere undoubtedly is a field in which state agencies may enter into contracts with independent contractors. But the true test is not whether the person is an \u2018independent contractor \u2019 or an \u2018employee\u2019, but whether the services contracted for, whether temporary or permanent, are of such a nature that they could be performed by one selected under the provisions. of civil service. If the services could be so performed then in our opinion it is mandatory upon such appointing power to proceed in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution and statute above summarized. As already stated, <em>the petition does not allege that the services here involved could not he performed satisfactorily by an attorney selected under civil service. </em>The services contracted for are the services of an attorney. Attorneys are included within civil service, and in the absence of a showing to the contrary we must assume that such services could be adequately and competently performed by one selected in accordance with the mandate of the Constitution.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b606-3\">Plaintiffs\u2019 second amended complaint, as above reviewed, demonstrates their awareness of the exception noted in the Riley case as ground for removing the contract here in question \u201cfrom the operation of civil service.\u201d Thus, it is alleged that \u201cthe services contracted for and performed by plaintiffs . . . were of such a nature that they could not be performed adequately or competently or satisfactorily by an attorney or attorneys selected under the provisions of the Civil Service Act.\u201d The force of such allegation stems from the fact that in the conduct of its insurance business the Fund operates on a \u201cfairly competitive\u201d basis with private insurance carriers and has the power to \u201center into any contracts or obligations relating to the State Compensation Insurance Fund which are authorized or permitted by law.\u201d (Ins. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 11775, 11783.) So pertinent are these statutory provisions in measure of the Fund\u2019s rights here.  If the employer is insured against workmen\u2019s compensation liability, the insurer has the same right of action as the employer, or is subrogated to the employer\u2019s right. (Lab. Code, \u00a7 3850, subd. (b); Ins. Code, \u00a7 11662.) In enforcing its cause of action the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>insurer may (1) bring suit in its own name (Lab. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 3851, 3852) <em>; </em>(2) join as party plaintiff in the suit previously filed by the employee (Lab. Code, \u00a7 3853); or (3) abstain from suit and claim as a first lien against the entire amount of any judgment recovered by the employee, the amount of expenditures for compensation. (Lab. Code, \u00a7 3856.)</p>\n<p id=\"b607-4\">In the present case, according to the facts pleaded, the Fund elected the third course of procedure, the lien method of recovery in the death action, as best calculated to assure its recoupment of \u201cexpenditures for compensation.\u201d By that election, so it is alleged, the Fund avoided any prejudice which might accrue were it to appear before a jury as a party litigant seeking from \u201cthird parties\u201d a recovery to reimburse itself against an insurance loss. Moreover, in line with the allegation that the reimbursement claim of the Fund exceeded the amount of known assets from which a judgment against the responsible \u201cthird parties\u201d could be satisfied and the consequent priority right of the Fund in the damage recovery, the widow manifestly would have had no incentive to employ attorneys to prosecute the action for the sole benefit of the Fund and at the same time the Fund was without legal right to substitute in such litigation its attorneys or any other attorney selected by civil service examination in the place of the attorneys selected by the widow. But the Fund had a recognized <em>interest </em>in the death action by virtue of its claim of a lien upon any judgment that might be obtained therein and, <em>a fortiori, </em>it was to the Fund\u2019s advantage to have that action continued in pursuance of an approved means of effecting its reimbursement for \u201cexpenditures for compensation.\u201d (Lab. Code, \u00a7 3856.) Such claim of lien undoubtedly constituted an interest in the death action as would warrant the Fund\u2019s employment of special counsel for its protection, consistent with its broad powers to conduct its insurance business on a \u201cfairly competitive\u201d basis and to take such steps as it should deem proper to keep its losses at a minimum. (Cf. <em>State Compensation Insurance Fund </em>v. <em>Riley, supra, </em>9 Cal.2d 126, 131-132.) In so attempting to bring about a recovery in the pending litigation, the Fund was proceeding not on any theory of subrogation to the heirs\u2019 right to maintain their damage action <em>(Jacobsen </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. </em>Com., 212 Cal. 440, 446 [299 P. 66]) but on the premise of safeguarding its legitimate lien interest as created by statute. <em>(Merino </em>v. <em>Pacific Coast Borax </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number><em>Co., </em>124 Cal.App. 336, 344 [12 P.2d 458].) Thus, according to plaintiffs\u2019 pleading, the Fund contracted for them (1) \u201cto represent it\u201d in the death action as well as (2) \u201cto recover the amount of its lien against any judgment obtained or amount paid in settlement of said case.\u201d By such contract of employment, the Fund allegedly undertook to secure representation in litigation vital to the protection of its undisputed interest and to give it actual value. Likewise, in the exercise of its discretion with respect to the performance of its essential business functions, it allegedly deemed provision for plaintiffs, the attorneys for the widow, to share in the Fund\u2019s recovery to the extent of a contingent fee of 25 per cent would prove an incentive for the discovery of additional assets from which a judgment in the death action could be satisfied, and it elected to proceed on that basis as a matter of efficient handling of its lien claim. By reason of the unique set of facts alleged by plaintiffs, the services which they were required to, and did, perform in accordance with their contractual arrangements with the Fund involved considerably more than \u201cthe collection of a lien.\u201d Allegedly, as a matter of tactics and in recognition of certain practical considerations affecting its status with reference to the death action (cf. <em>Jacobsen </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com., supra, </em>212 Cal. 440, 446-447), the Fund negotiated its contract with plaintiffs in pursuance of one of the approved methods designed to keep its losses at a minimum by reason of compensation paid as part of its insurance business. (Lab. Code, \u00a7 3856.) Accordingly, the facts pleaded support plaintiffs\u2019 allegation that the particular services here in question \u201ccould not be performed adequately or competently or satisfactorily\u201d by attorneys selected under civil service; and such pleading is sufficient, on demurrer, to bring plaintiffs\u2019 case within the exception above noted in <em>State Compensation Insurance Fund </em>v. <em>Riley, supra, </em>9 Cal.2d 126, 135.)</p>\n<p id=\"b608-3\">Defendant next challenges \u201cthe ethics of employing the widow\u2019s attorneys to do the work of recovering the amount of the Fund\u2019s lien against her judgment.\u201d Such arrangement, it is argued, placed plaintiffs \u201cin the position of representing adverse interests\u201d and, as supporting authority, <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Eaton, </em>211 Cal. 113 [293 P. 788], is cited. But that case is wholly distinguishable upon its facts. There the plaintiff, suing for attorney\u2019s fees, had undertaken to represent defendant, the mother of a deceased employee, in an action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>against a third party tort feasor at a time when plaintiff was also acting as attorney for the insurance carrier in resisting defendant\u2019s claim against the insurance carrier before the Industrial Accident Commission. Plaintiff represented to defendant that the insurance carrier \u201cwould not contest her claim before the Industrial Accident Commission\u201d and \u201cadvised the defendant not to employ an attorney to represent her at the hearings before the Industrial Accident Commission,\u201d and \u201cnot to divulge that he was representing her in her claim\u201d against the third party tort feasor. Upon such representations and advice, defendant signed a contract employing plaintiff \u201con a one-third contingent fee basis\u201d to \u201cpress her claim\u201d against the third party tort feasor. Thereafter, and while under employment by both defendant and the insurance carrier, plaintiff appeared at the several hearings before the Industrial Accident Commission on behalf of the insurance carrier and \u201cwhile admitting liability, apparently contested or questioned defendant\u2019s claim as to the degree of dependency. As a result of these hearings, defendant received an award of $309, although plaintiff, prior to his employment by defendant, had approximated the claim against the employer to be worth $1500.\u201d With that factual situation before it, the trial court denied relief upon findings that the contract with defendant \u201chad been procured by fraud\u201d on the part of plaintiff, and \u201cthat it was against public policy and void. \u2019 \u2019 The judgment for defendant was affirmed. In so deciding, this court found it unnecessary to pass upon the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain the finding of fraud as it declared at page 116 that \u201cas found by the court below, the contract sued on is clearly against public policy and void.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b609-4\">While in its consideration of the <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Eaton </em>case, this court did refer to a possible conflict of interests in the event of an offer of settlement of the claims of defendant and the insurance carrier against the third party tort feasor, the decision was grounded upon the actual conflict of interests between defendant and the insurance carrier in the pending litigation before the Industrial Accident Commission. Thus, it was said at pages 116 and 117: \u201cWhile the defendant had knowledge that plaintiff was the legal representative of the insurance carrier of the Gas Company and received an annual retainer therefor, plaintiff failed to explain to her wherein the two employments were adverse. As attorney for the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>dant, plaintiff could, and probably did, secure confidential information concerning the degree of her dependency upon her deceased son. On the other hand, his representation of the Gas Company\u2019s compensation insurance carrier required him to contest defendant\u2019s claim before the Industrial Accident Commission, at least upon the issue of dependency. His dual employment thus placed him in a position to use this confidential information to the defendant\u2019s detriment. As already intimated, it is immaterial whether or not plaintiff, as counsel for the insurance carrier, actually availed himself before the commission of information received from the defendant while acting as her attorney. The impropriety of the dual employment is readily apparent.\u201d But the cited case does not hold that a contract of employment whereby an attorney undertakes to represent the dependent of a deceased employee in an action against a third party tort feasor, while also representing the compensation insurance carrier of the employer, is necessarily and under all circumstances against public policy and void.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-3\">In the present case, the litigation of the compensation claim had been entirely completed, the award had been paid, and plaintiffs had already brought the action on behalf of the widow before they entered into their contract with the Fund looking toward the recovery of its lien against any judgment obtained or settlement made. Plaintiffs\u2019 pleading shows that \u201cit was to the best advantage of all parties that one firm of attorneys should represent both the widow and minor children and the Fund, \u2019 \u2019 and that the widow and minor children entered into a written contingent fee contract with plaintiffs, with the approval of the court, after a full disclosure of the factors motivating plaintiffs \u2019 employment by the Fund. Plaintiffs\u2019 pleading does not show any actual or undisclosed adverse interests, or that any advantage was taken of any of the parties, or that plaintiffs were \u201crequired to choose between conflicting duties\u201d or \u201cto reconcile conflicting interests\u201d rather than \u201cenforce to their full extent\u201d the rights of all parties. <em>(Anderson </em>v. <em>Eaton, supra, </em>211 Cal. 113, 116.) Apparently the only possible conflict of interests between the widow and the Fund which could have arisen might have developed in the event of an offer of settlement, but such <em>mere possibility </em>does not necessarily invalidate plaintiffs\u2019 contract of employment. (Thornton on Attorneys at Law, vol. I, \u00a7\u00a7 174 et seq., pp. 307 et seq., and cases cited.) As was said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>in the cited text, section 176, page 314: \u201cThe question as to whether there is any inconsistency in representing particular interests must depend largely upon the facts presented by each case. \u2019 \u2019 Under the facts presented by plaintiffs \u2019 complaint here, we are satisfied that no such inconsistency appears and that the contract should not be declared to be against public policy and void.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-4\">Defendant finally raises the matter of plaintiffs\u2019 failure to allege that they had filed a claim with the State Board of Control pursuant to sections 667 and 688 of the Political Code; and contends, in reliance upon <em>Bekins Van &amp; Storage Co. </em>v. <em>State of California, </em>135 Cal.App. 738 [28 P.2d 61], that the filing of such claim by plaintiffs was a condition precedent before a court could acquire jurisdiction to entertain the cause for trial. But the cited case is not in point, for there the claim was \u201cagainst the state\u201d while here the claim is \u201cagainst the Fund,\u201d a \u201cself-supporting\u201d and independent \u201cagency of the state\u201d as declared by statute. (Cf. <em>Gilmore </em>v. <em>State Compensation Insurance Fund, </em>23 Cal. App.2d 325, 329-330 [73 P.2d 640].)</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">At the time this action was commenced, section 11783 of the Insurance Code provided that \u201c [T]he [Industrial Accident] commission may, on behalf of the fund and in the [fund\u2019s] name . . . sue and be sued in all actions arising out of any act or omission in connection with the fund, or in connection with its business or affairs.\u201d (Stats. 1935, ch. 145, p. 725: amended in 1945, Stats. 1945, ch. 1431, p. 2711, in a manner immaterial to this decision.) Section 11771 expressly precludes any liability against the state \u201cbeyond the assets of the [fund]\u201d for the payment of any such claim as is here involved. Section 11782 declares that \u201c [A]ll business and affairs of the fund shall be conducted in [its] name,\u201d and section 11774 provides that \u201c[its] assets . . . shall be applicable to the payment of losses sustained on account of insurance and to the payment of the salaries and other expenses charged against it.\u201d Section 11778 gives general authority to \u201c [T]he fund [to] transact workmen\u2019s compensation\u201d business \u201cto the same extent as any other insurer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">Sections 667 and 688 of the Political Code are general in their application to the presentation of claims against the state. The Workmen\u2019s Compensation law, the Insurance Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>and the Labor Code are special statutes. In <em>Brill </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles, </em>16 Cal.2d 726, 732 [108 P.2d 443], it was. held that <em>\u201ca </em>special statute dealing expressly with a particular subject controls and takes priority over a general statute.\u201d (See, also, <em>Birch </em>v. <em>County of Orange, </em>186 Cal. 736, 743-745 [200 P. 647].) In line with these observations, the conclusion is inescapable that the entire framework of the. Fund\u2014its organization, its powers, its duties, and its obligations\u2014shows that it was designed to be self-operating, and of a special and unique character; and as such, it may be sued, upon the claim here presented, without a previous filing of such claim with the State Board of Control.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-3\">From what has been said, it follows that the trial court erred in sustaining the demurrers to plaintiffs\u2019 second amended complaint without leave to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">Gibson, C. J., Shenk, J., Carter, J., Schauer, J., and Tray-nor, J., concurred.</p>\n<author id=\"b612-6\">EDMONDS, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AmLk\">In my opinion, assuming that plaintiff has pleaded sufficient facts to avoid, as against a demurrer, the bar of the Civil Service Act, the complaint does not state a cause of action because its allegations show that the contract sued upon is contrary to public policy and void.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">The attorneys plead, as the basis for the recovery of fees, that, at the time the contract was made, neither the widow of Davis, nor the Fund, knew of any assets of the tort feasor from which a judgment in excess of the lien for compensation could be satisfied. As further justification' for their employment, it is charged \u201c. . . that an action instituted in the Fund\u2019s name, as an insurer claiming subrogation, would' be likely to encounter prejudice and hostility on the part of a jury, while an action prosecuted in the name of the widow on behalf of said minor children would be likely to excite a sympathetic consideration of all the evidence on the part of the jury. ...\u201d In other words, the allegations of the complaint, in effect, are that the Fund is suing in the name of the widow.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-8\">At one time, the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act allowed subrogation, but since the amendment of 1927, \u201cin lieu thereof the employer is granted the right to sue or to acquire a lien for his expenditures in the event the employee sues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>and recovers judgment. . . . [Lab. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 3852, 3854, 3856.] The purpose of the change in the substantive rights of the employer and employee in such cases does not definitely appear. Counsel for the respondent corporation suggests that it was to remedy a certain abuse wherein subrogated employer plaintiffs had compromised eases for just enough to satisfy their claims and leave the employee without satisfaction of his just claim for additional damages.\u201d <em>(Jacobsen </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com., </em>212 Cal. 440, 446 [299 P. 66].) The effect of the majority opinion is to allow an insurance carrier, under the guise of \u201cprotecting its lien,\u201d to sue in the employee\u2019s name. By this simple device the door is again opened to the abuses mentioned in the Jacobsen case.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-4\">There is broad opportunity for taking advantage of an employee under the circumstances shown by the present record. Where an attorney is hired to represent both the insurance carrier and employee in the suit against the tort feasor, he may be required to choose between the conflicting interests of his two clients. If the suit goes to trial, the injured workman' may obtain a judgment for much more than the amount of compensation paid to him under the provisions of the Labor Code. There is also the possibility of an adverse judgment, in which event the insurance carrier would obtain no recovery for compensation by it. Counsel \u201cthough in good faith intending to discharge his obligation as . . . [the injured party\u2019s] attorney, would be in such a position as might have unconsciously caused him to accept an offer of compromise or settlement of her claim . . . rather than run the risk of bringing an action and jeopardizing\u201d the carrier\u2019s rights. <em>(Anderson </em>v. <em>Eaton, </em>211 Cal. 113, 117 [293 P. 788]. Cf. <em>Lessing </em>v. <em>Gibbons, </em>6 Cal.App.2d 598 at 604 [45 P.2d 258].)</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">In <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Eaton, supra, </em>as in the present case, the widow of the deceased employee was represented by counsel also employed by the carrier. She had full knowledge of his dual employment. After she discharged him and settled with the tort feasor, the attorney sued her for his fee. The court held that the contract was void as against public policy because of the conflict of interest between the two clients. Although in that case there was evidence as to fraudulent representations by the attorney and here the plaintiffs\u2019 good faith is not questioned, the ruling does not rest upon the ground of the representations of the attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>The distinction, made in the majority opinion overlooks the vice inherent in such contracts. Although in the representation of more than one party who may benefit by the litigation, an attorney may not be called upon to choose between the interests of one of them in preference to that of another, public policy bars him from serving persons whose interests may at any time become adverse. \u201cBy virtue of this rule,\u201d it was said in the Anderson case, \u201can attorney is precluded from assuming any relation which would prevent him from devoting his entire energies to his client\u2019s interests. Nor does it matter that the intention and motives of the attorney are honest. The rule is designed not alone to prevent the dishonest practitioner from fraudulent conduct, but as well to preclude the honest practitioner from putting himself in a position where he may be required to choose between conflicting duties, or be led to an attempt to reconcile conflicting interests, rather than to enforce to their full extent the rights of the interest which he should alone represent. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b614-3\">The facts pleaded in the present case show a cause of action based upon a contract which public policy forbids. A fundamental rule of the legal profession is that \u201ca lawyer can, under no conceivable circumstances, recover for services rendered in the same suit to parties having opposing interests.\u201d <em>(Strong </em>v. <em>International Bldg., Loan &amp; Investment Union, </em>183 Ill. 97,102 [55 N.E. 675, 47 L.R.A. 792].)</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">For these reasons, I would affirm the judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
