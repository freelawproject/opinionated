Appellant asks the Court to consider:</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">I. Whether the appellee\u2019s claims for defamation and malicious prosecution were barred by a release which appellee executed pursuant to Md.Ann.Code, Art. 27 \u00a7 737 (1987), \u201cExpungement of Police and Court Records.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">II. Whether the damages awarded by the jury are duplicitous.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-8\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b744-9\">In January 1985 Michael Pantazes (Michael) was contacted by an employee of the Budget Rent-A-Car Company (Budget) who demanded payment for damage which Michael had allegedly inflicted on one of Budget\u2019s cars. The employee told Michael that Dean Pantazes (Dean) had informed Budget that Michael was the one who damaged the car. Later, in February 1985, Michael was summonsed by the Sheriff\u2019s Department for Prince George\u2019s County and served with a statement of charges which alleged that he \u201cdid willfully and maliciously destroy, injure and molest the right side of 1985 Lincoln the property of Budget Rent-A-Car.\u201d Attached thereto was an \u201cApplication for Statement of Charges\u201d, signed by one of Budget\u2019s employees, alleging that Dean saw Michael scratch the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-10\">When Michael appeared in the District Court on March 8, 1985, the criminal charges against him were dismissed by the State. Shortly thereafter, Michael filed a \u201cPetition for Expungement of Records\u201d pursuant to Md.Ann.Code, Art. 27 \u00a7 737 <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which included, in accordance with the statute, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>the following: <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-5\">GENERAL WAIVER AND RELEASE</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-6\">I, Michael Pantazes, hereby release and forever discharge the Montgomery County Police Department, all of its officers, agents and employees and any and all other persons from any and all claims which I may have for wrongful conduct by reason of my arrest, detention or confinement on or about January 23, 1985.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-7\">This General Waiver and Release is conditioned on the expungement of the record of my arrest, detention, or confinement and compliance with Section 736(c) of Article 27 of the Annotated Code of Maryland, and shall be void if these conditions are not met.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-8\">[Dated] 14 March 1985</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-9\">[Signed] Michael Pantazes</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b745-10\">As a result, and in compliance with Md.Ann.Code, Art. 27 \u00a7 737(c) and Md.Rule 4-508, on July 2, 1985, the District Court for Montgomery County ordered the expungement of all police and court records with reference to Michael \u201cpertaining to the arrest, detention or confinement on or about 1/20/85.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b745-11\">On November 14, 1985, following the expungement of records, Michael filed the complaint in the case <em>sub judice </em>in which he alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>that Dean\u2019s statements to Budget were defamatory and that Dean had maliciously caused Michael to be prosecuted for malicious destruction of property. On the third day of the trial, Dean\u2019s counsel moved for summary judgment on the ground that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>Waiver and Release which Michael had signed in the ex-pungement proceeding precluded the tort claims against Dean. The circuit court judge denied the motion because, the court reasoned, Michael had not been subjected to any \u201carrest, detention, or confinement,\u201d and, therefore, the release was of no effect. The court stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aat\">\u201c[i]f the general release had included the word \u2018charges\u2019, we would have been out of here yesterday morning before twelve o\u2019clock, and I would have been twenty five cents poorer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">At the conclusion of the trial the jury returned a verdict against Dean Pantazes and Michael DeLorenzo (the Budget employee who signed the application for statement of charges) on both the defamation and malicious prosecution counts. By way of a special verdict sheet the jury awarded the following damages:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-6\">$12,000 Malicious prosecution by both Defendants</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-7\">14.000 Punitive damages for malicious prosecution by Dean</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Alk\">50 Defamation by Dean</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-8\">700 Punitive damages for defamation by Dean</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-9\">15.000 Consortium by both defendants</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AFy\">$41,750</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b746-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-11\">\n<em>The Release</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b746-12\">We discuss separately the effect of the release on the counts for malicious prosecution and for defamation.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-13\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-14\">\n<em>Malicious Prosecution</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b746-15\">In <em>Pemrock, Inc. v. Essco Co., </em>252 Md. 374, 249 A.2d 711 (1969), the Court held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-16\">[A] general release to all mankind barred further suits against other entities involved in the occurrence which produced the settlement with one participant that led to the release. Relied on were various cases holding a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>release of \u201call other persons\u201d did release a joint tort-feasor, including <em>Thomas v. Erie Ins. Exchange, </em>229 Md. 332; .... [182 A.2d 823 (1962)]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b747-6\"><em>Peters v. Butler, </em>253 Md. 7, 10, 251 A.2d 600 (1969). \u201cThus, language releasing \u2018all other persons, firms and corporations\u2019 discharges remaining tort-feasors even though they are not named in the release.\u201d <em>Ralkey v. Minnesota Mining &amp; Mfg. Co., </em>63 Md.App. 515, 525, 492 A.2d 1358 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-7\">It would appear that this general rule would apply to the case <em>sub judice </em>so as to release appellant in the action for malicious prosecution. Budget, Dean Pantazes, and the law enforcement officials can all be considered as joint tort feasors<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in the malicious prosecution. Secondly, the release of \u201cany and all other persons\u201d is the sort of \u201cgeneral release\u201d to which the rule in <em>Pemrock </em>has been found applicable. <em>See Peters v. Butler, </em>253 Md. at 10, 251 A.2d 600; <em>Pemrock, Inc. v. Essco Company, Inc.; Ralkey v. Minnesota Mining &amp; Mfg. Co., </em>63 Md.App. at 524, 492 A.2d 1358. Appellees, however, claim that the rule is not applicable to the release <em>sub judice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b747-8\">Appellees, as did the trial court, take the position that although the release that Michael Pantazes signed is a \u201cgeneral release\u201d, malicious prosecution is not related to \u201cthe occurrence which produced\u201d the release with the State, <em>Peters, </em>253 Md. at 10, 251 A.2d 600; consequently, the parties to the malicious prosecution charge are not affected by the release of March 14, 1985. They contend that the \u201coccurrence which produced the settlement\u201d was a nonexistent \u201carrest, detention or confinement\u201d, as specifically stated in the release, and since none of these events occurred, it could not possibly be related to the occurrence (the malicious prosecution) which is the basis of the present litigation. In other words, appellees contend that the \u201cGeneral Waiver and Release\u201d to the State and \u201call other per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>sons\u201d releases the public from liability for a non-occurrence, for which no one could possibly be liable, in exchange for which Michael Pantazes was granted an early expungement of his records. We do not agree with appellees\u2019 understanding that Michael Pantazes made such an \u201cillusory promise,\u201d <em>Stamatiades v. Merit Music, </em>210 Md. 597, 614, 124 A.2d 829 (1956) (\u201c[W]here the option reserved to the promisor is unlimited ... his promise becomes illusory and incapable of forming part of a legal obligation.\u201d (quoting Williston, Contracts, (Rev.Ed.) Vol. I \u00a7 43)).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">The flaw in appellees\u2019 reasoning is that they treat the signing of the \u201cGeneral Waiver and Release\u201d as if it were part of a criminal proceeding in which they, knowing of a potential ambiguity in the State\u2019s position, can remain silent and later capitalize on that ambiguity. For example, consider the trial testimony of the attorney who represented and advised Michael Pantazes at the time of the expungement process:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-6\">I knew from the evidence, and from my investigation, from the paperwork that, to my knowledge, there was no arrest, no detention, or no confinement on the date in question. And thus, there could be no release to anybody including Mr. Dean Pantazes, for having caused the arrest, detention, or confinement, because there was no such cause of action civilly could be based upon that since it never happened.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-7\">THE COURT: If you don\u2019t comply with the statute, you\u2019re not entitled to the expungement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-8\">THE WITNESS: If\u2014that is not the way I read it\u2014if there was a proper objection by the State\u2019s Attorney to the form of the release, number one; number two, if the Court sustains the objection by the State\u2019s Attorney in the petition for expungement, then in that event, one is not entitled to the release, if the Court rules that way.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ayo\">In this State, however, releases are normally construed and applied according to the rules of contract law, <em>Bernstein v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number><em>Kapneck, </em>290 Md. 452, 458, 430 A.2d 602 (1981); <em>Parish v. Milk Producers Ass\u2019n, </em>250 Md. 24, 101, 242 A.2d 512 (1968); <em>Ralkey v. Minnesota Mining &amp; Mfg. Co., </em>63 Md.App. at 530, 492 A.2d 1358, not criminal law. There is no reason why this rule should not be applied to the present situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-4\">The State and Michael Pantazes, in good faith, entered a mutually beneficial, bilateral agreement, <em>Crane Ice Cream Co. v. Terminal Freezing &amp; Heating Co., </em>147 Md. 588, 593, 128 A. 280 (1925), which was fully supported by adequate consideration on both sides, <em>Beall v. Beall, </em>291 Md. 224, 229, 434 A.2d 1015 (1981); <em>Broaddus v. First National Bank, </em>161 Md. 116, 121-2, 155 A. 309 (1931). Had Michael Pantazes waited the three years required by \u00a7 737, which is the period of limitations for civil actions, Md.Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc.Code Ann. 5-101 (1984 &amp; Supp.1988), then, after that time, the State would have been required, \u00a7 737, to expunge his records without the release requirement. Where, as here, the petitioner elects to obtain expungement of his records prior to the running of the limitations period, then the predicament is created wherein certain evidence is rendered unavailable<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> by which persons sued might defend themselves in a civil action. For this reason, the State, on its own behalf and for the benefit of all other potential defendants in a civil action, bargained to give up its records in exchange for the general release. Michael Pantazes, on the other hand, bargained for an early expungement in exchange for which he gave up his right to sue.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">In light of the understanding that the General Waiver and Release of March 14, 1985, is to be interpreted as a contract, key among the general principles applicable to the interpretation of the agreement is that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>[A] release is to be construed according to the intent of the parties and the object and purpose of the instrument, and that intent will control and limit its operation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AXWc\"><em>Shriver v. Carlin &amp; Fulton Co., </em>155 Md. 51, 64, b141 A. 434 (1928), <em>quoted in Wheaton Lanes v. Rinaldi, </em>236 Md. 525, 531, 204 A.2d 537 (1964). Furthermore:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-5\">The written language embodying the terms of an agreement will govern the rights and liabilities of the parties, irrespective of the intent of the parties at the time they entered into the contract, unless the written language is not susceptible of a clear and definite understanding____\u201d <em>Slice v. Carozza Prop., Inc., </em>215 Md. 357, 368, 137 A.2d 687, 693 (1958). \u201c[Wjhere a contract is plain and unambiguous, there is no room for construction, and it must be presumed that the parties meant what they expressed.\u201d <em>Kasten Constr. v. Rod Enterprises, </em>268 Md. 318, 328, 301 A.2d 12, 18 (1973); <em>Little v. First Federated Life, </em>267 Md. 1, 6, 296 A.2d 372, 375 (1972); <em>Devereux v. Berger, </em>253 Md. 264, 269, 252 A.2d 469, 471 (1969). Thus, when interpreting [an] ... agreement, this Court is \u201cbound to give effect to the plain meaning of the language used.\u201d <em>Woodham v. Woodham, supra </em>[235 Md. 356], 360, 201 A.2d [674], 676 [1964]; <em>Sands v. Sands, 252 </em>Md. 137, 249 A.2d 187 (1969).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b750-7\"><em>Goldberg v. Goldberg, </em>290 Md. 204, 212, 428 A.2d 469 (1981). Finally:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-8\">Where contract language is plain and unambiguous, its meaning should be determined without reference to extrinsic facts or aids. <em>Sternbergh v. Brock, 225 </em>Pa. 279, 74 Atl. 166 (1909); <em>Kennedy v. Erkman, </em>389 Pa. 651, 133 A.2d 550 (1957). Words are to be given their ordinary meaning, <em>Pines Plaza Bowling, Inc. v. Rossview, Inc., </em>394 Pa. 124, 145 A.2d 672 (1958). However, if the language under consideration is ambiguous or uncertain a court must then determine the intention of the parties. In such a case a court may consider evidence of extrinsic factors: <em>i.e., </em>negotiations of the parties, the circumstances surrounding execution of the contract, the parties\u2019 own <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>construction of the contract and the conduct of the parties. <em>De-Moss v. Beryllium Corporation, </em>358 Pa. 470, 58 A.2d 70 (1948); <em>Sternbergh v. Brock, supra; Kennedy v. Erkman, supra.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b751-5\"><em>Mascaro v. Snelling &amp; Snelling of Baltimore, Inc., </em>250 Md. 215, 219, 243 A.2d 1 (1968). Based on these principles, we now consider the agreement <em>sub judice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">First, we reject appellees\u2019 argument that, by the express terms of the agreement, <em>Slice, </em>215 Md. at 368, 137 A.2d 687, a formal criminal \u201carrest\u201d,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> as that word is used in the technical criminal law sense, was a condition precedent to the operation of the release. Our interpretation of the agreement is not to be guided by hypertechnical definitions of the terms, as imposed by the criminal laws, but rather by the ordinary meaning of the words, <em>Woodham, </em>235 Md. at 360, 201 A.2d 674; <em>Liller v. Logsdon, </em>261 Md. 367, 370, 275 A.2d 469 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">Giving effect to the intent of the parties, as expressed in the ordinary meaning of the words in their agreement, is not a simple task. The phrase \u201carrest, detention or confinement\u201d cannot be accurately defined within the four corners of the agreement. Words like \u201carrest\u201d and \u201cdetention\u201d are vague and their definitions are context dependent. \u201cArrest\u201d when used in the criminal context describes a more specific and formal act than when that term is used in a civil context. <em>Compare Morton v. State, </em>284 Md. 526, 530, 397 A.2d 1385 (1979) (quoted in note 5) <em>with Mason v. Wrightson, </em>205 Md. 481, 487, 109 A.2d 128 (1954) (Any exercise of force, or threat of force, by which in fact the other person is deprived of his liberty, compelled to remain where he does not wish to remain, or to go where he does not wish to go, is an imprisonment.), the definition of \u201carrest\u201d also varies within the criminal context, <em>compare </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number><em>Morton, </em>284 Md. at 530, 397 A.2d 1385 (quoted in note 5) <em>with U.S. v. Sayers, </em>698 F.2d 1128, 1130 (Fla.1983) (\u201cArrest\u201d as used in the Speedy Trial Act refers to the point at which a defendant is charged.) Additionally, \u201carrest\u201d is considered to imply considerably more than a \u201cdetention\u201d. <em>See People v. Superior Court of Los Angeles County, </em>7 Cal.3d 186, 101 Cal.Rptr. 837, 496 P.2d 1205, 1215 (1972); <em>U.S. v. Morales, </em>611 F.Supp. 242, 245 (D.C.N.Y.1985); <em>The American Heritage Dictionary </em>(1973); <em>The New American Webster </em>(1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">In light of the evident ambiguity in the words of the agreement, we consider the circumstances of its formation, <em>Mascaro, </em>250 Md. at 229, 243 A.2d 1, in order to effectuate the true intention of the parties (Michael Pantazes and the State), <em>Kasten Construction Co., Inc. v. Rod Enterprises, Inc., </em>268 Md. 318, 301 A.2d 12 (1973).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">On March 22, 1985, appellee, Michael Pantazes, petitioned the district court, under Art. 27 \u00a7 737, \u201cto enter an Order for Expungement of all police and court records pertaining to the above arrest, detention, confinement and charges.\u201d Section 737 specifically informed Michael that in order to proceed with the petition he would be required to waive all claims \u201cfor tortious conduct arising from the <em>charge \u201d </em>and not merely those arising from the \u201carrest, detention or confinement.\u201d Section 737, in conjunction with Md.Rule 4-504(b), explained that this general waiver could be accomplished by signing the \u201cGeneral Waiver and Release,\u201d Md. Rule Exp.Form 2 (1984), which is now before the Court. Therefore, in filing the release along with his \u00a7 737 petition Michael Pantazes clearly intended by that release to satisfy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>the \u00a7 737 requirement that he release \u201cany person from tortious conduct arising from the <em>charge\u201d </em>in general; which would include his claim for malicious prosecution. He did not intend, or did the State, to make an illusory promise to release everyone from a non-existent criminal \u201carrest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">We conclude, therefore, that the \u201coccurrence which produced\u201d the release <em>sub judice </em>was the string of circumstances beginning with the complaint to the police through the final dismissal of the charges. Since the appellant\u2019s acts which gave rise to the complaint for malicious prosecution <em>sub judice </em>were part of that occurrence, the release between the State and Michael Pantazes released that claim, <em>Pemrock, </em>252 Md. 374, 249 A.2d 711, and the circuit court erred in denying the appellant\u2019s motion for summary judgment on that issue. We hold that the \u201cGeneral Waiver and Release,\u201d Md.Rules Form 4-503.2, when filed as part of a petition for expungement of records under Art. 27 \u00a7 737, releases all claims which may arise against any person by reason of his or her being investigated, arrested, detained or confined for, or charged with, a crime. It is not a condition precedent to the operation of the general release that the petitioner be subjected to confinement in jail or prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">\n<em>Defamation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b753-8\">Having determined that the General Waiver and Release was a complete defense to the claim for malicious prosecution, we must now consider what effect that agreement has on the counts for defamation. We hold, for several reasons, that it has no effect whatever.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-9\">First, the \u201cGeneral Waiver and Release\u201d waives \u201call claims which I may have for wrongful conduct <em>by reason of </em>my arrest, detention or confinement____\u201d The claim for defamation, based on Dean Pantazes statements to Budget, however, does not arise \u201cby reason of\u201d the arrest, detention, or confinement. The circumstances which gave rise to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>the claim for defamation preceded and exist wholly independently of the subsequent criminal charges. <em>Compare Krashes v. White, </em>275 Md. 549, 554, 341 A.2d 798 (1975) (discusses the elements of malicious prosecution including the requirement that criminal proceedings be instituted by the defendant against the plaintiff) <em>with Mareck v. Johns Hopkins University, </em>60 Md.App. 217, 223, 482 A.2d 17 (1984) (Elements of defamation include: defamatory statements, publication, and damages.). It follows that, by the controlling express terms of the release, <em>Bernstein v. Kapneck, </em>290 Md. at 459, 430 A.2d 602; <em>Slice v. Carozza Prop., Inc., </em>215 Md. 357, 368, 137 A.2d 687 (1958), the agreement does not affect the claim for defamation.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">Secondly, the defamation was the original tort while the malicious prosecution occurred subsequently. As this Court has held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-6\">[RJelease of an original tort-feasor discharges subsequent tort-feasors, ... [but] the converse ... [is] not true:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AgU\">\u201c[A] wrongdoer is responsible for the reasonably foreseeable consequences of his tortious act, including the negligent conduct of others. [But] it would defy reason to hold the [subsequent tort-feasor] liable for injuries caused by the original wrong doer, which were not the consequences of his own carelessness____\u201d <em>Id. [Kyte v. McMillion, </em>256 Md.] at 105-06, 259 A.2d 532, quoting <em>Derby v.

As to the $15,000 awarded for loss of consortium, our task is more difficult because the jury did not attempt to apportion the damages between malicious prosecution and defamation.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">The law provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-8\">[I]n a proper case ... [the verdict] can be molded or reformed to reflect what the jury manifestly and beyond doubt intended, <em>Davis v.

Since the jury did not apportion the damages awarded for the loss of consortium between the two torts, and because we have reversed the verdict for malicious prosecution, the damages awarded for loss of consortium must also be reversed.
