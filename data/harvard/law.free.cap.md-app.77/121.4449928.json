We shall answer in the affirmative and affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">On February 15, 1983, appellee, Sandra Scott, while employed by the appellant, C&amp;P Telephone Company, was injured when she fell on appellant\u2019s parking lot. Appellee promptly reported the accident to her supervisor, Shirley Palmer, who took her to the hospital. After receiving treatment from the hospital, appellee and Palmer returned to work. In appellee\u2019s presence, Palmer called the C&amp;P benefits office and informed them of the incident. When appellee asked Palmer if there was anything she needed to do, if there were any forms that she needed to fill out, Palmer responded that the forms were coming, that she would fill them out, and that everything would be taken care of. In response to a similar inquiry from appellee\u2019s mother, Palmer repeated that everything would be taken care of.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">Thereafter, and continuing for more than two years, appellant paid appellee\u2019s medical bills and lost wages. Having no knowledge of worker\u2019s compensation, and relying on her supervisor\u2019s assurances that everything would be taken care of, appellee did not immediately file a claim with the Worker\u2019s Compensation Commission. Indeed, she did not file a claim until November 1, 1985, twenty-eight months after the Employer\u2019s First Report was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">Md.Ann.Code, Article 101, Section 39 provides that \u201cfailure of an employee to file a claim for compensation within two years from the date of the accident shall constitute a complete bar\u201d to that claim. Where, however, the employee\u2019s failure to file a claim \u201cwas induced or occasioned by fraud, or by facts and circumstances amounting to an estoppel,\u201d the employee has one additional year from the time that the fraud is discovered or the facts and circumstances amounting to an estoppel cease, within which to file a claim. Md.Ann.Code Art. 101, \u00a7 39(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>Appellee does not claim that she was prevented by fraud from filing a claim; instead, she argues that C &amp; P\u2019s actions amount to an estoppel, barring it from raising limitations as a defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">Equitable Estoppel, as that term is used in the Worker\u2019s Compensation Act, \u201cis the effect of the voluntary conduct of a party whereby he is absolutely precluded both at law and in equity from asserting rights ... against another person who has in good faith relied upon such conduct and has been led thereby to change his position for the worse.\u201d <em>Patapsco and Back Rivers Railroad Co. v. Davis, </em>208 Md. 149, 155, 117 A.2d 566 (1955) (citing <em>Pomeroy\u2019s, Equity Jurisprudence </em>(5th Ed.), Vol. 3, \u00a7 804). Its purpose is \u201cto prevent \u00bf party from asserting his rights under a general technical rule of law, where he has so conducted himself that it would be contrary to equity and good conscience for him to allege and prove the truth.\u201d <em>Rody v. Doyle, </em>181 Md. 195, 200, 29 A.2d 290 (1942). (Citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">It is not necessary that the party\u2019s conduct be egregious or have been done intentionally to mislead, however. <em>Harrison v. McCarty, </em>178 Md. 377, 13 A.2d 544 (1940). If the representation is believed, and relied upon as the inducement for action by the party claiming the benefit of estoppel, the estoppel may be asserted. <em>Patapsco and Back Rivers Railroad Co., supra, </em>208 Md. at 156, 117 A.2d 566. And, of course, as the Court said in <em>Bayshore Industries v. Ziats, </em>232 Md. 167, 174, 192 A.2d 487 (1963) \u201c[w]e think the words \u2018facts and circumstances amounting to an estoppel\u2019 as used in \u00a7 39 of our Act are not to be interpreted narrowly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">In deciding whether there was sufficient evidence to submit the case <em>sub judice </em>to the jury on the issue of estoppel, we must assume the truth of the testimony presented by appellee. <em>Webb v. Johnson, </em>195 Md. 587, 591, 74 A.2d 7 (1950). It is not our duty to decide whether the actions of appellant amounted to an estoppel. Rather, our duty is to determine whether there was sufficient evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>for the jury to have the opportunity to decide that question. <em>Patapsco and Back Rivers Railroad Co., supra, </em>208 Md. at 152, 117 A.2d 566. In making that determination we are guided by our decision in <em>Miller v. Michalek, </em>13 Md.App. 16, 17-18, 281 A.2d 117, <em>cert. granted, </em>263 Md. 717 (1971), <em>cert. dismissed, </em>January 26, 1972, where we said, \u201cIf there is any competent evidence, however slight, leading to support the plaintiffs right to recover, the case should be submitted to the jury.\u201d (Citation omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">We hold that the evidence in the case before us was sufficient to submit the issue of estoppel to the jury. The unrefuted testimony of appellee establishes that, as we noted earlier, after the accident she inquired as to whether there was anything she needed to do. In response to that query, as we also noted earlier, she was assured by her supervisor that everything would be taken care of and that she need not worry about anything. And, of course, her mother received similar assurances. For more than two years thereafter, C&amp;P paid all of appellee\u2019s medical bills, including prescriptions, and compensated her fully for wages lost due to time missed from work.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">In our view, the jury could reasonably have found from the evidence before it that the broad statements of appellee\u2019s supervisor taken together with C &amp; P\u2019s conduct, were such as to induce appellee to believe that all matters relating to a compensation claim would be taken care of. The trial judge was correct in submitting the issue of estoppel to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
