Judge Arrie W. Davis, who presided at appellant\u2019s trial, sentenced him to consecutive terms of life imprisonment for the rape and sexual offense. Additionally, he imposed concurrent sentences of 20 years imprisonment for the burglary and three years incarceration for the deadly weapon violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">The jury was presented with legally sufficient evidence that in the early morning hours of July 11, 1987, appellant broke into the home of Michelle Johnson. Threatening her with a knife, he forced her to engage in vaginal intercourse and to perform fellatio upon him.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">Appellant poses these questions for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-7\">1. Did the trial court err when it recalled, sua sponte, the alleged victim to provide the jury with further testimony about the incident in question?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-8\">2. Should appellant\u2019s sentence for unlawfully wearing and carrying a deadly weapon be merged?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b291-9\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-10\">Appellant\u2019s first contention concerns the trial judge\u2019s participation in eliciting testimony from the prosecuting witness. In response to direct and cross-examination, Ms. Johnson described the violence accompanying appellant\u2019s attack upon her in some detail but only referred to the sexual activity in which she was forced to engage as \u201coral sex\u201d and \u201cintercourse.\u201d After the Assistant State\u2019s Attorney announced that she had no further questions on redirect examination, the following took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-11\">THE COURT: Miss Johnson, I hate to do it to you because I know it is very unpleasant, but the State\u2019s Attorney has asked you certain questions. Some of the questions related to what happened after the defendant made overtures. I am going to have to ask you, as much as I don\u2019t want to do this, to ask you to specifically tell us what he did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-12\">MR. HEDGEPETH [Defense Counsel]: Your Honor, may we approach the bench?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>THE COURT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-5\">(Whereupon, counsel and the defendant approached the bench.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-6\">MR. HEDGEPETH: Your Honor, I would have to object to the Court\u2019s attempts to fill a deficiency in the State\u2019s case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-7\">THE COURT: Ms. Bruning, we had testimony that the defendant had oral sex with the victim. I am not sure what the Court of Special Appeals is going to make out of that. Oral sex can be a whole lot of things. Excuse me for being flip about it, but it could be having one\u2019s mouth on one\u2019s big toe. That could be oral sex.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-8\">MS. BRUNING [Assistant State\u2019s Attorney]: The Court can take judicial notice\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-9\">THE COURT: It is not me. It is the Court of Special Appeals.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-10\">MS. BRUNING: I would ask permission to reopen the case and clarify that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-11\">MR. HEDGEPETH: I would object. She had a prompt from the Court. It would seem to me if there is a deficiency in the State\u2019s case, it is not the Court\u2019s duty to repair it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-12\">THE COURT: I won\u2019t repair it. I will permit the State to reopen it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-13\">MR. HEDGEPETH: I\u2019d object.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-14\">THE COURT: Very well.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-15\">(End of bench conference.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-16\">BY MS. BRUNING:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-17\">Q Miss Johnson, just a few more questions. You said the defendant had vaginal intercourse with you. What did you mean exactly? What did he do with you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-18\">MR. HEDGEPETH: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-19\">THE COURT: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-20\">THE WITNESS: He got me down on the bed and climbed on top of me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-21\">BY MS. BRUNING:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>Q When he climbed on top of you, what did he do then?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-4\">MR. HEDGEPETH: I would object.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-5\">THE COURT: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-6\">THE WITNESS: He had sex with me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-7\">BY MS. BRUNING:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-8\">Q What do you mean had sex?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-9\">MR. HEDGEPETH: I would object.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-10\">THE COURT: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-11\">BY MS. BRUNING:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-12\">Q Refer to the specific parts of the body and any part you had contact with.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-13\">A He fondled my body and inserted his penis into my vaginal area.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-14\">Q Did he penetrate your vagina?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-15\">MR. HEDGEPETH: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-16\">THE COURT: I sustain the objection as to the form. Where if anywhere did he put his penis?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-17\">THE WITNESS: In my vagina.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-18\">THE COURT: Ms. Bruning?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-19\">BY MS. BRUNING:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-20\">Q After that, you said both before and after the vaginal intercourse, that he had oral sex with you. What do you mean by that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-21\">MR. HEDGEPETH: I would object.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-22\">THE COURT: Objection is noted for the record. Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-23\">THE WITNESS: In other words, we had sex by my mouth on his penis. He placed his penis in my mouth.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-24\">While the presiding judge in a jury trial must exercise restraint in participating in the interrogation of witnesses at trial lest he compromise his or her role as an impartial arbitrator in the eyes of the jury, it is well settled that the judge may question the witnesses to insure that the facts in the case are fully developed. <em>Cardin v. State, </em>73 Md.App. 200, 229, 533 A.2d 928 (1987); <em>Lane v. State, </em>60 Md.App. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>412, 429-30, 483 A.2d 369 (1984); <em>Bell v. State, </em>48 Md.App. 669, 678, 429 A.2d 300 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">Judge Davis did not abuse the discretion vested in him in this regard in the instant case. He recognized a potential ambiguity in the testimony of the only witness to the <em>corpus delicti </em>of the crimes with which the appellant was charged. His actions aimed at clarifying that testimony did not manifest any opinion adverse to appellant. The interrogation was not protracted. There is no allegation that his demeanor or the inflection of his voice in any way prejudiced the appellant. In sum, his inquiries were appropriate and undoubtedly aided the jurors in performing their duty to apply the applicable law to the evidence in determining appellant\u2019s guilt <em>vel non </em>of the crimes with which he was charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">Appellant contends that his conviction of carrying a weapon openly with intent to injure should merge with his conviction of first degree rape and first degree sexual offense. We reject that proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">The Fifth Amendment\u2019s guarantee to a criminal defendant that he or she will not twice be placed in jeopardy for the same offense, which is applicable to the states by virtue of the Fourteenth Amendment, <em>Benton v. Maryland, </em>395 U.S. 784, 89 S.Ct. 2056, 23 L.Ed.2d 707 (1969), prohibits multiple punishment for the same offense. <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>420 U.S. 332, 342-43, 95 S.Ct. 1013, 1021, 43 L.Ed.2d 232 (1975); <em>Newton v. State, </em>280 Md. 260, 263, 373 A.2d 262 (1977). Where a defendant is convicted of more than one crime as a result of one criminal escapade, we determine whether he may be punished for each crime by application of the \u201crequired evidence\u201d or \u201cBlockburger\u201d test.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Nightingale v. State, </em>312 Md. 699, 702-03, 542 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>373 (1988); <em>Newton v. State, supra, </em>280 Md. at 268, 373 A.2d 262. In <em>Newton, </em>Judge Eldridge, speaking for the Court, set forth the elements of this test:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-5\">If each offense requires proof of a fact which the other does not, the offenses are not the same and do not merge. However, if only one offense requires proof of a fact which the other does not, the offenses are deemed the same, and separate sentences for each offense are prohibited.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-6\"><em>Newton, </em>280 Md. at 268, 373 A.2d 262.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">When this test is applied to the crimes of which appellant has been convicted, we hold that carrying a weapon openly with intent to injure, which is proscribed by Md.Code Ann. Article 27, \u00a7 36,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> is not the same as his offenses under either Md.Code Ann., Article 27, \u00a7 462<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (first degree rape) or Md.Code Ann. Article 27, \u00a7 464<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (first degree sexual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>offense).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">Article 27, \u00a7 462 requires proof of vaginal intercourse with the victim and Article 27, \u00a7 464 requires proof that the offender engaged in a sexual act, as defined in Article 27, \u00a7 461, with the victim. Neither must be proved to obtain a conviction under Article 27, \u00a7 36. Furthermore, although one of the alternative elements in the commission of both first degree rape and first degree sexual offense is that the accused \u201c[EJmploys or displays a dangerous or deadly weapon,\u201d there is no requirement that prior to that employment or display that he have carried that weapon openly with intent to injure, a required element of the offense punishable by Article 27, \u00a7 36. <em>Cf. Brooks v. State, </em>284 Md. 416, 419-23, 397 A.2d 596 (1979) (holding that carrying a weapon openly with intent to injure did not merge into assault with intent to murder); <em>Williams v. State, </em>205 Md. 470, 478-80, 109 A.2d 89 (1954) (holding that breaking and entry with intent to commit a felony, to wit, grand larceny, did not merge with grand larceny); <em>Walker v. State, </em>53 Md.App. 171, 202-04, 452 A.2d 1234 (1982) (holding that carrying a weapon openly with intent to injure did not merge into attempted first degree rape conviction).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">Finally, appellant asserts that even if the conviction under Article 27, \u00a7 36 did not merge into the convictions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>under Article 27, \u00a7 462 or Article 27, \u00a7 464, nevertheless, we should construe these statutes as expressing the intent of the General Assembly against punishment for each of the crimes separately. His reliance on the rule of lenity (sometimes called merger by legislative intent) in support of this assertion is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">The prohibition against carrying a weapon openly with intent to injure was originally enacted by Chapter 375 of the Acts of 1886. Sections 462 and 464 of Article 27 were enacted 90 years later by Chapter 573 of the Acts of 1976. There is no indication that the legislature intended that punishment for these sexual offenses should preclude punishment for conduct proscribed by Article 27, \u00a7 36. Moreover, when we examine the conduct proscribed by Article 27, \u00a7 36 with the conduct prohibited by either \u00a7 462 or \u00a7 464 of Article 27, the offenses:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-5\">(1) do not constitute conduct proscribed by a <em>\u201csingle </em>statute,\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-6\">(2) are not \u201cof necessity closely intertwined,\u201d and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-7\">(3) do not relate to each other in such a manner that one offense is \u201cnecessarily the overt act\u201d of the other. Nor is this a situation in which one of the statutes \u201cby its very nature affects other offenses.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-8\"><em>Dillsworth v. State, </em>308 Md. 354, 367, 519 A.2d 1269 (1987) <em>(quoting Johnson v. State, </em>56 Md.App. 205, 215, 467 A.2d 544 (1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>299 Md. 136, 472 A.2d 999 (1984)). Because these relationships between the offense punishable by Article 27, \u00a7 36 and the offenses punishable by either \u00a7 462 or \u00a7 464 of Article 27 are not present, we will not assume an ambiguity in the legislative intent which would call the rule of lenity into play.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-9\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED: COSTS TO BE PAID BY THE APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b294-9\">. <em>Blockburger v.
