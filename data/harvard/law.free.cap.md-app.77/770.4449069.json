Appellee, Salinda Elizabeth Tittsworth, brought her vehicle to a stop, after pumping her brakes, behind a car that had stopped rather abruptly in front of her because of a red traffic light at the intersection of Farragut Road. Appellant, Milton Thomas Ford, Jr., was unable to stop his automobile before it struck appellee\u2019s car. Appellee brought suit in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County. The case was tried before a jury, which returned a verdict in favor of appellee in the amount of $50,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-10\">Appealing from the judgment entered on that verdict, Mr. Ford presents a single issue for our consideration:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b801-11\">Did the trial court err in failing to grant defendant\u2019s Motion for Judgment in light of the plaintiff\u2019s failure to present any evidence of defendant\u2019s alleged negligence?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b801-14\">We shall not address that issue, however, because appellant failed to preserve it for appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>At the conclusion of the plaintiffs case, appellant\u2019s counsel made an oral motion \u201cthat the court dismiss the complaint as against the defendant in that there has been no showing of primary negligence,\u201d citing, as authority, the case of <em>Brehm v. Lorenz, </em>206 Md. 500, 112 A.2d 475 (1954).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court treated that motion as one for judgment and denied it. Appellant then testified as to his version of the accident. The court instructed the jury, after which appellant\u2019s counsel advised the court that he had no objections or exceptions to the instructions, adding, however:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-5\">But I would like to put on the record just for paperwork and clearing up things that I\u2019m renewing my motion for a verdict in favor of the plaintiff [sic] at the conclusion of the entire case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">Counsel then corrected his slip of the tongue, saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-7\">In favor of the defendant. I\u2019m renewing my motion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"APlU\">Maryland Rule 2-519, which governs such motions for judgment in civil cases, provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-8\">Rule 2-519. MOTION FOR JUDGMENT</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AOdS\">(a) Generally.\u2014A party may move for judgment on any or all of the issues in any action at the close of the evidence offered by an opposing party, and in a jury trial at the close of all the evidence. The moving party shall state with particularity all reasons why the motion should be granted. No objection to the motion for judgment shall be necessary. A party does not waive the right to make the motion by introducing evidence during the presentation of an opposing party\u2019s case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-9\">(c) Effect of Denial.\u2014A party who moves for judgment at the close of the evidence offered by an opposing party may offer evidence in the event the motion is not granted, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>without having reserved the right to do so and to the same extent as if the motion had not been made. In so doing, the party withdraws the motion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b803-4\">In criminal procedure, the counterpart of Rule 2-519 is Rule 4-324, governing motions for judgment of acquittal. Rule 4-824(a) permits a defendant in a criminal case to move for acquittal at the close of the evidence offered by the State and, in a jury trial, at the close of all the evidence. That rule, paralleling 2-519(a), requires the moving party\u2014 the defendant\u2014to \u201cstate with particularity all reasons why the motion should be granted.\u201d And Rule 4-824(c) provides, as does Rule 2-519(c), that in the event the motion for acquittal (judgment) made at the close of the evidence offered by the State (opposing party) is denied, the defendant (moving party) may offer evidence without having reserved the right to do so and to the same extent as if the motion had not been made. In so doing, however, the defendant (party) withdraws the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">In <em>State v. Lyles, </em>308 Md. 129, 135, 517 A.2d 761 (1986), the Court of Appeals held that the language of Rule 4-824, requiring a movant for acquittal to state with particularity all reasons why the motion should be granted, was mandatory and that if the defendant fails to comply with that provision the issue is not preserved for appellate review. We later held, in <em>Warfield v. State, </em>76 Md.App. 141, 543 A.2d 885, <em>cert. granted, </em>314 Md. 95, 548 A.2d 845 (1988), that if the defendant withdraws his motion made at the conclusion of the State\u2019s case by offering evidence, it will not suffice for him merely to \u201crenew\u201d his motion at the close of all the evidence. To preserve the issue, he must again \u201cstate with particularity all reasons why the motion should be granted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">Since the criminal rule, 4-824, was so drafted as to make it consistent with its civil counterpart, Rule 2-519, <em>State v. Lyles, </em>308 Md. at 135, 517 A.2d 761; <em>Lyles v. State, </em>63 Md.App. 376, 382, 492 A.2d 959 (1985), we deem it imperative to apply the same ruling with respect to \u201crenewal\u201d of a motion for judgment under the civil rule as we applied to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>\u201crenewal\u201d of a motion for acquittal under the criminal rule. Our holding is in accordance with the decision of the Court of Appeals in <em>Rockville Corp. v. Rogan, </em>246 Md. 482, 229 A.2d 76 (1967). There, in dealing with then Rule 552, a precursor to current Rule 2-519 (when the appropriate motion was one for a directed verdict rather than for judgment), the Court held that by introducing evidence after his motion was denied the appellant withdrew the motion; his subsequent motion, at the conclusion of all the evidence, without stating the grounds therefor, left nothing for the Court to review on appeal. Consequently, even if appellant\u2019s motion, made at the conclusion of the plaintiff\u2019s case, can be regarded as satisfying the requirement of particularity because it referred to the holding in <em>Brehm v. Lorenz, </em>that motion was withdrawn by the presentation of appellant\u2019s testimony. The subsequent \u201crenewal\u201d of the motion, to \u201cput it on the record just for paperwork and clearing up things,\u201d did not comply with the requirement of particularity.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">Appellant waived his right to complain about any lack of evidence of negligence on his part by failing to preserve that issue for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-7\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b802-10\">. The holding of <em>Brehm v. Lorenz, </em>\"that the mere happening of a rear end collision of two motor vehicles, without evidence of the circumstances under which it happened, is not proof of negligence of either driver,\u201d has probably been quoted and relied upon by every defendant in every automobile rear end collision case in Maryland since 1955.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
