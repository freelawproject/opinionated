Reg. 20,815 (Apr. 26, 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b1395-5\">Pending before the Court is the Motion for Judgment on the Agency Record filed by the Korean Producers, which raises a single challenge to Commerce\u2019s Final Results. Specifically, the Korean Producers assert that Commerce\u2019s use of its controversial \u201czeroing\u201d methodology in the administrative review at issue was not permissible because the agency has ceased use of zeroing in certain original anti-dumping investigations. The Korean Producers therefore ask that this matter be remanded to Commerce with instructions to recalculate their dumping margins without using zeroing. <em>See generally </em>Brief in Support of the Motion of Plaintiffs Dongbu Steel Co., Ltd. and Union Steel Manufacturing Co., Ltd. for Judgment Upon the Agency Record (\u201cPis. Brief\u2019); Reply Brief of Plaintiffs Dongbu Steel Co., Ltd. and Union Steel Manufacturing Co., Ltd. (\u201cPis. Reply Brief\u2019).</p>\n<p id=\"b1395-6\">The Korean Producers\u2019 motion is opposed by the Government, as well as domestic steel producers ArcelorMittal USA Inc. and United States Steel Corporation (collectively, the \u201cDomestic Producers\u201d). The Government and the Domestic Producers urge that Commerce\u2019s Final Results be sustained in all respects. <em>See generally </em>Defendant\u2019s Response in Opposition to Plaintiffs\u2019 Motion for Judgment Upon the Agency Record (\u201cDef. Brief\u2019); Defendant-Intervenor ArcelorMittal\u2019s Opposition to Motion for Judgment on the Agency Record of Plaintiffs Dongbu Steel Co., Ltd. and Union Steel Manufacturing Co., Ltd.

Antidumping duty investigations (referred to herein as \u201coriginal\u201d investigations) are initiated to determine in the first instance \u201cwhether the elements necessary for the imposition of [an anti-dumping] duty ... exist.\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1673a. In addition, the statute provides for periodic (annual) administrative reviews of antidumping duty orders (at the request of an interested party), to update the applicable antidumping duty rate. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1356\">*1356</page-number>19 U.S.C \u00a7 1675.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The instant case challenges the results of such an administrative review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1396-4\">In an administrative review, Commerce determines the antidumping duties to be imposed by first calculating the \u201cdumping margin\u201d for each of a foreign producer/exporter\u2019s individual U.S. transactions <em>(i.e., </em>entries), which is the amount by which the normal value of the imported subject merchandise exceeds the \u201cexport price\u201d or the \u201cconstructed export price\u201d of that merchandise. <em>See </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1673, 1677(35)(A).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Next, Commerce calculates the \u201cweighted-average dumping margin,\u201d by \u201cdividing the aggregate dumping margins determined for a specific exporter or producer by the aggregate export prices and constructed export prices of such exporter or producer.\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(35)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b1396-5\">Commerce uses the \u201czeroing\u201d methodology when calculating the weighted-average dumping margin (discussed above). <em>See NSK Ltd. v. United States, </em>510 F.3d 1375, 1379 (Fed.Cir.2007); <em>Corus Staal BV v. United States, </em>502 F.3d 1370, 1372 (Fed. Cir.2007) <em>(\u201cCorns Staal II </em>\u201d); <em>Timken Co. v. United States, </em>354 F.3d 1334, 1338 (Fed. Cir.2004). Specifically, Commerce \u201czeros\u201d negative dumping margins (dumping margins with a value less than zero) by replacing the negative figure with a value of zero prior to inputting the data into the weighted-average dumping margin calculation. <em>See NSK, </em>510 F.3d at 1379; <em>Corns Staal II, </em>502 F.3d at 1372; <em>Timken, </em>354 F.3d at 1338. In other words, if the export price or constructed export price for a particular transaction is higher than normal value, Commerce assigns a margin of zero \u2014 rather than a negative margin \u2014 to that transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1396-9\">As a result, \u201conly positive dumping margins <em>(i.e., </em>margins for sales of merchandise sold at dumped prices) [are] aggregated, and negative margins <em>(i.e., </em>margins for sales of merchandise sold at nondumped prices) [are] given a value of zero.\u201d <em>Corus Staal BV v. United States, </em>395 F.3d 1343, 1345-46 (Fed.Cir.2005) <em>(\u201cCorns Staal </em>/\u201d). Use of Commerce\u2019s zeroing methodology thus prevents negative dumping margins from reducing the overall sum of the dumping margins. <em>See NSK </em>510 F.3d at 1379; <em>Corus Staal II, </em>502 F.3d at 1372 (\u201cwhen Commerce calculates the weighted average dumping margin, the dumping margins for sales below normal value are not offset by \u2018negative dumping margins\u2019 for those sales made above normal value\u201d). In short, zeroing \u2014 in effect \u2014 increases a producer/exporter\u2019s dumping margin (resulting in higher antidumping duties), or results in a finding of dumping where (absent the use of zeroing) dumping would not be found.</p>\n<p id=\"b1396-10\">Commerce\u2019s zeroing methodology has spawned a cottage industry of litigation, both at home and abroad. The agency\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1357\">*1357</page-number>\u201clong-standing practice\u201d has withstood repeated attack here at home. <em>See NSK, </em>510 F.3d at 1379. Under a deferential <em>Chevron </em>step two analysis, the Court of Appeals has upheld as reasonable Commerce\u2019s original interpretation of the statute as authorizing zeroing in both original antidumping investigations and administrative reviews. Thus, in an unbroken line of decisions, the Court of Appeals has sustained Commerce\u2019s use of zeroing both in original antidumping investigations, <em>see, e.g., Corus Staal I, </em>395 F.3d at 1347, and in administrative reviews, <em>see, e.g., Koyo Seiko Co. v. United States, </em>551 F.3d 1286, 1291 (Fed.Cir.2008); <em>NSK, </em>510 F.3d at 1380; <em>Timken, </em>354 F.3d at 1342-44.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1397-5\">But the situation abroad is quite a different story. The World Trade Organization (\u201cWTO\u201d) Dispute Settlement Body has repeatedly ruled that Commerce\u2019s use of zeroing \u2014 in both original investigations and administrative reviews \u2014 is inconsistent with the United States\u2019 obligations under the WTO antidumping agreements. <em>See generally, e.g., NSK, </em>510 F.3d at 1379 (discussing WTO rulings); <em>U.S. Steel Corp. v. United States, </em>33 CIT -, 637 F.Supp.2d 1199, 1206-07 (2009) (discussing additional WTO rulings), <em>appeal docketed, </em>No. 2009-1572 (Fed.Cir. Sept. 16, 2009). In accordance with Sections 123 and 129 of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act (\u201cURAA\u201d), Commerce has implemented aspects of these adverse WTO rulings.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Of particular relevance here, in its \u201cSection 123 Determination\u201d promulgated in response to one of the WTO rulings, Commerce announced its decision to discontinue the use of zeroing in certain original antidumping investigations. <em>See </em>Anti-dumping Proceedings: Calculation of the Weighted-Average Dumping Margin During an Antidumping Investigation; Final Modification, 71 Fed.Reg. 77,722 (Dec. 27, 2006) (\u201cSection 123 Determination\u201d).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1358\">*1358</page-number>that same Section 123 Determination, however, Commerce expressly declined to cease the use of zeroing in any other context \u2014 including antidumping administrative reviews, such as the administrative review at issue in this action. <em>See </em>Section 123 Determination, 71 Fed.Reg. at 77,724.</p>\n<p id=\"b1398-4\">Since the Section 123 Determination issued, courts have sustained Commerce\u2019s continued use of zeroing in administrative reviews while ceasing the practice in certain original antidumping investigations. <em>See, e.g., Corus Staal II, </em>502 F.3d at 1373-74; <em>JTEKT Corp. v. United States, </em>33 CIT -, 675 F.Supp.2d 1206, 2009 WL 4897287 at *3-6 (2009); <em>Union Steel v. United States, </em>33 CIT-, 645 F.Supp.2d 1298, 1305-09 (2009); <em>Fujian Lianfu Forestry Co. v. United States, </em>33 CIT-, 638 F.Supp.2d 1325, 1356-57 (2009); <em>Corus Staal BV v. United States, </em>32 CIT-, 593 F.Supp.2d 1373, 1382-87 (2008) (\u201cCotos St<em>aal-CIT 2008\u201d), appeal docketed, </em>No. 2009-1425 (Fed.Cir. July 1, 2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b1398-12\">Against this backdrop, the Korean Producers here assert yet another in a long line of challenges to Commerce\u2019s use of zeroing in administrative reviews, contesting the agency\u2019s Final Results in the twelfth administrative review of the anti-dumping duty order on corrosion-resistant carbon steel flat products from Korea. In the Final Results, Commerce determined, <em>inter alia, </em>the weighted-average dumping margins for Dongbu and Union Steel. <em>See </em>Final Results, 72 Fed.Reg. at 13,087.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As in prior administrative reviews, in calculating the Korean Producers\u2019 weighted-average dumping margins, Commerce zeroed the negative dumping margins of individual U.S. transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1398-15\">The Korean Producers did not raise the subject of zeroing in their case briefs or their rebuttal briefs filed with Commerce in the course of the administrative review, although the agency\u2019s Preliminary Results employed the methodology, and notwithstanding the fact that the agency had previously given notice of a proposal to cease the use of zeroing in certain original anti-dumping investigations. <em>See </em>Def. Brief at 7-8; Transcript of Oral Argument (\u201cTr.\u201d) at 40-41; Antidumping Proceedings: Calculation of the Weighted Average Dumping Margin During an Antidumping Duty Investigation, 71 Fed.Reg. 11,189 (Mar. 6, 2006) (\u201cProposed Section 123 Determination\u201d). However, after the final Section 123 Determination issued (officially ceasing zeroing in certain original antidumping investigations), the Korean Producers sent Commerce a letter citing that determination and protesting the continued use of zeroing in the then-ongoing administrative review. <em>See </em>Tr. at 41, 62, 69-70. Commerce rejected the Korean Producers\u2019 submission as untimely. <em>See id. </em>The Korean Producers thus renew their objections here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1399-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1359\">*1359</page-number>II. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1399-5\">In reviewing Commerce\u2019s final determination in an antidumping proceeding, the agency\u2019s determination must be upheld, except to the extent that it is found \u201cto be unsupported by substantial evidence on the record, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d <em>See </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516a(b)(l)(B)(i); <em>see also NMB Singapore Ltd. v. United States, 557 </em>F.3d 1316, 1319 (Fed.Cir.2009). Substantial evidence is \u201cmore than a mere scintilla\u201d; rather, it is \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Universal Camera Corp. v. Nat\u2019l Labor Relations Bd., </em>340 U.S. 474, 477, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951) <em>(quoting Consol. Edison Co. v. Nat\u2019l Labor Relations Bd., </em>305 U.S. 197, 229, 59 S.Ct. 206, 83 L.Ed. 126 (1938)); <em>see also Mittal Steel Point Lisas Ltd. v. United States, </em>548 F.3d 1375, 1380 (Fed.Cir.2008) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b1399-6\">To determine whether an agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute is in accordance with law, the two-part test set forth in <em>Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984) is applied. <em>See Corus Staal I, </em>395 F.3d at 1346; <em>Timken, </em>354 F.3d at 1341. The first step of a <em>Chevron </em>analysis requires a determination as to \u201cwhether Congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.\u201d <em>Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 842, 104 S.Ct. 2778. \u201cIf the intent of Congress is clear, that is the end of the matter; for the court, as well as the agency, must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 842-43, 104 S.Ct. 2778; <em>see also Corus Staal I, </em>395 F.3d at 1346. However, \u201cif the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue\u201d in question, the analysis proceeds to <em>Chevron </em>step two, where \u201cthe question for the court is whether the agency\u2019s answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.\u201d <em>Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 843, 104 S.Ct. 2778.</p>\n<p id=\"b1399-8\">Under the second step of a <em>Chevron </em>analysis, \u201c[a]ny reasonable construction of the statute is a permissible construction.\u201d <em>Timken, </em>354 F.3d at 1342 <em>(quoting Torrington v. United States, </em>82 F.3d 1039, 1044 (Fed.Cir.1996)) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cTo survive judicial scrutiny, [Commerce\u2019s] construction need not be the only reasonable interpretation or even the most reasonable interpretation .... Rather, a court must defer to an agency\u2019s reasonable interpretation of a statute even if the court might have preferred another.\u201d <em>Timken, </em>354 F.3d at 1342 <em>(quoting Koyo Seiko Co. v. United States, </em>36 F.3d 1565, 1570 (Fed.Cir.1994) <em>(citing Zenith Radio Corp. v. United States, </em>437 U.S. 443, 450, 98 S.Ct. 2441, 57 L.Ed.2d 337 (1978))) (internal quotation marks omitted). Indeed, the Court of Appeals has underscored that, \u201c[i]n recognition of Commerce\u2019s expertise in the field of antidumping investigations,\u201d <em>Corns Staal I, </em>395 F.3d at 1346, \u201c[d]eference to [the] agency\u2019s statutory interpretation is at its peak in the ease of a court\u2019s review of Commerce\u2019s interpretation of the anti-dumping laws.\u201d <em>Koyo Seiko, </em>36 F.3d at 1570.</p>\n<p id=\"b1399-9\">III. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1399-10\">In their sole claim challenging Commerce\u2019s Final Results, the Korean Producers contend that Commerce\u2019s new interpretation of the antidumping statute\u2014 precluding zeroing in certain original anti-dumping investigations, but continuing the practice in administrative reviews \u2014 is unreasonable and impermissible under the second step of <em>Chevron. </em>The Korean Producers assert that Commerce\u2019s new interpretation effectively strips away a key premise underpinning the Court of Appeals precedent sustaining the agency\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1360\">*1360</page-number>practice of zeroing. <em>See </em>Pis. Brief at 6, 8, 12, 19; Pis. Reply Brief at 4, 8-10. The Korean Producers argue that the Court of Appeals\u2019 <em>Chevron </em>analysis is therefore no longer valid, and that a new <em>Chevron </em>step two analysis is required. <em>See </em>Pis. Brief at 8, 12; Pis. Reply Brief at 10. The Korean Producers further maintain that Commerce\u2019s new interpretation of the statute cannot withstand <em>Chevron </em>step two scrutiny. <em>See </em>Pis. Brief at 7, 13-19; Pis. Reply Brief at 7-15. Accordingly, the Korean Producers conclude that this matter must be remanded to Commerce with instructions to recalculate their dumping margins without using zeroing. <em>See </em>Pis. Brief at 20; Pis. Reply Brief at 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b1400-5\">The Government asserts, as a threshold matter, that the Korean Producers failed to exhaust their administrative remedies, and that their challenge to Commerce\u2019s use of zeroing is thus not properly before the Court. <em>See generally </em>Def. Brief at 5, 7-8. In the alternative, the Government and the Domestic Producers contend that the propriety of Commerce\u2019s use of zeroing in administrative reviews is a well-settled matter, and that the Korean Producers\u2019 arguments do nothing to cast doubt on the continued vitality of the Court of Appeals decisions upholding the agency\u2019s statutory interpretation authorizing zeroing in cases such as this. <em>See generally </em>Def. Brief at 5, 8-11; Arcelor-Mittal Brief at 2, 6-13; U.S. Steel Brief at 7-8, 15-22. The Government and the Domestic Producers further contend that, even if Commerce\u2019s new statutory interpretation were to be subjected to a new <em>Chevron </em>step two analysis, that interpretation would be sustained. <em>See, e.g., </em>Def. Brief at 11-15; ArcelorMittal Brief at 13-17. U.S. Steel even goes so far as to argue that zeroing is not merely permitted by the statute, it is required. <em>See </em>U.S. Steel Brief at 6-7, 8-15.</p>\n<p id=\"b1400-8\">As outlined below, the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies does not bar consideration of the merits of the Korean Producers\u2019 claim. However, the Court of Appeals has spoken definitively, and repeatedly, on the subject of zeroing. The Korean Producers\u2019 arguments here simply do not warrant revisiting the established line of Court of Appeals precedent sustaining Commerce\u2019s statutory interpretation permitting zeroing in administrative reviews. The Korean Producers\u2019 Motion for Judgment on the Agency Record therefore must be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1400-9\">A. <em>Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1400-10\">The Government initially contends that the Korean Producers are \u201cattempt[ing] to challenge Commerce\u2019s zeroing methodology without ever having raised the issue before the agency,\u201d and argues that the Korean Producers\u2019 claim is thus precluded by the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies. <em>See generally </em>Def. Brief at 5, 7-8; Tr. at 15-20, 25-28, 57-58, 61-64, 77-78.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Government\u2019s reliance on the doctrine of exhaustion is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b1401-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1361\">*1361</page-number>According to the Government, the Korean Producers were obligated to raise their objections to zeroing in their case brief filed in the course of the administrative review. The Government observes that, by that time, the Korean Producers were on notice that Commerce was applying zeroing in their case (since zeroing was used in the Preliminary Results in the administrative review), and, further, that the Proposed Section 123 Determination had issued (indicating Commerce\u2019s tentative plans to cease zeroing in certain original antidumping investigations). <em>See </em>Def. Brief at 5, 7-8; Proposed Section 123 Determination, 71 Fed.Reg. at 11,189.</p>\n<p id=\"b1401-5\">But the Government attaches undue weight to Commerce\u2019s Proposed Section 123 Determination. Given the preliminary and tentative nature of the document (which sought public comment on Commerce\u2019s proposal), the Proposed Section 123 Determination simply did not suffice to trigger any duty on the part of the Korean Producers to raise any objections that they may have had in the administrative review. Although the Korean Producers might have been well-advised to raise their concerns in their case briefs filed with the agency (concerns which, by definition, would have been somewhat hypothetical), they were under no legal obligation to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1401-8\">In a situation such as this, the law does not require a party to be prescient, and to be able to precisely predict the timing and the exact contours of collateral final government action that may have a bearing on its case. Until the final Section 123 Determination issued (by which time briefing in the administrative review was complete), there was no official determination by Commerce that zeroing would cease only in certain original antidumping investigations.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies thus has no application here, because the Korean Producers\u2019 objections were not yet ripe at the time case briefs were due in the administrative review. The Korean Producers were not required to exhaust their remedies before the agency, because there was nothing to exhaust. <em>See </em>Tr. at 41-42, 49, 69-70; <em>see also Zhengzhou Harmoni Spice Co. v. United States, </em>33 CIT-, 617 F.Supp.2d 1281, 1318 n. 49 (2009); <em>cf. Consol. Bearings Co. v. United States, </em>348 F.3d 997, 1003-04 (Fed.Cir.2003) (rejecting Government\u2019s claim that plaintiff failed to exhaust its remedies, and concluding that there simply was \u201c[no] administrative procedure to exhaust\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1401-11\">The Korean Producers assert that\u2014 even if the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies were applicable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1362\">*1362</page-number>(which it is not) \u2014 their failure to raise the issue of zeroing in their briefs filed with Commerce could be excused under either of two widely-recognized exceptions to the doctrine of exhaustion \u2014 the \u201cpure question of law\u201d exception and the \u201cfutility\u201d exception. <em>See generally </em>Pis. Reply Brief at 1-3; Tr. at 40-43.</p>\n<p id=\"b1402-4\">In the instant case, there is no need for agency development of a factual record. And the Korean Producers\u2019 challenge to Commerce\u2019s new statutory interpretation presents a \u201cpure question of law.\u201d As in <em>Agro Dutch, </em>\u201c[statutory construction alone\u201d is sufficient to resolve the merits of the Korean Producers\u2019 claim. <em>See Agro Dutch Indus. Ltd. v. United States, </em>508 F.3d 1024, 1029 (Fed.Cir.2007) <em>Cquoting Consol. Bearings, </em>348 F.3d at 1003) (internal quotation marks omitted). Further, as in Agro <em>Dutch, </em>\u201cCommerce has not persuasively articulated ... how additional proceedings [at the agency level] would [have] further developed] the interpretation offered here\u201d and elsewhere by the agency. <em>See Agro Dutch, </em>508 F.3d at 1029 n. 4. Thus \u2014 even assuming that the doctrine of exhaustion applied in this case \u2014 the \u201cpure question of law\u201d exception would permit the Korean Producers to pursue their zeroing claim in this forum.</p>\n<p id=\"b1402-5\">Similarly, it is well established that \u201c[a] party need not exhaust [its] administrative remedies where invoking such remedies would be futile.\u201d <em>See Asociacion Colombiana de Exportadores de Flores v. United States, </em>916 F.2d 1571, 1575 (Fed. Cir.1990). Although the \u201cfutility\u201d exception is a narrow one, the Korean Producers pointedly note that \u201ceven Commerce does not contend that had [the Korean Producers] raised [their zeroing] argument during the administrative proceedings, there is any possibility that the agency would have altered its zeroing methodology as applied in [the administrative] review\u201d at issue here. <em>See </em>Pis. Reply Brief at 3; Tr. at 42-43; <em>see also Corns Staal II, </em>502 F.3d at 1379 (noting that \u201cfutility\u201d exception is narrow). Accordingly, assuming that the doctrine of exhaustion applied in this case (which it does not), the Korean Producers could also rely on the \u201cfutility\u201d exception to litigate their zeroing claim here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1402-7\">The Court of Appeals has repeatedly held that, in trade cases, the application of the principles of the doctrine of exhaustion of remedies is a matter committed to the sound discretion of this court. <em>See, e.g., Corus Staal II, </em>502 F.3d at 1381 (and cases cited there). As detailed above, the doctrine of exhaustion does not apply in this case; and, even if it did, several exceptions nevertheless would permit the Korean Producers to seek judicial review of their zeroing claims. The doctrine of exhaustion therefore does not preclude consideration of the merits of the Korean Producers\u2019 arguments; and the Government\u2019s assertions to the contrary must be rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b1402-8\">B. <em>Commerce\u2019s Use of Zeroing in Administrative Reviews</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1402-9\">The Korean Producers contend that Commerce\u2019s construction of 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(35) \u2014 the basis for the agency\u2019s use of zeroing in this administrative review \u2014 is not reasonable, and is therefore not in accordance with law. <em>See </em>Pis. Brief at 2, 6, 17, 19, 20; Pis. Reply Brief at 4, 12, 13-14; Tr. at 6. The Korean Producers candidly acknowledge the long and unbroken line of decisions by the Court of Appeals and the Court of International Trade which have consistently upheld Commerce\u2019s practice of zeroing, both in original antidumping investigations and in administrative reviews. <em>See </em>Pis. Brief at 6, 7; Tr. at 2-3, 51, 85. But the Korean Producers argue that Commerce\u2019s new statutory interpretation set forth in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1363\">*1363</page-number>agency\u2019s Section 123 Determination \u201cjustifies a fresh review of this issue by this Court.\u201d <em>See </em>Pis. Brief at 8; <em>see also id. </em>at 6, 12; Pis. Reply Brief at 10; Tr. at 51-52.</p>\n<p id=\"b1403-5\">The Korean Producers emphasize that, in its Section 123 Determination, \u201cCommerce for the first time ... interpreted [19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(35) ] to mean one thing with respect to antidumping investigations ([ie.,] that weighted average dumping margins should be calculated without zeroing negative dumping margins), and to mean the exact opposite with respect to antidumping administrative reviews ([ie.,] that weighted average dumping margins should be calculated by zeroing negative dumping margins).\u201d <em>See </em>Pis. Brief at 8; <em>see also id. </em>at 6, 12, 14-15, 16, 19; Pis. Reply Brief at 4. The Korean Producers seek to make much of the fact that the Court of Appeals has never squarely \u201cconsidered the question of whether Commerce\u2019s new statutory interpretation \u2014 that [19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(35) ] provides for zeroing in administrative reviews but not in investigations \u2014 is reasonable within the meaning of step two of Chevron.\u201d <em>See </em>Pis. Brief at 8; <em>see also id. </em>at 12; Pis. Reply Brief at 7,10; Tr. at 3-4.</p>\n<p id=\"b1403-6\">According to the Korean Producers, the Court of Appeals\u2019 decisions in <em>Timken </em>and <em>Corus Staal I </em>were \u201cexpressly premised on the fact that the same statutory provision governed the weight-averaging element of Commerce\u2019s dumping margin methodology and that Commerce was applying that provision consistently in both types of proceedings <em>[ie., </em>in both original antidumping investigations and administrative reviews].\u201d <em>See </em>Pls. Reply Brief at 9-10; <em>see also </em>Pis. Brief at 8, 12, 16-17, 19; Tr. at 5, 10-11, 45-46, 51-52, 54, 70-72, 85, 88-89. According to the Korean Producers, the Section 123 Determination undermined this alleged foundation of the Court of Appeals\u2019 holdings affirming the use of zeroing. <em>See </em>Pis. Brief at 12, 17, 19; Pis. Reply Brief at 10; Tr. at 10-11, 47-48, 51-52, 54, 70, 85, 88-89. The Korean Producers contend that a <em>Chevron </em>step two analysis of Commerce\u2019s new statutory interpretation is therefore required. <em>See </em>Pis. Brief at 8, 12; Pis. Reply Brief at 10; Tr. at 11, 14-15, 51-52, 54, 85. The Korean Producers maintain that \u201cCommerce\u2019s interpretation of the identical statutory provision to have two diametrically opposite meanings is unreasonable and directly contrary to the previous holding[s] of the Federal Circuit in <em>Corns Staal I </em>and <em>Timken.\u201d See </em>Pis. Reply Brief at 4 (citations omitted); <em>see also id. </em>at 7, 9-10, 13-14; Pis.

The threshold question presented by the Korean Producers\u2019 claim is thus whether one or more of the Court of Appeals\u2019 decisions on zeroing are controlling in this case. Only if no such decision is controlling is the requested \u201cfresh review of this issue\u201d permissible. <em>See </em>Pis. Brief at 8; <em>see also </em>Pis. Reply Brief at 10 (urging \u201ca fresh <em>Chevron </em>step two analysis of Commerce\u2019s current statutory interpretation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1403-11\">A recent decision of this court considered \u2014 and rejected \u2014 the precise arguments that the Korean Producers press in this case. <em>See generally Union Steel, </em>33 CIT at-, 645 F.Supp.2d at 1305-09.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1364\">*1364</page-number>The court in <em>Union Steel </em>relied heavily on <em>Corus Staal II, </em>in which the Court of Appeals sustained as reasonable Commerce\u2019s use of zeroing in an administrative review. <em>See Union Steel, </em>33 CIT at-, 645 F.Supp.2d at 1307-08 (discussing <em>Corus Staal II, </em>502 F.3d 1370). In <em>Corns Staal II, </em>the Court <em>of </em>Appeals took specific note of Commerce\u2019s Section 123 Determination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1404-6\">When Commerce announced the elimination of zeroing in conjunction with the use of average-to-average comparisons to calculate dumping margins in anti-dumping investigations, it stated that the new policy did not apply to any other proceedings, including administrative reviews. [Section 123 Determination], 71 Fed.Reg. 77772, 77772-24 (Dec. 27, 2006). Thus, Commerce\u2019s new policy has no bearing on the present appeal. ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1404-7\"><em>Corus Staal II, </em>502 F.3d at 1374. The Court of Appeals concluded that, \u201c[t]o the extent recent developments have changed the current scheme, Commerce has made it clear that those changes do not apply retroactively to administrative reviews. Thus, our previous determination [in <em>Corus Staal I, </em>395 F.3d at 1349] that Commerce\u2019s policy of zeroing is permissible under the statute applies to the challenged administrative review.\u201d <em>Corus Staal II, </em>502 F.3d at 1375.</p>\n<p id=\"b1404-8\">As <em>Union Steel </em>explained, the Court of Appeals in <em>Corns Staal II </em>\u201cmade it amply clear that it did not consider Commerce\u2019s decision to discontinue zeroing when performing average-to-average comparisons in antidumping investigations while continuing zeroing in administrative reviews to be a sufficient basis to disturb its precedents, under which it had held zeroing to be permissible in administrative reviews based on the reasonableness of the Department\u2019s construction of 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(35).\u201d <em>See Union Steel, </em>33 CIT at -, 645 F.Supp.2d at 1308. Similarly, here, as in <em>Union Steel, Corus Staal II </em>is controlling on the question presented by the Korean Producers\u2019 claim. Thus, here, as in <em>Union Steel, </em>Commerce\u2019s construction of 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(35) must be sustained as reasonable. The Korean Producers\u2019 argument that the Section 123 Determination marked the first time that Commerce has interpreted 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(35) \u201cto mean one thing with respect to antidumping investigations ... and to mean the exact opposite with respect to antidumping administrative reviews\u201d does not suffice to distinguish the Korean Producers\u2019 zeroing claim from the Court of Appeals\u2019 precedent established in <em>Corus Staal II. See Union Steel, 33 </em>CIT at-, 645 F.Supp.2d at 1308.</p>\n<p id=\"b1404-13\">In <em>NSK, </em>another administrative review case, the Court of Appeals took a similar tack, rejecting the argument that it should hold Commerce\u2019s use of zeroing unlawful based on a WTO ruling and on official statements signaling the United States\u2019 intent to comply with that ruling. <em>See NSK, </em>510 F.3d at 1379-80. The Court of Appeals explained that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1404-14\">... until Commerce abandons zeroing in administrative reviews such as this one, a remand ... would be unavailing. Therefore, because Commerce\u2019s zeroing practice is in accordance with our well-established precedent, <em>until Commerce officially abandons the practice pursu</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1365\">*1365</page-number><em>ant to the specified statutory scheme, we affirm its continued use in this case.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"A6g\"><em>Id. </em>at 1380 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1405-5\">The Korean Producers maintain that <em>Corns Staal II </em>and <em>NSK </em>are distinguishable from the case at bar because the administrative reviews in those two cases were completed before Commerce\u2019s Section 123 Determination was published. <em>See </em>Pis. Reply Brief at 7; Tr. at 49-50. But the asserted distinction is illusory. In <em>Corns Staal II, </em>the Court of Appeals expressly ruled that the Section 123 Determination has no bearing on the reasonableness of Commerce\u2019s construction of the statute as permitting zeroing in administrative reviews, noting that the Section 123 Determination \u2014 by its very terms \u2014 does not apply to such proceedings. <em>See Corus Staal 11, </em>502 F.3d at 1374-75. Given the breadth of the Court of Appeals\u2019 holding in <em>Corns Staal II </em>and the rationale underlying it, the fact that the administrative review at issue here was completed after the issuance and the effective date of the Section 123 Determination is not enough to place this case beyond the ambit of <em>Corns Staal II </em>and NSK.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1405-7\">To much the same effect are the Court of Appeals\u2019 recent decisions in <em>Koyo Seiko </em>and <em>SKF, </em>which also involved challenges to the results of an administrative review. <em>See generally Koyo Seiko, </em>551 F.3d at 1290-91; <em>SKF USA Inc. v. United States, </em>537 F.3d 1373, 1381-82 (Fed.Cir.2008). In <em>SKF, </em>the Court of Appeals once again sustained Commerce\u2019s use of zeroing in administrative reviews, concluding that there was no argument \u201cnot fully resolved by [the Court of Appeals\u2019] established precedent.\u201d <em>See SKF, </em>537 F.3d at 1382 <em>(citing Corus Staal II, </em>502 F.3d at 1374; <em>Corns Staal I, </em>395 F.3d at 1349; <em>Timken, </em>354 F.3d at 1342).</p>\n<p id=\"b1405-10\"><em>Koyo Seiko </em>concerned a challenge to the same determination at issue in <em>SKF, </em>and reached the same result. <em>See Koyo Seiko, </em>551 F.3d at 1290 (holding <em>SKF </em>\u201ccontrolling\u201d on Commerce\u2019s use of zeroing in administrative reviews). <em>Koyo Seiko </em>reiterated the Court of Appeals\u2019 bottom line in <em>NSK: </em>\u201cUnless and until [Commerce\u2019s policy on zeroing is changed \u2018pursuant to the specified statutory scheme\u2019], [the] court has nothing to review.\u201d <em>See Koyo Seiko, </em>551 F.3d at 1291 <em>(quoting NSK, </em>510 F.3d at 1380). Accordingly, while the Korean Producers are correct that the Court of Appeals has not squarely confronted the precise arguments that they have framed in this case and in <em>Union Steel, </em>the thrust of the Court of Appeals\u2019 jurisprudence is clear: Commerce\u2019s use of zeroing in administrative reviews (or, for that matter, any antidumping proceeding) will be sustained as reasonable \u2014 \u201c[u]nless and until\u201d Commerce officially abandons the practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1405-11\">Equally unavailing is the Korean Producers\u2019 claim that the Court of Appeals\u2019 decisions in <em>Timken </em>and <em>Corns Staal I </em>were \u201cexpressly premised on the fact that the same statutory provision governed the weight-averaging element of Commerce\u2019s dumping margin methodology and that Commerce was applying that provision consistently in both [administrative reviews and original antidumping investigations].\u201d <em>See </em>Pis. Reply Brief at 10; <em>see also id. </em>at 9. The Korean Producers\u2019 interpretations of the holdings in <em>Timken </em>and <em>Corns Staal I </em>are simply unduly narrow and cramped when read in the light of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1366\">*1366</page-number><em>Corus Staal II, NSK, </em>and other relevant precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1406-4\">The result in this case not only parallels that in <em>Union Steel, </em>but is also consistent with the outcome in <em>Corns Staal-CIT 2008.

Commerce rejected the Korean Producers' letter as untimely. <em>See </em>Section I, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AuG\">The Government is thus less than fully candid when it accuses the Korean Producers of \"attempt[ing] to challenge Commerce\u2019s zeroing methodology without ever having raised the issue before the agency.\u201d <em>See </em>Def. Brief at 7; <em>see also id. </em>at 5 (asserting that \u201cat no time did [the Korean Producers] raise a challenge [to zeroing] before Commerce\u201d), 8 (arguing that \u201c[h]ad [the Korean Producers] raised the [zeroing] issue before Commerce,\u201d the agency could have addressed the subject <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1361\">*1361</page-number>in the Final Results). ArcelorMittal is guilty of the same offense. <em>See </em>ArcelorMittal Brief at 17 n. 6 (stating that ''[n]either Dongbu nor Union sought to raise the issue of [zeroing] with the Department following the December 2007 [issuance of the final Section 123 Determination]\").</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1401-7\">. It is worth noting that the public comments on Commerce's Proposed Section 123 Determination included comments urging the agency to abandon the zeroing methodology vis-a-vis <em>all </em>antidumping proceedings \u2014 not just in certain original antidumping investigations, as the agency proposed. <em>See </em>Section 123 Determination, 71 Fed.Reg. at 77,724. Similarly, if issuance of the final Section 123 Determination had been delayed until after Commerce had issued the Final Results of the administrative review in question, the Korean Producers might have considered retroactivity an insurmountable hurdle, and thus might not have objected to Commerce\u2019s use of zeroing in the instant administrative review. <em>See </em>Section 123 Determination, 71 Fed.Reg. at 77,-722 (noting that Commerce extended the period of time for filing of comments); <em>id. </em>at 77,724-25 (discussing public comments as to whether a new agency policy on zeroing should apply to ongoing proceedings, as well as whether it should apply retroactively).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1403-7\">.
