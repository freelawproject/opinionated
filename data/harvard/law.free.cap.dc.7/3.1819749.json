The question is not a new one, but has been several times decided by the court. ' The bill is filed avowedly for the purpose of dissolving a copartnership, and one of the copartners holding the fund the other prayed an injunction to prevent the disposal of the money, and for placing it in the hands of a receiver, which was granted, and thereupon an appeal was taken. We think the order appealed from is an interlocutory matter, and does not involve the merits of the controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b11-13\">\n<em>The appeal is therefore dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
