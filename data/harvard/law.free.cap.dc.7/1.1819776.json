The landlord has the right to make such repairs as are needed, but not so as to disturb the tenant\u2019s enjoyment of the premises further than is absolutely necessary to put and keep them in the same condition they were in when the lease was mad e. If he goes beyond this limit he is a trespasser.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b9-11\">2.

In this we think there was error; and as it was the turning point and key to the whole- controversy, we do not propose to examine the bills of exception <em>seriatim.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b10-10\">\n<em>The judgment is reversed and a new trial granted.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
