This Proclamation \u201creserved from all forms of appropriation under the public-land laws\u201d most of Anacapa and Santa Barbara Is<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>lands, which were then federal lands,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and set them aside as the Channel Islands National Monument.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As the Proclamation recognized, these islands \u201ccontain fossils of Pleistocene elephants and ancient trees, and furnish noteworthy examples of ancient volcanism, deposition, and active sea erosion . . . .\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">The two large islands and the many smaller islets and rocks surrounding them also shelter a variety of marine life, some rare or endangered. Prompted by a desire to protect these species <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and other \u201cobjects of geological and scientific interest,\u201d President Truman issued a Proclamation in 1949, enlarging the Monument to encompass \u201cthe areas within one nautical mile of the shoreline of Anacapa and Santa Barbara Islands . . . .\u201d Presidential Proclamation No. 2825, 63 Stat. 1258. It is undisputed that the islets and protruding rocks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>within these one-mile belts have long belonged to the United States and, as a result of President Truman\u2019s Proclamation, are now part of the Monument.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It is equally clear that the tidelands of Anacapa and Santa Barbara Islands, as well as of the islets and rocks, belong to California.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> What is disputed in this litigation is dominion over the submerged lands and waters within the one-mile belts surrounding Anacapa and Santa Barbara Islands.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">When President Truman issued Proclamation No. 2825 in 1949, the submerged lands and waters within these belts were under federal dominion and control, as a result of this Court\u2019s decision two years earlier in <em>United States </em>v. <em>California, </em>332 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>U. S. 19. That case had held that the United States was \u201cpossessed of paramount rights in, and full dominion and power over, the lands, minerals and other things underlying the Pacific Ocean lying seaward of the ordinary low-water mark on the coast of California, and outside of the inland waters, extending seaward three nautical miles <em>. . . United States </em>v. <em>California, </em>332 U. S. 804, 805.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">There can be no serious question, therefore, that the President in 1949 had power under the Antiquities Act to reserve the submerged lands and waters within the one-mile belts as a national monument, since they were then \u201ccontrolled by the Government of the United States.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Thus, whether Proclamation No. 2825 did in fact reserve these submerged lands and waters, or only the islets and protruding rocks, could be, at the time of the Proclamation, a question only of Presidential intent, not of Presidential power.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">In addressing the controversy now before us, the parties have devoted large parts of their briefs to canvassing this question of intent: What did the Proclamation mean by the use of the word \u201careas\u201d? <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We find it unnecessary, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>to decide this question. For even assuming that President Truman intended to reserve the submerged lands and waters within the one-mile belts for Monument purposes, we have concluded that the Submerged Lands Act, 67 Stat. 29, 43 U. S. C. \u00a7 1301 <em>et seq., </em>subsequently transferred dominion over them to California.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">The very purpose of the Submerged Lands Act was to undo the effect of this Court's 1947 decision in <em>United States </em>v. <em>California, </em>332 U. S. 19. In enacting it, Congress \u201crecognized, confirmed, established, and vested in and assigned to,\u201d \u00a7 6 (a), 67 Stat. 32, 43 U. S. C. \u00a7 1314 (a), the States \u201c(1) title to and ownership of the lands beneath navigable waters within the boundaries of the respective States, and the natural resources within such lands and waters, and (2) the right and power to manage, administer, lease, develop, and use the said lands and natural resources . . . \u00a7 3 (a), 67 Stat. 30, 43 U. S. C. \u00a7 1311 (a). The submerged lands and waters within one mile of Anacapa and Santa Barbara Islands plainly fall within this general grant.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>The United States contends, however, that the Submerged Lands Act did not operate to relinquish these submerged lands and waters to California because of an exception to the broad statutory grant that Congress provided in \u00a7 5 (a) of the Act.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The final clause of \u00a7 5 (a), upon which the United States relies, exempted from the grant \u201cany rights the United States has in lands presently and actually occupied by the United States under claim of right.\u201d <footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The legislative history shows that this \u201cclaim of right\u201d clause was added to preserve unperfected claims of federal title from extinction under \u00a7 3's general \u201cconveyance or quitclaim or assignment.\u201d <footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In the words of the Acting Chairman of the Senate Committee on Interior and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>Insular Affairs, the clause \u201cneither validates the claim nor prejudices it,\u201d but merely \u201cleaves it where we found it\u201d for eventual adjudication.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">The entire purpose of the Submerged Lands Act would have been nullified, however, if the \u201cclaim of right\u201d exemption saved claims of the United States based solely upon this Court\u2019s 1947 decision in <em>United States </em>v. <em>California. </em>Not surprisingly, therefore, the legislative history unmistakably shows that the \u201cclaim of right\u201d must be \u201cother than the claim arising by virtue of the decision in [that case] . . . <footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Thus, this exception applies to the submerged lands and waters in controversy here only if the United States\u2019 claim to them ultimately rests on some basis other than the \u201cparamount rights\u201d doctrine of this Court\u2019s 1947 <em>California </em>decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">The United States has pointed to no other basis for believing that the submerged lands and waters in question were owned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>or controlled by the United States in 1949. The crucial question, then, is whether the 1949 reservation of the submerged lands and waters for Monument purposes (assuming that was the intent of the Proclamation) somehow changed the nature of the Government\u2019s claim. If it did not \u2014 if the ownership or control of these areas by the United States in 1953 existed solely by virtue of this Court\u2019s 1947 decision in <em>United States </em>v. <em>California </em>\u2014 then \u00a7 3 (a) of the Submerged Lands Act transferred \u201ctitle to and ownership of\u201d the submerged lands and waters to California, along with \u201cthe right and power to manage, administer, lease, develop, and use\u201d them. 67 Stat. 30, 43 U. S. C. \u00a7 1311 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">We have concluded that the 1949 Proclamation did not and could not enhance the strength of the Government\u2019s basic claim to a property interest in the submerged lands and waters in controversy. Reservation of federally controlled public lands for national monument purposes has the effect of placing the area reserved under the \u201csupervision, management, and control\u201d of the Director of the National Park Service. 39 Stat. 535, 16 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 1-3 (1976 ed.). Without such reservation, the federal lands would remain subject to \u201cprivate appropriation and disposal under the public land laws,\u201d 78 Stat. 985, 43 U. S. C. \u00a7 1400 (c), or to continued federal management for other designated purposes, see, <em>e. g., ibid.; </em>78 Stat. 986, 43 U. S. C. \u00a7 1411. The Antiquities Act of 1906 permits the President, \u201cin his discretion,\u201d to create a national monument and reserve land for its use simply by issuing a proclamation with respect to land \u201cowned or controlled by the Government of the United States.\u201d 34 Stat. 225, 16 U. S. C. \u00a7 431 (1976 ed.). A reservation under the Antiquities Act thus means no more than that the land is shifted from one federal use, and perhaps from one federal managing agency, to another.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>A reservation for a national monument purpose cannot operate to escalate the underlying claim of the United States to the land in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">Congress was well aware of its power to transfer to the States as much or as little of the submerged lands in which the Government held \u201cparamount rights\u201d as it deemed wise. With that knowledge, Congress expressly \u201cemphasize [d] that the exceptions spelled out in [\u00a7 5] do not in anywise include any claim resting solely upon the doctrine of 'paramount rights\u2019 enunciated by the Supreme Court with respect to the Federal Government\u2019s status in the areas beyond inland waters and mean low tide.\u201d S. Rep. No. 133, 83d Cong., 1st Sess., pt. 1, p. 20 (1953). A plainer statement of congressional intent would be hard to find.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">Because the United States\u2019 claim to the submerged lands and waters within one mile of Anacapa and Santa Barbara Islands derives solely from the doctrine of \u201cparamount rights\u201d announced in this Court\u2019s 1947 <em>California </em>decision, we hold that, by operation of the Submerged Lands Act, the Government\u2019s proprietary and administrative interests in these areas passed to the State of California in 1953.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>The parties are requested to submit an appropriate decree within 90 days. <em>So ordered.</em></p>\n<judges id=\"b94-5\">Mr. Justice Marshall took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b85-7\"> This case is part of ongoing litigation stemming from an action brought in this Court more than three decades ago. <em>United States </em>v. <em>California, </em>332 U.

C. \u00a7 431 (1976 ed.), provides in pertinent part as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-10\">\u201cThe President of the United States is authorized, in his discretion, to declare by public proclamation historic landmarks, historic and prehistoric structures, and other objects of historic or scientific interest that are situated upon the lands owned or controlled by the Government of the United States to be national monuments, and may reserve as a part thereof parcels of land, the limits of which in all cases shall be confined to the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management of the objects to be protected.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b86-6\"> Federal title to the islands can be traced to the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, 9 Stat. 922, by which Mexico ceded to the United States the islands lying off the coast of California, along with the adjacent mainland. See Bowman, The Question of Sovereignty over California\u2019s Off-Shore Islands, 31 Pac. Hist. Rev. 291 (1962). While the Treaty obligated the United States to respect private property rights derived from Mexican land grants, all nongranted lands previously held by the Government of Mexico passed into the federal public domain. When California was admitted to the Union in 1850, the United States retained ownership of these public lands. See An Act for the Admission of the State of California into the Union, 9 Stat. 452.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b86-7\"> The 1938 Proclamation did not reserve as a national monument the entire land area of these two islands. Portions were exempted for continued lighthouse purposes, for which the entire islands had previously been reserved. 52 Stat. 1541.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b86-8\"> As early as 1940, Government officials recognized that enlargement of the Monument would be desirable to protect the birds, sea otters, elephant seals, and fur seals that inhabit the rocks and islets encircling the two large islands, and early drafts of the 1949 Proclamation acknowledged an intent to protect marine life. But after a representative of the Department of Justice expressed the view that the Antiquities Act did not permit establishment or enlargement of a national monument to protect plant and animal life, all references to marine life were dropped from the Proclamation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b87-6\"> As noted previously, the Antiquities Act authorizes the President to set aside only \u201clands owned or controlled by the Government of the United States <em>. . . </em>34 Stat. 225, 16 U. S. C. \u00a7431 (1976 ed.). Like Anacapa and Santa Barbara Islands, the islets and rocks protruding above the water within the boundaries of the extended Monument were in 1949 public lands owned by the Federal Government. See n. 3, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b87-9\"> The term \u201ctidelands\" is \u201cdefined as the shore of the mainland and of islands, between the line of mean high water and the line of mean lower low water . . . .\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>California, </em>382 U. S., at 452. Those tidelands in California that had not been subject to Mexican land grants entered the federal public domain in 1848, where they remained in trust until California gained statehood in 1850. At that time, they passed to the State under the \u201cequal footing\u201d doctrine. See <em>Borax, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Los Angeles, </em>296 U. S. 10; <em>United States </em>v. <em>California, </em>382 U. S. 448. Because the tidelands within the Monument were not \u201cowned or controlled\" by the United States in 1938 or in 1949, Presidents Roosevelt and Truman could not have reserved them by simply issuing proclamations pursuant to the Antiquities Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b87-10\"> The present controversy apparently arose when California was frustrated in carrying out its program of leases for the harvesting of kelp in these waters. Giant kelp known as <em>Macrocystis </em>grows in the water along portions of the California coast and is harvested to obtain various substances, including algin, a chemical with many commercial uses. See North, Giant Kelp, Sequoias of the Sea, National Geographic (Aug. 1972), and Zahl, Algae: the Life-givers, National Geographic (Mar. 1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b88-7\"> Although the Antiquities Act refers to \u201clands,\u201d this Court has recognized that it also authorizes the reservation of waters located on or over federal lands. See <em>Cappaert </em>v. <em>United States, </em>426 U. S. 128, 138-142; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Oregon, </em>295 U. S. 1, 14.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b88-8\"> In preparation for the Proclamation, memoranda were circulated within .and among Government agencies, many of which proposed adding to the Monument \u201call islets, rocks, and waters\u201d within one nautical mile of Anacapa and Santa Barbara Islands. The final version of the 1949 Proclamation, however, was not so clear. It began: \u201cWHEREAS it appears that certain <em>islets and rocks </em>situated near Anacapa and Santa Barbara Islands . . . are required for the proper care, management, and protection of the objects of geological and scientific interest located on lands within [the Channel Islands National Monument] . . .\u201d (emphasis added). The Proclamation then went on to reserve \u201cthe areas within one nautical mile\u201d of each of the two large islands, \u201cas indicated on the diagram hereto attached The diagram showed Anacapa and Santa Barbara Islands, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>each encircled by a broken line at a distance of one mile from the island\u2019s shoreline.

His purpose was to guarantee \u201cthat all installations and acquisitions of the Federal Government within such area [as was to be ceded] belong to it.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Senator Holland\u2019s original Joint Resolution No. 13 had provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-10\">\u201cThere is excepted from the operation of section 3 of this Act\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-11\">\u201c(a) all specifically described tracts or parcels of land <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>and resources therein or improvements thereon title to which has been lawfully and expressly acquired by the United States from any State or from any person in whom title had vested under the decisions of the courts of such State, or their respective grantees, or successors in interest, by cession, grant, quitclaim, or condemnation or from any other owner or owners thereof by conveyance or by condemnation, provided such owner or owners had lawfully acquired the title to such lands and resources in accordance with the statutes or decisions of the courts of the State in which the lands are located ....\u201d Hearings 14.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">The Attorney General\u2019s substitute read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-6\">\u201cThere is excepted from the operation of section 3 of this Joint Resolution:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-7\">\u201c(a) all tracts or parcels of land together with all accretions thereto, resources therein, or improvements thereon, title to which has been lawfully and expressly acquired by the United States from any State or from any person in whom title had vested under the law of the State or of the United States, and all lands which the United States lawfully holds under the law of the State; all lands expressly retained by the United States when the State entered the Union; all lands acquired by the United States by eminent domain proceedings; all lands filled in, built up, or otherwise reclaimed by the United States for its own use; and all lands presently occupied by the United States under claim of right. . . <em>Id., </em>at 935.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b95-8\">The clearest, most observable difference between the original draft and the language proposed by the Attorney General is this final statement about \u201clands presently occupied by the United States under claim of right.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The conclusion is that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>some lands to which the United States did not possess outright title might be part of federal installations, and, if so, they were to be preserved in federal control. This inference is strongly supported in further legislative history.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">The Acting Chairman of the Senate Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs explained to the Joint Resolution's author why the Committee had added the phrase concerning claim of right:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-6\">\u201cI should like to add that the last language quoted, namely, 'any rights the United States has in lands presently and actually occupied by the United States under claim of right,\u2019 came into the bill at the request of the Department of Justice. It was presented to the committee and explained by the Department of Justice as being for the purpose of reserving to the Federal Government the area of any installation, or part of an installation \u2014 and I use the term 'installation' to distinguish a specific area, used for a specific purpose, from any vast area that might be claimed under the paramount right doctrine \u2014 actually occupied by the Government under a claim of right.\u201d 99 Cong. Rec. 2619 (1953) (Sen. Cordon).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">The resolution\u2019s author, Senator Holland, asked the Acting Chairman:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-8\">\u201cAm I correct in understanding that under that particular provision the mere fact that the Supreme Court might have held that the United States has paramount rights in submerged lands beyond mean low water, and within State boundaries, would not in any way give the United States the right to claim exceptions of such lands from the joint resolution, <em>in view of the fact that such </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number><em>lands ivould not be \u2018'presently and actually occupied by the United States\u2019? </em>Am I correct in that understanding?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ACf\">\u201cMr. CORDON: The Senator is correct in his understanding.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">Hence, the test is whether the lands held under some claim of right are \u201cactually occupied\u201d by the Federal Government. If so, they are not relinquished.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">The same issue arose in the hearings, with identical resolution. The Acting Chairman explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-7\">\u201c[A]ny land occupied by the United States under claim by the United States that it has a right there, is excluded from this conveyance or quitclaim or assignment. . . . It is general language that . . . protects every installation of every kind.\u201d Hearings 1322.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">Senator Long summarized, to the Acting Chairman\u2019s agreement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-9\">\u201cThat, in effect, says that this act does not at all affect any land which the United States is actually occupying. And that means that a representative of the United States Government in one capacity or another is occupying that land.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b97-10\">Senator Long was concerned that the definition of occupied lands might be stretched to include submerged lands over which the Federal Government had been given dominion in <em>United States </em>v. <em>California, </em>332 U. S. 19 (1947), by reason of the fact that the United States Navy from time to time might sail across them. It was in response to <em>that </em>suggestion that the Acting Chairman made the statement quoted by the majority that \u201c 'the claim of right\u2019 [is] 'other than the claim arising by virtue of the decision in [that case] ....\u2019\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Such a construction was, of course, barred, for it would eviscerate the purpose of returning any sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>merged lands. <em>Ante, </em>at 39. But this ignores the much narrower meaning of \u201csubmerged lands occupied by the United States under claim of right\u201d which was intended: the submerged lands that were actually occupied as part of a federal \u201cinstallation,\u201d meaning \u201ca specific area, used for a specific purpose.\u201d The distinction is between a general claim under <em>United States </em>v. <em>California </em>to paramount rights, and a very specific claim associated with a federal installation actually occupied. Recalling the Acting Chairman\u2019s words: \u201cOccupancy to me is some type of actual either continuous possession or possession in such way as to indicate that the individual claims some special right there different from a vast unoccupied area.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201c[The language is] for the purpose of reserving to the Federal Government the area of any installation, or part of an installation \u2014 and I use the term 'installation\u2019 to distinguish a specific area, used for a specific purpose, from any vast area that might be claimed under the paramount right doctrine . .. .\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">The Channel Islands National Monument includes the submerged lands within a one-mile radius of Anacapa and Santa Barbara Islands.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The parties have stipulated that \u201cthe United States 'presently and actually occupied\u2019 the areas within one nautical mile of the shoreline of Anacapa and Santa</p>\n<p id=\"b99-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>Barbara Islands for purposes of Section 5 of the Submerged Lands Act of 1953, 43 U. S. C. \u00a7 1313.\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The federal occupation is to fulfill the specific purpose of providing for \u201cthe proper care, management, and protection of the objects of geological and scientific interest located' on lands within the said monument.\u201d Presidential Proclamation No. 2825, 63 Stat. 1253. The federal occupation is under claim of right, since only federally \u201cowned or controlled\u201d property can be made into a national monument. 16 U. S. C. \u00a7431 (1976 ed.).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">The majority opinion stresses that the United States\u2019 occupation of the submerged lands within the Channel Islands National Monument<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> was originally premised on federal control of those areas as granted in <em>United States </em>v. <em>California, supra. </em>This is true. The paramount rights of the United States to these submerged lands, and the absence of California title to them, were recognized in that 1947 decision. In 1949, President Truman allocated a small portion of all the submerged lands within the Federal Government\u2019s paramount rights to become part of the Channel Islands National Monument. And in 1953, all the submerged lands not actually occupied by the Federal Government were ceded to the States. But the Channel Islands National'Monument remained.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">Submerged lands for which the federal claim rested \u201csolely upon the doctrine of 'paramount rights\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> were given up by the Federal Government. The majority\u2019s quotation of that statement comes from that part of the Senate Report explaining why the Attorney General\u2019s language was accepted, the language that included for the first time\u2019 \u201crights ... in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>lands presently and actually occupied by the United States under claim of right It says \u201cany claim resting <em>solely </em>upon the doctrine of 'paramount rights' \u201d (emphasis added) is lost to the Federal Government, but the majority holds that any claim <em>originating </em>in the doctrine of paramount rights is lost. The majority does not recognize that some rights can originate in the paramount-rights doctrine, yet rest on actual occupation under claim of right as part of a federal installation, annexed before the doctrine of paramount rights was waived in 1953.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">That, I respectfully submit, is an erroneous interpretation of even that one bit of legislative history.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> It is also contrary to the dominant theme in the legislative history that general, amorphous paramount rights claims were lost, but specific claims coupled with actual occupation of an installation were not. And most critically, the majority view is without support in the statute's plain language that \u201call lands presently occupied by the United States under claim of right\u201d were preserved. It is stipulated that the lands were occupied, and a <em>claim </em>of right certainly arises when a President treats property in a manner to which only United States property is subject.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b94-12\"> 43 U.
