Dix, seeking to set aside an execution sale of real property owned by the Dixes. Default was entered against the Dixes.

The trial judge orally denied both motions for summary judgment.

The trial court's findings of fact and undisputed evidence establish the following facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On 4 June 1998, the Dixes recorded a deed to the property at 432 Hollinswood Avenue, Winston-Salem, North Carolina. Mr. Peterson, a contractor, installed a deck on the seven room, 2,403 square-foot brick house. On 2 December 1998, after the Dixes failed to pay him for the deck, Mr. Peterson timely filed a claim of lien in the amount of $6,055.16. On approximately 25 March 1999, Mr. Peterson brought suit in Forsyth County District Court to enforce his lien.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On 10 April 2000, District Court Judge Roland H. Hayes concluded that Mr. Peterson was entitled to a lien in the sum of $6,055.16 plus interest. The court directed that the property be sold in accordance with Chapter 44A of the North Carolina General Statutes to satisfy Mr. Peterson's lien.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On 26 October 1999-after the filing of Mr. Peterson's claim of lien and his lawsuit to enforce the lien, but before the entry of judgment enforcing the lien-the Dixes borrowed $244,196.47 from Beneficial and gave Beneficial a deed of trust to secure repayment of that loan. Beneficial recorded the deed of trust on 4 November 1999. In April and May 2000, T. Daniel Womble, attorney for Mr. Peterson, attempted unsuccessfully to contact Beneficial at its local office to discuss Mr. Peterson's judgment and its implications for Beneficial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On 11 September 2000, the Dixes filed a motion to claim as exempt the property at 432 Hollinswood Avenue. In that motion, they declared that the property had an estimated value of $219,000.00 and reported that Beneficial held a lien on the property with $247,000.00 still owed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On 3 November 2000, Mr. Peterson obtained a writ of execution from the assistant clerk of superior court allowing the property to be sold at an execution sale to satisfy his judgment. The writ specified that pursuant\n   to a judgment docketed on 10 April 2000, Mr. Peterson was entitled to the sum of $9,546.30. It directed the Sheriff of Forsyth County to satisfy the judgment \"out of the personal property of [the Dixes], and if sufficient personal property cannot be found, then out of the real property belonging to [the Dixes] on the day the judgment was docketed in your county as shown above or any time after that date.\" Nothing in the writ of execution indicated that the underlying judgment had an effective date other than the date of docketing, 10 April 2000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Sheriff of Forsyth County posted a notice of sale announcing the sale of \"all right, title and interest which the Defendants now have or at any time at or after the docketing of the judgment in said action had in and to [432 Hollinswood Avenue].\" The notice of sale also stated, \"This property is being sold subject to all prior liens and encumbrances pending against the property.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Beneficial was not sent notice of the execution sale and the trial court found nothing to indicate that Beneficial otherwise received actual notice of the sale. The property was sold by the sheriff on 19 February 2001 to defendant Ogburn, the highest bidder, for the price of $10,200.00. An order purporting to confirm the sale as required by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.C.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%201-339.67\">\n    N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1-339.67\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2003) was signed by District Court Judge Chester C. Davis. The sale was never confirmed by the clerk of superior court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On 26 March 2001, the sheriff executed a sheriff's deed drafted by Mr. Womble, formerly Mr. Peterson's attorney, identifying Ogburn as the purchaser of the property. On 2 April 2001, Ogburn purported to convey to defendant Renegar by quitclaim deed, again drafted by Mr. Womble, a one-half undivided interest in the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Based on these facts, the trial court concluded that irregularities in the sale, coupled with a grossly inadequate purchase price, warranted setting aside the sale and declaring void the deed from Ogburn to Renegar. The court further concluded that Ogburn and Renegar were entitled to an equitable lien on the property in the amounts of $10,200.00 for the purchase price and $14,794.00 for expenses incurred in maintaining the property. The court ordered that if a second sale was conducted, then the proceeds were to be applied in the following order: (1) sums due the sheriff on account of the sale, (2) the equitable lien granted to Ogburn and Renegar, and (3) the balance due Beneficial pursuant to its deed of trust in the original principal amount of $244,196.47.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   As a preliminary matter, we note that this appeal appears to be interlocutory. Although defendants recite in their brief that they have appealed from a final judgment, the record on appeal does not establish that all claims against all parties have been resolved. While the record on appeal contains an entry of default as to the Dixes, the record on appeal does not contain any default judgment, as provided in Rule 55(b) of the Rules of Civil Procedure. In addition, there is no indication that the claims asserted against defendant Peterson have been addressed in any manner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   When an order resolves some, but not all, of the claims in a lawsuit, any appeal from that order is interlocutory.\n   <em>\n    Mitsubishi Elec. &amp; Elecs.

An appeal is permissible only if (1) the trial court certified the order for immediate interlocutory appeal under Rule 54 of the Rules of Civil Procedure or (2) the order affects a substantial right that would be lost without immediate review.\n   <em>\n    Embler v. Embler,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11433839\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/143/162/#p164\">\n    143 N.C.App. 162\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 164-65,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=545%20S.E.2d%20259\">\n    545 S.E.2d 259\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 261 (2001). The judgment at issue in this appeal does not contain a Rule 54 certification. Defendants were, therefore, required to establish that a substantial right was at issue. Because defendants did not recognize that their appeal was interlocutory, they have failed to meet their burden. Nevertheless, we elect to exercise our authority under Rule 21 of the Rules of Appellate Procedure to review defendants' arguments pursuant to a grant of certiorari.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    II\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Defendants Ogburn and Renegar first assign as error the trial court's failure to\n   grant their motion for summary judgment.

Moreover, defendants' brief does not contain any argument that the trial court erred in concluding that the sales price was grossly inadequate. This issue has not therefore been properly presented for review.

The court also noted both that the deck that had led to the execution sale was, standing alone, valued at $15,500.00-$5,300.00 more than the execution sale price-and the property had been listed for sale at $270,000.00. In the absence of any argument by defendants as to why these findings fail to establish the inadequacy of the price, we decline to set aside the trial court's conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Irregularities in the Execution Sale.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Although in the conclusions of law, the trial court did not specifically enumerate the irregularities upon which it was relying, the court's findings of fact indicate that the court found (1) the Peterson judgment did not specify that it related back to a date earlier than 10 April 2000, the date of the judgment; (2) the sheriff's notice of sale limited the interest being sold to that possessed by defendant as of 10 April 2000 and made the sale subject to any liens prior to that date; and (3) the sale was not confirmed by the clerk of court. We agree that these findings establish the existence of irregularities in the execution sale.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   First, the Peterson judgment did not specify that the lien related back to a prior date.

It also appeared to make any purchase subject to existing liens, which would potentially include Beneficial's nearly $250,000.00 interest in the property. This limitation on the interest being sold constitutes a second irregularity (although one logically flowing from the judgment's failure to include \"relation back\" language).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Third, the trial court relied upon the lack of confirmation by the clerk of superior court.

The language of the statute, indicating that\n   <em>\n    no\n   </em>\n   sale is valid unless confirmed by the clerk of superior court, is, however, mandatory.\n   <em>\n    See Coker v.

Potential effect and not actual effect is all that is required if the ultimate sales price is grossly inadequate: \"Actuality of injury is not a prerequisite of relief.

Rule 59(a)(9) is a catch-all provision that allows a new trial to be granted for \"[a]ny other reason heretofore recognized as grounds for new trial.\" Defendants contend that they were entitled to relief under Rule 59(a)(9) because the trial court should have resolved the equities of the circumstances with an eye towards the acts of and effects on the title insurers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \"It has been long settled in our jurisdiction that an appellate court's review of a trial judge's discretionary ruling either granting or denying a motion to set aside a verdict and order a new trial is strictly limited to the determination of whether the record affirmatively demonstrates a manifest abuse of discretion by the judge.\"\n   <em>\n    Worthington v.
