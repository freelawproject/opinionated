Thus, we assume for purposes of this decision that plaintiffs' second amended complaint adequately alleges that the DAA acted as their joint employer. Thus, the question we must determine is whether, under California law, the DAA may be held liable for overtime wages due under section 510, subdivision (a) when the DAA acted as plaintiffs' joint employer, even though this court concluded in\n   <em>\n    Morales\n   </em>\n   \"public employees in the amusement and recreation industry are exempt from state overtime requirements.\" (\n   <em>\n    Morales\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 1 Cal.App.5th at p. 541,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=206%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%201\">\n    206 Cal.Rptr.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Morales\n   </em>\n   , we concluded that the matter should be remanded to the trial court because the plaintiffs had \"shown how they [could]\n   <em>\n    potentially\n   </em>\n   amend their complaint to state a valid claim under the joint employee doctrine.\" (\n   <em>\n    Morales, supra\n   </em>\n   , 1 Cal.App.5th at p. 543,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=206%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%201\">\n    206 Cal.Rptr.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , italics added.) However, for the reasons stated below, we now conclude that section 510, subdivision (a) does\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   require the DAA to pay its employees overtime compensation, and that is true whether the DAA is acting as plaintiffs'\n   <em>\n    sole\n   </em>\n   employer or plaintiffs'\n   <em>\n    joint\n   </em>\n   employer. Thus, the trial court properly sustained the DAA's demurrer to the second amended complaint.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   To begin with, we are aware of no authority, and plaintiffs have cited none, in either this appeal or in\n   <em>\n    Morales\n   </em>\n   , that supports the counterintuitive proposition that a public employee who is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   entitled to overtime compensation when employed\n   <em>\n    solely\n   </em>\n   by a public entity,\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   entitled to such overtime compensation\n   <em>\n    from the public en\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    tity\n   </em>\n   when the employee is\n   <em>\n    jointly\n   </em>\n   employed by the public entity and a private entity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   Further, there is nothing in the text of either section 510 or Wage Order No. 10 that would support such an anomalous result. Section 510, subdivision (a) makes no reference to public entities. As the\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   court observed, in the context of wage and hour provisions, \"the Legislature expressly refers to public entities when it intends them to be included.\" (\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 174 Cal.App.4th at p. 737,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=95%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%2053\">\n    95 Cal.Rptr.3d 53\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) Wage Order No. 10 in turn expressly \"exempts 'any employees directly employed by the State or any political subdivision thereof, including any city, county, or special district.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Morales\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 1 Cal.App.5th at p. 540,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=206%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%201\">\n    206 Cal.Rptr.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , quoting Cal. Code Regs., tit. 8, \u00a7 11100(1)(C).) Thus, there is nothing in the text of either section 510, subdivision (a) or Wage Order No. 10 that suggests that the DAA may be liable for overtime obligations when it acts as the plaintiffs'\n   <em>\n    joint\n   </em>\n   employer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Further, plaintiffs have offered no plausible reason why the DAA could nevertheless be liable for paying overtime compensation\n   <em>\n    pursuant to\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    section 510, subdivision (a)\n   </em>\n   , when the DAA jointly employs the plaintiffs with Outside Promoters. The plaintiffs contend that the\n   <em>\n    Morales\n   </em>\n   court must have concluded that \"[the DAA's] employees do not qualify as public employees performing exempt work when they are leased out to support private-sector businesses.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Italics &amp; boldface omitted.) This rationale might be plausible if\n   <em>\n    Morales\n   </em>\n   were based\n   <em>\n    solely\n   </em>\n   on the sovereign powers cannon of statutory construction.

We therefore see no basis for concluding that the applicability of the public employees' exemption from section 510, subdivision (a) turns on the type of work they are performing. Stated differently, we see no basis for concluding, as plaintiffs contend, that public employees are exempt from the overtime compensation mandates of section 510, subdivision (a) if the employees are performing work that furthers the DAA's sovereign purposes, but that such employees become entitled to overtime compensation if they are performing work that furthers the interests of \"Outside Promoters.\" On the contrary, as the\n   <em>\n    Morales\n   </em>\n   court concluded, without qualification, \"[P]ublic employees in the amusement and recreation industry are exempt from state overtime requirements.\" (\n   <em>\n    Morales\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 1 Cal.App.5th at p. 541,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=206%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%201\">\n    206 Cal.Rptr.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Finally, while both parties and the trial court extensively discussed\n   <em>\n    Noe, supra,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6055966\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/237/316/#p333\">\n    237 Cal.App.4th 316\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=187%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20836\">\n    187 Cal.Rptr.3d 836\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , we view that decision as inapposite because\n   <em>\n    Noe\n   </em>\n   did not involve, as does this case, a group of employees' section 1194, subdivision (a) claim against an employer based on a joint employment theory\n   <em>\n    where the employees are exempt from the Labor Code provision at issue\n   </em>\n   .

Further, plaintiffs asserted in their opening brief that \"the law-of-case doctrine is fully applicable ....\" In addition, plaintiffs' opening brief contained a section entitled, \"The court's holding in\n    <em>\n     Morales\n    </em>\n    .\" (Boldface &amp; some capitalization omitted.) In that section, plaintiffs argued that\n    <em>\n     Morales\n    </em>\n    established that \"[plaintiffs] then-proposed amendment would state a claim if joint employment were to be properly pleaded.\" Further, the DAA included a separately headed argument in its brief captioned, \"Law of the case doctrine is not applicable.\" (Some capitalization omitted.) Finally, plaintiffs offered a separately captioned law-of-the-case argument in their reply brief. Under these circumstances, we conclude that plaintiffs adequately raised the contention that the law-of-the-case doctrine requires reversal of the trial court's order.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"**\">\n   <p id=\"p-130\">\n    See footnote *,\n    <em>\n     ante\n    </em>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
