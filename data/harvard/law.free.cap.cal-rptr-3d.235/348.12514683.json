Before trial, defendant had entered pleas of no contest to two misdemeanor counts of possession of drug paraphernalia and driving with a suspended license. Defendant admitted certain recidivist allegations, and the trial court sustained the remainder. It then sentenced him to state prison for six years (after striking two of the recidivist findings).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On appeal, defendant claimed the trial court erroneously ignored his pretrial request to act in propria persona. He also contended that he received an unauthorized sentence, asserting that the trial court should have designated both of his felony convictions as misdemeanors and sentenced him accordingly, because the statutes on which these convictions are\n   based should be\n   <em>\n    deemed\n   </em>\n   to be included within the reach of a 2014 ballot proposition that reduced a number of offenses to misdemeanors (even though they are not expressly included in it).

The vehicle at issue in the two felony counts is a 1996 Pontiac Grand Am, the owner of which had given only his mother permission to use it. The car disappeared in December 2014 while in her possession without her permission. Of particular significance in light of\n   <em>\n    Page\n   </em>\n   , defendant was stopped while driving the car without license plates a week later, at which time he claimed to have received it from a third party. He reiterated this claim at trial. No evidence connected defendant directly with the taking of the car. At trial, the arresting officer never assigned a specific value to the car, but agreed with an assessment of it on a California Highway Patrol (CHP) form that it was low in value, within a range of $301 to $4,000 (the trial court excluding the form itself as hearsay).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   We will include facts pertinent to defendant's claim regarding self-representation in the Discussion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    1.0-1.2\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    **\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    2.0 The Vehicle Code Offense Must Be Tried with Correct Instructions, but Receipt of a Stolen Vehicle Is Not Subject to Misdemeanor Treatment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In November 2014, the electorate enacted the Safe Neighborhoods and Schools Act (Proposition 47), which redesignated a number of offenses as misdemeanors, and provided a procedure in section 1170.18 for retrospective comparable relief for defendants who were serving or had completed a sentence for a previous conviction that would have been a misdemeanor \"had this act been in effect at the time of the offense.\" ( \u00a7 1170.18, subds.

It accomplished the latter with the addition of section 490.2\" (which in subdivision (a) declares that obtaining\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   property worth $950 or less is a petty theft punishable as a misdemeanor), and \"additionally amended section 666 (also called 'petty theft with a prior') to allow wobbler punishment for recidivists who are otherwise disqualified from the reach of the initiative. Finally, it added the new misdemeanor of 'shoplifting' (\u00a7 459.5). (See Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec.

(a) ), the provisions of section 496 for misdemeanor sentencing apply as a matter of law to the more specific section 496d as well (and presumably sections 496a to 496c and 496e in addition). He alludes to the fact that section 490.2 does not identify every theft statute to which it applies (which\n   <em>\n    Page\n   </em>\n   found was not determinative with respect to its application to other theft statutes) and suggests that section 496 operates in the same manner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Section 490.2 contains key distinguishing introductory language: \"Notwithstanding Section 487\n   <em>\n    or any other provision of law\n   </em>\n   defining grand theft....\" (\u00a7 490.2, subd. (a), italics added.) Section 496 does not include any similar language indicating that its provisions are to apply to the entire subject of knowing receipt of stolen property. That the drafters of the proposition did not include a similar sweeping phrase in section 496 while placing one in section 490.2 is a strong signal that section 496 is not to operate in the same fashion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Defendant does not otherwise provide any authority for construing the terms of a general statute as controlling a more specific statute. Indeed, his argument is at odds with the interpretive maxim. A specific statute controls over a general conflicting statute even where the latter is the one later enacted. (\n   <em>\n    State Dept. of Public Health v. Superior Court\n   </em>\n   (2015)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3991329\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-4th/60/940/#p960\">\n    60 Cal.4th 940\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 960-961,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=184%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%2060\">\n    184 Cal.Rptr.3d 60\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=342%20P.3d%201217\">\n    342 P.3d 1217\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) Therefore, the misdemeanor treatment of violations of section 496 with respect to stolen property generally cannot be applied to section 496d or any of the other offenses in that series that apply to particular types of property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Defendant contends this violates principles of equal protection because there is an absence of any rational basis to treat a car thief under section 490.2 (and the statutes to which it applies) more leniently than a receiver of a stolen car. This is not a profitable line of argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \" '[N]either the existence of two identical criminal statutes prescribing different levels of punishments, nor the exercise of a prosecutor's discretion in charging under one statute and not the other, violates equal protection principles.'

Even a stolen car of low value can fuel a profitable illicit dismantling operation (the whole in this instance being less than the sum of its parts), and thus the receipt is more serious than the theft.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   As for the decision to treat section 496d violations differently than receiving stolen property generally under section 496, it is plausible that the drafters elected to proceed in an incremental way, gauging the effects of the proposition's sea change in penal law, and -in light of the small number of functioning vehicles worth under $950 at present values-did not consider it an injustice to fail to include them and instead leave the matter to the charging discretion of prosecutors.

Moreover, the drafters may rationally have believed harsher treatment was warranted because there are people who depend on this type of low-value vehicle for essential transportation that they could not otherwise afford.
