FRIEDMAN, District Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b63-19\">This matter is before the Court on the Supplemental Motion of Certain Plaintiffs to Modify Proposed Case Management Order No. 1 (the \u201cCMO Motion\u201d), and the Morgan Group\u2019s Response to Supplemental Motion of Certain Plaintiffs to Modify Case Management Order No. 1 (the \u201cCMO Response\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-20\">The CMO Motion was submitted jointly by the plaintiffs in most of the actions consolidated under this miscellaneous case number. This motion includes, and asks the Court to approve, a proposed case management order.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The proposed case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>management order would, among other things: (1) name Henry Sanders of Chestnut, Sanders, Sanders, Pettaway &amp; Campbell, L.L.C. and Andrew H. Marks of Cro-well &amp; Moring, L.L.P. as plaintiffs\u2019 eo-lead counsel; (2) name Laurel Pyke Malson of Crowell &amp; Moring, L.L.P. as plaintiffs\u2019 liaison counsel; (8) establish a steering committee of plaintiffs\u2019 counsel including Mr. Sanders, Harris L. Pogust of Pogust, Braslow <em>&amp; </em>Millrood, L.L.C., James Scott Farrin of the Law Offices of James Scott Farrin, and Scott Wm. Weinstein of Morgan &amp; Morgan, P.A.; and (4) require the plaintiffs\u2019 steering committee to create and manage an informational website and telephone bank for the benefit of all plaintiffs and potential plaintiffs. <em>See </em>CMO Mot. at 3-7.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">The CMO Response was submitted by plaintiffs in Civil Action No. 08-1188. These plaintiffs refer to themselves as \u201cthe Morgan Group\u201d \u2014 presumably because they are represented by Morgan &amp; Morgan, P.A. \u2014 and to the plaintiffs who joined the CMO Motion as \u201cthe Megagroup.\u201d The Morgan Group argues that <em>only </em>Mr. Marks should serve as plaintiffs\u2019 lead counsel. <em>See </em>CMO Resp. at 2. Alternatively, \u201cif it is the unstated goal [of the Mega-group] that an African American lawyer should share the [lead counsel] role with Mr. Marks,\u201d the Morgan Group argues that Mr. Marks, who is white, should share that role with Gregorio Francis of Morgan &amp; Morgan, P.A., who is African-American.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">The Court will not address the lead counsel dispute at this time because the latest proposed case management order\u2014 and particularly what is not included therein \u2014 raises more fundamental and pressing issues. As both groups know, this Court on more than one occasion has expressed its concerns about the management of these consolidated cases and the importance of transparency and uniformity on the issue of fees to be charged to plaintiffs and potential plaintiffs. In particular, the Court has expressed concerns about: (1) the dissemination of accurate and impartial information about these consolidated cases to all plaintiffs and potential plaintiffs; (2) the reasonableness and transparency of the attorneys\u2019 fee agreements offered to all plaintiffs and potential plaintiffs; (3) the consistency of attorneys\u2019 fee agreements across all firms involved in this case; (4) the role of the Court now and after settlement in assuring that all plaintiffs and potential plaintiffs are treated fairly and equally with respect to fees and costs (a role that, as the Court explained at the status conference, might be more robust and clearly defined if these actions were certified as class actions under Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure); and (5) the necessity of reassuring all plaintiffs and potential plaintiffs that \u201csigning up\u201d for these lawsuits will cost them nothing or close to it, and that any and all fees will come either because, at the end of the day, they are \u201cprevailing parties\u201d under the relevant statutes or, to some very minimal extent, to compensate counsel for management and implementation.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-11\">The Court expressly stated at the status conference on July 30, 2008 that the question of attorneys\u2019 fees must be \u201cresolve[d] up front,\u201d Transcript of Hearing at 17 (July 30, 2008) (\u201cTranscript\u201d), \u201cbefore I decide who\u2019s going to be lead class counsel and who\u2019s going to be [on the] executive committee.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 20. The Court assumed, in light of the concerns it expressed, that any proposed case manage<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>ment order would address this issue. The Court further observed at the status conference:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-5\">We\u2019ve got a statute which provides attorneys\u2019 fees to the prevailing party. Now why doesn\u2019t every lawyer in this case reach the same agreement up front? Now, if you want to have a little bit in a kitty to deal with implementation because we had some problems on whether you get paid for the implementation phase versus the prevailing plaintiff phase, f\u00edne.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-6\">And you all ought to resolve [the attorneys\u2019 fees issue] up front. I\u2019ve seen the Web sites of some of the law firms, and I don\u2019t like them. I don\u2019t like people saying it\u2019s going to cost you a third of your relief, whatever I get for you, or 20 percent of your relief, whatever I get for you, because that\u2019s not what Congress had in mind.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-7\">Congress had in mind to try to take these 63,000 people who I wouldn\u2019t let in to <em>Pigford </em>because they were late, and let them in. And let\u2019s go back and pretend that we\u2019re back on day one, say to them, you get what everybody else got. That\u2019s what I think Congress intended, and if that\u2019s what Congress intended, it\u2019s $55,000 plus debt relief plus tax relief. It all goes to the farmer. And then [the attorneys] file attorneys\u2019 fees claims.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-8\">To me, it\u2019s very important that this remain a class action until we know what mechanism is in place. It\u2019s very important that we have the same rules or very similar rules to the rules that governed in <em>Pigford, </em>if we\u2019re going to try to put everybody back in a position that they were in before.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-9\">So, what I\u2019m concerned about when I say \u2014 this is just one example \u2014 that you all need to get on the same page about what you want to do about legal fees, is because it\u2019s how [plaintiffs and potential plaintiffs are] going to react. You know, you and I and Ms. Malson and Mr. Fraas, we\u2019re Washington lawyers, and we\u2019re suspected by lots of people, and certainly by black farmers in the South, and they\u2019re not going to understand if somebody gets $10,000 less than the next guy when the case is settled or resolved in some fashion, unless there\u2019s \u2014 even if there\u2019s a rational explanation, but certainly if it\u2019s because one lawyer took a little more money or was paid a little more money than another lawyer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-11\">[I]t wasn\u2019t perfect, but over time there was a level of credibility that came from [the settlement in the original <em>Pigford </em>case] that is so important going forward. And at the end of the day it may not matter whether the settlement or the solution [in these consolidated cases] looks like this ... or looks like that, but there\u2019s got to be some consistency and some rationality and some feeling that, you know, we were all treated equally [and] fairly_So, the legal fees question is an example of that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b65-13\">Transcript at 17-23. Frankly, these concerns have only been heightened in the Court\u2019s mind since the passing of Mr. Chestnut, who demonstrated a unique ability in <em>Pigford </em>to communicate with members of the class, African-American farmers in the South.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-14\">The Court will not approve a proposed case management order unless it adequately addresses these issues. In addition, any proposed case management order should: (1) specify the attorneys\u2019 fees to be charged to plaintiffs; (2) provide a representative fee agreement for the Court\u2019s review; (3) require all firms to charge the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>same attorneys\u2019 fees (or explain why this should not be the case); and (4) otherwise persuade this Court that there are mechanisms in place to assure all plaintiffs and potential plaintiffs that the matter of attorneys\u2019 fees will be handled in a fair, transparent, uniform and readily comprehensible manner. The Court therefore will deny all pending motions for the entry of a case management order and direct counsel to meet and confer about the issues identified above.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">As the Court was preparing this Memorandum Opinion and Order, the plaintiffs filed a motion for an immediate status conference, noting that they have received distressing reports over the last few weeks concerning \u201cunscrupulous individuals and groups [that] have been making grossly distorted representations within the African-American farmers community regarding the potential rights of African-American farmers to seek relief\u2019 in these cases, and information suggesting that some African-American farmers are being taken advantage of by being charged a \u201csign up\u201d fee for participation in this lawsuit. Plaintiffs\u2019 Motion for Immediate Status Conference at 2. Plaintiffs cited a number of examples of incidents that gave them concern. Like the plaintiffs, this Court finds reports of such incidents, if true, \u201cextremely troubling.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">For those lawyers who have been involved in the <em>Pigford </em>litigation (Ms. Sanders, Mr. Sanders, Mr. Fraas and Mr. Frantz), these incidents should come as no surprise. Similar things occurred in <em>Pig-ford, </em>and counsel, with the assistance of the court-appointed monitor, had to develop methods to deal with them. The Court would have thought that counsel would have anticipated such possibilities. Furthermore, in view of the Court\u2019s statements at the July 30 status conference concerning possible transmission of misinformation relating to this case, <em>see </em>Transcript at 8-9, the Court assumed that by now, with or without a case management order in place, counsel would have consulted at length with the court-appointed monitor in <em>Pigford </em>as to how she dealt with these and various other circumstances that might be expected to arise in this case as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-8\">In view of the foregoing, the Court will schedule a status conference to further discuss the issues discussed in this Memorandum Opinion and Order. After that status conference, the parties will be required to submit a new proposed case management order. Accordingly, it is hereby</p>\n<p id=\"b66-9\">ORDERED that Plaintiffs\u2019 Motion to Modify Proposed Case Management Order No. 1 and Memorandum in Support [6] is DENIED as moot; it is</p>\n<p id=\"b66-10\">FURTHER ORDERED that the Supplemental Motion of Certain Plaintiffs to Modify Proposed Case Management Order No. 1[13] is DENIED; it is</p>\n<p id=\"b66-11\">FURTHER ORDERED that Plaintiffs\u2019 Motion for Immediate Status Conference [18] is GRANTED; and it is</p>\n<p id=\"b66-12\">FURTHER ORDERED that a status conference is scheduled for November 14, 2008 at 10:00 a.m. At that status conference, the parties should be prepared to discuss how they plan to craft a new proposed case management order and, if necessary, take additional steps to address the Court\u2019s concerns.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b66-13\">SO ORDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b63-13\">. The proposed case management order appended to the CMO Motion modifies slightly an earlier proposed case management order submitted by the same group of plaintiffs on August 22, 2008. The proposed case management order submitted on August 22, 2008, in turn, modifies slightly an earlier proposed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>case management order submitted on July 24, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-8\">The only material difference between the latest proposed case management order and the one submitted on August 22, 2008 is the proposed substitution of Henry Sanders for J.L. Chestnut as co-lead counsel. Mr. Chestnut passed away on September 30, 2008.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b66-6\">. The parties should also be prepared to discuss whether they have engaged in further discussions about the lead counsel dispute, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>and if so, whether they have made any progress on that front.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
