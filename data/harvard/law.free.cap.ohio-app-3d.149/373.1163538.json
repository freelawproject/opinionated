Celebrezze, Jr., Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b407-15\">{\u00b6 1} The' appellants, Khaled Tabbaa and Deema Tabbaa, appeal the judgment of the trial court in adopting terms for a settlement agreement. For the reasons set forth below, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-16\">{\u00b6 2} This case is based on an original action between the appellants and the appellees, John C. Koglman, trustee of the Koglman Family Trust, and Irene Koglman. The Tabbaas, lessees of appellees\u2019 commercial building, brought an action against appellees asserting claims for breach of the lease and various other claims. Appellees then counterclaimed against the Tabbaas for breach of the lease agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-17\">{\u00b6 3} This matter went to trial, which resulted in a jury verdict in favor of the appellees and an award of $225,000 based on their counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-18\">{\u00b6 4} On August 17, 2001, in an effort to aid in the execution of the jury award, the Koglmans filed an \u201cAffidavit and Order and Notice of Garnishment\u201d with the Cleveland Municipal Court. During post-trial motions, the parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>entered into a settlement agreement before the trial court on August 20, 2001. At the hearing, the terms of the settlement were put forth on the record:</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">{\u00b6 5} \u201cMr. Corrado [counsel for Tabbaa]: The agreement for settlement is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">{\u00b6 6} \u201cThe plaintiffs will pay the Koglman Family Trust the sum of three hundred thousand dollars on or before October 4, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cAlong with the settlement, the Koglman Family Trust will retain the security deposit that it has from the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cAnd the Koglman Family Trust will retain any and all equipment that currently resides in the building at the premises that was in question here.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-9\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cThe Court: The equipment and any fixtures that may be in the building?</p>\n<p id=\"b408-10\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cMr. Corrado: Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-11\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cThe Court: And the amount of the security deposit was ten thousand dollars of which the Koglman Family Trust will retain?</p>\n<p id=\"b408-12\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cMr. Corrado: Yes sir. And then to move along here, the parties will split the cost of this lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-13\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cAnd both the parties have represented to each other that they have no bill of costs that they are going to submit to the clerk\u2019s office as part of this litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-14\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cAnd the parties will execute a full release of all of the parties that were in the suit and their attorneys.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-15\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cAnd we will be filing an entry of settlement with the Court, which will state that this case has been settled and dismissed with prejudice, and the parties to split costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-16\">{\u00b6 16} \u201cAnd that your Honor has asked us to try and get that done by the end of this week.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-17\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cAnd everything is dismissed with prejudice, and all current and pending matters, as well as anything else.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b408-18\">{\u00b6 18} The next day, August 21, 2001, the Cleveland Municipal Court garnished one or more bank accounts over which Khaled Tabbaa was listed, as having control. The total amount garnished by the court was $36,713.19.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-19\">{\u00b6 19} After the garnishment action, attorney Corrado refused to allow the signing of the settlement agreement and release because of the addition of parties and terms that would prohibit all future actions based on the appellees\u2019 garnishment action. This matter remained unresolved, and the Tabbaas did not render <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>payment of the $300,000 as had been promised pursuant to the settlement agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">{\u00b6 20} Both sides then filed motions requesting enforcement of the settlement agreement. On October 16, 2001, this matter came before the trial court on the motions, and the trial court issued a journal entry that ordered the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">{\u00b6 21} \u201c1. On August 20, 2001, the parties reached a settlement agreement in the presence of the Court and recited the terms of the Settlement Agreement upon the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">{\u00b6 22} \u201c2. The Settlement Agreement and Release attached hereto fairly and accurately encompass the material terms of the Settlement Agreement that the parties reached on August 20, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">{\u00b6 23} \u201c3. Any additional provisions contained in the attached Settlement Agreement and Release are ordered by the Court as being fair and equitable and within the Court\u2019s discretion in the enforcement of the August 20, 2001 Settlement Agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b409-9\">{\u00b6 24} The appellants now appeal the actions of the trial court and assert the following two assignments of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b409-10\">{\u00b6 25} \u201cI. The court abused its discretion and committed prejudicial error by adding new and different terms to a previously entered into settlement agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b409-11\">{\u00b6 26} \u201cII. The court erred in not holding an evidentiary hearing on the disputed facts in the settlement agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b409-12\">{\u00b6 27} Appellants\u2019 two assignments of error will be combined for purposes of review because they represent elements of the same argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-13\">{\u00b6 28} The appellants contend in their first assignment of error that the trial court abused its discretion when it enforced a settlement agreement that included additional terms and parties not agreed to by the appellants in the original settlement agreement. In their second assignment of error, the appellants maintain that because of facts in dispute, the trial court was required to conduct an evidentiary hearing regarding the disputed facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-14\">{\u00b6 29} Initially, this court recognizes that a trial court possesses the authority to enforce a settlement agreement voluntarily entered into by the parties to a lawsuit. <em>Mack v. Polson Rubber Co. </em>(1984), 14 Ohio St.3d 34, 14 OBR 335, 470 N.E.2d 902. However, a trial court will lose jurisdiction to proceed in a matter when the court has unconditionally dismissed an action. <em>State ex rel. Rice v. McGrath </em>(1991), 62 Ohio St.3d 70, 577 N.E.2d 1100. In contrast, \u201c[w]hen an action is dismissed pursuant to a stated condition, such as the existence of a settlement agreement, the court retains the authority to enforce such an agree<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>ment in the event the condition does not occur.\u201d <em>Berger v. Riddle </em>(Aug. 18, 1994), Cuyahoga App. Nos. 66195 and 66200, 1994 WL 449397. \u201cThe determination of whether a dismissal is unconditional, thus depriving a court of jurisdiction to entertain a motion to enforce a settlement agreement, is dependent upon the terms of the dismissal order.\u201d <em>Le-Air Molded Plastics, Inc. v. Goforth </em>(Feb. 24, 2000), Cuyahoga App. No. 74543, 2000 WL 218385, citing <em>Showcase Homes, Inc. v. Ravenna Sav. Bank </em>(1998), 126 Ohio App.3d 328, 710 N.E.2d 347.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">{\u00b6 30} In the case sub judice, the docket reflects that a hearing was held on August 20, 2001, at which the parties orally agreed to settle the case and recorded parts of the settlement on the record. Following this hearing, the trial court issued a journal entry that settled and dismissed the case and called for a written settlement agreement and release to be submitted to the court later. Therefore, the dismissal was based upon the parties\u2019 completion of a condition- \u2014 -a settlement and release. Since the focus of this appeal is on the court\u2019s acceptance of the appellees\u2019 proposed settlement agreement and release, the trial court therefore maintains jurisdiction to entertain a motion to enforce the settlement agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">{\u00b6 31} The standard of review this court must apply to the actions of the trial court in this case is abuse of discretion. See <em>Hillbrook Bldg. Co. v. Corporate Wings, Inc. </em>(Sept. 5, 1996), Cuyahoga App. No. 68619, 1996 WL 502157. \u201cThe term \u2018abuse of discretion\u2019 connotes more than an error of law or judgment; it implies that the court\u2019s attitude is unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable.\u201d <em>Blakemore v. Blakemore </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 5 OBR 481, 450 N.E.2d 1140. Therefore, in the absence of an abuse of discretion, this court may not disturb the judgment of the lower court. <em>Tracy v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc. </em>(1991), 58 Ohio St.3d 147, 569 N.E.2d 875.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">{\u00b6 32} In the instant case, the appellants contend that the action of the trial court amounted to an abuse of discretion when the court failed to hold an evidentiary hearing on the addition of new parties and terms in the revised settlement agreement and release proposed by the appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">{\u00b6 33} \u201cWhere the parties in an action * * * voluntarily enter into an oral settlement agreement in the presence of the court, [the] agreement constitutes a binding [and enforceable] contract.\u201d <em>Spercel v. Sterling Industries </em>(1972), 31 Ohio St.2d 36, 60 O.O.2d 20, 285 N.E.2d 324, paragraph one of the syllabus. In addition, \u201c[a]n oral settlement agreement requires no more formality and no greater particularity than appears in the law for the formation of a binding contract.\u201d <em>Hillbrook, </em>supra, at 10; citing <em>Rodgers v. Rodgers </em>(May 7, 1987) Cuyahoga App. No. 52015, 1987 WL 11192. The agreement need not be in writing and no funds need be exchanged in order to establish the existence of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>settlement contract. <em>Walland v. Rinehart </em>(Mar. 26, 1987), Cuyahoga App. Nos 51935 and 52672; See <em>Mack v. Polson Rubber Co. </em>(1984), 14 Ohio St.3d 34, 14 OBR 335, 470 N.E.2d 902. \u201cShort of laboriously hammering out a handwritten agreement in court the preferred process is to agree to settle on condition that the language (rather than the terms themselves) can be agreed to in the near future * * *. In the event that a party fails to make a good faith attempt to agree on the language the trial judge can (after hearing) determine the terms and construct a reasonable journal entry outlining the agreement.\u201d <em>Tepper v. Heck </em>(Dec. 10, 1992), Cuyahoga App. No. 61061, 1992 WL 369283. Therefore, the trial court is required to hold an evidentiary hearing when the party opposing the agreement alleges fraud, duress, undue influence, or any other factual dispute concerning the existence of the terms of a settlement agreement. <em>Grubic v. Grubic </em>(Sept. 9, 1999), Cuyahoga App. No. 73793, 1999 WL 703053, citing <em>Morform Tool Corp. v. Keco Industries, Inc. </em>(1971), 30 Ohio App.2d 207, 59 O.O.2d 320, 284 N.E.2d 191.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">{\u00b6 34} In the case sub judice, the appellants maintain that there are factual disputes as to the terms of the agreement, namely, the scope of the release as to future actions against the appellees and the identity of those parties who are precluded from relitigation under the court-ordered release, as well as a question as to the inclusion of indemnification in the release.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">{\u00b6 35} Whether or not this court agrees with the final determination of the trial court and its conclusion that the submitted settlement agreement and release accurately represent the material terms set forth by the parties in their August 20, 2001 settlement agreement, the trial court failed to conduct the necessary hearing as warranted by the disputed terms. Although the appellees may maintain that a hearing was conducted in chambers, at which appellant\u2019s counsel stated that they did not need to go on record, there were later assertions made by the appellants that there was in fact no hearing regarding the settlement terms. Therefore, the trial court abused its discretion in failing to conduct a hearing before rendering judgment on the proposed settlement agreement and release.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b411-8\">Colleen Conway Cooney and Diane Karpinski, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
