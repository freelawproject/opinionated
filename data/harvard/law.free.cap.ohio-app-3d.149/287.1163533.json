McMonagle, Administrative Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b320-12\">{\u00b6 1} Relator requested permission to review and copy the contents of a file in the custody of respondent Clerk of the Shaker Heights Municipal Court. In relator\u2019s presence, the court\u2019s bailiff was instructed by the prosecutor to remove \u201ca yellow legal sized note sheet\u201d containing the notes of the judge of that court before the bailiff handed the file to relator. On a later occasion, respondent refused to permit relator to review the judge\u2019s notes. Relator requests that, under R.C. 149.43 (Ohio\u2019s public records law), this court issue a writ of mandamus compelling respondent to permit relator to inspect and copy \u201cthe complete file(s)\u201d maintained by respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-13\">{\u00b6 2} Respondent has filed a motion to dismiss and argues that the judge\u2019s notes are not public records. Relator has opposed the motion to dismiss and argues that, because the judge\u2019s notes were in the court file, relator is entitled to inspect and copy the notes. For the reasons stated below, we grant the motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-14\">{\u00b6 3} In <em>State ex rel. Steffen v. Kraft </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 439, 619 N.E.2d 688, the Supreme Court affirmed the judgment of the Court of Appeals for Hamilton County, dismissing an action in mandamus seeking access to the personal trial notes of the respondent judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-15\">{\u00b6 4} \u201cA trial judge\u2019s personal handwritten notes made during the course of a trial are not public records. <em>State ex rel. Mothers Against Drunk Drivers v. Gosser </em>(1985), 20 Ohio St.3d 30, 32, 20 OBR 279, 281, 485 N.E.2d 706, 709, fn. 2; <em>State ex rel. Martinelli v. Corrigan </em>(1991), 71 Ohio App.3d 243, 593 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>N.E.2d 364.\u201d Id. at 439, 619 N.E.2d 688. Despite the <em>Steffen </em>court\u2019s reaffirming the holding of <em>Gosser, </em>relator argues that the following portion of the <em>Steffen </em>opinion requires that this court hold that the \u201cyellow legal sized note sheet\u201d is a public record.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">{\u00b6 5} \u201c[A judge\u2019s personal handwritten trial] notes are simply personal papers kept for the judge\u2019s own convenience and not official records. Steffen has not asserted that other court officials had access to or used the notes, nor does Steffen assert the clerk of courts had custody of the notes as official records. See R.C. 2303.09 and 2303.14.\u201d <em>Steffen, </em>supra, at 440, 619 N.E.2d 688.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">{\u00b6 6} That is, relator would have this court hold that the presence of the \u201cyellow legal sized note sheet\u201d in the case file retained by the clerk is the dispositive fact. Although the <em>Steffen </em>court indicated that the absence of the notes from the clerk\u2019s file was one indicator that the notes were not public records, reading <em>Steffen </em>in its entirety requires that we conclude that the complaint in this action fails to state a claim for relief in mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">{\u00b6 7} \u201c[Permitting a litigant access to a judge\u2019s personal trial notes would intrude upon a judge\u2019s subjective thoughts and deliberations, threatening the orderly administration of justice. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cThus, if R.C. 149.43 were interpreted to mandate public access to a trial judge\u2019s personal notes, that result could be construed as an unconstitutional legislative encroachment upon the independence of the judiciary.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">{\u00b6 9} Indeed, the portion of <em>Steffen </em>on which relator relies reinforces this conclusion. For example, relator does not aver that the judge\u2019s notes were delivered to the clerk to be filed with and preserved by the court. See R.C. 2303.09, which the Supreme Court cited in <em>Steffen. </em>See, also, R.C. 1901.31(E), governing clerks of municipal courts, which provides in part: \u201cThe clerk shall do all of the following: file and safely keep all journals, records, books, and papers belonging or appertaining to the court * * *.\u201d In light of the Supreme Court\u2019s clear statement that the judge\u2019s handwritten trial notes \u201care simply personal papers,\u201d we cannot conclude that relief in mandamus is appropriate. Compare <em>State ex rel. Murray v. Netting </em>(Sept. 18, 1998), Guernsey App. No. 97-CA-24, 1998 WL 666742 (the mere fact that the handwritten notes of interviewers of candidates for chief of police were in the custody of the mayor did not make the notes public records).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-9\">{\u00b6 10} Accordingly, respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss is granted. Relator to pay costs. The clerk is directed to serve upon the parties notice of this judgment and its date of entry upon the journal. Civ.R. 58(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-10\">Petition dismissed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b321-11\">Michael J. Corrigan and Frank D. Celebrezze, Jr., JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
