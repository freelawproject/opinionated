Plaintiff and Manning have never been married. Plaintiff is employed as a real estate agent and has been involved with and supported Chaz since his birth. In 1999 and 2000, plaintiff and Manning had agreed upon a childcare schedule that called for plaintiff to care for Chaz on the weekends, as Manning worked weekends. Under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>the agreed-upon schedule, plaintiff would pick Chaz up from daycare at \u201cDowntown Playschool\u201d on Thursday or Friday afternoon and would then care for Chaz until Monday morning, when he dropped him off at daycare. Plaintiffs pickup schedule varied every other week between Thursday and Friday because the childcare plan called for plaintiff to take Chaz to get his haircut every other Thursday.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">{\u00b6 3} In 1999, plaintiff filed an action in which he sought to obtain legal custody of Chaz. In April 1999, a magistrate issued a decision recommending that a shared parenting plan proposed by plaintiff be adopted and that plaintiff be designated the custodial and residential parent of Chaz. However, the entry journalizing the magistrate\u2019s recommendation was not filed until May 10, 2000. In Ohio, an unwed mother is designated the child\u2019s sole residential parent and legal custodian by operation of law until a court issues an order designating someone else as the child\u2019s residential parent and legal custodian. R.C. 3109.042. Thus, until May 10, 2000, plaintiffs right to visitation with Chaz was subject to Manning\u2019s granting permission for such visitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">{\u00b6 4} On Wednesday, April 26, 2000, Manning presented a notarized letter to Chaz\u2019s daycare instructing the daycare not to release Chaz into his father\u2019s custody. However, Manning allegedly failed to notify plaintiff of this change. When plaintiff arrived at Chaz\u2019s daycare to pick Chaz up on Thursday, May 4, 2000, the school released the boy to his father despite Manning\u2019s notarized letter. When Manning arrived at the preschool sometime later, she learned that plaintiff had already picked Chaz up. Later that evening, Manning telephoned WBNS 10TV, stating that her son\u2019s preschool had permitted plaintiff to pick up her son over her written instructions and that she had been unable to locate her son since that time. On May 5 and 6, 2000, WBNS 10TV broadcast a story during its newscasts which characterized plaintiffs conduct in picking Chaz up from preschool as an \u201cabduction.\u201d The broadcast was as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">{\u00b6 5} \u201c[Anchor Angela Pace]: He was just another little boy in a Columbus Day Care Center. But tonight two-year old Chaz Holley is a statistic ... one of the two-thousand children abducted everyday in the United States. And this time, the daycare administrators admit it was their fault. New at 11, Penny Moore joins us with a mother\u2019s search for her missing son. Penny?</p>\n<p id=\"b56-8\">{\u00b6 6} \u201c[Reporter Penny Moore]: Chaz Holley\u2019s mother was afraid the little boy would be snatched by his father, even though she has full custody. So she took the steps she was told would keep that from happening. But tonight she is alone and her new mission is finding Chaz.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-9\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cAnika Manning thought her son was perfectly safe with the other children at this daycare ... until she went to pick him up yesterday afternoon.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>{\u00b6 8} \u201c[Mother, Anika Manning]: I was looking for him and the teacher said Chaz is already gone.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">{\u00b6 9} \u201c[Reporter Penny Moore]: The daycare teacher had released Chaz to his father ... Dennis Holley ... in spite of this notarized letter in the file saying not to let the father pick him up under any circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">{\u00b6 10} \u201c[Mother, Anika Manning]: I told both teachers not to let them take him and then I talked to the director and did the paperwork.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">{\u00b6 11} \u201c[Reporter Penny Moore]: We asked the daycare administrators for an explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-8\">{\u00b6 12} \u201c[Representative of Downtown Playschool]: There was a miscom-munication in the file and the teacher didn\u2019t have the letter and I assumed the teacher had the letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-9\">{\u00b6 13} \u201c[Reporter Penny Moore]: Tonight, Chaz is nowhere to be found ... his father\u2019s apartment has been empty all evening ... he\u2019s had the phone number changed ... but late tonight ... Anika was able to reach him on his cell phone.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-10\">{\u00b6 14} \u201c[Mother, Anika Manning]: You don\u2019t go to school and take him .. . I always do that ... you knew you weren\u2019t allowed to pick him up.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-11\">{\u00b6 15} \u201c[Reporter Penny Moore]: Dennis Holley wouldn\u2019t say where he has the boy.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-12\">{\u00b6 16} \u201c And Ollie Hawes says the Downtown Playschool is no place for a child in the middle of a custody battle.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-13\">{\u00b6 17} \u201c[Representative of Downtown Playschool]: We\u2019re not a police force we can\u2019t handle this ... find another center. We can\u2019t deal with a situation like this.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-14\">{\u00b6 18} \u201c[Reporter Penny Moore]: Will Anika Manning find her son ... she is surprisingly optimistic.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-15\">{\u00b6 19} \u201c[Mother, Anika Manning]: I know he doesn\u2019t want the responsibility of the child. He\u2019s just trying to spite me. He\u2019s just mad at me.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-16\">{\u00b6 20} \u201c[Anchor Tino Ramos]: So why can\u2019t the police help find Chaz for his mother?</p>\n<p id=\"b57-17\">{\u00b6 21} \u201cBecause Columbus Police do not search for children in custody cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-18\">{\u00b6 22} \u201cThe mother must first locate Chaz, then police may ask the father to return him.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-19\">{\u00b6 23} \u201cIt is also up to the mother to file charges against the father. Anika Manning says she now plans to do that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>{\u00b6 24} On July 19, 2000, plaintiff filed a complaint against defendant in the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas alleging that he had been defamed by the news broadcast that indicated that he had abducted his son. On May 23, 2001, defendant moved for summary judgment on plaintiffs defamation claim. The trial court granted defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Appellant appeals from the judgment of the trial court assigning the following errors:</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">First Assignment of Error</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">{\u00b6 25} \u201cThe trial court committed prejudicial error in granting defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment when genuine issues of material fact remain in dispute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">Second Assignment of Error</p>\n<p id=\"b58-8\">{\u00b6 26} \u201cThe trial court erred in granting defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment when it failed to construe the evidence most strongly in favor of the nonmoving party.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b58-9\">{\u00b6 27} We will address plaintiffs two assignments of error together, as both challenge the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment for defendant. Because this matter arises in the context of the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment pursuant to Civ.R. 56, we review the trial court\u2019s determination independently and without deference. <em>Brown v. Scioto Cty. Bd. of Commrs. </em>(1993), 87 Ohio App.3d 704, 711, 622 N.E.2d 1153. In conducting our review, we apply the same standard as the trial court. <em>Maust v. Bank One Columbus, N.A. </em>(1992), 83 Ohio App.3d 103, 107, 614 N.E.2d 765.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-10\">{\u00b6 28} In accordance with Civ.R. 56, summary judgment may be granted only if, viewing the evidence most strongly in favor of the nonmoving party, no genuine issue of fact exists, the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and reasonable minds can only come to a conclusion which is adverse to the nonmoving party. <em>Harless v. Willis Day Warehousing Co. </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 64, 8 O.O.3d 73, 375 N.E.2d 46. A motion for summary judgment first forces the moving party to inform the court of the basis of the motion and to identify portions in the record that demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. <em>Dresher v. Burt </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 280, 296, 662 N.E.2d 264. If the moving party makes that showing, the nonmoving party then must produce evidence on any issue for which the party bears the burden of production at trial. <em>Wing v. Anchor Media, Ltd. of Texas </em>(1991), 59 Ohio St.3d 108, 570 N.E.2d 1095, paragraph three of the syllabus <em>(Celotex Corp. v. Catrett </em>[1986], 477 U.S. 317, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265, approved and followed).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-11\">{\u00b6 29} In both of his assignments of error, plaintiff argues that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment for defendant on his defamation claim. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>Defamation is the publication of a false statement of fact that injures a person\u2019s reputation, exposes him to public hatred, contempt, ridicule, shame or disgrace, or affects him adversely in his trade or business. <em>Sweitzer v. Outlet Communications, Inc. </em>(1999), 133 Ohio App.3d 102, 108-111, 726 N.E.2d 1084. There are two forms of defamation: libel and slander. Generally, slander refers to spoken defamatory words and libel refers to written defamatory words. <em>Retterer v. Whirlpool Corp. </em>(1996), 111 Ohio App.3d 847, 857, 677 N.E.2d 417. However, the Restatement provides that a defamatory matter broadcast by means of radio or television is classified as libel. 3 Restatement of the Law 2d, Torts (1977), Section 568A. See <em>Perez v. Scripps-Howard Broadcasting Co. </em>(1988), 35 Ohio St.3d 215, 520 N.E.2d 198 (wherein the court used the term libel in referring to a defamation action arising out of a television news broadcast).</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">{\u00b6 30} In order to prevail on a claim for libel, it must be shown that (1) a false statement of fact was made concerning the plaintiff; (2) the statement was defamatory; (3) the statement was written and published, or broadcast by means of television or radio; and (4) in publishing or broadcasting the statement, the defendant acted with the necessary degree of fault. See <em>Sethi v. WFMJ Television, Inc. </em>(1999), 134 Ohio App.3d 796, 732 N.E.2d 451 (applying the traditional libel standard to a television broadcast). Where, as here, the plaintiff is a private person, Ohio law requires that the plaintiff establish by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant failed to act reasonably in attempting to discover the truth or falsity of the allegedly defamatory statement. <em>Lansdowne v. Beacon Journal Publishing Co. </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 176, 180, 512 N.E.2d 979.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">{\u00b6 31} The trial court granted summary judgment for defendant based on its conclusion that the evidence submitted by the parties did not present a question of fact on the issue of fault, but, instead, established as a matter of law that defendant acted reasonably in attempting to discover the truth or falsity of Manning\u2019s report that plaintiff had abducted Chaz. Defendant contends that the trial court erred in reaching this conclusion because, in so doing, it failed to construe the evidence most strongly in his favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">{\u00b6 32} Because we conclude that the innocent construction rule protects defendant from liability in this case, we do not reach the question of whether defendant acted reasonably in attempting to determine the truth or falsity of its story. The Ohio Supreme Court adopted the innocent construction rule in <em>Yeager v. Local Union 20 </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St.3d 369, 372, 6 OBR 421, 453 N.E.2d 666. See <em>Sweitzer, </em>133 Ohio App.3d at 112, 726 N.E.2d 1084 (indicating that <em>Yeager </em>has been so construed). The innocent construction rule is that, if a statement is reasonably susceptible of both a defamatory and an innocent meaning, the innocent meaning is to be adopted as a matter of law. <em>Yeager </em>at 372, 453 N.E.2d 666. \u201c[A]n innocent construction requires a fair reading of the entire article <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>which gives the words their meaning. Isolated words * * * may not be taken out of context.\u201d <em>Crinkley v. Dow Jones &amp; Co., Inc. </em>(1983), 119 Ill.App.3d 147, 152, 74 Ill.Dec. 636, 640, 456 N.E.2d 138, 142.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">{\u00b6 33} It is clear that the term \u201cabduction\u201d may have a false and defamatory meaning in the present case. Defendant argues that the term necessarily connotes the commission of a crime similar to kidnapping. Even if this is not true, the term is susceptible of a meaning that makes defendant\u2019s broadcast defamatory. Webster\u2019s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary (1988) 44, defines the term \u201cabduct\u201d to mean \u201cto carry away by force.\u201d No one contends that defendant took Chaz from his daycare by force. Nonetheless, if the term \u201cabduction\u201d has an alternative meaning that renders defendant\u2019s broadcast true and, thus, not defamatory, plaintiffs cause of action must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">{\u00b6 34} The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children has defined the term \u201cabducted child\u201d to mean a \u201cchild who has been wrongfully taken, kept, or concealed.\u201d National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, Family Abduction: How to Prevent Abduction and What to Do If Your Child is Abducted (4th Ed.1994), at xi. The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children also defines the term \u201cfamily abduction\u201d as <em>\u201cthe taking, </em>keeping, or concealing <em>of a child by a parent, </em>other family member, or person acting on behalf of the parent or family member <em>which deprives another individual of his or her rights. Also called </em>parental kidnapping, child snatching, or <em>custodial interference.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Id. In addition, at least two Ohio cases suggest that the term \u201cabduction\u201d is an appropriate term to use when referring to a noncustodial parent\u2019s improper exercise of custody over a child. <em>Stokes v. Meimaris </em>(1996), 111 Ohio App.3d 176, 189, 675 N.E.2d 1289 (police officer testified that it was appropriate to use the term \u201cabduction\u201d to describe a noncustodial parent\u2019s taking of a child); <em>In re Markham </em>(1990), 70 Ohio App.3d 841, 845, 592 N.E.2d 896 (court uses the term \u201cabduction\u201d to describe situation where one parent wrongfully takes custody of a child). In this case, although plaintiff does assert that he was not aware that Manning had withdrawn her permission for him to pick Chaz up from daycare, he does not dispute the fact that such permission had been withdrawn by virtue of Manning\u2019s notarized letter to the daycare facility. Because plaintiff was without permission to pick Chaz up at daycare, he had no right to custody of Chaz and his actions in exercising such custody were technically improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">{\u00b6 35} Applying the innocent construction rule to defendant\u2019s story regarding plaintiffs abduction of his son, there is no genuine issue of fact but that the import of the story taken as a whole is that plaintiff obtained and exercised custody over the boy when he had no right to do so, rather than that plaintiff kidnapped or took the child by force. Because plaintiff did, in fact, pick up and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>keep his son when he technically had no right to do so, the story aired by defendant was essentially true. Given that a reasonable innocent construction of defendant\u2019s story exists, that construction must be adopted as a matter of law. <em>Yeager, </em>6 Ohio St.3d at 372, 453 N.E.2d 666; <em>Sweitzer, </em>133 Ohio App.3d at 112, 726 N.E.2d 1084.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">{\u00b6 36} Relying on the Third Appellate District\u2019s recent decision in <em>Gupta v. The Lima News </em>(2000), 139 Ohio App.3d 538, 547, 744 N.E.2d 1207, plaintiff argues that the question of whether an innocent or defamatory meaning of a statement is to be adopted is a question of fact which must be submitted to the jury. The discussion of the innocent construction rule in <em>Gupta </em>is dicta, as the court ultimately determined that no reasonable, innocent construction of the statement at issue in the case existed. However, to the extent that <em>Gupta </em>suggests that the innocent construction rule gives rise to a question of fact, rather than law, we believe the case was wrongly decided. In fact, a review of the authority relied upon in <em>Gupta </em>for the proposition that the innocent construction rule creates an issue of fact suggests that the <em>Gupta </em>court was confusing the innocent construction rule with the concept of \u201cdefamation per quod.\u201d See <em>Becker v. Toulmin </em>(1956), 165 Ohio St. 549, 556, 60 O.O. 502, 138 N.E.2d 391 (holding that, in an action for libel per quod, the question of whether a statement that is not defamatory on its face is nonetheless defamatory by innuendo is a question of fact).</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">{\u00b6 37} Because there is an innocent construction of defendant\u2019s broadcast about plaintiffs abduction of his son, defendant was entitled to summary judgment on plaintiffs claim that the story was defamatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">{\u00b6 38} Plaintiffs first and second assignments of error are overruled, and the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b61-9\">Tyack, P.J., and Petree, J., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b61-10\">John W.
