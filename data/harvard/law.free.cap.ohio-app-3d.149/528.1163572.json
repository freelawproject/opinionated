Sweeney, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b564-14\">{\u00b6 1} Plaintiff-appellant Dub Surry appeals from a judgment of the common pleas court that granted defendants-appellees Cuyahoga Community College (\u201cCCC\u201d) and Alliston Moreland\u2019s motion for summary judgment on Surry\u2019s claims. Upon review, we conclude that there are no genuine issues of material fact and that defendants are entitled to judgment as a matter of law on Surry\u2019s claims. Accordingly, we affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-15\">{\u00b6 2} A review of the record reveals the following facts: Surry, a 65-year-old male, was hired as a security guard at CCC in 1974. His employment was governed by a collective bargaining agreement. In 1994, he began working at CCC\u2019s Eastern Campus in Highland Hills, Ohio. During most of his tenure at CCC\u2019s Eastern Campus, his immediate supervisor was Moreland.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-16\">{\u00b6 3} Surry claims that shortly after Moreland became his supervisor, he began making comments to him about his age. Specifically, that Moreland called him a \u201cdinosaur,\u201d told him he was too old and that he needed to retire. Surry also claims that Moreland made similar comments about him to Sue Flores, another CCC employee and union steward.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>{\u00b6 4} Surry made several complaints about Moreland\u2019s behavior to Flores, Herb Baker, CCC\u2019s EEO Coordinator, and Clayton Harris (\u201cChief Harris\u201d), CCC\u2019s Chief of Public Safety. Baker told Flores that he would speak with Moreland and tell him to stop making such comments.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\">{\u00b6 5} On February 22, 2000, several weeks after Surry\u2019s complaint to Baker, a sixteen-year-old girl made a complaint to CCC\u2019s Department of Public Safety that Surry engaged in inappropriate conduct with her. Specifically, the young girl alleged that Surry made remarks of a sexual nature to her and touched her buttocks. The young girl prepared a written statement that day detailing what she alleged Surry had said and done.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">{\u00b6 6} CCC\u2019s Department of Public Safety conducted an investigation into the young girl\u2019s allegations against Surry and took statements from several different individuals.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">{\u00b6 7} On March 14, 2000, an investigatory hearing took place. Surry was accompanied by his attorney. At the hearing, Surry admitted that he had engaged in conversations with the young girl but denied making any sexual comments or touching her.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">{\u00b6 8} Following the hearing, Chief Harris concluded that Surry had engaged in inappropriate behavior with the young girl and decided to terminate his employment. Dan Hauenstein, Director of Labor and Employee Relations, sent Surry a letter informing him of his discharge from CCC.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">{\u00b6 9} On May 23, 2001, Surry filed this complaint against CCC and Moreland alleging claims of age discrimination, age harassment, retaliation, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and wrongful discharge in violation of public policy.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b565-9\">{\u00b6 10} On December 17, 2001, defendants filed a motion for summary judgment, which was granted by the trial court on March 8, 2002. It is from this decision that Surry now appeals and raises seven assignments of error for our review. We will address plaintiffs assignments of error together as they all address the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment:</p>\n<p id=\"b565-10\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cI. The trial court erred in granting summary judgment with respect to plaintiffs claim of age discrimination when genuine issues of material fact existed on each element of plaintiffs claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-11\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cII. The trial court erred in granting summary judgment with respect to plaintiffs claim of retaliation when genuine issues of material fact existed on each element of plaintiffs claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>{\u00b6 13} \u201cIII. The trial court erred in granting summary judgment with respect to plaintiffs claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress when genuine issues of material fact existed on plaintiffs claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cIV. The trial court erred with respect to plaintiffs claim of age harassment when a genuine issue of material fact existed on each element of plaintiffs claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cV. The trial court erred in granting summary judgment with respect to plaintiffs claim of violation of public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">{\u00b6 16} \u201cVI. The trial court erred in granting summary judgment by failing to draw all reasonable inferences in favor of appellant, the non-moving party.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cVII. The trial court erred in granting summary judgment with respect to all of plaintiffs claims when a genuine issue of material fact existed as to whether Clayton Harris was truly the decision maker who decided that plaintiffs employment should be terminated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b566-9\">{\u00b6 18} In these assignments of error, Surry claims that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of defendants because genuine issues of material fact existed concerning his claims for age discrimination, retaliation, intentional infliction of emotional distress, age harassment, and violation of public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-10\">{\u00b6 19} An appellate court reviews a trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo. <em>Grafton v. Ohio Edison Co. </em>(1996), 77 Ohio St.3d 102, 105, 671 N.E.2d 241. \u201cDe novo review means that this court uses the same standard that the trial court should have used, and we examine the evidence to determine whether as a matter of law no genuine issues exist for trial.\u201d <em>Brewer v. Cleveland City Schools </em>(1997), 122 Ohio App.3d 378, 701 N.E.2d 1023, citing <em>Dupler v. Mansfield Journal </em>(1980), 64 Ohio St.2d 116, 119-120, 413 N.E.2d 1187.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-11\">{\u00b6 20} Summary judgment is appropriate where it appears that (1) there is no genuine issue as to any material fact; (2) the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law; and (3) reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion, and that conclusion is adverse to the party against whom the motion for summary judgment is made, who is entitled to have the evidence construed most strongly in his favor. <em>Harless v. Willis Day Warehousing Co. </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 64, 66, 8 O.O.3d 73, 375 N.E.2d 46; Civ.R. 56(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-12\">{\u00b6 21} The burden is on the movant to show that no genuine issue of material fact exists. Id. Conclusory assertions that the nonmovant has no evidence to prove its case are insufficient; the movant must specifically point to evidence contained within the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, written admissions, affidavits, etc. that affirmatively demonstrate that the nonmovant has no evidence to support his claims. <em>Dresher v. Burt </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 280, 293, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>662 N.E.2d 264; Civ.R. 56(C). Unless the nonmovant then sets forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue of material fact for trial, summary-judgment will be granted to the movant.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">{\u00b6 22} With these principles in mind, we proceed to consider whether the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in defendants\u2019 favor was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">A. Age Discrimination</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">{\u00b6 23} To set forth a prima facie case of age discrimination in an employment discharge action, the employee must show (1) that he was a member of the statutorily protected class; (2) that he was discharged; (3) that he was qualified for the position; and (4) that he was replaced by, or that his discharge permitted the retention of, a person not belonging to the protected class. <em>Barker v. Scovill, Inc. </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St.3d 146, 6 OBR 202, 451 N.E.2d 807.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">{\u00b6 24} Once a prima facie case of discrimination is established, the employer may overcome the presumption by coming forward with a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the discharge. <em>Kohmescher v. Kroger Co. </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 501, 575 N.E.2d 439. The employee must then present evidence that the employer\u2019s proffered reason was a mere pretext for unlawful discrimination. <em>Manofsky v. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. </em>(1990), 69 Ohio App.3d 663, 668, 591 N.E.2d 752. The employee\u2019s burden is to prove that the employer\u2019s reason was false and that discrimination was the real reason for the discharge. <em>Wagner v. Allied Steel &amp; Tractor Co. </em>(1995), 105 Ohio App.3d 611, 617, 664 N.E.2d 987. Mere conjecture that the employer\u2019s stated reason is a pretext for intentional discrimination is an insufficient basis for the denial of a summary judgment motion made by the employer. To meet his or her burden in response to such a summary judgment motion, the plaintiff must produce some evidence that the employer\u2019s proffered reasons were factually untrue. <em>Powers v. Pinkerton, Inc. </em>(Jan. 18, 2001), Cuyahoga App. No. 76333, 2001 WL 60035.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-9\">{\u00b6 25} Here, Surry was a member of a protected class because he was 65 years old. He was also terminated from his position. However, he failed to meet the other two elements. Surry failed to show that he was qualified for the position. In order to demonstrate qualification for a position, a plaintiff must show that he is capable of performing the work and that he is meeting the employer\u2019s legitimate expectations. <em>Smith v. Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Auth. </em>(May 24, 2001), Cuyahoga App. No. 78274, 2001 WL 605405; <em>Ebright v. Video News Super Stores </em>(July 6, 2001), Lucas App. No. L-00-1369, 2001 WL 771008. Here, although Surry presented evidence that he was capable of performing his duties as a patrol officer, he did not meet CCC\u2019s legitimate expectations of performance of his duties since there is a reasonable belief that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>while on the job he engaged in inappropriate sexual conduct with a sixteen-year-old girl. Surry also failed to show that he was replaced by a person younger than he.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">{\u00b6 26} Surry failed to meet his burden of establishing a prima facie case of age discrimination because he did not show that he was qualified for the position or that his dismissal permitted the retention of a employee who was not a member of the protected class. Therefore, Surry\u2019s argument that CCC\u2019s stated reason for his termination is pretextual is moqt.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, the trial court did not err in granting the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment on Surry\u2019s age discrimination claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">B. Retaliatory Discharge</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\"> {\u00b6 27} To prove a claim of retaliation, Surry must establish three elements: (1) that he engaged in protected activity, (2) that he was subjected to an adverse employment action; and (3) that a causal link exists between a protected activity and the adverse action. <em>Peterson v. Buckeye Steel Casings </em>(1999), 133 Ohio App.3d 715, 727, 729 N.E.2d 813.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-8\">{\u00b6 28} Once an employee successfully establishes a prima facie case, it is the employer\u2019s burden to articulate a legitimate reason for its action. Id. If the employer meets its burden, the burden shifts back to the employee to show that the articulated reason was a pretext. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-9\">{\u00b6 29} \u201c[A] reason cannot be proved to be <em>\u2018a </em>pretext for discrimination\u2019 unless it is shown both that the reason was false, and that discrimination was the real reason.\u201d <em>St. Mary\u2019s Honor Ctr. v. Hicks </em>(1993), 509 U.S. 502, 515, 113 S.Ct. 2742, 125 L.Ed.2d 407. Mere conjecture that the employer\u2019s explanation is a pretext for intentional discrimination is an insufficient basis for denial of summary judgment. <em>Powers v. Pinkerton, </em>supra. To avoid summary judgment, Surry was required to produce some evidence that CCC\u2019s proffered reasons were factually untrue. Id. Here, Surry has failed to satisfy his burden in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-10\">{\u00b6 30} Summary judgment will be granted to the employer even if the employee establishes a prima facie case, if the employee presents no evidence to rebut the employer\u2019s legitimate nondiscriminatory reason. <em>Borowski v. State Chem. Mfg. Co. </em>(1994), 97 Ohio App.3d 635, 641, 647 N.E.2d 230. Assuming arguendo that Surry has established a prima facie case of retaliation, CCC had a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>legitimate business reason for terminating Surry. Specifically, CCC submits evidence that Surry was terminated because a young girl filed a complaint of sexual harassment against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">{\u00b6 31} Faced with summary judgment, Surry failed to offer sufficient evidence that this justification for his termination was pretext. Merely speculating that he was \u201cset up\u201d and that the young girl made up the story or claiming that her allegations had inconsistencies is insufficient. <em>See Powers v. Pinkerton, </em>supra. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in granting defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment on Surry\u2019s claim for retaliation.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">C. Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">{\u00b6 32} In order to establish a claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress, Surry must show (1) that defendants either intended to cause emotional distress or knew or should have known that actions taken would result in serious emotional distress to him, (2) that defendants\u2019 conduct was so extreme and outrageous as to go beyond all possible bounds of decency and was such that it can be considered as utterly intolerable in a civilized community, (3) that defendants\u2019 actions were the proximate cause of Surry\u2019s psychic injury, and (4) that the mental anguish suffered by Surry is serious and of a nature that no reasonable man could be expected to endure it. <em>Burkes v. Stidham </em>(1995), 107 Ohio App.3d 363, 375, 668 N.E.2d 982. Serious emotional distress requires an emotional injury that is both severe and debilitating. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">{\u00b6 33} To recover for intentional infliction of emotional distress in Ohio, it is not enough that the defendant has acted with an intent that is tortious or even criminal, or that he has intended to inflict emotional distress, or even that his conduct has been characterized by malice, or a degree of aggravation that would entitle the plaintiff to punitive damages for another tort. Liability is found only where the conduct is so outrageous in character, and so extreme in degree, as to go beyond all possible bounds of decency, and to be regarded as atrocious and utterly intolerable in a civilized community. <em>Yeager v. Loc. Union 20 </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St.3d 369, 374-375, 6 OBR 421, 453 N.E.2d 666.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-9\">{\u00b6 34} Here, Surry claims that the following actions on the part of defendants constituted reckless, wanton, extreme, and outrageous conduct: (1) Moreland, his supervisor, belittled him about his age and called him a \u201cdinosaur\u201d and a \u201crelic\u201d; (2) the young girl alleging sexual misconduct filed criminal proceedings against him<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>; and (3) he was terminated from his job.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>{\u00b6 35} We conclude that these allegations do not satisfy the elements of intentional infliction of emotional distress as a matter of law. While we do not condone the conduct of Moreland, we find as a matter of law that no reasonable jury could find that the comments made by him constituted extreme and outrageous conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">{\u00b6 36} Moreover, an employer is not liable for a plaintiffs emotional distress if the employer does no more than \u201cinsist upon his legal rights in a permissible way, even though he is well aware that such insistence is certain to cause emotional distress.\u201d <em>Foster v. McDevitt </em>(1986), 31 Ohio App.3d 237, 239, 31 OBR 520, 511 N.E.2d 403. Because CCC determined that Surry had engaged in sexual misconduct with a young student, CCC was entitled to terminate him, regardless of whether they knew or intended that the termination would add to his emotional distress. Id. See, also, <em>Simonelli v. Anderson Concrete Co. </em>(1994), 99 Ohio App.3d 254, 262, 650 N.E.2d 488; <em>Hanly v. Riverside Methodist Hosp. </em>(1991), 78 Ohio App.3d 73, 82, 603 N.E.2d 1126. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in granting defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment on Surry\u2019s claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">D. Age Harassment</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">{\u00b6 37} In order to establish a claim of age harassment, Surry must show (1) that he is at least 40 years old; (2) that he was subjected to harassment, either through words or actions, based on his age; (3) that the harassment had the effect of unreasonably interfering with his work performance and creating an objectively intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment; and (4) that liability should attach to the employer. <em>Crawford v. Medina Gen. Hosp. </em>(C.A.6, 1996), 96 F.3d 830, 834-835.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-8\">{\u00b6 38} Not all workplace conduct that can be construed as offensive can be characterized as harassment forbidden by statute. <em>Meritor Sav. Bank, FSB v. Vinson </em>(1986), 477 U.S. 57, 66-67, 106 S.Ct. 2399, 91 L.Ed.2d 49. Rather, the conduct complained of must be severe or pervasive enough to create an environment that not only the victim subjectively regards as abusive but also a reasonable person would find hostile or abusive. <em>Crawford v. Medina Gen. Hosp., </em>supra. Pursuant to this standard, conduct that is merely offensive is not actionable. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-9\">{\u00b6 39} The court must examine the circumstances surrounding the conduct and must consider them within the framework of several factors to determine whether the conduct is actionable. These factors include the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b570-10\">{\u00b6 40} \u201c(1) the conduct\u2019s frequency;</p>\n<p id=\"b570-11\">(\u00b6 41} \u201c(2) the conduct\u2019s severity;</p>\n<p id=\"b571-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>{\u00b6 42} \u201c(3) whether the conduct is physically threatening or humiliating; and</p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\">{\u00b643} \u201c(4) whether the conduct unreasonably interferes with the victim\u2019s work performance.\u201d <em>Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc. </em>(1993), 510 U.S. 17, 23, 114 S.Ct. 367, 126 L.Ed.2d 295.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">{\u00b6 44} With these factors in mind, we conclude that Moreland\u2019s behavior was not severe or pervasive and did not reasonably interfere with Surry\u2019s work performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">{\u00b645} Surry complained of the following instances of Moreland\u2019s conduct toward him over a span of several years: (1) he constantly told him he was \u201ctoo old\u201d; (2) he constantly asked him \u201cwhy don\u2019t you retire?\u201d; (3) he called him \u201cabsentminded\u201d; and (4) he told another employee, Sue Flores, that he was a \u201cdinosaur\u201d and a \u201crelic.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">{\u00b6 46} These comments, although rude, are simply not severe or pervasive enough to create an objectively hostile environment. Surry\u2019s complaints are of \u201cmere offensive utterances,\u201d as opposed to physically threatening or humiliating conduct. Again, \u201cnot all workplace conduct that may be described as \u2018harassment\u2019 affects a \u2018term, condition or privilege\u2019 of employment within the meaning of Title VII.\u201d <em>Meritor, </em>477 U.S. at 67, 106 S.Ct. 2399, 91 L.Ed.2d 49.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">{\u00b6 47} Finally, since Surry remained an employee for at least six years under Moreland\u2019s supervision and always received average to above-average evaluations, he cannot prove that Moreland\u2019s actions toward him affected him in his work performance; indeed, he claims to like his job, despite Moreland\u2019s asserted abusiveness.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-9\">{\u00b6 48} The evidence shows that Surry cannot establish the elements necessary to support his claim of workplace age harassment. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in granting defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment on the claim for age harassment.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-10\">E. Violation of Public Policy</p>\n<p id=\"b571-11\"> {\u00b6 49} The origin of the tort of wrongful discharge in violation of public policy is the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Greeley v. Miami Valley Maintenance Contrs., Inc. </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St.3d 228, 551 N.E.2d 981. <em>Greeley </em>provides that public policy warrants an exception to the employment-at-will doctrine when an employee is discharged or disciplined for a reason prohibited by statute. However, a <em>Greeley </em>cause of action is available only to at-will employees and may not be asserted by employees subject to a collective bargaining agreement. <em>Haynes v. Zoological Soc. of Cincinnati </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 254, 257, 652 N.E.2d 948.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>{\u00b6 50} Here, Surry was, subject to a collective bargaining agreement. Thus, he cannot assert a cause of action for wrongful discharge in violation of public policy. Id. See, also, <em>Noday v. Mahoning Cty. Sheriff </em>(2002), 147 Ohio App.3d 38, 768 N.E.2d 726; <em>Wiegerig v. Timken Co. </em>(2001), 144 Ohio App.3d 664, 761 N.E.2d 118; <em>Kulak v. Mail-Well Envelope Co. </em>(Aug. 31, 2000), Cuyahoga App. No. 76974, 2000 WL 1231486; <em>Stallworth v. Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Auth. </em>(Nov. 5, 1998), Cuyahoga App. No. 73533, 1998 WL 774987. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in granting defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment on Surry\u2019s claim for wrongful discharge in violation of public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">F. Reasonable Inferences</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">{\u00b6 51} Surry argues that the trial court considered the weight of the evidence and construed inferences in its decision to grant defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment. We disagree. After reviewing the record, we conclude that the trial court made a thorough analysis of the evidence and correctly followed the requirements of Civ.R. 56(C) in making its determination that there was no evidence of substantial probative value to support Surry\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">G. Moreland\u2019s Status</p>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">{\u00b6 52} Finally, Surry argues that there remains an issue of fact with regard to whether Moreland participated in the decision to terminate his employment. Based on our determination that Surry failed to meet his burden of establishing a prima facie case of age discrimination, we find this argument to be moot. Surry failed to demonstrate that he was terminated because of his age. Rather, the evidence shows that termination occurred because of his behavior at work. Accordingly, Moreland\u2019s alleged bias toward Surry and his role in the ultimate decision to terminate Surry\u2019s employment are irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-9\">{\u00b6 53} Appellant\u2019s first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh assignments of error are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-10\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b572-11\">Kenneth A.

Assuming arguendo that Surry had demonstrated a prima facie case, the claim does not survive because CCC demonstrated a nondiscriminatory explanation for the termination, i.e., the sexual harassment of a young student, and Surry cannot show that this explanation was a pretext or that the termination proceedings were motivated by intentional age discrimination.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b569-10\">. Surry was picked up and arrested by the Highland Hills Police Department for gross sexual imposition and contributing to the delinquency of a minor. These charges were dropped by the city of Highland Hills.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
