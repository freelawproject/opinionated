We reverse the trial court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-13\">{\u00b6 <em>2} </em>On June 11, 2001, defendant-appellee, James Craft, was indicted for aggravated murder in violation of R.C. 2903.01(B). The indictment alleged that on or about June 13, 1974, appellee purposely caused the death of Cynthia Beuerlein while committing or attempting to commit the offense of kidnapping.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-14\">{\u00b6 3} Appellee requested discovery and a bill of particulars. Among the items appellee requested were the names and addresses of witnesses interviewed by the state in connection with its investigation of the victim\u2019s death. Appellee also requested that the state provide all witness statements obtained in connection with its investigation. The state filed a bill of particulars and provided some of the items requested by appellee. However, the state refused to provide appellee with the names and addresses of witnesses it did not intend to call at trial. The state also refused to disclose all witness statements obtained in connection with its investigation. The state claimed that the names and addresses and the witness statements were not discoverable under Crim.R. 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-15\">{\u00b6 4} The trial court held a discovery hearing on August 31, 2001. At the conclusion of the hearing, the trial court ordered the state to \u201cturn over to counsel for the defendant a list of the names and addresses of witnesses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>interviewed by law enforcement officers in connection with their investigation of this case in 1974.\u201d The trial court also ordered the state to turn over to the trial court \u201call statements of witnesses interviewed by law enforcement officers in connection with their investigation of this case\u201d for an in camera <em>Brady </em>material inspection. The trial court acknowledged that Crim.R. 16 did not specifically authorize the disclosure of these items. However, the trial court reasoned that due to the passage of time since the alleged crime took place, \u201cfundamental fairness\u201d required disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">{\u00b6 5} The state made a motion in this court for leave to file an interlocutory appeal pursuant to R.C. 2945.67. This court granted the state\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">{\u00b6 6} The state asserts one assignment of error on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cThe trial court\u2019s pretrial discovery order erroneously exceeded the scope of Crim.R. 16(B).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">{\u00b6 8} The state makes two arguments under its sole assignment of error. First, the state contends that the trial court abused its discretion in ordering the state to disclose the names and addresses of all witnesses interviewed by the state at the time of its investigation. Second, the state argues that the trial court abused its discretion in ordering the state to furnish to the trial court \u201cany and all statements of witnesses interviewed by law enforcement officers in connection with its investigation\u201d for an in camera <em>Brady </em>inspection.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-9\">{\u00b6 9} In support of its first argument, the state asserts that providing the names and addresses of witnesses it does not intend to call at trial is contrary to Crim.R. 16(B). The state also argues that such disclosure unlawfully requires the state to disclose nondiscoverable investigatory work product and to create a document that does not exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-10\">{\u00b6 10} The granting or overruling of discovery motions in a criminal case rests within the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>State v. Shoop </em>(1993), 87 Ohio App.3d 462, 469, 622 N.E.2d 665. Abuse of discretion connotes more than an error of law or judgment; it implies that the trial court\u2019s decision was arbitrary, unreasonable, or unconscionable. <em>State v. Adams </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St.2d 151, 157, 16 O.O.3d 169, 404 N.E.2d 144; <em>State v. Davis </em>(1992), 79 Ohio App.3d 450, 454, 607 N.E.2d 543.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-11\">{\u00b6 11} Criminal defendants must be afforded a meaningful opportunity to present a complete defense. <em>California v. Trombetta </em>(1984), 467 U.S. 479, 485, 104 S.Ct. 2528, 81 L.Ed.2d 413. However, \u201c[tjhere is no general constitutional right to discovery in a criminal case * * <em>Weatherford v. Bursey </em>(1977), 429 U.S. 545, 559, 97 S.Ct. 837, 51 L.Ed.2d 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>{\u00b6 12} Crim.R. 16 identifies what information is discoverable in criminal cases. <em>State ex rel. Steckman v. Jackson </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 420, 428, 639 N.E.2d 83; <em>State v. Neiderhelman </em>(Sept. 18, 1995), Clermont App. No. 94-10-081, 1995 WL 550030. \u201c[I]n the criminal proceeding itself, a defendant may use only Crim.R. 16 to obtain discovery.\u201d <em>Steckman, </em>70 Ohio St.3d at 429, 639 N.E.2d 83. In Steckman, the court eliminated the use of public records requests to obtain discovery in criminal proceedings, specifically limiting discovery to that provided for in Crim.R. 16. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">{\u00b6 13} With regard to witness names and addresses, Crim.R. 16(B)(1)(e) provides: \u201cUpon motion of the defendant, the court shall order the prosecuting attorney to furnish to the defendant a written list of the names and addresses of all witnesses whom the prosecuting attorney intends to call at trial * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">{\u00b6 14} We find that the trial court abused its discretion in ordering the state to disclose \u201ca list of the names and addresses of witnesses interviewed by law enforcement officers in connection with [the state\u2019s] investigation * * * in 1974.\u201d Crim.R. 16(B)(1)(e) specifically addresses the disclosure of names and addresses of witnesses, and requires disclosure only of witnesses the state intends to call at trial. Thus, the trial court\u2019s order expands an area of discovery already addressed by Crim.R. 16. Permitting such discovery is inconsistent with the discovery procedure provided for in Crim.R. 16 and with <em>Steckman. </em>Therefore, we find that the trial court abused its discretion in ordering the state to disclose the names and addresses of witnesses it does not intend to call at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">{\u00b6 15} Appellee cites two cases from the Ninth Appellate District which state that, in some circumstances, trial courts may authorize discovery beyond the scope of Crim.R. 16. See <em>State v. Stutts </em>(Jan. 2, 1991), Lorain App. No. 90CA004879, 1991 WL 1964; <em>State v. Malroit </em>(Nov. 8, 2000), Medina App. No. 3034-M, 2000 WL 1675046. However, both of these cases are distinguishable from the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">{\u00b6 16} In <em>Stutts, </em>the defendant, who was charged with attempted rape and gross sexual imposition, requested an independent psychological evaluation of the alleged victim. The trial court granted the defendant\u2019s request. Crim.R. 16 does not address the defendant\u2019s right to obtain an independent psychological evaluation of a sexual abuse victim. The court of appeals, citing two federal district court cases, noted the trial court\u2019s \u201cinherent authority to order discovery so as to insure fundamental fairness in the proceedings before them.\u201d <em>Stutts, </em>Lorain App. No. 90CA004879, citing <em>United States v. Gerena </em>(D.Conn.1987), 116 F.R.D. 596, 598; <em>United States v. Cammisano </em>(W.D.Mo.1976), 413 F.Supp. 886, 892. The court stated that \u201cwhen a party seeks to discover materials not identified in Crim.R. 16, some evidence should be presented justifying a departure from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>standard practice unless such a need is readily apparent.\u201d <em>Stutts, </em>citing <em>United States v. Richter </em>(C.A.9, 1973), 488 F.2d 170, 175.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">{\u00b6 17} The <em>Stutts </em>court stated that \u201c[t]here should be, at the very least, a demonstration that such evidence is potentially exculpatory and cannot be obtained by other reasonable means\u201d before a trial court allows discovery beyond the scope of Crim.R. 16. The court further noted that Crim.R. 16 \u201cis a time-tested standard which promotes regularity and efficiency in discovery proceedings,\u201d and should be transcended only when absolutely necessary. The court held that the trial court\u2019s granting of the defendant\u2019s request for an independent evaluation was too broad. Stressing the need for rigorous scrutiny of a trial court\u2019s decision ordering discovery beyond the scope of Crim.R. 16, the court remanded the case so the trial court could set parameters on the scope of the independent evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">{\u00b6 18} In <em>Malroit, </em>the defendant, who was charged with felonious sexual penetration, sought discovery of psychological examinations of the alleged victim. The court acknowledged that such discovery is not addressed in Crim.R. 16. Citing <em>Stutts, </em>the court noted the trial court\u2019s inherent authority to order discovery not specifically authorized or prohibited by Crim.R. 16. <em>Malroit, </em>Medina App. No. 3034-M. However, the defendant did not demonstrate that the psychological examinations would produce potentially exculpatory evidence that could not be obtained by other reasonable means. Therefore, the court found that it was not within the trial court\u2019s discretion to order this discovery beyond the scope of Crim.R. 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">{\u00b6 19} The present case differs significantly from <em>Stutts </em>and <em>Malroit. Stutts </em>and <em>Malroit </em>both dealt with areas of discovery not addressed in the criminal rule. By contrast, discovery of names and addresses of witnesses is specifically addressed in Crim.R. 16. Crim.R. 16(B)(1)(e) requires the state to disclose only the names and addresses of witnesses it intends to call at trial. Thus, we find that the trial court\u2019s attempt to expand discovery beyond a specific area already addressed by Crim.R. 16 is an abuse of discretion. Such an expansion is unreasonable and contrary to the discovery scheme crafted by the drafters of the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-8\">{\u00b6 20} Even applying the standard set fox*th in <em>Stutts </em>and <em>Malroit, </em>the names and addx*esses sought by appellee would not be discovex-able. Appellee has not demonstrated and it is not apparent from the record that the names and addresses sought would produce \u201cpotentially exculpatory\u201d evidence that could not be \u201cobtained by other reasonable means.\u201d See <em>Stutts, </em>Lorain App. No. 90CA004879; <em>Malroit, </em>Medina App. No. 3034-M.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>{\u00b6 21} We now address appellee\u2019s second argument, regarding the trial court\u2019s in camera inspection of witness statements. Under this argument, the state asserts that the trial court did not have the authority to order the in camera <em>Brady </em>inspection. The state argues that ordering such an inspection is contrary to Crim.R. 16 and established case law.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">{\u00b6 22} Under <em>Brady v. Maryland </em>(1963), 373 U.S. 83, 87, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215, the state has a duty to disclose to the defense \u201cevidence favorable to an accused * * * where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment.\u201d Failure to disclose such evidence violates due process. Id. Crim.R. 16(B)(1)(f) codifies the prosecution\u2019s duty under <em>Brady. State v. Keene </em>(Sept. 20, 1996), Montgomery App. No. 14375, 1996 WL 531606. Crim.R. 16(B)(1)(f) provides: \u201cUpon motion of the defendant before trial the court shall order the prosecuting attorney to disclose to counsel for the defendant all evidence, known or which may become known to the prosecuting attorney, favorable to the defendant and material either to guilt or punishment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">{\u00b6 23} \u201cIn the typical case where a defendant makes only a general request for exculpatory material under <em>Brady </em>* * *, it is the State that decides which information must be disclosed. Unless defense counsel becomes aware that other exculpatory evidence was withheld and brings it to the court\u2019s attention, the prosecutor\u2019s decision on disclosure is final.\u201d <em>Pennsylvania v. Ritchie </em>(1987), 480 U.S. 39, 59, 107 S.Ct. 989, 94 L.Ed.2d 40. Thus, the prosecution, not the trial judge, ordinarily bears the duty of examining documents for potential <em>Brady </em>material. <em>State v. Lawson </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 336, 343, 595 N.E.2d 902.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">{\u00b6 24} The record shows that appellee\u2019s discovery requests for exculpatory material were general in nature. In his discovery demand, appellee requested from the state \u201cthe entire file of the Butler County Sheriffs Department or any other police agency involved in the investigation\u201d so that he could determine if any part of the file was \u201cmaterial to the preparation of his defense.\u201d Appellee also made a more general <em>Brady </em>request for all evidence \u201cfavorable to [appellee] and material to either guilt or punishment.\u201d Additionally, appellee made a \u201cmotion for disclosure of witness statements prior to trial.\u201d In an attached memorandum, appellee argued that the state should disclose all witness statements so that appellee could examine the statements for <em>Brady </em>material.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-8\">{\u00b6 25} We find that the trial court abused its discretion in ordering an in camera <em>Brady </em>inspection of witness statements. In this case, appellee made general discovery requests for exculpatory evidence in the state\u2019s possession. The state represented to appellee that no material and exculpatory evidence existed in its file. The record does not show that appellee became \u201caware that other exculpatory evidence was [being] withheld\u201d by the state. See <em>Ritchie, </em>480 U.S. at 59, 107 S.Ct. 989, 94 L.Ed.2d 40. Thus, the state\u2019s decision on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>disclosure of <em>Brady </em>material should have been final. See id. Therefore, the trial court abused its discretion in ordering the in camera inspection because ordering such an inspection is inconsistent with the procedure prescribed in <em>Brady </em>and its progeny.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">{\u00b6 26} Based on the foregoing, appellant\u2019s sole assignment of error is sustained. The trial court\u2019s August 31, 2001 discovery order and the in camera inspection that followed are null and void. We remand this case to the trial court for further proceedings according to law and consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b214-6\">Walsh, P.J., and William W.
