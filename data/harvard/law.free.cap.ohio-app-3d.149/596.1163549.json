Rich obtained workers\u2019 compensation benefits for his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>injury. He also commenced an employee intentional tort claim against Savage, alleging that the injuries he suffered were substantially certain to occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">{\u00b6 3} Savage had purchased a commercial general liability policy of insurance from Midwestern Indemnity Company (\u201cMidwestern\u201d), which provided policy limits of $1 million. When a consent judgment of $1.3 million was entered against Savage and in favor of Rich on his intentional tort claim, and Savage then assigned Rich his own rights of coverage under the Midwestern policy, Rich demanded satisfaction from Midwestern. The insurer then commenced the underlying declaratory judgment action to determine its duty of coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">{\u00b6 4} The policy contains two relevant exclusions from the liability coverage it provides. One excludes coverage of claims for bodily injury \u201cexpected or intended from the standpoint of the insured.\u201d The other excludes coverage of claims for bodily injury to \u201c[a]n employee of the insured arising out of or in the course of (a) Employment by the insured; or (b) Performing duties relating to the conduct of the insured\u2019s business.\u201d Midwestern moved for summary judgment on both exclusions. The trial court granted summary judgment to Midwestern on both.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">{\u00b6 5} Rich filed a timely notice of appeal. He argues on appeal that the trial court erred in finding that both exclusions in the Midwestern policy prevent coverage on his claim and the resulting judgment against Savage.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-8\">{\u00b6 6} The two exclusions, while they each concern bodily injury, implicate different and independent circumstances. Therefore, if we find that one applies, we need not address the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-9\">{\u00b6 7} We believe that the exclusion of liability coverage for claims for bodily injury to \u201can employee of the insured arising out of or in the course of * * * performing duties relating to the conduct of the insured\u2019s business\u201d specifically excludes coverage of Rich\u2019s claim under the Midwestern policy. It is undisputed that Rich was injured on the job while working for Savage and performing duties relating to the conduct of Savage\u2019s business. Therefore, the exclusion pertains to the injuries that Rich suffered, and which form the basis of his employer intentional tort claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-10\">{\u00b6 8} Rich argues that Midwestern nevertheless owes a duty of coverage. He relies on two decisions: <em>Maffett v. Moyer\u2019s Auto Wrecking </em>(June 7, 2000), Crawford App. Nos. 3-99-11 and 3-99-12, 2000 WL 743707; and <em>Miller v. Midwestern Indemn. Co. </em>(Feb. 23, 1996), Montgomery App. No. 15360, 1996 WL 397450. We believe that neither is dispositive of the issue presented here.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-11\">{\u00b6 9} In <em>Maffett, </em>a wrongful death claim alleged that the injury which resulted in death was substantially certain to occur. The employer\u2019s policy excluded coverage for injuries \u201carising out of and in the course of employment.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>The Third District Court of Appeals, relying on <em>Brady v. Safety-Kleen Corp. </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 624, 576 N.E.2d 722, reasoned that because employer intentional torts arise outside the employment relationship, the policy exclusion was ineffective to deny coverage of the injury concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">{\u00b6 10} <em>Brady </em>held that intentional torts that are substantially certain to occur are insurable. However, no employer is required to purchase insurance coverage against his liability for such intentional torts, and no insurer is required to offer or provide it. The <em>Maffett </em>court nevertheless read that coverage into the policy because the terms of the exclusion, \u201carising out of and in the course of employment,\u201d necessarily excludes intentional torts.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">{\u00b6 11} It is true that torts \u201carising out of and in the course of employment\u201d exist outside the employment relationship. <em>Blankenship v. Cincinnati Milacron Chem., Inc. </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St.2d 608, 23 O.O.3d 504, 433 N.E.2d 572. The holding was there applied to deny an employer the immunity from civil liability that attaches to injuries which arise from the employment relationship. However, it does not follow that a policy of liability insurance the employer has purchased that expressly excludes coverage of such injuries necessarily must cover them. The public-policy considerations implicated in <em>Blankenship </em>by the immunity-from-liability provision in the workers\u2019 compensation law simply do not extend on that same rationale to create coverage for liability which by the express terms of the policy does not exist. See <em>Penn Traffic Co. v. AIU Ins. Co. </em>(Sept. 10, 2001), Pike App. No. 00CA653, 2001 WL 1085242, certified conflict and discretionary appeal accepted for review in (2002), 95 Ohio St.3d 1406 and 1407, 765 N.E.2d 875 and 876.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">{\u00b6 12} In this case, however, the exclusion on which we rely is stated in different terms. Injuries to an employee \u201carising out of performing duties relating to the conduct of the insured\u2019s business\u201d are excluded. Rich argues that the meaning is the same as \u201carising out of and in the course of employment,\u201d and perhaps it is. However, we agree with the court in <em>Penn Traffic </em>that an exclusion in those terms is not ineffective, nor is the exclusion here involved, for the same reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-8\">{\u00b6 13} <em>Miller </em>was a decision of this court. However, the coverage found was not created by a commercial general liability insurance policy that contained an employment exclusion, but by an employer\u2019s liability coverage endorsement, which did. We merely refused to apply the exclusion in the one policy to the coverage the other provided, which would have rendered its terms meaningless.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-9\">{\u00b6 14} The Fourth District certified a conflict to the Supreme Court between its holding in <em>Penn Traffic, </em>with which our decision here is in accord, and the Fourth District\u2019s decision in <em>Maffett. </em>The Supreme Court has' accepted the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>conflict for determination, so whether we are correct will eventually be resolved in that context.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">{\u00b6 15} The assignment of error is overruled. The judgment of the trial court will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b631-7\">Brogan and Fain, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
