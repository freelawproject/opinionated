An adjudicatory hearing before a magistrate was held in Muskingum County, Ohio, on December 3, 2001. By decision filed January 4, 2002, the magistrate found appellant to be a juvenile traffic offender. Appellant filed objections on January 14, 2002. By judgment entry filed January 29, 2002, the trial court denied the objections and approved and adopted the magistrate\u2019s decision. The case was transferred to Licking County, Ohio, appellant\u2019s residence, for disposition. A dispositional hearing was held on March 20, 2002. By judgment entry filed same date, the trial court fined appellant $50 plus court costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">{\u00b6 2} Appellant filed an appeal and this matter is now before this court- for consideration. Assignments of error are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">{\u00b6 3} \u201cThe trial court erred as a matter of law in finding appellant to be a juvenile traffic offender where the unrebutted evidence established that the stop sign was not placed in conformance with the Ohio Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices for Streets and Highways.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b436-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b436-10\">{\u00b6 4} \u201cThe trial court erred in finding appellant a juvenile traffic offender under a \u2018substantial compliance\u2019 standard where the unrebutted evidence established that the stop sign was 8 3/4th inches below the 60 inch height requirement set forth in the Ohio Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices for Streets and Highways.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b436-11\">I, II</p>\n<p id=\"b436-12\">{\u00b6 5} Appellant\u2019s two assignments of error challenge the trial court\u2019s decision that he was a juvenile traffic offender. Appellant claims that he presented undisputed evidence that the stop sign he is charged with violating did not comply with the Ohio Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices for Streets and Highways (\u201cOMUTCD\u201d). Appellant claims that this fact was a complete defense to the traffic offense and that the trial court erred in finding that there was \u201csubstantial compliance.\u201d We agree with both of appellant\u2019s assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-13\">{\u00b6 6} There are no facts in dispute. In an agreed statement filed on May 7, 2002, in the Court of Common Pleas of Licking County, Ohio, both sides state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>that the \u201cstop sign\u2019s height was 56 l/4th inches from the ground level to the bottom of the sign\u201d and the \u201cstop sign was mounted 51 l/4th inches as measured from the bottom of the sign to the plane of the roadway,\u201d making the sign \u201c8 3/4 inches below the minimum set by OMUTCD.\u201d The sign\u2019s \u201cdimensions were 29 15/16 inches by 29 15/16 inches.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">{\u00b6 7} Both sides agree that the OMUTCD \u201crequires that the stop sign be mounted at a minimum height of at least 5 feet (60 inches) as measured from the bottom of the sign to the plane of the roadway\u201d and the sign \u201cbe 30 inches by 30 inches\u201d in height and width.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">{\u00b6 8} Appellant argues that R.C. 4511.12 mandates specifics for a traffic control device:</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cNo pedestrian, driver of a vehicle, or operator of a streetcar or trackless trolley shall disobey the instructions of any traffic control device placed in accordance with this chapter, unless at the time otherwise directed by a police officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cNo provision of this chapter for which signs are required shall be enforced against an alleged violator if at the time and place of the alleged violation an official sign is not in proper position and sufficiently legible to be seen by an ordinarily observant person. Whenever a particular section of this chapter does not state that signs are required, that section shall be effective even though no signs are erected or in place.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b437-9\">{\u00b6 11} Appellant argues that 8 3/4 inches off the minimum requirement is sufficient proof that the sign was \u201cnot in proper position.\u201d Appellant does not dispute that the sign was \u201csufficiently legible to be seen by an ordinarily observant person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b437-10\">{\u00b6 12} The gravamen of this appeal is whether an 8 3/4 inch deviation from the OMUTCD makes the sign \u201cnot in proper position\u201d pursuant to the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-11\">{\u00b6 13} Appellant argues that the use of \u201cshall\u201d in the statute requires strict adherence and that \u201csubstantial compliance\u201d is not the proper standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-12\">{\u00b6 14} In <em>Mansfield v. O\u2019Donnell </em>(Sept. 26, 1991), Richland App. No. CA-2826, 1991 WL 209907, this court found that strict compliance was not mandated if the evidence established that the offender had actually stopped at the sign and then subsequently failed to yield to ongoing traffic. The record sub judice does not establish how appellant violated the stop sign, i.e., did he stop, proceed and fail to yield the right of way, did he not stop at all, or did he make an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>incomplete stop.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Without this information, we are forced to adopt the strict compliance standard regarding the sign\u2019s placement.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">{\u00b6 15} R.C. 4511.11(A) states that all local authorities \u201cshall place and maintain traffic control devices in accordance with the department of transportation manual and specifications for a uniform system of traffic control devices.\u201d All traffic control devices \u201cshall conform to the state manual and specifications.\u201d R.C. 4511.11(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">{\u00b6 16} Given the facts in this case, we find that the stop sign in question did not conform to the state standard in height placement. An 8 3/4 inch variation invalidates the stop sign. See <em>Bowling Green v. McNamara </em>(1999), 132 Ohio App.3d 240, 724 N.E.2d 1175; <em>Maple Hts. v. Smith </em>(1999), 131 Ohio App.3d 406, 722 N.E.2d 607; <em>Mentor v. Mills </em>(July 22, 1988), Lake App. No. 12-269, 1988 WL 76764. The 1/16 inch in variation in height and width of the sign is de minimis and not controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">{\u00b6 17} Assignments of Error I and II are sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-8\">{\u00b6 18} The judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Licking County, Ohio, Juvenile Division is hereby vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-9\">Judgment vacated.</p>\n<judges id=\"b438-10\">Gwin, P.J., and Edwards, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b438-20\">. The Uniform Traffic Citation merely states \"Stop Sign\u201d and cites the code section, R.C. 4511.12.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
