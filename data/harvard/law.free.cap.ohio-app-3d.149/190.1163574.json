The magistrate issued an order to show cause why the complaint should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. See Appendix.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-17\">{\u00b6 3} Petitioner responded to the order to show cause, although respondent failed to do so. The magistrate issued a decision including findings of fact and conclusions of law and decided that the probate court has jurisdiction over an inter vivos trust, pursuant to R.C. 2101.24, and that the complaint for a writ of prohibition should be dismissed. Petitioner has filed objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision and argues that the probate court clearly lacks jurisdiction over an inter vivos trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>{\u00b6 4} The following facts are taken from petitioner\u2019s complaint for a writ of prohibition.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">{\u00b6 5} Petitioner is the successor trustee of an inter vivos trust executed by-Ruth Moore in November 1991. Petitioner was appointed in 1996 by an amendment to the trust. Michael Moore and Melody Quesenberry are beneficiaries of the trust. Mrs. Moore died in 1999. Mr. Moore filed a declaratory judgment action in probate court naming petitioner as a defendant, and, as part of that action, a probate court magistrate ordered petitioner to file an accounting. Petitioner complied with the magistrate\u2019s order and filed an accounting, and Mr. Moore filed exceptions to that accounting. Petitioner filed a motion to dismiss the exceptions, arguing that the probate court had no jurisdiction to rule on the exceptions. The magistrate heard both the motion to dismiss and the exceptions, overruled the motion to dismiss and, as part of that ruling, removed petitioner as trustee. Petitioner objected to the magistrate\u2019s order removing him as trustee and, one day prior to the hearing in probate court on the objections, filed this action seeking a writ of prohibition.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">{\u00b6 6} The magistrate\u2019s show cause order is analogous to a motion to dismiss. In <em>O\u2019Brien v. Univ. Community Tenants Union, Inc. </em>(1975), 42 Ohio St.2d 242, 71 O.O.2d 223, 327 N.E.2d 753, syllabus, the Ohio Supreme Court held:</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cIn order for a court to dismiss a complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted (Civ.R.12(B)(6)), it must appear beyond doubt from the complaint that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts entitling him to recovery. <em>(Conley v. Gibson </em>[1957], 355 U.S. 41, 78 S.Ct. 99, 2 L.Ed.2d 80, followed.)\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">{\u00b6 8} In ruling on a motion to dismiss, pursuant to Civ.R. 12(B)(6), a court must presume all factual allegations of the complaint are true and make all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party. <em>Mitchell v. Lawson Milk Co. </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 190, 532 N.E.2d 753.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-9\">{\u00b6 9} In <em>State ex rel. Tubbs Jones v. Suster </em>(1998), 84 Ohio St.3d 70, 74, 701 N.E.2d 1002, the court stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b224-10\">(\u00b6 10} \u201cIn order for a writ of prohibition to issue, the relator must prove that (1) the lower court is about to exercise judicial authority, (2) the exercise of authority is not authorized by law, and (3) the relator possesses no other adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law if the writ of prohibition is denied. <em>State ex rel. Keenan v. Calabrese </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 176, 178, 631 N.E.2d 119, 121.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b224-11\">{\u00b6 11} Prohibition tests and determines \u201csolely and only\u201d the subject matter jurisdiction of the lower court. If the court has such jurisdiction, prohibition is not available to prevent or correct an erroneous decision, nor is it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>available as a remedy for an abuse of discretion. <em>State ex rel. Eaton Corp. v. Lancaster </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 404, 584 N.E.2d 46. Likewise, prohibition is not available to prevent an anticipated erroneous judgment. The Ohio Supreme Court has held that a writ of prohibition will be granted where the lack of jurisdiction is patent and unambiguous. <em>Ohio Dept. of Adm. Serv., Office of Collective Bargaining v. State Emp. Relations Bd. </em>(1990), 54 Ohio St.3d 48, 562 N.E.2d 125.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">{\u00b6 12} Probate courts are courts of limited jurisdiction, and probate proceedings are limited to those actions permitted by statute and the Ohio Constitution. <em>Corron v. Corron </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 75, 531 N.E.2d 708. R.C. 2101.24(B)(1)(b) and (C) provide:</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">{\u00b6 13} \u201c(B)(1) The probate court has concurrent jurisdiction with, and the same powers at law and in equity as, the general division of the court of common pleas to issue writs and orders, and to hear and determine actions as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">{\u00b614} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">{\u00b6 15} \u201c(b) Any action that involves an inter vivos trust * * *.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-9\">{\u00b6 16} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b225-10\">{\u00b6 17} \u201c(C) The probate court has plenary power at law and in equity to dispose fully of any matter that is properly before the court, unless the power is expressly otherwise limited or denied by a section of the Revised Code.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b225-11\">{\u00b6 18} As is apparent from the cases on which petitioner relies, he is confusing arguments as to subject matter jurisdiction with arguments addressing the merits of a decision yet to be rendered by the probate court.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-12\">{\u00b6 19} In <em>Galbreath v. del Valle </em>(1993), 91 Ohio App.3d 829, 633 N.E.2d 1185, this court reversed the decision of the probate court, finding that the court abused its discretion by appointing a successor trustee without giving the beneficiaries sufficient time to choose their own trustee as provided for in the trust instrument. While <em>Galbreath </em>held that the trial court\u2019s decision was erroneous, it did not find that the trial court lacked jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-13\">{\u00b6 20} In <em>Schucker v. Metcalf </em>(1986), 22 Ohio St.3d 33, 22 OBR 27, 488 N.E.2d 210, the court held that, as a court of limited jurisdiction, the probate court had no jurisdiction over an inter vivos trust; however, <em>Schucker </em>was decided before R.C. 2101.24(B)(1)(b) was enacted and is not dispositive of the issues herein. Appellant argues that <em>Schucker </em>is still viable, as it was cited in <em>Dumas v. Estate of Dumas </em>(1994), 68 Ohio St.3d 405, 627 N.E.2d 978; however, <em>Dumas </em>cited <em>Schucker </em>only for the proposition that probate court had no jurisdiction over claims for money damages arising from allegations of fraud and that such claims must be heard in the general division of common pleas court. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number><em>Dumas </em>did not discuss the probate court\u2019s jurisdiction over an inter vivos trust pursuant to R.C. 2101.24(B)(1)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">{\u00b6 21} In <em>State ex rel. Goldberg v. Mahoning Cty. Probate Court </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 160, 753 N.E.2d 192, the Ohio Supreme Court held that the probate court did not have authority to issue a prejudgment order of attachment where the assets alleged to have been wrongfully concealed were from settlements in wrongful-death claims and were not assets of the decedent\u2019s estate. The court further held that the probate court\u2019s plenary grant of authority in R.C. 2101.24(C) did not allow the prejudgment attachment order because the proceeding involved assets that were not part of the decedent\u2019s estate and were not properly before the court. Here, R.C. 2101.24(B)(1)(b) does grant the probate court authority over an inter vivos trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">{\u00b6 22} Last, in <em>In re Guardianship of Lombardo </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 600, 604, 716 N.E.2d 189, the court held:</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">{\u00b6 23} \u201cThe language of R.C. 2101.24 unambiguously provides the probate court with concurrent jurisdiction with the court of common pleas to address <em>inter vivos </em>trusts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">{\u00b6 24} Despite this clear language, appellant argues that <em>Lombardo </em>established a public policy that a probate court\u2019s authority should not be permitted to override the expressed intent of a trust\u2019s settlor. Hence, petitioner argues, the probate court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to remove him as trustee. We disagree with petitioner\u2019s interpretation of <em>Lombardo. </em>In the first instance, the Ohio Supreme Court limited the probate court\u2019s actions \u201cin this case.\u201d Id. at 608, 716 N.E.2d 189. Further, the court did not hold that the probate court lacked subject matter jurisdiction but, rather, that the probate court\u2019s decision was erroneous. As stated above, petitioner is confusing arguments relating to the subject matter jurisdiction of the probate court with the merits of its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-9\">{\u00b6 25} Because the probate court has jurisdiction over an inter vivos trust, pursuant to R.C. 2101.24, and petitioner has an adequate remedy at law by way of appeal, petitioner\u2019s objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision are overruled to the extent indicated herein, and the requested writ of prohibition is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-10\">Objections overruled to extent indicated and writ of prohibition denied.</p>\n<judges id=\"b226-11\">Peggy Bryant and Glasser, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b226-12\">George M.

Macke, Magistrate.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-12\">{\u00b6 26} In this original action, relator, Mark Sladoje, Jr., the successor trustee of the Ruth A. Moore inter vivos trust, requests a writ of prohibition ordering respondent, Lawrence Belskis, Judge of the Franklin County Probate Court, to desist from removing relator as the successor trustee of the inter vivos trust that is the subject of a declaratory judgment action pending in the probate court.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-13\">Findings of Fact:</p>\n<p id=\"b227-14\">{\u00b6 <em>27} </em>1. According to the complaint, relator is a defendant in a declaratory judgment action filed by the plaintiff, Michael M. Moore, in the Franklin County Probate Court. Michael M. Moore and Melody J. Quesenberry are the children of Ruth A. Moore, who executed a revocable inter vivos trust on November 14, 1991, and amended the trust on November 22, 1996. Michael M. Moore and Melody J. Quesenberry are beneficiaries of the trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-15\">{\u00b6 28} 2. According to the complaint, relator was appointed successor trustee of the Ruth A. Moore inter vivos trust by the November 22, 1996 amendment. Ruth A. Moore died on December 14,1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-16\">{\u00b6 29} 3. According to the complaint, on July 20, 2001, a probate court magistrate issued a magistrate\u2019s decision ordering relator to file an accounting in the declaratory judgment action. Relator filed an accounting with the probate court, and Michael A. Moore filed exceptions to the accounting.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-17\">{\u00b6 30} 4. According to the complaint, on October 12, 2001, relator filed in the probate court a motion to dismiss the exceptions on grounds that the probate court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to hear the exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-18\">{\u00b6 31} 5. According to the complaint, the probate court magistrate heard relator\u2019s motion to dismiss and the exceptions to the accounting on October 25, 2001. On November 16, 2001, the probate court magistrate issued her decision denying the motion to dismiss and removing relator as the successor trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>{\u00b6 32} 6. According to the complaint, relator filed objections to the probate magistrate\u2019s decision. On January 3, 2002, finding that relator had not received 10 days notice of the removal hearing, Judge Belskis issued an entry scheduling a hearing for January 15, 2002, at 9:00 a.m. to determine whether relator shall be removed as successor trustee. The entry further provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">{\u00b6 33} \u201cIt is further ORDERED that the trustee is hereby RESTRAINED from removing, disbursing, conveying, distributing, encumbering, transferring, or in any other way affecting the assets of the trust until further Order of this Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">{\u00b6 34} 7. On January 14, 2002, one day before the scheduled removal hearing in probate court, relator filed this original action for a writ of prohibition. Contemporaneously with the filing of this action, relator moved for an order from this court to \u201cstay\u201d the removal hearing. In his memorandum in support, relator asserted that <em>Schucker v. Metcalf </em>(1986), 22 Ohio St.3d 33 [22 OBR 27, 488 N.E.2d 210], is controlling in this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">{\u00b6 35} 8. On January 14, 2002, by journal entry, this court denied relator\u2019s motion for stay, stating:</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">{\u00b6 36} \u201cR.C. 2101.24(B)(1)(b) provides that the probate court has concurrent jurisdiction over \u2018[a]ny action that involves an inter vivos trust.\u2019 <em>Schucker v. Metcalf </em>(1986), 22 Ohio St.3d 33 [22 OBR 27, 488 N.E.2d 210] interpreted a previous version of R.C. 2101.24 that did not grant concurrent jurisdiction to the probate court over inter vivos trusts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b228-9\">{\u00b6 37} 9. On January 22, 2002, this magistrate was appointed magistrate in this cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-10\">{\u00b6 38} 10. On March 1, 2002, this magistrate issued an order that no later than March 15, 2002, relator shall show cause in writing why this original action should not be dismissed for the failure of the complaint to state a claim upon which relief in prohibition can be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-11\">{\u00b6 39} 11. On March 13, 2002, relator filed his written response to the magistrate\u2019s show cause order.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-12\">{\u00b6 40} 12. The matter of the magistrate\u2019s order to show cause is now before this magistrate for his written decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-13\">Conclusions of Law:</p>\n<p id=\"b228-14\">{\u00b6 41} It is the magistrate\u2019s decision that this court dismiss this action for the failure of the complaint to state a claim upon which relief in prohibition can be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>{\u00b642} The matter at hand is akin to a Civ.R. 12(B)(6) motion to dismiss, which tests the sufficiency of the complaint. See <em>State ex rel. Boggs v. Springfield Local School Dist. Bd. of Edn. </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 94 [647 N.E.2d 788]. In reviewing the complaint, this court must take all the material allegations as admitted and construe all reasonable inferences in favor of relator. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">{\u00b6 43} In order for a court to dismiss a complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, it must appear beyond doubt from the complaint that the plaintiff/relator can prove no set of facts entitling him or her to , recover. <em>O\u2019Brien v.

In that case, the declaratory judgment action had been filed by Daniel M. Galbreath, the trustee of the Dorothy B. Galbreath family trust. Thereafter, Daniel M. Galbreath informed the probate court and all persons claiming an interest in the family trust that he was resigning as trustee of the trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-12\">{\u00b6 59} In <em>Galbreath, </em>the probate court had scheduled a hearing on the appointment of a new trustee. At the hearing, some trust beneficiaries requested a continuance so that they would have an opportunity to reach a consensus among all the beneficiaries to agree on a successor trustee before the probate court appointed one. The continuance was granted, but ultimately the probate court appointed the successor trustee without the agreement of the trust beneficiaries. An appeal was taken to this court from the order of the probate court appointing the successor trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-13\">{\u00b6 60} In <em>Galbreath, </em>this court stated that the central issue was whether the probate court abused its discretion by appointing the successor trustee. This court also addressed the question of whether the probate court had jurisdiction over the matter so that it had authority to rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-14\">{\u00b6 61} In <em>Galbreath, </em>this court agreed with the probate court\u2019s finding that it had jurisdiction to hear the matter placed before it by Daniel M. Galbreath, as trustee of the family trust. Quoting the portions of R.C. 2101.24 quoted above to support its jurisdictional determination, this court, in <em>Galbreath, </em>further stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b230-15\">{\u00b6 62} \u201cIn order for the probate court to exercise its subject-matter jurisdiction in a proceeding involving a trust and multistate beneficiaries, the court must have jurisdiction over the trust, the trust property or the trust parties.

Unques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>tionably, the probate court had jurisdiction over the family trust, the trust property and the trustee.\u201d 91 Ohio App.3d at 834 [633 N.E.2d 1185].</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">{\u00b6 63} In <em>Galbreath, </em>this court further held that the probate court had abused its discretion in appointing the successor trustee because it had failed to give the trust beneficiaries enough time to secure a successor trustee upon which they could agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">{\u00b6 64} The magistrate finds that this court\u2019s decision in <em>Galbreath </em>is disposi-tive on the question presented here: whether the probate court has subject matter jurisdiction to remove the successor trustee of an inter vivos trust when that question is presented to the probate court in a declaratory judgment action.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">{\u00b6 65} However, relator attempts to distinguish the <em>Galbreath </em>decision from the instant case. Relator argues:</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">{\u00b6 66} \u201cThe problem in the present case is that there was no declaratory action filed to remove Mark Sladoje as trustee and the probate court is taking such action on its own, claiming that once the declaratory action was filed to construe the language of the trust, the probate court had the authority and power to control the conduct of the trustee and the trust.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b231-9\">{\u00b6 67} While there are some factual differences between the <em>Galbreath </em>case and the instant case, relator\u2019s argument is nevertheless flawed.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-10\">{\u00b6 68} The complaint for declaratory judgment filed in the probate court by Michael M. Moore (attached as an exhibit to the complaint for a writ of prohibition) contains the following demand for judgment:</p>\n<p id=\"b231-11\">{\u00b6 69} \u2018WHEREFORE, Plaintiff demands judgment of this court construing the provisions of the Trust set forth in this Complaint as being in conflict with each other and in conflict with the laws of this State; to determine the intent of the Grantor; to determine the disposition of trust income and corpus; to determine the rights and responsibilities of the parties; and for such other and further relief in law and equity as shall be just and proper.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b231-12\">{\u00b6 70} Count four of the complaint for declaratory judgment states at paragraphs 26 and 27:</p>\n<p id=\"b231-13\">{\u00b6 71} \u201c26. Article Seven (F) of the Trust Instrument provides, in part, that the \u2018Trustee shall keep true and correct books of account showing all the transactions in the Trust estate, which books of account shall at all reasonable times, be open to the inspection of any beneficiary hereunder.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b231-14\">{\u00b6 72} \u201c27. Plaintiff has requested, in writing, that Mark Sladoje, Jr., as Trustee, provide the Plaintiff with an opportunity to inspect the books of account. Defendant has refused to comply, believing that he need only provide an annual accounting. This nonfeasance is in direct derogation of the terms of the Trust.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>{\u00b6 73} The instant complaint further discloses that the probate court magistrate ordered relator to file an accounting, that relator did file an accounting, and that Michael A. Moore filed exceptions to the accounting. Following a hearing on those exceptions, the probate court magistrate issued a decision removing relator as the successor trustee. Relator\u2019s objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision was set for hearing before Judge Belskis, whose scheduling entry ordered that relator be restrained from affecting the assets of the trust until further order of the probate court.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">{\u00b6 74} Civ.R. 54(C) states:</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">{\u00b6 75} \u201cExcept as to a party against whom a judgment is entered by default, every final judgment shall grant the relief to which the party in whose favor it is rendered is entitled, even if the party has not demanded the relief in the pleadings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">{\u00b6 76} While the complaint for declaratory judgment filed by Michael A. Moore did not specifically request the removal of relator as successor trustee, it, nevertheless, conferred upon the probate court subject matter jurisdiction to determine whether relator should be removed as successor trustee. Under Civ.R. 54(C) the probate court\u2019s jurisdiction to consider and grant relief in the declaratory judgment action is not limited by the failure of the pleading to demand the relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-9\">{\u00b6 77} Moreover, the issue here is not whether the probate court\u2019s magistrate abused her discretion in determining that relator should be removed as successor trustee. The issue is whether the probate court is vested with subject matter jurisdiction under R.C. 2101.24 to determine whether relator shall be removed as trustee. As this court\u2019s decision in <em>Galbreath </em>makes clear, the probate court does have subject matter jurisdiction to determine the matters that relator here asserts there is no jurisdiction to determine.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-10\">{\u00b6 78} It is clear beyond doubt from the complaint that this original action for a writ of prohibition fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. <em>O\u2019Brien, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-11\">{\u00b6 79} Accordingly, it is the magistrate\u2019s decision that this court dismiss this action.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
