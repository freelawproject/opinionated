Appellant argues on appeal that the ordinance is unconstitutionally vague and overbroad and violates the First Amendment. For the following reasons, we overrule appellant\u2019s assignment of error and affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-14\">{.\u00b6 <em>2} </em>On June 2, 2000, appellant was cited for a violation of former Youngstown Municipal Ordinance (\u201cOrd.\u201d) 539.07(b)(1). This ordinance has since been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>substantially amended, but at the time appellant was cited the ordinance stated as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">{\u00b6 3} \u201cNo person shall play any radio, music player or an audio system in a motor vehicle at such volume as to disturb the quiet, comfort or repose of other persons or at a volume which is plainly audible to persons other than the occupants of said vehicle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">{\u00b6 4} On September 25, 2000, appellant\u2019s counsel made an oral motion to dismiss the charge on constitutional grounds. The court denied the motion, and appellant immediately entered into a Crim.R. 11 plea agreement. Appellant pleaded no contest to the charge. The court determined that this was appellant\u2019s fourth offense for the same crime, and sentenced him to 60 days in jail and a $600 fine. Appellant filed this timely appeal on October 17, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">{\u00b6 5} Appellant presents a single assignment of error for our review:</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">{\u00b6 6} \u201cThe trial court erred by entering judgment against appellant since Section 539.07 of the Youngstown Municipal Ordinances is unconstitutional pursuant to the First, Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and Article I, Section 16 of the Ohio Constitution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">{\u00b6 7} Appellant raises three issues regarding the constitutionality of Ord. 539.07(b)(1). We begin our review by noting that all \u201clegislation enjoys a presumption of constitutionality.\u201d <em>State v. Thompson </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 584, 586, 752 N.E.2d 276. Any doubts about the constitutionality of a statute should be resolved in favor of a construction that upholds its validity. <em>State v. Dorso </em>(1983), 4 Ohio St.3d 60, 61, 4 OBR 150, 446 N.E.2d 449.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-9\">{\u00b6 8} Ord. 539.07(b)(1) contains two distinct limitations on the sound level of audio equipment in an automobile. The first provision prohibits maintaining the audio system in a car \u201cat such a volume as to disturb the quiet, comfort or repose of other persons.\u201d The second provision prohibits using the audio system \u201cat a volume which is plainly audible to persons other than the occupants of said vehicle.\u201d Appellant was charged with playing \u201cloud and disturbing music from an automobile\u201d in violation of Ord. 539.07(b)(1). This charge encompasses both provisions of Ord. 539.07(b)(1). Appellant focuses exclusively on the phrase \u201cplainly audible\u201d in the second part of Ord. 539.07(b)(1). Based on the record, it appears that the trial court was justified in convicting appellant under the first provision found in Ord. 539.07(b)(1). Since we determine that the first part of Ord. 539.07(b)(1) is constitutionally sound and provides ample justification for appellant\u2019s conviction, it is not necessary for us to consider the constitutionality of the second part of the ordinance in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-10\">{\u00b6 9} The record plainly reflects that appellant pleaded no contest to the loud-music violation. A plea of no contest is an admission of the facts set forth in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>the complaint or indictment. <em>State v. Bird </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 582, 584, 692 N.E.2d 1013. Therefore, appellant admitted that he was playing loud and disturbing music in and from his automobile so as to violate Ord. 539.07(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">{\u00b6 10} Appellant\u2019s first argument asserts that the loud-music ordinance is impermissibly vague. \u201c[A]n enactment is void for vagueness if its prohibitions are not clearly defined.\u201d <em>Grayned v. Rockford </em>(1972), 408 U.S. 104, 108, 92 S.Ct. 2294, 33 L.Ed.2d 222.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cUnder the vagueness doctrine, which is premised on the Fourteenth Amendment due-process requirement that a \u2018law give fair notice of offending conduct,\u2019 a statute is void for vagueness if it \u2018 \u201cfails to give a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice that his contemplated conduct is forbidden by the statute\u201d * * * [or if] it encourages arbitrary and erratic arrests and convictions.\u2019 <em>Papachristou v. Jacksonville </em>(1972), 405 U.S. 156, 162, 92 S.Ct. 839, 843, 31 L.Ed.2d 110, 115-116 (quoting <em>United States v. Harriss </em>[1954], 347 U.S. 612, 617, 74 S.Ct. 808, 812, 98 L.Ed. 989).\u201d <em>Cincinnati v. Thompson </em>(1994), 96 Ohio App.3d 7, 24, 643 N.E.2d 1157.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">{\u00b6 12} In <em>Dorso, </em>supra, the Ohio Supreme Court was faced with a \u201cvoid for vagueness\u201d challenge of a Cincinnati noise ordinance. The court was asked to determine whether the phrase \u201cto disturb the peace and quiet\u201d was so subjective and dependent on the personal sensitivities of the listener that, essentially, the ordinance provided no measurable standard of conduct. 4 Ohio St.3d at 63, 4 OBR 150, 446 N.E.2d 449.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">{\u00b6 13} The <em>Dorso </em>court stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b247-9\">{\u00b6 14} \u201c[W]e construe the Cincinnati ordinance at issue to prohibit the playing of music, amplification of sound, etc., in a manner which could be anticipated to offend the reasonable person, <em>i.e., </em>the individual of common sensibilities. Specifically, we find the ordinance to proscribe the transmission of sounds which disrupt the reasonable conduct of basic human activities, <em>e.g., </em>conversation or sleep. Our construction of the ordinance does not permit the imposition of criminal liability upon a party whose conduct disturbs only the hypersensitive. Thus, the standard hereby adopted vitiates the claimed vagueness of the ordinance.\u201d Id. at 63-64, 4 OBR 150, 446 N.E.2d 449.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-10\">{\u00b6 15} Many other courts have held that noise statutes that are based on the \u201creasonable person\u201d standard are sufficiently clear to withstand a \u201cvoid for vagueness\u201d challenge. <em>Kovacs v. Cooper </em>(1949), 336 U.S. 77, 69 S.Ct. 448, 93 L.Ed. 513; <em>Kelleys Island v. Joyce </em>(2001), 146 Ohio App.3d 92, 765 N.E.2d 387; <em>Edison v. Jenkins </em>(June 7, 2000), 5th Dist. No. CA893, 2000 WL 873692; <em>State v. Boggs </em>(June 25, 1999), 1st Dist. No. C-980640, 1999 WL 420108; <em>State v. Linares </em>(1995), 232 Conn. 345, 655 A.2d 737; <em>Price v. State </em>(Ind.1993), 622 N.E.2d 954; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number><em>Beaufort v. Baker </em>(1993), 315 S.C. 146, 432 S.E.2d 470; <em>Madison v. Baumann </em>(1991), 162 Wis.2d 660, 470 N.W.2d 296.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">{\u00b6 16} Additionally, the fact that Ord. 539.07(b)(1) does not define the phrase \u201cdisturb the quiet, comfort, or repose\u201d does not render the ordinance impermissi-bly vague. This phrase is substantially synonymous with \u201cdisturbing the peace.\u201d Statutes that prohibit \u201cdisturbing the peace\u201d are construed, if possible, to apply only to conduct that is actually intended to create a disturbance and to exclude conduct that would only be disturbing to an unduly sensitive person. Dorso, 4 Ohio St.3d at 64, 4 OBR 150, 446 N.E.2d 449.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">{\u00b6 17} \u201c \u2018The ter[m] \u201cdisturb the peace\u201d * * * [has] long been understood to mean disruption of public order by acts that are themselves violent or that tend to incite others to violence. Thus, one may be guilty of disturbing the peace * * * if he engages in \u201ctumultuous\u201d conduct, <em>ie., </em>violent conduct that * * * endangers public safety or order. He may also be guilty of disturbing the peace through \u201coffensive\u201d conduct if by his actions he * * * incites others to violence or engages in conduct likely to incite others to violence.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Starsky </em>(1970), 106 Ariz. 329, 331, 475 P.2d 943, quoting <em>In re Bushman </em>(1970), 1 Cal.3d 767, 773, 83 Cal.Rptr. 375, 463 P.2d 727.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">{\u00b6 18} The offense of \u201cdisturbing the peace\u201d has been understood, from its common-law origin up to the present, to include a wide variety of conduct that destroys or threatens public order and tranquility. <em>United States v. Woodard </em>(C.A.7, 1967), 376 F.2d 136, 141. Whether conduct is deemed to \u201cdisturb the peace\u201d is measured by the reasonableness of the conduct as viewed in the light of the surrounding facts and circumstances. Id.; <em>Dorso, </em>4 Ohio St.3d at 64, 4 OBR 150, 446 N.E.2d 449.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">{\u00b6 19} There seems to be no significant difference between part one of Ord. 539.07(b)(1) and the statute that was upheld in <em>Dorso. </em>Therefore, for the reasons set forth in <em>Dorso, </em>appellant\u2019s \u201cvoid-for-vagueness\u201d argument is rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-9\">{\u00b6 20} Appellant\u2019s second argument is that the statute is unconstitutionally overbroad on its face. The overbreadth doctrine is a very narrow concept applied only where First Amendment rights are at stake. <em>Cleveland v. Trzebuckowski </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 524, 528, 709 N.E.2d 1148.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-10\">{\u00b6 21} \u201cA court may strike down an overly broad government enactment in its entirety, even if the party before the court has not engaged in activities protected by the First Amendment, \u2018 \u201cif in its reach it prohibits constitutionally protected conduct.\u201d \u2019 <em>Cleveland v. Trzebuckowski </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 524, 528, 709 N.E.2d 1148, quoting <em>Grayned v. Rockford </em>(1972), 408 U.S. 104, 114, 92 S.Ct. 2294, 2302, 33 L.Ed.2d 222, 231. The [overbreadth] doctrine allows such challenges because if an overly broad enactment is left in place, other persons may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>refrain from exercising their constitutionally protected rights for fear of criminal sanctions. <em>Village of Schaumburg v. Citizens for a Better Environment </em>(1980), 444 U.S. 620, 634, 100 S.Ct. 826, 835, 63 L.Ed.2d 73, 85-86. Overbreadth, however, is \u2018manifestly strong medicine\u2019 that is employed \u2018sparingly, and only as a last resort.\u2019 <em>Broadrick v. Oklahoma </em>(1973), 413 U.S. 601, 613, 93 S.Ct. 2908, 2917, 37 L.Ed.2d 830, 841.\u201d <em>Junction 615, Inc. v. Ohio Liquor Control Comm. </em>(1999), 135 Ohio App.3d 33, 41-42, 732 N.E.2d 1025.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">{\u00b6 22} Appellant\u2019s overbreadth argument of necessity involves a discussion of the Free Speech Clauses of both the First Amendment to United States Constitution and Section 11, Article I of the Ohio Constitution. The Ohio Supreme Court has held that \u201cthe free speech guarantees accorded by the Ohio Constitution are no broader than the First Amendment, and that the First Amendment is the proper basis for interpretation of Section 11, Article I of the Ohio Constitution.\u201d <em>Eastwood Mall, Inc. v. Slanco </em>(1994), 68 Ohio St.3d 221, 222, 626 N.E.2d 59, citing <em>State ex rel. Rear Door Bookstore v. Tenth Dist. Court of Appeals </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 354, 362-363, 588 N.E.2d 116. Therefore, appellant\u2019s argument should be viewed primarily through case law dealing with the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">{\u00b6 23} \u201cMusic, as a form of expression and communication, is protected under the First Amendment [to the United States Constitution].\u201d <em>Ward v. Rock Against Racism </em>(1989), 491 U.S. 781, 790, 109 S.Ct. 2746, 105 L.Ed.2d 661. Because Ord. 539.07(b)(1) implicates appellant\u2019s First Amendment rights, the ordinance, as applied to appellant, must meet the demands of the First Amendment, which states:</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">{\u00b6 24} \u201cCongress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">{\u00b6 25} An ordinance may be facially invalid \u201ceither because it is unconstitutional in every conceivable application, or because it seeks to prohibit such a broad range of protected conduct that it is unconstitutionally \u2018overbroad.\u2019 \u201d <em>Members of City Council of Los Angeles v. Taxpayers for Vincent </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 789, 796, 104 S.Ct. 2118, 80 L.Ed.2d 772.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-9\">{\u00b6 26} The parties in this case do not dispute that the city of Youngstown has an interest in protecting its citizens from unwelcome noise. Cf. <em>Dorso, </em>supra, 4 Ohio St.3d at 64, 4 OBR 150, 446 N.E.2d 449. Municipal authority to regulate noise has been specifically granted by statute. R.C. 715.49(A) states:</p>\n<p id=\"b249-10\">{\u00b6 27} \u201c(A) <em>Any municipal corporation may prevent </em>riot, gambling, <em>noise </em>and disturbance, and indecent and disorderly conduct or assemblages, preserve <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>the peace and good order, and protect the property of the municipal corporation and its inhabitants.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">{\u00b6 28} Ord. 539.07(b)(1) attempts to control noise emanating from automobile radios, music players, and audio systems. Some radio noises have nothing to do with protected speech, e.g., the buzzing sound of static from a radio that is not properly tuned to a station. Therefore, as Ord. 539.07(b)(1) may unquestionably prohibit the broadcasting of some loud radio noises without infringing on constitutional rights, the ordinance is not facially invalid in all circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">{\u00b6 29} Appellant nevertheless contends that Ord. 539.07(b)(1) restricts a significant amount of constitutionally protected speech. It is apparent, however, that Ord. 539.07(b)(1) is not primarily directed at the content of the speech but at the volume of the noise coming from automobile audio systems. The ordinance\u2019s prescription against loud noises is primarily an attempt to control conduct, i.e., the use of the volume control, rather than an attempt to control the type of speech being broadcast. See <em>Dorso, </em>4 Ohio St.3d at 64, 4 OBR 150, 446 N.E.2d 449. \u201cWhere conduct and not merely speech is involved, * * * the overbreadth of a statute must not only be real, but substantial as well, judged in relation to the statute\u2019s plainly legitimate sweep.\u201d <em>Broadrick v. Oklahoma </em>(1973), 413 U.S. 601, 615, 93 S.Ct. 2908, 37 L.Ed.2d 830.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">{\u00b6 30} A party making an overbreadth challenge must show that there is \u201ca realistic danger that the ordinance will significantly compromise recognized First Amendment protections of individuals not before the Court.\u201d Id. Furthermore, those who challenge the constitutionality of a statute on the basis that it is substantially overbroad must identify \u201cany significant difference between their claim that the ordinance is invalid on overbreadth grounds and their claim that it is unconstitutional when applied.\u201d <em>Taxpayers for Vincent, </em>466 U.S. at 802, 104 S.Ct. 2118, 80 L.Ed.2d 772. In other words, the party making the overbreadth challenge must demonstrate that there are significant issues to be resolved that are separate and distinct from those raised by the facts of the case. Appellant has not shown that the rights of hypothetical third parties are affected by Ord. 539.07(b)(1) any differently than his own rights have been affected. The ordinance does somewhat affect his right to play music, which right is protected by the First Amendment. <em>Rock Against Racism, </em>491 U.S. at 790, 109 S.Ct. 2746, 105 L.Ed.2d 661. The ordinance does not, however, fully restrict that right, and appellant does not suggest how Ord. 539.07(b)(1) affects any other person or group any differently than it affects him. Appellant\u2019s overbreadth allegation raises no additional issues to be resolved beyond those relating to the constitutionality of the statute as applied to facts of his own case. Therefore, appellant may not maintain an overbreadth challenge. See <em>Howard Opera House Assoc. v. Urban Outfitters, Inc. </em>(D.Vt.2001), 131 F.Supp.2d 559, 564.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>{\u00b6 31} In appellant\u2019s third argument, he contends that Ord. 539.07(b)(1) was applied in a selective and discriminatory manner. Selective prosecution violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution when it is \u201c \u2018deliberately based upon an unjustifiable standard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary classification.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cleveland v. Trzebuckowski </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 524, 530, 709 N.E.2d 1148, quoting <em>Oyler v. Boles </em>(1962), 368 U.S. 448, 456, 82 S.Ct. 501, 7 L.Ed.2d 446. Appellant completely bases his argument, however, on factual assertions that are not part of the record. It is well settled that constitutional decisions should not be made \u201cuntil the necessity for a decision arises on the record before the court.\u201d <em>Hal Artz Lincoln-Mercury, Inc. v. Ford Motor Co. </em>(1986), 28 Ohio St.3d 20, 28, 28 OBR 83, 502 N.E.2d 590, fn. 17. Therefore, appellant\u2019s third argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">{\u00b6 32} Normally, this court\u2019s analysis would end here because appellant has not alleged any other errors. Curiously, appellant has neglected to argue that Ord. 539.07(b)(1) violates his own First Amendment rights as applied to the facts of this case. Appellant may have assumed that he was also raising his own constitutional rights within his second argument as to the alleged \u201coverbreadth of the evidence.\u201d The very purpose, though, of an overbreadth claim is to address the rights of hypothetical third parties who are not before the court. In order to completely resolve this matter, we must address whether Ord. 539.07(b)(1), part one, violates the First Amendment as applied to the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">{\u00b6 33} Appellant does not attempt to challenge his no contest plea. Given the procedural history of this case and the relevant case law, we must assume that he did, in fact, play loud music from his car so as to disturb the quiet, comfort, and repose of others. The issue, then, is whether a municipality may legitimately regulate the type of activity described in Ord. 539.07(b)(1) (which appellant has admitted to) without violating the First Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">{\u00b6 34} A municipality \u201cmay impose reasonable restrictions on the time, place, or manner of protected speech, provided the restrictions are \u2018justified without reference to the content of the regulated speech, that they are narrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental interest, and that they leave open ample alternative channels for communication of the information.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rock Against Racism, </em>491 U.S. at 791, 109 S.Ct. 2746, 105 L.Ed.2d 661; see, also, <em>Painesville Bldg. Dept. v. Dworken &amp; Bernstein Co., L.P.A. </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 564, 567, 733 N.E.2d 1152.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">{\u00b6 35} \u201cA regulation that serves purposes unrelated to the content of expression is deemed neutral, even if it has an incidental effect on some speakers or messages but not others.\u201d <em>Rock Against Racism, </em>491 U.S. at 791, 109 S.Ct. at 2754, 105 L.Ed.2d at 675. A statute that interferes with protected speech is content neutral so long as it is \u201cjustified without reference to the content of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>regulated speech.\u201d <em>Clark v. Community for Creative Non-Violence </em>(1984), 468 U.S. 288, 293, 104 S.Ct. 3065, 82 L.Ed.2d 221. \u201cThe principal inquiry * * * is whether the government has adopted a regulation of speech because of disagreement with the message it conveys.\u201d <em>Rock Against Racism, </em>491 U.S. at 791, 109 S.Ct. 2746, 105 L.Ed.2d 661.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">{\u00b6 36} Appellee has argued that it has an interest in protecting its citizens from aberrant and unwelcome noise. It has repeatedly been held that this interest is a content-neutral justification for laws that regulate the time, place, or manner of protected speech. Id. at 792, 109 S.Ct. 2746, 105 L.Ed.2d 661; <em>Boos v. Barry </em>(1988), 485 U.S. 312, 320, 108 S.Ct. 1157, 99 L.Ed.2d 333; <em>Dorso, </em>4 Ohio St.3d at 64, 4 OBR 150, 446 N.E.2d 449. Furthermore, Ord. 539.07(b)(1), part one, regulates the use of audio <em>equipment, </em>i.e., radios, cassette players, compact disk players, etc., rather than regulating the type of sound or speech being broadcast by that equipment. Therefore, Ord. 539.07(b)(1), part one, satisfies the content-neutral requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">{\u00b6 37} A time, place, or manner regulation must also be narroyvly tailored to serve a significant governmental interest. Once again, appellee has identified its significant interest: it seeks to protect its citizens against unwelcome noise. A municipality has \u201c \u2018a substantial interest in protecting its citizens from unwelcome noise.\u2019 * * * [T]he government may act to protect even such traditional public forums as city streets and parks from excessive noise.\u201d <em>Rock Against Racism, </em>supra, 491 U.S. at 796, 109 S.Ct. 2746, 105 L.Ed.2d 661, quoting <em>Taxpayers for Vincent, </em>466 U.S. at 806, 104 S.Ct. 2118, 80 L.Ed.2d 772.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">{\u00b6 38} A time, place, or manner regulation is narrowly tailored to serve a governmental interest, \u201c \u2018so long as the * * * regulation promotes a substantial government interest that would be achieved less effectively absent the regulation.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 799, 109 S.Ct. 2746, 105 L.Ed.2d 661, quoting <em>United States v. Albertini </em>(1985), 472 U.S. 675, 689, 105 S.Ct. 2897, 86 L.Ed.2d 536. Narrow tailoring, in the context of time, place, or manner restrictions, \u201cneed not be the least restrictive or least intrusive means\u201d of achieving the government\u2019s intended result. Id. at 798, 109 S.Ct. 2746, 105 L.Ed.2d 661.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">{\u00b6 39} \u201cSo long as the means chosen are not substantially broader than necessary to achieve the government\u2019s interest, however, the regulation will not be invalid simply because a court concludes that the government\u2019s interest could be adequately served by some less-speech-restrictive alternative. \u2018The validity of [time, place, or manner] regulations does not turn on a judge\u2019s agreement with the responsible decisionmaker concerning the most appropriate method for promoting significant government interests\u2019 or the degree to which those interests should be promoted.\u201d Id. at 800, 109 S.Ct. 2746, 105 L.Ed.2d 661, quoting <em>Albertini, </em>472 U.S. at 689, 105 S.Ct. 2897, 86 L.Ed.2d 536.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>{\u00b6 40} Appellee chose to control excess noise by prohibiting the use of car radios \u201cat such volume as to disturb the quiet, comfort or repose of other persons.\u201d As stated earlier, the phrase \u201cdisturb the quiet, comfort or repose\u201d has a longstanding and well-defined meaning and is based on an objective \u201creasonable person\u201d standard. Appellee\u2019s interest in protecting its citizens from unwelcome noise is obviously served by part one of Ord. 539.07(b)(1). Part one of the ordinance infringes on protected speech only when it is broadcast at such a volume as to cause or incite a breach of the peace. Although as a court we may have chosen a different method to control excessive and unwelcome noise, we must defer to appellee\u2019s determination as to how its interests will best be served so long as .it is reasonable. <em>Rock Against Racism, </em>491 U.S. at 800, 109 S.Ct. 2746, 105 L.Ed.2d 661.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">{\u00b641} Finally, a time, place, or manner regulation must leave open ample alternative channels for communication of the information. Ord. 539.07(b)(1), part one, is not a complete ban on playing music from automobiles. It permits music to be played at any volume that does not disturb the peace of others, i.e., that does not cause or tend to incite a breach of the peace. Appellant had ample opportunity to play music from his car, albeit at a volume lower than that which would cause a disturbance of the peace. Furthermore, in respect to part one of Ord. 539.07(b)(1), appellant made no attempt to show that any of the alternate avenues of communication were inadequate. See <em>Taxpayers for Vincent, </em>supra, 466 U.S. at 812, 104 S.Ct. 2118, 80 L.Ed.2d 772. Therefore, the third requirement necessary to uphold a time, place, or manner regulation of speech has been fulfilled.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">{\u00b6 42} For all of the aforementioned reasons, we overrule appellant\u2019s sole assignment of error and affirm the judgment of the lower court.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b253-8\">Vukovich, P.J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b253-9\">Gene Donofrio, J., dissents.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b253-10\">Gene Donofrio, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A3K\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-11\">{\u00b6 43} I must respectfully dissent from the majority opinion herein. On June 2, 2000, appellant was cited for violating Youngstown Municipal Ordinance 539.07(b), the city\u2019s \u201cloud music\u201d ordinance. Appellant moved to dismiss the charge on constitutional grounds. The trial court denied the motion. On September 25, 2000, appellant entered a plea of no contest, and the court found him guilty. Since this was appellant\u2019s fourth conviction for violating the ordinance, the court sentenced him to 60 days in jail and a fine of $600. The court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>stayed appellant\u2019s sentence pending this appeal. Appellant filed his notice of appeal on October 17, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">{\u00b6 44} Appellant alleges a single assignment of error but makes three separate arguments in support. His assignment of error states:</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">{\u00b6 45} \u201cThe trial court erred by entering judgment against appellant since Section 539.07 of the Youngstown Municipal Ordinances is unconstitutional pursuant to the First, Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and Article I, Section 16 of the Ohio Constitution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">{\u00b6 46} Youngstown Municipal Ordinance 539.07(b)(1), under which appellant was convicted, states:</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">{\u00b6 47} \u201cNo person shall play any radio, music player or an audio system in a motor vehicle at such volume as to disturb the quiet, comfort or repose of other persons or at a volume which is plainly audible to persons other than the occupants of said vehicle.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b254-9\">{\u00b6 48} All legislative enactments enjoy a presumption of constitutionality. <em>State v. Anderson </em>(1991), 57 Ohio St.3d 168, 171, 566 N.E.2d 1224, <em>Benevolent Assn. v. Parma </em>(1980), 61 Ohio St.2d 375, 377, 15 O.O.3d 450, 402 N.E.2d 519. Furthermore, courts must apply all presumptions and pertinent rules of construction to uphold, if at all possible, a statute or ordinance alleged to be unconstitutional. <em>State v. Sinito </em>(1975), 43 Ohio St.2d 98, 101, 72 O.O.2d 54, 330 N.E.2d 896.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-10\">{\u00b6 49} Appellant\u2019s first argument in support of his claim that the ordinance is unconstitutional states:</p>\n<p id=\"b254-11\">{\u00b6 50} \u201cSection 539.07 of the Youngstown City Code is void for vagueness in that it does not sufficiently describe conduct so the defendant cannot objectively determine what action violates the ordinance\u2019s provision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>{\u00b6 51} Appellant argues that the ordinance in question is unconstitutionally vague. Specifically he asserts that the phrase \u201cplainly audible\u201d is capable of creating substantial confusion. Appellant quotes the definitions of \u201cplainly\u201d and \u201caudible\u201d from the American Heritage Dictionary. It defines the terms as \u201ceasily understood; clearly evident; uncomplicated; straightforward\u201d and \u201ccapable of being heard,\u201d respectively. Appellant argues that construing the ordinance in terms of these definitions would lead one to believe that the ordinance prohibits all noise that is \u201cplainly audible,\u201d including sirens from emergency vehicles. Appellant also argues that the ordinance provides the police with unfettered discretion in choosing whom to cite under the ordinance, since it does not specifically describe the conduct prohibited.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">{\u00b6 52} The United States Supreme Court has stated that \u201c \u2018the void-for-vagueness doctrine requires that a penal statute define the criminal offense with sufficient definiteness that ordinary people can understand what conduct is prohibited and in a manner that does not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Tanner </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 1, 3, 15 OBR 1, 472 N.E.2d 689, quoting <em>Kolender v. Lawson </em>(1983), 461 U.S. 352, 357, 103 S.Ct. 1855, 75 L.Ed.2d 903. Tanner adopted a tripartite analysis to determine whether a statute or ordinance is void for vagueness. Under the analysis, a court must consider whether the ordinance (1) provides fair warning to the ordinary citizen so he may comport his behavior with the dictates of the ordinance, (2) precludes arbitrary, capricious, and generally discriminatory enforcement by officials given too much authority and too few constraints, and (3) ensures that fundamental constitutionally protected freedoms are not unreasonably impinged on or inhibited. Id., citing <em>Grayned v. Rockford </em>(1972), 408 U.S. 104, 108-109, 92 S.Ct. 2294, 33 L.Ed.2d 222.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">{\u00b6 53} An ordinance is not necessarily void for vagueness merely because it could have been worded more precisely. <em>State v. Dorso </em>(1983), 4 Ohio St.3d 60, 61, 4 OBR 150, 446 N.E.2d 449. The Constitution does not mandate a burdensome specificity. Id. at 62, 4 OBR 150, 446 N.E.2d 449. As the United States Supreme Court observed in <em>Rose v. Locke </em>(1975), 423 U.S. 48, 49-50, 96 S.Ct. 243, 46 L.Ed.2d 185, the \u201cprohibition against excessive vagueness does not invalidate every statute which a reviewing court believes could have been drafted with greater precision. Many statutes will have some inherent vagueness, for \u2018[i]n most English words and phrases there lurk uncertainties.\u2019 <em>Robinson v. United States </em>[1945], 324 U.S. 282, 286 [65 S.Ct. 666, 89 L.Ed. 944].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">{\u00b6 54} A statute or ordinance need not define every word it uses. <em>Dorso, </em>4 Ohio St.3d at 62, 4 OBR 150, 446 N.E.2d 449. Terms that are undefined by the statute or ordinance are to be given their common, everyday meaning. Id. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>Webster\u2019s II New Riverside Dictionary defines \u201cplain\u201d as \u201cclearly evident: easily understood.\u201d It defines \u201caudible\u201d as \u201ccapable of being heard.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">{\u00b6 55} Applying the above standards and definitions to the ordinance at issue, it is apparent that the ordinance does not meet the test set out in <em>Tanner. </em>As to the first part of the analysis, the ordinance does not provide fair warning to ordinary citizens as to what volume on their car stereo constitutes criminal behavior. The common definitions of \u201cplainly\u201d and \u201caudible\u201d suggest that something is \u201cplainly audible\u201d if it is easily heard. This definition is wholly subjective. The ordinance makes no attempt to define the term \u201cplainly audible.\u201d It contains no requirements for distance or any other type of standard by which noise is to be measured. Furthermore, the ordinance fails to give guidance on such details as whether words must be discernible or whether mere bass reverberations are enough. Given the language of the ordinance, a person in his or her car cannot determine what volume of music is permissible under the ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">{\u00b6 56} Regarding the second part of the analysis, the ordinance gives officials too much authority and too few constraints. Appellant\u2019s assertion is correct that the ordinance gives police unfettered discretion to choose whom to cite. Whether an officer can clearly hear a motor vehicle\u2019s audio system outside the vehicle turns on who the particular officer is. What one officer considers \u201cplainly audible\u201d another officer may not even notice. Such discretion encourages discriminatory enforcement. Nothing in the ordinance provides officers with guidance in discerning what volume is \u201cplainly audible.\u201d The officers would greatly benefit from a distance requirement or decibel level to determine violations of the ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">{\u00b6 57} As to the final part of the analysis, the ordinance unreasonably inhibits fundamental, protected freedoms. The ordinance gives officers the authority to cite individuals for playing audio systems in their motor vehicles at a volume that is \u201cplainly audible.\u201d Since \u201cplainly audible\u201d is unclear as to what it prohibits, it is possible that citizens will be cited for engaging in protected speech activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-8\">{\u00b6 58} Given the above reasoning, the ordinance is unconstitutionally vague. For the reasons stated above, the decision of the trial court should be reversed and appellant\u2019s conviction vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-9\">{\u00b6 59} Based on the foregoing, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b254-12\">. {\u00b6 a} The ordinance was amended on February 7, 2001. Section (b) now reads:</p>\n<p id=\"b254-13\">{V b} \"(1) No person operating or occupying a motor vehicle upon any public road, street, highway or private properly shall operate or permit the operation of any sound amplification system from within the vehicle so as to disturb the quiet, comfort or repose of other persons, or at a volume that is plainly audible from outside of the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-14\">{\u00b6 c} \"(2) 'Sound amplification system\u2019 means any radio, tape player, compact disc, loudspeaker, speaker or other electronic device used for the amplification of musical instruments or other sounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-15\">{\u00b6 d} \"(3) \u2018Plainly audible\u2019 means any sound produced by a sound amplification system from within the vehicle that can clearly be heard outside the vehicle at a distance of fifty feet or more.
