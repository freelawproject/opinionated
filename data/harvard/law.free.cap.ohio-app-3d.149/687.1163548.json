She argues that compliance with the Hague Service Convention is mandatory for service of process by an American upon a German citizen even when (1) the German citizen has actual notice of a legal proceeding, and (2) a German lawyer, not admitted in Ohio and not admitted pro hac vice, filed a response. We agree. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b720-12\">{\u00b6 2} Darren E. Ward married Astrid, a German citizen, in Germany in 1987. They had three children \u2014 Ariane, born in 1987, Brandon, born in 1988, and Dominic (a.k.a. Domenic), born in 1993. Sometime after the family settled in Ohio, Astrid returned to Germany with Dominic. Darren filed a complaint for divorce against Astrid and served her in Germany by registered mail with a copy of the complaint and related papers. The returned receipt shows that Astrid received the papers. No one personally appeared on her behalf. However, a German lawyer did send purported pleadings on her behalf, even though he was not admitted to the practice of law in Ohio and was not admitted pro hac vice. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>Eventually, the trial court entered a default judgment, which granted Darren a divorce, imposed certain financial obligations on Astrid, and granted Darren custody of all three children even though Dominic was still living in Germany with Astrid.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">{\u00b6 3} Astrid, through Ohio counsel, entered an appearance for the limited purpose of contesting the court\u2019s jurisdiction and filed a petition to vacate the judgment. She argued that Darren did not serve her by following the Hague Service Convention requirements. The trial court found that Darren complied with Civ.R. 4.5 and that in her divorce pleadings Astrid (1) did not assert the defense of lack of jurisdiction, (2) requested that the divorce be granted, and (3) agreed to Darren\u2019s having custody of Ariane and Brandon. Consequently, the trial court denied Astrid\u2019s motion to vacate.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">{\u00b6 4} Astrid appeals and raises the following assignment of error: \u201cThe Trial Court erred to the substantial prejudice of defendant-appellant Astrid Ward-Ludwig when it failed to vacate the divorce decree despite the fact that Ms. Ward-Ludwig was never properly served with the complaint and summons in compliance with the \u2018Hague Service Convention,\u2019 20 UST 361, TIAS 6638, 658 UNTS 163, and therefore the trial court lacked jurisdiction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b721-8\">{\u00b6 5} Astrid argues that the trial court erred when it found that Darren did not have to comply with the Hague Service Convention. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-9\">{\u00b6 6} \u201cAn Ohio court has inherent power to vacate its own void judgment, irrespective of authority provided by Civ.R. 60(B).\u201d <em>Demianczuk v. Demianczuk </em>(1984), 20 Ohio App.3d 244, 245, 20 OBR 305, 485 N.E.2d 785, citing <em>Westmoreland v. Valley Homes Corp. </em>(1975), 42 Ohio St.2d 291, 294, 71 O.O.2d 262, 328 N.E.2d 406; <em>Lincoln Tavern, Inc. v. Snader </em>(1956), 165 Ohio St. 61, 69, 59 O.O. 74, 133 N.E.2d 606. Thus, \u201c[a] motion to vacate a void judgment need not satisfy the requirements of Civ.R. 60(B)[.]\u201d Id. \u201c \u2018It is axiomatic that for a court to acquire jurisdiction there must be a proper service of summons or an entry of appearance, and a judgment rendered without proper service or entry of appearance is a nullity and void.\u2019 \u201d <em>State ex rel. Ballard v. O'Donnell </em>(1990), 50 Ohio St.3d 182, 183, 553 N.E.2d 650, quoting <em>Lincoln Tavern, </em>supra, at 64, 59 O.O. 74, 133 N.E.2d 606.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-10\">{\u00b6 7} The Hague Service Convention is an international treaty. The United States ratified the treaty in 1969, West Germany in 1979. <em>Lyman Steel Corp. v. Ferrostaal Metals Corp. </em>(N.D.Ohio 1990), 747 F.Supp. 389, 399. See, also, <em>Rhodes v. J.P. Sauer &amp; Sohn, Inc. </em>(W.D.La.2000), 98 F.Supp.2d 746, 748 (the United States and Germany signed the treaty). This ratified treaty is now \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>supreme Law of the Land\u201d and every state judge shall be bound by it. Clause 2, Article VI, United States Constitution. This international treaty applies to civil cases \u201cwhere there is occasion to transmit a judicial or extrajudicial document for service abroad}.]\u201d <em>Lyman Steel Corp. </em>at 399, quoting 20 U.S.T. at 362, Article 1. The drafters of the treaty tried \u201cto provide a simpler way to serve process abroad, to assure that defendants sued in foreign jurisdictions would receive actual and timely notice of suit, and to facilitate proof of service abroad.\u201d <em>Volkswagenwerk Aktiengesellschaft v. Schlunk </em>(1988), 486 U.S. 694, 698, 108 S.Ct. 2104, 100 L.Ed.2d 722.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">{\u00b6 8} Article 10 of the treaty provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cProvided the State of destination does not object, the present Convention shall not interfere with\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">{\u00b6 10} \u201c(a) the freedom to send judicial documents, by postal channels, directly to persons abroad,</p>\n<p id=\"b722-8\">{\u00b6 11} \u201c(b) the freedom of judicial officers, officials or other competent persons of the State of origin to effect service of judicial documents directly through the judicial officers, officials or other competent persons of the State of destination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b722-9\">{\u00b6 12} Article 21 allows ratifying states to reject certain provisions and add others. West Germany chose to reject Article 10 and follow Article 5. <em>Lyman Steel Corp. </em>at 400. Article 5 \u201cestablishes a central authority to receive service of documents; and requires the papers served by the central authority to be written in or translated into one of the official languages of the nation addressed}.]\u201d Id. at 399.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-10\">{\u00b6 13} Here, Astrid is a German citizen. Thus, Darren had to follow Article 5 of the Hague Service Convention. Darren had to send the complaint and related papers to a central authority that would serve Astrid only if the papers were\u2019 translated into German. Hence, the trial court erred when ,it denied Astrid\u2019s motion to vacate.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-11\">{\u00b6 14} Darren argues that even if he had to comply with the Hague Service Convention, Astrid received actual notice, understands the English language, and had a German lawyer file an answer to the complaint. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-12\">{\u00b6 15} Like the court in <em>Lyman Steel Corp., </em>we do not think that a trial court should have to determine on a case-by-case basis whether a defendant and her foreign lawyer understand enough of the English language so that they can interpret legal documents. Here, we would have to guess whether Astrid and her German lawyer understand English well enough to interpret the complaint and related papers. We do not know whether the German lawyer prepared the answer to the complaint with a true understanding of the documents and Ohio <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>law. He prepared the answer in German and stated that a translation would follow, which it did. However, he was not admitted as an attorney-at-law in the state of Ohio and was not admitted pro hac vice. Hence, he was not allowed to make an appearance on Astrid\u2019s behalf. R.C. 4705.01. Consequently, actual notice of the complaint and related papers written in the English language and served by registered mail to Astrid is insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">{\u00b6 16} In addition, even if we assume that Astrid waived personal jurisdiction by filing an answer, or that she is estopped from benefiting from her counsel\u2019s unauthorized practice of law, the requirement in Article 5 that a central authority in Germany receive service of documents gives Germany .the opportunity to decide whether it wants to participate in the lawsuit or help its citizen in some other way. Here, for example, Germany filed an amicus brief in this appellate court in support of its citizen, Astrid. Germany did not have an opportunity to try to participate in the original action in the trial court because Darren did not send it notice.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">{\u00b6 17} Accordingly, we sustain Astrid\u2019s sole assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b723-8\">{\u00b6 18} In conclusion, we sustain Astrid\u2019s assignment of error and reverse the judgment of the trial court. We vacate the trial court\u2019s divorce decree filed on September 17, 2001, because it is null and void. This cause is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-9\">Judgment reversed, divorce decree vacated and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b723-10\">Evans, J., concurs in judgment only.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b723-11\">Harsha, J., dissents.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b723-14\">. An example of a law that requires notice on a nonparty is R.C. 2721.12, which requires the service of notice on the Attorney General before the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction is invoked over issues of a statute's constitutionality in a declaratory judgment action. See, e.g., <em>Cicco v. Stockmaster </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 95, 728 N.E.2d 1066 (interpreting former R.C. 2721.12). See, also, <em>Cleveland Bar Assn. v.
