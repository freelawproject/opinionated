Pelphrey drove to 457 Samoht Ridge in Delhi Township, where a party was in progress. Pelphrey threw sulfuric acid on four of the people who were attending the party. The four victims suffered serious injuries that resulted in scars and permanent disfigurement. Pelphrey\u2019s mother, Belinda Euliss, was also splashed with the sulfuric acid during the attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-10\">{\u00b6 2} Pelphrey was indicted for ten counts of felonious assault. Counts 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 charged that Pelphrey had knowingly caused serious physical harm to each victim, in violation of R.C. 2903.11(A)(1). Counts 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 charged that Pelphrey had knowingly caused or attempted to cause physical harm to each victim by means of a deadly weapon or dangerous ordnance, in violation of R.C. 2903.11(A)(2). Counts 9 and 10 named Pelphrey\u2019s mother, Belinda Euliss, as the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-11\">{\u00b6 3} Pelphrey pleaded guilty to counts 1, 3, 5, and 7. The remaining counts were dismissed. The trial court sentenced Pelphrey to four years\u2019 incarceration on each count and ordered the sentences to be served consecutively. Pelphrey appealed his convictions on July 12,'2001, under the case numbered C-010452.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-12\">{\u00b6 4} On September 4, 2001, Pelphrey, now represented by new counsel, filed a motion in the trial court captioned \u201cmotion for leave to withdraw guilty pleas and alternative petition for postconviction relief pursuant to R.C. 2953.21 et seq.\u201d Attached to Pelphrey\u2019s motion were copies of Hamilton County Municipal Court records showing that while Pelphrey\u2019s original trial counsel was representing him on the instant charges in the court of common pleas, the attorney was also representing Belinda Euliss in the municipal court on criminal charges. Pel-phrey argued that his attorney\u2019s representation of one of the alleged victims, who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>was a potential witness for the prosecution against Pelphrey, gave rise to an actual conflict of interest that violated his constitutional rights to due process, equal protection, and effective assistance of counsel, and that constituted a manifest miscarriage of justice within the meaning of Crim.R. 32.1. The possible conflict of interest was not brought to the trial court\u2019s attention until Pelphrey filed his motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">{\u00b6 5} The trial court entered an order, on October 22, 2001, entitled \u201cfindings of fact, conclusions of law, and entry denying postconviction relief.\u201d The court dismissed the petition for postconviction relief, finding that \u201call questions raised can be resolved from the existing record\u201d and that, therefore, \u201cno evidentiary hearing [would] be held.\u201d The trial court held that res judicata barred the claim of conflict of interest because it \u201ccould have been raised at trial, sentence, or on appeal.\u201d The trial court did not separately rule on Pelphrey\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty pleas, but, under its conclusions of law, the trial court, citing <em>State v. Xie </em>(1992), 62 Ohio St.3d 521, 584 N.E.2d 715, stated that the \u201c[defendant has failed to establish that there is a reasonable and legitimate basis for the withdrawal of the plea[s].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">{\u00b6 6} Pelphrey has appealed from the dismissal of his motion under the case numbered C-010702. This court has consolidated the appeals. Pelphrey has raised two assignments of error for our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">{\u00b6 7} Pelphrey\u2019s first assignment of error alleges:</p>\n<p id=\"b614-8\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cThe trial court erred to the substantial prejudice of the defendant by accepting his plea[s] of guilty when his attorney was also representing the victim of the offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b614-9\">{\u00b6 9} The Sixth Amendment right to counsel guarantees a defendant\u2019s right to conflict-free assistance of counsel. See <em>Glasser v. United States </em>(1942), 315 U.S. 60, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680; <em>State v. Haberek </em>(1988), 47 Ohio App.3d 35, 546 N.E.2d 1361. \u201cA lawyer represents conflicting interests when, on behalf of one client, it is his duty to contend for that which duty to another client requires him to oppose.\u201d <em>State v. Manross </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 180, 182, 532 N.E.2d 735.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-10\">{\u00b6 10} In <em>State v. Gillard </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 304, 595 N.E.2d 878, syllabus, the Ohio Supreme Court held:</p>\n<p id=\"b614-11\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cWhere a trial court knows or reasonably should know of an attorney\u2019s possible conflict of interest in the representation of a person charged with a crime, the trial court has an affirmative duty to inquire whether a conflict of interest actually exists. The duty to inquire arises not only from the general principles of fundamental fairness, but from the principle that where there is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>right to counsel, there is a correlative right to representation free from conflicts of interest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b615-4\">{\u00b6 12} The trial court and defense counsel have an affirmative duty to ensure the defendant a conflict-free representation. See <em>State v. Dillon </em>(1995), 74 Ohio St.3d 166, 657 N.E.2d 273. A defendant who has not objected in the trial court on the basis of a conflict of interest need not show prejudice on appeal. Prejudice is presumed if the defendant can demonstrate that his defense counsel actively represented conflicting interests and that the actual conflict of interest adversely affected counsel\u2019s performance. See <em>Cuyler v. Sullivan </em>(1980), 446 U.S. 335, 100 S.Ct. 1708, 64 L.Ed.2d 333; <em>State v. Carroll </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 229, 658 N.E.2d 269; <em>State v. Haberek, </em>47 Ohio App.3d at 38-39, 546 N.E.2d 1361.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">{\u00b6 13} In reviewing a claim of conflict of interest, an appellate court must first determine whether the trial court had a duty to investigate the alleged conflict of interest. See <em>State v. Gillard, </em>supra; <em>State v. Ingol </em>(1993), 89 Ohio App.3d 45, 48, 623 N.E.2d 598. The trial court is constitutionally required to inquire into the possibility of a conflict of interest when it knows or should know that a possible conflict of interest exists. See <em>State v. Gillard, </em>supra; <em>State v. Manross, </em>supra. If the trial court has failed to make an inquiry where it had a duty to do so, the case must be remanded to the trial court for a determination of whether an actual conflict of interest existed. See id. The trial court has \u201cwide latitude\u201d in determining whether an actual conflict of interest existed. See <em>State v. Keenan </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 133, 689 N.E.2d 929.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">{\u00b6 14} We hold that the trial court had a duty in this case to inquire into the alleged conflict of interest when Pelphrey filed his Crim.R. 32.1 motion to withdraw his guilty pleas or in the alternative for postconviction relief, because at that time the court knew or should have known that a possible conflict of interest existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cPostsentence motions to withdraw guilty or no contest pleas and postconviction relief petitions exist independently.\u201d <em>State v. Bush, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 235, 2002-Ohio-3993, 773 N.E.2d 522, at \u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">{\u00b6 16} \u201cA defendant who seeks to withdraw a plea of guilty after the imposition of sentence has the burden of establishing the existence of manifest injustice.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-9\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cA motion made pursuant to Crim.R. 32.1 is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court, and the good faith, credibility and weight of the movant\u2019s assertions in support of the motion are matters to be resolved by that court.\u201d <em>State v. Smith </em>(1977), 49 Ohio St.2d 261, 3 O.O.3d 402, 361 N.E.2d 1324, paragraphs one and two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>{\u00b6 18} We hold that, under the facts of this case, the trial court was required to hold a hearing to determine whether an actual conflict of interest existed, and, if so, whether the conflict of interest worked a \u201cmanifest injustice\u201d upon Pel-phrey. Pelphrey would have then had the burden to establish the existence of manifest injustice.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">{\u00b6 19} The first assignment of error is sustained to the extent that it alleges that the trial court erred in dismissing Pelphrey\u2019s Crim.R. 32.1 motion to withdraw his guilty pleas without holding a hearing. It is overruled in all other respects. The cause must be remanded for a hearing on Pelphrey\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">{\u00b6 20} Pelphrey has not raised an assignment of error alleging that the trial court erred in overruling his petition for postconviction relief. We point out that Pelphrey\u2019s claim of conflict of interest was raised on direct appeal, and, therefore, that he is barred by the doctrine of res judicata from raising the claim in his postconviction petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">{\u00b6 21} Pelphrey\u2019s second assignment of error alleges that the trial court erred in imposing consecutive sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-8\">{\u00b6 22} R.C. 2929.14(E)(4) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b616-9\">{\u00b6 23} \u201cIf multiple prison terms are imposed on an offender for convictions of multiple offenses, the court may require the offender to serve the prison terms consecutively if the court finds that the consecutive service is necessary to protect the public from future crime or to punish the offender and that consecutive sentences are not disproportionate to the seriousness of the offender\u2019s conduct and to the danger the offender poses to the public, and if the court also finds any of the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b616-10\">{\u00b6 24} \u201c(a) The offender committed the multiple offenses while the offender was awaiting trial or sentencing, was under a sanction imposed pursuant to section 2929.16, 2929.17, or 2929.18 of the Revised Code, or was under post-release control for a prior offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-11\">{\u00b6 25} \u201c(b) The harm caused by the multiple offenses was so great or unusual that no single prison term for any of the offenses committed as part of a single course of conduct adequately reflects the seriousness of the offender\u2019s conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-12\">{\u00b6 26} \u201c(c) The offender\u2019s history of criminal conduct demonstrates that consecutive sentences are necessary to protect the public from future crimes by the offender.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b616-13\">{\u00b6 27} Pursuant to R.C. 2929.19(B)(2)(c), the trial court must make the requisite findings and give its reasons for imposing consecutive sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>{\u00b6 28} The record here does not contain a sentencing worksheet. In imposing consecutive sentences, the trial court stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">{\u00b6 29} \u201cMr. Pelphrey, I\u2019ve been on the bench 32 years and been on a lot of capital death penalty cases; lot of shootings, weapons, guns and knives.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">{\u00b6 30} \u201cIt would probably seem to be almost better if you had used a gun or knife. The terrible destruction that something like this has cost everyone, and what I indicated before, you destroyed your own life, your family\u2019s life, and all of these people\u2019s lives and their families.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">{\u00b6 31} \u201cI do want to make the necessary findings for the sentencing guidelines that there are prior delinquencies and prior adult convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-8\">{\u00b6 32} \u201cI do find with regard to Section [2929.14(E)(4) ] that the harm that was caused was great and/or unusual, and that consecutive sentences are necessary to fulfill the purposes of Revised Code 2929.11.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b617-9\">{\u00b6 33} The trial court effectively found that \u201cconsecutive service is necessary to protect the public from future crime or to punish the offender\u201d when it stated that consecutive sentences were necessary to fulfill the purposes of R.C. 2929.11. See <em>State v. Terry </em>(Dec. 14, 2001), 1st Dist. No. C-000782, 2001 WL 1591327. R.C. 2929.11 provides that the \u201coverriding purposes of felony sentencing are to protect the public from future crime by the offender and others and to punish the offender.\u201d The trial court also found that the harm caused was great or unusual, a determination fully supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-10\">{\u00b6 34} The court did not make a finding that \u201cconsecutive sentences [were] not disproportionate to the seriousness of the offender\u2019s conduct and to the danger the offender pose[d] to the public,\u201d as required by R.C. 2929.14(E)(4). Further, the trial court failed to give reasons for its findings as required by R.C. 2929.19(B)(2)(c). In the absence of those findings and reasons, the imposition of consecutive sentences was contrary to law. See id.; <em>State v. McCoy </em>(Nov. 9, 2001), 1st Dist. Nos. C-000659 and C-000660, 2001 WL 1386196. The second assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-11\">{\u00b6 35} Therefore, the judgment of conviction is reversed to the extent that it imposes consecutive sentences, those sentences are vacated, and the cause is remanded to the trial court for resentencing in accordance with law. Further, the trial court\u2019s judgment dismissing Pelphrey\u2019s Crim.R. 32.1 motion without a hearing is reversed, and the cause is remanded for a hearing on Pelphrey\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty pleas in which the trial court must consider whether an actual conflict of interest existed and, if so, whether the conflict of interest worked a manifest injustice upon Pelphrey, and for further proceedings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>consistent with law and this decision. The judgment of the trial court is affirmed in all other respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">Judgment affirmed in part, reversed in part and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b618-5\">Gorman and Winkler, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
