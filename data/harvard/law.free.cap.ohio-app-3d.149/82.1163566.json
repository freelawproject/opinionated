Corrigan, Presiding Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b115-16\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b115-17\">{\u00b6 1} This case came to be heard upon the accelerated calendar pursuant to App.R. 11.1 and Loc.R. 11.1, the file from the criminal court, the transcript from the sentencing hearing of December 14, 2001, and briefs of counsel. Defendant-appellant Nadeel Othman\u2019s motion to. supplement the record with the victim\u2019s medical records was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-18\">{\u00b6 2} Othman was originally indicted on four counts following the sexual assault of a sixteen year old. Othman participated in the assault with others who were also charged but who are not parties to this appeal. After a plea bargain, three of the four counts against Othman were nolled and he ultimately pled guilty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>to the one remaining count: sexual battery, a violation of R.C. 2907.03, which is a third-degree felony. After a sentencing hearing, the trial court sentenced Othman to the maximum sentence of five years. Othman appeals his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">{\u00b6 3} Specifically, Othman argues that (1) the trial court failed to engage in the proper analysis when it decided against imposing the minimum sentence; (2) the trial court failed to state its reasons on the record when it imposed the maximum sentence; (3) the trial court improperly considered offenses that were nolled and that the prison sentence is not supported by the record; and (4) the trial court failed to make the requisite finding that the presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI report\u201d) contained an inaccuracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">1 and 2</p>\n<p id=\"b116-8\">(\u00b6 4} A court imposing a sentence on a felony offender who has not previously served a prison term must \u201cimpose the shortest prison term authorized for the offense * * * unless the court finds on the record that the shortest prison term will demean the seriousness of the offender\u2019s conduct or will not adequately protect the public from future crime by the offender or others.\u201d R.C. 2929.14(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-10\">{\u00b6 5} Further, a court imposing the maximum sentence upon a felony offender may do so \u201conly upon,\u201d among others, \u201coffenders who committed the worst forms of the offense[.]\u201d R.C. 2929.14(C). And courts that impose the maximum sentence must provide reasons for doing so. R.C. 2929.19(B)(2)(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-11\">{\u00b6 6} During the sentencing hearing, the court stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b116-12\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cHowever, before I sentence you, I have to look at certain factors when I sentence you. And I am first required by law to consider the minimum sentence, because you have no prior felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-13\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cAnd I don\u2019t believe that a one-year sentence [the minimum] in this case would appropriately punish you or protect society by giving you the minimum sentence. I think giving you the shortest sentence would demean what happened to the victim and her family in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-14\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cAs I said before, I believe that this is one of the worst forms of the offense that I have ever seen. And the reason that I say that is technically I am looking at you as a sexual battery, but from the review of the reports and the review of the statements from the victim and from her family, what happened to her is outrageous. The damage to this girl\u2019s rectum, to her vagina. She had a cut nipple. She had bruises on her body. She said that you guys put drugs into her, or your friends put drugs into her and you basically gang raped her.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>{\u00b6 10} \u201cAnd one of the reasons that there was a plea agreement in this case was the medical condition of the mother in this case was a huge consideration. This is what I was told.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cThis victim has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress syndrome. She was in Lakewood Hospital after an attempt to commit suicide as a result of what you guys did to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cSo yes, this is one of the worst forms of the offense, and, yes, I document that for the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cSo I am going to sentence you on Count Two of this indictment to five years [the maximum] at Lorain Correctional Institution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b117-8\">{\u00b6 14} The court met the statutory requirements for imposing the sentences. Specifically, the court found that the minimum sentence would not \u201cappropriately punish you or protect society by giving you the minimum sentence. I think giving you the shortest sentence would demean what happened to the victim and her family in this case.\u201d Therefore, the court appropriately sentenced Othman to more than the minimum sentence. R.C. 2929.14(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-9\">{\u00b6 15} Further, the court found, \u201cI believe that this is one of the worst forms of the offense that I have ever seen.\u201d The court then stated its reasons for imposing the maximum sentence, describing the physical and psychological harm suffered by the victim and the nature and circumstances of the assault. Therefore, the trial court met the statutory requirements for imposing the maximum sentences. R.C. 2929.14(C); R.C. 2929.19(B)(2)(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-10\">3</p>\n<p id=\"b117-11\">{\u00b6 16} There is nothing in the record to suggest that the trial court considered the nolled offenses in determining the sentence. Further, Othman has failed to show how the five-year sentence, which is allowed under the relevant statute for third-degree felonies, is contrary to law. Finally, Othman\u2019s argument that his sentence is not supported by clear and convincing evidence is unpersuasive. Othman pled guilty to sexual battery, and the judge listed the circumstances surrounding the assault itself and the damage, both physical and psychological, suffered by the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-12\">4</p>\n<p id=\"b117-13\"> {\u00b6 17} R.C. 2951.03(B)(5) requires that when the defense alleges any inaccuracy in a PSI report, the court must either (a) \u201cmake a finding as to the allegations\u201d or (b) \u201cmake a determination that no finding is necessary * * * because the factual matter will not be taken into account in the sentencing of the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>{\u00b6 18} Here, defense counsel brought to the court\u2019s attention the factual inaccuracy in the PSI report. The report stated that Othman had five previous misdemeanor convictions when, in fact, he had only one. This colloquy followed:</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">{\u00b6 19} \u201cTHE COURT: So the only prior conviction that he has is disorderly conduct from March of 2000?</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">{\u00b6 20} \u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: That is correct, your Honor.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">{\u00b6 21} \u201cTHE COURT: All right.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">{\u00b6 22} We hold that, although the court did not expressly say, \u201cI make the following finding,\u201d the court did find on the record the error in the PSI report. It is clear from the transcript that the court understood that the PSI report contained the error and that Othman had previously been convicted of only one misdemeanor. Further, there is nothing in the record that suggests that the trial court took into consideration the improperly reported misdemeanors when imposing sentence. Therefore, even if we were to hold that the trial court did not make the required finding, the failure would be, at most, harmless error. See, e.g., <em>State v. Griffin </em>(Feb. 12, 1998), Washington App. No. 97CA17, 1998 WL 102584.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-9\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b118-10\">{\u00b6 23} We hold that Othman\u2019s assignments of error are not well taken and therefore affirm the decision of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-11\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b118-12\">Terrence O\u2019Donnell, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b118-13\">Colleen Conway Cooney, J., concurs in judgment only.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b118-14\">Colleen Conway Cooney, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A8\">concurring in judgment only.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-15\">{\u00b6 24} I concur with the majority\u2019s decision to affirm the sentence imposed by the trial court. However, I write separately because I believe that it was an error for this court to deny Othman\u2019s motion to supplement the record with the victim\u2019s medical records.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-16\">{\u00b6 25} On appeal, it is our duty to determine whether by clear and convincing evidence the sentence is supported by the record. R.C. 2953.08(G). Further, when a trial court\u2019s sentencing decision is appealed, \u201cthe record to review shall include all of the following, as applicable: any presentence, psychiatric or other investigative report * * * the trial record * * * [and] any oral or written statements made to or by the court\u2019at the sentencing hearing.\u201d R.C. 2953.08(F).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>{\u00b6 26} Here, the trial court specifically referred to the victim\u2019s medical report and purportedly relied on the findings therein while making its sentencing decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">{\u00b6 27} Othman maintains that the hospital records do not support the facts relied on by the trial court in its determination that Othman\u2019s actions constituted the worst form of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">{\u00b6 28} As noted by the majority, when imposing the maximum sentence the trial court described the physical and psychological harm suffered by the victim. The court made the following findings:</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">{\u00b6 29} \u201cThe damage to this girl\u2019s rectum, to her vagina. She had a cut nipple. She had bruises on her body. She said that you guys put drugs into her, or your friends put drugs into her and you basically all gang raped her. * * * This victim has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress syndrome. She was in Lakewood Hospital after an attempt to commit suicide as a result of what you guys did to her. So yes, this is one of the worst forms of the offense, and yes, I document that for the record.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b119-8\">{\u00b6 30} It is true' that the record does not support all of the trial court\u2019s findings regarding the extent of injuries suffered by the victim. First, the suicide attempt and psychological hospitalization referred to by the trial court occurred prior to the incident in question. Further, the record is silent as to any psychological diagnosis other than depression, from which the victim has suffered since the age of seven. Accordingly, the trial court erred in attributing these consequences to Othman\u2019s actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-9\">{\u00b6 31} Next, although the medical report notes that the victim had microtears to her vagina, it also lists the condition of her vagina as \u201cnormal.\u201d Further, the report notes that there were \u201cno tears or abrasions\u201d to her labia, hymen, anus, or rectum. Thus, the trial court erred in stating that these injuries existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-10\">{\u00b6 32} Nonetheless, the medical report does show that the victim had bruises and scrapes on her elbows, knees, back, thigh, and breast. The report also noted that the victim appeared distraught and tearful. Thus, there was evidence to support a finding that the victim suffered physical and psychological harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-11\">{\u00b6 33} The majority states that the trial court also described the circumstances of the assault to support her finding that Othman committed the worst form of the offense. However, the trial court unfortunately did not describe the circumstances of the offense, and it is these circumstances which support a finding that this was the worst form of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-12\">{\u00b6 34} The circumstances supporting the court\u2019s finding are that the victim in this case was sixteen years old, she was highly intoxicated when taken to an apartment where several males took sexual advantage of her, and she suffered</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>physical harm. Clearly, the circumstances of this case support the trial court\u2019s finding that this was the worst form of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">{\u00b6 35} Despite the factual errors made by the trial court during sentencing, sufficient reasons exist that support a finding that this was the worst form of the offense. Accordingly, I concur with the majority\u2019s decision to affirm the trial court\u2019s imposition of the maximum sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
