For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-12\">{\u00b62} In 1998, Citicasters entered into negotiations to buy WRBP, a radio station in Youngstown, Ohio, from a company called Stop 26. One of the shareholders of Stop 26 was Percy Squire, who was also a partner in Bricker &amp; Eckler, a law firm based in Columbus, Ohio. Bricker &amp; Eckler, acting through Squire, represented Stop 26 in the negotiations. In May 1998, Citicasters entered into an asset purchase agreement (\u201cAPA\u201d) with Stop 26 and its individual shareholders for the sale of the station. At the same time, Citicasters advanced $775,000 to Stop 26 to secure the release of liens against the radio station. That advance was made pursuant to a \u201csecurity agreement\u201d under which Citicasters received a subordinated security interest in Stop 26\u2019s assets. Citicasters made three subsequent cash advances pursuant to amendments to the security agreement and the APA.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-13\">{\u00b6 3} The parties, though, were ultimately unable to consummate the sale of the station under the APA. Citicasters then filed suit against Bricker &amp; Eckler, alleging that it had made misrepresentations concerning the financial status of Stop 26 and that Citicasters had relied on those misrepresentations in entering into the APA and in advancing funds to Stop 26 to facilitate the transaction. Specifically, Citicasters alleged that Bricker &amp; Eckler, through Squire, had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>misrepresented the amount of money necessary to obtain the release of liens on the radio station as well as the station\u2019s financial ability to secure the release of those liens. Citicasters further alleged that Bricker <em>&amp; </em>Eckler had made misrepresentations about the willingness of senior creditors to release the liens upon payment of certain amounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">{\u00b6 4} Bricker &amp; Eckler moved for judgment on the pleadings. The firm argued, inter alia, that the APA was an integrated document and that the parol evidence rule prohibited recovery based upon the alleged misrepresentations, which were not incorporated into the written agreement. The trial court -granted Bricker &amp; Eckler\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\"> {\u00b6 5} On appeal, Citicasters now argues, in a single assignment of error, that the trial court erred in granting judgment on the pleadings. Pursuant to Civ.R. 12(C), judgment on the pleadings is proper where the court construes as true the material allegations in the complaint, with all reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom, in favor of the plaintiff and concludes, beyond doubt, that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts to support the claim for relief.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We review de novo the granting or denial of a motion for judgment on the pleadings.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">{\u00b6 6} In support of its assignment of error, Citicasters argues that the parol evidence rule had no application to the misrepresentations allegedly made by Squire and that there were sufficient allegations in the complaint to establish justifiable reliance on those misrepresentations. We are not persuaded by these arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-8\">{\u00b6 7} The parol evidence rule is a rule of substantive law intended to protect the integrity of final, written agreements.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> If contracting parties integrate their negotiations into an unambiguous and final written agreement, any evidence of prior or contemporaneous negotiations, understandings, promises, or representations relating to the terms of the final agreement are generally excluded from consideration by the court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b741-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>{\u00b6 8} Although there is authority for the proposition that a party may offer evidence of prior or contemporaneous representations to prove fraud in the execution or in the inducement of an agreement, this exception to the parol evidence rule is not without limit. As this court has held, \u201c[pjarties may not prove fraud by claiming that the inducement to enter into an agreement was a promise that was within the scope of the integrated agreement but was ultimately not included in it.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b741-4\">{\u00b6 9} In <em>Bollinger, Inc. v. Mayerson, </em>the principal shareholder of a corporation entered into agreements whereby the assets of the' corporation would be transferred to a new corporation formed for the purpose of completing the asset purchase.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The purchase agreement was memorialized in written contracts with integration clauses.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Under the terms of the written agreements, Marilyn Bollinger, the principal shareholder in the old corporation, was to be employed by the new corporation, and the old corporation was to receive royalties to satisfy promissory notes to the old corporation\u2019s minority shareholders.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">{\u00b6 10} After the new corporation had failed, Bollinger and the old corporation sued Manuel D. Mayerson, the sole shareholder of the new corporation, for fraud and breach of an oral contract.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> They claimed that Mayerson had fraudulently induced them into executing the contract by promising to provide limitless funding for the new corporation.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We rejected that argument, stating the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cThe substance of the alleged oral promise is clearly within the scope of the integrated agreements. The agreements related to all aspects of the sale of the assets of Old Company to New Company, including Bollinger\u2019s employment and Bollinger, Inc.\u2019s royalty payments. * * * The substance of the alleged oral promise is part and parcel of the subject matter contained in the integrated agreements, that is, the terms of the transfer of the assets of Old Company to New Company. Therefore, Bollinger and Bollinger, Inc. cannot contradict the terms of the written contract by evidence of the alleged oral promise. Further, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>under the facts of this case, Bollinger could not have justifiably relied on any alleged oral promise on the part of Mayerson to fund New Company without limit.\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">{\u00b6 12} We hold that the instant case is controlled by <em>Bollinger. </em>Here, the parties had expressly provided that the written APA was an integrated document. In the APA, the parties recited that \u201c[t]his agreement and the exhibits hereto embody the entire agreement and understanding of the parties hereto and supersede any and all prior agreements, arrangements and understandings relating to the matter herein.\u201d The APA explicitly noted the existence of the liens on the radio station and placed the onus of securing the release of the liens on Stop 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">{\u00b6 13} But the contract did not include the representations alleged to have been made by Squire concerning the creditors\u2019 willingness to accept lesser amounts for the release of the liens and did not include any representations about Stop 26\u2019s ability to secure the release of the liens. The APA merely made the release of the liens a condition to closing. As was the case in <em>Bollinger, </em>the representations in the instant case were squarely within the scope of the written contract but were not included in the document. Therefore, Citicasters could not contradict the terms of the contract with the alleged representations and could not claim that it had justifiably relied on those representations.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-7\">{\u00b6 14} Citicasters further argues that, even if the representations could not contradict or alter the terms of the APA, the agreements pursuant to which Citicasters made cash advances to Stop 26 were not integrated documents and therefore were not subject to the parol evidence rule. We disagree. For each of the advances made following the execution of the APA,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> the parties agreed to amend the APA and specifically provided that the remaining terms of the agreement would remain in effect. The parties also amended the security agreement to reflect the new advances but retained that contract\u2019s integration clause. Thus, the advances from Citicasters to Stop 26 were made within the framework of the prior agreements and were subject to their integration clauses. Because the amendments to the APA and the security agreement did not contain the representations allegedly made by Squire, the rule set forth in <em>Bollinger </em>precluded recovery based upon those representations.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-8\">{\u00b6 15} Citicasters next argues that Bricker &amp; Eckler was not entitled to invoke the parol evidence rule because the firm was not a party to the APA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>and the related agreements. Citicasters is correct in asserting that \u201cstrangers\u201d to a contract are generally not permitted to invoke the rule.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Nonetheless, Bricker &amp; Eckler was not a stranger to the contract under the very theory of recovery asserted by Citicasters. Citicasters asserted that Bricker <em>&amp; </em>Eckler was vicariously liable for the actions of one of its partners, Squire, who was a signatory to the contract and also a shareholder and the legal representative of Stop 26. The theory of vicarious liability necessarily assumed that Squire was acting within his duties as an agent of Bricker <em>&amp; </em>Eckler when he engaged in the transactions that were the subject of Citicasters\u2019 claims. In view of its own theory of liability, Citicasters cannot simultaneously be heard to assert that Bricker &amp; Eckler was a \u201cstranger\u201d to the contract.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> This conclusion is bolstered by the Supreme Court of Ohio\u2019s statement that the parol evidence rule may be invoked by a party or its privies.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Finally, under established principles of agency law, the principal is entitled to assert any defense that the agent would be entitled to assert.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Here, it is beyond dispute that Squire, as a party to the contract and as a shareholder of Stop 26, would have been entitled to invoke the parol evidence rule. Bricker &amp; Eckler, as principal, was entitled to the same defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">{\u00b6 16} Finally, Citicasters contends that it was entitled to present parol evidence under the holding of the Supreme Court of Ohio in <em>Galmish v. Cicchini.</em><footnotemark><em>17</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In <em>Galmish, </em>the parties entered into a contract for the sale of an office building.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Pursuant to the written agreement, the buyer promised to pay the seller one-half of all proceeds in excess of $765,000 if the property were conveyed to developers within one year.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The property was not conveyed within the one-year period, and the seller sued the buyer for breach of contract and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>fraud, arguing that the buyer had prevented the resale of the property to foreclose her right to one-half of the proceeds.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">{\u00b6 17} The court held that the parol evidence rule did not bar the fraud claim. In so holding, the court emphasized that the seller\u2019s claims \u201cdo not seek to contradict or vary the terms of the written agreement. In fact, they do not rest on any prior agreements or promises at all. * * * To the contrary, [the seller\u2019s] claims fully admit, and indeed rely upon, the fact that [the buyer\u2019s] promise to split the excess proceeds is, as stated in the written agreement, entirely conditional upon the sale of the property to Developers within one year.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The court stated that the proffered parol, evidence was offered to show that the buyer \u201cintended from the outset to prevent the fulfillment of the condition that would invoke his contractual promise to share the excess proceeds\u201d and that the evidence was therefore not barred by the parol evidence rule.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">{\u00b6 18} The essence of the fraud in <em>Galmish, </em>then, was that the defendant did not intend to fulfill, at the time the contract was executed, the express contractual condition that induced the plaintiff to enter into the agreement.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Thus, the policy underlying the parol evidence rule, namely protecting the integrity of the written contract, was not implicated in Galmish,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">{\u00b6 19} The case at bar is distinguishable from Galmish. The representations or promises alleged to have been made by Squire were not evidenced in the written agreement. Although the APA and the related documents explicitly addressed the liens on the radio station, they did not contain Squire\u2019s alleged misrepresentations concerning Stop 26\u2019s financial ability to satisfy the indebtedness or the creditors\u2019 willingness to accept lesser amounts to release the liens. Citicasters\u2019 claims, then, did seek to contradict or vary the terms of the written agreements and thus ran afoul of the parol evidence rule. We therefore reject Citicasters\u2019 argument that the case at bar is controlled by the holding in <em>Galmish.</em><footnotemark><em>25</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b745-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>{\u00b6 20} For the foregoing reasons, we hold that the parol evidence rule precluded recovery in the case at bar and that the trial court correctly granted the motion for judgment on the pleadings. The assignment of error is overruled, and the judgment of the court of common pleas is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b745-6\">Doan, P.J., and Gorman, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b740-9\">.
