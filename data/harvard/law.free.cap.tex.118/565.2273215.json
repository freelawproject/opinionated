If by any possibility, a devise violates the rule against perpetuity, it cannot stand. Biglow v. Cady, 171 Ill., 229, 63 A. L. R., 230, quoted in Anderson v. Menefee, 174 S. W., 907.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b588-8\">If there is a possibility that a violation of this rule can happen, then the devise must be held void. Waldo v. Cummings, 45 Ill., 421; Post v. Rohrback, 142 Ill., 600; Deford v. Deford, 36 Md., 176; Sears v. Putnam, 102 Mass., 6; Gray, Perps., Secs. 204, 369, 374, quoted in Anderson v. Menefee, 174 S. W., 908; Gray\u2019s Rule Against Perpetuities, 2nd ed., Sec. 201, p. 166; 30 Cyc., 1485. The rule deals with the vesting of the title. Anderson v. Menefee, 174 S. W., 908.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b588-9\">The will definitely violates the law against perpetuities. The specific bequests to Babette Moore, great-granddaughter, are, one of them, dependent upon her reaching the age of sixteen, another upon her reaching the age of seventeen, and another upon her reaching the age of eighteen. \u201cIn the event,\u201d says the will, \u201cBabatte should die before coming into possession of any of the things given her by this will * * * the remaining things herein willed Babette shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>be given by my executor to my oldest living great-granddaughter, if I should then have one, but if I should at that time not have a living great-granddaughter, then all of my said things * * * shall become a part of my general property and pass under the other provisions of the will.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b589-6\">In the instant case, the will provides for payment of each bequest after the next preceding bequest. Manifestly the payments for a number of named lives must be made before other bequests can vest. But these named lives are not, under the will, indicated as parts of the period within which vestiture must take place, and therefore the limit of time within which the property may be kept out of commerce is not a life or lives in being and twenty-one years, but twenty-one years only. Johnson v. Preston, 226 Ill., 447, 10 L. R. A. (N. S.) 564.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b589-7\">Title to the valuable properties named in this paragraph of the will is in abeyance until Babette reaches the age of seventeen as to some of the property and eighteen as to some; title then is dependent upon the existence at that time of a person or class of persons in one of whom title may vest. If title does not then vest in such person, it goes back into the estate and is subject to all the other contingencies which will hereafter be discussed. In any event the vestiture is made dependent upon two conditions, impossible now of determination, upon two future contingencies either or both of which may or may not be. It will be noted that the great-granddaughter in whom the property might in the future vest was not someone in being (or not necessarily same one in being) at the time of the testatrix\u2019s death, but someone who might be in being at the time of the death of Babette Moore before reaching the age of seventeen and eighteen. There is no dissent among the authorities as to the invalidity of this provision of the will. Anderson v. Menefee, 174 S. W., 905.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b589-8\">In Neely v. Brogdon, 214 S. W., 614, it is declared that a void will is no will. In the Constitution it is declared that \u201cperpetuities * * * shall not be allowed.\u201d A will creating a perpetuity is no will. A court may probate wills only \u2014 not illegal void instruments not wills. A court cannot \u201callow\u201d a perpetuity. However irregularly the question may come before it, a court cannot render a judgment that would have this forbidden effect. No rule of procedure could be adopted by the Legislature that would compel a court to allow a perpetuity. Texas &amp; Pacific Coal Co. v. Lawson, 34 S. W., 720; Purdue v. Purdue, 208 S. W., 355; Brauer v. Brauer, L. R. A., 1918A, 445.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b590-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>The legal right of appellant, to contest and oppose the probate of the instrument offered, as a will, is shown by her pleadings filed for that purpose. City of Dallas v. Shows, 212 S.

Moore, Guardian of Brownie Babette Moore, a minor, gave notice of appeal to the District Court of Orange County, Texas, but did not perfect his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-10\">\u201cSubsequently, on the 9th day of February, 1925, R. A. Moore, Guardian, filed his petition for certiorari in the District Court of Orange County, to review the judgment entered by the County Court, for the particular errors complained of in the said petition for certiorari, which were claimed to be:</p>\n<p id=\"b598-11\">\u201c(1) That the said'R. A. Moore, Guardian, was denied the right to offer evidence, or examine or cross-examine witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-12\">\u201c(2) That the Probate Court was without jurisdiction, because the application for probate did not allege that the testatrix was over twenty-one years old, and did not allege that she was of sound mind and disposing memory, and did not allege that the will was made under circumstances required by law; and</p>\n<p id=\"b598-13\">\u201c(3) That proper notice of time and place of probating the will was not given according to law; and</p>\n<p id=\"b598-14\">\u201c(4) That the proceedings were void and irregular and in violation of the laws of Texas and the Constitution of the United States; and</p>\n<p id=\"b598-15\">\u201c(5) The application for probate was fatally defective and did not state a cause of action; and</p>\n<p id=\"b598-16\">\u201c(6) That the court erred in sustaining the exceptions of the proponent of the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-17\">\u201cThe petition for certiorari alleged that H. J. L. Stark, independent executor, was the only person adversely interested, and he was duly cited to appear and answer the proceedings in certiorari in the District Court of Orange County, Texas.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-18\">\u201cH. J. L. Stark, independent executor, filed in the District Court of Orange County, Texas, his answer to the petition for certiorari, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>excepting a limine to the further prosecution of the proceedings in certiorari, unless and until the said R. A. Moore, Guardian of Brownie Babette Moore, a minor, should first show an interest in the estate of the decedent, demand for proof of which was specially made, and otherwise made due answer to the petition for certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">\u201cThe certiorari proceedings were heard on November 22, 1925, and the District Court sustained the exception of the Independent Executor to the petition for certiorari of R. A. Moore, Guardian, upon his failure to establish by proof, or submit any proof of an interest of the contestant in the estate of the decedent, and in connection with said exception the Independent Executor submitted evidence establishing a lack of interest on the part of the contestant in the estate of the decedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">\u201cThe District Court then proceeded, upon the evidence submitted in said court, to approve and confirm the judgment entered in the County Court of Orange County on January 12, 1925, and certified its said judgment to the County Court of Orange County, Texas, for observance.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">\u201cIn compliance with the demand of the contestant, the District Court filed its findings of fact and conclusions of law, which said findings of fact are not attacked or sought to be reviewed in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-8\">\u201cR. A. Moore, Guardian, excepted to the judgment entered by the District Court of Orange County, Texas, and gave notice of appeal, and thereafter duly perfected his appeal to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-9\">\u201cOn the day that this cause was set for submission and oral argument in this court, the appellant filed in this court a written suggestion urging that this court declare and hold that the will admitted to probate be declared void because it was and is in violation of the rule against perpetuities, and requested leave of this court to file a supplemental brief in support of this contention. This attack on the will was suggested and made for the first time by appellant when the case was called for submission, and is here presented by appellant as fundamental error.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-10\">\u201c1. Does the will of Mrs. Frances A. Lutcher, admitted to probate by the County Court of Orange County, violate the rule against perpetuities?</p>\n<p id=\"b599-11\">.\u201c2. If the will does violate the rule against perpetuities, is appellant entitled to contest the probate of the will, as attempted by him, without a showing of an interest in himself or his ward in the estate of the testatrix, Mrs. Frances A. Lutcher?</p>\n<p id=\"b600-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number><em>\u201c3. </em>If the will is not void because violative of the rule against perpetuities, was appellant entitled to contest the probate of the will in this proceeding, as he attempted to do, in the absence of proof of an interest in himself or his ward in the estate of the testatrix, Mrs. Frances A. Lutcher?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b600-3\">We will not consider the questions in the order in which they were presented, for our views upon one question make it unnecessary to decide the others.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">Article 3315 of our Statute concerning Estates of Decedents provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">\u201cAny person interested in an estate may, at any time before any character of proceeding is decided upon by the court, file opposition thereto in writing, and shall be entitled to process for witnesses and evidence, and to be heard upon such opposition as in other suits.\u201d This is but a concrete statement of the universal rule of parties that no person will be permitted to maintain a proceeding without showing an interest in the subject-matter thereof. It is contrary to the policy of the State to permit the machinery of its courts to be set in motion at the instance of one who can in no event be profited thereby. Courts do not sit to decide mere abstract questions of law but to redress grievances and prevent wrongs. Whatever the jurisdiction of a court, that court has no power to exercise such jurisdiction until its power is invoked by one having an interest in the subject matter. But we need not deal in generalities for the precise question has been decided in this State.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">.In Abrams, et al. v. Ross\u2019 Estate, et al., 250 S. W., 1019, the Commission of Appeals, through Presiding Judge Gallagher, said: \u201cObviously the burden is upon every person appearing to oppose the probate of a will to allege, and, if required, to prove, that he has some interest in the estate of the testator which will be affected by such will if admitted to probate. In the absence of such interest a contestant is a mere meddlesome intruder.\u201d The Supreme Court, upon the recommendation of the Commission of Appeals, ordered that the District Court, upon another trial would be governed by the opinion of the Commission of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">In Dickson v. Dickson, 5 S. W. (2d) 744, Presiding Judge Short, for the Commission of Appeals, cited, with approval, the Abrams v. Ross case and other cases holding that such interest entitling one to contest the probate of a will means that such person would but for the will have an interest in the estate. This evidently is the common sense meaning of this statute. The interest to be protected is the right that would otherwise be jeopardized. One who confessedly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>would receive no benefit from the court\u2019s decision can not invoke its judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-3\">Here the certificate shows that appellant\u2019s wards have no interest in the estate of Mrs. Frances A. Lutcher. They would not take in any manner any part of the estate if the will should be denied probate. To insist upon a hearing, under such circumstances, is to trifle with the courts. Upon such a contest the court could redress no injury, nor could it protect any right.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\">If the appellant, for want of an interest in the estate, cannot contest the probate of the will it, of course, can make no difference what the ground of such contest may be. Conceding that the will was, in truth, void as creating a perpetuity, its invalidity would be no greater than if it were a forgery, obtained by fraud or duress, or executed by one lacking in testamentary capacity. Under any of these circumstances the will would be subject to contest by any interested person, but in none of them could a stranger invoke the powers of the court upon a contest.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">So that, we answer questions 2 and 3 that whatever the invalidity of the will may be, the appellant is not entitled to contest its probate because his wards are shown to have no interest in the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">This renders it entirely unnecessary, if not improper, to answer the first question propounded as to whether the will involved violates the rule against perpetuities.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">Opinion of the Commission of Appeals answering certified questions adopted and ordered certified to the Court of Civil Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-8\"><em>C. M. </em>Cureton, Chief Justice.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b601-9\">on appellant\u2019s motion for rehearing.</p>\n<author id=\"b601-10\">Mr. Judge Speer</author>\n<p id=\"Aqj\">delivered the opinion of the Commission of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-11\">Appellant complains that we should have answered the question involving the validity of the will without any determination of the one involving the capacity of the appellant, or at least that \"the right or failure of the right of the appellant to contest cannot be an issue until the central question is determined.\u201d Throughout the able argument filed in support of the motion the point is stressed that since the Constitution forbids the creation of a perpetuity, the matter is of such a nature that it should be determined as going to the very right of the trial court, or any court as to that, to order the will to be probated. Counsel argues that the Constitution being thus emphatic, and the vice, if any appearing upon the very face of the will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>tendered for probate, the primary consideration for the court is the validity of the instrument. But this reasoning is specious. It is true the Constitution does prohibit the creation of a perpetuity. It is likewise true if the will in controversy is subject to that criticism the vice appears upon the face of the instrument offered for probate. It is also true that if the instrument is void as being in contravention of the Constitution, it should not have been probated by the trial court. For it was, as argued by counsel for the motion, the duty of that court to probate only a valid will; but all these considerations are beside the one controlling question which we decided on the original hearing. They may all be, as they should be, conceded. But where, as here, an instrument has been probated as a last will and one seeks to reverse that judgment upon appeal from a contest, the burden is upon him primarily to show that he is an interested party; in other words, that he is aggrieved or his legal rights have, in some way, been affected adversely by the decision. This is the doorway to any consideration of the merits. It is. not enough that he shows an error has been committed but he must further show that it was of such a nature as was calculated to injure him. And this rule applies equally to those cases, such as this, where the supposed error consists of a violation of a constitutional provision. It is not a question of the enormity of the error but of the right of the complainant to attack it. It is akin to, if not identical with, the well-established rule that one who assails a law as unconstitutional must come showing that the feature of the act complained of operates to deprive him of some constitutional right. Aikins v. Kingsbury, 247 U. S., 484, 62 L. Ed., 1226, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-3\">The argument is further made that if the will is void because of the perpetuity alleged, its attempted probate imparts no validity thereto and it is of no force whatever and may be attacked directly or collaterally by anyone at any time in any tribunal. All this is abstractly true but it is equally true that such one must, in order to sustain the attack, be interested in the matter to be determined. This means more than a mere popular interest. It means a legal interest in the subject-matter, \u2014 one cognizable by the courts. It is sufficient for the ends of justice, \u2014 and that is the purpose of law,\u2014 that anyone interested may raise the question of the validity of the will if he timely objects. If, as contended, the will creates a perpetuity and the attempted probate thereof is void, then anyone interested in the matter could assail the instrument whenever and wherever adverse rights were attempted to be asserted under it. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>But this in nowise argues against what we have held, that the appellant cannot, at any time or anywhere, attack the probate of the will in the absence of a showing of interest in the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">We therefore recommend that the motion for rehearing be overruled.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
