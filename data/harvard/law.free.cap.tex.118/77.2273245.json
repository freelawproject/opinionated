Edgar Thompson at Plemons, Texas;</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">\u201cThat said two sections, Nos. 12 and 10 were forfeited for the nonpayment of interest on September 22, 1925, by the following entry made on the file wrapper, \u2018Land Forfeited, September 22, 1925, J. H. Walker, Acting Commissioner,\u2019 and a similar entry of this fact of forfeiture was made on the accounts kept with each of said sections and notice of the forfeiture of each section was mailed to the County Clerk of Hutchinson County, Texas, at the close of office hours on September 24, 1925;</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">\u201cThat Permit No. 10352 to prospect said Section 12 for oil and gas was issued on February 5, 1926 to Wm.

Edgar Thompson by his attorneys, Eckhardt and Turpin and that the amount of money re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>quired to pay -the accrued interest to reinstate was tendered and the money returned for the reason the areas were covered by the aforesaid permits.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">\u201cIn Testimony Whereof I hereunto set my hand and affix the seal of said office the date first above written.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">(signed) \u201cJ. T. Robison,</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">Commissioner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">The relator in his petition for mandamus prayed judgment of this court compelling and requiring the Commisioner of the General Land Office to cancel the mineral permit issued to William Blakeslee, and to either rescind the forfeiture endorsement on the wrapper pertaining to this land, or to re-instate said land, upon relator paying all past due interest, fees, and penalties.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-9\">The original petition for mandamus was filed in this court by the relator on April 6, 1927, and on February 29, 1928, the relator filed in this court a motion to dismiss his petition for mandamus against the respondent and all co-respondents, and if necessary, to withdraw this cause from submission in Section \u201cA\u201d of the Commission of Appeals in order that dismissal may be entered, and that such action be without prejudice to the right of relator R. Edgar Thompson, to bring and prosecute any suit, action or legal proceedings of any kind or nature that he may deem proper in the future, although the same subject-matter be at issue and among the same or any number of the same parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-10\">The respondent, the Land Commissioner, and the co-respondent, Blakeslee, the holder of the oil permit, contest the motion to dismiss, and, in our opinion, set up good and sufficient reasons why it would be unjust and inequitable to dismiss this application at this late date, and especially would such action be unjust and inequitable to the said Blakeslee, holder of the mineral permit, as rights under said permit have been called in question, and rendered uncertain by the filing of this application for mandamus, and by the action of this court in permitting the filing of same.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-11\">We are further of the opinion that the interests of the State, and the co-respondent, demand that said motion be refused, and that it is within the power of this court to refuse a motion to dismiss an \u2022original mandamus, and that such power ought to be exercised where justice demands it.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-12\">All legal questions involved in the original mandamus proceedings have been fully discussed and decided in Cause No. 4825, S. H. Huggins v. J. T. Robison, Commissioner, et al., except that this case' involves the forfeiture of Section 10, Block M \u2014 23, Certificate 1027, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>T. C. R. R. Co., containing 640 acres of land in Hutchinson County, Texas, and this case is ruled by the decision in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-3\">It also appears on the face of the record that the mineral permit issued to Wm. Blakeslee on February 5, 1926, has expired by operation of law under similar circumstances as set out in Cause No. 4825 above referred to.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">We therefore recommend that the motion to dismiss the application for mandamus filed herein by relator be overruled, that the mandamus prayed for by relator be in all things refused and that the mineral permit issued to Wm. Blakeslee be adjudged to be in force for the length of time after final judgment herein that it would have been in force after the date relator was permitted to file application for mandamus, had said permission for application to file mandamus not been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">Opinion of the Commission of Appeals is adopted and mandamus refused and mineral permit adjudged extended as recommended by the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\"><em>C. M. Cureton, </em>Chief Justice.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
