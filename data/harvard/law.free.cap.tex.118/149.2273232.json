Upon appeal the Court of Civil Appeals, Ninth District, found lack of evidence to show a contract such as that first averred by defendants (appellees here) and presence of evidence to raise an issue about the contract (breach and damages) alternatively pleaded, and reversed the judgment of the trial court and remanded the cause \u201cwith instructions to render judgment in favor of plaintiffs\u201d (appellants here) \u201cfor the amount of their account, deducting therefrom such damages, if any, suffered by\u201d defendants (appellees here) \u201cunder the second count in their cross-action.\u201d 254 S. W., 1027.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-11\">Upon re-trial an issue, concerning amount of damages, \u201cif any,\u201d defendants suffered account of dishonor of \u201cOrder No. 540\u201d (see 294 S. W., 964) was submitted to the jury and in response \u201cthe jury found there were no damages.\u201d Judgment for plaintiffs (appellants here) for amount sued for, with interest, and against defendants (appellees here) on all issues followed. Appeal resulted in affirmance of that part of the judgment which allowed plaintiffs recovery, reversal of \u201cthat part of the judgment decreeing that\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>defendants \u201ctake nothing by their cross-action and counterclaim\u201d and remand of the cause for \u201ca retrial\u201d for the purpose only of determining what sum, \u201cif any,\u201d defendants \u201care entitled to recover under their cross-action.\u201d 294 S. W., 963, 967.</p>\n<p id=\"AP7\">Mandate having issued from the Court of Civil Appeals pursuant to action just mentioned and having been filed below, plaintiffs (appellants here) sought issuance of execution. Thereupon defendants (appellees here) sought and obtained an order restraining the district clerk from issuing execution, and staying all proceedings to enforce the judgment until final disposition of the cross-action. Plaintiffs (appellants here) duly moved vacation' of that order; their motion was denied and they appealed. Thereupon the Court of Civil Appeals reversed the order of the District Court and entered one \u201cdissolving the injunction.\u201d The cause is now pending upon motion oE appellees for rehearing and the Court of Civil Appeals has certified this question.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">\u201cIs Appellant Nalle entitled to the issuance of the execution demanded by him for the enforcement of the judgment rendered in his favor by the trial court and affirmed by this court prior to the final disposition of the cross-action of appellees?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">OPINION.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">The relief sought by defendants on their \u201ccross-action\u201d (so-called) ' in one phase is: (a) Adjudication of their right to damages and the amount of such damages; (b) deduction from the damages thus established of the amount adjudicated to plaintiffs and judgment for the balance. In the other phase they seek: (c) Adjudication of their right to damages and the amount of such damages; (d) \u201coff-set\u201d as between the amount thus established and the amount \u201cawarded to the plaintiffs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b174-8\">\u201cThe great object of all discounts or set-offs is to adjust the indebtedness between the parties and permit executory process to be enforced only for the balance that may be due.\u201d Simpson v. Huston, 14 Texas, 476, 481. Set-off \u201cis the doctrine of bringing into the presence of each other the obligations of A to B and of B to A, and by the judicial action of the court making each obligation extinguish the other.\u201d 24 R. C. L., 796; Blount v. Windley, 95 U. S., 173, 24 L. Ed., 424.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-9\">In virtue of statutory provisions (Arts. 2014, 2015, 2017, R. S., 1925) a defendant may avail himself of that juxtaposition and pro tanto mutual cancellation of liabilities by way of defense (Id.) as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>well as assert claim for judgment for whatever balance in his favor there may be (Art. 2215, R. S., 1925).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">Averments of the bases of those rights and claims thereof make up a part of the \u201cpleadings\u201d to which the \u201cone final judgment\u201d must be \u201cconformed\u201d in obedience to requirement of Art. 2211, R. S., 1925. Hence, it has been held, a judgment not disposing of a reconvention is not a final one. American Road Mach. Co. v. City of Crockett, Texas Civ. App., 49 S. W., 251; Lanius v. People\u2019s Home Tel. Co., Texas Civ. App., 160 S. W., 304; Brown v. Wofford, Texas Civ. App., 167 S. W., 764; Anderson, etc. v. Smith, Texas Civ. App., 167 S. W., 765.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">The case made on the pleading, then, involves : (a) ascertainment of plaintiffs\u2019 right and amount due thereon; (b) ascertainment of defendants\u2019 right and amount due thereby; (c) judicial deduction of the smaller from the larger amount and award of recovery (to the party entitled) of the balance. Simpson v. Huston, supra; Hegman v. Roberts, Texas Civ. App., 201 S. W., 268; Blount v. Windley, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">In consequence, the judgment in favor of Nalle, even though affirmed, is interlocutory, and judgment in the case cannot become final until defendants\u2019 claims are finally adjudicated or given disposition otherwise. The necessary result of holding that the elements of the case are severable SO' as to permit a judgment presently en-forcible in one branch is to deny the right of mutual cancellation by judicial action which, we say, is established in our law.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">Accordingly we recommend that the question certified be answered \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b175-9\">The opinion of the Commission of Appeals answering the certified question is adopted and ordered certified.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-10\"><em>C. M. Cure ton, </em>Chief Justice.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
