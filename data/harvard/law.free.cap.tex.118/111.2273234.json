D., 1926.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b140-3\">According to the certificate</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">\u201cThe following special exceptions to plaintiff\u2019s petition were by the court sustained, to-wit:</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">\u201cNo. 2. That the contract relied on came within the inhibition \u25a0 of subdivision 4 of article 3995, Rev. Civ. Statutes of 1925, in that neither the contract relied on nor the exhibits attached thereto showed the terms of the lease to be executed.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">\u201cNo. 3. That the contract as alleged was too indefinite and uncertain as to the terms of the lease to be enforceable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">Plaintiffs \u201crefused to amend their petition and thereupon the court dismissed said suit\u201d at plaintiffs\u2019 cost.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">Batten and Hatfield duly excepted, gave notice and perfected their appeal and the cause is now pending in the Court of Civil Appeals, Second District.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-9\">In the certificate it is said:</p>\n<p id=\"b140-10\">\u201cWhether or not the contract which was executed when read in connection with the unfilled blank form of the lease attached thereto was too indefinite and uncertain to create a binding obligation on the part of defendant to execute any character of lease as contended in some of the special exceptions, is a question upon which we have serious doubt, and as we are not entirely agreed, we deem it advisable to certify to your Honorable Court for determination the following questions:</p>\n<p id=\"b140-11\">\u201c1. Was the contract too indefinite to serve as a basis for plaintiff\u2019s suit in either of the following particulars :</p>\n<p id=\"b140-12\">\u201c(a) The absence in the contract of any term of years to be inserted in the blank in that portion of the form, of the lease quoted above as the term for which the lease was to continue.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-13\">\u201c(b) The failure of the contract to provide how the 10,000 acres to be held by the syndicate by the payment of one-eighth royalty of oil in consideration of the drilling of the first well should be determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-14\">\u201c(c) The absence of any provision in the contract as to how the remaining 10,000 acres upon which acreage rentals were to be paid should be determined in the event the completion of the first well should be delayed longer than the period of one year after the date of the execution of the lease, even though the drilling thereof should be prosecuted with due diligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-15\">\u201c2. Did the court err in sustaining special exceptions Nos. 2 and 3, noted above, to plaintiff\u2019s petition?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>OPINION.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">1. The \u201ccontract\u201d declared upon is not a \u201ccomprehensive transaction\u201d of which a part only was reduced to writing comparable to either of those involved in Thomas v. Hammond, 47 Texas, 42, 52, or Gulf C. &amp; S. F. Ry. Co. v. Jones, 82 Texas, 156, 17 S. W., 534. , The writing itself is averred to be the \u201ccontract\u201d, \u2014 and this means, of course, that whatever things had been finally agreed upon were merged, for evidence, in the paper. Hence, pre-existent agreement upon various terms mutually intended to be omitted from the writing then presently signed but to be included in the \u201clease\u201d as yet to be executed, with predicate for an exception to the parol evidence rule (Thomas v. Hammond and Gulf C. &amp; S. F. Ry. Co. v. Jones), is negatived, \u2014 as is predicate for exceptions resting in fraud or mistake.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">The \u201ccontract in writing\u201d is pleaded in <em>haec verba </em>and without qualifying or explanatory averments. So presented, the \u201cwriting\u201d imports, prima facie, lack of agreement in respect to various terms to be stated in the \u201clease\u201d if, as and when executed and pretermission of agreement thereon. Thus, there is introduced the anomaly of an agreement to make an agreement of an undisclosed nature in the future. See, Joseph v. Bostick, Texas Com. App., 276 S. W., 672, and cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">2. But if the matters particularly mentioned by the Court of Civil Appeals be treated as involving mere ambiguities, there yet remains the fact of lack of averments putting a definite construction on those portions of the \u201ccontract\u201d or on the \u201ccontract\u201d as a whole. Ingram v. Winters, Texas Civ. App., 102 S. W., 432, 435; Greene Gold-Silver Co. v. Silbert, Texas, Civ. App., 158 S. W., 803; Durkee v. Cota, 74 Cal., 316, 16 Pac., 5; Johnson v. Kindred St. Bank, 12 N. D., 336, 96 N. W., 588; 4 Ency. PL &amp; Pr., 918.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">3. In our opinion the exception called \u201cNo. 3\u201d was properly sustained. If that be true, declination of plaintiffs to amend renders immaterial the other questions propounded.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-9\">We recommend that such portion of Question No. 2, certified, as relates to Exception No. 3 be answered \u201cNo\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-10\">The opinion of the Commission of Appeals answering certified questions is adopted and ordered certified.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-11\"><em>C. M. </em>Cureton, Chief Justice.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
