Smyth, Special Commissioner of the State of Coahuila and Texas, appointed under the 32nd Article of the Law of 26th of March, 1834, granting land and providing for issuing titles to the inhabitants of the frontier of Nacogdoches and those residing east of Austin\u2019s Colonies.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>The petition alleges, that the land lay within the twenty leagues bordering on the United States, and that Wilson Ewing resided within the said border leagues, on the frontier of Nacogdoches, at the date of the law of 1834, and at the date of the grant to him, and continued to reside there until long after the year 1841, and that the Commissioner, George W. Smyth, had full power and authority to issue the grant in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">To this suit the defendant excepted : \u201c 1st. That the land \u201c described in said petition, is situated within the twenty fron\u201ctier leagues bordering on the United States of the North, \u201c and not subject to be located, surveyed and granted on the \u201c 29th day of October, 1835, without the assent of the Executive \u201c of the National Government of Mexico ; and 2nd. It is not \u201c averred in said petition that the assent of the National Gov- \u201c ernment was obtained by Wilson Ewing, or any other person \u201c for him, to the location, survey and grant of said land.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">These exceptions were sustained by the Court below ; and it ordered that the plaintiff take nothing by his suit; on which he has appealed to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">It is well settled, as a general rule, that the assent of the Executive of the Mexican Confederacy was necessary to the validity of grants of land, like the one in question, lying in the border leagues. And it is also the well settled general rule, that this assent must be averred in the petition, and cannot be proven unless so averred. (See Goode v. McQueen\u2019s Heirs and The Republic v. Thorn, 3 Tex. R. p. 241, 499.) .But whether in suits like the present, admitting the necessity of the assent of the Federal Executive, it was necessary to aver more than is averred in the petition, that the Commissioner had full power and authority to make the grant, is, under the latter authority, not so certain. It is there said (page 510) that, \u201c in suits of this character, that is between individuals on \u201c claims by purchase, if there be only the general allegation \u201c that the title emanated from the proper authorities of the \u201c State, this would be sufficient to support the action, and au- <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>\u201c thorise the admission of evidence to show the title had been \u201c issued with the previous assent of the federal authority.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">However, as this case has been argued on the grounds of the necessity of the assent of the Federal Executive of Mexico to titles under the 32nd Article of the Law of Coahuila and Texas of the 26th of March, 1834, and how far, as known to the Court, from law and history, this assent was given ; and what are the meaning and extent of this Article of the Law ; and this case has been brought before us for our decision on these points, we will meet the questions presented to us.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">As has been said, it is the well settled general rule, that the assent of the Federal Executive of Mexico was necessary to the validity of grants of land lying in the twenty leagues bordering on the United States of the North. On the revolution of Mexico, by which she established her independence of Spain, all the ungranted or public land within the established limits of Mexico became the public property of the newly born State. Subsequently the Mexican nation resolved to divide themselves into several sovereign States, to be united together in a confederacy ; and the Constituent Congress of Mexico passed an Act to this effect on the 19th of November, 1823 ; but the Act was not published and did not go into effect until the 4th of October, 1824. In the meantime, between the passage and the publication of this Act, the Government of Mexico, on the 18th of August, 1824, passed a general law for the colonization of the public lands lying within the limits of the contemplated States ; and by virtue and operation of this law, the public lands lying within the said States became severally and respectively the property of the States in which they lay.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">But this gift of the public lands was coupled with certain limitations and restrictions, among which was the provision of the 4th Article of the Law of the 18th of August, that \u201c the \u201c territories comprehended within twenty leagues of the limits \u201c of any foreign nation, or the ten coast leagues, shall not be \u201c colonized without the previous approbation of the general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>\u201c Supreme Executive power.\u201d This restriction to the gift of the public lands, the State of Coahuila and Texas, on accepting the gift, assented to, and until a late date, if not always, respected and observed. Thus in the preamble of their first Act on the subject of colonization, Decree No. 16, passed on the 24th March, 1825, the Congress of Coahuila and Texas profess to act \u201c in conformity to \u201d \u201c the basis established by Decree No. 72 of the general Congress,\u201d the law of the 18th of August, 1824. And the 7th Article of the Decree No. 16, enjoins on the Executive of the State, in granting lands, the observance of the restriction of the Decree No. 72. And the instructions of the Executive of the State, settled on the 4th of September, 1827, for the government of Commissioners for the distribution of lands to new colonists, who should present themselves to settle in the State according to the Colonization Law of March 24th, 1825, contain the same injunction. And when, on the 28th of April, 1832, the Congress of Coahuila and Texas, by Decree No. 190, repealed the law of the 24th of March, 1825, and substituted a new law in its place, they still observed and enjoined this restriction. But in a little more than two years after this Decree, to wit, on the 24th \u25a0of March, 1834, the Congress of the State of Coahuila and Texas, by Decree No. 272, repealed the Decree No. 190, and likewise all instructions to Commissioners opposed to the provisions of this repealing Act; and while providing for a new mode of disposing of all the public lands, to wit, by public auction, they make no mention of the requisite of the previous assent of the general Supreme Executive power to the sale of lands, under the general provisions of the law, lying within the border and coast leagues. But whether it meant, in such sales, to disregard the restriction on these leagues contained in the national Colonization Law, we do not mean to say ; nor is it important, for according to our belief no sales were ever made under the general provisions of the law ; these provisions having soon after its passage, to wit, on the 2nd of May in the same year,. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>by decree No. 287 of the Congress of Coahuila and Texas been suspended, and never afterwards put in force. But there is a special provision in the law of 1834, which was never suspended or repealed, but which was carried into operation, and under which a great many titles.were issued. This provision is contained in the 32nd Article of the Law, and is as follows : \u201c To the inhabitants of the frontier of Nacogdoches, and those \u201c residing east of Austin\u2019s Colonies, titles shall be issued to the \u201c lands they may occupy, according to the 16th Article of the \u201c Colonization Law of the 26th of March, 1824, and the reso- \u201c lutions of the General Government of April and August, 1828 ; \u201c and the Executive shall appoint one or two Commission- \u201c ers for that object, who, without any delay, shall execute the \u201c same at the expense of the persons interested ; and the titles \u201c heretofore legally issued are hereby confirmed.\u201d This translation of the 32nd Article is taken from the very able \u201c statement of the Commissioner of the Gen. Land Office,\u201d written by the Hon. George W. Smyth, (which statement we have read with much instruction,) and differs from the translation in the printed copy of the laws of Coahuila and Texas in this, the latter employs the term \u201c occupy \u201d instead of \u201c may occupy,\u201d as employed in the above translation. On this point the author of the statement says (page 44\u2014-5) \u201c I am conscious that \u201c this translation is different from the published decrees, \u2022 but \u201c that the translation of this expression, in that collection, is \u201c erroneous, needs but a slight examination to determine. If \u201c the translation,\u2018 they occupy,\u2019 were correct, the corespondent \u201c verb in the Spanish, should be ocupan, in the indicative \u201cmood; but the verb used in this article is \u2018ocupen\u2019\u2014\u2018they \u201c1 may occupy,\u2019 in the subjunctive mood.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">This article evidently embraced lands lying within the border leagues ; and it is equally evident that no further assent of the general Supreme Executive Power, was made necessary to the grants under this Article, than what was understood to have been already given ; at least this was the obvious mean-. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>ing of the Article, and the one which was attached to it by the officers intrusted with its execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">As to the validity of this Article of the law, supposing that no assent of the general Supreme Executive Power had been given to its provision, and that there is any conflict with \u201c the \u201c constitutive Act, the Constitution of the Republic, and the <em>\u201c </em>basis established by Decree No. 72, of the General Con- \u201c gress,\u201d we say, that this neither is any longer an open question, more than the general rule that the previous assent of the General Supreme Executive Power was necessary to the grant of lands lying within the border and coast leagues. For in view of this Article of the Law of 1834, it is said in Goode v. McQueen\u2019s Heirs, 3d Tex. R. p. 256, \u201c had the Congress of \u201c the State passed a law for the settlement of this land on the \u201c border, and authorized its Executive to have granted the <em>\u201c </em>same to new settlers, it might have been well questioned <em>\u201c </em>whether the judicial tribunals of the State could have adjudi- \u201c cated such Act to be unconstitutional and void, on the ground \u201c of its repugnancy to the Federal Constitution; it would have \u201c presented a case of conflict between the political authority of \u201c the State and Federal Governments ; and it might have been \u201c insisted that it should have been settled between them, and \u201c was beyond the control of the judicial tribunals to say that <em>\u201c </em>the State Legislature had transcended its powers. The \u201c question may seem strange and preposterous to those who \u201c have been accustomed to see the uniform and harmonious ac- \u201c tion of the different departments of the Government under <em>\u201c </em>the Constitution of the United States and the several States ,l composing the Union ; and the proposition that the judiciary \u201c had not the authority to declare an Act of the legislature <em>\u201c </em>void for its repugnancy to the Constitution, would seem to \u201c involve a most manifest absurdity. It will however be borne \u201c in mind, that in all popular governments, the Constitution \u201c embodies the will of the people, and their will is spoken \u201c through that instrument; and if the people have thought it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>' inexpedient to repose such power in the judicial department, \u201c but to deposite it elsewhere, their will cannot be gainsaid. \u201c Both the Constitution of the Republic, and of the State of <em>\u201c </em>Coahuila and Texas seem to have reserved this power to the <em>41 </em>legislative department. Article 165 of the Federal Consti- \u201c tution is as follows, viz : 1 Congress alone has the right to <em>\u201c </em>interpret the Constitution in doubtful cases.\u2019 In the 9th \u201c Article of the State Constitution, in the enumeration of the \u25a0\u201c powers of Congress, will be found the following : 1 To enact, \u201c1 <em>interpret, </em>amend, or repeal the laws relative to the adminis\u201c1 tration and internal government of the State, in all its \u201c 1 branches;\u2019 and in the Article 172, it is directed that1 the \u201c \u2018 tribunals and courts of justice, being authorised solely for \u201c 1 applying the law, <em>shall never interpret the same, </em>nor suspend \u201c \u2018 their execution.\u2019 These extracts would seem to be conclu- \u201c sive, whenever the power of the legislature to pass the Act \u201c was the question.\u201d And again, the same decision adds, (page 258,) \u201c If, then, there had been an Act of the State Legislature, \u201c that gave a right of property to the grantee, without refer-<em>41 </em>ence to the approbation of the Federal Executive, it forming <em>\u201c </em>a rule of property, I would not feel myself authorised to say <em>\u201c </em>that it was void, because repugnant to the general Coloniza- \u201c tion Law of the Republic. It not being repugnant to our Con- \u201c stitution of the Republic of Texas, nor inconsistent with our \u201c present institutions, I would not feel myself authorized to \u201c withhold the benefit of the Act of the Legislature of Coa- \u201c huila and Texas from the plaintiffs below, if it would sustain \u201c the grant under which they claim title, and the same has not \u201c been forfeited by abandonment, if the plaintiffs below showed <em>41 </em>that there was no impediment to their holding title so de- \u201c rived. There can be no doubt that the Acts of the Congress <em>4 \u2018 </em>of the State of Coahuila and Texas, so far as they are appli- \u201c cable to contracts executed and completed, and to rights con- \u201c summated, derived from the former government by those who <em>41 </em>were citizens of Texas at the date of the declaration of inde<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>11 pendence, must, in general, be regarded as the law of pro- <em>\u201c </em>perty ; and that any supposed repugnancy of the Acts of \u201c Congress to the State Constitution, or to the Constitution of \u201c the Republic of Mexico, cannot be considered; that they are \u201c still in force, unless they have been abrogated and annulled <em>\u201c </em>by the Constitution of the Republic of Texas, or are other- \u201c wise repugnant to and incompatible with the laws and insti- \u201c tutions of the new government. (See Section 1 of Schedule \u201c of Const, of the Republic.\u201d) <em>&gt;</em></p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">Section 1 of the Schedule of the Constitution of the Republic of Texas is as follows : \u201c That no inconvenience may arise \u201c from the adoption of this Constitution, it is declared by this \u201c Convention that all laws now in force in Texas, and not in- \u201c consistent with this Constitution, shall remain in full force \u201c until declared void, repealed, altered, or expire by their own \u201c limitation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">Again, in Egery <em>&amp; </em>Smith v. Power, decided at the Jan. Term of the Supreme Court in 1855, the Court say, \u201c The only recognized exception to this rule,\u201d (the necessity of the approbation of the Federal Executive, to locations within the border and littoral leagues,) \u201c is where a title in the reserved \u201c leagues has been issued under the specific authority of a de- \u201c cree of the Congress of the State of Coahuila and Texas. \u201c Such law having become a rule of property, and having been \u201c acquiesced in by the Congress of Mexico, (no act of that body \u201c having declared it null and void,) titles emanating under it \u201c must be respected by subsequent governments and authori- \u201c ties, and cannot be held null and void for the want of assent 11 by the Federal Executive. (Goode v. McQueen, 3 Tex. R. <em>\u201c </em>158.) This exception from the general rule has reference to \u201c titles issued under the Decree of the 26th of March, 1834.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">These two decisions settle the validity of the 32nd Article of the law of the 24th of March, 1834. But the interpretation and construction of this Article, its meaning and extent,\u2014these are questions which we are called upon at this time to decide. And here we acknowledge that we find some difficulty in mak<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>ing all its' parts agree ; but we have no doubt as to its meaning and effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">It is plain that the law was intended for the benefit of all those persons who are embraced in the plain meaning of the terms employed to describe them ; that is, to all the inhabitants of the frontier of Nacogdoches at the date of the law, and all those residing east of Austin\u2019s Colonies at the same date, who had not land granted to them according to the Colonization Laws, or who were not provided for by some colonization contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">It is equally clear that the extent of the grants to these persons is to be measured by the 16th Article of the Colonization Law- of 1825, to which reference is made for this purpose. That Article is as follows : \u201c Families and single men, who, \u201c having emigrated separately and at their own expense, shall \u201c wish to annex themselves to any of the new settlements, can \u201c do so at all times, and the <em>same, quantity of land shall be re- \u201c spectively assigned them as specified in the two foregoing ar- \u201c tides ; </em>but should they do so within the first six years from <em>\u201c </em>the establishment of the settlement, <em>one labor more shall be \u201c granted to families ; </em>and single men, instead of one-fourth, \u201c as specified in Article 15, shall receive one third.\u201d And the two preceding Articles, here referred to, are as follows : \u201c Ar- \u201c tide 14. One labor shall be granted to each family included \u201cin the contract, whose only occupation is the cultivation of \u201c the soil; and should the same also raise stock, grazing land \u201c shall be added to complete a sitio ; and should the raising of \u201c stock be the exclusive occupation, the family shall receive a \u201c superficies of twenty-four million square varas, (being a sitio \u201c lacking one labor.\u201d \u201cArticle 15. Unmarried men shall re- \u201c ceive the same quantity on marrying, and foreigners who \u201cmarry natives of the country, shall receive one-fourth <em>\u201c </em>more ; those who are entirely single, or who do not com- \u201c pose a part of any family, contenting themselves rather \u201c with the fourth part of the quantity aforesaid, which shall be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>\u201c computed to them on the assignment of their land.\u201d These references show an extension of grant of one league and one labor to families.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">But, then, this reference to \u201c the resolutions of the General Government of April and August, 1828,\u201d what does that mean? These resolutions were as follows, and addressed to the Secretary of the State of Coahuila and Texas : 1st. The resolution of April, 1828\u2014\u201c Most excellent Se\u00f1or, His Excellency \u201c the President having before him the note of your Excellency, \u201cnumbr. 27, of the 18th March last, with documents in which \u201c you report upon the State in which the foreigners are found \u201c who inhabit the twenty leagues bordering on the Sabine ; he \u201c has directed, in conformity with the statement of your Ex- \u201c cellency, that those who unite the circumstances of a peace- \u201c able demeanor and a useful vocation, may possess undisturbed \u201c the lands they have occupied.\u201d 2nd. The resolution of An gust, 1828,\u2014\u201c Most Excellent Se\u00f1or, His Excellency the \u201c Se\u00f1or President, having before him the note of your Excel- <em>\u201c </em>lency, dated the 28th of July last, accompanied by a docu- \u201c ment sent up by divers foreigners settled on the margin of \u201c the river Trinity and the rivulet San Jacinto, relating to \u201c lands being adjudicated to them in right of property, and \u201c manifesting that it is the opinion of that Government that \u201c said petition should be acceded to on the terms it proposes, \u201c he has been pleased to direct, that it be communicated to \u201c your Excellency in answer, that the Supreme Government \u201c approves the concession of the lands they solicit, with the <em>\u201c </em>qualfication that the parties interested conform to the gene- \u201c ral law of colonization of the 18th of August, 1824, and sub- \u201c ject to what has been reservedly said and repeated to that \u201c Government, especially in the note of the 20th April last \u201c relative to American families from the United States of the \u201c North.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">For the purpose of helping to explain these resolutions, we will also copy the petition of the inhabitants of the frontier of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>Nacogdoches, on which the resolution of April, 1828, was adopted, (these persons being the only ones with whom we have to do at present,) also a copy of the letter of the Secretary of State of Ooahuila and Texas, accompanying this petition ; and we give these documents for the further reason that they are not in print, and the profession may desire to see them.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">\u201c Most Ex. Se\u00f1or President:</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">\u201cThe inhabitants of the Republic of North America, \u201c settled on the twenty border leagues of the Republic of Mex- \u201c ico, between Nacogdoches and the Sabinas, with due respect \u201c to the exalted character of the Supreme Government, they \u201c represent to \"it that their settlement was effected, by a major- \u201c ty of them, before the sanctioning of the general law of colonization ; and by the others with the tacit consent of the \u201c local authorities, who did not embarrass it; and it may be \u201c said that they authorized it by assembling the inhabitants in \u201c order to be sworn to the Constitution of Mexico ; which was \u201c accomplished by them. They have constructed houses, cot- \u201c ton gins, mills, and opened large farms by great labor in \u201c making the necessary clearings on lands so rough ; where- \u201c fore, they have considerable improvements, which are found \u201c to be so near to each other, that a league could not be con- \u201c ceded to each individual, without prejudice to a third party ; \u201c that the ancient inhabitants of Nacogdoches have many \u201c claims on various portions of these lands, because they had peti- \u201c tioned the government for them ; but the parties representing, \u201c believe that all of them were not legitimately conceded to them ; \u201c and at their entrance in this country they were entirely aban- \u201c doned; wherefore, and because they did not occupy them (take \u201c possession of) in bad faith, they petition your Excellency to \u201c please concede to each one of the married men four labors \u201c and to single men one labor ; these tracts they believe to be \u201c sufficient to include their respective improvements, by author- \u201c lying to that effect the most Ex.

Complying with the order of the Su \u201c preme Government communicated through the ministry in \u201c your charge dated 15th May of the past year, relative to am- \u201c plifying the information given by this Government in letter \u201c No. 36, of the 24th of April last, relative to the number of '\u2022 foreigners settled from the creek 1 Atoyaque\u2019 to the river \u201c Sabinas, without the government permission, and who ask to \u201c be admitted, I proceed to state that by the four reports, \u201c copies of which I have the honor to herewith present to your Excellency, numbered from one to four, it is manifest \u201c that in the district of1 Ays \u2019 Bayou, \u2018 Sabinas \u2019 and \u2018 Tanaja,\u2019 \u201c there are settled 144 families and 34 single men; that they \u201c have four cotton gins and two corn mills, and those who are \u201c employed in working the land, have cleared and in farms \u201c (\u2018 labors,\u2019) 3365 arpents ; the others who are not employed 11 in farming, the reports referred to indicate their professed \u201c occupations. The buildings they inhabit are constructed of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>\u201c timber, covered with boards, and floored with plank. Their \u201c value is estimated from $200 to $800, each, according to its \u201c accommodation and capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">\u201c By reports from the district Alcaldes of the frontier, it ap- \u201c pears according to the lists referred to, that some individu- \u201c ais are not of good repute, perhaps on account of crimes \u201c committed in their native country, or on account of personal' \u201c moral defects ; criminals guilty of atrocious crimes, persons \u201c of infamous character, or the vicious who are prejudicial to \u201c society, beyond all doubt, should not be admitted in any part <em>\u201c </em>of the State. But those who are respectable, laborious and of \u201c good moral habits, who have constructed their houses and \u201c cultivated their fields, it seems advantageous to concede them \u201c permission for their permanently remaining in the country, \u201c with the qualification that they subject themselves, by oath, to \u201c the Constitution and laws of the nation and of the State ; and \u201c that in giving them possession, in due form, of' the land they \u201c occupy, according to the Colonization Laws of the State, the \u201c corresponding titles of property might be extended to them, <em>fl </em>they paying to the same State, by way of acknowledgment, the \u201c proportional rates designated in the Colonization Laws of \u201c the 24th of March, 1825, under the direction of a commis- \u201c sioner to that effect, who would be appointed by the govern- \u201c ment of this State according to Article 38 of said law. Inad- \u201c dition to the reasons already expressed in favor of those who \u201c could remain in the country, there is another of greater con- \u201c sideration ; and it is, that the inhabitants of the los1 Ays \u2019 ren- \u201c dered a very important service in favor of the government by \u201c openly declaring themselves against the revolutionary move- \u201c ment of Nacogdoches, raised by Haden Edwards and his as- \u201c sociates in December, 1826 ; and with their assistance the \u201c union of the perverse was broken up, and order, disturbed \u201c in that part of the State, was reestablished. Col. Don Jose \u201c de las Piedras, Military Commandant of Nacogdoches, no \u201c doubt with the best zeal and well disposed intention, agreed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>11 with the Alcalde of that town to receive the oaths of the \u201c foreign inhabitants of 1 los Ays, Tanaja and Sabinas/ to de- \u201c fend and observe the Federal and State Constitutions, the \u201c object being to prevent and avoid the disorders that had ex- \u201c isted on that frontier, as appears from the communications \u201c which the most Ex. Se\u00f1or Commandant General of these \u201c States directed to me, dated the 26th November last; a copy \u201c of which I herewith present to your Ex. (No. 5.) In answer \u201c I manifested to him on the 2nd January following, as will be \u201c seen by copy No. 6, that there would be a propriety in sus11 pending the oath of allegiance to both codes by foreigners \u201c who inhabit the twenty border leagues, for the reason that \u201c there is now pending the resolution of the Supreme Govern- \u201c ment, a document (expediente) sent up by the same inhabit- \u201c ants for their admission and permanency in the country : that \u201c measure, in such case, might anticipate or compromit the Su- <em>\u201c </em>preme determination of the affair, or might afford either a \u201c motive or pretext to the foreigners to found a right thereon, <em>\u201c </em>to their permanency in the State. The most Ex. Se\u00f1or Com- \u201c mandant General, impressed with the force of this observ- \u201c ation, and foreseeing the compromise that might result in 11 receiving the allegiance as agreed, he directed Col. Piedras \u201c on the 26th November, to suspend the said act, but at the \u201c arrival of his order it had already been verified, as may be \u201c seen in copy No. <em>7 </em>and its corresponding documents. Since \u201c that time, there came to my notice through the same most <em>u </em>Ex. Commandant General, that a sensation was caused \u201c among those inhabitants by an official communication from \u201c the Political Chief of the Department of Bexar to the Al- \u201c calde of Nacogdoches, asking information relating to the <em>u </em>order he had to accompany the Military Commandant of <em>\u201c </em>that town, to the oath he exacted of the foreigners who dwell <em>u </em>on the twenty border leagues. Although it appears the sens- \u201c ation did exist among the foreigners, as observed in the com- <em>\u201c </em>munication directed by Col. Piedras to Se\u00f1or Commandant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>\u201c General on the 8th of January of the current year ; this \u201c communication being one of the evidences accompanying the \u201c official communication numbered 8 of the 2nd March, that \u201c frontier is now peaceful, as is manifested in the official note \u201c of the Political Chief of the Department of Bexar of the 2nd \u201c inst. A copy of which is herewith presented with its accom- \u201c panying evidence numbered 8. In view of the whole of the \u201c aforesaid, and in view of the aspect this affair has taken, it \u201c seems the time has arrived to determine upon one of the two \u201c extremes: 1st. Either to regulate the civil or political exist- \u201c ence of those foreigners who at this day inhabit the\u201eborder \u201clands contiguous to Nacogdoches, by the means proposed; \u201c 2nd. Or to eject them from the territory of the Republic by \u201c armed force ; because it is impossible for them to remain \u201c longer in an undecided state,, engendering jealousy of their \u201c fidelity, in reason of their not being legally introduced and \u201c admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">\u201c The government of the State, if it were in its power, would \u201c have determined upon the first (of these extremes,) and it is \u201c its opinion that such should be declared, in attention to the \u201c reasons set forth, and which the accompanying documents \u201c themselves evince ; and because an absolute ejectment would \u201c be cruel, and expensive to our Republic. It would cause a \u201c revolution in that interesting part of the State, without any \u201c other fruit than desolation and death.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">\u201c All of which I have the honor to report to your Excellency \u201c for the information of the Supreme Government, whose su- \u201c preme resolve I venture to recommend that it be expedited \u201c at the earliest possible period.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">Now then the question is asked, if from all these documents it does not appear, that the resolution of April, 1828, did not embrace only the signers of the petition to which it responds, or at least those foreigners only who inhabited the twenty leagues bordering on the Sabine, at the date of the resolution ? and whether the grant is not cbnfined to the particular spots-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>of land which these persons occupied at that date ? and whether, since the 32nd Article of the law of 1834 professes to be in conformity to the resolutions of April and August, 1828, this Article is not to be restricted to this limited meaning of the resolution ? We answer, that be the interpretation and construction of the resolution of April, 1828, what it may, we do not think that the meaning of the 32nd Article of the law of 1834 is to be restricted to this limited sense. For, first, to confine it to the persons who signed the petition, or to those who inhabited the twenty leagues bordering on the Sabine, at the date of the resolution, is in direct war with the plain sense of the terms used in the 32nd Article to describe the persons whom it proposes to benefit. Secondly, such a construction is also in direct conflict with the other part of the Article, which says that the titles shall be issued according to Article 16 of the Colonization Law of the 24th of March, 1825. According to Article 16, the grants may extend to a league and labor ; but if the grant should only include the tract of land which each of the grantees occupied, or had in possession and cultivation, it could not be as extensive as grants under this 16tli Article ; since the petition of these persons represents their improvements \u201c to be so near to each other that a league could not be conceded to each individual without prejudice to a third party.\u201d Moreover, we presume that some of these persons occupied more land than others, and the letter of the Secretary of State accompanying the petition of these persons states, that some of them were not employed in farming, and of these some of them in all probability were mechanics, and some professional men, who occupied no lands at all; wherefore, to limit the grant to the land occupied by each individual would take away all benefit of the law from some, and make a disparity between the others, which we cannot presume to have been the intention of the framers of the law. But in granting them land in conformity with Article 16 of the Colonization Law of the 24th- of March, 1825, the Congress clearly express that there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>is to be no other distinction between the grantees than that there mentioned, of families and single men.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">How then shall we reconcile with this construction the reference to the resolution of April, 1828 ? Why, we must say, that either the proper construction of the resolution of April, 1828, agrees with this construction of the law of 1834, or, at least, that the Congress of Coahuila and Texas so understood it. And we would here have it kept in mind, that though the construction of the resolution should not agree with the construction we have drawn from the law, and the Congress of Coahuila and Texas should have misinterpreted the resolution, yet according to the principle we have before extracted from Goode v. McQueen, and Egery <em>&amp; </em>Smith v. Powers, the law of 1834 must prevail. To show, however, the accordance of .the resolution of April, 1828, with the 32nd Article of the law of the 26th of March, 1834, we will make the following extracts from the \u201c Statement of the Commissioner of the General Land Office,\u201d as they are very much to the purpose, and contain much historical information that we have not elsewhere. In treating of the resolution of April, 1828, he says : \u201c This grant \u201c is co-extensivc with the reasons by which it is recommended, \u201c to which consequently we must have recourse in order to un- \u201c derstand the extent of it; this is the Decree of April, 1828.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">\u201c The petition on which the Decree of August, 1828, is \u201c founded, is assigned (signed ?) by seventy-three persons whose \u201c names are preserved, being attached to a copy of the petition \u201c on file in the General Land Office ; but the names which \u201c were signed to the petition which produced the Decree of 61 April, 1828, are not preserved, nor does it appear that the \u201cnames were sent by the State to the Federal Executive, but \u201c at the conclusion of the copy of this petition which was sent \u201c up, the Secretary of State says : 1 Most Excellent President,\u2019 \u201c (here follows the signatures of one hundred and sixty-eight \u201c foreigners ;) \u2018 this is a copy, Juan Antonio Padillo.\u2019 The Seo- \u201c retary says, indeed, 1 that by the four communications which in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>\u201c copy I have the honor to forward to you, marked with the Nos. \u201c from one to four, it appears that in those districts of Bayou <em>\" </em>Ayisb, Sabine and Tenaha, there are settled 144 families and \u201c 34 single men.\u2019 This is represented as composing the entire \"\u25a0 population of these districts of country at the time ; but the \u201c names of the petitioners, as such, are not given.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">\u201c This petition is accompanied be a very able communiea- \u201c tion from the Secretary of State, Juan Antonio Padillo, in \u201c which he recommends it upon broad and general reasons of <em>\u201d </em>national policy. He says, \u2018 In view of all the foregoing, and \u201c in attention to the aspect this matter has taken, it seems that \u201c the time has arrived to resolve on one of two extremes : 1st. \u201c Either to regulate those foreigners who inhabit the boundary \" lands of Nacogdoches, by civil and political authority, by the \" means above proposed ; or 2d, that they shall be driven from \u201c the territory of the Republic by an armed force ; because it \u201c is impossible that they should remain for any longer time in \u201c an uncertain state, infusing doubts of their fidelity, for the \u201c reason that they are not legally introduced and admitted. \u201c The government of this State, if authorized, would have re- \u201c solved on the first, and it is of opinion that such should be \u201cthe declaration, in attention to the reasons that have been \u201c given, and which are contained in the annexed documents, \u201c and because an absolute ejectment of them would be cruel, \u201c and expensive to our Republic, which would give place to a \u201c revolution in that interesting portion of our State, without \u201c any other fruit than desolation and death.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">\u201c It will be readily perceived, that all the reasons here given <em>\u201c </em>are very general and comprehensive, and are not more appli- \u201c cable to those whose names were assigned to the original pe- \u201c tition, than to all others who were then settled on the bor- \u201c ders ; and notwithstanding some of the reasons adduced in \u201c this communication were applicable only to those who were \u201d then in the country, (such as the merit of having assisted in \u201c suppressing the Fredonians in Nacogdoches,) yet those above <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>\u201c quoted were not more applicable to persons then settled on \u201cthe borders, than to such as might come afterwards and \u201c whom the Commissioner might find within those limits when \u201c he came to put them in possession. That such was the con- \u201c struction placed on this Decree by the State authorities, I \u201c will proceed to show.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">\u201c It is a well known fact, that Juan Antonio Padillo came \u201c to Nacogdoches in the beginning of the year 1830, to give \u201c titles to settlers whose residence on the borders had been le- \u201c galized by the Decrees of April and August, 1828 ; it is also \u201c well known to those conversant with the history of those \u201c times, that he granted orders of survey, and took the incipi- <em>\u201c </em>ent steps towards extending titles to all those who produced \u201c the proper proof of the moral qualifications required by those \u201c Decrees, or, more properly speaking, by the Colonization \u201c Laws of the State. Under the authority of those orders of \u201c survey, a large amount of surveying was done, when he was \u201c suddenly arrested on a charge of being accessory to the mur- <em>\u201c </em>der of a Mexican, and being under a criminal prosecution, \u201c his functions as Commissioner were necessarily suspended \u201c according to the Constitution of the State, until his trial and \u201c acquittal. (Laws and Decrees of Coahuila and Texas, page \u201c 316.)</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\"><em>\u201c </em>Jose Francisco Medero was appointed in September of the \u201c same year to supply his place as Commissioner. The Gov- \u201c ernor, after having directed him to proc\u00fare from Padillo the \u201c various documents in relation to his commission, says to him, \u201c1 And with the entire regulation of the instructions and or- \u201c ders which have been passed to him, you will proceed to the \u201c conclusion of this business, <em>tvithout changing anything' which \u201c has been done by the former Commissioner, without the express </em>\u201c <em>orders of this Government.\u2019 \u201d </em>(Vol. 44, p. 2, Archives Gen. Land Office.)</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">To the same purport 1 will now quote from a letter from Juan Davis Bradburn to Medero, dated Jan. 29th, 1831. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>\u201c Military Commandancy of Galveston. In the Texas Ga- \u201c zette of the 15th instant I have read with great satisfaction \u201c the notice which you give to the public of your arrival at \u201c San Felipe de Austin with the special commission to conclude \u201c the business pending of Juan Antonio Padillo, and the invi- \u201c tation which you give to those whose lands are not yet de- \u201c lineated, being one of the measures most interesting to the \u201c happiness of the country.\u2019 (Vol. 44, p. 5.)</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">\u201c I will now quote from a resolution of the Council of Gov- <em>\u201c </em>ernment of the State dated August 5th, 1833. 1 The same \u201c practice should be observed with regard to those concessions \u201c which were made by the Citizen Juan Antonio Padillo in the \u201c time that he was Commissioner and the acting Surveyor, the \u201c parties interested not having obtained their titles. Inasmuch as \u201c the Citizen Juan Antonio Padillo does not <em>noto </em>possess autho- \u201c rity for the purpose of completing them, it is reasonable that \u201c he who despatches the titles should regulate the surveys, as he \u201c is personally responsible for all the acts or measures effected <em>\u201c </em>or practised by him in contravention of the Law of Coloni- \u201c zation.\u2019 (Vol. 51, p. 105.)</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">\u201c Again, in recapitulating,13rd. The concessions which have \u201c been spoken of in the preceding articles, which were sur- \u201c veyed by the citizen Juan Antonio Padillo in the time that \u201c he was Commissioner, the owners of which have not received \u201c their titles, shall be resurveyed according to the law under <em>\u201c </em>which they were granted.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">\u201c This, in effect, was uniformly done; the land was either re- \u201c surveyed, or (which more frequently happened,) the Surveyor \u201c who did the work, took an appointment as Surveyor under \u201c the new Commissioner and returned his work under his re- \u201c sponsibility to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-8\">\u201c I will here quote again from the communication of the Po- \u201c litical Chief to the Military Commander of Texas. He says : \u201c \u2018 The foreigners <em>who reside (que redden) </em>between the rivers \u201c Trinity and San Jacinto, and from the Atoyaque to the Sabine, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>\u201c have obtained this approbation, the second by the Decree of 11 of the 22d April, and the first, by that of the 27th of August, \u201c 1828.\u2019 This communication is dated February, 1831. He \u201c speaks in the present tense\u2014\u2018 the foreigners <em>who </em>reside.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">\u201c If we now turn to the 32nd Article of the law of 1834, we . \u201c shall find it to the same purport. \u2018 To the inhabitants of the \u2022 \u201c frontier of Nacogdochs, and those residing east of Austin\u2019s \u201c Colonies, titles shall be issued,\u2019 &amp;c. This language plainly \u201c and literally construed, certainly embraces all the inhabitants \u201c east of Austin\u2019s Colonies and on the frontier of Nacogdoches \u201c at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">\u201c I will add another quotation which is translated from the \u201c commission of one appointed under the authority of the Ar- \u201c tide above quoted. The Governor says : \u2018In exercise of the \u201c powers conferred on me by the 32nd Article of the law of \u201c the 26th of March of the year last passed, relative to the va- \u201c cant lands of the State, I have appointed him Special Com- \u201c missionerfor the issuing of titles to <em>the inhabitants who reside \u201cin the Department of Nacogdoches. </em>\u2019 (Vol. 24, p. 1.)</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">\u201c Let us now introduce the following communication from <em>\u201c </em>the Political Chief of the Department of Bexar to the Gov- \u201c ernor of the State, on the subject of these border league set- \u201c tiers, and which is strongly corroborative of the position \u201chere assumed. It may be remarked concerning the docu- \" ment here translated, as well as some others, that it does not \u201c wear an imposing official garb, being a \u201c borador,\u201d or rough \u201c draft of the communication <em>sent. </em>Nevertheless it is found \u201c among the archives received from Bexar, and there is suffi- \u201c cient evidence of its genuineness.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-8\">\u201c\u2018No. 111. <em>Most Excellent </em>Sir:\u2014By verbal information \u201c received from the citizen Stephen F.

(\u2018 Mira y atiende al aument y \u201c siguridad de sus personas y intereses.') But nevertheless it \u201c appears to me proper that I should manifest to your Excel- \u201c lency, that nothing but the immediate presence of a Cornmis- \u201c sioner on that frontier will be able to cause these errors to \u201c vanish, which these inhabitants have practiced on them- \u201c selves ; disposing, if possible, that the Commissioner to regu- \u201c late the business of the settlers established within the said \u201c twenty border leagues, falls on a person illustrious for his \u201c judgment and prudence; that he may be able without dis- <em>\u201c </em>turbance or reproach to level whatever difficulties may pre- <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>\u201c sent themselves, whether in consequence of the claims of the \u201c ancient citizens of Nacogdoches, or those which are offered \u201c by the labors which have been commenced in those points by 11 the said Commissioner and Surveyor.

This was the policy recom- \u201c mended to the General Government by Padillo himself as \u201c Secretary of State. This was the policy pursued by the Fed- <em>\u201c </em>eral Executive in making the liberal grant of April, 1828, \u201c which resulted in the appointment of Padillo as Commis- \u201c sioner, and now on the occurrence of his arrest and the sus- \u201c pension of his functions as Commissioner, this policy is \u201c pressed upon the attention of the State Executive, as the on- \u201c ly means of allaying the excitement and reconciling the peo- \u201c pie to the Government. One very striking contrast, how- <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>\u201c ever, presents itself between this communication of the Poli- \u201c tical Chief, and that of the Secretary of State, which pro- \u201c duced the decree of April, 1828 ; the former was addressed \u201c to the Federal Executive, but now the consent of the Fed- \u201c eral Government having been obtained, the latter is addressed \u201c to the Governor of the State, as the functionary who alone \u201c possessed the power of applying .the proper remedy. The \u201c instruction to Medero (who was appointed in the latter part \u201c of the same year) \u2018 not to change anything which had been \u201c done by the former Commissioner, without the express orders \u201c of the Government,\u2019 was carrying out the same views and \u201c consummating the same policy. By the way it may be re- \u201c marked that in this document the first reference is made to \u201c the \u2018 inhabitants residing East of Austin\u2019s Colony,\u2019 as contra- \u201c distinguished from those upon the border leagues, a distinc- \u201c tion which was afterwards incorporated into the 32d Article \u201c of the law of the 26th of March, 1834.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">\u201c The Political Chief in the document here translated, speaks \u201c of the inhabitants generally, and not-of a portion of these in- \u201c habitants, and he recommends a general measure of conciliation for the purpose of \u2018tranquilizing these inhabitants.\u2019\u2014 \u201c Now since the petition of the people of these districts in \u201c 1827, or the decree of the Federal Executive in 1828, their \u201c population was probably doubled, and it cannot be fairly in- \u201c ferred, that this measure of conciliation was intended to ex- \u201c tend to those only who resided in the country in 1827 or \u201c 1828, which would have been but a partial remedy\u2014contra- \u201c ry to the language used, and contrary to the objects to be ae- \u201c complished. But was the Polical Chief recommending to the \u201c Governor a high handed measure in violation of the rights \u201c of the Federal Government ? Shall presumption be perpetm \u201c ally indulged against the acts of the State authorities ?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">\u201c It appears unquestionably, from the foregoing communica- \u201c tion of the political Chief, that in his opinion as well as those \u201c of Messrs. Austin and Chambers, the power of\u2018tranquilizing\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>\u201c the people and removing all their apprehensions by granting \u201c them titles to their lands, vested exclusively in the State \u201c Government. Abundant evidence might be adduced to show \u201c that the people of the twenty border leagues held the same \u201c opinions, and that to quiet their apprehensions on the sub- \u201c ject of their lands, it was only necessary to convince them \u201c of the 1 paternal affection \u2019 of the State Government. As- <em>\u201c </em>corroborative of this statement I will here transcribe a para- \u201c graph from a circular letter, addressed by the latter gentle- \u201c man to the people of that district, dated July 1st, 1830 :</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">\u201c He says : \u2018 But I have the fullest confidence in the paternal \u201c affection of the <em>Government of the State </em>towards these colon- \u201c ists, and in the liberal policy of the distinguished statesman \u201c who directs its helm ; and I am informed that measures are \u201c taking for the prompt conclusion of the business,\u2019 (i. e. the \u201c business commened by Padillo.) The only object in trans- \u201c cribing the above passage is to show, that the only argument; \u201c thought necessary to be used with these people at this period, <em>\u201c </em>was to assure them of the 1 paternal affection of <em>the Govern- </em>\u201c <em>men\u00fa of the State.\u2019 </em>As further evidence that the people re- \u201c lied exclusively on the State Government, it may be stated, \u201c that with one single exception\u2014that referred to and eon- \u201c demned by Medero in his letter already quoted,\u2014no attempt \u201c seems to have been made by the people settled in those dis- \u201c tricts, to obtain the approbation of the General Government \u201c subsequent to 1828 ; with such implicit confidence did they \u201c rely upon the opinion, that the prohibition of the General \u201c Government was entirely removed with regard to them- \u201c selves.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">The author of \u201c the statement,\u201d after refering to the various decrees of the Legislature of Coahuila and Texas, and' giving-them a construction, about which, there, perhaps, might be some difference of opinion, proceeds with observations, which might well apply to the 32d Article of the decree of the 26th of March, 1834, and the acts of the officers charged with its-administration, (viz:)</p>\n<p id=\"b647-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number><em>\u201c </em>Moreover these Acts of the State authorities were done with \u201c the knowledge of the Federal Government, and if not with \u201c its approbation, at least without any complaint on its part. \u201c Of the truth of this assertion, the annulling Act furnishes <em>\u201c </em>strong presumptive evidence, for in that Act they assume the \u201c high prerogative of annulling an Act of the Legislature of a \u201c sovereign State\u2014thus evincing that the Acts of the State <em>\u201c </em>authorities did not escape their notice, and that they were \u201c not over scrupulous in animadverting on such as did not \u201c suit them. But so far as the State is concerned, her inten- <em>\u201c </em>tion at this period is beyond all question.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">Again\u2014\u201c In the case of the heirs of McQueen v. Samuel \u201c Goode, the Supreme Court held the following language : \u2018 It <em>\u201c </em>is clear that whatever obscurities there may be in the law \u201c referred to, its benefits were designed for those only \u201c who at the time occupied the lands for which they were to \u201c receive titles.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">\u201c All the circumstances considered, it is not astonishing that \u201c the Supreme Court should have come to this conclusion : the \u201c various documents which throw light upon this subject were \u201c not before the Court. Even the decree of April, 1828, was \u201c not before them. Nevertheless, if the Court intended to be \u201c understood by this, that the settler was bound to be an actu- \u201c al resident on the very spot included in his survey, in order \u201c to make his title valid, I am forced, however reluctantly, to \u201c come to a different conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-8\">\u201c Let us endeavor to trace this phrase, 1 <em>que ocupen,\u2019 </em>which \u201c occurs in the 82d Article of the law of 1834 to its origin.\u2014 \u201c In the year 1827, the people of the Ayish Bayou, &amp;c., &amp;e., \u201c addressed a petition to the Federal Executive of Mexico j \u201c they represented among other things, that they were not only \u201c settled on the border leagues, but they were likewise settled \u201c on certain old claims which had been granted to the ancient \u201c inhabitants of Nacogdoches ; but that inasmuch as they found \u201c the country abandoned at their ingress, they were not 1 <em>occu</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number><em>\u201cpants in bacl faith;' </em>they also represented that they were \u201c settled so near each other, that they would not be able to \u201c get a league of land without interfering with each other ; \u201c they therefore prayed the Government to grant to each fam- \u201c ily four labors o\u00ed land, and to each single man one labor, with <em>\u201c </em>the extraordinary privilege of taking the lands which they \u201c occupied, notwithstanding it had been previously granted to \u201c others.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">\u201c The Governor of the State in forwarding this petition to \u201c the General Government, (as already stated,) accompanied it \u201c with an elaborate and able communication from the Secretary <em>\u201c </em>of State, in which he urges by many cogent reasons of na- <em>\u201c </em>tional policy, the propriety of admitting them to the priv- \u201c ileges of colonists. He says: 1 But those who are moral and \u201c industrious, of good moral habits, who have made their hous- \u201c es and farms with utility ; it seems proper to grant them \u201c permission to remain permanently in the country, with the \u201c condition of subjecting themselves, by the oath of allegiance, \u201c to the constitution and laws of the nation and of the State; \u201c and that possession be given them in due form, of the land \u201c which they occupy, according to the law of colonization of \u201c the State ; granting to them the correspondent titles of pro- \u201c perty ; (they) paying to the State as an acknowledgment, the \u201c proportional charges indicated by the law of colonization of \u201c the State, of the 24th of March, 1825, under the direction of \u201c a Commissioner appointed for the purpose by the Government <em>\u201c </em>of this State, according to the 38th Article of said law.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">\u201c Here the privilege which they asked in their petition, of <em>\u201c </em>having the lands granted them which they <em>occupied, </em>notwith- \u201c standing the pre-existing claims to the same land, was re- \u201c commended by the State Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">\u201c In the decree of the President their desire is again re- \u201c sponded to affirmatively ; this decree is as follows : \u2018He\u2019 \u201c (the President) \u2018 has ordered, in conformity with the repre- \u201c sentation of your Excellency, that those who unite the cir- <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>\u201c cumstances of a pacific conduct to some useful profession, \u201c shall have quiet possession of the lands which they have \u00a9c- \u201c cupied.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">\u201c Thus I have endeavored to trace the expression <em>\u2018que ocw\u201cpen' </em>which occurs in the 32d Article of the law of the 26th \u201c of March, 1834, from its origin, through the ramifications of \u201c the various documents accompanying the resolution of the \u201c Federal Government of Mexico of 1828, and connected with \u201c it. I will now trace it through the resolution of August of \u201c the same year. The people in their petition say : \u2018 Since not- \u201c withstanding the General Congress suspended this law,\u2019 (law \u201c of the 4th of Feb., 1823,) 1 on the 14th of April of the same \u201c year, this decree was not published, for which reason it could \u201c not be known ; that about the middle of the year 1825, there \u201c came to their notice\u2019 (i. e., the petitioners,) \u2018 the second gen- \u201c eral law of colonization of the 18th of August, 1824, which \u201c excepts (\u2018except\u00faa&gt;\u2019) the border and littoral lands. In virtue \u201c of which they did <em>occupy this (\u2018ocupaban este\u2019) </em>in good faith, \u201c improving so far as they were able, persuaded that the lands \u201c which they occupied, (\u2018ocuparan\u2019) according to the provisions \u201c of said law of the 4th of Feb., 1823, would be partitioned to \u201c them, which law did not <em>except </em>(\u2018except\u00faa\u2019) any land.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">\u201c In this petition, expressions derived from the verb \u2018ocupar\u201d \u201c \u2018 to ocoupy, to take possession of,\u2019 twice occur, evidently re- \u201c fering in the first expression, and most probably in the second \u201c also, not to the particular spot which they may chance to \u201c have inhabited, but to the ten coast leagues as the <em>place </em>of \u201c their residence\u2014\u2018 which excepted the border and littoral \u201c lands. In virtue of which they did occupy <em>this </em>in good \u201c faith.\u2019 The pronoun <em>este, this, </em>as is well known, has the same \u201c meaning in Spanish that it has in English : it refers to the \u201c last thing spoken of, which in this case was the coast \u201c leagues.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">\u201c The Governor forwards this petition, and recommends in \u201c general terms, that1 those inhabitants should have land con- <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>\u201c formally to the law of colonization, provided always that \u201c they combine the qualities and circumstances which this law \u201c enacts ; that they subject themselves to the law, Federal and \u201c State, and that composing part of the families to which the \u201c land corresponds which they respectively inhabit, they may \u201c be considered as new colonists, and be subject to the burdens \u201c and obligations of such.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">\u201c The decree of the Federal Executive says : \u2018He\u2019 (the Pres- \u201c ident) 1 has seen proper to direct me to say to your Excel- \u201c lency in reply, that the Supreme Government approves the \u201c concession of the lands which they ask, upon the condition \u201c that they conform to the general law of colonization of the \u201c 18th of August, 1824/ Ac.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">\u201c The Governor of the State, in communicating this resolu- \u201c tion to the political Chief of the Department of Bexar, says: \u201c 1 For the adjudication of lands to the foreigners of which it \u201c treats, I will commission a person of my confidence, that he \u201c may carry it into effect in conformity to the laws and in- \u201c structions in the matter.\u2019 What laws ? What instructions ? \u201c Evidently the laws of colonization, and the instructions to \u201c Commissioners of the 4th of September, 1827.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">\u201c The Political Chief, in acknowledging the receipt of the *\u25a0 foregoing communication, says to the Governor : 1 Most Excel- \u201c lent Sir : The order of his Excellency, the President of the \u201c Republic, of the 27 th of August of the present year, which your \u201c Excellency was pleased to inclose to me in your official com- \u201c munication of the 11th of November last past, by which is \u201c conceded to the foreigners who have established themselves \u201c upon the margin of the river Trinity and creek San Jacinto, <em>\u201c </em>the right of property to the lands which they <em>occivpy, </em>with <em>\u201c </em>the pre-requisite that they owe subjection to the general law \u201c of colonization, and other orders relative to the introduction <em>\u201c </em>of North American families ; and that they present them- \u201c selves to the Commissioner whom the Supreme Government \u201cwill nominate, in order that he\" may give possession and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>\u201c\u2022 issue the titles to said lands.\u2019 Here the word occupy again \u201c occurs, though not found in either of the previous communi- \u201c cations of the President or Governor.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">\u201c The next occasion in which this word \u2018ocwpar\u2019 1 to occupy, \u201c to take possession of,\u2019 or its derivatives appears, is in the \u201c 32d Article of the law of the 26th of March, 1834, in which \u201c this language occurs : \u2018 To the inhabitants of the frontier of \u201c Nacogdoches, and those residing east of Austin\u2019s Colonies, \u201c titles shall be issued to the <em>lands they may occupy, </em>accord- \u201c ing to Article 16 of the law of colonization, of the 24th of \u201c March, 1825,\u2019 &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;e.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">\u201c Thus I have endeavored to trace this expression through \u201c all its ramifications, from its first inception in the petition of <em>\u201c </em>the people of the frontier of Nacogdoches, down to its con- \u201c summation in the 32d Article of the law of 1834, in none of \u201c which has it been intended, as I conceive, as a restriction on \u201c the privileges of the settlers; and to this conclusion I am led \u201c by the following reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">\u201c The whole tenor of the recommendation of the State Gov- \u201c ernment to the petition of these settlers, was that all cause \u201c of complaint should be removed from them, by placing them \u201c on a footing of the most perfect equality with settlers in \u201c other portions of the country; hence it is recommended that \u201c lands should be granted to them according to the colonization \u201c laws, which would, of course, have been a league or rather a \u201c league and labor to each family; but this privilege would have \u201c been perfectly nugatory, if they could only have taken the spot \u201c on which they claimed to be settled, for they had already repre- \u201c sented to the Government, that they could not obtain more \u201c than one-sixth of this quantity where they were settled, with- <em>\u201c </em>out interfering with each other. Moreover, the State Gov- \u201c ernment represented that some of these settlers were not ag- \u201c riculturists, some of the latter class might have been mechanics, others were probably professional men; most of these \u201c must have been entirely cut off from the benefits of the pro- <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>\u201c vision. Again : it was represented that there were thirty- \u201c four single men ; for these the petitioners asked one' labor ; \u201c but as is usually the case with such persons, most of these \u201c young men were probably attached to other families, and \u201c were not settled on any land which they could call their own \u201c under this restriction of the grant. But neither the State \u201c nor General Government manifested the slightest disposition \u201c to curtail the petitioners, in the privileges asked by them.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">\u201c This construction of the law is likewise opposed by the \u201c whole current of cotemporaneous construction ; and in proof <em>\u201c </em>of this, I need only to produce two examples: The first is \u201c that of Juan Antonio Padillo. Whatever authority that \u201c Commissioner possessed, of granting lands on the border \u201c leagues, was under the resolutions of the Federal Govern- \u201c ment of April and August, 1828, and his appointment by the \u201c State Government as Commissioner General of the .State ; \u201c but he was far from confining the settlers to the lands on \u201c which they were settled. Now we have in the Land Office \u201c a resolution of the Council of Government of the State of \u201c Coahuila and Texas, censuring severely many of the measures \u201c of Padillo\u2014charging him with an usurpation of powers <em>\u201c </em>which belonged exclusively to the Legislature. Yet no com- <em>\u201c </em>plaint is made, that he had allowed settlers to survey lands \u201c on which they did not reside, though the fact must have been \u201c well known. (Vol. 51, Page 85.)</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">\u201c In proof that the State Government did not complain, but \u201c actually recognized the acts of Padillo, I refer to the quota- \u201c tions already made from a resolution of the Council of Gov- &lt;! ernment of the 5th of August, 1833.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">\u201c Again : Jose Francisco Medero, was commissioned by the \u201c State, to complete the unfinished business of Padillo, and \u201c grant titles to lands under the resolutions of April and August, 1828. It is a well known fact, that he was watched \u201c with the most jealous vigilance by Col. Bradburn, Military \u201c Commandant of Anahuac ; it is also well known to many, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>\u201c who were witnesses, that he was conveyed by Bradburn from \u201c Liberty to Anahuac, and there kept in confinement for some \u201c time as a prisoner. He was finally released and suffered to \u201c proceed with his duties as Commissioner, still closely watched \u201c in all his movements by Bradburn. Yet he by no means <em>\u201c </em>confined the settlers to the lands on which they actually re- \u201c sided, but suffered them to go and select their lands, as all \u201c other settlers had been allowed to do, in other portions of \u201c the country. But this did not so much as afford a pretext \u201c to the military officer who watched him, ready to take ad- \u201c vantage of every false step. Nor do I find in the official \u201c correspondence in relation to Padillo and Medero, any com- \u201c plaint that they granted lands to those who were not in \u201c actual occupancy of the land granted at the time the grant \u201c was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">\u201c Padillo\u2019s title to James Gaines begins as follows : 1 Juan \u201c Antonio Padillo, Commissioner General of the Supreme Gov- <em>\u201c </em>ernment of the State of Coalmila and Texas, for the partition \u201c of the vacant lands of said State : For as much as James \u201c Gaines has been received as a <em>new settler, (nuevo </em>poblador,) \u201c in the twenty leagues bordering on the Sabine, in virtue of <em>\u201c </em>the resolution of the Supreme Government of Mexico, of the \u201c 22d of April, 1828, and the said James having proved that \u201c he is married, and unites in Ms person the requisites of the \u201c law of colonization of this State of the 24th of March, 1825 ; \u201c in conformity with said law, and the instructions which \u201c govern me, of the 11th of September, 1827,\u2019 &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">\u201c And again in its proper place in the title he says : 1 re- \u201c maining notified that within one year he is bound to con- \u201c struct permanent land marks in every corner of the survey, \u201c <em>and that he is bound to settle and cultivate it in conformity </em>\u201c <em>with the provisions of said law. </em>(Vol. 38, Page 782.)</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">\u201c The word 1 occupy \u2019 entering, as I have shown, into every \u201c document on the subject of these lands, from the petition of \u201c the settlers down to the 32d Article of the law of 1834; if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number><em>\u201c </em>the benefits of the latter law extended to those only, \u2018 who at \u201c the time occupied the land for which they were to receive \u201c titles,\u2019 it is manifest that the powers of Padillo and Medero \u201c were restrained to the same class, as the same term occurs \u201c in the decrees of April and August, 1828 ; but the introduc- \u201c tion of the condition in these titles, to 1 settle and cultivate \u201c it in conformity to law,\u2019 would be an absurdity, if this con- \u201c struction were correct; and to use the very appropriate \u201c language of the Supreme Court: \u2018 This is a practical illustra- \u201c tion of the construction given at that time, not only to the \u201c law, but also to the forms to be observed in obtaining rights \u201c under it; and it is entitled to great consideration, because \u201c of its occurence so soon after the establishment of the system.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">\u201c It is entitled to 1 great consideration \u2019 on another account. \u2018\u2018 Padillo was the Secretary of State who recommended the \u201c petition which produced the decree of April, 1828, and his \u201c able communication doubtless had its share of influence in \u201c producing the favorable result. No man could understand \u201c better than he, the scope and intention of those decrees of \u201c the Federal Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">\u201c Medero was also an intelligent man, a jurist of reputation, <em>\u201c </em>a member of the Congress of Coahuila and Texas at the time \u201c the State colonization law of 1825 was passed, and was not <em>\u201c </em>likely to be mistaken on this subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">\u201c Medero\u2019s titles are in substance the same as those of Padil- \u201c lo ; he refers to all the laws and instructions referred to by \u201c by the latter, and says : 1 he shall settle and cultivate it ac- \u201c cording to the provisions of said law.\u2019 (Vol. 38, Page 832.)</p>\n<p id=\"b654-8\">\u201c And this I conceive to have been in strict conformity to the <em>\u201c </em>resolutions of April and August, 1828, that they should \u2018 be <em>\u201c </em>considered as new colonists and be subject to the burdens \u201c and obligations of such.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b654-9\"><em>\u201c </em>Medero also had the town of Liberty laid off, and organ- \u201c ized the municipality of Liberty, which was soon after <em>\u201c </em>acknowledged as one of the municipalities of the State ; thus \u201c fulfilling another provision of the resolutions of 1828, viz: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>\u201c that the Commissioner should be appointed under the 38th \u201c Article of the colonization law of 1825.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">And again\u2014\u201c There is one other point from which we will \u201c view this question. The 32d Article, already referred to, \u201csays: 1 To the inhabitants of the frontiers of Nacogdoches, \u201c and those residing east of Austin\u2019s Colonies, titles shall be \u201c issued to the lands which they may occupy,\u2019 &amp;c. It is very \u201c plain, that this article embraces in its terms, all the settlers \u201c between the eastern boundary of Austin\u2019s Colonies and the \u201c Sabine, and it is equally plain that the application of the \u201c term \u2018 <em>que ocupen </em>\u2019 is co-extensive with the persons included \u201c in the Article ; the municipality of Nacogdoches extended \u201c over the same district of country, except that portion which \u201c had been cut out of it to form the municipality of San Augus- \u201c tine ; part of the population included within the jurisdiction \u201c of Nacogdoches resided on the border leagues and part of \u201c them did not. It is evident that whatever restriction the \u201c 4th Article of the national law might have laid those under, \u201c residing on the border, it could not possibly affect the rights \u201c of those injuriously, who resided westward of those limits.\u2014 \u201c They possessed all the rights secured to them by the coloni- \u201c zation law of 1825, and it cannot be supposed for a moment, \u201c that it was the intention of the Legislature of Coahuila and \u201c Texas, to take from them by the law of 1834, any of the \u201c rights which they possessed under the previous law. We \u201c are under the necessity, therefore, of giving to this expression \u201c a construction which will not interfere with the previously \u201c acquired rights of the settler under the 1Amparo\u2019 ; but this \u201c construction, to be consistent, must be general, as it is equally \u201c extended in the 32d Article to all who are embraced in it.\u201d In making these extracts from \u201c the statement,\u201d we are not to be regarded as assenting to all the views and reasons of its author, but they are the opinions of a gentleman of high intelligence, conversant with the subject, and whether they succeed, or not in satisfying the mind, of the correctness of the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>struction put by their author, on the resolutions' of April and August, 1828, are yet sufficient to show, by their reason, but particularly by their evidence of the construction placed on the resolutions on and after their adoption, and especially by those who acted under them, that it is most probable that this was the view taken of the resolutions by the framers of the law of the 26th of March, 1834. And when, to this we add, that no other interpretation of the resolutions will agree so well with the plain and obvious meaning of the 32nd Article of this law, we are forced to conclude that such was the fact; and whether the Congress of Coahuila and Texas was right or wrong in their construction, is immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">To the view we have taken of the 32d Article of the law of the 26th of March, 1834, we would add, that such was the construction given to the law by the Commissioner who was appointed to issue the titles under it; and it is said in the case of Jenkins v. Chambers, 9 Tex. B. p. 235 : \u201c We have hereto- \u201c fore decided that the construction of their powers and of the \u201c laws which conferred them, adopted and acted, upon by the \u201c former authorities of the country, must be respected, unless \u201c it be clearly shown that they have exceeded their powers, or \u201c have acted in <em>manifest </em>contravention of law. (Hancock v. \u201c McKinney, 1 Tex. R. 384.) <em>Acts done, and rights justly ac- </em>\u201c <em>quired under such </em>construction, <em>will not be </em>disturbed.\u201d Now a great many titles were issued by the Commissioner, under this construction of the law, which acts were never questioned at the time ; and a multitude of rights have been justly acquired under such construction ; to overthrow which by a subsequent construction at this day, would inflict such extensive and serious injury, that we shrink from its accomplishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">In conclusion we would add, that we think it in proof from the history of this State, that the titles issued by the Commissioner under the 32d Article of the law of the 26th of March, 1834, have always been regarded by the Government as valid; and have even had its express sanction and assent. Thus in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>less than five months after the date of the grant in this case, and in one year, one month and six days after the date of the commission, under which all the titles under the 32d Article of the law of the 26th of March, 1834, issued, when we may suppose that these titles were fresh in mind, the convention which framed the constitution of the Republic, while- legislating against illegal grants, and declaring void all eleven league claims located in the twenty border leagues, (which claims issued under the laws of the 20th March, 1825, and 2d of May,. 1832, which continued the restriction on the settlement of the border leagues, prescribed in the national colonization law of the 18th of August, 1824,) yet made no question of the grants for a league and labor issued by the Commissioner under the 32d Article of the law of the 26th of March, 1834. And again, on the 9th of January, 1841, the Congress of the Republic of Texas, while declaring by law, that it appeared that the location of land claims made prior to the 17th of March, 1836, on the twenty frontier leagues bordering on the United States of the North, were contrary to law, and that there was good reason to believe that the claims in their origin were for the most part fraudulent and void ; and providing that suit should be brought by all persons claiming to hold lands within the above mentioned border leagues, by virtue of any location made prior to the 17th of March, 1836, who might wish to try the validity of their claims ; expressly enact, \u201c that nothing herein con- \u201c tained shall prejudice or invalidate the settlement or head- \u201c right claims of any citizens residing within the twenty bor- \u201c der leagues, heretofore located and surveyed, whose claim \u201c shall not exceed one league and labor of land.\u201d And this Act expresses to be intended \u201c that the claims of the people \u201c within the above mentioned border leagues, <em>may be quieted \u201c and </em>settledThis law we look upon as an express sanction and approval of the titles which issued under the 32d Article of the law of the 26th of March, 1834. And in all the legislation of this State against illegal and fraudulent claims, we find <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>not one instance where any question has been expressed or intimated of the validity of these titles.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">The judgment of the District Court is reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
