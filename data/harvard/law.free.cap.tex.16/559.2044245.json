They do not undertake to pay upon the refusal of Irwin to accept and pay said order. In order to recover judgment against the defendants, it was necessary for plaintiff to have averred that said order was given for a valuable consideration, (stating the consideration,) and also that the money had been collected by Irwin, and that he had failed and refused to pay it over, or that defendant had no funds in his hands to collect.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b566-5\"><em>S. 3. </em>Morgan, for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b566-6\">Wheeler, 'J.</author>\n<p id=\"AqG\">The amendment to the petition averred a consideration for the giving of the order.
