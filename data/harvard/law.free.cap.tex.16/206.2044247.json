Without touching the Common Law definition of murder, the Legislature have added one element to constitute murder in the first degree,\u2014not necessary at Common Law to constitute the offence of murder, to wit, deliberation,\u2014 they have declared, that there is and shall be such an offence as murder in the first degree, and murder in the second degree. They have drawn no distinction between express and implied malice,\u2014for, by the terms of the statute, cases of implied malice are made murder in the first degree.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b217-9\">The Constitution securing to every citizen prosecuted \u201c The right to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation,\u201d and the due course of the law of the land giving the right to know the <em>species </em>of offence with which he is charged, can the Court disregard these safeguards (for the security of the accused,) and when one species of offence is charged, give judgment for a different and higher species of offence, more aggravated in its nature, and in which the highest and last penalty human ingenuity can inflict is to be the result of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>judgment ? The words \u201c premeditated and deliberate killing \" embrace the statutory description and ingredients necessary to constitute murder in the first degree. The words premeditated and deliberate are not synonymous ; \u201c premeditated killing \" and \u201cdeliberate killing\" do not convey the same idea ; and both are necessary to constitute murder in the first degree. When used in the Act and in-an indictment, they indicate the existence of certain facts necessary to be proved on the trial; and according to the ruling of this Court, in the case of Jones vs. The State, (12 Texas R.,) the onus of proving the facts . necessary to make the offence murder in the first degree rests on the State.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b218-5\">\u25a0 In the case of the State v. Sam. M. Williams et al., decided at a former Term of this Court, (14 Tex. R. 98,) the Court say, \u201c But it may be said that according to some of the author\u201cities cited as exceptions to the general rule, it is said, that \u201c those facts must be proven, but need not be averred. <em>Shall \u201c we follow such </em>authorities, <em>so unreasonable, </em>so well calculated \u201c to surprise the accused ? or shall we not rather, with Chief \u201c Justice Gibson, regard the description of the offence as of \u201c the last importance to the innocent, for it is that which marks \u201c the limits of the accusation, and fixes the proof of it.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b218-6\">To say that the Courts in other States have given a construction to similar statutes, and that the ruling of the Court in this case is sustained by such construction, is not and should not be conclusive in the Courts of this State. Our statute is not identical with the statutes of Tennessee, Pennsylvania, or any other State, the reports of the decisions in the Courts whereof I have .had an opportunity of examining. In Tennessee, by an express provision, a Common Law indictment is declared to be sufficient to charge murder in the first or second degree. In all of those States, the word deliberate precedes the word \u201c premeditated,\u201d and the construction is given to the word deliberate, as the action of the mind in deciding the party to kill; the word premedited embracing the idea of fore<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>thought and determination to kill. The word premeditated in onr statute preceding the word \u201c deliberatethe forethought and determination to kill exists independent of it, and deliberation must refer not only to the conclusion of the mind, but to the manner of executing the foregone determination to MU. It is by this construction alone that you can give effect to the statute, and draw a distinction between murder in the first and second degree.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b219-5\">II.\u2014As to the second point: by our statute regulating juries, it is provided that when from challenges or any other cause, there shall not be a jury to determine any cause, civil or <em>criminal, </em>which shall be called for trial, the Sheriff, or other officer, shall, by <em>order of the Gourt, </em>return jurymen of the bystanders, sufficient to form or complete the panel. Vet three of the jury, sworn in this case, are not named in the venire, nor does it appear from the record that they were summoned as bystanders by any order of the Court. ' \u201e</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b219-6\">The record does not state that the jurors were \u201c elected,\u201d but only that they were impanneled and sworn. The whole proceeding in impanneling the petit jury, was irregular and without the authority of law. The order of the Court for the special venire does not direct thirty-six good and lawful men of the county of Liberty to be summoned as jury, but \u201c thirty-six persons.\u201d (1 Baldwin, p. 78.) The venire issued by the Clerk does not state the case for the trial of which they were summoned, (6 Binney,) as, The State of Texas vs. Joseph White, indictment for murder ; but states, \u201c in a case wherein the State \u2022of Texas is plaintiff and Joseph White defendant.\u201d The Sheriff\u2019s return does not show that the persons summoned were good and lawful men of the county of Liberty, but that he summoned \u201c the following jurors.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b219-7\">These may be said to be irregularities, and waived by the party; of no consequence\u2014that they do not affect the merits of the case. Where life hangs on the issue, do irregularities enter into and form any part of the \u201c due course of the law of the land ?\"</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b220-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>III.\u2014As to the third point taken, upon the allowance of the challenge of jurors for cause, I refer to the Opinion of Justice Gibson in the case of Com. vs. Lesher, 17 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 160.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b220-5\">IY.\u2014As to the fourth position\u2014test the charge by the language of the statute, and it cannot be sustained.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b220-6\">Y.\u2014As to the fifth point suggested. In judgments or sentences of death in capital cases, our statute prescribes the penalty, but the Common Law furnishes the form of the judgment or sentence. The form is substance in such cases, and is in the line of safe precedents not to be departed from. (Chitty, C. L. 720 ; 4 Black. Com., Appendix.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b220-7\">The judgment does not purport to give the language of the Judge, passing the sentence in person then and there in the presence of the prisoner. The judgment is given by the Clerk for the Court. It is given, not because the accused had been, indicted, arraigned, plead and been found guilty, and because he had nothing to say why sentence of death should not be passed against him ; but because the Court overruled a motion for a new trial, &amp;c. The record must not state one reason or cause for the judgment, when that reason is insufficient to sustain the judgment. For in this matter, nothing can be taken by intendment; and we are not at liberty to say the record intended to refer the conviction to the verdict of the jury and the anterior proceedings in the trial. Among many other substantial defects, the record does not show that the accused was asked by the Judge, before the judgment was entered by the Clerk, (I will not say pronounced by the Court,) \u201c whether he had any thing to say why sentence of death should not be pronounced against him ?\u201d and that the accused \u201c had nothing further than he had said.\u201d (4 Harris, Penn. R. 133 ; 6 Barr, 384.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b220-8\">I cannot conclude presenting this case in more forcible language, than that of a learned Judge, (6th Barr, 384.) \u201cWe \u201c may safely presume as individuals, that in tranquil times and \u201c in an enlightened city, the conduct of the trial was all right; \u201c but, <em>as a Gourt, </em>we can look <em>only to the record; </em>for this re- \u201c cord and judgment will be recorded for a precedent for other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>\u201c times ; and if we let in presumptions to supply omissions \u201c and defects in records, it will by and by be deemed scarcely \u201c necessary to show by the record any of the important safe- \u201c guards of a trial by jury ; and the Common Law forms, stout- \u201c ly asserted as a shield of liberty, by the Hampdens, Russels <em>\u201c </em>and Sidneys of other days, will lose their value. But the \u201c forms are not merely a shield against despotism of kings ; for \u201c there is occasionally a despotism in all countries, a despotism \u201c whose terrible voice is heard in tumults and excitements\u2014in <em>\u201c </em>the rage of unrestrained and impetuous will. It is then that \u201c the stern and inflexible rules of the <em>Common Lato trial by \u201c jury </em>will best prove their importance and value. In the last \u201c ten or twenty years, there have been <em>mode trials and bloody \u201c executions, </em>without the forms of law in these States, which \u201c would have been deemed impossible in the primitive days of \u201c the Republic.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b221-5\"><em>H.

It has never been our practice to put such an order on the record.\u2014 But if this exception were good at all, it ought to have been taken at the time the persons in question were presented as jurors, and then it could have been obviated. Not liavingbeen taken before or at the trial, or at any time in the Court below, it certainly comes too late on appeal, and the presumption must be indulged here that the matter was. rightly done at the proper time. It would have come too late even after verdict, in the District Court. (Rex. v. Hunt, 4 Barn, and Ald. 430 ; Amherst v. Hadley, 1 Pick. R. 38 ; People v. Ransom, 7 Wend. R. 417 ; Cole v. Perry, 6 Cow. R. 584.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b221-7\">But the recital of the judgment entry, in the District Court, \u201c that the jury was of good and lawful men, <em>duly impanueled C </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>Ac., is a sufficient answer to this, and all other objections to that body, not reserved by bill of exceptions, or in some other mode of exception.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b222-5\">II. As to the right of the jury to find the verdict of \u201c guilty of murder <em>in the first degree,\u201d </em>upon this indictment, a conclusive answer to the objection is to be found in the Opinion of this Court in the ease of Gherke v. The State, 13 Tex. R. 568, in which the indictment was in precisely the same form with this.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b222-6\">III. As to the correctness of the ruling below, in holding \u201c conscientious scruples against finding a verdict of guilty in a case in which the punishment is capital,\u201d a sufficient ground of challenge for cause to persons offered as jurors, it seems to be so well settled on authority as not to admit of further discussion. (Whart. Am. Crim. Law, 857; Com. v. Lesher, 17 Serg. and R. 155 ; People v. Damon, 13 Wend. 351 : Jones v. The State, 2 Blackf. 475.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b222-7\">Lipscomb, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AjNl\">The appellant was tried and convicted of murder in the first degree, and a motion for a new trial and arrest of judgment was overruled, and judgment awarded ; but the prisoner having appealed to this Court, the time of execution was not fixed. Several grounds have been taken in this Court, by the appellant\u2019s counsel, on which a. reversal of the judgment is claimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">The first, the supposed defect in the indictment, was well argued by counsel in the case of Gehrk\u00e9 v. The State, at the last Term, (13 Tex. R. 568 ;) and after mature consideration, the indictment was held to be good and sufficient, without following the precise words of the statute, \u201c premeditated or deliberate.\u201d We regarded malice express, as the gist of the of-fence of murder in the first degree, and that it had been premeditatedly or deliberately done, as the evidence or indicia of that malice. The charge in the indictment against the appellant, is, \u201c feloniously, wilfully, premeditatedly and of his malice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>aforethought,\u201d omitting the word in the statute, \u201c deliberate.\u201d We are satisfied with the decision on this question, made at the last Term, and we will not alter or modify it in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">The objection to the writ of venire facias, and to the Sheriff's return thereon, is not believed to be supported by the record, and will not be noticed.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">The objection, that three of the jurors, who passed upon the guilt of the prisoner, do not appear to have been summoned on the venire, nor do their names appear thereon, cannot be taken for the first time in this Court. The objection should have been made, when called, and offered to the prisoner.\u2014 The jury was sworn, and no objection made. It is most probable, that they were called after the venire had been exhausted, which accounts for their names not appearing on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">The only objection, believed to be entitled to any consideration, is the rejection of the persons offered as jurors, upon the ground of their having conscientious scruples against capital punishment. On this question there has been some conflict in the opinions of eminent jurists. It would seem, however, that on principle it would be difficult to make such persons good, impartial and indifferent jurors: and to put men on the jury, whose conscientious scruples would override their oath, \u2018would result inevitably in either a mistrial or an acquittal, irrespective of the facts proven. The religious scruples of every citizen are entitled to respect, and no man should be placed in a position where he is required to do violence to his conscience, or to commit perjury, or to disregard the obligation of an oath. If placed in that position, against his will, he would he apt to regard his own conscientious scruples of higher obligation than his oath. A man's sincere, conscientious scruples are entitled to great indulgence, and it is for his protection, the question is asked. There is better reason for asking it and for making it a sufficient ground for setting him. aside as not a competent juror, than for asking the juror, when offered, if he had formed and expressed an opinion of the guilt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>or innocence of the accused, or if he had any prejudice against him. In these cases, the very questions would imply a charge against the juror, of the impropriety of having so formed an opinion, or of having harbored and nourished in his heart ill will towards his fellow man; and some eminent jurists have therefore concluded that a juror should not be required to respond to such enquiries. We cannot believe that it is improper to ask the juror if he entertains such scruples, and if answered in the affirmative, he ought to be set aside as not a good juror.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">We find nothing in the record in this case, to authorise us to reverse the judgment; it is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">Our attention has again been directed to the record in this case, and there is but one point presented, not noticed in the above Opinion, that we regard as requiring of us any notice. It is insisted by the counsel for the appellant, that it does not appear, that he had been asked in the Court below, whether he had anything to say, why sentence should not be passed on him ? In trials at common law, for murder, on conviction, the prisoner had no right to an appeal. Under our laws an appeal is made a matter of right, and where an appeal is claimed, the Court does not pass sentence ; the judgment is entered on the verdict, but no sentence is passed until after the appeal has been tried in this Court, and certified to the Court below. If affirmed, the Court, at its first Term thereafter, passes sentence and awards the execution thereof. The prisoner will then be asked if he has anything to say why sentence should not be passed on him. He has had the benefit of a motion in arrest of judgment and fop a new trial, before the case came into this Court, and this is all that of right he could claim, before the appeal was taken. We se$ no legal ground for a different judgment, than the one entered in accordance with our original Opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
