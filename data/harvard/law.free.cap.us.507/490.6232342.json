Most of the funds at issue are unclaimed securities distributions held by intermediary banks, brokers, and depositories for beneficial owners who cannot be identified or located. The Special Master proposed awarding the right to escheat such funds to the State in which the principal executive offices of the securities issuer are located. Adhering to the rules announced in <em>Texas </em>v. <em>New Jersey, </em>379 U. S. 674 (1965), and <em>Pennsylvania </em>v. <em>New York, </em>407 U. S. 206 (1972), we hold that the State in which the intermediary is incorporated has the right to escheat funds belonging to beneficial owners who cannot be identified or located.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"Aes\">This case involves unclaimed dividends, interest, and other distributions made by issuers of securities. Such payments are often channeled through financial intermediaries such as banks, brokers, and depositories before they reach their beneficial owners. By arrangement with the beneficial owners, these intermediaries frequently hold securities in their own names rather than in the names of the beneficial owners; as \u201crecord owners,\u201d the intermediaries are fully entitled to receive distributions based on those securities.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This practice of holding securities in \u201cnominee name\u201d or \u201cstreet name\u201d facilitates the offering of customized financial services such as cash management accounts,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> brokerage margin accounts,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> discretionary trusts,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and dividend reinvestment programs.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Street name accounts also permit changes in beneficial ownership to be effected through book entries rather than the unwieldy physical transfer of securities certificates. See Brown, The Shareholder Communication Rules and the Securities and Exchange Commission: An Exercise in Regulatory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>Utility or Futility?, 13 J. Corp. L. 683, 688-691 (1988). The economies of scale attained in the modern financial services industry are epitomized by the securities depository, a large institution that holds only the accounts of \u201cparticipant\u201d brokers and banks and serves as a clearinghouse for its participants\u2019 securities transactions. Because a depository retains record ownership of securities, it effectively \u201cimmobilizes\u201d the certificates in its possession by allowing its participants to trade securities without the physical transfer of certificates. Most of the equity securities traded on the New York Stock Exchange are immobilized in this fashion. See App. to Report of the Special Master B-2. Cf. Securities and Exchange Commission, Division of Market Regulation, Progress and Prospects: Depository Immobilization of Securities and Use of Book-Entry Systems 4 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">The intermediaries are unable to distribute a small portion of the securities to their beneficial owners.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> When an intermediary claims no property interest in funds so held, they become escheatable.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Between 1985 and 1989, New York es-cheated $360 million in funds of abandoned securities held for more than three years by intermediaries doing business in New York, without regard to the last known address of the beneficial owner or the intermediary\u2019s State of incorporation. N. Y. Aband. Prop. Law \u00a7 511 (McKinney 1991). See Report of Special Master 10, n. 9. Alleging that certain of these securities were wrongfully escheated, Delaware sought leave in 1988 to initiate an original action in this Court against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>New York. We granted leave to file the complaint, 486 U. S. 1030 (1988), and appointed a Special Master, 488 U. S. 990 (1988). We granted Texas\u2019 motion to file a complaint as an intervening plaintiff, 489 U. S. 1005 (1989), and every State not already a party to this proceeding and the District of Columbia sought leave to intervene.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-8\">On January 28, 1992, the Master filed his report and recommendation. Both Delaware and New York have lodged exceptions to the report, as have four other parties whose motions for leave to intervene have not been granted by this Court.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We now sustain two of Delaware\u2019s exceptions in their entirety, one of Delaware\u2019s exceptions in part, and one of New York\u2019s exceptions. We also grant all pending motions to intervene and to file briefs as <em>amici curiae, </em>overrule all exceptions not sustained in this opinion, and remand for further proceedings before the Master.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-9\">HH H \u2014 f</p>\n<p id=\"b581-3\">States as sovereigns may take custody of or assume title to abandoned personal property as <em>bona vacantia, </em>a process commonly (though somewhat erroneously) called escheat.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See, <em>e. g., Christianson </em>v. <em>King County, </em>239 U. S. 356, 365-366 (1915); <em>Cunnius </em>v. <em>Reading School Dist., </em>198 U. S. 458, 469-476 (1905); <em>Hamilton </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>161 U. S. 256, 263-264 (1896). No serious controversy can arise between States seeking to escheat \u201ctangible property, real or personal,\u201d for \u201cit has always been the unquestioned rule in all jurisdictions that only the State in which the property is located may es-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>cheat.\u201d <em>Texas </em>v. <em>New Jersey, </em>379 U. S., at 677. On the other hand, intangible property \u201cis not physical matter which can be located on a map,\u201d <em>ibid., </em>and frequently no single State can claim an uncontested right to escheat such property.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">In <em>Texas </em>v. <em>New Jersey, </em>we discharged \u201cour responsibility in the exercise of our original jurisdiction\u201d to resolve escheat disputes that \u201cthe States separately are without constitutional power ... to settle.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark><em> </em>We adopted two rules intended to \u201csettle the question of which State will be allowed to escheat [abandoned] intangible property.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>\u201c[SJince a debt is property of the creditor, not of the debtor,\u201d we reasoned, \u201cfairness among the States requires that the right and power to escheat the debt should be accorded to the State of the creditor\u2019s last known address as shown by the debtor\u2019s books and records.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 680-681 (footnote omitted). This primary rule had the virtue of \u201cinvolving] a factual issue simple and easy to resolve,\u201d made even simpler by the Court\u2019s resort to \u201clast known address, rather than technical legal concepts of residence and domicile.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 681. It also achieved rough equity in that it \u201ctend[ed] to distribute escheats among the States in the proportion of the commercial activities of their residents.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>We recognized, however, that the primary rule could not resolve escheat claims over \u201cproperty owed persons (1) as to whom there is no record of any address at all, or (2) whose last known address is in a State which does not provide for es-cheat of the property owed them.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 682. For these situations, we adopted a secondary rule awarding the right to escheat to the debtor\u2019s \u201cState of corporate domicile,\u201d subject to the claims of the State with \u201ca superior right to es-cheat\u201d under the primary rule. <em>Ibid. </em>We characterized the <em>Texas </em>scheme as \u201cthe fairest, . . . easy to apply, and in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>long run ... the most generally acceptable to all the States.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 683.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">We reaffirmed <em>Texas </em>in <em>Pennsylvania </em>v. <em>New York, </em>407 U. S. 206 (1972). <em>Texas </em>had involved the relatively simple case of a debtor that \u201cdisclaimed any interest\u201d in \u201cvarious small debts . . . owed to . . . small creditors who ha[d] never appeared to collect them.\u201d <em>Texas, supra, </em>at 676, 675. In <em>Pennsylvania, </em>by contrast, the Western Union Company held proceeds left unclaimed because Western Union was unable to locate the payee of a money order or to make a refund to the sender or because drafts issued by Western Union were not negotiated. See 407 U. S., at 208-209; <em>Western Union Telegraph Co. </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania, </em>368 U. S. 71, 72-73 (1961). Because Western Union did not \u201cregularly record the addresses of its money order creditors,\u201d the primary rule would rarely apply, and the debtor\u2019s State of incorporation\u2014 Western Union\u2019s \u201ccorporate domicile\u201d \u2014 would \u201creceive a much larger share of the unclaimed funds\u201d under the secondary rule. <em>Pennsylvania, </em>407 U. S., at 214. In response to this perceived injustice, other States advocated a rule allowing the State of \u201cthe place of purchase\u201d to escheat under the primary rule. We nevertheless adhered to our decision in <em>Texas. </em>The \u201conly arguable\u201d difference between money orders and the obligations at issue in <em>Texas </em>lay in the fact that money orders \u201cinvolve a higher percentage of unknown addresses.\u201d 407 U. S., at 214. We reasoned that neither this distinction nor the resulting \u201clikelihood of a \u2018windfall\u2019 \u201d for the debtor\u2019s State of incorporation would justify the \u201ccarving out [of an] exception to the <em>Texas </em>rule.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">We therefore resolve disputes among States over the right to escheat intangible personal property in the following three steps. First, we must determine the precise debtor-creditor relationship as defined by the law that creates the property at issue. Second, because the property interest in any debt belongs to the creditor rather than the debtor, the primary rule gives the first opportunity to escheat to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>State of \u201cthe creditor\u2019s last known address as shown by the debtor\u2019s books and records.\u201d <em>Texas, supra, </em>at 680-681. Finally, if the primary rule fails because the debtor\u2019s records disclose no address for a creditor or because the creditor\u2019s last known address is in a State whose laws do not provide for escheat, the secondary rule awards the right to escheat to the State in which the debtor is incorporated. These rules arise from our \u201cauthority and duty to determine for [ourselves] all questions that pertain\u201d to a controversy between States, <em>Kentucky </em>v. <em>Indiana, </em>281 U. S. 163, 176 (1930), and no State may supersede them by purporting to prescribe a different priority under state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-9\">I<em>II</em></p>\n<p id=\"b584-3\">None of the parties contests the primary rule or the Master\u2019s recommendation that \u201cwhere the state of domicile of an unbeatable entitled recipient is known, through finding a last known address, that state may take custody of the unclaimed distributions.\u201d Report of Special Master 56-57 (footnote omitted).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The bulk of the abandoned distributions at issue, however, cannot be traced to any identifiable beneficial owner, much less one with a last known address. These funds thus fall out of the primary rule and into the secondary rule. Consequently, under <em>Texas </em>and <em>Pennsylvania, </em>the debtor\u2019s State of incorporation should be entitled to escheat this unclaimed property. The Master\u2019s report concludes, first, that the issuer of securities is the relevant \u201cdebtor\u201d and, second, that the State in which the debtor\u2019s \u201cprincipal executive offices\u201d are located should be considered the debt- or\u2019s State. We reject both of these recommendations.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">\u201c[Wjhere the entitled recipient\u2019s domicile is undeterminable (no last known address), but the state of domicile of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>originator of the distribution is known,\u201d the Master recommended that the originator\u2019s State be awarded the right to escheat, \u201cwhether or not the originator would have been entitled to receive the funds back in its own right.\u201d Report of Special Master 57. Because he construed the use of the terms \u201cdebtor\u201d and \u201ccreditor\u201d in <em>Texas </em>and <em>Pennsylvania </em>as a merely \u201cdescriptive ... attempt to identify the relevant parties\u201d rather than \u201cprescriptive legal commands,\u201d Report of Special Master 29, the Master defined \u201cdebtor\u201d as \u201cthe last owner of the funds, in the sense of the last person who had a claim to the funds as an asset that would appropriately be reflected in the net worth of the entity in question,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 32. In its first exception, Delaware argues that \u201cthe Report\u2019s recommendation in this regard does not comport with the ordinary meaning of the words \u2018debtor\u2019 and \u2018creditor,\u2019 is inconsistent with universally-accepted state and common law and with the principles underlying the <em>Texas </em>rule, and changes the law in an area where the law should be settled.\u201d Exceptions and Brief for Plaintiff Delaware E-4. Delaware also objects to the Master\u2019s failure to \u201cascrib[e] . . . legal relevance to [intermediaries\u2019] status as record security holders,\u201d a \u201cfundamental factual error\u201d that effectively treats record owners \u201cas if they were paying agents.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at E-5. New York\u2019s first exception likewise objects to the Master\u2019s use of \u201cthe term \u2018debtor\u2019 as \u2018shorthand\u2019 to identify parties with \u2018debtor attributes\u2019 rather than the obligor of the debt.\u201d Exceptions of Defendant New York 52. We agree with both States and sustain their exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">We have not relied on legal definitions of \u201ccreditor\u201d and \u201cdebtor\u201d merely for descriptive convenience. Rather, we have grounded the concepts of \u201ccreditor\u201d and \u201cdebtor\u201d in the positive law that gives rise to the property at issue. In framing a State\u2019s power of escheat, we must first look to the law that creates property and binds persons to honor property rights. \u201cProperty interests, of course, are not created by the Constitution,\u201d but rather \u201cby existing rules or under<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>standings that stem from an independent source such as state law.\u201d <em>Board of Regents of State Colleges </em>v. <em>Roth, </em>408 U. S. 564, 577 (1972). Accord, <em>e. g., Bishop </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>426 U. S. 341, 344-347 (1976); <em>Paul </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>424 U. S. 693, 710-712 (1976). See also <em>Barnhill </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>503 U. S. 393, 398 (1992) (\u201cIn the absence of any controlling federal law, \u2018property\u2019 and \u2018interests in property\u2019 are creatures of state law\u201d). Furthermore, law that creates property necessarily defines the legal relationships under which certain parties (\u201cdebtors\u201d) must discharge obligations to others (\u201ccreditors\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">To define \u201cdebtor\u201d as \u201cthe last person who ha[s] a claim to the funds as an asset that would appropriately be reflected in [his] net worth,\u201d Report of Special Master 32, would convert a term rich with prescriptive legal content into little more than a description of bookkeeping phenomena. Funds held by a debtor become subject to escheat because the debtor has no interest in the funds \u2014 precisely the opposite of having \u201ca claim to the funds as an asset.\u201d We have recognized as much in cases upholding a State\u2019s power to escheat neglected bank deposits. Charters, bylaws, and contracts of deposit do not give a bank the right to retain abandoned deposits, and a law requiring the delivery of such deposits to the State affects no property interest belonging to the bank. <em>Security Savings Bank </em>v. <em>California, </em>263 U. S. 282, 285-286 (1923); <em>Provident Institution for Savings </em>v. <em>Malone, </em>221 U. S. 660, 665-666 (1911). Thus, \u201cdeposits are <em>debtor obligations </em>of the bank,\u201d and a State may \u201cprotect the interests of depositors\u201d as creditors by assuming custody over accounts \u201cinactive so long as to be presumptively abandoned. \u201d <em>Anderson Nat. Bank </em>v. <em>Luckett, </em>321 U. S. 233, 241 (1944) (emphasis added). Such \u201cdisposition of abandoned property is a function of the state,\u201d a sovereign \u201cexercise of a regulatory power\u201d over property and the private legal obligations inherent in property. <em>Standard Oil Co. </em>v. <em>New Jersey, </em>341 U. S. 428, 436 (1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b587-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>Our rules regarding interstate disputes over competing es-cheat claims cannot be severed from the law that creates the underlying creditor-debtor relationships. In <em>Texas </em>and <em>Pennsylvania, </em>our examination of the holder\u2019s legal obligations not only defined the escheatable property at issue but also carefully identified the relevant \u201cdebtors\u201d and \u201ccreditors.\u201d See <em>Texas, </em>379 U. S., at 675-676, n. 4; <em>Pennsylvania, </em>407 U. S., at 208-209, 213. In <em>Pennsylvania, </em>we noted that Western Union was a \u201cdebtor\u201d insofar as it owed contractual duties to two separate creditors. Western Union was obligated not merely to deliver a negotiable draft to the sender\u2019s payee; if Western Union could not locate the payee or if the payee failed to claim his money order, the company was bound to make a refund to the sender. <em>Id., </em>at 208-209. Correspondingly, we recognized that the relevant \u201ccreditor\u201d might be either a payee or a sender: \u201cthe payee of an unpaid draft, the sender of a money order entitled to a refund,\u201d or a payee or sender \u201cwhose claim has been underpaid through error.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 213 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">Moreover, the rules developed in <em>Texas </em>and <em>Pennsylvania </em>reflect the traditional view of escheat as an exercise of sovereignty over persons and property owned by persons. The primary rule flowed from the common-law \u201cconcept of <em>\u2018mobi-lia sequuntur personam,\u2019 </em>according to which intangible personal property is found at the domicile of its owner.\u201d <em>Texas, supra, </em>at 680, n. 10. Accord, <em>Pennsylvania, supra, </em>at 217-218 (Powell, J., dissenting). See also <em>Blodgett </em>v. <em>Silberman, </em>277 U. S. 1, 10 (1928) (\u201c[I]ntangible personalty has ... a <em>situs </em>at the domicil of the owner\u201d). In recognizing that \u201ca debt is property of the creditor,\u201d <em>Texas, supra, </em>at 680, the primary rule permits the escheating State to protect the interest of a creditor last known to have resided there. Reasoning that \u201cdebts owed by\u201d a holder of unclaimed funds \u201care not property to it, but rather a liability,\u201d we concluded that \u201cit would be strange to convert a liability into an asset when the State decides to escheat.\u201d 379 U. S., at 680. Cognizant of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>creditor\u2019s status as owner of intangible personal property, we awarded the primary right to escheat to the creditor\u2019s State. Conversely, when a creditor\u2019s last known address cannot be determined or the laws of the creditor\u2019s State do not provide for escheat, the secondary rule protects the interests of the debtor\u2019s State as sovereign over the remaining party to the underlying transaction. Unless we define the terms \u201ccreditor\u201d and \u201cdebtor\u201d according to positive law, we might \u201cpermit intangible property rights to be cut off or adversely affected by state action ... in a forum having no continuing relationship to any of the parties to the proceedings.\u201d <em>Pennsylvania, supra, </em>at 213 (internal quotation marks omitted). Cf. <em>Connecticut Mut. Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>333 U. S. 541, 549-550 (1948) (upholding New York\u2019s escheat of unclaimed insurance benefits only \u201cas to policies issued for delivery in New York upon the lives of persons then resident therein where the insured continues to be a resident and the beneficiary is a resident at. . . maturity\u201d). <em>Texas </em>and <em>Pennsylvania </em>avoided this conundrum by resolving escheat disputes according to the law that creates debtor-creditor relationships; only a State with a clear connection to the creditor or the debtor may escheat. Because the Master failed to identify the relevant \u201ccreditors\u201d and \u201cdebtors\u201d by reference to that law, we now perform this task.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">We hold that intermediaries who hold unclaimed securities distributions in their own name are the relevant \u201cdebtors\u201d under the secondary rule of <em>Texas </em>and <em>Pennsylvania. </em>From an issuer\u2019s perspective, the only creditors are registered shareholders, those whose names appear on the issuer\u2019s records. Issuers cannot be considered debtors once they pay dividends, interest, or other distributions to record owners; payment to a record owner discharges all of an issuer\u2019s obligations. Under \u00a7 8-207(1) of the Uniform Commercial Code, which is the law of all 50 States and the District of Columbia, \u201cthe issuer ... may treat the registered owner as the person exclusively ... to exercise all the rights and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>powers of an owner.\u201d Payment to an intermediary that is the record owner of securities extinguishes any liability the issuer might have to the beneficial owner. U. C. C. \u00a7 8-207, comment 1, 2C U. L. A. 341 (1991). The Master acknowledged as much, see Report of Special Master 25, and none of the parties contends otherwise. Instead, an intermediary serving as the record owner of securities is the \u201cdebtor\u201d insofar as the intermediary has a contractual duty to transmit distributions to the beneficial owner. Unlike an issuer,which discharges all liabilities upon payment to a record owner, an intermediary remains liable should a \u201clost\u201d beneficial owner reappear to collect distributions due under a contract with the intermediary. The Master thus erred in equating intermediary banks, brokers, and depositories with the issuers\u2019 paying agents, who owe no duty to beneficial owners but rather bear the contractual obligation to \u201creturn . . . unclaimed distributions to the issuer after a certain period of time.\u201d App. to Report of Special Master B-6. Intermediaries who hold securities in street name or nominee name are the relevant \u201cdebtors\u201d because they alone, and not the issuers, are legally obligated to deliver unclaimed securities distributions to the beneficial owners.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">The Master\u2019s recommended disposition of this case rested on a second major premise: his proposal to locate a corporate debtor in \u201cthe jurisdiction of the entity\u2019s principal domestic executive offices rather than the state of incorporation.\u201d Report of Special Master 49 (footnote omitted). In <em>Texas </em>and <em>Pennsylvania, </em>however, we explicitly granted the right to escheat under the secondary rule to the State in which the debtor was incorporated. <em>Texas, supra, </em>at 682; <em>Pennsylvania, supra, </em>at 210-211, 212, 223-224. By the Master\u2019s own admission, relying on the location of a debtor\u2019s principal executive offices \u201cchange[s] [this Court\u2019s] longstanding practice.\u201d Report of Special Master 50. The Master proposed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>this innovation <em>sua sponte; </em>no party sought this alteration of our settled law. Delaware excepts to this \u201c[d]epart[ure] from the rule of corporate domicile\u201d as \u201cinconsistent not only with this Court\u2019s precedents, but with fundamental principles of jurisprudence defining the relationship between the sovereign and its corporate citizens.\u201d Exceptions and Brief for Plaintiff Delaware E-4 to E-5. Finding that the \u201cheavy burden\u201d that attends a request \u201cto reconsider not one but two prior decisions\u201d has not been borne, <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Armco Steel Corp., </em>446 U. S. 740, 749 (1980), we sustain Delaware\u2019s exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">In <em>Texas, </em>we considered and rejected a proposal to award the <em>primary </em>right to escheat to the State \u201cwhere [the debt- or\u2019s] principal offices are located.\u201d 379 U. S., at 680. Although we recognized that \u201cthis State is probably foremost in giving the benefits of its economy and laws to the company whose business activities made the intangible property come into existence,\u201d we rejected the rule because its application \u201cwould raise in every case the sometimes difficult question of where a company\u2019s \u2018main office\u2019 or \u2018principal place of business\u2019 or whatever it might be designated is located.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Even when we formulated the <em>secondary </em>rule, we looked instead to the debtor\u2019s State of incorporation. <em>Id., </em>at 682. As in <em>Texas, </em>we find that determining the State of incorporation is the most efficient way to locate a corporate debtor. Exclusive reliance on incorporation permits the disposition of claims under the secondary rule upon the taking of judicial notice. Although \u201ca general inquiry into where the principal executive office is located [may] see[m] neither burdensome [n]or complex,\u201d Report of Special Master 49, we cannot embrace a \u201crule leaving so much for decision on a case-by-case basis,\u201d <em>Texas, supra, </em>at 680. The mere introduction of any factual controversy over the location of a debtor\u2019s principal executive offices needlessly complicates an inquiry made irreducibly simple by <em>Texas\u2019 </em>adoption of a test based on the State of incorporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>Even if we were to endorse the Master\u2019s redefinition of a debtor\u2019s location, we doubt that his proposal could fulfill its promise \u201cto distribute the funds [more] fairly among the various jurisdictions.\u201d Report of Special Master 50. The Master sought to counteract the inequity he perceived in the happenstance that \u201cthe larger, publicly-traded, enterprises that generate the lion\u2019s share of the securities distributions . . . are by any standard disproportionately incorporated in one state.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 47. His \u201cprincipal executive offices\u201d initiative, however, cannot survive independent of his erroneous decision to treat the issuers as the relevant \u201cdebtors.\u201d Because we have already decided that the intermediaries are the proper debtors under the secondary rule, this change would simply transfer the bulk of the disputed funds from Delaware, where many intermediaries are incorporated, to New York, where many intermediaries have located their principal executive offices. A company\u2019s arguably arbitr\u00e1is-decisi\u00f3n to incorporate in one State bears no less on its business activities than its officers\u2019 equally arbitrary decision to locate their principal executive offices in another State. It must be remembered that we refer to a debtor\u2019s State of incorporation only when the creditor\u2019s last address is unknown or when the creditor\u2019s State does not provide for es-cheat. When the creditor\u2019s State cannot assert its predominant interest, we detect no inequity in rewarding a State whose laws prove more attractive to firms that wish to incorporate.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">Precedent, efficiency, and equity all dictate the rejection of the Master\u2019s \u201cprincipal executive offices\u201d proposal. We accordingly adhere to <em>Texas </em>and <em>Pennsylvania </em>and award the right to escheat under the secondary rule to the State in which the debtor is incorporated.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">\n<em>&gt;</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b591-3\">We turn, finally, to New York s contention that many of the disputed funds need not be escheated under the second<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>ary rule at all. New York concedes that \u201cthe creditors of unclaimed distributions\u201d held by depositories and custodian banks \u201care always unknown.\u201d Exceptions of Defendant New York 81. It argues, however, that \u201creconstruction]\u201d of \u201cthe debtor <em>brokers\u2019 </em>transactions\u201d will lead to \u201ccreditor brokers that purchased the underlying securities and were underpaid the distributions.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 80 (emphasis added). Because \u201cthe amount of time and resources that would be required to reconstruct the overpayment transactions would be very considerable,\u201d however, New York \u201chas suggested the use of statistical sampling to prove that virtually all of the creditor brokers and banks recorded on the books of debtor brokers in New York have New York addresses.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">We overrule New York\u2019s exception. As an initial matter, New York\u2019s proposal rests on the dubious supposition that the relevant \u201ccreditors\u201d under the primary rule are other brokers. We have already held that \u201ccreditors\u201d are the parties to whom the intermediaries ,are contractually obligated to deliver unclaimed securities distributions. Accordingly, to the extent that beneficial owners are the relevant \u201ccreditors,\u201d New York\u2019s exception is inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">Even if we indulge New York\u2019s premise that most creditors of New York brokers are in fact other New York brokers, the exception must fail. As the Master correctly observed: \u201c[N]othing in the Court\u2019s jurisprudence . . . suggests] that New York can prevail by making a statistical showing that \u2018most\u2019 [creditor-brokers\u2019] addresses are in New York.\u201d Report of Special Master 67. In <em>Pennsylvania, </em>we rejected a proposal practically identical to New York\u2019s. In that case, because Western Union\u2019s records frequently did not disclose a creditor\u2019s identity or last known address, the debtor\u2019s State of incorporation stood to \u201creceive a much larger share of the unclaimed funds\u201d under the secondary rule. 407 U. S., at 214. The plaintiff States urged us to define the creditor\u2019s residence according to a \u201cpresumption <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>based on the place of purchase.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Like New York\u2019s proposal, the rule advocated in <em>Pennsylvania </em>would use a statistical surrogate instead of the debtor\u2019s records to locate the last known addresses of creditors. That much is clear from the <em>Pennsylvania </em>dissent\u2019s description of the rejected rule as \u201ca reasonable approximation.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 221 (opinion of Powell, J.). New York may object to the cost and difficulty of culling creditors\u2019 last known addresses from brokers\u2019 records,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> but in <em>Pennsylvania, </em>we expressly refused \u201cto vary the application of the [primary] rule according to the adequacy of the debtor\u2019s records.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 215. And we decline to do so here.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-4\">Despite our refusal to adopt New York\u2019s proposal for statistical analysis of creditors\u2019 addresses under the primary rule, we decline Delaware\u2019s invitation to enter judgment against New York on the basis of the Master\u2019s findings. Exceptions and Brief for Plaintiff Delaware 85. On remand, if New York can establish by reference to debtors\u2019 records that the creditors who were owed particular securities distributions had last known addresses in New York, New York\u2019s right to escheat under the primary rule will supersede Delaware\u2019s right under the secondary rule. As we noted in <em>Texas, </em>\u201cthe State of corporate domicile should be allowed to ... retai[n] the property for itself only until some other State comes forward with proof that it has a superior right to es-cheat.\u201d 379 U. S., at 682. Accord, <em>Pennsylvania, </em>407 U. S., at 210-211. If New York or any other claimant State fails to offer such proof on a transaction-by-transaction basis or to provide some other proper mechanism for ascertaining creditors\u2019 last known addresses, the creditor\u2019s State will not prevail under the primary rule, and the secondary rule will control. <em>Id., </em>at 215.</p>\n<p id=\"AW-\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>V</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">Only by adhering to our precedent can we resolve escheat disputes between States in a fair and efficient manner. We have repeatedly declared our unwillingness \u201ceither to decide each escheat case on the basis of its particular facts or to devise new rules of law to apply to ever-developing new categories of facts.\u201d <em>Texas, swpra, </em>at 679. Accord, <em>Pennsylvania, supra, </em>at 215. To craft different rules for the novel facts of each case would generate \u201cso much uncertainty and threaten so much expensive litigation that the States might find that they would lose more in litigation expenses than they might gain in escheats.\u201d <em>Texas, supra, </em>at 679. If the States are dissatisfied with the outcome of a particular case, they may air their grievances before Congress. That body may reallocate abandoned property among the States without regard to this Court\u2019s interstate escheat rules. Congress overrode <em>Pennsylvania </em>by passing a specific statute concerning abandoned money orders and traveler\u2019s checks, \u00a7\u00a7601-603, 88 Stat. 1525,12 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a72501-2503, and it may ultimately settle this dispute through similar legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">We remand this case to the Master for further proceedings consistent with this opinion and for the preparation of an appropriate decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b579-4\"> An individual investor who opts to retain record ownership of a security will receive distributions directly from the issuer.
