It may be that there is property enough left to pay all remaining; creditors in money, as much value as was obtained in goods by the creditor alleged to have been preferred. If the transferred property were the whole of the-insolvent\u2019s property, or a considerable portion of it. (Wager <em>v. </em>Hall, 16 <em>Wall. </em>602), or a large portion of it (Toof <em>v. </em>Martin, 13 <em>Wall. </em>38), there may arise a presumption that there was a preference which calls for explanation, but the burden of proof is upon the-plaintiff to show that there was a view to a preference,, and that the transferee had reasonable cause to believe that there was a preference. To create the presumption referred to, it will be necessary to show what part or proportion of the whole stock was transferred. I am in doubt as to whether plaintiff gave enough proof, as to the fact of the transfer of the jewelry being a preference. The complaint, however, was not dismissed on this ground, but only on the ground of the insolv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>ency, and of the belief of defendant\u2019s testator as to it, and it is not necessary to decide as to the preference.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">The judgment should be reversed and new trial ordered, with costs of appeal to appellant to abide the event. .</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">Freedman and Truax, JJ., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
