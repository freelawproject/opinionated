When thereafter, one of these sureties became insolvent, it rested in the sound discretion of the court whether new security should or should not be required. The application for new security rested solely upon the fact of the insolvency of one of the sureties. The receiver, on the other hand, showed that the value of the property which came into his hands amounts to only $500, and that the remaining surety is worth $75,000. Under these circumstances the discretion of the court was well exercised in denying the application.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b558-5\"><em>Armstrong &amp; Briggs, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b558-6\">Opinion by Freedman, J.; Sedgwick, Ch.
