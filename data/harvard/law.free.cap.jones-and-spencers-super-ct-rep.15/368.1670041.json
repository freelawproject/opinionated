J., and Freedman, J.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b392-8\"><em>Decided June </em>6, 1881.</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b392-9\">Appeal from part of an order denying motion for judgment on answer as frivolous.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b392-10\"><em>Deane &amp; </em>Chamberlin, for appellant, urged:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A-u\">The plaintiff moves to dismiss this appeal, because it is taken from only a part\u2014the conditional part\u2014of the order. In answer to <em>this:\u2014First. </em>The Code (\u00a7 1800) expressly permits an appeal from a, specific part of an order. <em>Second. </em>An order denying a motion for judgment on an answer as frivolous is not appealable <em>(Code, </em>\u00a7 537).</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b392-11\">In the case of Tribune Association <em>v. </em>Smith (8 <em>J. </em>&amp; <em>S. </em>81), it was held by this court that \u20181 the part of the order appealed from could not be taken from its relation to the rest of the order, and the defendant should have appealed from the whole.\u201d In that case, however, the order, which gave leave to amend on payment of costs, was discretionary, and the leave granted was a favor, and the court had power to impose the terms. But this order was one which the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>was compelled to grant as an absolute right, and in granting to the defendant this right, it had. no power or authority to limit it in any manner, nor to couple it with any conditions whatever. Where an order i&amp; discretionary, or is granted as a matter of favor, the court may impose a condition, but where there is no discretion and no favor, and the order is granted as a matter of right, the court has no power to impose any conditions whatever (Anderson <em>v. </em>Rome, W. &amp; O. R. R., 54 <em>N. Y. </em>334, 343).</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b393-5\">Therefore, the defendant has the right to appeal, from that part of this order which, under the form of a condition, is virtually a separate and independent order, nullifying the part to which the defendant was entitled, and which the court granted.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b393-6\"><em>Samuel It. </em>Taylor, attorney, and <em>Charles C. Bull, </em>of counsel, for respondent.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b393-7\">By the Court.\u2014Sedgwick, Ch. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AMQ\">The answer in this case, after attempting to put in issue several allegations of the complaint, made, in sufficient form, a defense based upon alleged fraudulent representations of the plaintiff. The plaintiff moved for judgment on the answer as frivolous. The order-made on the motion was, that the motion be denied, on condition that the defendant servean amended answer, which should contain only that part of the original answer which alleged fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">The defendant appealed from that part of the order which constituted the so-called condition. I am of opinion that the appeal lies, because the defendant was entitled to have the motion denied unconditionally. The effect of striking out the condition will be, to .give the defendant what he is entitled to, as matter of right, and not of discretion. If it had been matter of discretion, appealing from a condition would result in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>giving as an absolute right, something that has not that character.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">It seems to be clear that the motion should have been denied, because, with the defense of fraud standing in the answer, the plaintiff was not entitled to judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">Order reversed with $10 costs, and disbursements to be taxed.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">Freedman, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
