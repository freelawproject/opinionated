The defendant not having availed itself of the privilege, <em>an appeal was taken from the judgment; </em>but the notice of appeal did not specify that the order was also-appealed from. On this ground the judgment was affirmed, with costs, the court citing Cameron <em>v. </em>Equitable Life Ins., 45 <em>N. Y. Super.

Scott, Esq., of counsel for the said defendant, in support of said demurrer, and Michael H. Cardozo, of counsel for the plaintiff, in opposition thereto,</p>\n<p id=\"b584-14\">\u201cUpon motion of Billings &amp; Cardozo, plaintiff\u2019s attorneys,</p>\n<p id=\"b584-15\">\u201cIt is ordered, that said demurrer be, and the same hereby is overruled, and that the plaintiff have judgment thereon; but with leave to the said defendant to withdraw his said demurrer and answer within twenty days, on payment of costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-16\">\u201cAnd it is hereby further ordered and directed that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>if the said defendant fails to comply with the terms hereby imposed, that final judgment in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant for the relief demanded in the complaint, be entered herein, with costs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">Upon this the following was also entered.:</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">[ <em>Title of the cause. </em>]</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">\u201cThe above entitled cause having duly come on for trial upon the issue of law raised by the demurrer of the defendant, the Hew York Cotton Exchange, at a special term of this court, held on the first Monday of January, 1881, Hon. John Sedgwick, Chief Justice, presiding, and a decision having been duly rendered on the 11th day of January, 1881, overruling said demurrer and directing that plaintiff have judgment thereon, but with leave to the said defendant, the Hew York Cotton Exchange, to withdraw its said demurrer and answer within twenty days on payment of costs, and the costs of the said plaintiff having been duly taxed at $62.41,</p>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">\u201c How, on motion of Billings <em>&amp; </em>Cardozo, plaintiff\u2019s attorneys,</p>\n<p id=\"b585-9\">\u201c It is adjudged that said demurrer of the said defendant, the Hew York Cotton Exchange, be and the same hereby is overruled; and that the plaintiff, Malcolm Campbell, as receiver of the property of Daniel W. Talcott, recover of the defendant, the Hew York Cotton Exchange, the sum of $62.41 costs, but with leave to the said defendant to withdraw its said demurrer and answer within twenty days, upon the payment of said costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-10\">\u201cDated April 21, 1881.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b585-11\">An appeal was taken by the following notice:</p>\n<p id=\"b585-12\">\u201cPlease to take notice that the defendant the Hew York Cotton Exchange hereby appeals to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>general term of this court from the judgment entered herein on the 21s D day of April, <em>1881, </em>overruling the demurrer interposed by said defendant to the complaint of the plaintiff, and from each and every part of said judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">\u20181 Dated New York, April 27th, 1881.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\"><em>Sutherland &amp; Scott, </em>for appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\"><em>Billings &amp; Qardozo, </em>for respondent.</p>\n<author id=\"b586-8\">By the Court.\u2014Freedman, J.\u2014This</author>\n<p id=\"A_k\">is an appeal from an interlocutory judgment overruling defendant\u2019s demurrer to the complaint, with costs, but with leave to withdraw the demurrer and answer upon payment of said costs. This is not a final judgment (Cameron v. The Equitable Life Assurance Society, &amp;c., 45 <em>N. Y. Super. Ct. </em>628; and 46 <em>Id. </em>84). Moreover, the judgment appealed from conforms to the order directing its <em>entry, </em>and as the notice of appeal does not ask for a review of the order, the judgment, even if it were a final one, would for that reason have to be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-9\">The judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-10\">Speir, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
