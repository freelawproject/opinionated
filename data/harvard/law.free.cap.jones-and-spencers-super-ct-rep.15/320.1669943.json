The plaintiff claims by virtue of an assignment from the original lessor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b344-12\">The following opinion was delivered by the court at special term:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b344-13\">Sedgwick, Ch. J. \u201cWhether the assignment was in trust for creditors or for defendant\u2019s personal benefit, I find no allegation in the complaint that the lease referred to was assigned by it. The complaint alleges that the firm \u201c made an assignment of all their effects to Abraham Wolf, the defendant in this action, who duly accepted the same.\u201d There is no allegation that at the time of the assignment he was in possession of the lease or the term. The complaint does state, that on February 16,1877, the assignor of plaintiff rented, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>by a written agreement, premises, &amp;c., described in the agreement, but this, at the most, is a piece of testimony creating the presumption that the lease continued in the firm\u2019s possession down to December, when the assignment was made, and the defendant is not to be concluded by a statement of a presumption in a pleading where he has not opportunity to offer testimony or plead it in defense.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b345-5\">\u201c There is no allegation that the firm was in possession of the premises described in the agreement, at the time the assignment was made, or that they transferred the actual possession to the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b345-6\">\u201c The complaint goes on to state that the defendant, \u2018as assignee, entered into and occupied the premises.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b345-7\">\u201cIt is immaterial whether he entered as assignee, unless he was in fact assignee ; moreover, his entry as assignee may have made him liable to the real holder of the term or assignor of the agreement rather than to the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b345-8\">\u201c There, therefore, seems to be no statement sufficient to show that the defendant was bound .by the covenants of the agreement. The complaint does not profess to be an action for trespass, or for use and occupation simply; since, through the defendant\u2019s occupation, there was an outstanding term under the agreement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b345-9\">\u201cAs against the pleading this must be considered the fact.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b345-10\">\u201c Demurrer sustained, with leave to amend on payment of costs.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b345-11\"><em>Stearns &amp; </em>Ames, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b345-12\"><em>McDaniel &amp; </em>Souther, attorneys, and <em>O.
