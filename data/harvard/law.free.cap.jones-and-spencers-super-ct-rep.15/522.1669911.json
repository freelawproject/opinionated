In the first case itwas void against the then existing or subsequent creditors of Halloran, and in the second against the creditors so hindered, delayed or defrauded. . . .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b546-14\">\u201cThe point that the executions offered in justification were absolute nullities, because they were issued out of the court of common pleas upon judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>nients recovered in the marine court, though transcripts of the judgments had been duly filed, cannot be sustained. There is not only statutory sanction for the course pursued, but the court of common pleas has held, in several well-consid\u00e9red cases, both under the marine court act of 1872, and the act of 1874, that in such cases the executions must issue out of the court of common pleas. Whether the court of common pleas was deprived of that jurisdiction by the act of 1875, need not be considered now, because that act was passed after the executions had been issued.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b547-5\">\u201c The admissibility of the Percy execution in mitigation, was determined on a former appeal in this case (44 <em>Super.
