The premium was made payable semi-annually, one-half in cash and one-half in a loan, with thirty days\u2019 grace. On February 9, 1877, when the thirty days\u2019 grace expired, the plaintiff did not pay the half-year\u2019s premium then due. Upon the trial plaintiff gave evidence tending to prove that on the following day, plaintiff\u2019s agent went to the company\u2019s office prepared to pay the pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>mium, and was told by an authorized agent of the \u2022company that the insured had \u201cattended to that himself.\u201d The court submitted to the jury the question whether there was a waiver of the forfeiture, and the jury found in favor of the plaintiff.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b402-4\">Arnoux, <em>Mitch &amp; </em>Woodford, attorneys, and <em>Wm.

S. </em>234); Prentice <em>v. </em>Knickerbocker Life Ins. Co. (77 <em>N. Y. </em>483); and Titus <em>v. </em>Glenns Falls Ins. Co. (81 <em>N. Y. </em>410), the plaintiff made a sufficient case to entitle her to go to the jury upon the question whether or not the company had elected to treat the policy as in force on February 10, 1877, and by such election had waived the forfeiture. If I am correct in this, no ground for reversal exists, for the question was fairly submitted to the jury and their finding should not be disturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">The judgment and order should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">Speir, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
