Thereafter the M. bank credited account of D., L. &amp; Co., and charged account of bank of E. with $5,000, and wrote to the bank of E.: \u201cWe remit $5,000 to D., L. &amp; Co., N. Y., to your credit;\u201d whereupon, bank of E. credited account of M. bank, and charged account D., L. &amp; Co., $5,000. On August 3, the M. bank made a general assignment of its property and effects to plaintiff, who duly accepted it, and on the 4th telegraphed the fact to D., L. &amp; Co., which telegram reached them on the 5th, two hours before the above inclosure containing requests for credits.

Morris (another name for \u201c Salina Bank,\u201d Kansas), were depositors with the Mast\u00edn Bank, and each of these three banks, during; all this time, was a depositor with Donnell, Lawson <em>&amp; </em>Co., bankers in the city of New York.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b347-11\">\u201c On August 3, 1878, the Mast\u00edn Bank made a general assignment of all its property and effects to Kersey Coates of Jackson county, Missouri. Coates accepted the assignment, and entered at once upon the discharge of his duties, as assignee. On August 4, Coates telegraphed to Donnell, Lawson &amp; Co. the fact of such assignment having been made, which tele<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>gram was received by the latter about 10 a. m., of August 5. There was then due from the latter to the Mast\u00edn Bank (laying out of view the validity of the claims made here by the contesting defendants) the sum of $9,786.75, as then stated by Donnell, Lawson &amp; Co. to the plaintiff\u2019s agent, but subsequently ascertained to be, with interest to such subsequent date, $10,028.89.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b348-4\">\u201c The plaintiff, as such assignee, in September, 1878, brought an action in this court against Donnell, Lawson <em>&amp; </em>Co., to recover the sum of $9,786.75, the amount then supposed to be owing by them. Donnell, Lawson '&amp; Co. made a motion in that action, for leave to pay the money into court, and to be discharged from liability on so doing, on allegations that each of the defendants, by transactions between it and the Mast\u00edn Bank prior in date to the assignment, claimed to have become owners of part of the amount owing by Donnell, Lawson <em>&amp; </em>Co. to the Mast\u00edn Bank; and that the claims of all of them exceeded the amount of such balance. That motion was granted by an order made December 9, 1878, and thereupon Donnell, Lawson &amp; Co. paid into court $10,023.89.

Donnell, Lawson &amp; Co. did not accept or act on either of these four orders or drafts ; they did not place anything to the credit of either of the parties named in these four orders or drafts. In what order of priority these four drafts or orders were drawn, does not appear, if I remember, accurately, the testimony.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b351-5\">\u201c I do not deem it important to consider the question, whether the form of the two orders, in favor of the Emporia Bank and the Salina Bank, would make them bills of exchange, if they had been delivered to these two banks, as means of enabling them to realize the amounts, in cash, or credit with Donnell, Lawson <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>&amp; Co. They never were delivered to these banks, and were not drawn with any intent that they should be so delivered.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b352-4\">\u201cThe request made by the Emporia Bank of the Mast\u00edn Bank, was to. \u2018 remit to Donnell, Lawson <em>&amp; </em>Co. five thousand dollars for our account credit.\u2019 The request made by the Salina Bank was to \u2018 remit five thousand dollars to Donnell, Lawson <em>&amp; </em>Co., New York, for our credit.\u2019 The substance of this is, 1 increase the amount of our credit with Donnell, Lawson <em>&amp; </em>Co., five thousand dollars,\u2019 and charge us the like amount.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b352-5\">\u201cOmitting from the so-called orders or drafts the words \u2018pay to the order of,\u2019 and they read in the one case, \u2018 credit the First National Bank of Emporia, Kansas, five thousand dollars.\u2019 The other as drawn reads, \u2018pay to the order of credit of Salina Bank five thousand dollars.\u2019 \u25a0 The letter accompanying each order, and to be read with it, says, \u2018 please find inclosed for the credit (of either bank as the case may be), $5,000.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b352-6\">\u201c Hence it is evident that each order and its accompanying letter consisted of private instructions from the Mast\u00edn Bank to Donnell, Lawson <em>&amp; </em>Co., and amounted to a direction or request, in each case, to give a credit to the person and to the amount named in it. These instructions were unknown, so far as the evidence shows, to either the Emporia Bank or the Salina Bank. Those banks had severally requested the Mast\u00edn Bank to. increase the credit of each with Donnell, Lawson &lt;&amp; Co., to the amount of $5,000. The Mast\u00edn Bank undertook, in its own way, to comply with this request by sending to Donnell, Lawson &amp; Co. the orders and accompanying letters, and thereupon notified.the two banks that they had remitted. Of course, when the Mast\u00edn Bank so wrote it had not, as matter of fact, in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>creased the credit of either bank with Donnell, Lawson &amp; Co., and that fact was known to the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b353-4\">\u201c Donnell, Lawson &amp; Co. knew nothing about the requests made of the Mast\u00edn Bank, or of its reply to such requests, and heard nothing of the matter until August 5, and then refused to give the credit, so that, as matter of fact, neither bank got any credit with Donnell, Lawson &amp; Co., by reason of the transaction.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b353-5\">\u201cHence, it is clear that these two banks have no right to any part of this fund, unless the transaction between them and the Mast\u00edn Bank amounts to, or operates as an equitable assignment of the debt owing by Donnell, Lawson &amp; Co. to the Mast\u00edn Bank on August 1, 1878. The moneys received by Donnell, Lawson &amp;Co., from, or on account of the Mast\u00edn Bank, and credited to it on account, did not come to their possession clothed with any trust; the money so received by them, on the receipt thereof, became their moneys, and it was their duty to pay the drafts or orders drawn on them by the' Mast\u00edn Bank, as they might be presented, to the extent of their indebtedness at that time to the Mast\u00edn Bank.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b353-6\">\u201c If, in answer to the requests to remit, the- Mast\u00edn Bank had drawn and sent to each of these banks its bill of exchange or check on Donnell, Lawson &amp; Co. for $5,000, payable to the order of such bank, such bill or check, in the hands of the payee, would not operate as an assignment of any part of the debt owing by Donnell, Lawson <em>&amp; </em>Co. to the Mast\u00edn Bank (Attorney-General <em>v. </em>Continental Life Ins. Co., 71 <em>JV. Y. </em>325).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b353-7\">\u201cIn that case, the insurance company drew its check for the amount of ail adjusted loss, payable to the order of the person to whom the loss was payable. It was drawn upon an institution with which the drawer deposited its moneys, and when drawn, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>drawer had to its credit a larger sum than the amount of the check. The obvious intent of the drawer, and the only-reasonable expectation the payee could have, were, that the check would be paid, when presented, out of the funds then held by the drawee belonging to the drawer ; or, to speak with more legal accuracy, in discharge of the like amount of the drawee\u2019s indebtedness to the drawer, existing at the time of the presentment of the check before the check was presented. But, eleven days after it was drawn, a receiver of the company was appointed, and it was held that the payee of the check did not, by reason thereof, become an -equitable assignee of any part of the indebtedness of the drawee to the drawer existing when the check was drawn.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b354-4\">\u201c Church, Ch. J., in delivering the opinion of the court, says : \u2018 Banks are debtors to their ' customers for the amount of deposits. A check is a request of the customer to pay the whole or a portion of such indebtedness to the bearer or to the order of the payee. Until presented and accepted it vests no title or interest, legal or equitable, in the payee to the fund. In this case, the instruments referred to no fund; did not purport to create a lien or assignment of any fund, and the Trust Company did not even have notice of it.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b354-5\">\u201c The orders sent by the Mast\u00edn Bank to Donnell, Lawson &amp; Co. were in their terms as general as those of an ordinary check. They were, in effect, <em>\u2018 </em>pay to the order of, or credit the person named $5,000.\u2019 diving to them the most restricted meaning of which they are susceptible, they are requests to pass to the credit of each bank $5,000. They do not indicate any account of indebtedness in respect to which they are drawn, and they do not even contain any direction or authority to Donnell, Lawson &amp; Co. to charge the amount to any specified account.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b354-6\">\u201cTohold that such orders operate as an equitable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>assignment from the time they were mailed, of a like amount of the indebtedness of Donnell, Lawson &amp; Co. to the Mast\u00edn Bank, would create great embarrassments in transacting the kind of business in which they are engaged. The pernicious tendency of such a rule is well illustrated by the facts of this case. Suppose that the Mast\u00edn Bank had not failed, and the state of its accounts with Donnell, Lawson &amp; Co., on the fifth of August, had been what is proved to have been, how could Donnell, Lawson &amp; Co. ascertain what their liabilities were in respect to the four orders received on the fifth of August, at the same time, and in the same general envelope? The drafts amounted to $16,500. Their indebtedness to the Mast\u00edn Bank amounted to about $10,000. How were they to ascertain to whom the $10,000 was payable ? If each transaction is to be deemed to have been completed in Missouri, <em>eo instante </em>the orders were mailed, then each of the four orders took effect at the same moment of time ; and if that fact be conceded or should be established, then there would, or might be, a claim, that each was an equitable assignee, <em>pro tanto. </em>The defendants in this case, instead of relying upon the implied obligation of Donnell, Lawson <em>&amp; </em>Co. to pay the drafts or checks of the Mast\u00edn Bank, as they might be presented, to the extent of the amount to the credit of the Mast\u00edn Bank, gave evidence tending to show an actual agreement to pay the orders which the Mast\u00edn Bank might draw on them. But the evidence, so far as it tended to show any express agreement, was an agreement to pay the checks or drafts of the Mast\u00edn Bank, when presented, to the extent of the amount then to its credit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b355-4\">\u201cThe evidence does not justify the finding of an agreement between the Mast\u00edn Bank and the Bank of Emporia, or the Salina Bank, either expressed or that can be implied, that the remittance requested should. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>be made by any specified means, or by any designated procedure.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b356-4\">\u201c The request made by the Emporia Bank of the Mast\u00edn Bank was, that the latter should \u2018 remit to Donnell, Lawson &amp; Co. $5,000 for our account credit.\u2019 Whether the Mast\u00edn Bank would as matter of choice, or as matter of necessity, would be obliged to actually remit exchange to Donnell, Lawson &amp; Co. for the whole or a part of that amount, the Emporia Bank or the Salina Bank did not know, and could not care, provided it obtained the desired credit with Donnell, Lawson &amp; Co. It could not, therefore, have been a just expectation of the Emporia Bank, or of the Salina Bank, that the Mast\u00edn Bank would necessarily comply with the request, by drawing upon any account it then had with Donnell, Lawson <em>&amp; </em>Co., to be unaffected in its amount up to the time that the latter should hear from the Mast\u00edn Bank, by remittances to, and other drafts on Donnell, Lawson '&amp; Co., contemporaneous with or shortly anterior in date, to the date of the transaction in question. The whole amount to the credit of the Mast\u00edn Bank on August 1, 1878, according to the course of business, might have been exhausted prior to August 5, by drafts prior in date; and the amount to its credit on August 5, may have been supplied by remittances from the Mast\u00edn Bank, received by Donnell, Lawson &amp; Co. between August 1 and August 5. .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b356-5\">\u201c It cannot be concluded, therefore, \u2018 that on the said first day of August, 1878, the Mast\u00edn Bank under and in pursuance of an agreement with \u2022 these defendants and each of them, for that purpose concluded on that day, duly assigned, transferred, and set over unto these defendants the whole of said sum of $9,786.75, then on deposit with Donnell, Lawson &amp; Co.\u2019 There was no formal assignment or transfer, nor was there any agreement to make one, nor is there the slightest allusion in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>the correspondence between the Bank of Emporia or the Salina Bank and the Mast\u00edn Bank, or to the state of the account between the latter and Donnell, Lawson &amp; Co., or to the fact that any account existed between them. The answer made by the Mast\u00edn Bank to the request of the Emporia Bank to 6 remit \u2019 $5,000, was simply: \u2018we remit $5,000 to Donnell, Lawson &amp; Co., New York, to your credit.\u2019 What the Mast\u00edn Bank had done, which it called remitting, it did not disclose to the Banks of Emporia, or to the Salina Bank.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b357-4\">\u201cThe latter could not then have approved of or adopted it, as they were ignorant of it. They were in no way affected by it, and nothing could change the state of the account between them and the Mast\u00edn Bank, except an increase by the act of the latter, of the amount of the credit of the Emporia Bank, or of the Salina Bank, with Donnell, Lawson &amp; Co. A creditor, to create an equitable assignment to a third person, of a part of a sum owing to him by his debtor, must, at least, give to such third person an order directed to such debtor, directing him to pay a specified part of such debt to such third person, and the latter must notify the debtor thereof. The cases all hold, that to \u2022 constitute an equitable assignment, the order must specify the particular fund on which it is drawn (Att\u2019y Gen\u2019l <em>v. </em>Continental Life Insurance Co., 71 IV\". <em>Y. </em>325 ; Lunt y. Bank of North America, 49 <em>Barb. </em>221; Hall y. City of Buffalo, 2 <em>Abb. App. Gas. </em>301.) These cases, and the cases cited in them, illustrate the inflexibility of this rule. In the present case, the Mast\u00edn Bank did not deliver to the Bank of Emporia, any order on Donnell, Lawson <em>&amp; </em>Co., or.any other paper affecting or purporting to relate to the accounts, or to any account between the Mast\u00edn Bank and Donnell, Lawson &amp; Co. The communications between either of the defendants and the Mast\u00edn Bank, were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>simply a request by the defendant to \u2018remit,\u2019 and a reply from the Mast\u00edn Bank stating, \u2018we remit.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b358-4\">\u201cThe charges and credits which either thereupon entered in its books, were only bookkeeping entries, identifying the transactions, but binding neither, and of no benefit or prejudice to either, if the requested increase of credit was not effected.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b358-5\">\u201cIt seems to me quite clear, therefore, that neither of the defendants, by what took place between it and the Mast\u00edn Bank, became assignee of any part of the debt owing on August 1, 1878.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b358-6\">\u201cI understand this to be so, whether the effect of the transaction be determined by the laws of Missouri, or the laws of New York. I think its \u201ceffect is to be determined by the laws of New York. Though the request to \u2018 remit \u2019 reached the Mast\u00edn Bank in Missouri, what it was requested to do was to be done in New York. The increase of credit was to be effected there.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b358-7\">\u201c The action which the Mast\u00edn Bank initiated in Missouri, and described in its letter by the remark \u2018we remit,\u2019 was to be consummated in New York. It depended entirely upon what action Donnell, Lawson &amp; Co. might take upon the request made of them by the Mast\u00edn Bank, whether the request of either defendant would be complied with or not.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b358-8\">\u201cThe claims that the assignment is repugnant to the laws of the State of New York, and that the power to make it under the laws of the State of Missouri was suspended by the bankrupt act, cannot, as I think, be sustained in this action. So far as appears, no proceedings in bankruptcy were ever instituted by or against the Mast\u00edn Bank. An assignment of property can be attacked as being a fraud upon the bankrupt act, only in involuntary proceedings commenced within the period after the assignment designated in that act, or be set up in subsequent voluntary proceedings in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>bankruptcy, as a bar to the discharge of the debtor under that act (Mayor <em>v. </em>Heilman, 13 <em>Nat. Bariltr. Reg. </em>440; Yon Hun <em>v. </em>Elkers, 15 <em>Id. </em>194; Haas <em>v. </em>O\u2019Brien, 16 <em>Id. </em>508). Some of these cases go further than the rule above stated. There are no resident creditors, citizens of this or any other State, contesting the validity of the assignment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b359-4\">\u201c There do not appear to be any citizens of thin State, or other creditors of the Mas tin Bank, who have been conducting themselves with reference to the laws of this State, in regard to the property of such bank, found, or being within jurisdiction of this State, to whom those laws have impliedly promised anything as fruits of such conduct (Holmes <em>v. </em>Remsen, 20 <em>Johns. </em>264, 266).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b359-5\">\u201c There would seem to be no considerations of public policy which should induce our courts to refuse to aid the plaintiff to recover these funds, and distribute them according to the rights of the parties, as they may be determined by the laws of the State in which their business with each other was transacted. The defendants invoke the laws of Missouri, as they understand them, to support the claim that a transfer of the funds in suit was made to them. They deny the plaintiff\u2019s right to this property, and claim that the validity of the transfer to him, though made and consummated in Missouri, should not be determined by the laws of Missouri.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b359-6\">\u201cIt is difficult to perceive why the decision of the court of appeals in Boese <em>v. </em>Locke (21 <em>Alb. L. J. </em>54), is not equally applicable to this case. There are isolated decisions (viz.: that of Judge McCrary in Herman Savings Institution, and that of Judge Elmer in Merchants\u2019 National Bank <em>v. </em>Coates, cited by defendant\u2019s counsel as favoring the views on which he insists, and that of Judge Blatchford in Rosenthal <em>v. </em>Mast\u00edn Bank, cited by plaintiff\u2019s counsel as sustaining his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>views), which fail to satisfy me that the conclusion, reached is not correct. I think the fund in court should be awarded to the plaintiff, with costs.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b360-4\">Arthur, <em>Phelps, Knevals &amp; Ransom, </em>attorneys, and <em>Rastus S. Ransom, </em>of counsel, for appellants, among other things, urged</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AcU\">I. The rule settled is, that no particular form of words is necessary to constitute an equitable assignment; but there must be evidence of intention to appropriate the funds (1 <em>Barb. </em>454; 16 <em>John. </em>50 ; 19 <em>Id. </em>342-95 ; cases cited in <em>Voorhees Code, 8 </em>ed. p. 112, note q ; 68 <em>N. Y. </em>30). The rule established in Kimball <em>v. </em>Donald <em>(supra) </em>and Bank of Commerce <em>v. </em>Bogy (44 <em>Mo. </em>1), is taken from Haddock <em>v. </em>Gandell (15 <em>Eng. L. &amp; E. </em>30), and the application to the case at bar is easy. As to the intent, the course of business between the Mast\u00edn Bank and defendants and D., L. &amp; Co., and the latter\u2019s agreement to pay such \u2022orders (made when the Mast\u00edn .Bank opened its account with D., L. &amp; Co.), and the payment of similar orders previously, must be considered, and really is conclusive (Mandeville <em>v. </em>Walsh, 5 <em>Wheat. </em>277; Christmas <em>v. </em>Russell, 14 <em>Wall. </em>69 ; McLoon <em>v. </em>Linguist, 4 <em>Ben. </em>9). The particular fund need not be named in the order. Antecedent and surrounding circumstances should be . regarded (1 <em>H. Bl. </em>602; 2 <em>Cow. </em>&amp; <em>H. Notes, </em>1399 &amp; 1400 ; Bellinger <em>v. </em>Kitts, 6 <em>Barb. </em>273, 278). A new contract by D., H. &amp; Co. was not necessary to bind the fund (2 <em>Story Eq. </em>1044; <em>Exp. </em>South, 3 <em>Swans. </em>393). The orders amounted to more than the debt due from D., L. &amp; Co., exclusive of interest, and an order drawn on the whole of a debt is an equitable assignment of that debt. It is clear that the papers in question were orders, not bills of exchange (Walker <em>v. </em>Mauro, 18 <em>Mo. </em>564; McCain <em>v. </em>Weidemeyner, 25 <em>Mo. </em>366). Suppose, after the mailing of these orders and their receipt by D., L. <em>&amp; </em>Co., the Mast\u00edn Bank had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>notified them not to pay them, would they have been bound to regard that notice ? I submit that they would not. The transfer was complete. D., L. &amp; Co. had previously been instructed by the Mast\u00edn Bank to pay such orders and had paid them, and had agreed to pay them. This agreement was for the benefit of the defendants, and their assent thereto is presumed (Rogers <em>v. </em>Gasnell, 58 <em>Mo. </em>589 ; 2 <em>Greenl. on Ev. </em>\u00a7 109). The following cases are decisive upon the question under consideration: Lett <em>v. </em>Morris (4 <em>Sim. </em>607); <em>Bispham Eq. </em>221, 2 ed. ; Yeates <em>v. </em>Graves (1 <em>Ves. Jr. </em>279, 280); Biron <em>v. </em>Carvalho (4 <em>Mylne &amp; C. </em>702): Hall <em>v. </em>City of Buffalo (1 Keyes, 193). The orders in question were accepted by D., L. &amp; Co., because they had agreed to pay them. They had notice of them, as shown by the telegram from Salina Bank; also by the receipt of them through the mails. Hot being bills of exchange, an oral acceptance was good (McMenomy <em>&amp; </em>Townsend <em>v. </em>Ferrers, 3 <em>Johns. </em>82, 83, and the cases there cited ; Hosack v. Rogers, 6 <em>Paige, </em>415 ; Hall <em>v. </em>City of Buffalo, 1 <em>Keyes, </em>193 ; Vreeland <em>v. </em>Blunt, 6 <em>Barb. </em>182 ; Weston v. Barker, 12 <em>Johns. </em>276 ; Canfield <em>v. </em>Monger, 12 <em>Id. </em>346 ; 2 <em>Story Eq. Jur. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 972, 1039, 1040, 1041, 1042, 1044 to 1048, and to 1057). As to equitable assignment by order unaccepted, see Parker v. City Syracuse (31 <em>N. Y. </em>376); Reilly <em>v. </em>Demestro (7 <em>W. D. </em>434); Woodfalk <em>v. </em>Bank of America (11 <em>Alb. L.J. </em>103). These orders were but banker\u2019s checks, and in equity, as between drawer and defendants, are assignments or appropriations of so much of the fund, and the bank on which they are drawn is liable to the holder (McGrade <em>v. </em>German Savings Bank, 4 <em>Mo. App. </em>330, 401). The mailing by the Mast\u00edn Bank to D., L. &amp; Co. of the orders in question, completed the transfer of the fund to defendants, and their title thereto became vested, and on this we must bear in mind the mailing of the postal card by the Mast\u00edn <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>Bank to defendants, advising them that they had remitted (1 <em>Pars, on Cont. </em>[6 ed.], 484, &amp;c. ; <em>2 Id. 582 </em>; Vassar <em>v. </em>Camp, 11 <em>N. Y. </em>441; Minnesota Oil Co. <em>v. </em>Collier Lead Co., 4 <em>Dill. </em>431; Johnson <em>v. </em>Sharp, 31 <em>Ohio, </em>611; Longstrass <em>v. </em>German Ins. Co., 48 <em>Mo. </em>201; 6 <em>Wend. </em>103 ; 1 <em>Barn. &amp; Ald. </em>681; 1 <em>Mo. App. </em>585; 36 <em>N. Y. </em>307).</p>\n<p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b362-4\">II. The plaintiff took, by the assignment to him, the assets of the Mast\u00edn Bank, subject to all liens thereon, and equities existing in favor of the creditors of the bank. This proposition will not be denied, and is amply sustained by authority.</p>\n<p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b362-5\">III. The assignment to plaintiff is void under the laws of this State. The defendants are not residents of this State nor of Missouri. They are and were residents of Kansas. They are, therefore, entitled to the same rights in regard to the effect of the assignment to plaintiff, as they would be if citizens of this State. That the assignment is void, see <em>Wharton on Conflict of Laws, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 353, 348, a; Mosschman <em>v. </em>Cain (34 <em>Barb. </em>66). The rule is universal, in all the States, that an assignment made in another State will not be held valid when-it conflicts with laws of the State where it is sought to be enforced <em>(Story's Conflict of </em>Laws, \u00a7 344; Bryan <em>v. </em>Brisbin, 26 <em>Mo. </em>423 ; Kelly <em>v. </em>Crapo, 45 <em>N. Y. </em>94; Holmes <em>v. </em>Remsen, 20 <em>Johns. </em>264; Guillandet <em>v. </em>Howell, 35 <em>N. Y. </em>657). The Missouri statute in regard to assignments is, to all intents and purposes, an insolvent law, and as such was suspended by the bankrupt act, and contrary to the laws of this State (Boese <em>v. </em>Locke, 17 <em>Hun, </em>270 ; Bayley <em>v. </em>Greenleaf, 7 <em>Wheat. </em>54, 55 ; Green <em>v. </em>Demoss, 10 <em>Hump. </em>371; Globe Ins. Co. <em>v. </em>Cleveland Ins. Co., 13 <em>Alb. L. J. </em>305; Claflin <em>v. </em>Horseman, 14 <em>Id. </em>373). The case of Boese v. Locke <em>(supra), </em>was reversed in the court of appeals (78 <em>N. Y. </em>471), but we submit that the New Jersey statute there considered is essentially different from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>that of Missouri. What we claim in regard to the Missouri statute is, that it created the right to make the assignment, and is, in fact, a State insolvent law, under which an insolvent debtor may distribute his property under restrictions and upon conditions not allowable under the common law, and hence was suspended by the bankrupt act. The principles laid down by the court at general term in Boese <em>v. </em>Locke <em>(supra), </em>are not questioned by the court of appeals, only that they were not applicable to that particular case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b363-4\">IY. The law of the place where the contract is made must govern, except it be an executory contract, in which case the the law of the place where the contract is to be performed, will control. The contract we are inspecting was that made between the Mast\u00edn Bank and the defendants, August 1, 1878, at Kansas City, not results that were to follow from such contract. It was a contract then and there fully executed and complete, by which the Mast\u00edn Bank intended to then and there assign to the defendants a debt due it by Dy L. &amp; Co., and the defendants intended to accept such assignment as actual payment to them of their debt due by the Mast\u00edn Bank. When these orders were delivered by the Mast\u00edn Bank to the public mails, that constituted delivery to the defendants. Such mailing was the final act on the part of the Mastin' Bank in transferring its debt due by D., L. &amp; Co., to defendants; and from that moment it lost all right, title and interest in the said debt. At to the effect of the mailing: see Barry <em>v. </em>Equitable Life Insurance Co. (59 <em>N. Y. </em>594).</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b363-5\"><em>Holmes &amp; Adams, </em>attorneys and <em>George H </em>Adams\u201e of counsel, for respondent.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b363-6\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"AhR\">The judgment should be affirmed, with costs, upon the opinion of the referee.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
