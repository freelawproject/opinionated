Letters testamentary were issued to them on March 4, 1870. On January 3,1871, Daly was released and discharged as executor under the will, and has never since acted as such. Hogan continued to act as executor until September 19, 1879, when he was superseded by order of the surrogate, and letters of administration with the will annexed, were issued to the widow, Mary Curtin, the defendant herein. Daniel Curtin left him surviving, his widow, Mary Curtin, two sons, and Mary Ann Curtin, an only daughter. Curtin left personal property of the value of about $500, and real estate of the value of about $40,000. That real estate remains unsold and unincumbered. In the year 1871, Mary Curtin, the widow of Daniel Curtin, married one David Curtin, with whom she has since lived.' On February 14, 1878, Mary Ann Curtin, the daughter of Daniel Curtin, married the plaintiff herein at Jersey City. She died May 29, 1879. Before her death she had been paid the sum of $500 on account of the-bequest to her under the will of her father. There is no property of the deceased Daniel Curtin in existence, except the real' estate, which is now of the value of $40,000. On July 7, 1879, the plaintiff, John J. Hogan, was duly appointed the administrator of Mary Ann Hogan, formerly Curtin, and duly qualified as such.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b278-6\">\u201cThe question of fact in controversy in this case is whether Mary Ann Curtin married the plaintiff with the consent of her mother and the executors of her father\u2019s will. If not with the consent of both executors and mother,; did she have the consent of the executor, and did the marriage of her mother render it unnec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>essary for the purposes of this bequest that Mary Ann Curtin should obtain the consent of her mother <em>% </em>The question of law is, whether, in case the plaintiff, as the administrator of Mary Ann Curtin, is entitled to judgment for the sum of $16,000, or the sum of $5,000, this court should order the administratrix to sell or mortgage the real estate for the payment thereof ? f\u00edo controversy is made against the plaintiff\u2019s right to recover from the administratrix the sum of $5,000, less the $500 already paid, because Mary Ann Curtin was entitled to that sum upon her marriage, even without the consent of the executors or of her mother.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b279-5\">\u201c After a careful examination of the evidence, I am of the opinion that Mary Ann Curtin did not obtain her mother\u2019s consent to her marriage, but did obtain the consent of Patrick Hogan, at that time the only executor of her father\u2019s will. While the will indicates the wish of the testator to transfer the custody and control of his children to his executors in case of his widow\u2019s marriage, it nowhere says in terms, or says anything from which we could infer the intent of the testator, that the mother\u2019s consent should not be necessary to the daughter\u2019s marriage, if she married before arriving at twenty-one years of age, in order to entitle her to the full sum of $16,000 upon such marriage. The obtaining of the executor\u2019s consent alone was, therefore, not enough. The condition upon which the bequest was based was, that she should obtain not only the executor\u2019s, but her mother\u2019s consent, before she could obtain the $16,000. The testator, it is true, wished the custody of the children transferred to the executors in case of his widow\u2019s marriage, but did not indicate, even in such case, his wish that the condition of the bequest to his daughter should be relaxed. In point of fact, the executor did not assume the custody of the children on the widow\u2019s marriage. As the condition of the bequest was not complied with, the be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>quest falls, and returns to the residuary devisees under the will. To the sum of $5,000 Mary Ann Curtin did become entitled upon her marriage, and it passed, of course, as a personal asset to her administrator. In that sum, less the $500 paid \u2022 to Mary Curtin in her life-time, he is entitled to judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b280-5\">\u201cThe only remaining question then is whether this court has the power to order the administratrix, with the will annexed as such, to sell or mortgage the real estate for the payment of this bequest. I am disposed to think it has. The real estate was devised by the testator to his executors for the payment of the several bequests contained in the will. It is too old and well settled a proposition of law to need even the citation of authorities in its support, that when a devisor has directed or authorized the conversion of his real estate, even for a particular special purpos\u00e9, such as distribution, courts .are bound so long as the purpose and object exist and continue, to regard it as of that species of property into which it was directed to be converted; and to the extent and for the purpose declared, it is to be treated as money and n\u00f3t land. Here the devisor left but little personal property. There is no room for doubt of the testator\u2019s intention. In the 13th subdivision of the will he empowered his executors to sell or mortgage his real estate to pay his debts and legacies.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b280-6\">\u201cThe question whether or not-the other children of Daniel Curtin, who by the third subdivision of the will are made residuary devisees, ought to have been made parties to the record in order to have all persons interested in the construction of the will before the court, and so bound by its decision, was not argued before me orally, nor is it discussed in the written briefs submitted to me by counsel. So far as the present defendant is concerned, a defect of parties is waived\u2014not having been taken by demurrer or answer (Code, \u00a7 499). But a purchaser or mortgagee under the judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>might wish <em>to </em>have the residuary devisees absolutely cut off.' That, of course, could not be done unless they are parties to the action. If this view should be accepted by counsel, the heirs can be made parties defendant by amendment, and permission to that effect is granted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b281-5\">\u201cThe plaintiff is entitled to judgment for the sum of $5,000, less the $500 received by Mary Ann Curtin in her life-time, with interest from the date of the marriage, Feb. 14, 1878, and the costs of this action.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b281-6\"><em>James M. Smith </em>and <em>William </em>Allen, for appellant, urged:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ah2\">I. The only question presented to the court for determination is a question of law. \u201cWhere the intent of a testator is to be ascertained from, the language of the will alone, or from the language and surrounding circumstances about which there- is no dispute, a question of law for the determination of the court alone is presented. It is the duty of the court to interpret the language of the will as read in the light of those facts (Underhill <em>v. </em>Vandervoot, 56 <em>N. Y. </em>242).</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b281-7\">II. 1. The bequest is of $16,000, to the testator\u2019s daughter Mary Ann, with a provision as to the time of payment. Under certain circumstances, the bequest is' reduced to $5,000, the difference going with the residuary estate. There is no express devise or bequest over. 2. The provisions as to the time of payment covered the three possible contingencies, <em>viz.:\u2014a. </em>The daughter might reach the age of twenty-one years unmarried. 5. She might marry under that age <em>with </em>the specified consent, c. She might marry under that age, <em>without </em>the specified consent. The provision for payment, on her attaining twenty-one years, covered the first and last of such contingencies. The provision for payment on her earlier marriage with consent covered the second contingency. The possibility of her premature death unmarried, was covered by the devise or be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>quest over to the testator\u2019s sons, taking effect, however, on their attaining the age of twenty-one years. There is no devise or bequest over, however, in the event of the marriage of the testator\u2019s daughter. 3. The case in which the substituted bequest was to take effect was her marriage, \u201cagainst the consent of my said executors and her mother;\u201d on this the first question arises. The question is, whether she took the $16,000 bequest, or the substituted bequest of $5,000. This was a bequest of $16,000, liable to be defeated by a condition subsequent. The condition subsequent was the marriage of the legatee against the consent of the executors and the mother (Graydon <em>v. </em>Hicks, <em>2 Atk. </em>15). Did she violate this condition <em>% </em>This case has five possible modes in which the question may be raised. 1. She might marry without the affirmative consent of both. <em>2. </em>She might m&amp;rry in opposition to the express dissent of both. 3. She might marry with the affirmative consent of one alone\u2014the other being silent and not affirmatively assenting. <em>4. </em>She might marry in opposition to the express dissent of one\u2014the other being silent, and not expressly dissenting. 5. She might marry with the affirmative consent of one, and the express dissent of the other. The case at bar comes under the third mode only. Is it a violation of the condition ? In order to defeat a devise or bequest by non-performance of a condition, it must be strictly construed, and in favor of the devise or bequest. The condition was her marriage against the consent of both. The consent of either justified the marriage. The third mode is not a violation, because, 1. There is a distinction between marrying without the consent of two persons, and marrying against the consent of two persons. In the first, she would have to obtain their consent affirmatively. In the second, the marriage with the consent of one, would not be a marriage against the consent of two. There is a difference be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>tween marrying without consent and marrying against consent (Fleming <em>v. </em>Walgrave, 1 <em>Chan. Cas. </em>58; Creagh <em>v. </em>Wilson, 2 Vernon, 573; Reynish <em>v. </em>Martin, 3 <em>Atk. </em>330). 2d. Irrespective of the propositions of law hereinafter advanced and qualifications made by the testator in subsequent portions of his will, to sustain the decision of the special term, \u201cand\u201d must be read \u201c or,\u201d that is\u2014that the condition is broken if the marriage is without the consent of each of them; or is against the consent of either the executor or the mother. \u201cAnd\u201d may in certain cases be read as <em>\u201c </em>or,\u201d but not to defeat a devise or bequest made to child of the testator, nor to restrain marriage. It must be to support and carry out the intention of the testator (Roome <em>v. </em>Phillips, 24 N. <em>Y. </em>468). Conditions in restraint of marriage, without consent, are so far discouraged by the law, that they are construed, strictly, in favor of the persons on whom such restraints are-laid (Gr<em>eenleaf's Cruise on Real </em>Property\u2014Title XII. Est. on Con. c. 1, \u00a7 61, p. 19; Long <em>v. </em>Dennis, 4 <em>Burr. </em>2052 ; Daly <em>v. </em>Clanrickarde, 2 <em>Atk. </em>261; Bolton <em>v. </em>Humphries; 1 <em>Story's Eq. Jur., </em>Redfield\u2019s ed\u201e [ninth] \u00a7 286, p. 267 <em>et seq). </em>There being no express or immediate devise or bequest over of the legacy in question, the condition is ineffectual. See section 287 of Story\u2019s Equity Jurisprudence as to distinctions which, have been made in cases where there was a bequest, over, and cases where there is not a bequest over.. \u201c Where there is no bequest over, the condition is-treated as ineffectual upon the ground that the testator is to be deemed to use the condition <em>in terrorem </em>only, and not to impose a forfeiture, since he has failed to make any other disposition of the bequest upon default in the condition\u201d (Garret <em>v. </em>Pritty, 2 <em>Vernon, </em>293; Wheeler <em>v. </em>Bingham, 1 <em>Wils. </em>135 ; Parsons <em>v. </em>Winslow, 6 <em>Mass. </em>169 ; 1 <em>Jarman Wills, </em>4 Am. ed. 710 <em>et. </em>seq.; 1 <em>Roper </em>Legacies, 746; Ludlow <em>v. </em>New York <em>&amp; </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>Harlem R. R Co., 12 <em>Bard. </em>440). \u201c There is another well-established principle, by which the bequest over is prevented from giving efficacy to the limitation under consideration. The principle is, that the bequest over, to give it the effect now under consideration, must be immediate, so as to take effect at the time of marriage\u201d (Doe <em>v. </em>Freeman, 1 <em>D. &amp; E. </em>389 ; Parsons <em>v. </em>Winslow, <em>supra). </em>By the seventh subdivision of the will it will be perceived that the shares of the testator\u2019s estate, real and personal, devised and bequeathed to the testator\u2019s sons James and Francis, did not take effect until they attained twenty-one years of age, and in the event of the death of either without lawful issue, the share of the son so dying shall go to and belong to the survivor. See also eighth subdivision of the will, which provides for the executors selling the real estate, investing the proceeds, and out of the proceeds supporting and maintaining the children until the age of twen ty-one years. Thus, at the time of Mary Ann\u2019s marriage, James was about eigh teen years of age, and Francis about eleven years of age, and hence, even if there had been an express bequest of the particular legacy to Mary Ann, to either of his two sons, as it was not to take effect at the time of the marriage, the limitation would be nugatory. The only devise and bequest over made in the case at bar was by the fourteenth subdivision of the will, \u201cI give, devise, and bequeath all the rest, residue and remainder of my said real and personal estate of every name and nature to my said son James Curtin.\u201d The bequest was of $16,000, liable to be partially defeated by a condition subsequent. \u25a0 \u201cConditions are precedent or subsequent:\u2014\u201cThus where a condition must be performed before the estate can commence, it is called a condition precedent. But where the effect of a condition is either to enlarge or defeat an estate already created, it is then called a condition subsequent (1 <em>Greenl. Cruise Real </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>Property, Tit. XIII. Est. on Con. \u00a7 6 ; Finlay v. King\u2019s Lessee, 3 Peters, 374). In Graydon v. Hicks (2 Atk. 15), Lord Chancellor Hardwicks says: \u201c Where the condition is become impossible, by the person dying, whose consent was necessary before the marriage, it is an excuse. I am likewise of the'opinion that this is only a condition subsequent, to divest the legacy, in case of a marriage before twenty-one.\u201d The executors in that case were dead, at the time of the daughter\u2019s marriage. In the case at bar, by the action of the mother the daughter was, by the terms of her father\u2019s will, released entirely from her mother\u2019s control, just as much as if she had died in place of married again, as will be perceived by the next point. The case of Peyton <em>v. </em>Bury (2 <em>P. Will. </em>625), also holds that such a condition is a condition subsequent, and not a condition precedent. It may be claimed under some of the English cases, that where the legacy is charged on the lands, the condition imposed must be strictly complied with, to make the legacy a charge on the lands. That is the rule where the condition annexed to the devise or bequest is a condition precedent, and not a condition subsequent (Reynish <em>v. </em>Martin, 3 <em>Atk. </em>334 ; Harvey <em>v. </em>Afton, 1 <em>Atk. </em>443). Under the decisions of the court of appeals of this State, cited under the last point, a bequest, even where it is directly charged on the land, \u201cis to the extent and for the purpose declared to be treated as money and not land.\u201d It is well settled that there is an equitable conversion into personalty at the date of the death of the testator.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b285-5\">III. On the marriage of the testator\u2019s widow, the operation of the will is equivalent to a revocation of the trust reposed in her by the fourth clause, dispensed with her consent to her daughter\u2019s marriage, and is conclusive on the question, that \u201cand\u201d is not to be read \u201c or \u201d to defeat the bequest to his daughter. Such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>an intent cannot be imputed to him. The motive for the bequest was his affection for his child, not the performance of the condition. \u201cThe ties which Connect the testator with his legatees, the affection subsisting between them, the motives which may reasonably be supposed to operate with him, and to influence him in the disposition of his property, are all entitled to consideration in expounding doubtful words, and ascertaining the meaning in which the testator used them\u201d (Smith <em>v. </em>Bell, 6 Peters, 68; Hoppock <em>v. </em>Tucker, 59 <em>N. Y. </em>202 ; Mann <em>v. </em>Mann, 14. <em>Johns. </em>1; Hilliard <em>v. </em>Kearney, 1 <em>Bush. </em>[N. <em>C.] Eq. </em>221; Lines <em>v. </em>Darden, 5 <em>Fla. </em>51). The testator classes his widow\u2019s marriage with her death. Can it be seriously contended that notwithstanding the directions of the will, the testator still intended that the mother of Mary Ann, his daughter, should control her in her marriage ? Suppose that Mary Ann had gone to her mother and asked her consent to her marriage, and the mother had said no ! Surely that would have been control, and control in a matter the most vital and important to every young woman. \u201cControl\u201d (substantive) means\u2014 check, restraint, power, authority, superintendence, government, command. \u201cControl\u201d (verb) means\u2014to place or keep under restraint, to have under command and direction, to restrain, rule, govern or direct. . -</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b286-5\"><em>Samuel G. </em>Courtney, for respondent.</attorneys>\n<footnote data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b275-12\"> It does not appear, from the findings of the court below, that such marriage was <em>against </em>her mother\u2019s consent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b286-6\">By the Court.\u2014Freedman, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AZe\">Granting that the construction of wills the rule is that where the \u25a0effect of a condition is either to enlarge or to defeat an estate already created, it is deemed a condition subsequent ; that in the case of a condition subsequent, where the estate is not given over, it will be considered as only <em>in terrorem; </em>that a condition in restraint of marriage, without consent, must be construed strictly in favor o\u00ed the person on whom the restraint is laid ; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>that the general intent of the testator is to prevail, and that that intent is to be gathered not from a part, but from the whole of the will, so that an intent inferable from the language of a particular clause may be qualified or changed by other portions of the will, evincing' a different intent,-\u2014granting that all these propositions are sound in law in the abstract, and should be made to govern, if applicable\u2014I am nevertheless of the opinion that upon the facts as found, and as to which there is no dispute, the learned judge below arrived at the proper conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">The bequest of $16,000 to Mary Ann, was made to depend on the happening of either of two contingencies, viz. : on her arriving at the full age of twenty-one, or on her marrying before that time with the joint consent of her mother and the executors named in the will. Neither of these contingencies occurred, for she died when she was about eighteen, and she had then been married to the plaintiff for more than one year without the consent of her mother. In the case of her marriage before twenty-one, the joint consent of her mother and the executors to the marriage was a condition precedent. This follows not only from the interpretation of the particular clause creating the bequest, but from the construction of the will as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">- Having married without such joint consent, and died before she arrived at the prescribed age, the provision made for her consisted of a legacy of $5,000, for which, sum judgment has been awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">The judgment should be affirmed, with costs, upon the opinion of the learned judge below.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">Sedgwick, Oh. J., and Truax, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"+\" orphan=\"true\">\n<p id=\"b275-13\"> The question whether the testator\u2019s daughter, had she lived to the age of twenty-one years, would, under the facts, be entitled to $16,000, was not before the court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
