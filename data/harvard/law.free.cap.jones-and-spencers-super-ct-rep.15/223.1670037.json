R. Weichsel &amp; Co., of Hassfurt, Magdeburg, through their representative, Mr. Carl Bartels, 76 Beaver street,\u201d a certain quantity of salt, upon certain terms ; that the plaintiff duly performed all the conditions on his part to be performed, but that defendant refused to accept, &amp;c. The answer contained a general denial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b248-7\">At the trial, before testimony was given, defendant\u2019s counsel moved to dismiss complaint on ground that it did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. Before the decision of that motion, plaintiff\u2019s counsel moved to amend the complaint by alleging that the plaintiff did business under the name of R. Weichsel &amp; Co. The record proceeds, \u201c Now, on motion of attorneys for the plaintiff, ordered that the plaintiff have leave to amend his complaint by alleging \u2018 that the plaintiff did business under the name of R. Weichsel &amp; Co.\u2019 upon the payment of the costs of the term and of the defendant\u2019s witnesses\u2019 fees, together with all the costs of defendant after notice of trial, to be taxed by the clerk of this court, the same to be paid within four days after the entry of this order. Otherwise, on motion of H. F. Pultz, attorney for the defendant, motion to dismiss the plaintiff\u2019s complaint in this action is hereby granted, with costs and disbursements.\u201d The judge gave to the plaintiff twenty days to make a case after the entry of judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b248-8\">The judgment of dismissal was entered. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>plaintiff appeals from the j udgment and. also from the order above stated.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b249-5\"><em>Lewis </em>Sanders, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b249-6\"><em>Henry F. </em>Pultz, for respondent.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b249-7\">By the Court.\u2014Sedgwick, Ch. J.</author>\n<p id=\"A8M\">The substance of the direction made by the judge at the trial, was that the complaint be dismissed, unless the plaintiff amend the complaint, and that he have leave to amend upon payment of cost within four days. The proceeding is somewhat confused by putting into the form of an order what really was a proceeding upon the trial, and the subject, as to form, of an exception. If the direction given was wholly the result of an adverse motion by the defendant\u2019s counsel, there might be a question, whether the leave to amend prevented the plaintiff\u2019s examining the correctness of the dismissal of the complaint. But the leave to amend was given upon the request of plaintiff\u2019s counsel. The plaintiff\u2019s counsel argues that it was erroneous to make the leave to amend conditional upon- the payment of costs. As, however, they were to be paid within four days, and the plaintiff\u2019s counsel took that delay, the plaintiff has had some advantage from the leave to amend, and must be bound by the order made. He might at the time have refused to take the order as to amendment. On the whole, as instead of an absolute dismissal, it was made conditional upon plaintiff\u2019s not amending, at his own request, the only relief he was entitled to was to amend, and then proceed with the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">I am of opinion that, on the merits, the complaint was demurrable. The complaint does not aver that the plaintiff and defendant agreed to the legal effect of the written agreement, without stating the written agreement itself, or that the defendant bought and the plaintiff sold, upon certain terms, &amp;c. He confines <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>himself to the bare statement that he \u201c entered into an agreement in writing, of which the following is a copy.\u201d Then the copy shows on its face that the defendant bought of third persons or a copartnership. It is not a <em>material </em>fact, that the plaintiff did enter into that agreement. The defendant is bound to performance, according to the terms of the agreement. A promise to accept from some one other than the plaintiff does not result in an obligation to accept from the plaintiff and to pay him. It may easily be admitted that the fact was that the plaintiff did business under the name of Messrs. It. Weichsel &amp; Go., and that he was the party in interest. That fact is not alleged, and the complaint states facts which, in the absence of other allegations, show that Messrs. R. Weichsel &amp; Co. are entitled to receive the damages from the defendant, if he be liable at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">Judgment and orders appealed from are affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">Freedman and Truax, JJ., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
