It must appear that plaintiff had, at the time of the alleged wrongful acts, some interest in, or lien upon the property, which could be the subject of damage.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b418-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number><em>It seems, </em>that the proper action, in such case, is in the nature of a creditor\u2019s bill to set aside the mortgage, and that the judgment therein should direct that defendant account for the property mortgaged, or its proceeds.</headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b418-5\">Before Sedgwick, Oh.

It was not shown that the defendant Curley sold the goods under the chattel mortgage after execution on the judgment was issued. It is to be inferred that the contrary was the case. The plaintiff did not ask for judgment declaring the chattel mortgage void as against him, or that defendant Curley account for the proceeds, nor was the value of the goods at the time of issuing the execution shown. The plaintiff asked for a money judgment, only. The court, after finding that the chattel mortgage was fraudulent and void against the plaintiff, ordered that this money judgment be entered.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b419-6\"><em>Starr O. Hooker, </em>attorney, and <em>George H. </em>Starr, of counsel, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b419-7\"><em>Henry B. Hathaway, </em>for respondent.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b419-8\"><em>Adolphus J). Pape, </em>for other creditors of defendant Doyle.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b419-9\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"APR\">It does not appear that the action were tried as if it were on a creditors bill to set aside the chattel mortgage. If it had been, the appropriate judgment would have been that the defendants account for the property mortgaged, or its proceeds. The appellant would not, in any event, have been liable for any greater sum, than the value of the property, or the proceeds obtained by him. If such were the action, it might in some cases be proper simply to set aside the judgment, and to declare the proper judgment, the action then to be remitted for further proceedings. Such a disposition would not be proper in this case, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>the defendant did not offer testimony below, for sufficient reasons, and further evidence might affect the findings, as to the fraudulent character of the mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">But it would appear that the action, was brought as one at law, for damages, a jury trial being waived by the appellant. On that position, the plaintiff had no cause of action at law. At the time that the alleged wrongful act was done, the plaintiff had no lien upon the property mortgaged by execution issued or any interest in the property, which could be the subject of damage (Adler <em>v. </em>Fenton, <em>24 How. </em>[ <em>U. S.] </em>408; Moran <em>v. </em>Dawes, <em>Hopk. Ch. </em>415 [365]; 13 <em>N. Y. </em>488 ; 32 <em>N. Y. </em>457). For this reason, the judgment should be reversed, with costs of appeal to appellant, to abide the event of the new trial, which is ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">There was also an appeal from an order denying defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial, on the ground of surprise, and of newly discovered evidence. The discretion of the court bn this subject is best exercised by affirming the order, without costs to either party.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
