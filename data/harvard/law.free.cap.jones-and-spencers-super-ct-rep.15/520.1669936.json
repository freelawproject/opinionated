RENTON MARTINO, Respondent, <em>v. </em>THE COMMERCE FIRE INSURANCE COMPANY, Appellant.</parties>\n<p data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b544-5\">Before Speir and Freedman, JJ.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b544-6\"><em>Decided February </em>7, 1881.</decisiondate>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b544-7\"><em>By-lam of corporation\u2014may be disregarded by board of </em>directors.\u2014 <em>Contract'of employment by corporation.</em></headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b544-8\">Appeal from a judgment in favor, of the plaintiff, entered on the \u25a0 verdict of a jury, and from an order denying defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial, on the minutes.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b544-9\">The action was brought to recover the balance of salary claimed by the plaintiff to be due to him from the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b544-10\">On or' about January 1,1878, plaintiff was employed by defendant for the year at a salary of $1,500. On June 3, 1878, the defendant having determined to go into liquidation, a resolution was passed at a regular meeting of its board of directors, instructing the officers to notify the employees that their services would not be required after June 30, 1878.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b544-11\">In pursuance of that resolution, the plaintiff was dismissed on September 12, 1878, and this action was brought to recover the proportion of his salary from that day, to January 1, 1878, with interest.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b544-12\">The defendant claims that the plaintiff\u2019s removal was justified under one of its by-laws, and the act authorizing the making thereof, of which by-law the following is a copy: 1 \u2018 The President shall hold his office during the term for which he shall be elected, unless .removed by cause; and <em>other </em>officers, <em>clerks and </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number><em>messengers during the pleasure of the board;\u201d </em>that under this by-law it was not in the power of the board of directors or of the president and secretary of the committee to make an employment of the plaintiff, which was not terminable at the pleasure of the board. Defendant moved to dismiss the complaint upon the 'plaintiff\u2019s evidence, on this ground, which motion was denied, and defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b545-6\">It, appeared that the board delegated power in. regard to the employment of officers or clerks, to an advisory committee, and it was under the advice of that committee that a reduction of salaries and re-engagement of employees for. the ensuing year, took place about January 1, 1878. The proposition contained in these minutes of such committee, was communicated to, and accepted by the plaintiff, after taking some time for deliberation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b545-7\">The court at General Term, said: \u201c The plaintiff was dealing directly with the defendant\u2019s board, and the question of authority of the defendant\u2019s secretary and president has no relevancy in the case, so far as the January interview was concerned, when the contract in suit was consummated. After all, the by-law in question was a mere rule of conduct, imposed on itself, by the defendant, for its own benefit and convenience, and could be set aside at any time, as it clearly was within the power of the board to disregard, its own rules.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b545-8\">\u201cThere is nothing in the by-law which forbids the defendant from entering into a special contract with, the plaintiff, whereby the clerks should hold their positions \u2018 during the pleasure of the board.\u2019 \u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b545-9\"><em>Scott &amp; </em>Crowell, attorneys, and <em>W.
