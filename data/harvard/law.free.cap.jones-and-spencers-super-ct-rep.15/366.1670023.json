At most the execution of the undertaking by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>Hartwell was a mere irregularity, and would not affect the jurisdiction of the court or warrant the court in vacating the attachment (Wilmont v. Meserole, 48 <em>How. Pr. </em>430 ; S. C., 16 <em>Abb. Pr. N. S. </em>309 ; Kissam v. Marshall, 10 <em>Abb. Pr. </em>424). The courts make the rules,, and they can suspend or modify them as circumstances may require (Martine <em>v. </em>Lowenstien, 68 <em>N. Y. </em>456.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b391-5\">II. Hartwell, under the circumstances, would have been qualified as bail; semble, that he could also join, in an undertaking (Wheeler v. Wilcox, 7 <em>Abb. Pr. </em>73).</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b391-6\">III. If any defect existed it was a mere irregularity,, and the proper subject of an amendment <em>(Code </em>Civ. <em>Pro. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 723, 724, 729, 730 ; Irwin <em>v. </em>Judd, 20 <em>Hun, </em>562 ; Holmes <em>v. </em>McDowell, 15 <em>Hun, </em>585 ; affi\u2019d 76 <em>N.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"A9I\">Rule 5 of the General Rules provides that in no case \u201c shall an attorney or counselor be surety on any undertaking or bond required by law.\u201d So far as bail was concerned, this was declaratory of a long existing rule. The existing rule was not, however, applied to the case of attorneys who had retired from practice for a long time (The King v. Inney, <em>2 East, </em>182; Bill v. Gate, 1 <em>Taunt. </em>162). The reason of the prohibition did not apply to such a case. It was not intended to apply a rule of a larger scope to undertakings. In this case it appeared that the surety, although at one time an attorney, had altogether left practice for some time, and was engaged in another vocation. The time was more than a year. There is no occasion to disturb the judgment of the court below, that the time, under the circumstances, was sufficient to bring the case within the limitation of the rule above referred to.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">Order affirmed with $10 costs, and disbursements to be taxed.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-9\">Freedman, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
