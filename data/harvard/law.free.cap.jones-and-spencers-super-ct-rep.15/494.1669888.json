Conner,_ Brb and Watson.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b519-8\">This case has been tried before, when verdict was directed for defendants. On appeal the verdict was set aside (46 <em>Super. Ct. </em>91).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b519-9\">The action was for alleged false imprisonment. The deceased Conner had been sheriff, and during his term, arrested plaintiff by virtue of an order of arrest. The plaintiff gave the usual underbaking with sureties. These were excepted to, and from time to time, the justification was adjourned, until finally it was stipulated that defendant have five days after the decision of a motion to vacate the order of arrest, within which to serve notice of justification. A deputy of the sheriff sent to the present plaintiff\u2019s attorneys, a note that the undertaking should be approved of at once, either by the judge on justification, or by consent. The attorneys answered in a note which enclosed a copy of the stipulation. It was a question on the trial whether this note reached its address. After the sheriff\u2019s term had expired, he wrote upon the undertaking the following: \u201c Serapio Arteaga is hereby remanded to jail for non-justification of the annexed undertaking, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>James H. Brb is hereby deputized to execute the within remand,\u201d and signed it as late sheriff. The defendant, Brb, thereupon, by virtue of the undertaking and its indorsement, arrested plaintiff and gave him into the custody of the defendant, Watson, who was warden of the jail, appointed by the sheriff in office. Watson committed him to jail. The time for justification of the sureties under the stipulation, had not expired.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b520-5\"><em>Vanderpoel, Oreen &amp; Cuming, </em>attorneys, and <em>Almon Ooodwin, </em>of counsel, for appellants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b520-6\"><em>Nelson Smith &amp; Leavitt, </em>attorneys, and <em>John Brooks Leavitt, </em>of counsel, for respondent.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b520-7\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"A0G\">There is a question made as to the liability of def\u00e9ndant Watson. It is argued that his action in detaining plaintiff in jail was justified by the fact that the remand was regular in form or on its face, and he was therefore protected, as officers are, who execute process that is regular and valid in appearance. The remand was not a judicial process. The sheriff was no more than any other person would be who had become bail <em>(Code of Pro. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 188, 189). His assertion of the existence of a fact, viz., that the bail had failed to justify, did not have any special force. It was the existence of the fact that would give authority to surrender. The jailer was bound to know that the person making the surrender had authority to make it.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">It was also urged that it should have been left to the jury, as to whether notice of making the stipulation had reached the sheriff or any of his agents. In the first place, the letter containing the notice was admissible as affecting the measure of damages. There would have been ground for urging that, if the sheriff had received such notice, his action in arresting was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>so willful or malicious, that the plaintiff was entitled to exemplary damages. The objection to the letter was properly overruled. Afterwards, when the court held, that on the whole case, the plaintiff was entitled to only compensatory damages, it became immaterial for the jury to ascertain whether the notice had reached the sheriff.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">The damages are not so large that the court can declare them to be excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">Judgment affirmed, with costs, and order denying motion for new trial, made upon the minutes, affirmed, with $10 costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
