John Morrow.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b369-14\">The plaintiff testified that he paid the plaintiff $806.75 in cash, and $762 by a due-billj these sums including the purchase-money and some expenses. He said also: \u201cMr. Morrow called at my office and told me he had one-sixteenth of the Davis &amp; Porter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>farm in Ohio; that he had come into possession of this one-sixteenth by Mr. Fowler being unable to spare the money to pay for it. He wanted me to take it. Told him I did not want it at that time; that I had invested in that kind of stock as much as I could spare for the present. He told me he had purchased that expressly for my use, and paid the cash for it to Mr. Fowler. I asked him to say that upon his word of honor, and I would take it off his hands. I asked him if all of the stockholders had purchased on the same terms, cash, and he allowed that they had, and that I was on the ground floor with the rest of them. He kindly offered to favor me with time on part of it, if I could not spare the money. I accepted that offer, and gave him my due-bill for the balance as above mentioned. He told me I was the owner of one-sixteenth of the whole purchase-money of the farm. After the receipt was given for the purchase-money, he called my attention that there was something to be paid for my share of expenses, and some six or eight dollars were handed to him. Mr. Morrow told me the deed was in the possession of the company, and he would make the representation to the secretary, and have my one-sixteenth properly represented \u2014 as to my being an owner of one-sixteenth. He told me who the company were, and I also previously knew it from hearsay.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b370-6\">On cross-examination, he said: \u201c Had a previous conversation with defendant about this same thing. At this conversation previously, I made no complaint to Mr. Morrow, but jocularly remarked to him and Mr. Horner that they had not given me an opportunity to purchase an interest in this farm. Mr. Morrow offered to get me a share, if an opportunity would arise. Told him not to do so, as I did not want any. Morrow told, at the conversation in my shop, that the deed was in the possession of the company. He said this receipt was the same as issued to all the others. * * * The only proof I Had of Morrow reporting me as a,n owner to the.company, was a notice, a month or two after-wards, to attend a meeting of the company, which I did.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b370-7\">David Hutchison testified \u201c that $10,000 of the purchase-money had been paid, each one of the purchasers having paid his proportionate share. The defendant declared in the compa.ny that he had sold his interest, and did not care whether they paid the balance of the purchase-money or not.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b370-8\">There was other evidence in corroboration of the plaintiff\u2019s testimony.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b370-9\">The plaintiff gave in evidence the record of the proceedings in Ohio, under which the land was sold, and rested.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b370-10\">The defendant testified that he paid the whole amount for his share except $190. He purchased Fowler\u2019s interest, and gave in evidence an assignment from Fowler to himself, and also a receipt from Davis &amp; Porter for $1562 in full for one-sixteenth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>* * * on account of one share that T. W. Fowler subscribed for on the original purchase.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b371-6\">The defendant gave evidence by several witnesses as well as by his own testimony in contradiction of the evidence of the plaintiff. The plaintiff in rebuttal called D. W. C. Carroll, who testified:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b371-7\">\u201c I have a very faint recollection of something occurring between Rees and Morrow about this matter in Horner\u2019s office. We had a general war of words between the parties. It was while these meetings were going on. After considerable talking, we all, as one man, charged Mr. Morrow as not acting right towards the stockholders. Can\u2019t remember what was said between Rees and Morrow. The talk was general. To the best of my knowledge, Mr. Rees charged him with a breach of faith in regard to the selling of this one-sixteenth. Mr. Rees understood we were all paying up together, whereas, he was the only one who had paid up. Recollect' nothing else. Both were excited, using strong language. There was a -general difficulty amongst the stockholders at the time.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b371-8\">A. Becker testified: \u201cWas present; at the last meeting I attended, general dissatisfaction amongst the stockholders. Rees told Mr. Morrow they had known each other for so long, and he had confidence in his word; but that he had falsely represented the payment of the one-sixteenth of the property. Mr. Morrow told him he had his proper receipt. Mr. Rees' told him it was worthless, and that he would mak.e him suffer for it. They were angry. All were dissatisfied at that meeting.\u201d ' -</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b371-9\">The plaintiff testified: \u201c Complained to Morrow, at Horner\u2019s office, the first time I heard that this claim was against the property. Asked him for an explanation as to his false representations to me. He said he had paid for the interest in full. Asked him why he had represented the deed in the hands of the company. He made me an indifferent reply, and that brought on angry words. Asked him if he was going to repay me my money. He said he could not do that.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b371-10\">The plaintiff submitted, amongst others, this point, which was affirmed:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b371-11\">\u201c 3. If the jury believe, from the evidence, that at the time the plaintiff paid the defendant for said one-sixteenth interest in the land, the defendant stated and represented to the plaintiff that his co-purchasers had paid up their shares in full, and that the company had procured the deed for the same, and that the defendant purchased on said representation, and that said representation was untrue, that then the plaintiff is entitled to 'recover back the purchase-money with interest.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b371-12\">The following are points submitted by the defendant with their answers:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b371-13\"><em>5, </em>In order to rescind the contract, and enable the plaintiff to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>recover back Ms purcbase-money, he was bound either to demand a return of his purchase-money, and offer a re-transfer to the defendant of the said one-sixteenth interest in the land, or to give defendant unequivocal notice of his election to rescind the contract ; and this he was bound to do promptly after he had discovered all the facts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b372-6\">Answer: \u201cAffirmed.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b372-7\">7.

It was an action of assumpsit brought to recover back the purchase-money paid for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>an interest in a contract for a farm in Ohio, on the ground of fraud. Nothing is certainly better settled in this state than that it is necessary in order to sustain such an action to show an actual rescission by the party defrauded, notice of the rescission to the other party and in general an offer to return the subject, unless indeed it is utterly worthless at the time, so as to put the vendor in <em>statu </em>quo: Pearsoll <em>v. </em>Chapin, 8 Wright 9; Babcock <em>v. </em>Case, 11 P. F. Smith 427 ; Patton <em>v. </em>Burkholder, M. D., May 1871. Opinion filed, October 4th 1871 (antea, p. 248). The plaintiff in error complains in his fourth specification, that the learned judge below in affirming the plaintiff\u2019s third point \u2014 in substance that if the jury believed the alleged fraud the plaintiff could recover\u2014 overlooked and in effect denied this well-settled rule. If this point had stood by itself it would undoubtedly have left the instruction to the jury open to this objection. But we must take the affirmance in connection with the answers given by the learned judge to the defendant\u2019s fifth and seventh points. By the fifth the defendant requested the court to instruct the jury, <em>\u201c </em>that in order to rescind the contract and enable the plaintiff to recover back his purchase-money,,he was bound either to demand a return of his purchase-money and offer a re-transfer to the defendant of the said one-sixteenth interest in the land, or to give defendant unequivocal notice of his election to rescind the contract; and this he was bound to do promptly after he had discovered all the facts.\u201d It is unnecessary to inquire whether under the circumstances of this case, a rescission did not <em>ipso facto </em>revest the interest in the defendant without any re-transfer or return of the receipt. The learned judge without qualification affirmed the defendant\u2019s point, and it surely cannot lie in his mouth to object or to allege that inasmuch as it was in' the alternative it was inaccurate and that the judge should have gone further than he was requested. The answer to the plaintiff\u2019s third point was therefore qualified by the answer to the defendant\u2019s fifth point, and both being taken together there was no error of which the defendant had any right to complain. The law was given to the jury just as he requested it to be. By the seventh point of the defendant the court were asked to charge \u201c that the declarations made by the plaintiff to the defendant at the meeting in August 1865, as testified by Carroll, Becker and the plaintiff, did not amount to a rescission of the contract.\u201d . This the court refused, but left it to the jury to determine. So that the only question fairly presented upon,this record is whether the declarations here referred to did amount to sufficient evidence of a rescission to be submitted to the jury. Rees, the plaintiff, testified distinctly that in that conversation he asked Morrow, the defendant, if he was going to repay him his money. Morrow said he could not do that. Now this was certainly evidence of rescission. What could be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>more unequivocal than a distinct demand for tbe return of the purchase-money? Though neither of the other two witnesses testify with the same distinctness to this demand, yet there is nothing in their testimony which absolutely contradicts it, and if there was it would not be any the less a question for the jury. They both agree that the parties were excited and that strong language was used. Carroll says that' Rees charged Morrow with a breach of faith, and Becker says that when Morrow told Rees that he had his proper receipt, Rees replied that it was worthless and that he would make him suffer for it. The question then was fairly and properly submitted to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">The second and third assignments of error have not been pressed, as indeed they could not be with any show of reason, and the remaining ones are disposed of by the considerations which have been presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
