A. Leavitt, attorney and agent of Cooley, and witness then received notice that the owner of the premises was to collect the rents, and that his firm were to be thereafter Cooley\u2019s tenants ; the persons occupying the part leased to defendants moved out about May 1st, and afterwards the key was in Richards\u2019s office; the plaintiffs abandoned the building about the spring of <em>1861; </em>the plaintiffs collected the rents from November 1858, until May 1861; G.

M. Richards Jewelry Company was the tenant of the whole upper part of the building ; they gave it up in June or July 1861. * * * Richards took me around the building and put me in possession of it,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b56-6\">The third cross-interrogatory was: \u201c If to the defendant\u2019s third interrogatory you have stated that the surrender of the lease and assignment of the rents therein assigned, took place, state particularly the names of the tenants of the plaintiffs at that time; the portions of the buildings each tenant respectively occupied; what rents they paid; how much they owed, and what rents and from whom due were so assigned. If either the surrender of the lease or the assignments of the rents were in writing, produce them, and annex them to your deposition; state in whose presence they or either of them were executed, and. by whom. Was any surrender ever made by the plaintiffs, or any person acting under their authority, to James E. Cooley or any person of the premises rented by defendants during the continuance of their term, viz., from February 1st 1853 to May 1st 1862 ? Did the said plaintiffs ever assign to James E. Cooley or any person the rent due by the defendants for the five last quarters of their term, viz., from February 1st 1861 to May 1st 1862.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b56-7\">In answer to this cross-interrogatory the witness gave the names of the tenants, &amp;c., and said:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b56-8\">\u201c I do not know how much they owed. The assignment which I will produce will show what rents were assigned. The only paper I have is the assignment referred to. The paper is signed by the H. M. Richards Jewelry Company. That is all I remember about it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b56-9\">\u201cIn addition to the paper referred to, Mr. Richards took me through the building, and p\u00fat me in possession of it. He introduced me to all the tenants who were there. This was in June or July 1861. Previous to this time I had nothing to do with the building except to collect the rent of the upper part of the building from the plaintiffs, whose lease expired in May 1862. From the time of the surrender mentioned, in June or July 1861, to May 1862, I acted as landlord of the premises. The whole upper part of the building as rented by the plaintiffs was put in my possession on the time mentioned, according to the paper and the personal surrender. The paper is the only assignment I have. But in giving me possession of the building at the time mentioned, I should think he did assign the rent due by the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b56-10\">\u201c Mr. Richards put me in possession of that building from 1st May 1861 to 1st May 1862, and any rents accruing during that period I should certainly have collected, if I could. For <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>the quarter previous to 1st May 1861,. I considered that covered\u2019 by the assignment, both written and personal. The assignment was made to me as agent for James E. Cooley. I think it was so expressed in the paper. Messrs. Pratt &amp; Reath, the defendants, were not tenants during those five quarters; that is, were not occupants.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b57-6\">The plaintiffs objected to the admission of the answer to the 3d cross-interrogatory. The answer was excluded and a bill of exceptions sealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b57-7\">The court instructed the jury \u201cto find for the plaintiffs for the full amount of their claims, as there was no evidence of a surrender.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b57-8\">The verdict was for the plaintiffs for $2956.65.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b57-9\">The defendants removed the case to the Supreme Court, and assigned for error the rejection of the evidence offered and the charge of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b57-10\"><em>S.

St. p. 134, \u00a7 6), and consequently the parol surrender here was perfectly valid and good.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"Axe\">It is not within the province of a court to say whether a given offer would actually prove the fact it was offered to prove, provided its tendency be to prove the fact. If it, with other facts in the case, tend to establish a result matei\u2019ial to be established by the party offering it, it should be admitted, and go to the jury. It is for them to pass on it under instructions from the court. <em>Bespondeant facto jur atores.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b58-10\">In the case in hand the letters of the defendants transmitted by mail to their landlord, H. M. Richards, offering to surrender the room in the building he had leased from Cooley and to them, his silence, and non-claim for rent for seven years, was, with the testimony of Leavitt, important to go to the jury on the question of a surrender in fact by Richards, the plaintiffs\u2019 landlord, and its acceptance by the paramount landlord, Cooley. There was proof that the plaintiffs had failed and surrendered to H. M. Richards, and that he surrendered to Cooley. Leavitt, whose testimony was rejected, says: \u201c Richards took me through the building and put me in possession.\u201d \u201c The whole upper part of the building was put in my possession at the time mentioned (June or July 1861), according to the paper and personal surrender.\u201d \u201cMr. Richards put me in possession of that building from 1st of May 1861 to 1st of May 1862.\u201d \u201c From the time of the surrender mentioned, in June or July 1861 to May 1862, I acted as landlord of the premises.\u201d \u201c The front room in the third story of that building (the room of Pratt, Reath &amp; Co.) was vacant in the month of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>May or June 1861. I had authority to let it, whenever it was vacant, to any person I chose.\u201d Leavitt was Cooley\u2019s agent, not the defendants\u2019. Surely this was evidence on the question of a surrender accepted from defendants by Richards, and a surrender by him to the paramount landlord for himself and for the jewelry company, likewise accepted. If the surrender was an accomplished fact for the time the lease had to run, which was about a year, I cannot see wherein the Statute of Frauds had anything to do with it. If there was a surrender and acceptance, the lessee\" would be estopped from claiming rent while he held the premises. These plaintiffs are, we think, in this category. If their lease was taken off their hands, what right have they to claim rent for the premises ? They were no longer landlords. In fact, their surrender acquitted them of rent, as it did their lessees. Now we say this being the appearance of the case as it is presented here, we think the learned judge should have admitted the testimony, and then both fact and law would have been eliminated properly and satisfactorily. We think the defendants were very likely damaged by the ruling of the learned judge; and that the testimony offered should have been admitted and then probably there would have been no room for the peremptory direction to find for the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">Judgment reversed, and <em>venire de novo </em>is awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
