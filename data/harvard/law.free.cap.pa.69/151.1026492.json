The stock of said defendant was duly assessed by the assessor of the borough of Mifflintown for the year 1870, for state and county taxes, at the sum in the aggregate of $1750, and the plaintiff laid an assessment of one-half per cent, on the said sum of $1750, as a borough tax for the repairs of the streets, &amp;c., in said borough for 1870, making a tax of $8.75 on said stock.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b152-8\">\u201c The question for the court is, whether under the provisions of the several tax laws of Pennsylvania bridge stock is taxable for borough purposes or not; if the court should be of opinion that it is, judgment to be entered in favor of the plaintiff for the sum of $8.75; but if the court should be of opinion that it is not so taxable, judgment to be entered in favor of the defendant for costs.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b152-9\">The court (Graham, P.

The question in that case was, whether, under the taxing power given by the Act of the 3d of April 1851, Pamph. L. 322, moneys, <em>stocks </em>and bonds are taxable for borough purposes; and it was held that the words \u201c all property,\u201d in the sentence giving the power of taxation, refer solely to such an estate or interest as one may have in lands or goods subject to manual occupation, and consequently that moneys, &amp;c., are not taxable. The very question presented by the record in this case was, therefore, decided in that, though it is true that the liability of stocks to taxation for borough purposes was not specially discussed by the judge who delivered the opinion. But the judgment entered in the ease shows that stocks were regarded by the court as equally exempt from taxation as moneys or bonds. We need not repeat the argument in support of the construction given to the words \u201c all property \u201d as found in the act. It is sufficient to say that it must have expressed the legislative intention, and the will of the people, or the act as thus interpreted, would not have remained unchanged for so long \u00e1 period. The construction given to it has become fixed and settled, and it is now too late to attempt to change it.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
