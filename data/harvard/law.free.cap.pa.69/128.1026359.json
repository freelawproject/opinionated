In 1794 a tract of 400 acres in Woodberry township was warranted in the name of \u201cDaniel Kritler/' and surveyed as 461 acres. It was assessed in Frankstown (cut off from Woodberry) till 1846 (from 1838 in the name of \u201cDaniel Kladder\u201d) and the taxes paid by the owner. Blair township was afterwards erected from Frankstown, and the tract continued to be assessed in Blair in the name of \u201cKritler,\u201d the owner still paying the taxes. After 1846 a tract of 230 acres was assessed in Frankstown in the name of \u201c Klad~ der,\u201d and another of 230 acres in the same name in Huston, which had been cut off from Woodberry. The 230 acre tract in Frankstown was sold for taxes: the purchaser entered on the tract in Blair, claiming that it was the tract he had bought. <em>Held, </em>as matter of law, that there was no evidence of the identity of the Frankstown 230 acres with Blair tract.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b128-10\">2.

Forbes had the Kritler tract put on the seated list. Plaintiff gave evidence that there was no \u201cKladder\u201d tract in that vicinity; but that there were two about three miles distant, one in the name of Daniel Kladder, and the other in the name of Jacob Kladder. The defendant\u2019s theory was that the one half of the tract, 230 acres, was regularly assessed in Frankstown township, and the other half in Huston or Taylor; that the assessment of the 230 acres in Frankstown sold to him, was a regular assessment of the 461 acre tract warranted in the name of Daniel Kritler.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b130-9\">Judge Taylor charged</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b130-10\">* * * \u201c But the question still arises, is the assessment of Daniel Kladder as containing 230 acres in Frankstown township, a regular assessment of Daniel Kritler, containing 491 acres and 97 perches, shown to lie in Blair township ? Is it, upon the face of the assessment, the same tract ? Is it, upon any fair inference that can be drawn from all that appears on the books, or in the evidence, the same land ? If it was the same land, the land upon which the cutting was done, that was assessed and sold under the other name, and that made apparent by sufficient evidence, then the'sale would vest the title in the defendant. [It is the land that is taxed and sold; but the land cannot be correctly taxed and sold under any name or designation. It must be assessed in some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>name by which the tract is known \u2014 some name connected with it, or some ownership of it, so as to identify it and give not only the owner notice but inform bidders what tract is intended to be sold. There must be some such identification.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b131-5\">\u201cNow, is this tract identified by name in the assessment? Daniel Kladder is an entirely different name from Daniel Kritler. Some difference in the spelling of a name is of but little consequence ; and there are some variations in the assessment of this\" Kritler traced in Huntingdon county down to 1837, where it occurs sometimes Kritler, and once Krydler, and again Kritler. These variations do not materially change the name, it being still <em>idem sonans. </em>\u2022 But Kladder and Kritler are as essentially different names as any other words of two syllables beginning and ending with the same letters. They are not <em>idem sonans. </em>There is nothing in the sound of one that could suggest the other. They are different names. Then again, while it is a different name, the assessment was of a tract of different quantity, and as lying in another township. Now, in all this, there is an entire absence of every element of identification.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b131-6\">\u201c It is answered, however, that going back to the assessment of the Kritler tract to Dr. Shoenberger in Huntingdon county, it is discovered that although from the date of Hartzell\u2019s deed down to 1837, the tract was represented as Kritler, yet the last two years it had been changed to Kladder, and that the certified list from the assessment of 1846 shows that it was introduced into the commissioners\u2019 office of this county as Kladder, and first put in taxation here as Kladder. But a previous assessment of a tract, properly or improperly made, does not do away with the necessity of a proper designation of it at the time it is sold; some designation that indicates in the assessment itself to the owner or purchaser what tract it is; either from its own name or the name of some owner. How it was assessed on some former occasion, correctly or incorrectly, is not sufficient to make out its identity.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b131-7\">\u201cBut upon this subject we find the commissioners here were not laboring under any mistake, or at least the mistake of supposing that Daniel Kladder, 230 acres in Frankstown township, was the same and identical with Daniel Kritler, 461 acres and 97 perches, in Blair township. Their mistake, if it was a mistake, evidently was in supposing that there were two tracts represented by these different names, as of the different quantities and in the different localities. For, in 1847, the first year after the erection of this county, they assessed Daniel Kritler, 400 acres in Blair township, where it belongs. * * * That the commissioners or assessor should have stumbled by chance upon a correct name in this way, so as to get it letter for letter, is not supposable. It is only to be accounted for on the supposition that they had ascertained and knew the true name of the tract. This mark of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>identity is most convincing. Besides it is in the same township where it is represented to be, and there continues to be assessed from 1847 down to 1854, and as the books show the taxes all the time paid for seven years after the erection of the county, the first seven years of the existence of the county as a county. * * *</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AW3\">\u201c It will be remembered, also, that during the same years prior .to the sale ; 1846-7-8-50-51 \u2014 at least down to 1851 \u2014 the same commissioners were taxing and assessing Daniel Kladder as lying in Erankstown township. Now, could this be accounted for on any other hypothesis than that the commissioners understood, believed, and treated Daniel Kladder as a different tract from Daniel Kritler ? Is it not plain, taking all the facts together, can there be a doubt that the commissioners were led into the error, if it was an error, and acted under it all through, of supposing that they had two tracts at least, represented by these names, to deal with, if not more ? * * * * * *</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b132-6\">[\u201c The question of identity is generally a question of fact, to be decided by the jury. It is to be determined by the jury when there are facts upon which the question should be submitted. If it were so submitted, in view of the facts in evidence already stated and discussed, and the further fact that the commissioners after-wards took back a treasurer\u2019s deed to Mr. Cresswell for the Daniel Kladder tract, having a note put on the book, which stands there, that the tract had no existence; it seems to us so perfectly plain that the commissioners thought they were dealing with two tracts \u2014 that they thought they were assessing another tract of land distinct from this one when they were assessing and selling the Daniel Kladder \u2014 that we do not see how you could have a doubt upon the question.\u201d]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b132-7\">[\u201cWe are, however, constrained to say to you that we regard the Philadelphia case reported in 6 P. E. Smith, 13 Wright, as establishing a proper and necessary rule; one that is calculated to insure reasonable accuracy on the assessment and sale of unseated lands for taxes, and to protect all the parties interested against the consequences of loose and careless practice; and as applicable to this case. And we accordingly instruct you that Daniel Kladder, 230 acres, in Erankstown township, does not designate Daniel Kritler, a tract of different quantity, shown to be in another township; and that there is nothing in the evidence which aids the identification ; and, therefore, we say to you, as matter of law, that the defence on this -ground fails, and that your verdict must be for the plaintiff.\u201d] ******</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b132-8\">The verdict was for the plaintiff in each case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b132-9\">The defendant removed the records to the Supreme Court, and assigned the parts of the charge in brackets for error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b132-10\"><em>S.

It had been assessed in that name for many years in Blair township and taxes paid upon it by Dr. Shoenberger, and after his death by those who succeeded to his title. It was therefore a well-known tract situate in that township, and the same land without dispute upon which the alleged trespass was committed. The defendant attempted to show title in himself, by proving a sale for taxes of an unseated tract of land assessed in the name of Daniel Kladder, containing 230 acres, in Frankstown township. The burthen of proof was on the defendant to show the identity of the tract sold \u2014 that it was the same as the well-known tract in the warrant name of Daniel Kritler of 461 acres 97 perches lying in Blair township. The judge below held that there was nothing in the names which could identify them as one and the same tract on the principle of <em>idem sonans, </em>and therefore identification must be derived from other sources. The quantity of land in each, and the townships, afforded no means of identification, and that there was no other evidence which under the circumstances of the cause could warrant the conclusion, that the Daniel Kladder tract of 230 acres in Frankstown township was the Daniel Kritler tract of 461 acres in Blair township. In such a case it would require very clear and satisfactory evidence that they were the same. The tract owned by Dr. Shoenberger was assessed in its true name in Blair township for many years before the sale, and he had paid .taxes always for it there. The division of the township had taken place in 1846, and his land was assessed in Blair township ever afterward. But the defendant relied on the fact that the land had been assessed in the name of Daniel Kladder in Frankstown township before 1847, and in and after that year that 230 acres were assessed in the same name in Frankstown township, and 230 acres assessed in that name in Huston township which had been cut off from Woodberry township in 1846, making up the whole of the Daniel Kritler tract. Had not the whole of the Daniel Kritler warrant been taxed in its true name in Blair township where it actually lies, and the owner of it been accustomed to pay the taxes of the tract as in that township, there might be a color for the argument that the tract sold was the same tract as the Kritler tract. But the commissioners cannot thus tax the whole tract in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>its proper name and quantity in its proper township, and tax it also in two parts in two other townships, where it does not lie. This would mislead everybody \u2014 owner,, treasurer and purchaser. Now when the tract is found assessed in its proper township for years and taxes paid for it as there, to hold that a former misnomer of the tract which had dropped out of memory for many years, would justify a sale of one half of it by that misnomer in a different township, and of the other half by the same misnomer in a third township, is monstrous. If such loose proceedings can strip a man of his property, there is no safety. This case is governed by the principles laid down in the case of The City of Philadelphia <em>v. </em>Miller, 13 Wright 440, reaffirmed in Lyman <em>v. </em>City of Philadelphia, 6 P. F. Smith 488, and also in Glass <em>v. </em>Gilbert, 8 Id. 266. We agree with the court below that under the circumstances of this case there was no sufficient evidence from which the jury could infer that the sale of the Daniel Kladder tract of 230 acres in Frankstown township, could carry the title of the Daniel Kritler tract of 461 acres in Blair township.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">The judgment is therefore affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
