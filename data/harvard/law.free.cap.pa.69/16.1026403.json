Soullier owned a lot in Philadelphia, and died there in 1821, leaving heirs residing in Prance: \u2014 they had agents in Philadelphia who leased the lot: the city filed a claim for paving, under which the lot was sold in 1864. At the time of the sale one of the heirs was a minor, the others were of age. <em>Held, </em>that under the saving of minors\u2019 rights, in the Act of April 16th 1840, the interest of the minor was not divested, but that the interests of the others were, although it was a proceeding <em>in rem.</em></headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b16-25\">2.

Kern, for a lot of land on Race street, Philadelphia. Jean M. Soullier became the owner of the premises in 1809, and died in 1821. After his death F. A. Raybold, Esc]., as the agent for his heirs, who resided in France, leased the premises. Upon Mr. Raybold\u2019s death W. E. Whitman, Esq., became the agent, and on the 26th of December leased to W. B. Wolfe and S. P. Willbank; these lessees put <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>Patrick Kereven into possession of the lot as their tenant. On the 13th of October 1860, the city of Philadelphia filed a claim in the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia for $10.44, for paving, against the lot, in the name of \u201c Patrick Curvan, owner, or reputed owner, or whoever may be owner.\u201d On the 14th of February 1863, a <em>scire facias </em>was issued on the claim; to this writ the sheriff returned \u201c Made known by posting and publishing <em>see. leg.\u201d </em>On the 30th of May judgment was entered for the city for want of an affidavit of defence for $12.32. On the 4th of January 1864, the premises were sold by the sheriff under this judgment to the defendant for $400, and the sheriff\u2019s deed to him acknowledged June 4th 1864. None of the decedent\u2019s heirs ever resided in the United States. On the trial, January 10th 1870, before Hare, P. J., the plaintiff gave evidence of the title in J. M. Soullier, and of his death, as above stated; that plaintiffs were his heirs at law; that Henri Edmund Soullier, one of them, had been born September 17th 1843; and rested.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b17-6\">The defendant having given in evidence the proceedings under which the lot had been sold, the plaintiff in rebuttal offered to, prove that Mr. Whitman, as agent for the heirs, had never received notice of the paving or of the filing of the claim for it; that Kereven, the tenant, did not know of paving done or to be done to the lot: also what price the defendant paid'for the premises at sheriff\u2019s sale and what negotiations had been had with him to redeem the premises.

If his claim be not made before sale, the sale is good and passes title to the purchaser as well against minors as adults. An exemption or privilege under the law must be claimed at the proper time; omission to do so allows the general provisions of the law to take their course with the same force and effect as if there were no exemption or privilege: Hartman <em>v. </em>Ogborn, 4 P.

Rep. 449.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"AhL\">The opinion of the court was delivered, October 9th 1871, by</p>\n<author id=\"Ate\">Williams, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AFK\">There was no error in refusing to charge, as requested in the plaintiffs\u2019 first point, that if one of the joint owners of the premises, for which this action was brought, was at the time of the sheriff\u2019s sale a minor, then the sale was invalid, and passed no title to the purchaser, and the plaintiffs are entitled to recover. It is true that the judgment on which the sale was made was a judgment <em>in rem. </em>But it does not follow that if the sale did not divest the title of the minor, that it did not pass the title of his co-tenants who were <em>sui juris. </em>It would have divested the title of all the owners, whether adults or minors, if it were not for the proviso in the Act of April 16th 1840, \u00a7 10, Pamph. L. 413, which declares \u201c that no property owned by minors shall be sold under the provisions of this act, until the expiration of two years from the time the said minor shall come of age.\u201d The argument that because the judgment is <em>in rem </em>nothing but the whole property bound by it could be sold, and as the minor\u2019s interest therein could not be sold under the provisions of the act, therefore the interest of the adult owners could not be sold, is more specious than sound. If the proceeding is <em>in rem </em>it is wholly statutory and may be moulded and changed by the legislature at their will, and there is nothing in the provision, forbidding the sale of the property of a minor <em>\u201c </em>until the expiration of two years from the time he shall come of age,\u201d which forbids, by implication, the sale of the undivided interest of an adult owner in the property bound by the lien. The object of the legislature in passing the act, was to protect the estates of minors, and to prevent their sacrifice at judicial sales \u2014 not to hinder and embarrass the city in the collection of its municipal claims against the property of adult owners. There is no more reason for exempting from sale during the minority of one of the co-tenants, the interest of an adult co-tenant, than there would be in exempting for the same period the property of such adult if he were the sole tenant or owner; nor would any injustice necessarily be done by allowing the sale of the adult owner\u2019s interest-before any sale could be made of the minor\u2019s interest under the provisions of the act. As the act forbids the sale of the minor\u2019s interest, the court would doubtless, on the applica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>tion of the adult co-tenant, enjoin the sale on the payment of his proportion of the lien or claim, leaving the residue a charge upon the minor\u2019s interest and to be paid out of it. But whether so or not, there is nothing in the language of the proviso in question which countenances the doctrine contended for by the learned counsel of the plaintiffs, that there can be no sale of any interest in the property bound by the lien, so long as the sale of the minor\u2019s interest is forbidden. The court below was therefore right in refusing to charge as requested in the plaintiffs\u2019 first point.</p>\n<p id=\"b20-6\">Nor was there any error in declining to charge as requested in the plaintiffs\u2019 second point. If the Court of Common Pleas had jurisdiction of the claim on which the sale was made, as it unquestionably had, under the express provisions of the Paving Act, then the judgment, until reversed or set aside, is conclusive that the paving for which the claim was filed, was authorized by the city of Philadelphia; and the judgment, if irregular or erroneous, cannot be collaterally questioned or impeached. The court, therefore, rightly refused to submit to the jury the question whether the paving for which the claim was filed was authorized by the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b20-7\">The third, fourth and fifth assignments were not pressed on the hearing, and it needs no argument to show that the offers of evidence embraced in them were properly rejected. If the facts offered to be shown were true, they would be of no avail to the plaintiffs in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b20-8\">But there was error in instructing the jury to find a verdict for the defendant. There was evidence tending to show that Henri Edmond Soullier, one of the plaintiffs, was a minor at the time of the sale; and if so, under the provisions of the act we have been considering, his interest was not divested by the sale; and the court should have submitted the case to the jury, with the instruction that, if they found that he was a minor at the time of the sale, then the sale as it respects his interest was void, and he was entitled to recover. Eor this error the judgment as to him must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b20-9\">Judgment reversed as to Henri Edmond Soullier and a <em>venire facias de novo </em>awarded; and as to the other plaintiffs in error named in the record the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
