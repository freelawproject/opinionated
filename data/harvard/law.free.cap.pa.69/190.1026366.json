In the estate of John Biddle, deceased.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b190-21\">The decedent died in 1847, having made a will dated June 14th of that year, and proved February 24th 1848, and owning both real and personal estate. After giving $500 to a granddaughter, and directing the payment of $150 to his daughter Christiana as compensation for labor for him, he gave, \u201cunto my five sons and four daughters all the residue of my real estate in equal portions, as follows : To my son John I give, &amp;c., the mansion tract I now <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>live on, &amp;c.; I further give, &amp;c., to my son John fourteen acres, &amp;c., which I value at seven dollars per acre,\u201d which he was to pay to the executors. <em>\u201c </em>I will, &amp;c., to my son Charles Biddle the residue of said tract, &amp;c., which I value to him at $35 per acre; I also give unto my son Charles fourteen acres mountain land, &amp;c., which I value at $7 per acre; and whatever these two tracts at the valuation amounts to more than his legacy, or one-eighth part of all my real and personal estate after deducting, &amp;c., he shall then pay to my executors for the share of his other brothers and sisters in the following manner,\u201d &amp;c. <em>\u201c </em>I will, &amp;c., my son Jacob a part of the Brooks tract of land, &amp;c., which I value to him at the sum of $5083.50, &amp;c.; the remainder of said Brooks tract, &amp;c., I bequeath to my daughter Drusanna, which I value at $4583.50,\u201d &amp;c. He gave to his son George one-eighth part of his real and personal estate, charged on Jacob\u2019s and Drusanna\u2019s tracts. He then gave to his daughter Christiana as follows:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b191-6\">\u201c I give, will and devise to my daughter Christiana the one-eighth part of all my real and personal estate, subject to the[before-mentioned devises, &amp;c. * * * It is my will that the legacy I have given to my daughter Christiana, shall remain in the hands of my hereinafter-named executors, so long as she remains single, and the interest payable to her each year, and on the event of her marrying, and she desiring to have her legacy, my hereinafter-named executors to pay it to her.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b191-7\">He then gave to his other children legacies, each one-eighth of his estate, and concluded:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b191-8\">\u201c The residue and remainder of all my personal and real estate not hereinbefore already disposed of, shall be sold by my hereinafter named executors, so soon after my death as can be done conveniently, and out of the proceeds thereof my hereinafter-named executors shall pay to Elizabeth Snowberger, &amp;e., Rachel Boyd, &amp;e., and to my daughter Christiana their several legacies, in the way and manner I have heretofore directed, in proportion as the same comes from the payments from my sons and sale of my real and personal property. It is further my will that if any of my sons and daughters die without lawful heirs, then in that case their portion reverts back to my heirs in common, share and share alike. And lastly, I appoint my sons Andrew and Charles Biddle, the executors of this my last will,\u201d &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b191-9\">Christiana subsequently married William Delaney. In February 1853, the executors filed their final administration account, by which it appeared that Mrs. Delaney\u2019s share of her father\u2019s estate under the will was $2283. She died September 1st 1856, and administration of her estate was granted to her husband.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b191-10\">On the 28th of January 1867, Delaney, as administrator, &amp;c., of his wife, presented a petition setting out the bequest to her and the other facts as above stated, and prayed the court to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>make a decree against the executors for the payment of the legacy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b192-6\">The executors answered amongst other things that Mrs. Delaney had been \u201cpaid in her lifetime the interest and all the principal of her additional legacy except about $500 or $550; that the said sums were paid her in accordance with the directions of said will, the interest payable to her each year while single, and the principal after her marriage as she desired and requested it; that she died on the day of A. D. 1855 or 1856, without lawful heirs, and the balance of said legacy remaining in hands of said executors was distributed and paid to the other heirs of John Biddle, deceased, share and share alike, as directed by testator.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b192-8\">By an amended answer the executors averred: that the balance of the legacy due to Christiana Delaney was tendered to her about April 2d 1856, in the presence of her husband, and that she refused to receive it, and said she desired it to remain in the hands of the executors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b192-9\">The matter was referred to A. S. Landis, Esq., as auditor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b192-10\">The evidence before him was that a considerable portion of the $2283, the amount of her legacy, had been paid to her before the final settlement of the executor\u2019s account in 1853; that shortly before her death, Charles, one of the executors, offered her the balance. She declined taking it; she shid she wanted it to stay in his hands, as she did not need it at the time.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b192-11\">Charles, the executor, testified, that on the'occasion spoken of, he paid her the interest then due her on the balance up to that date, and offered her the principal; she said she wished it to remain in the executors\u2019 hands where it was; he then offered her his note with security to close up the account, but she declined to take it. He testified that he had paid the money'out to the other heirs since her death.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b192-12\">The auditor, in concluding his report, in which he discussed the authorities and applied them to the facts, said:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b192-13\">\u201c The auditor is, therefore, of opinion that the balance of the legacy was vested in Christiana Delaney, the gift being limited over on an indefinite failure of issue, by operation of the rule of law in such cases; the gift over was void for remoteness, and it therefore passed and vested in her absolutely, and her administrator is entitled to receive the payment of the same with interest.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b192-14\">He accordingly reported that there was due from the executors to the estate of Mrs. Delaney on the 24th of March 1871, the sum of $1304.20. ^</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b192-15\">^ The executors filed exceptions to the report of the auditor. The Orphans\u2019 Court overruled the exceptions and confirmed the report.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b193-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>On appeal by the executors to the Supreme Court, they assigned the decree of confirmation for error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b193-6\"><em>H.

After her marriage the executors paid to her at her request two-thirds or more of the legacy, the remainder being suffered by her to remain in their hands. It is very clear that this bequest vested in Christiana an absolute estate in the personal, and since the Wills Act of 1833, a fee simple in the real estate. Indeed, the blending of the real and personal estate would have carried a fee simple before that act. The postponement of the payment of the principal until marriage did not detract from the absolute and vested character of her interest in the personalty. And clearly the trust in the executors, if any, ceased at marriage when she demanded payment. If the expression, \u201c and she desiring to have her legacy,\u201d at that time, might be deemed to vest in her a right of election merely, still the election was made according to the testimony, and she actually received from the executors two-thirds or more of the legacy after her marriage and before her death. The election to receive the legacy was therefore actually made. That part of the money remaining in the hands of the executors partook of the character of the whole, and was as truly and absolutely hers as the part she received. It would be difficult to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>separate the right of election into two parts. The legacy was a unit, and the election to receive it at marriage, was not divisible unless by her express agreement. Separation is therefore not to be inferred from the mere fact of the smaller part of the legacy being left in the hands of the executors. That must be deemed but a matter of convenience in the absence of an express arrangement otherwise. The whole legacy m\u00fcst therefore be considered as absolutely vested in her.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">This being personal estate, the subsequent clause in the will did not carry the legacy over to the right heirs of the testator on the death of Christiana without issue. That clause is in these words: \u201cIt is further my will that if any of my sons and daughters die without lawful heirs, then in that case their portion reverts back to my heirs in common, share and share alike.\u201d To give this clause any effect whatever, the words lawful heirs must mean lawful issue. This according to the authorities would convey a fee tail in the real estate, and an absolute estate in the personalty. The will of John Biddle was made and proved in 1847, before the act abolishing estates tail was passed. Though an estate for life may be limited in chattels with a remainder to others; yet there can be no limitation of chattels in fee or fee tail, so as to vest in the <em>heirs </em>of the tenant in fee or tail, an indefeasible title. The estate in the realty if entailed may be barred by deed in the manner provided by law; and the estate in the personalty becomes absolutely vested in the first taker: Amelia Smith\u2019s Appeal, 11 Harris 9; Mengel\u2019s Appeal, 11 P. F. Smith 248.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">Finding no error in the record, the decree of the Orphans\u2019 Court is affirmed, with costs to be paid by the appellants.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
