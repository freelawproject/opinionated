Homestead.\u2014 The husband has no power, directly or indirectly, to alienate property, a portion of the purchase money of which has not been paid, and which is occupied by his wife and himself as a homestead, unless his wife joins in the conveyance, or the same is done in good faith by the husband in settlement of the lien for unpaid purchase money.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b665-15\">2. Same.\u2014If the husband, who attempts without being joined by the wife to dispose of the homestead, under pretense of satisfying the claim for unpaid purchase money, acts in bad faith when no necessity for sale exists, and with the purpose to deprive his wife of her homestead right, his act conveys no title as against the wife to purchasers with notice.

Tried below before the Hon. I. B. McFarland.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b666-6\">The following statement of the case by appellant\u2019s counsel was adopted by appellee:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b666-7\">\u201cThis suit was filed in the district court of Washington county, 22d day of September, 1879, by Rachael Morris, a married woman, against her husband, Ben Morris (who refused to join her), and F. <em>&amp; </em>A. Geisecke, to recover from F. &amp; A. Geisecke her homestead, alleged to have been sold them by said Ben Morris without her consent. The defendant filed a general demurrer to plaintiff\u2019s amended and supplemental petitions, which was sustained by the court and judgment rendered for the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b666-8\">\u201cAppellant, the plaintiff below, alleged in her petition: That some time prior to January, 1878, she and her husband, Ben Morris, purchased a lot in Brenham from C. R. Breedlove, paying on the same something over $200, and executed their note for the balance of purchase money, $60; that they improved said lot and occupied the same as their homestead; that the said Ben Morris, in the spring of 1879, drove your petitioner from her homestead and refused to let her remain on the same with him; that some time in September, 1879, the said Ben Morris sold the lot and improvements to F. &amp; A. Geisecke for the sum of $150 (which was greatly below its real value), and made them a deed to the property. That the deed was made without the consent, against the will and over the protest of petitioner, and was not signed by her; that the note for $60 given to Breedlove had been before this time, reduced by payments to the sum of $40; that as soon as she heard of the sale of her said homestead and the taking up of the unpaid purchase money note by said Geiseckes, she immediately went to the Geiseckes and tendered them the balance of the purchase money on said lot.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b666-9\">\u201c That the said F. <em>&amp; </em>A. Geisecke conspired and combined with the said Ben Morris for the purpose of defrauding her of her homestead, and bought the same from the said Ben Morris at a price greatly below its real value, when they knew that she had refused to join her husband in the sale of said homestead, and that she notified the defendants before they purchased from Ben Morris that she would not join in the deed to her homestead.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b666-10\">\u201c C. R. Breedlove sold the property to appellant and her husband and took their note for $60 in part payment for same. Breedlove sold this note to E. P. Davis, and Davis to Geisecke, after he had purchased the property from Ben Morris.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b667-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number><em>W.

Geisecke were advised of the unwillingness of the appellant to the disposition of the property which the husband was seeking to make; they knew her rights therein, and yet, in the face of her protest, insisted upon consummating a contract, through the husband, by which the rights of the wife were to be destroyed; insisted upon paying money to the husband for the property, under circumstances which indicated to them that it was the intention of the husband to squander the little property which seems to have been acquired by the labor of the appellant, and thus defraud her.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">If it be conceived that the simple fact that a homestead has not been fully paid for deprives it of the homestead character and protection as against any person other than one holding a lien acquired prior to the time the property becomes the home, then such conception finds nothing in reason nor in the decisions of this court to rest on. Woolfolk <em>v. </em>Rickets, 41 Tex., 361.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">The petition states a good cause of action, and the demurrer should have been overruled and an inquiry made into the facts pleaded by the respective parties; and for the error of the court below in sustaining the demurrer the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-8\">Reveesed and bemanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-9\">[Opinion delivered January 25, 1884.]</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
