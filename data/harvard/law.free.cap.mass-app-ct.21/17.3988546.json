L. c. 265, \u00a7 26), the defendant filed a motion requesting postconviction relief pursuant to Mass.R.Crim.P. 30(a) and (b), 378 Mass. 900 (1979).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In his motion, the defendant claimed, among other things, that \u201c[ijmproper considerations played a part in the sentencing process in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>Amendment.\u201d After hearing, the Superior Court judge who had presided at the defendant\u2019s trial denied those aspects of the motion which came within Mass.R.Crim.P. 30(b).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The same judge, however, later ordered that the defendant\u2019s sentence on the kidnapping conviction be \u201c[rjevised and [r]evoked\u201d and reduced the term to be served from nine to ten years to three to four years. The judge did not make any findings or provide any reasons in support of his ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">The Commonwealth objected to the order revising that sentence and filed a timely notice of appeal. This court, after considering the record and briefs and hearing the arguments of counsel, remanded the case to the Superior Court and ordered the motion judge to provide a \u201cfuller explanation of his actions and state his reasons therefor.\u201d This court further ordered the motion judge to \u201cmake findings of fact on the question whether the defendant\u2019s motion (or any aspects thereof) properly falls within the purview of Mass.R.Crim.P. 30(a)\u201d and \u201cto identify specifically the evidence relied on in support of each particular finding.\u201d Upon remand, the motion judge disqualified himself from the case pursuant to S.J.C. Rule 3:09, Canon 3(C) (1) (a), as appearing in 382 Mass. 811 (1981). As a result, another judge of the Superior Court was appointed to address the remand order.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">In responding to the order, the second judge found that the defendant\u2019s motion was \u201cextremely vague and obscure in specifying the relief sought\u201d and noted that the grounds for relief \u201cappear to fall into two categories: matters relating to alleged trial errors . . . and matters relating to the sentence.\u201d As to the latter category, the judge observed that, while \u201ccounsel attempted to fit the \u2018sentencing\u2019 grounds under rule 30(a), there was only a very limited basis for such a contention.\u201d This limited basis, the judge determined, related to the motion judge\u2019s purported misapprehension, at the time of sentencing, that the applicable parole eligibility standards would soon be relaxed by the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">Even if we assume that the sentence was imposed under a misapprehension of the defendant\u2019s parole eligibility date, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>sentence was not subject to correction under Mass.R.Crim.P. 30(a). Rule 30(a) permits a defendant to seek the correction, <em>at any time, </em>of an illegal sentence. An \u201cillegal sentence\u201d is one that is in excess of the punishment prescribed by the relevant statutory provision or in some way contrary to the applicable statute. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>346 U.S. 502, 506 (1954); <em>Hill </em>v. <em>United States, </em>368 U.S. 424, 430 (1962); <em>Green </em>v. <em>United States, </em>274 F.2d 59, 60 (1st Cir. 1960) (all interpreting Fed.R.Crim.P. 35, from which Mass.R.Crim.P. 30(a) is drawn in part). See also Reporters\u2019 Notes to Mass.R.Crim.P. 30(a), Mass. Ann. Laws, Rules of Criminal Procedure at 482-483 (1979); Smith, Criminal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 2061 (2d ed. 1983). In <em>Hill </em>v. <em>United States, </em>368 U.S. at 430, the Supreme Court held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-5\">\u201cthe narrow function of Rule 35 is to permit correction at any time of an illegal <em>sentence, </em>not to reexamine errors occurring at the trial. . . . The sentence in this case was not illegal. The punishment meted out was not in excess of that prescribed by the relevant statutes . . . nor were the terms of the sentence itself legally or constitutionally invalid in any other respect.\u201d (Emphasis original.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">As in <em>Hill, </em>the punishment imposed in this case was not in excess of or contrary to the applicable statutory provision (G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 26). In short, the defendant\u2019s motion falls outside the scope of rule 30(a). Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lemay, </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 992, 993 (1981) (rule 30 relief is inappropriate where sentencing judge has not \u201cmisapprehended his power\u201d with respect to available sentences); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Lewis, 392 </em>F.2d 440, 441, 442 (4th Cir. 1968) (where judgment had been purportedly made under a \u201cmistaken impression\u201d that the relevant statute required pronouncement of the maximum term, the sentence might have been modified as one \u201cimposed in an illegal manner\u201d not as an illegal sentence); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hairston, </em>560 F. Supp. 481 (S.D. Ohio 1983) (sentences based upon \u201carguably faulty estimates\u201d of defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>ant\u2019s parole release dates not \u201cillegal\u201d). The issues raised by the defendant\u2019s motion, namely that the sentence was \u201cillegally imposed\u201d and inequitable, should have been raised in a motion filed under Mass.R.Crim.P. 29(a), 378 Mass. 899 (1979). It is plain that the instant motion was filed under rule 30(a) because the time restrictions of rule 29(a) could not be complied with. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Layne, </em>386 Mass. 291, 297 n.4 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">\n<em>Order allowing motion to revise and revoke sentence reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b37-14\"> The indictments arose from the defendant\u2019s shooting of two policemen and his kidnapping of an elderly lady during the course of his attempted evasion of capture.
