The controversy raises the sole issue whether certain ordinances and regulations promulgated thereunder, cited by the chief as the source of his authority, are in conflict with the city charter, relied upon by the mayor. If conflict exists, the charter controls. See <em>Clarke </em>v. <em>Fall River, </em>219 Mass. 580, 583 (1914). The complaints were consolidated, and on cross motions for summary judgment the judge concluded that the power claimed by both was vested in the chief and not the mayor. We affirm the judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>1. <em>The Charter and Ordinances.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">The charter of Chelsea is a special law, St. 1911, c. 680, Pt. II, the city never having adopted one of the charter forms provided for in G. L. c. 43. Section 3 of the charter provides, to the extent pertinent, that the \u201cgovernment of the city and the general management and control of all its affairs shall be vested in a single officer, to be called the mayor, and in a legislative body, to be called the board of aldermen.\u201d The powers of the mayor relevant to this controversy are set out in \u00a7\u00a7 50 and 51. Section 50 describes the mayor as the \u201cchief executive officer of the city\u201d and \u201cexcept as is otherwise provided herein,\u201d vests in the mayor \u201cexecutive powers\u201d which \u201cshall be exercised by him, either personally or through the several officers and boards in their respective departments under his general supervision and control.\u201d The chief of police is appointed by the mayor, subject to the approval of the aider-men, and holds office until a successor is appointed. See \u00a7 51. Ordinances are established by the board of aldermen, and once approved by the mayor under \u00a7 42,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201ccontinue in force until amended or repealed.\u201d \u00a7 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">Section 13-4 of the revised ordinances declares that the \u201cchief of police shall . . . have entire control of the [police] department, its officers and members, and of all constables and other officers when engaged in the service of the city, or when assigned by him to any special duty; subject, however, to the provisions of section [50] of the city charter.\u201d The chief is required by \u00a7 13-7 to enforce the ordinances and \u201corders of the mayor and board of aldermen.\u201d By \u00a7 13-9, power was conferred upon the chief to make \u201csuch rules and regulations for the conduct and control of the police department as he deems advisable, the same being subject to the approval of the mayor and board of aldermen.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">On February 23 and 25, 1976, the aldermen and mayor, respectively, approved rules and regulations which define the chief\u2019s responsibilities and powers. Included among those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>therein set out are designations of police officers to specific shifts, days off and job assignments, or, as characterized by the chief (and fairly, we think), the authority to \u201cmake daily operational decisions.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">2. <em>Discussion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">In determining whether the mayor\u2019s actions relative to the police department fall within the scope of the executive powers conferred upon him by \u00a7 50 of the charter, we apply well-established principles of statutory construction. It is our function to construe the charter and ordinances together so that they constitute a harmonious whole consistent with the purpose of their enactment. In so doing, we look first to the language of the pertinent provisions, keeping in mind that a literal construction will not be adopted \u201cwhen that construction would be inconsistent with other material provisions of the statute and would defeat the aim and object of the legislation.\u201d <em>Lexington </em>v. <em>Bedford, </em>378 Mass. 562, 570 (1979). See also <em>Registrar of Motor Vehicles </em>v. <em>Board of Appeal on Motor Vehicle Liab. Policies &amp; Bonds, </em>382 Mass. 580, 585 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">Pointing to \u00a7 50, the mayor contends that the city\u2019s executive powers were intended to vest exclusively in the mayor, as the \u201cchief executive officer of the city.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We think, however, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>any notion of exclusivity is dispelled by that part of \u00a7 50 which provides that executive powers vest in the mayor \u201cexcept as is otherwise provided herein.\u201d Section 57 of the charter, for example, confers upon the board of aldermen executive power similar to that granted the mayor under \u00a7 50, the power to make appointments. See <em>Bailen </em>v. <em>Assessors of Chelsea, </em>241 Mass. 411, 416 (1922). Additionally, the most common use of the term \u201cexecutive power\u201d is in contradistinction to legislative and judicial power. See <em>Selectmen of Milton </em>v. <em>District Court of E. Norfolk, </em>286 Mass. 1, 4-6 (1934), and cases therein discussed. In this sense, executive power indicates the authority to formulate general policy and to make decisions in furtherance of that policy. See <em>Yunitz </em>v. <em>Chelsea, </em>270 Mass. 179, 181 (1930).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Cf. <em>Rollins </em>v. <em>Salem, </em>251 Mass. 468, 471 (1925).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">Moreover, construing the term \u201cexecutive powers\u201d as meaning managerial powers in general, rather than in every detail, is consistent with \u00a7 3 of the charter, which, as earlier noted, places the \u201cgovernment of the city and the <em>general </em>management and control of all its affairs\u201d in the mayor <em>\u201cand </em>in a legislative body,\u201d the board of aldermen (emphasis supplied). The only specific power granted the mayor by the charter in respect to the chief of police is that found in \u00a7 51; the chief is appointed by the mayor (subject to the approval of the board of aldermen) who may also remove him \u201cfor such cause as he shall deem sufficient.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The remaining charter sections which speak to the powers of the mayor may be described as relating to the efficient and economical administration of the affairs of Chelsea.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>Although we respect the mayor\u2019s position of chief executive officer of the city, we see nothing in \u00a7\u00a7 50 or 51 which authorizes him to direct in every detail the day to day affairs of the police department. <em>Chief of Police of Medford </em>v. <em>City Manager of Medford, </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 415, 420-421 (1981), provides analogous support for our reading of the charter as consistent with the ordinances. There the ordinance provided that the \u201cchief of police \u2018shall be the head of the department and subject to the general supervision and control of the [c]ity [mjanager, shall have control of the department, its officers and members.\u2019\u201d Relying upon the \u201cbroad powers\u201d conferred upon him as \u201cchief administrative officer of the city\u201d under a Plan E form of charter, see G. L. c. 43, \u00a7\u00a7 103-106, the city manager claimed control of the chief and the department and attempted to reorganize the department in a manner which, much as in the present case, conflicted with the chief \u2019 s authority conferred by the ordinance. In resolving the \u201cpossible conflict of authority\u201d the court recognized the \u201cbroad authority of the city manager to set general policy to be carried out by the chief and to supervise and control his actions, but without going so far as to empower the city manager to exclude the chief entirely from the chain of command from the city manager to the department.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 421.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">We think it important to point out that, in reaching our conclusion, we have not considered the scope of the mayor\u2019s executive powers under the charter in any context other than as they relate to the specific ordinances relied upon by the chief in asserting his authority to assign members of the department to days off and to specific shifts and jobs. As those ordinances do not conflict with any of the mayor\u2019s executive powers conferred upon him by \u00a7\u00a7 50 and 51 of the charter, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>conclude that the specific authority here in dispute is vested in the chief by those ordinances.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b551-8\"> If not approved, the ordinance may nonetheless pass upon a vote of approval by \u201ctwo thirds of the members of the board\u201d of aldermen. \u00a7 42.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b552-8\"> More specifically, \u00a7 n.A of the Rules and Regulations for the Government of the Police Department of the city of Chelsea states that the chief is the \u201cfinal departmental authority in all matters of policy, operations, and discipline. He exercises all lawful powers of his office and issues such lawful orders as are necessary to assure the effective performance of the Department.\u201d Further particularization is found in \u00a7\u00a7 II.B(2), (3), (4), and (5), which speak to the chief\u2019s duty to \u201c[o]rganize, direct, and control all resources of the Department,\u201d \u201c[d]evelop the organizational structure of the Department in accordance with professional standards,\u201d \u201c[establish a routine of daily duties to be performed by officers as designated by him,\u201d and \u201c[a]ssign, detail or transfer any member or employee of the Department to or from any unit or assignment whenever he shall deem such action to be in the best interest of the efficiency, discipline or morale of the Department.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b552-9\"> We find it of no particular significance that the mayor is described in \u00a7 50 as the \u201cchief executive officer of the city.\u201d See 3 McQuillin, Municipal Corporations \u00a7 12.41 (3d ed. rev. 1982) (\u201cThe chief officer or executive and administrative head of a municipal corporation is commonly styled the mayor\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b553-6\"> In <em>Yunitz, </em>the court concluded that the fact that \u00a7 61 of the charter authorized the superintendent of public buildings to employ labor did not prevent the mayor from exercising his executive power \u00a7 50 \u201cto practice economy for the general welfare . . . [and] from exercising in good faith the highly important and laudable abolition of an unnecessary position within that department.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 181.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b553-7\"> By \u00a7 75 of the charter, G. L. c. 31, the civil service law, \u201cshall have full force, application and effect in the said city.\u201d As to how the civil service law applies to chiefs of police, see G. L. c. 31, \u00a7\u00a7 48 and 51.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b553-8\"> See <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Brady, </em>380 Mass. 480, 484 (1980) (\u201cThere is, of course, a \u2018maxim of statutory construction which suggests that a statutory expression <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>of one thing is an implied exclusion of other things omitted from the statute. \u2019 <em>Harborview Residents\u2019 Comm., Inc. </em>v. <em>Quincy Housing Authy., </em>368 Mass. 425, 432 [1975], and cases cited. However, as we noted in <em>Harborview, </em>\u2018the maxim is not to be followed where to do so would frustrate the general beneficial purposes of the legislation\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
