L. c. 94C, \u00a7 34) after a jury-waived trial in a District Court, at which the Commonwealth offered no evidence other than that which had been presented at the hearing on the defendant\u2019s motions to suppress items and statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>Our task has needlessly been made more difficult because the judge did not make any findings.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mattias, </em>8 Mass. App. Ct. 786,788 (1979). This failure, which is not in and of itself reversible error, requires us to engage in the unenviable task of analyzing \u201cthe record to see if the findings implicit in the judge\u2019s ruling are supported.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gaulden, </em>383 Mass. 543, 547 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">The arresting officer testified that he was on patrol in a marked police cruiser at approximately 9:30 p.m. on October 1,1983. He pulled into the parking lot of a liquor establishment and observed that one of the cars in the lot was occupied by the defendant, who was in the driver\u2019s seat, and a female passenger. The trooper testified that \u201c[w]hen I made eye contact with the defendant... I observed the defendant, Mr. O\u2019Con-nor, reaching down below the dash of the vehicle.\u201d At that point, the trooper testified that \u201cI stopped the cruiser and approached the vehicle. I opened up the door and had a conversation with Mr. O\u2019Connor.\u201d After opening the driver\u2019s door, the trooper observed a piece of glass with white powder on it on the floor of the vehicle. A search of the defendant and the area outside the vehicle yielded packets of a substance which proved, upon laboratory analysis, to be cocaine. The defendant was given his Miranda rights. \u201cHe stated he knew the young lady and picked her up. She was walking, he offered her a ride, and they went out to the vehicle and did a couple of lines of cocaine.\u201d The defendant also told the officer that he had thrown some of the cocaine outside the vehicle. Aside from the certificates of analysis, this testimony was the only evidence offered against the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">1. The trooper confirmed on cross-examination that he immediately opened the defendant\u2019s car door and thereafter talked with him and saw the cocaine.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cA police officer may stop a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>vehicle in order to conduct a threshold inquiry if he has a reasonable suspicion that the occupants have committed, are committing, or are about to commit a crime. His suspicion must be based on specific, articulable facts and reasonable inferences drawn therefrom. A hunch will not suffice.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wren, </em>391 Mass. 705, 707 (1984). By itself, an attempt to avoid contact with or observation by the police is not enough to justify a suspicion. <em>Id. </em>at 708 n.2. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bacon, </em>381 Mass. 642, 645-646 (1980); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thibeau, </em>384 Mass. 762, 763-764 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">The instant circumstances are controlled by <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Podgurski, </em>386 Mass. 385 (1982), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 1222 (1983). \u201cPrior to [opening the car door], the officer made no attempt to question or communicate with the defendant ] in any way, nor does the record disclose that he was warranted in taking reasonable precautions for his safety.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 390. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Silva, </em>366 Mass. 402, 407 (1974); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 476, 477-478 (1981). Contrast <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>407 U.S. 143, 147-148 (1972); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ortiz, </em>376 Mass. 349, 353 (1978); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sumerlin, </em>393 Mass. 127, 128-131 (1984), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 1193 (1985). Because the officer had no right to open the car door, the contraband which was discovered as a result of this action must be suppressed. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ferrara, </em>376 Mass. 502, 505 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">2. \u201cThe \u2018fruit of the poisonous tree\u2019 doctrine which forbids putting illegally seized evidence to any use applies to verbal statements as well as to tangible evidence.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Conway, </em>2 Mass. App. Ct. 547, 553 (1974), citing <em>Wong Sun </em>v. <em>United States, </em>371 U.S. 471, 485 (1963). See also <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>422 U.S. 590, 597-604 (1975); <em>Dunaway </em>v. <em>New York, </em>442 U.S. 200, 216-219 (1979). Because there would have been no occasion for a discussion about the cocaine between the trooper and the defendant if the trooper had not opened the defendant\u2019s car door and seen the white powder on the glass, it is plain that the defendant\u2019s statements resulted from \u201cexploitation of that illegality.\u201d <em>Wong Sun </em>v. <em>United States, supra </em>at 488; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Conway, supra </em>at 554. The statements must be suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>3. It is apparent that if the motions to suppress items and statements had been allowed the Commonwealth\u2019s case as presented would have been lacking in the proof essential to support conviction. \u201cThe defendant\u2019s motion for a required finding of not guilty must now be allowed.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thibeau, </em>384 Mass. at 765.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">\n<em>Verdict set aside.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"ANZK\">\n<em>Judgmentfor the defendant.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b425-7\"> We have said repeatedly that after the conclusion of the suppression hearing the motion judge should make findings. See Smith, Criminal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 1347 (2d ed. 1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b425-8\"> The order of these latter two events is unclear from the testimony. The sequence, however, has no bearing on our resolution of the pivotal issue on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
