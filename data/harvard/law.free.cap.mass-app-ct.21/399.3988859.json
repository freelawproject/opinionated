In its main purpose, the operation was successful. Subsequently, however, the plaintiff complained of loss of sensation in the fourth and fifth fingers of his left hand, evidently the manifestation of an ulnar nerve palsy. He brought the present action charging the defendants with having caused the condition by reason of their negligent practice in the conduct of the operation. More specifically, the plaintiff\u2019s claim was that his left arm was improperly positioned while he was under anesthesia on the operating table, with the result that the relevant nerve system was unduly compressed or stretched and thereby damaged.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (The plaintiff was an auto mechanic who had to work constantly with his hands.)</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">This medical malpractice action was fully tried in April-May, 1984, with testimony by the parties and by experts on either side. The jury found for the defendants.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> From the judgment, and the denial of his postverdict motion for a new trial, the plaintiff takes his appeal to this court. His chief contention is that the judge erred in dealing with the testimony by Dr. Gary H. Asher, the plaintiff\u2019s family physician, called as a witness on the part of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">After an episode of acute urine retention for which he was treated at. Nashoba Hospital emergency, the plaintiff in early September, 1978, was examined by Dr. Asher, who concluded that he was suffering from an enlarged prostate and advised him to see Dr. Rathore, a urologist. Dr. Rathore recommended the operation that was carried out on September 22. Dr. Asher attended the operation, serving for a fee as an assistant to Dr. Rathore at the latter\u2019s request (the usual arrangement when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>Dr. Rathore was operating on a patient referred to him by Dr. Asher). At a visit to Dr. Asher\u2019s office on October 16, the plaintiff complained of numbness which suggested to Dr. Asher a contusion of the left ulnar nerve. On October 20, the plaintiff had an office visit with Dr. Rathore; Dr. Rathore said the condition would probably go away in three months. Later, in January, 1979, Dr. Rathore suggested that the plaintiff call on Dr. Anthony R. M. Caprio, an orthopedic surgeon. Dr. Caprio\u2019s entry on his records of an examination of the plaintiff on January 22, 1979, recited that the plaintiff noticed numbness \u201c[ajfter he woke up from anesthesia\u201d on September 22;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201cImpression: Ulna [sz'c] nerve palsy.\u201d A copy of this entry was sent to Dr. Asher.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">1. We now approach Dr. Asher\u2019s testimony about a visit to his office on April 30, 1979. First we note that Dr. Asher, in the course of his testimony, stated that he observed nothing unusual, that he was aware of no problem, during the surgery; that \u201c[independent of Dr. Caprio,\u201d he did not feel he was competent to form an opinion about the cause of the plaintiff\u2019s condition; and that he did not know what caused the condition. However, counsel for the plaintiff sought to get in evidence Dr. Asher\u2019s entry for the April 30 visit which, besides noting the copy of the report received from Dr. Caprio, and stating that the condition was \u201cUlnar nerve palsy, questionably getting a little better,\u201d went on to say: \u201cPatient is informed that this is an unfortunate complication of his surgery from lying on the table with his arm in the wrong position and should not have happened.\u201d But, responding to the question whether he had told the plaintiff on April 30 how the injury occurred, Dr. Asher answered, \u201cNo.\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s counsel then offered Dr. Asher\u2019s quoted entry of April 30 (especially the second quoted part). This was received only as a prior inconsistent statement bearing on Dr. Asher\u2019s credibility, not as proof of the substance of the entry itself.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>Counsel contends that the judge erred in declining to allow full probative effect to Dr. Asher\u2019s entry.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We think the judge was right. The entry was a statement of opinion (at the very heart of the quarrel upon which expert testimony was called on both sides). Contrast <em>Diaz </em>v. <em>Eli Lilly &amp; Co., </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. 448, 452-453 (1982) (routine reporting of facts or diagnoses routinely made in hospital). Being an extrajudicial statement, the entry was hearsay and not admissible as proof of its content except by way of an exception to the general exclusionary rule. Counsel points to the exception embodied in G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 78, regarding records made in the regular course of business. Recent decisions demonstrate that the statute does not extend to the opinions of the preparer of the record (and in the present case, we may add, a preparer who himself conceded that he was not competent to give an opinion on such a matter). <em>Julian </em>v. <em>Randazzo, </em>380 Mass. 391, 393 (1980). See <em>Wingate </em>v. <em>Emery Air Freight Corp., </em>385 Mass. 402, 409 (1982) (concurring opinion); <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>O\u2019Neil, </em>1 Mass. App. Ct. 313, 317 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">Finally, counsel suggests, in effect, that it is time to get rid of the traditional confinement of prior inconsistent statements to a role merely as impeaching credibility. This would involve a far-reaching projection of <em>Commonwealth v. Daye, </em>393 Mass. 55, 65-75 (1984),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and in a situation quite unattractive for such an innovation, whatever might be thought of the merits of the suggested change as a general proposition. We have to note, further, that, given Dr. Asher\u2019s disclaimers both of observing anything amiss during the surgery and of having any expert competence, we doubt that admitting his entry as probative would have made any difference in the jury verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">2. Counsel offered to show through testimony by the plaintiff himself that, as indicated in Dr. Asher\u2019s entry of April 30, Dr. Asher had told him of the supposed cause of his injury. Intended somehow to enhance the entry and allow its admission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>as proof (rather than merely as a prior inconsistent statement by Dr. Asher), the offer could not be justified, and was properly rejected by the judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">3. A disability claims examiner at the Massachusetts Rehabilitation Commission on November 9, 1979, had a conversation by telephone with Dr. Asher about the plaintiff\u2019s condition and made a record of Dr. Asher\u2019s statement.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The judge properly refused the offer of this entry, of which the critical part was: \u201cUlnar nerve palsy. Secondary to anesthesia for prostate operation 9/22/78.\u201d This was no more admissible as proof than the proposed testimony of the plaintiff discussed immediately above. The attempt to invoke G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 78, also fails if for no other reason than that the record embodied (incompetent) opinion. And see also, as to \u201csecond level\u201d hearsay, <em>Julian </em>v. <em>Randazzo, </em>380 Mass. at 394; <em>Wingate </em>v. <em>Emery Air Freight Corp., </em>385 Mass. at 406-407; 409-410 (concurring opinion); <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>O\u2019Neil, </em>1 Mass. App. Ct. at 316-317 (1973). Cf. <em>Irwin </em>v. <em>Ware, 392 </em>Mass. 745, 748-751 (1984); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hussey, </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. 1015, 1016 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">4. Criticism of the judge for not giving certain instructions in the form tendered by the plaintiff is unimpressive. The instructions given were adequate and the action as a whole was conducted with care.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b420-7\"> The plaintiff\u2019s right arm was at his side; his left arm was extended on a padded board, palm up, at an angle of about ninety degrees from his body and was not taped down. The table was slightly tilted during the operation with a chance that the arm would shift upward to make a somewhat obtuse angle to the line of the lower body.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b420-8\"> On counts for injuries due to malpractice and for reimbursement of medical expenses.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b421-6\"> There was testimony that the plaintiff while at the hospital complained to a nurse about pains in both hands.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b421-7\"> \u201cPatient is informed\u201d might well be read as \u2014\u2022 Patient has already been informed by another.
