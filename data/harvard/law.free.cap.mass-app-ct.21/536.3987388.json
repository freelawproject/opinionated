G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 <em>32E(b) </em>(3), as appearing in St. 1982, c. 650, \u00a7 11. After a joint trial before a jury in the Superior Court, the defendants were convicted of trafficking at that level and of distributing cocaine in violation of G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32A, as appearing in St. 1982, c. 650, \u00a7 7. Silva was sentenced to a term of ten to fifteen years\u2019 imprisonment at M.C.I., Cedar Junction, on the trafficking charge and to a concurrent five to ten year term on the distributing charge. Saparosi was sentenced to a ten to twelve year term of imprisonment on the trafficking charge. His conviction of distributing was placed on file with his consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-9\">On appeal, both defendants argue that their motions to dismiss the charges were erroneously denied. The motions sought dismissal on contentions, first, that G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32E(\u00a3&gt;), which prohibits trafficking in cocaine, is unconstitutionally vague, and, second, that the sentencing provisions of c. 94C, \u00a7\u00a7 32E(\u00bf&gt;) (3) and 32H, prescribe \u201ccruel or unusual punishment\u201d in violation of art. 26 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights. In addition, Saparosi argues that the motion judge erred in denying his motion to suppress his post-arrest statements to the police and that the trial judge erred in refusing to give his requested instruction on the concept of \u201cindirect entrapment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b557-10\">The indictments stem from two transactions which occurred on January 13 and 14, 1983, at Silva\u2019s place of business, a lounge in Lawrence. The State police had received information that a large amount of cocaine was available for sale at the lounge and subsequently mounted an undercover operation that led to the defendants\u2019 arrest. At trial, the defendants did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>not dispute whether they had possessed or sold cocaine but claimed instead that they had been entrapped by the actions of an undercover State police trooper, Gregory C. Dem, and a police informant, Barry McCarthy.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">There was evidence in the defendants\u2019 case that on January 11, 1983, a Greg Freitas and the informant, McCarthy, were in Silva\u2019s lounge before 4:00 p.m. and again after 9:30 or 10:00 p.m. When they returned to the lounge, McCarthy beckoned Silva over and said, \u201cI\u2019m looking for one or two grams of cocaine. Do you know anyone that can help?\u201d Silva responded, \u201cNo.\u201d Within the next hour, according to Freitas, McCarthy, still in the bar area, asked Silva twice more for assistance in obtaining cocaine. Silva appeared to be agitated at the request. Finally, McCarthy and Freitas followed Silva into his office, where McCarthy renewed the request. There, Silva responded that he might know someone who could help. He called in Saparosi and said, \u201cBob, do me a favor. Get these guys off my back. See if you can help them.\u201d Saparosi allegedly stated, \u201cAre you serious? I know how you feel,\u201d to which Silva replied, \u201cYeah, just help them . . . .\u201d McCarthy and Saparosi talked, and Saparosi left to make a telephone call. When Saparosi returned, he said to McCarthy, \u201cI can\u2019t help you out,\u201d but indicated that McCarthy could obtain the two grams he sought the following day. On the next day (January 12) McCarthy told Silva that he would pick up the cocaine the day after (January 13) with a friend.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">On January 13, 1983, McCarthy, accompanied by Trooper Dem, went to Silva\u2019s bar. Dem asked Silva to sell him some cocaine, and after initial protests Silva again turned to Saparosi, asking, \u201cBobby, do you think you can get an ounce for them?\u201d Saparosi stated, \u201cI don\u2019t know . . . I\u2019ll have to ask the guy.\u201d Saparosi then spoke to one Carlos Arturo, who was sitting in the bar. Arturo left the lounge, and Saparosi returned to McCarthy and Dem and indicated that Arturo could get an ounce of cocaine for $2,300.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> While Arturo was gone, Dem asked Silva <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>about buying a pound of cocaine. Silva again stated that he was not in the business of selling cocaine. However, Silva later requested that Saparosi ask Arturo whether he could also obtain a pound; the answer was affirmative. When Arturo returned, he gave a white object to Saparosi. Saparosi gave an ounce of cocaine to Silva, who sold it to Dem for $2,300. Silva gave the money to Saparosi, who, in turn, gave it to Arturo. Silva also told Dem the price of the pound of cocaine and gave him the lounge office phone number so that Dem could verify his intention to proceed with the larger purchase.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">On the afternoon of January 14, Trooper Dem and undercover State Trooper William Gorman went to Silva\u2019s office at the lounge to buy the pound of cocaine. Dem gave Silva $32,000 in exchange for two bags which contained slightly less than one pound of cocaine.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Silva testified at trial that he had obtained the cocaine from Saparosi, who had previously obtained it from Arturo. As soon as the exchange took place, Trooper Gorman arrested Silva. Trooper Dem then went into the bar and arrested Saparosi.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">1. <em>Constitutionality of the statute </em>\u2014 <em>the claim of vagueness. </em>The defendants argue that their motions to dismiss the indictments should have been allowed because the statute under which they were convicted of trafficking in cocaine is void for vagueness.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">General Laws c. 94C, \u00a7 32E(\u00bf&gt;), as appearing in St. 1982, c. 650, \u00a7 11, provides as follows:<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201cAny person who trafficks in cocaine or any salt thereof by knowingly or intentionally [1] manufacturing, distributing, or dispensing or [2] possessing with intent to manufacture, distribute, or dispense or [3] by bringing into the commonwealth a net weight of twenty-eight grams or more of cocaine or any salt thereof or a net weight of twenty-eight grams or more of any mixture containing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>cocaine or any salt thereof\u201d shall be punished, by an increasing scale of mandatory minimum prison sentences, depending on the total net weight of the cocaine involved.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The defendants focus on the Legislature\u2019s use of commas in [1] and the \u201cor\u201d before the word \u201cdispensing.\u201d They contend that the commas should be read as having the conjunctive force of the word \u201cand\u201d, while the \u201cor\u201d should be given its usual disjunctive sense. The defendants concede that the statute may mean that engaging in any one of the various types of conduct specified in \u00a7 <em>32(b) </em>will constitute trafficking. Undaunted by that conclusion, however, they press their construction to argue that the statute is ambiguous because it may also be read as intending to punish only those defendants whose conduct involves the manufacture of cocaine <em>and </em>one other of the specified acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">Applying recognized standards of construction,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> we find no ambiguity in subsection <em>(b) </em>of G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32E, much less support for the crabbed interpretation of the statute\u2019s language that the defendants propose. In [1], [2], and [3], subsection</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number><em>(b) </em>sets forth three categories of activity that will constitute trafficking in cocaine. The first category lists three types of conduct that, for the purposes of this discussion, we shall term active behavior, namely, manufacturing, distributing, and dispensing. Within subsection <em>(b), </em>these types of behavior are listed (and conventionally punctuated with commas) as items in a series. The serial commas are not, as the defendants contend, a substitute for the word \u201cand\u201d inserted between coordinate adjectives. The words in the enumeration in [1] are gerunds (verbal nouns), not adjectives, and the \u201cobvious sense,\u201d see <em>Gaynor\u2019s Case, </em>217 Mass. 86, 89 (1914), dictates reading each of the commas as standing in place of an \u201cor.\u201d So too, the context of [1] and its manifest purposes indicate that the \u201cor\u201d is to be given its ordinary disjunctive meaning. See <em>id. </em>at 90; <em>Bello </em>v. <em>South Shore Hosp., </em>384 Mass. 770, 782 (1981), quoting from <em>Eastern Mass. St. Ry. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Authy., </em>350 Mass. 340, 343 (1966). Thus, a showing of any one of the three activities set forth in [1] will support a conviction for trafficking in cocaine. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Olivo, </em>369 Mass. 62, 66-67 (1975).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We conclude that the statute, on its face, sets out with sufficient clarity \u201cascertainable standards of guilt,\u201d and as a result, is not void for vagueness. <em>Winters </em>v. <em>New York, </em>333 U.S. 507, 515 (1948). See <em>Opinions of the Justices, </em>378 Mass. 822, 827 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">2. <em>Constitutionality of the statute </em>\u2014 <em>the claim of \u201ccruel or unusual\" punishment. </em>The defendants also argue that their motions to dismiss the indictments should have been allowed because the mandatory minimum ten-year prison sentence, see <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>note 5, <em>supra, </em>for someone who trafficks in 200 grams or more of cocaine (a Class B controlled substance), constitutes \u201ccruel or unusual\u201d punishment in violation of art. 26 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Their argument has two prongs: the first, that the penalty on its face impermissibly conflicts with art. 26, and, the second, that the punishment is constitutionally infirm when applied to offenders who, like the defendants, have no previous record of drug violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">We consider the first challenge (alleging facial invalidity of the punishment under art. 26) foreclosed by the reasoning in <em>Opinions of the Justices, </em>378 Mass. at 829-833. In those Opinions, the Justices of the Supreme Judicial Court considered the penalty provision of an earlier proposed version of G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32 (1979 Senate Doc. No. 777 of 1979) which would have imposed a mandatory minimum twenty-five year prison sentence on persons convicted of trafficking in any Class A through D controlled substance having a street value in excess of $25,000. A majority of the Justices concluded, after application of the relevant three-part analysis for determining whether punishment violates the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution or art. 26 of the Declaration of Rights,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> that the proposed twenty-five year sentence for drug trafficking would not conflict with either constitutional provision. In our view, it necessarily follows from the majority\u2019s opinion that the ten-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>year mandatory minimum sentence prescribed by G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7\u00a7 32E(b) (3) and 32H, for someone convicted of trafficking in 200 or more grams of cocaine (in these cases the sale involved slightly less than a pound for $32,000) is not prohibited by art. 26.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Marcus, </em>16 Mass. App. Ct. 698 (1983) (finding a mandatory five-year prison sentence for distributing a class A controlled substance when imposed on a repeat offender selling no more heroin than was necessary to support his habit not violative of the prohibitions against cruel or unusual punishment).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">We also reject the contention that the punishment violates art. 26 when applied to offenders like the defendants, who have no previous record involving drug offenses.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> A statute designed to protect the public from illegal drugs recognizes that drug addiction \u201cdegrades and impoverishes those whom it enslaves\u201d and that addiction is a significant cause of family disruption and crime. <em>People </em>v. <em>Broadie, </em>37 N.Y. 2d 100, 113, cert. denied, 423 U.S. 950 (1975). The most culpable in the \u201cpernicious cycle\u201d of illegal drug use are narcotics traffickers selling for profit, for they provide a critical link in spawning more addicts and sellers. <em>Carmona </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>576 F.2d 405, 412 (2d Cir. 1978), cert. denied, 439 U.S. 1091 (1979). We have stated that the \u201cLegislature may . . . reasonably impose severe punishment upon those convicted of [drug] traffic in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>the hope of discouraging not only the primary crime . . . but ... the secondary personal and property crimes\u201d as well. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Marcus, supra </em>at 699.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">The Legislature could rely on these considerations and could note as well the evils of cocaine<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> in establishing a ten-year mandatory minimum prison sentence for persons in the defendants\u2019 circumstances who are convicted of trafficking. Dealing in 200 grams or more of cocaine usually signals the presence of a large-scale dealer who has access to the drug in quantity and who is intent on profit without regard for the law or its consequences. Moreover, because \u201cnarcotics sales are not simply isolated economic transactions,\u201d <em>Opinions of the Justices, </em>378 Mass. at 831, the sale by the defendants of close to a pound of cocaine would likely lead to untold misery on the streets and more crime.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">While we recognize that the efficacy of mandatory minimum sentencing can be reasonably debated, there is substantial support for the theory that definite punishment will help to reduce crime. See <em>Opinions of the Justices, supra </em>at 832. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>369 Mass. 904, 912-913 (1976). In imposing a nondiscretionary minimum ten-year prison sentence on any offender under the statute, the Legislature may have sought, by the certainty of the punishment, to remove <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>traffickers from society and to deter others from similar criminal activity. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Marcus, supra </em>at 701. The Legislature may also have reasoned that achieving these goals could, in turn, help curb the rising incidence of cocaine use and that the goals are reasonably related to recognized purposes of punishment. See <em>Cepulonis </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>384 Mass. 495, 499 (1981), appeal dismissed, 455 U.S. 931 (1982). In the absence of any constitutional requirement that a mandatory minimum sentence be imposed only on a repeat offender, and in view of the fact that the criminal activity engaged in by the defendants was indicative of large-scale drug dealing, the defendants\u2019 sentencing in accordance with the requirements of G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7\u00a7 <em>32E(b) </em>(3) and 32H, did not amount to \u201ccruel or unusual\u201d punishment under art. 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">3. <em>Motion to suppress. </em>After his arrest, Saparosi was driven to the State police barracks in Andover by Troopers Dem and Gorman. During the ride, and after having been read the Miranda warnings, Saparosi allegedly stated, \u201cI was only doing this to make a few extra dollars. I have a wife and children and I needed the money. I had just met Carlos Arturo several days earlier. He came up from New York and he said he had eight kilos of cocaine.\u201d Saparosi\u2019s motion to suppress these statements was denied prior to trial. At the hearing on the motion to suppress, Saparosi testified on direct examination by his trial counsel that he had never had any experience with the police before, that the police questioned him both before and after reading the Miranda warnings, and that Trooper Dem had made certain statements Saparosi understood to mean that he would receive favorable treatment if he gave the police information.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">The motion judge made no findings of fact in connection with his denial of the motion, as he should have. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mattias, </em>8 Mass. App. Ct. 786, 788 (1979). However, we do not think that a remand for findings is necessary, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>as the grounds on which the motion was heard \u201care sufficiently well defined so that we are able to infer from the record what the trial judge must have found and can test the correctness of his actionf] on the motion[].\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gaulden, </em>383 Mass. 543, 547 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">There was evidence that Saparosi was born in Argentina, studied engineering in college there for two years, and had been in the United States for seven years at the time of his arrest. Twenty-nine years old, he was married, had a child, and had been employed in the Lawrence area. Saparosi understood English and was fluent in the Spanish and Italian languages as well. He was given all the Miranda warnings, which he admitted he understood. There was no evidence that, at the time of his arrest, he was incapacitated by either alcohol or drugs. He did not have any mental or physical illness. He further indicated that neither Trooper Dem nor Trooper Gorman had threatened him at any time, and that Trooper Dem was not \u201caggressive\u201d toward him after he had been given his Miranda warnings. Saparosi further admitted, in cross-examination, that Trooper Dem had promised him \u201cnothing at all.\u201d The challenged statement was made after Saparosi received and understood his Miranda warnings. According to Trooper Dem, he had asked Saparosi no questions after giving him the Miranda warnings and prior to the point at which the statement was volunteered by Saparosi.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">On the evidence described, we think the motion judge could permissibly have concluded either (a) that Saparosi had volunteered the statement after having received and understood the Miranda warnings, perhaps to curry favor with the police, or (b) that the statement had been made (again after receipt and understanding of Miranda warnings) in response to a general suggestion by Trooper Dem that Saparosi\u2019s cooperation would be brought to the attention of Dem\u2019s superior, a suggestion that Saparosi admitted he did not understand as a promise. On either analysis, the denial of the motion to suppress was proper.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>4. <em>Entrapment instructions. </em>Saparosi made a request of the trial judge that the jury be instructed in accordance with the instruction set forth in the margin,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and his counsel made a timely and specific objection to the judge\u2019s failure to give the requested instruction. He argues that the lack of the instruction, or something like it, constitutes reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">The instruction was designed to raise in Saparosi\u2019s behalf the issue of indirect or vicarious entrapment. That concept has been defined as follows: \u201cIf a person is brought into a criminal scheme after being informed indirectly of conduct or statements by a government agent which could amount to inducement, then that person should be able to avail himself of the defense of entrapment just as may the person who receives the inducement directly.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Valencia, </em>645 F.2d 1158, 1168 (2d Cir. 1980), reh\u2019g en banc denied, 669 F.2d 37 (2d Cir. 1981), aff\u2019d after remand, 677 F.2d 191 (2d Cir. 1982). Although there is room for dispute as to the circumstances in which the government can be held responsible for entrapment by a third person,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> there is no question that \u201c[ejntrapment . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>may occur as the result of conduct by [third parties who in effect are acting as government] agents or as a result of governmental action through private citizens. See, e.g., <em>Lopez </em>v. <em>United States, </em>373 U.S. 427 (1963); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>411 U.S. 423 (1973); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Myers, </em>692 F.2d 823 (2d Cir. 1982), cert. denied, 461 U.S. 961 (1983); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Silvestri, </em>719 F.2d 577 (2d Cir. 1983); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>366 F.2d 167 (6th Cir. 1966); <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>317 F.2d 127 (D.C. Cir. 1963).\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>McLernon, </em>746 F.2d 1098, 1109 (6th Cir. 1984). As a general proposition, in a case involving contact between a middleman and a defendant, the issue of entrapment will not arise in the absence of some evidence showing that the government\u2019s inducement of the middleman has been communicated to the defendant or evidence showing that the middleman was consciously recruited by the government to induce the defendant to join in the commission of the crime. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Toner, </em>728 F.2d 115, 126-127 (2d Cir. 1984). As was said in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Myers, supra </em>at 840 n.13: \u201cGovernment responsibility [on the basis of entrapment] has been rejected where the circumstances showed [that ] . . . [a government] agent induces a middleman to commit a crime, and the middleman, responding to the pressure upon him, <em>takes it upon himself </em>to induce another person to participate in the crime\u201d (emphasis supplied). See also Note, Entrapment Through Unsuspecting Middlemen, 95 Harv. L. Rev. 1122, 1129 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">We think that Saparosi\u2019s evidence was insufficient to raise an issue as to his entrapment (on the basis of Silva\u2019s alleged entrapment) because the evidence did not show a sufficient nexus between the government\u2019s activity with Silva and Saparosi\u2019s conduct. There was no evidence to show that the inducement relied upon by Silva to claim entrapment had been communicated to Saparosi.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Nor was there any evidence which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>would warrant a finding by the jury that the government had engaged Silva in order to draw Saparosi into a criminal scheme. Because the State police had information that Silva was selling cocaine, the \u201csting\u201d operation to purchase drugs did not of necessity have to involve Saparosi (or, for that matter, any other defendant). Moreover, Saparosi\u2019s basic position at trial was that he was a somewhat unsuspecting dupe who acted out of friendship and loyalty to Silva. Thus, the situation depicted by the evidence indicated that the criminal opportunity created for Saparosi, vis \u00e1 vis Silva, stemmed not from activity by government agents but from Silva\u2019s independent management of the details of the enterprise.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">In this context, the trial judge gave Saparosi the benefit of a comprehensive and clear charge on the possible role of the government in the crimes. The jury were told that they should acquit Saparosi if they should find that \u201cthe actions of the law enforcement officers or their agents were so fundamentally unfair as to be offensive to . . . basic standards of decency, justice and fairness . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The jury were also told to consider whether Saparosi had been entrapped.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> In that regard, there were ample and correct instructions on the elements of entrapment, including an instruction that \u201cpersons who are not law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>enforcement officials, [but who] act with official encouragement or insistence [are to be] consider[ed] [government agents for the purpose of . . . entrapment.\u201d The jury were also told, at several points in the final charge, that they could acquit Saparosi on the basis of entrapment without finding that Silva had been entrapped. This instruction, taken with the broad definition given to the term \u201cgovernment agent,\u201d may have directed the jury to the possibility that Saparosi\u2019s contact with Silva, as opposed to his contact with McCarthy, could justify a finding of entrapment. In that respect, the charge may have been more favorable to Saparosi than was warranted. Based on the evidence, we conclude that Saparosi received the benefit of all that he was entitled to. The rejection of his proposed instruction on entrapment was not error.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b558-7\"> Arturo and another defendant, one Luz Rodriguez, were arrested with Saparosi and Silva but were tried separately.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b559-8\"> The total was 396.5 grams of cocaine.

In each case, the maximum sentence of imprisonment is set at fifteen years. Fines (in amounts designated) may also be imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">The minimum punishment established by \u00a7 <em>32E(b) </em>(3) is mandatory in the sense that G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32H, provides that a sentence under \u00a7 32E shall not be suspended or reduced until the mandatory minimum term has been served, nor until that time shall the prisoner be eligible for parole.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b560-8\"> In examining the controverted language, we are mindful that due process requires that criminal statutes be sufficiently clear to give notice of the prohibited conduct, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bohmer, </em>374 Mass. 368, 371 (1978), and that ordinary rules of statutory construction require that we construe any criminal statute strictly against the government. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gagnon, </em>387 Mass. 567, 569 (1982). These principles are guides to resolving ambiguity where it exists. They do not require that we find ambiguity where it does not exist or that we adopt any interpretation that most favors a defendant. \u201c[T]he vagueness doctrine is not a counsel of perfection.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gallant, </em>373 Mass. 577, 580 (1977). Where the language in a criminal statute conveys a definite warning of the proscribed conduct, when measured by common understanding and practice, it is constitutionally adequate. <em>Opinions of the Justices, </em>378 Mass. 822, 827 (1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b561-6\"> Moreover, in G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32E(6), the Legislature specified other forms of conduct that will also constitute trafficking. One set of alternatives, set forth in [2], and also punctuated with serial commas, comprises possession of cocaine with the intent to manufacture, distribute or dispense it. The final activity identified by [3] as trafficking consists of bringing more than twenty-eight grams of cocaine, a cocaine salt, or a mixture of cocaine or a salt of cocaine into the Commonwealth. The use of the disjunctive \u201cor\u201d between each segment of the statute indicates again that a showing of any one of the activities will constitute trafficking.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b562-6\"> Article 26 provides that \u201c[n]o magistrate or court of law, shall . . . inflict cruel or unusual punishments.\u201d This provision may have a meaning different from the language used in the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution (\u201cnor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted\u201d).

Jackson, supra </em>at 910-916.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b563-6\"> We note that some other jurisdictions impose comparably severe mandatory minimum prison sentences for large sales of illegal controlled substances.

Code Ann. \u00a7 16-13-31 [a] [2] [Supp. 1985]); New York, fifteen years for the sale of two or more ounces of controlled substances, including cocaine (New York Penal Law \u00a7\u00a7 220:43 , 60:05-2, 70.00-3 [a] [i] [McKinney Supp. 1986]); South Carolina, twenty-five years and $100,000 fine for the sale of 200 to 400 grams (S.C. Code Ann. \u00a7 44-53-370 [e] [2] [d] [Law. Co-op. 1976]); Tennessee, ten years, with maximum of life imprisonment and discretionary $200,000 fine, for the sale of thirty grams or more (Tenn.

See Uelmen &amp; Haddox, Drug Abuse and the Law Sourcebook \u00a7 2.6 (a) (1985). According to estimates by the National Institute on Drug Abuse, every day about 5,000 Americans try cocaine for the first time. Other estimates indicate that about 22,000,000 people have experimented with the drug so far. Addiction is easily achieved and hard to cure. \u201cThe number of people with cocaine related problems seeking admission to federally funded drug clinics climbed by 600 percent from 1976 to 1981 \u2014 the most recent period for which a figure is available.

We note that in <em>United States </em>v. <em>McLernon, supra at </em>1108, the middleman, a Mexican Indian, had a \u201cblood brother\u201d relationship with the government agent.

The defendant in the case before us makes a considerably less compelling argument for our applying the defense to his case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b569-7\"> Alternatively, the evidence could be found to show that the trilingual Saparosi was a willing and useful conduit in a scheme to assist Carlos Arturo, a Hispanic who purportedly spoke no English, in marketing eight or more kilos of cocaine in cooperation with Silva.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b569-8\"> This instruction, in essence, advised the jury that they should acquit Saparosi if they concluded that the government\u2019s conduct was so shocking or offensive that it deprived him of his constitutional right to due process of law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b569-9\"> This instruction was apparently based on the evidence pertaining to Saparosi\u2019s contact with McCarthy, who was a government agent.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
