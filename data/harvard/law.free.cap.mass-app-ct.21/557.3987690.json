The employee urges that the single member and the board erroneously ruled that the prima facie effect of G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 7A, did not apply and that they also improperly considered opinion evidence of two physicians which was based in part on facts not admitted in evidence. We agree that there was error in the decision of the board and reverse the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">The findings and decision of the single member which were adopted by the board explain that the employee had been employed by the town of Foxborough as a general laborer and that his duties included snowplowing and road building. \u201cThe Employee was performing his regular work-related duties on March 22, 1973, when he was found by fellow employees slumped on the ground. He had been removing gravel from a truck, which he would put into a wheelbarrow and deposit the gravel into a trench.\u201d The employee was taken to a hospital, where the examining physician found slurred speech and paralysis. Although the employee\u2019s speech became normal an hour after arrival at the hospital, his condition worsened during the first twenty-four hours of hospitalization and he became totally disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">The primary factual issue was whether the employee\u2019s injury was causally related to his employment. \u201cAdopting\u201d the medical opinions of the two physicians deposed by the insurer,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the single member found that \u201cthe Employee has failed to prove by a fair preponderance of the evidence presented that an injury was sustained on March 22, 1973, arising out of and in the course of his employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">1. <em>Applicability of G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 7A. </em>The employee, who in 1980 was under permanent guardianship as a mentally ill person, was physically and mentally unable to testify at the hearings. He sought by means of two separate motions to estab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>lish a prima facie case for compensation by reason of G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 7A. That statute is set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> If applicable, \u00a7 7A provides in substance that in the case of an employee unable to testify, \u201cit shall be prima facie evidence that the employee was performing his regular duties on the day of injury\u201d and that the claim is compensable. Unless that prima facie evidence is met and overcome by evidence sufficient to warrant a contrary conclusion, the employee is entitled to benefits. A finding for the employee is warranted \u201cwithout actual medical evidence of causal relationship.\u201d <em>Anderson\u2019s Case, </em>373 Mass. 813, 818 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">The single member denied both motions to have \u00a7 7A apply. His explanation for denying the employee\u2019s first motion was that the current inability of the employee to testify was not a ground for the application of the statute as \u201can attorney could or would merely wait until an Employee died, then file a Claim under Section 7A.\u201d In the single member\u2019s view what is required is \u201cthat one must establish <em>immediacy, </em>i.e., an immediate connection between the workplace and the death, injury or disability of the Employee.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">Here, however, there is no dispute that an incident occurred while the employee was working at his place of employment or that he became disabled and unable to testify during the first twenty-four hours of hospitalization following that event. The employee has never regained his mental abilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">In these circumstances, we conclude that the time elements required by the statute have been met.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> There is no suggestion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>in the record that the delay in hearing, reached by agreement, was to obtain the advantage of the statute. For \u00a7 7A to be applicable, no additional connection between the workplace and the injury need be shown. Once in effect, the statute establishes \u201cprima facie evidence of causal relationship between the employment and the injury.\u201d <em>Anderson\u2019s Case, </em>373 Mass. at 816-817.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">The single member in denying the employee\u2019s second motion for the application of \u00a7 7A expressed concern lest the insurer be denied a \u201cright of constitutional dimension.\u201d That concern seems misplaced, as the insurer is entitled to overcome the prima facie evidence of \u00a7 7A by introducing other evidence. Moreover, the statute does not affect the admissibility of any admissions of the employee made at a time prior to his disability or made during a lucid interval at the hospital. We hold, therefore, that the single member and the board erred in ruling G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 7A, inapplicable. See generally Locke, Workmen\u2019s Compensation \u00a7 221 (2d ed. 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">2. <em>Opinions of physicians. </em>We turn next to the medical evidence of the insurer. Prior to the hearing before the board, the employee sought to strike the opinion evidence of the two physicians (Dr. Sagall and Dr. Winkler) who were witnesses for the insurer on the issue of causal relationship. The motion to strike was based on the claim that the opinions were predicated on facts not in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">The testimony of Dr. Egan, the claimant\u2019s physician, indicates that an important issue in determining whether the injury was causally related to the employee\u2019s employment, or was j\u00fcst a coincidence, was the extent to which physical effort was exerted by the employee prior to the incident. The only document admitted in evidence bearing on this issue was the employer\u2019s first report of injury, dated April 11, 1973.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> That report <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>stated that \u201cthere was tremendous physical exertion used when trying to close [scuttle door]<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> resulting in his collapse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">The direct evidence<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> as to what the employee had been doing came from a fellow employee. He testified that on the day of the incident the employee\u2019s work consisted of taking stones from a truck to a trench, that this involved putting a wheelbarrow under a hole in the truck and using a \u201cscuttle mechanism that opens and closes the hole.\u201d He testified that moving the scuttle involves \u201csubstantial effort,\u201d and that Collins had been working for two and one-half to three hours prior to the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">Despite the lack of any substantive evidence supporting their recitals, both Dr. Sagall and Dr. Winkler in their opinions specifically referred to a hearsay statement contained in a hospital record, never put in evidence, explaining what the employee was doing at the time of the incident. Dr. Sagall\u2019s July 6, 1973, letter included the following: \u201cThe records of the Sturdy Memorial Hospital for the admission of March 22nd to April 17, 1973, stated that this man, employed as a laborer for the Town of Foxboro, was seated and doing some work at the rear of a truck on the morning of admission when he suddenly noted that he did not have the strength to get to his feet. His speech was garbled .... Based on the pathology which has been diagnosed, namely, a cerebral artery thrombosis, <em>and the sequence of events elaborated, </em>it is my opinion that this condition resulted solely\u201d from natural progression of arteriosclerotic disease \u201cand was not causally connected to or proximately precipitated by his work activities.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>Dr. Winkler, who, unlike Dr. Sagall, had not examined the employee, also based his opinion<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> on hospital and other records not in evidence as well as on two medical reports of Dr. Sagall which contain material the claimant seeks to strike. Dr. Winkler\u2019s clinical summary gave the following explanation of the March 22, 1973, incident. \u201cThe history obtained by [the admitting physician] stated that the patient had been seated and doing some work at the rear of a truck when he suddenly noted that he did not have the strength to get to his feet. When people came to assist him, his speech was garbled and he wasn\u2019t able to make himself understood. For that reason he was taken to the hospital.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">The report of Dr. Egan, the employee\u2019s physician, was based on different facts. In his report, he described the employee as having been engaged \u201cin heavy work\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and in his deposition stated that the employee was engaged in \u201cextremely heavy work.\u201d On cross-examination he indicated that \u201cheavy repetitive work would be a factor [in precipitating the incident], and light duty would probably have nothing to do with it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">It is apparent that the recitation in the hospital record that \u201cthe employee had been seated and doing some work . . . when he suddenly noted that he did not have the strength to get to his feet\u201d may have influenced the two medical opinions.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>See Fiander\u2019s Case, </em>293 Mass. 157, 163 (1936). Even though such history may have been \u201copen to the inspection of the division\u201d (G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 20, as amended through St. 1953, c. 314, \u00a7 6), where what the employee was doing at the time was an issue of fact before the board, the history may not be regarded by reason of that statute alone to be in evidence and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>thereby corroborate the findings of the insurer\u2019s physicians. <em>Id. </em>at 164.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">Where specific facts are in controversy, \u201c[e]xpert opinion . . . must be based on either the expert\u2019s direct personal knowledge, on evidence already in the record or which the parties represent will be presented during the course of the trial, or on a combination of these sources.\u201d <em>LaClair </em>v. <em>Silberline Mfg. Co., </em>379 Mass. 21, 32 (1979). <em>Charron\u2019s Case, </em>331 Mass. 519, 522-523 (1954). <em>Cormier\u2019s Case, </em>337 Mass. 714, 716 (1958). <em>Buck\u2019s Case, </em>342 Mass. 766, 771 (1961). <em>Soares </em>v. <em>Stop &amp; Shop Cos., </em>16 Mass. App. Ct. 979, 979-980 (1983). See <em>Haley\u2019s Case, </em>356 Mass. 678, 680-682 (1970). In <em>Soares </em>v. <em>Stop &amp; Shop Cos., </em>16 Mass. App. Ct. at 980, the decision relied on by the insurer, <em>Trani\u2019s Case, 4 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 857 (1976), was said not to reflect current Massachusetts law. See Liacos, Massachusetts Evidence 125 (5th ed. 1981). Compare Locke, Workmen\u2019s Compensation \u00a7\u00a7 518-519 (1981 andSupp. 1984), which may have gone to press before the <em>Soares </em>case was decided and thus may require revision.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">Because no evidence was introduced to prove the facts upon which the doctors relied, at least in part, \u201cit was then in order when the case was before the reviewing board [for the objecting party] to move to strike the opinion of the doctor in so far as it was based in any way upon facts not proved.\u201d <em>Charron\u2019s Case, </em>331 Mass. at 523.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">Although the parties agreed to \u201csubmit\u201d the doctors\u2019 reports to the single member, the insurer does not claim that the claimant was precluded from asking the board to strike them. The usual rule is that the decision of the reviewing board \u201csuperseded and made unimportant that of the single member.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 522. The board denied, without giving its reasons, the claimant\u2019s motion to strike the disputed medical reports. On the record as it stood, the claimant was entitled to have the decision of the single member reviewed \u201cas if those reports were not parts of the record or, in the alternative, to recommit the case to the single member for further proceedings.\u201d <em>Russo\u2019s Case, </em>1 Mass. App. Ct. 206, 207-208 (1973). In sum, the board should have allowed the employee\u2019s motion to strike the opin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>ions of the insurer\u2019s experts. See <em>Charron\u2019s Case, </em>331 Mass. at 523; <em>Russo\u2019s Case, </em>1 Mass. App. Ct. at 207-208.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">3. <em>Remedy. </em>The incident at bar occurred in 1973, almost thirteen years ago, and it is unlikely that the material in the hospital report can now be substantiated. Moreover, the findings of the single member (adopted by the board) as to what the employee was doing at the time of the incident (i.e., \u201cperforming his regular work-related duties\u201d as a general laborer \u201cremoving gravel from a truck, which he would put into a wheelbarrow and deposit the gravel into a trench\u201d) seem somewhat inconsistent with the hospital report. The findings would have been sufficient, in light of G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 7A, to make out a prima facie case for recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">On the record as it stood, the opinions of the insurer\u2019s physicians should have been struck. The decision of the single member (adopted by the board) is also tainted by the error of law as to \u00a7 7A, an error which may have misled the insurer in presenting its case before the single member. In these circumstances we think the case should be recommitted to the Industrial Accident Board, see <em>Assessors of Boston </em>v. <em>Diab, </em>396 Mass. 560, 563 (1986), to determine whether (a) to strike the medical records and make an appropriate award to the claimant without further medical evidence or (b) to hear additional evidence (by the board or the single member) on such issues as the board in its discretion determines including the issue whether the medical opinions would be altered if the history contained in the hospital report were deleted and the facts considered to be those found by the single member.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">The judgment is reversed, and the matter is to be remanded to the reviewing board for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b577-14\"> Other issues argued by the employee, relating to the admission or exclusion of evidence by the single member, were not before the Superior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>Court judge or this court, as the record does not show that such issues were preserved by raising them before the board. <em>Indrisano\u2019s Case, </em>307 Mass. 520, 521 (1940). <em>Haley\u2019s Case, </em>356 Mass. 678, 682 (1970).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b578-9\"> The deposition testimony and reports of the two physicians were admitted without objection before the single member.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b579-8\"> General Laws c. 152, \u00a7 7A, as appearing in St. 1971, c. 702, provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b579-9\">\u201cIn any claim for compensation where the employee has been killed, or found dead at his place of employment or is physically or mentally unable to testify, it shall be prima facie evidence that the employee was performing his regular duties on the day of injury or fatality or death or disability and that the claim comes within the provisions of this chapter, that sufficient notice of the injury has been given, and that the injury or death or disability was not occasioned by the wilful intention of the employee to injure or kill himself or another.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b579-10\"> We need not consider whether the provision would also apply to a subsequent testimonial disability of an employee.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b580-8\"> There appears to have been no objection to the admission of this document. <em>O\u2019Hara\u2019s Case, </em>310 Mass. 223, 227 (1941).
