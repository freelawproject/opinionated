See G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 31. The Commonwealth was granted (by a single justice of the Supreme Judicial Court) leave to file an interlocutory appeal, and did appeal, from the allowance by a Superior Court judge of Pacheco\u2019s motion to suppress certain items seized under a search warrant, which expressly authorized a search of the cellar of 8 Lyford Street, Dorchester. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>There the suppressed items were found by members of the Boston police department\u2019s drug control unit. The warrant had been issued pursuant to an affidavit of Officer Joseph Driscoll of the drug control unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">The motion judge (in a memorandum accompanying his allowance of the motion to suppress the items found in the search) treated the issue before him as \u201cwhether the statements ... in the affidavit supported the inference that the . . . property [sought] could reasonably have been expected to be located in the places specified\u201d in Officer Driscoll\u2019s affidavit. The judge correctly concluded \u201cthat the affidavit on its face established probable cause for the search of the first floor apartment.\u201d He ruled, however, that the affidavit contained nothing which warranted \u201cmore than a vague suspicion that controlled substances were being concealed in the common basement of this three-family house.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">For this conclusion, the judge relied on <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Erickson, </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. 501, 504-506 (1982). The present case is distinguishable from the <em>Erickson </em>case on its facts. In the present case, the affidavit directed attention to only one apartment (said in the affidavit to be occupied by one Paccino)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in a three-story apartment structure. The suspicious transactions, credibly reported by an informant previously proved reliable, took place principally in that ground floor apartment. The warrant directed only a search (as requested in the application for the warrant) \u201cin certain rooms, closets, storage areas, and cellar in the 1st floor three story wooden dwelling\u201d here under discussion. In the <em>Erickson </em>case, the building involved was a vertically divided multiple dwelling structure, in which firearms (the subject of that search) in the possession of some individuals and the individuals themselves had not been con-' nected by the affidavit with Erickson\u2019s second floor apartment or with Erickson himself. It was not shown that any individuals seen with firearms had access to that apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">The present motion judge\u2019s conclusion that there was probable cause for the search of the first floor apartment necessarily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>implied satisfaction of the \u201ctwo-pronged\u201d test of <em>Spinelli </em>v. <em>United States, </em>393 U.S. 410 (1969), and <em>Aguilar </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>378 U.S. 108 (1964). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Upton, </em>394 Mass. 363 (1985), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saleh, </em>396 Mass. 406, 407 (1985). Officer Driscoll\u2019s affidavit established sufficiently both the proved reliability and credibility of the informant and existence of probable cause to search the apartment. Photographs of the cellar area and of the building introduced in evidence at the hearing on the motion to suppress showed the nature of the structure itself and the presence in the cellar of utility meters and heaters to which all the tenants of each of the several apartments certainly would be entitled to have common access.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">We think the motion judge viewed the affidavit and the magistrate\u2019s decision to issue the warrant (based on the affidavit) in hypertechnical fashion, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Atchue, </em>393 Mass. 343, 345-349 (1982), inconsistent with Massachusetts decisions like <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cefalo, </em>381 Mass. 319, 324-330 (1980), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cinelli, </em>389 Mass. 197, 213-214 (1983). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burt, </em>393 Mass. 703, 715-716 (1985); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saleh, </em>396 Mass. at 412, and cases cited; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Germain, </em>396 Mass. 413, 418 (1985). Reading the affidavit with \u201ca common sense, non-technical approach,\u201d the magistrate reasonably could infer that any cellar area close to the first floor apartment (and to which its occupants had access) might be used by Pacheco or any other occupant of the apartment to store the cocaine observed by the informant.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">As probable cause existed to search Pacheco\u2019s apartment, we conclude that probable cause had been established to search any reasonably related cellar area of that apartment as a dwelling to the extent, at least, that any such search involved no sig<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>nificant invasion of any part of the cellar where tenants of other apartments had a reasonable expectation of privacy or of exclusive occupancy. The probable cause established by Officer Driscoll\u2019s affidavit related to Pacheco \u2019 s apartment without regard to a particular room. For example, the affidavit provided no special cause to search the bathroom or kitchen. Yet, surely, probable cause extended to a search of each of those rooms. The same is true of the cellar because, given the realities of modem city multiple dwellings, the occupants of each apartment typically have access, either common or exclusive, to at least parts of the cellar.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">The facts of the present case resemble in certain respects the situation discussed in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>358 Mass. 771, 772-775 (1971).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> There police officers, acting upon advice from an informant, went to premises where drag distribution was suspected. The defendant, Thomas, occupied one of two apartments on the third floor. The officers had no search warrant and made no attempt to obtain one. A rear cellar door was \u201copen an inch or so.\u201d The officers pushed it open and entered the cellar without permission from any person. In the ceiling of what was plainly a cellar used by all tenants of the building, they found in a somewhat exposed area, in a paper bag, cardboard boxes containing packages of heroin. They replaced these items in the ceiling and watched the cellar area. When Thomas entered the cellar a few hours later and went to the hiding place he was arrested. His motion to suppress the contraband items was denied. This action was sustained by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>the Supreme Judicial Court, which held (at 774-775) that entering the cellar, although a trespass, was at most a trespass against the building owner. \u201cIt did not invade an area within the \u2018curtilage\u2019 of Thomas\u2019s apartment .... In a modem urban multi-family apartment house, the area within the \u2018curtilage\u2019 is necessarily much more limited than in the case of a rural dwelling subject to one owner\u2019s control .... In such an apartment house, a tenant\u2019s dwelling [i.e., as a part of its curtilage] cannot reasonably be said to extend beyond his own apartment and perhaps any separate areas subject to his exclusive control.\u201d 358 Mass. at 774-75.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> To deny the authority of a magistrate expressly to allow by warrant a search of any area of a cellar to which the occupant of an apartment has either exclusive access or access shared with others, where probable cause to search the apartment has been established, would present a serious obstacle to proper law enforcement. It would immunize, in effect, from search an important area where an occupant of that apartment could conceal contraband or other objects of a proper search. This would greatly reduce the incentive to the police to follow the preferred route of seeking a warrant. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ventresca, </em>380 U.S. 102, 108-109 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">The order granting the motion to suppress is reversed and the matter is remanded to the Superior Court for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b586-8\"> No question appears to have been raised at trial and none was raised before us that Pacheco was not the Paccino referred to in the affidavit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b587-7\"> When the search was made, cocaine was found in a padlocked tool box concealed in the ceiling of the cellar. A key which fitted the padlock was taken from Pacheco, who admitted that he owned the tool box and the key that opened it. When first seen at the time of the search, Pacheco was installing a radio in his automobile in a parking lot adjacent to 8 Lyford Street and was not in the first floor apartment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b588-6\"> The <em>Thomas </em>case has been cited with apparent approval in later authorities. See e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Battle, </em>365 Mass. 472, 475 n.3 (1974); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dinnall, </em>366 Mass. 165, 167 (1974); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Albert, </em>391 Mass. 853, 862 (1984); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Frazer, </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 429, 432-433 (1980); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Pagan, </em>537 F.2d 554, 557-558 (1st Cir. 1976); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Arboleda, </em>633 F.2d 985, 992 (2d Cir. 1980), cert. denied 450 U.S. 917 (1981). Compare <em>Commonwealth v. Hall, </em>366 Mass. 790, 794-795 (1975) (separate area near apartment of building owner and under his control not within the <em>Thomas </em>case principle); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pietrass, </em>392 Mass. 892, 899 n.11 (1984, whether a porch within the \u201ccurtilage\u201d of premises a matter of fact to be determined). See for cases dealing generally with similar situations 1 &amp; 2 LaFave, Search and Seizure \u00a7\u00a7 2.3, 2.4, 4.5(b) (1978 &amp; Supps. 1985).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b589-7\"> The <em>Thomas </em>case suggests that the search of the cellar as a common area in the present case might not have required a warrant, because it was not shown to have been an area to which Pacheco had exclusive access and thus not within the \u201ccurtilage\u201d of his apartment. We approve, nevertheless, the prudent action of the police in seeking a warrant. The cellar was closely related to the occupancy of Pacheco\u2019s apartment and access to it was an incident of the occupancy even if it was not within its curtilage. Because of his access to the cellar it was a place in which he might store contraband if he was prepared (as he proved to be) to run the risk that others would find the drugs before he needed them.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
