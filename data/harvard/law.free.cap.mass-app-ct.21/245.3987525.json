The 1978 and subsequent events may be summarized as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>A collective bargaining agreement between the Leominster school committee (the Committee) and Leominster Education Association (LEA), the bargaining agent for the city\u2019s school teachers, expired on August 31, 1978. Negotiations for a new agreement had reached an impasse by the late summer of 1978. On a carry-over basis, however, the provisions of the old agreement continued in effect through February, 1979, including the sick-leave provision (art. XIV, see note 6, <em>infra, </em>and related text). Indeed, the next later agreement continued art. XIV in effect without material change.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">The secretary of the Committee, on November 16, 1978, wrote to the presidents of LEA and the Massachusetts Teachers Association (MTA) reciting that the Committee had learned from reliable sources that teachers and LEA were \u201ccontemplating a .. . \u2018sick-out\u2019 \u201d on November 22, 1978. The letters each called attention to G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 9A,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> prohibiting strikes by public employees and providing a method for application to the Massachusetts Labor Relations Commission (the Commission) for a prompt investigation. These letters requested assurances from LEA and MTA that they, respectively, were not contemplating activities prohibited by \u00a7 9A (a) and stated that the Committee (1) would ask the Commission for an investigation of any work stoppage, (2) would require a physician\u2019s statement from any employee absent from school, (3) would pay no compensation \u201cfor . . . [any] day missed, in appropriate cases,\u201d and (4) would take other appropriate disciplinary action. In November, 1978, however, no work stoppage took place.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>On February 15 and 16, 1979, ninety-five of the 400 classroom teachers employed by the Committee called in sick on at least one of these two days in circumstances more fully set out in note 7, <em>infra. </em>When faced with this situation on February 15, 1979, Leominster\u2019s superintendent of schools (the Superintendent) then distributed to each teacher on that day a memorandum which in part is reproduced in the margin.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Committee on February 15, 1979, also filed with the Commission a request for an investigation under \u00a7 9A (b), see note 2, <em>supra. </em>One was conducted on February 23, 1979.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">On that day , the Commission issued a \u201cNotice to the Parties\u201d which declined to determine that LEA (as a union) had violated \u00a7 9 A (a), but did conclude that \u201ca number of individual employees may have participated in a strike or induced [or] encouraged . . . a strike.\u201d Because the Committee\u2019s petition had not named the specific individuals who participated in illegal activities, and because those who had done so had been afforded no opportunity to defend against any charges, the Commission granted permission to the Committee to amend its petition, if it wished to to do so, \u201cto name specific individuals who may have participated in\u201d or assisted a work stoppage. The Committee did not amend its petition.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> No further proceedings were held by the Commission on the Committee\u2019s petition under \u00a7 9A <em>(b) </em>for an investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>February 16 was a Friday. The following week was a vacation week. On February 27, 1979, the Superintendent sent a memorandum to most (but not all) of the teachers who were absent on February 15 or 16, 1979, stating that the Committee on February 26 had voted to require a doctor\u2019s certificate from such absentees, and that such absentees \u201cwho do not present such a proof of illness\u201d would be \u201cdocked one day\u2019s pay.\u201d See G.L. c. 150E, \u00a7 15.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thereafter, on March 1, 1979, LEA filed a \u201ccharge of prohibited practice\u201d because of the requirement of a doctor\u2019s certificate from the absentees. The charge asserted that the requirement was \u201ca unilateral change [by the Committee] and contrary to the [existing] collective bargaining agreement [on sick leave] and past practice.\u201d LEA contended that there was \u201cno proof that there was a strike as defined in . . . \u00a7 9A and [that] as a result\u201d \u00a7 15 was not applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">As already stated, the \u201ccarry-over\u201d collective bargaining agreement contained a provision (art. XIV B) with respect to \u201cSick Leave\u201d that, \u201c[a]fter five (5) days of absence, the Committee shall have the right to require a doctor\u2019s certificate as proof of illness.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Committee, for an absence of less than five days, had not required such a certificate prior to the events of February, 1979.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>On May 1, 1979, after considering LEA\u2019s charge, the Commission issued a \u201ccomplaint of prohibited practice\u201d under G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 10(a) (5) and (1). On the basis of the Commission\u2019s recitation of the then past history of the constroversy, which does not appear to be controverted in relevant respects, many of the facts outlined above have been set forth.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">The Commission (then composed of Chairman Cooper and Commissioners Wooters and Dolan) issued its decision on November 13, 1979. It made findings essentially consistent with the circumstances already stated above.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Also, the Commission concluded that the Committee\u2019s requirement of physician\u2019s certificates from the February absentee teachers was reasonable in view of the strong statutory policy of c. 150E, \u00a7 9A (a). The commission\u2019s language is set out in full in the margin.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Commission then, on November 13, 1979, dismissed its own complaint of May 1, 1979, against the Committee.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>The LEA appealed to the Superior Court on December 7, 1979, for judicial review (then governed by G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 11, fourth par., as in effect prior to the transfer by St. 1981, c. 351, \u00a7 245, to this court of the duty of reviewing Commission actions). Before the Superior Court the Committee seems to have taken no direct part. It apparently relied upon the Commission\u2019s attorneys to uphold the Commission\u2019s 1979 decision. The proceedings in the Superior Court ended on July 11, 1983, when a judgment was entered directing that the Commission\u2019s decision of November 13, 1979, be \u201creversed and set aside as set out . . . in the transcript attached\u201d to the judgment \u201cand incorporated therein.\u201d The matter was remanded to the Commission \u201cfor proceedings not inconsistent with this judgment.\u201d That transcript is confusing but the judge\u2019s conclusion was that the Committee\u2019s action had been \u201cbeyond its power because it unilaterally abrogated the carryover provisions of the collective bargaining agreement ... in the absence of an <em>explicit finding </em>by the . . . Commission that there was a strike ... or a sickout\u201d (emphasis supplied). The Superior Court docket indicates that no appeal (even if claimed) from the judgment of reversal was ever prosecuted.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">After remand, the Commission (by two members, Chairman Edgar and Commissioner Walsh, neither of whom had participated in the Commission\u2019s 1979 decision) on January 30,1985, entered a new decision, which varied materially from the decisive language in the 1979 decision (quoted in note 8, <em>supra). </em>The new 19851 decision started afresh, reviewed the procedural history of the case at some length, made (apparently on the basis of evidence before the Commission in 1979) a new summary of facts deemed relevant, and rendered a new opinion, which concluded that the Committee had violated \u00a7\u00a7 10(a) (5) and (1) of G. L. c. 150E \u201cby unilaterally implementing a change in sick leave policy.\u201d It directed new relief designed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>\u201cto restore the status quo and to make affected employees whole.\u201d From the Commission\u2019s 1985 decision, the Committee has appealed to this court under the provisions of G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 11, as amended by St. 1981, c. 351, \u00a7 245. See now St. 1985, c. 330, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">1. We hold that the Superior Court judge\u2019s 1983 reversal of the Commission\u2019s 1979 decision was in error. The 1979 Commission was not required by G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 11, as it read in 1979,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> to make an explicit finding that a strike or illegal work stoppage had taken place. Its conclusion (quoted in note 8, supra) that \u201ccircumstances in this case . . . justify\u201d what had been done by the Committee, and that its requirement of a physician\u2019s certificate from absentees was \u201creasonable\u201d was sufficient indication that \u201cprohibited practice ha[d] not been . . . committed\u201d (see n. 9). The 1979 Commission\u2019s language, viewed in its entirety (upon ample evidence and subsidiary findings), in effect treated the events of February 15 and 16, 1979, as a \u201cwildcat\u201d work stoppage by individual teachers (not shown to have been fomented or condoned by LEA) in violation of the strong public policy against strikes and work stoppages by public employees. See G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 9A, note 2, <em>supra. </em>The Superior Court judge, by his reversal of the Commission\u2019s 1979 decision (accompanied by a highly ambiguous transcript), failed to recognize the significance of the quoted language in relation to the Commission\u2019s 1979 decision as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">Understandably, the Commission in 1985 may have been misled by the judge\u2019s action. It also may have felt constrained by his action to reach a new and different conclusion. This court, however, as an appellate court, is not compelled to treat the earlier erroneous decision of the Superior Court judge in the same cause as binding us (as the \u201claw of the case\u201d or otherwise). This is so even if no appeal was taken to this court from that decision. \u201c[I]f we are satisfied that a previous holding in the same case was in error, we have not only the right, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>sometimes the duty, to make correction.\u201d <em>Gleason </em>v. <em>Hardware Mut. Cas. Co., </em>331 Mass. 703, 710 (1954), where there is ample citation of pertinent authority. That such a power exists (even as to an earlier decision of the same appellate court) has been recognized as recently as <em>New England Merchs. Natl. Bank </em>v. <em>Old Colony Trust Co., </em>385 Mass. 24, 26 (1982, although in that case, the power was not exercised, because the court was \u201csatisfied with . . . [its] previous ruling\u201d). See <em>Rager </em>v. <em>McCloskey, </em>305 N.Y. 75, 78 (1953). See also <em>Relph </em>v. <em>Board of Educ. of DePue Unit Sch. Dist. No. 103, </em>84 Ill. 2d 436, 442 (1981, where it was said that, on \u201cthe first time ... [a case has] been before\u201d an appellate court, that court\u2019s \u201creview may cover all matters properly raised and passed on in the course of [the] litigation\u201d).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">In the <em>Gleason </em>case, 331 Mass. at 710, it was recognized that the rule of that case represents a somewhat infrequent variation from \u201cthe practice of courts generally to refuse to reopen what has been decided\u201d but that such a variation was applied there, because to do otherwise would \u201clead to injustice.\u201d So far as correcting the Superior Court judge\u2019s error now may involve a matter of discretion, we think that various considerations require it: (1) The reversal of the 1979 Commission decision has obviously resulted in a misleading precedent. (2) The Commission in 1985, in attempting to meet the reversal remand by changing the 1979 result, has wrongly decided that \u201c[t]he evidence presented in this case is insufficient to find that a strike occurred or was about to occur\u201d on either February 15 or 16, 1979.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> (3) The effect of judicial decisions since <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>1979 has been disregarded in consequence of the error.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> (4) Considerations of efficient court administration support correcting now the erroneous reversal of the Commission\u2019s 1979 decision.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In view of these considerations, we do not treat the erroneous 1983 reversal as establishing the law of this case and proceed now to correct that reversal.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">2. For reasons already stated, we set aside the 1985 decision and order of the Commission and direct that the Commission\u2019s original 1979 decision (in effect that the Committee\u2019s actions in February, 1979, were reasonable) be reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b266-6\"> Section 9A, as inserted by St. 1973, c. 1078, \u00a7 2, reads (emphasis supplied): <em>\u201c(a) </em>No <em>public employee </em>or employee organization shall engage in a strike, and no public employee or employee organization shall induce, encourage or condone any strike, <em>work stoppage, </em>slowdown or <em>withholding of services </em>by such public employees, <em>(b) </em>Whenever <em>a strike occurs or is about to occur, </em>the employer shall petition the commission to make an investigation. If, after investigation, the commission determines that any provision of paragraph <em>(a) </em>of this section has been or is about to be violated, it shall immediately set requirements that must be complied with, including, but not limited to, instituting appropriate proceedings in the superior court for the county wherein such violation has occurred or is about to occur for enforcement of such requirements.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b267-6\"> The letter, an effort at \u201cself-help\u201d because of an apparent \u201cwork stoppage,\u201d read: \u201cThe School Committee has reason to believe that the Leominister Teachers and the LEA are participating in a scheduled \u2018sick-out\u2019 which began on February 15, 1979. . . . [The letter then referred to \u00a7 9A, see note 2, supra.] Unless this action ceases immediately, the . . . Committee shall take the following actions: (1) The School Committee shall notify the Labor Relations Commission of the threat of a work stoppage, and ... the . . . committee expects that . . . the . . . Commission will immediately investigate . . ., issue orders to the teachers, and obtain a Court injunction if necessary. (2) We may require verified physician\u2019s statements for all employees who are absent from school. (3) No compensation shall be paid for the day missed, in appropriate cases .... (4) The . . . Committee shall take appropriate disciplinary action which may result in the suspension and termination of teachers.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b267-7\"> We perceive nothing which required the Commission, on a \u00a7 9A investigation, to be informed of the names of all the individual participants in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>what appeared to be a \u201cwildcat\u201d work stoppage, but perhaps it was not intended that all participants be named. Indeed, in such a work stoppage involving a large number of public employees, any requirement that the names of all or substantially all individual participants be furnished might be unreasonably cumbersome and delay quick resumption of an important public service.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b268-10\"> General Laws c. 150E, \u00a7 15, inserted by St. 1973, c. 1078, \u00a7 2, included a provision reading: \u201cNo compensation shall be paid by an employer to an employee with respect to any day or part thereof when such employee is engaged in a strike against said employer, nor shall such employee be eligible to recover such compensation at a later date in the event that such employee is required to work additional days to fulfill the provisions of [a] collective bargaining agreement.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b268-11\"> The purpose of this provision appears to have been to allow, as a matter of trust of the teachers, a few days of absence for genuine illness, and to avoid, for school officials and teachers alike, the administrative inconvenience and expense of physician\u2019s certificates for short, routine, genuine illness-caused absences. Such certificates were required, however, for longer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>lasting situations. Nothing in this record suggests that art. XTV B was intended to afford teachers an opportunity for coordinated \u201csick-leave\u201d absenteeism for less than five days, not really caused by illness, which could not be checked by school officials. Article XIV B, if so interpreted, would be clearly contrary to the public policy set out in G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7\u00a7 9A and 15 (see notes 2 and 5, <em>supra).</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b269-12\"> As to the work stoppage on February 15 and 16, 1979, the Commission found that \u201capproximately 95 of the 400 classroom teachers . . . called in sick,\u201d and that at one school \u201c[o]n February 15, all 15 teachers were absent\u201d and at another school, nineteen were absent. \u201cMost of the teachers who were absent on February 15th were present on February 16th and vice versa.\u201d It also found, among other matters, (a) that the Superintendent\u2019s memorandum of February 27 was sent to teachers in seven of thirteen schools in the city \u201ceven though teachers were absent from other schools during the days in question\u201d; (b) that the Committee offered LEA no opportunity to bargain over the requirement of a doctor\u2019s certificate justifying an absence on February 15 or 16; and (c) that about sixty \u201cteachers who failed to produce adequate excuses for their absences on February 15 or 16 were docked one day of pay.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b269-13\"> \u201cWe find circumstances in this case which justify what in other cases would be an unlawful unilateral change in sick leave policy. In this case the requirement that teachers who called in sick be required to produce physicians\u2019 statements is reasonable <em>in view of the statutory policy against public employee strikes </em>as enunciated in Section 9A (a) [see note 2, <em>supra] </em>. . . and the need, in light of Section 15 [see note 5, <em>supra], </em>to permit a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>logical and fair way of enforcing the [l]aw. In this case teachers knew since November, 1978, that the. .. Committee might require physicians\u2019 excuses if it believed a \u2018sick-out\u2019 occurred. Further, the Superintendent was flexible as to the form of excuse ultimately accepted from teachers who called in sick.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b271-7\"> The pertinent language of \u00a7 11, then read (as amended through St. 1977, c. 788), \u201cIf, upon all of the testimony, the commission determines that a prohibited practice has not been or is not being committed, it shall state its findings of fact and shall issue an order dismissing the complaint.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b272-6\"> For other authorities, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ackers, </em>343 Mass. 63, 68 (1961); <em>Sjostrom </em>v. <em>Sproule, </em>33 Ill. 2d 40, 41 (1965), 18 Wright &amp; Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 4478 (1981 &amp; Supp. 1985); IB Moore\u2019s Federal Practice par. 0.404 (2d ed. 1984 &amp; Supp. 1984-85).

XIV of the collective bargaining agreement. See note 6, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b273-8\"> Recent cases (one decided after the Superior Court had reversed the Commission\u2019s 1979 decision, and the other decided only a month earlier) show that, faced with an illegal work stoppage, the Committee reasonably could meet the stoppage by \u201cself-help\u201d without awaiting any Commission determination under G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 9A. Such prompt action may be the most suitable way to prevent \u201cthe disruption of any essential public service, including public education.\u201d <em>Lenox Educ.
