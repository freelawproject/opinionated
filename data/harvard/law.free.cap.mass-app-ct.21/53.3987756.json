We vacate the judgment so that the matter may be reconsidered by the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">1. <em>The case. </em>The plaintiff\u2019s house was originally one of ten similar units of a \u201ccottage colony\u201d bounded by Sea Shells Drive and Sea Mist Lane, South Chatham, comprising a total area of some 80,000 square feet. Evidently the colony was owned by one person or entity which used to rent the cottages for summer occupancy. On March 13, 1976, the colony was \u201ccondominiumized\u201d pursuant to G. L. c. 183A, and on November 9, 1976, the plaintiffs bought the particular cottage for a stated price.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Under the deed, the plaintiffs secured title to the one-story, single-family, frame structure and its underlying land (the \u201cfootprint\u201d) plus a ten percent undivided interest in the \u201ccommon areas and facilities\u201d of the former colony (the areas other than the footprints of the ten units). By the terms of the deed, the units are subject to the restriction that they are intended \u201cfor recreational and vacation uses, and may not be used as permanent year-round residences.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">The house is nonconforming (as are the others in the condominium). Town by-law 1.46, enacted in 1978, states with respect to a cottage colony converted to a condominium that \u201cthe lot upon which each condominium unit is located\u201d shall have a \u201c[l]ot area, minimum\u201d of 15,000 square feet if the lot is \u201cnot provided with either public water or sewer.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The plaintiffs\u2019 lot has neither. By-law 1.46 has other requirements such as minimum lot frontage, minimum front and rear yard, minimum side yard, roadway access, off-street parking space, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>approval of the sewage disposal system by the board of health. Although the present record lacks detail, we are to assume that there is nonconformity with respect to some of these requirements if only because of the nature of the plaintiffs\u2019 ownership.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">In August, 1980, the plaintiffs applied to the local building inspector for a permit to add (in effect) a livable second story to their house. More particularly, they proposed to raise a dormer \u2014 to swing it up as if hinged, as counsel put it \u2014 and enlarge what was probably an attic crawl space to encompass a living area of 320 square feet, with, in addition, a deck of 78 square feet. These additions compare with a living area of 789 square feet on the floor below. Starting with three bedrooms, bath, living room, and kitchen, on the one floor, the proposed rearrangement would yield two bedrooms, bath, living room, dining room, and kitchen on the first floor, and one bedroom, bath, den, and deck on the second.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">The building inspector granted the permit on August 25, 1980. However, a neighbor protested, and when the alterations were perhaps 80 to 90 percent complete at a cost of $6,105.30, the building inspector issued a stop-work order, and by letter of October 26, 1980, informed the plaintiffs that in his opinion they must apply to the board for a special permit. Similar stop-work orders and letters were sent to two other house owners in the condominium.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-8\">The plaintiffs applied to the board, which, at an open meeting on February 25,1981, following a public hearing, unanimously denied the request for a special permit. By letter of March 11, 1981, the board set out its reasons. Upon the plaintiffs\u2019 \u201cappeal\u201d under G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17, a judge of the Superior Court upon findings and rulings held the board\u2019s action to be not arbitrary or capricious or in excess of its authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-10\">2. <em>Statutory framework. </em>The relevant provisions of The Zoning Act are the first two sentences of G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 6, as appearing in St. 1975, c. 808, \u00a7 3, reproduced as an appendix to this opinion.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> These are as difficult and infelicitous as other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>language of the act recently reviewed,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> but we think it is possible to say the following. An alteration, reconstruction, extension, or structural change of a nonconforming single-family or two-family residential structure is legitimated under the second \u201cexcept\u201d clause of the first sentence if it \u201cdoes not increase the nonconforming nature of said structure\u201d; otherwise (as occurs in certain events in regard to changes of other structures referred to in the language preceding the \u201cexcept\u201d clause), it must be submitted to the special permit procedure of the second sentence for a determination by the board of the question whether it is \u201csubstantially more detrimental than the existing nonconforming use to the neighborhood.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">There can be argument that the present case does not fit the \u201cexcept\u201d clause at all because, for purposes of that text, the structure is still a cottage, or at least not a single-family structure, which ordinarily assumes ownership of some verge of land, with definite bounds, beyond the footprint, and also assumes (though more doubtfully) a right to occupancy year-round. From another angle there can be argument that, if the plaintiffs intended to insist that their alteration was within the \u201cexcept\u201d clause, they must refrain from applying for a special permit, and await or undertake independent litigation. However, we think it right to proceed on the basis that the plaintiffs\u2019 house is a single-family structure in relation to the \u201cexcept\u201d clause, and that the plaintiffs\u2019 application to the board may (and as a matter of procedural economy should) combine a contention that the alteration is validated by the \u201cexcept\u201d clause with a request (failing that contention) that the board grant a special permit after considering \u201cdetrimental\u201d effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">3. <em>Inadequate treatment by the board. </em>In this view (to repeat), the board should first have considered whether the alteration fit the \u201cexcept\u201d clause and, if the answer was no, gone on to the question of \u201cdetriment.\u201d But, judging by the board\u2019s letter of March 11, 1981, it did not address itself to the first question, and made a dubious approach to the second.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>(a) The plaintiffs urge as matter of law that the \u201cexcept\u201d clause applies; that the \u201cnonconforming nature\u201d of their structure relates to density, as expressed in the minimum lot size requirement of by-law 1.46, and that this \u201cnature\u201d cannot be considered \u201cincreased\u201d when the alteration reaches upward rather than laterally, with the structure remaining single-family, although much enlarged. We think it would be unwise for the court to decide this question of the application of the \u201cexcept\u201d clause as if it presented a nice legal point upon a motion to dismiss an action for failure to state a claim. A local board of appeals brings to the matter an intimate understanding of the immediate circumstances, of local conditions, and of the background and purposes of the entire by-law; and so, at least in the first instance, the board\u2019s administrative view is valuable and is wanted. Cf. <em>Subaru of New </em>England, <em>Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Canton, </em>8 Mass. App. Ct. 483, 486-488 (1979); <em>Geryk </em>v. <em>Zoning Appeals Board of Easthampton, </em>8 Mass. App. Ct. 683, 684-685 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">(b) The board went immediately to the issue of \u201cdetriment\u201d.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The reasons it assigned are unsatisfactory. It interjected as a factor that, if the present application for a special permit were granted, it would be difficult in the future to refuse the plaintiffs permission for year-round occupancy.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We think the board erred when it took into account, as bearing upon present decision, a putative problem to be faced in the indefinite future upon now uncertain facts. See <em>Mahoney </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Winchester, </em>344 Mass. 598, 601 (1962). On the other hand, we venture to think that the board, if it thought it helpful, would be entitled to consider the present application as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>bellwether of other applications, since stop-work orders were issued to two other houseowners. The board spoke of several factors besides lot size \u2014 summer parking problems, sewage difficulties, abutter objections to increase of \u201cpeople density\u201d \u2014 but it is hard to say whether these comments envisaged prospective year-round utilization or were considered pertinent even if occupancy remained limited to the summer season.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">The foregoing discussion also serves as an answer to the findings and rulings of the judge below.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">The judgment of the Superior Court is vacated with directions to that court to remand the matter to the board for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b78-8\">Appendix.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-9\">\u201cSection 6. Except as hereinafter provided, a zoning ordinance or by-law shall not apply to structures or uses lawfully in existence or lawfully begun, or to a building or special permit issued before the first publication of notice of the public hearing on such ordinance or by-law required by section five, but shall apply to any change or substantial extension of such use, to a building or special permit issued after the first notice of said public hearing, to any reconstruction, extension or structural change of such structure and to any alteration of a structure begun after the first notice of said public hearing to provide for its use for a substantially different purpose or for the same purpose in a substantially different manner or to a substantially greater extent except where alteration, reconstruction, extension or structural change to a single or two-family residential structure does not increase the nonconforming nature of said structure. Pre-existing nonconforming structures or uses may be extended or altered, provided, that no such extension or alteration shall be permitted unless there is a finding by the permit granting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>authority or by the special permit granting authority designated by ordinance or by-law that such change, extension or alteration shall not be substantially more detrimental than the existing nonconforming use to the neighborhood.\u201d</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b74-7\"> The condominium is called \u201cStandish Village\u201d and the plaintiffs\u2019 house \u201cJohn Alden.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b74-8\"> The units are also subject to the provisions of the master deed and the condominium trust (including the trust by-laws), but neither instrument was offered in evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b74-9\">Nonconformity is evident even if 80,000 is arbitrarily divided by ten, without regard to any distinction between fee ownership and partial undivided ownership.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b75-11\"> By-laws 1.41 and 1.42 regarding nonconformity appear to be glosses on the statute and need not be separately considered.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b76-7\"> See <em>O\u2019Kane </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Hingham, </em>20 Mass.

They cite <em>Marblehead </em>v. <em>Deery, </em>356 Mass. 532 (1969), but that case is a special and singular example of circumstances warranting a limitation, reflecting equitable considerations, of the principle that forbids estopping a municipality because of the act of one of its officials.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
