Judge Lasser thus was not called upon to determine whether some procedural remedy should be fashioned to avoid the burden of multiple and duplicative litigations. <em>Cf. Exxon Corp. v. Tp. of East Brunswick, </em>192 <em>N.J.Super. </em>329 (App.Div.1983), certif. den. 96 <em>N.J. </em>312 (1984). We leave that question, together with the jurisdiction question, to another day and another case.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
