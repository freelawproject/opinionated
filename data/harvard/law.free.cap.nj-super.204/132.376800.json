Jaworski, </em>Deputy Attorney General, on the brief).</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b164-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">This is an appeal from a final administrative decision of the Division of Public Welfare, Department of Human Services (Department), which affirmed the action of the Gloucester County Welfare Board (Board) in terminating appellant\u2019s benefits under the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program. Termination of the grant was based upon a determination by the Board that no parental deprivation such as required by <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:81-2.7(d) existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">Appellant, Kimberly Souder, an unwed mother, and her son reside with her family. She received AFDC because the child was financially needy and deprived within the meaning of that program. She had been receiving $278 per month under AFDC-C. Appellant\u2019s benefits were terminated because in a telephone conversation with a representative of the Board on April 6, 1982 she told him that the child was visited by his father every day.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">On April 7,1982, appellant was notified by the Board that her monthly AFDC benefits of $278 would be terminated because \u201cyour child is visited by his father every day ... [so] that there is no absent parent [within the meaning of <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:81-2.-7(d)].\u201d In its termination letter it advised appellant that she could qualify for other types of public assistance if she married the father and lived with him or took up a joint residence with him as unmarried parents of the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">Appellant requested a fair hearing and the matter was heard by an Administrative Law Judge (AU). At the hearing the Board took the position that because of the substantial contact by the father with the child, who was 13 months old at the time of redetermination, the child was \u201cno longer deprived of parental support.\u201d Prior to the hearing appellant told the Board that she was engaged to the child\u2019s father but would not marry him until he obtained a better job. Subsequent to the hearing she advised the Board that she and the father were no longer engaged.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>At the time of the hearing the father was paying support of $15 per week pursuant to a court order. He was earning $3.50 an hour as a truck driver working seasonally only. The Board explained that married and unmarried parents were treated alike under AFDC and at the hearing suggested that appellant and the father reside together as a family unit so that they might qualify for assistance as a family. The Board assumed that because of the visitation the father was functioning as a parent. This was concluded even though the Board representative admitted that since the support was under a court order the father would be given the right of visitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">At the hearing appellant stated that the father, who lived two blocks away from where she resided, visited the child for an hour each day to play with him. She denied that he had any control or say over the child\u2019s upbringing. She stated that she could not move in and live with the father because it would be against the father\u2019s religion. Appellant\u2019s family also was opposed to a \u201clive in\u201d relationship. This \u201clive in\u201d suggestion by the Board upset appellant\u2019s relationship with her family and interfered with the relationship with the child\u2019s father.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">Based on this testimony the ALJ concluded that appellant\u2019s benefits were properly terminated. The AU found that: (1) the father paid $15 per week in support and these payments were current; (2) the father visited the child daily; and (3) the father and the appellant were having a \u201ccontinuing relationship.\u201d He concluded that termination was proper because the child was \u201cnot deprived of parental support and care.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">On this appeal we are required to determine whether, under the facts and circumstances of this case, appellant\u2019s AFDC benefits were properly terminated. For reasons set forth below we hold that the benefits were improperly terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-9\">Appellant states that \u201c[i]t has been well established that eligibility under the AFDC must be measured by federal standards.\u201d This, of course, is axiomatic. If a state AFDC regulation conflicts with a federal standard, that regulation is invalid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>under the supremacy clause. <em>Carleson v. Remillard, </em>406 <em>U.S. </em>598, 600-603, 92 <em>S.Ct. </em>1932, 1934-1935, 32 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>352 (1972). If New Jersey disagrees with the manner in which the federal government has established eligibility criteria for AFDC and the manner in which these standards are applied, it must take its grievances to Congress, not apply those regulations in conformity with its own policy. <em>King v. Smith, </em>392 <em>U.S. </em>309, 333, 88 <em>S.Ct. </em>2128, 2141, 20 L.Ed.2d 1118 (1968). This State must conform its AFDC program to the federal scheme. <em>Essex Cty. Welfare Bd. v. Dept. of Inst. and Agencies, </em>139 <em>N.J.Super. </em>47, 50 (App.Div.1976); see 42 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 601, <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">Appellant contends that the Department interprets and applies the State regulations so as to undermine the purpose and intent of the Social Security Act. She charges that the Department\u2019s test for determining whether there is continued absence of a parent is based merely on whether the <em>opportunity </em>to exercise parental responsibility exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">This court has recently held, contrary to the Department\u2019s contention, that Eligibility for AFDC Benefits, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:81\u2014 2.7(d), is not determined on the basis of whether an absent parent has the <em>opportunity </em>to exercise parental responsibility irrespective of the parent\u2019s physical presence in the home. <em>Simone v. State, </em>191 <em>N.J.Super. </em>228, 233 (App.Div.1983). The regulation expressly directs that continued absence of the parent from the home constitutes deprivation of parental support or care, without any qualification respecting the opportunity of the parent to exercise responsibility regardless of the absence. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">The Department contends that the narrow issue is whether the child is \u201cdeprived\u201d within the meaning of the AFDC legislation. It concludes that this court\u2019s review is limited to ascertaining whether the agency decision is based upon sufficient credible evidence in the record as a whole. \u201cSince the father lives nearby and visits frequently to play with the child,\u201d it maintains that \u201che can be counted upon should she or the child <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>need his assistance for any reason.\u201d The father\u2019s \u201cdaily presence in the home coupled with the care and support he has shown to the child ... negate a finding either that his absence interrupts his role as a provider of \u2018maintenance, physical care, or guidance\u2019 for the child or renders him unable to plan for the child\u2019s support or care.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">Initially, it is necessary to review the applicable statutes and regulations. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:81-1.11(a)(1) provides financial assistance for children and their parents with whom they are living when they are financially eligible and there is death, absence or incapacity of one or both parents. 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 606(a) defines a dependent child as a needy child \u201cwho has been deprived of parental support or care by reason of the ... continued absence from the home ... of a parent.\u201d In the present case, the need of appellant\u2019s child is not disputed. 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 233.90(c)(1)(iii) (1982) states that \u201ccontinued absence ... constitutes the reason for deprivation of parental support or care when the parent is <em>out of the home\u201d, </em>(emphasis supplied). The absence must, however, interrupt or terminate the parent\u2019s functioning as a provider of maintenance, physical care <em>or </em>guidance for the child.\u201d (emphasis supplied). Finally, \u201cthe known or indefinite duration of the absence ... [must preclude] counting on the parent\u2019s performance of the function of the planning for the present support or care of the child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">New Jersey\u2019s regulations reflect the federal counterparts and facially are in full compliance with them. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:81-2.7(d) (Public Assistance Manual \u00a7 2533) (PAM) defines continuous absence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-8\">... when it interrupts or terminates the parent\u2019s functioning as a provider for <em>maintenance, physical care or guidance for the child, </em>and the known or indefinite duration of the absence precludes the parent\u2019s performance of his/her function in planning for the present support or care of the child. If these conditions exist, the parent may be absent for any reason, and he/she may have left only recently or sometime previously, (emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b167-9\">The preceding regulation establishes that absence means that a parent is out of the home for any reason, or as conversely stated by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Carleson v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number><em>Remillard, supra, </em>406 <em>U.S. </em>at 602-603, 92 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1935: \u201c[t]he <em>presence </em>in the home of the parent who has the legal obligation to support is the key to the AFDC program.\u201d (emphasis supplied)</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">In support of its position, the Department relies principally upon <em>Simone v. Division of Public Welfare, supra, Shannon v. Department of Human Services, </em>157 <em>N.J.Super. </em>251 (App.Div.1978) and two unpublished decisions of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">In <em>Shannon </em>the evidence indicated that the father was actually living with the family unit because: (1) the father\u2019s mail was received at the recipient\u2019s address; (2) the utilities were billed in his name; (3) the house was leased in his name; (4) his driver\u2019s license and automobile registration were listed at the mother\u2019s address; and (5) a letter sent to the father\u2019s reported address was returned marked \u201cno forwarding address.\u201d <em>Shannon, supra, </em>at 253. While the Director of Welfare accepted the mother\u2019s explanations and concluded that the father was not living with the family unit, he affirmed a reduction in the recipient\u2019s benefits because the child could not be considered deprived \u201cof parental care [and] support\u201d since the father frequently visited the child. <em>Id. </em>at 254.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">In <em>Shannon </em>we remanded for a hearing concerning the length and frequency of the father\u2019s visits to determine whether his absence \u201cwas \u2018continued\u2019 within the meaning of PAM 2533.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 258. If there exists a pattern of frequent visitation, <em>Shannon </em>supports the Director\u2019s interpretation that these visits, under the facts and circumstances of that case, negate \u201cone condition for eligibility under the AFDC program, continued absence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 255.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-8\">In <em>Simone </em>we held, contrary to the Director\u2019s contention, that Eligibility for AFDC Benefits, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:81-2.7(d), is not determined on the basis of whether an absent parent has the <em>opportunity </em>to exercise parental responsibility irrespective of the parent\u2019s physical presence in the home. <em>Simone, supra, </em>191 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 233. <em>Simone </em>noted that the regulation ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>pressly directs that continued absence of the parent from the home constitutes deprivation of parental support or care, without any qualification respecting the opportunity of the parent to exercise responsibility regardless of the absence. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">Here we hold, in conformity with <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 233.-90(c)(1)(iii) (1982), that a parent is absent when the absence interrupts or terminates the parent\u2019s function as a provider of maintenance, physical care <em>or </em>guidance for the child. Moreover, in accordance with <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:81-2.7(d) the known or indefinite duration of the absence must preclude the parent\u2019s performance or function in planning for the present support or care of the child. But, a pattern of frequent visitations is relevant evidence for evaluating eligibility or ineligibility under AFDC but in itself is not a reason for termination. Visits weigh on the issue of whether the absent parent\u2019s ability to perform certain defined functions within the family unit have been interrupted or terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">In <em>Freeman v. Lukhard, </em>465 <em>F.Supp. </em>1269 (E.D.Va.1979) the United States District Court was confronted with the problem of whether an absent parent contributed to the physical care, maintenance and guidance of the children. \u201c[I]f the absent parent provides any amount of all three, however small, the child is ineligible for AFDC benefits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1271. In <em>Freeman, </em>the youngest children were declared ineligible for AFDC because their father not only visited them daily but also because he took an active role in planning for their daily care, and provided them with diapers and milk. <em>Ibid. </em>Despite this, the United States District Court stated the proper test to be applied for a child to be eligible for AFDC-C is: \u201c[i]f the absent parent completely fails to provide <em>any one of the three.\u201d Id. </em>at 1271 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-8\"><em>Freeman </em>recognizes that the child is not deprived or dependent within the meaning of 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 606(a) if the absent parent frequently visits with his children and contributes in any small way to that child\u2019s maintenance, guidance <em>and </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>support. <em>Shannon, </em>in essence, states that an absent parent who visits his children frequently may be constructively present within the family, and, therefore, not absent for AFDC-C purposes. As we previously pointed out, eligibility for AFDC-C benefits is not determined on the basis of whether the absent parent has the opportunity to exercise parental responsibility irrespective of the parent\u2019s physical presence in the home. <em>Simone v. State, supra, </em>191 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 233.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">Next we turn to advisory opinions received by State officials from the Federal Office of Family Assistance (See <em>Simone v. State, supra, </em>191 <em>N.J.Super. </em>233-234 n. 2).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">In 1978 the Director of New Jersey\u2019s Division of Public Welfare, (Director) requested a legal opinion from the federal agency on the \u201cmeaning of the AFDC eligibility requirement that a needy child \u2018be deprived of parental support or care by reason of the ... continued absence from the home ... of the parent.\u2019 \u201d Apparently the Director indicated in his request that he interpreted this proviso to mean that a parent who frequently visited the home or had frequent contact with the children was not absent within the meaning of AFDC, and that the children were not deprived within the meaning of that program.</p>\n<p id=\"Asb\">The federal agency responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-7\">We have been advised that this approach improperly constricts the definition of \u201ccontinued absence\u201d as set forth in 45 <em>C.F.R. </em>233.90(c)(1)(iii) and is at odds with the underlying spirit and purpose of the AFDC program.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">After reviewing the language contained in 45 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 233.-90(c)(1)(iii), the opinion reasoned that, if a parent is out of the home, the child is eligible for AFDC and deprived if that absence terminates or interrupts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-9\">(2) ... the parent\u2019s functioning as a provider of maintenance!,] physical care <em>or </em>guidance of the child, <em>and</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-10\">(3) The known or indefinite duration of the absence precludes counting on the parent\u2019s performance of his function in planning for the present support <em>or </em>care of the child (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-11\">The opinion then advises:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-12\">... it is important to note that requirements \u201c2\u201d and \u201c3\u201d above are both worded in a disjunctive. Thus requirement \u201c2\u201d will be satisfied if either the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>parent\u2019s ability to provide for maintenance and physical care or his ability to provide guidance is disrupted by the character of the absence. Similarly, if the absence precludes planning either for the present suppor [sic] or the care of the child, the requirement is satisfied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">The opinion unequivocally advised the Director that his interpretation was \u201cclearly at odds with Federal regulations\u201d. It noted that the:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-7\">... Federal regulations established a strict standard for considering the availability of parents [sic] income for the support of his children. Section 45 <em>C.F.R. </em>233.20(a)(3)(vi)(b) provides that in establishing eligibility and the amount of payment:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-8\">... In family groups living together income of the spouse is considered available for his spouse and income from a parent is considered available for children under age 21.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-9\">Thus when the parent is not present in the home his income cannot be considered available to his family. Instead the caretaker is required to assign support rights to the Title IV-D agency, and only such part of the absent parent\u2019s income which is actually contributed can be taken into account. The family continues to be eligible for assistance except in certain situations where the absent parent\u2019s contribution exceeds the agency\u2019s need standard.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-10\">The letter opinion continues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-11\">... Additionally, to equate \u2018visiting\u2019 with \u2018living with\u2019 could further disrupt an already troubled family situation. Continued parental involvement is to be encouraged by the AFDC program premising a finding of ineligibility on the fact of visitation standing alone has the opposite effect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-12\">and then concludes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-13\">We trust you will take prompt action to correct these unacceptale practices. You may also wish to review fair hearing decisions which have involved this issue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-14\">In 1982 a New Jersey deputy attorney general requested an opinion from the federal Office of Family Assistance<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> presenting the same question posed by the Director four years earlier. The cover letter sent to him highlighted the contents of the memorandum forwarded to him (prepared in 1982 at the request of the State of Washington) and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-15\">As the memorandum notes, the regulation does not require a total cessation of the parent\u2019s contact with his/her children for a finding of \u201ccontinued absence.\u201d Therefore frequent visits, in and of themselves, do not negate a finding of deprivation by reason of absence. The criterion is whether the absence of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>parent interrupts his/her functionings as a provider of maintenance, physical care or guidance and whether the duration of absence precludes the parent\u2019s performance of his/her function in planning for the present support or care of the child.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">The memorandum essentially restates the interpretation contained in the 1978 opinion provided the Director. The question posed was \u201cto what extent absent parents can maintain contact with their families and still be considered \u2018absent\u2019 for eligibility purposes and whether the parent can be considered to have ceased to provide maintenance, care or guidance to the child when there are continuing contacts with the child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">The opinion responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-7\">The provisions [45 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 233.90(1)(c)(iii)] does not require a total cessation of the parent\u2019s contact with his/her children for a finding of \u201ccontinued absence\u201d. It is recognized that the absent parent may be an important influence in the life of the child and some contacts between the parent and the child are consistent with the purpose of the AFDC program as specified in section 401 of the Act \u201cto help maintain and strengthen family life\u201d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b172-8\">We conclude that the policy of the Department to terminate AFDC benefits upon a mere showing of a frequent pattern of visits between the absent parent and the child is improper. This practice impermissibly imposes a restriction upon eligibility greater than anticipated in the federal regulation, <em>Carleson v. Remillard, supra, </em>406 <em>U.S. </em>598 at 600-603, 92 <em>S.Ct. </em>1932 at 1934-1935, 32 L.Ed.2d 352 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-9\">In <em>Shannon, </em>we remanded to the Director to investigate the length and frequency of the visits and \u201cany other matter deemed relevant to a determination as to whether ... absence ... was continued within the meaning of PAM 2533.\u201d 157 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 258. In other words, there must be a showing that the absent parent continued to function as a parent as defined in the regulation. We hold that frequent visits in and of themselves do not negate a finding of absence under AFDC. The mere opportunity to function as a parent is an improper criterion. <em>Simone, supra, </em>191 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 233. To terminate because of an ongoing relationship between the absent parent and his child, the Department must demonstrate that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>absence does not interrupt or terminate \u201cthe parent\u2019s functioning as a provider of maintenance, physical care, or guidance for the child, and the known or indefinite duration of the absence precludes counting on the parent\u2019s performance of the function of planning for present support or care of the child.\u201d 45 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 233.90(c)(1)(iii). The absent parent must be fulfilling his parental role to disqualify the child from benefits under the AFDC program. In anticipation of this conclusion, the Department argues that as a matter of established facts the absent parent \u201cdoes provide both care and financial support on a regular, indeed, a daily, basis.\u201d It points out that the father lives two blocks away from his child and visits him daily and notes that he has a continuing relationship with the child\u2019s mother. It contends that the fact the father cares for his child means that appellant can count on him for the present support or care of the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">The Board\u2019s representatives testified at trial that they terminated benefits because appellant had a continuing relationship with the child\u2019s father, and the father visited with the child daily. When asked how it determined whether the absent parent was functioning as a parent, the Board\u2019s administrative supervisor stated: \u201cWell he is ... he is there every day to see the child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">The Board offered no other evidence nor produced any witnesses. The father was not called to testify, nor was any member of appellant\u2019s family or others who might have been familiar with the situation. Apparently, no investigation was conducted. It is clear that the Board terminated benefits because the father was paying support and daily visiting his child. There was no evidence, let alone sufficient credible evidence, that the father provided maintenance, physical care and guidance for the child and could be counted on in planning for the present support or care of that child.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">The ALJ found that: (1) the father paid support and that those payments were current; (2) the father visited the child <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>daily for an hour; and (3) he maintained a continuing relationship with appellant. Based on these findings he concluded that the child was \u201cnot deprived of parental support or care.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">The standard for appellate review of an administrative agency is whether the findings made could reasonably have been reached on sufficient credible evidence present in the record considering the proofs as a whole. <em>Close v. Kordulak Bros., </em>44 <em>N.J. </em>589, 599 (1965). In this case such evidence does not exist. These findings, adopted by the Department, are insufficient to support termination of the benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b171-16\">See <em>Simone v.
