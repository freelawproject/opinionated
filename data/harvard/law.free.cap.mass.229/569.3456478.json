Before February, 1913, she saw in the \u201cSaturday Evening Post\u201d an advertisement of the North American Construction Company concerning the \u201cAladdin house or Aladdin system\u201d of partly made houses, and also an advertisement by the construction company entitled \u201cHow to Beat the Building Game.\u201d Mrs. Heathcote wrote to the construction company, which replied to her letter, and on May 29, 1913, ordered from it \u201ca Marsden (Aladdin) House\u201d for the sum of $1,464.90.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-8\">The parts of the house arrived at West Newton soon after July 29, 1913, and were taken to the land of the deceased. There was evidence that no plan was received indicating where the parts could be found, or instructions showing how the work was to be carried on; and that it required a skilled carpenter to construct the house. There was- also evidence of deficiency in material; that some of the parts did not fit; that the building material was not as represented; and that in other respects the North American Construction Company had failed to carry out its contract. When the construction company learned that some of the flooring was missing, it authorized the plaintiff to purchase it at the expense of the company. In December, 1913, the plaintiff wrote to the company \u201cstating the items that were short,\u201d and later, in settlement of the claim, received from it a check for $69 which he refused to accept.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-9\">The declaration is in four counts: the first alleges a breach of the contract of the defendant, in guaranteeing the \u201chonesty, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>integrity, [jtnd] trustworthiness \u201d of its advertisers, to the loss and damage of the plaintiff; the second and third are based upon the implied contract in holding out the defendant\u2019s advertisers as trustworthy, and its duty to use proper care to \u201cinvestigate the truth of said recommendation; \u201d the fourth sets out the defendant\u2019s fraud. At the close of the evidence the judge directed a verdict for the defendant and reported the case to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-3\">While there was evidence that the North American Construction Company failed to perform its contract with the plaintiff\u2019s intestate, there was no evidence that this company was engaged in a fraudulent business, was financially irresponsible or was in the habit of intentionally deceiving people. The editorial was not strictly a guarantee to answer for the debt or default of another, and it contained no words indicating such an intention; it was in effect merely a recommendation of its advertisers. \u201cThe integrity of its advertising\u201d and \u201cguaranteed ... to he honest and trustworthy,\u201d indicate no more than this: that its advertisers can be depended upon as reliable and honest. A statement that a manufacturer is trustworthy is an assurance that he is so reputed, \u2014 that nothing to the contrary is known; and, while an action may lie upon such a promise in case of fraud, it is not a statement which gives a right of action against the publisher if the party recommended does not do as he agrees under any particular contract. The defendant assured the readers of its publications that its advertisements were honest and trustworthy. It did not guarantee the faithful performance of contracts made by its advertisers nor agree to answer for their debt or default; nor did it promise that in supplying materials for the construction of the house the North American Construction Company would fully and exactly carry out the terms of agreement with the plaintiff\u2019s intestate. See <em>Eaton </em>v. <em>Mayo, </em>118 Mass. 141.</p>\n<p id=\"AsB\">We find nothing in the evidence to show a breach of the defendant\u2019s promise. On the contrary, the defendant, according to its practice, before receiving the advertisement, made a thorough investigation .of the North American Construction Company, \u201cthe personnel of the company, their standing, . . . their business and financial ability and their general reputation;\u201d and the result was entirely satisfactory. There is nothing to show that this investigation was not careful and complete, or that it revealed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>or ought to have revealed any thing not in harmony with the statements of its editorial.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">There is nothing in the answer of the defendant\u2019s president that shows a failure to examine thoroughly the affairs of the construction company. It appears from his answers that the North American Construction Company advertised in the \u201cSaturday Evening Post\u201d during the years 1910,1911 and 1913, and that the defendant had no knowledge that this company was unreliable or ever had failed to fulfil its contracts. Two or three complaints about the construction company had been made to the defendant, but, with one exception, it did not appear what the reasons were, if any, for these complaints, or on what basis they were settled, if settlements were made. In one case the complaint was from a purchaser of a house, who said the siding and flooring were imperfect. He wrote to the North American Construction Company about it several times but no adjustment was made; he then wrote to the defendant, and although he did not make the .purchase because of an advertisement \u201cseen especially in the paper of the defendant,\u201d but after a visit to the construction company\u2019s factory, the construction company settled the loss and the matter was ended. These complaints did not show that the construction company was dishonest, unreliable, or lacking in integrity, and they are far from showing any neglect on the part of the defendant to investigate properly the North American Construction Company and the standing and reputation of its officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">There is no evidence that the representations made by the defendant were false. It follows that the verdict was directed properly and judgment is to be entered for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
