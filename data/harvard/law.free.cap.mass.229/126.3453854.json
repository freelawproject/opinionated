Writ in the Municipal Court of the City of Boston dated January 25. 1915.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A-j\">At the trial in the Municipal Court the plaintiff introduced evidence which tended to show that the plaintiff, being the owner of a pair of diamond earrings, allowed one Wyner, who was a partner in the theatre business of one Levitan and who sometimes sold goods for the plaintiff, to take them into his possession to sell them to Levitan, but that the title to them and the entire beneficial interest in them remained in the plaintiff; that afterwards, in September, 1914, Wyner, Levitan and the defendant were in the lobby of a theatre in Boston, and that Wyner handed the earrings to the defendant, enclosed in a box, and that the defendant took them into his hands to inspect and examine and appraise them; that at that time the lobby was crowded with people, about two hundred in number; that the defendant, having received the earrings into his hands, carried the earrings a short distance across the lobby to a place near a light for the purpose of examining them, and that the defendant dropped one of the earrings and it was lost, and that the plaintiff has not since received it; that afterwards the defendant went to the plaintiff\u2019s store and talked with the plaintiff, that the plaintiff then demanded the earrings, and that .the defendant then told the plaintiff that, if he would refrain for a short time from bringing an action against the defendant for the loss of the earrings, he, the defendant, would pay the plaintiff $85; that the plaintiff did so refrain for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>such time, but that the defendant did not pay that sum to the plaintiff and did not return either or both of the earrings to the plaintiff or to Wyner.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b154-5\">The defendant testified that, while he was standing in the lobby, Wyner and one Levitan came to the defendant and asked him to appraise the earrings, Wyner saying to Levitan, \u201cHere is Mr. Huhn, he will tell you what they cost;\u201d that the defendant took the earrings from either Levitan or Wyner and, as he opened the box, one of the earrings dropped on the floor and was not recovered although the loss was reported to the police; that the defendant\u2019s promise to the plaintiff at the plaintiff\u2019s store to pay for the earrings was made by him on behalf of Levitan who had sent him to adjust the loss and that he returned the one earring to Levitan from whom he had received it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b154-6\">The judge found the facts to be those put in evidence by the plaintiff. He found that the defendant, in handling and dealing with the earrings did not exercise such care as a reasonably prudent man would have exercised under the circumstances, but handled and dealt with them in a careless and negligent manner. He found that, before the bringing of the action, the plaintiff demanded the earrings of the defendant and that the defendant did not return either or both of them to the plaintiff or to Wyner.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b154-7\">At the close of the evidence the defendant asked the judge to rule \u201cthat upon all the evidence judgment must be directed for the defendant.\u201d The judge refused so to rule and \u201cfound for the plaintiff in tort for $85,\u201d which he found to be the value of the two earrings. At the request of the defendant the judge reported the case to the Appellate Division.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b154-8\">The Appellate Division made the order, \u201cReport dismissed,\u201d and the defendant appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b154-9\"><em>W. Hartstone, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b154-10\"><em>S. Sigilman, </em>for the plaintiff, submitted a brief.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b154-11\">Pierce, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A_L\">The defendant assumed at most the obligation of a gratuitous bailee when, in the lobby of a theatre crowded with people, he received from one Wyner a pair of diamond earrings in a box and at the request of Wyner then and there undertook to inspect, examine and appraise them without reward. <em>Foster </em>v. <em>Essex Bank, </em>17 Mass. 479. The duty which the law imposes on gratuitous bailees is that the bailee shall act in good faith, that is, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>shall use the degree of care in the performance of the undertalcing which is measured by the carefulness which the depository uses toward his own property of similar land under like circumstances. <em>Foster </em>v. <em>Essex Bank, ubi supra. Whitney </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>8 Met. 91. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>First National Bank in Westfield, </em>99 Mass. 605.</p>\n<p id=\"AVh\">In an action of contract or of tort for breach of duty imposed by law, the mere fact \u201cthat the defendant dropped one of the earrings and it was lost,\u201d is not sufficient evidence of his gross negligence to warrant a finding for the plaintiff. The finding of the judge \u201cthat the defendant, in handling and dealing with the earrings did not exercise such care as a reasonably prudent man would have exercised under the circumstances,\u201d imposed upon the defendant, a gratuitous bailee, a standard of care which measures the duty of a bailee for hire. This was manifest error.</p>\n<p id=\"AqT\">Upon the reported facts the failure to return the lost earring is not a conversion. \u201cThe action of trover is not maintained by proof of negligence, but only of misfeasance amounting to a conversion.\u201d Foster, J., in <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Worcester Railroad, </em>14 Allen, 439, 443.</p>\n<p id=\"A69\">As regards the other earring, the facts found warrant a finding that the defendant, in the possession of the earring, on demand refused to deliver it to the owner, the plaintiff. Moreover, the testimony of the defendant would warrant a finding that he delivered the earring to a person unauthorized to receive it by the owner or by the person from whom the defendant received it. An action of trover will lie upon either view of the facts. <em>Devereux </em>v. <em>Barclay, </em>2 B. &amp; Aid. 702. <em>Claflin </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Lowell Railroad, </em>7 Allen, 341. <em>Saxon Mills </em>v. <em>New York, New Haven, &amp; Hartford Railroad, </em>214 Mass. 383, 391, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"AGs\">At the close of the evidence the defendant asked the judge to rule \"that upon all the evidence judgment must be directed for the defendant.\u201d In effect, this was a request to rule that the evidence was insufficient in any legal form of declaring to justify a finding for the plaintiff for any amount. <em>Ideal Leather Goods Co. </em>v. <em>Eastern Steamship Corp. </em>220 Mass. 133. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Pelonsky, </em>210 Mass. 502, 506. The request was refused rightly.</p>\n<p id=\"ADD3\">However, it is manifest that judgment should not be entered for $85, the value of both earrings, but should be in such amount as upon hearing shall be determined was the value of the single <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>earring at the time it was converted. <em>Loanes </em>v. <em>Gast, </em>216 Mass. 197, 199.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">It follows that the order of the Appellate Division of the Municipal Court of the City of Boston, \u201cReport dismissed,\u201d must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
