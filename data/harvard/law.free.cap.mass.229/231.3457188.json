L. c. 150, \u00a7 20, the guardian is given a right also to include in such an account an item showing a payment to the ward of a balance which by the decree modifying the former account was found still to be due to the ward from him.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b257-13\">Appeal, by the former guardian of Josephine Faxon from a decree of the Probate Court for the county of Middlesex allowing a motion of the ward that a ninth guardian\u2019s account be dismissed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b257-14\">The first to the eighth accounts of the guardian previously were before this court upon appeals and decisions were rendered which are reported in 224 Mass. 145 and 226 Mass. 218. The eighth account was entitled \u201cGuardian\u2019s Eighth and Final Account\u201d and purported to cover a period ending with August 4, 1914. After the rescript issued in accordance with the decision in 226 Mass. 218, a decree entitled a \u201cFinal Decree\u201d was entered on March 22, 1917, by order of a single justice of this court and by assent of the parties, which, so far as material, was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b258-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>\u201cThe total amount with interest computed to March 20, 1917, with which the guardian is charged . . . being $10,235.82, as balance in Schedule C of the Eighth and Final Account of said Guardian due said Josephine Faxon, and it is further ordered, adjudged and decreed that the appellant, Josephine Faxon, forthwith assign and deliver to the said guardian, Charles S. Ensign, Jr., the promissory note for $5,000 and the mortgage securing said note given by Elizabeth Doherty and Edward J. Doherty to said Josephine Faxon . . . and as modified the various decrees of the Probate Court are affirmed, and the cause is remanded to the Probate Court for further proceedings.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b258-3\">Thereafter the former guardian filed in the Probate Court the ninth account, which now is in question. It charged the accountant, in schedule A, with the sum of $8,974.83, which previously had been decreed to be due on the eighth account, and with various amounts of interest on balances previously decreed to be due because of modifications of the fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth accounts. In schedule B were credits to the accountant for expenses of witnesses, stenographers, a constable, printing of record and of briefs and services of an attorney and of the guardian, alleged to have been incurred in the hearings upon the first eight accounts; and also two items of payments made on February 10,1916,andMarchl5,1917,for \u201cpremium on guardian\u2019s bond,\u201d and the sum of $7,428.06 alleged to have been paid to the ward.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b258-4\">The ward moved in the Probate Court to \u201cdismiss the ninth account.\u201d The motion was heard by <em>Chamberlain, </em>J., who made the following decree: \u201cThe within motion is allowed. The guardian having rendered a final account passed upon by the court, there is no warrant in law, as the case now stands, for a further accounting. The \u2018ninth account\u2019 is accordingly disallowed.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b258-5\">The former guardian appealed. The appeal was heard by <em>Loring, </em>J., by whose order a decree was made, which recited that it appeared that the Doherty mortgage and mortgage note had been delivered to the former guardian in accordance with the decree entered by order of the single justice on March 22, 1917, and \u201cordered, adjudged and decreed that the decree of the Probate Court in the matter of the ninth account, be, and the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>hereby is, affirmed and said cause is remanded to said Probate Court for further proceedings.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b259-5\">The former guardian appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b259-6\"><em>G.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"ARG\">This is an appeal from a decree disallowing the ninth account of the petitioner as guardian of the respondent. The reason for this decree was stated in it to be that since the guardian has \"rendered a final account passed upon by the court, there is no warrant in law, as the case now stands, for a further accounting.\u201d The account so passed upon by the court was entititled \u201c Guardian\u2019s Eighth and Final Account.\u201d Questions respecting it came to this court in 224 Mass. 145, and in 226 Mass. 218.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-9\">The decree was final as to all matters within its sweep. The account to which it related, according to its statement of period covered, ended with August 4, 1914. The final decree on it was entered in this court on March 22, 1917. It contains no recital that it comprehends all matters relating to the estate of the ward after the date when the account was filed. It does include in the balance due from the guardian interest computed to March 20, 1917. It would have been within the power of the single justice to have made an adjudication as to the disbursements and charge of the guardian in connecting with that account up to and including the termination of proceedings respecting it. A decree may be made in this particular final, provided it appears by its express terms that that matter has been considered and disposed of. Thus an end may be put to litigation touching it. That is the practice in equity. <em>Bauer </em>v. <em>International Waste Co. </em>201 Mass. 197. <em>Day </em>v. <em>Mills, </em>213 Mass. 585. <em>Collins </em>v. <em>Snow, </em>218 Mass. 542, 545. <em>Hanscom, </em>v. <em>Malden &amp; Melrose Gas Light Co. </em>220 Mass. 1, 9. Probate practice in this court follows that of equity so far as practicable and applicable. <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>Chapman, </em>224 Mass. 427, 428. It is in harmony with the decision between these parties in 224 Mass. 145, and with <em>Day </em>v. <em>Nichols, </em>228 Mass. 236, 239. But the decree on the \u201cEighth and Final Account\u201d does not show that this was done. The accountant, therefore, in justice ought to be allowed an opportunity to have his day in court at some time upon the question whether he ought to be allowed for his expenses incurred in connection with that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>litigation. While other parties to that litigation are precluded from seeking their costs and expenses after its conclusion, R. L. c. 162, \u00a7 44, <em>Lucas </em>v. <em>Morse, </em>139 Mass. 59, the guardian not having been required and not having elected to have those matters passed on in the earlier decree, may file a supplemental account in the Probate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">In the account now before us the guardian has charged against the estate disbursement made since the period covered by the eighth account and disconnected with litigation respecting it. He claims to be entitled to premiums paid on his bond as guardian. Such items ordinarily would not be introduced in an account upon appeal, although it is not decided that premiums on bonds may not be included for the purpose of making an account in truth final. This court does not act as a court of first instance in probate appeals. <em>May </em>v. <em>Skinner, </em>152 Mass. 328.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">It is not conclusive against the filing of another account that the next preceding account was described and treated as final and the decree thereon entitled final, provided justice appears to require a further accounting. <em>Baylies </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>1 Pick. 206. <em>Foster </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>134 Mass. 120.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">According to the decree upon the last preceding account there was a balance in excess of $10,000 due from the guardian. It was his duty under the earlier decree to pay that sum to Miss Faxon. He had a right under R. L. c. 150, \u00a7 20, to perpetuate the evidence that he disposed of that balance according to law by presenting an account of his payment to the Probate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">All these circumstances lead to the conclusion that some of the items set forth in the present account were not on their face included within nor disposed of by the former account and the decree thereon. The decree is reversed and the account is to stand for hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-9\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
