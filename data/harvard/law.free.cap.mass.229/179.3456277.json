That subsequently on or about the 1st day of February, A.

He was ready to give it up. He did not refuse to give it up, not definitely. He wanted to show his power before he gave it up. He did not refuse absolutely to give it up. That was laying down there. Nobody had claimed it. The insurance company did not want it.

He testified that it then became his property, and that the defendant was unable to make delivery of the machine. There was also evidence that the defendant said that, \u201con account of certain complications with the insurance company, this burned chassis at Newport he was absolutely unable to make delivery of, this automobile, or to give good title of the same to Mr. Weld.\u201d The defendant denied that he was unable to deliver the automobile. His contention was that it was to be taken by the plaintiff \u201cjust where it laid; that the defendant was under no obligation whatever to do any other thing\u201d and \u201cknew of no reason why Mr. Weld could not go down there and get it.\u201d The jury found for the plaintiff. The defendant moved in writing to have the judge direct a verdict in his favor, and to the denial of this motion by the judge the defendant excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>The declaration is for breach of an executory contract of sale. The trial proceeded on the ground of an actual sale. No question of pleading was raised and the motion of the defendant did not directly call the judge\u2019s attention to this point. In view of the evidence and the conduct of the parties, we treat the case as that of an actual sale. See <em>Lafrance </em>v. <em>Desautels, </em>225 Mass. 324.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">As there was evidence for the jury that the defendant refused to make delivery or to give good title to the property sold, although fully paid therefor, the judge could not grant the defendant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
