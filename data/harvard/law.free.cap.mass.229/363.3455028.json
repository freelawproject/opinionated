Leslie, and was thereafter on the same day voluntarily released from said arrest with the consent and by the order of the attorney for said Maud Hahn, wherefore this defendant says that said execution and judgment have been fully satisfied.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b390-5\">On appeal to the Superior Court the case was tried before <em>Chase, </em>J. It was admitted that the judgment had been recovered as alleged in the plaintiff\u2019s declaration and that the amount thereof with costs and interest was $513.14. The defendant put in evidence a certified copy of the execution in the action of tort, bearing upon it the return of the deputy sheriff which is quoted in the opinion. It was admitted that the execution had not been satisfied except as appeared in the return.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b390-6\">The defendant asked the judge to rule that upon all the evidence as a matter of law the plaintiff was not entitled to recover. The judge refused to make this ruling and found for the plaintiff in the sum of $513.14.

L. c. 168. The officer\u2019s return upon the execution is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-10\">\u201cBy virtue of this execution, and for want of goods, chattels lands or tenements, of the within named judgment debtor to be found by me, within my precinct, sufficient to satisfy the debt of the within named judgment creditor, I this day took the body of the said judgment debtor, Edward Loker, and had him in the court rooms of the Police Court of Newton in said County for a hearing before said court, and while waiting for the court to take up the case, by direction of Bernard F. Murphy, attorney for said judgment creditor, I left the said debtor Edward Loker, with his attorney, Mr. Bigelow, and the sureties for said hearings.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b390-11\">The present action is brought upon the judgment. It was admitted at the trial that the execution had not been satisfied \u201cexcept as appeared in said return.\u201d The defendant contends that he was released by order of the creditor\u2019s attorney after he had been brought before the court, and before any hearing had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>been had, and that such release amounted to a satisfaction of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">One decisive question is whether the judgment creditor would be bound by the action of his attorney in releasing the judgment debtor (if he was so released), in the absence of any evidence to show that such act of the attorney was with the personal knowledge and consent of the judgment creditor.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">It is a general rule that \u201cAn attorney at law has authority, by virtue of his employment as such, to do in behalf of his client all acts, in or out of court, necessary or incidental to the prosecution and management of the suit, and which affect the remedy only, and not the cause of action.\u201d <em>Moulton </em>v. <em>Bowker, 115 </em>Mass. 36, 40. He has power to release an attachment before judgment, and do many other things incidental to the proceedings and necessary or advisable for the interest of his client. <em>Moulton </em>v. <em>Bowker, supra. Shattuck </em>v. <em>Bill, </em>142 Mass. 56, 63, 64.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">Notwithstanding the broad discretionary power vested generally in an attorney, in behalf of his client to do whatever is reasonably necessary to obtain judgment and to collect it afterwards, he cannot, by virtue of his employment, acknowledge satisfaction of a judgment except by payment in full. <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Gamage, </em>1 Pick. 347. <em>Shores </em>v. <em>Caswell, </em>13 Met. 413. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Kendall, 8 </em>Allen, 209. <em>Shattuck </em>v. <em>Bill, </em>142 Mass. 56, 63. Nor has an attorney authority to bind his client by the discharge of a debtor from arrest except on payment in full of the judgment. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Kendall, supra. Simonton </em>v. <em>Barrett, </em>21 Wend. 362. <em>Kellogg </em>v. <em>Gilbert, </em>10 Johns. 220; <em>S. C. </em>6 Am. Dec. 335. <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Presnett, </em>157 N. C. 290, 293. <em>Pomeroy </em>v. <em>Prescott, </em>106 Maine, 401.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">In <em>Anglo-American Land, Mortgage &amp; Agency Co. </em>v. <em>Dyer, </em>181 Mass. 593, at page 598, this court stated, \u201cit is said that the weight of authority in this country seems to be against\u201d the authority of an attorney at law by virtue of his employment to agree to a compromise of a suit out of court without his client\u2019s sanction. <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Gamage, supra. Pomeroy </em>v. <em>Prescott, supra. </em>See also <em>New York, New Haven, &amp; Hartford Railroad </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>158 Mass. 313; <em>Brewer </em>v. <em>Casey, </em>196 Mass. 384; <em>Gilman </em>v. <em>Cary, </em>198 Mass. 318.</p>\n<p id=\"A-jM\">In the case at bar there is nothing to show that the plaintiff authorized or consented to the release of the judgment debtor, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>was present when he was so released, or that the plaintiff after-wards ratified the act of her attorney in this respect. Under these circumstances, the release of the judgment debtor is not a bar to the present action.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">In view of the conclusion reached, it is unnecessary to decide whether the judgment would have been satisfied if the plaintiff had been bound by the act of her attorney. See <em>Crawford-Plummer Co. </em>v. McCarthy, 227 Mass. 350, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
