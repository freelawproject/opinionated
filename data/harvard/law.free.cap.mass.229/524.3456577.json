Russell Countersigned: Address Milton</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-4\">-- Date April 6th 1910\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">On the testimony of Thomas N. James (the plaintiff\u2019s assignor) the judge of the Municipal Court was warranted in finding that Mrs. Russell (the defendants\u2019 testatrix) signed this paper, and that she did so \u201cwith intent to have it operate as a signature on the so called contract.\u201d This disposes of the defendants\u2019 fifth request; and the finding for the plaintiff renders the fourth inapplicable, \u2014 even assuming that it correctly stated an abstract proposition of law. <em>Aradalou </em>v. <em>New York, New Haven, &amp; Hartford Railroad, </em>225 Mass. 235, 240.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">In refusing the defendants\u2019 eleventh request, and giving the twentieth, the judge must have found upon the evidence that James bound himself to do the things named in the printed agreement, in other words, that the contract was a bilateral one. We cannot say that conclusion was not warranted. Presumably he found that James made an offer which Mrs. Russell accepted. <em>Elastic Tip Co. </em>v. <em>Graham, </em>174 Mass. 507. <em>Burroughs Adding Machine Co. </em>v. <em>Mount Auburn Cemetery, </em>217 Mass. 378. The obligation of Mrs. Russell to pay $250 was not dependent on the performance of the obligation assumed by the plaintiff\u2019s assignor, which was to be carried out later. <em>International Textbook Co. </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>221 Mass. 1. <em>Loveland </em>v. <em>Epstein Drug Co. </em>227 Mass. 311. It is unnecessary to consider what construction was placed by the judge on the seventh request; as the defendants asked for it, they cannot complain because it was given.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">The defence raised by the pleadings was that Mrs. Russell did not enter into a contract, not that she was induced to enter into a contract by fraudulent misrepresentations. And it is now recognized by the defendants that the alleged fraudulent misrepresentations of fact contained in the letter to Mrs. Russell and the alleged misleading designation of the proposed work do not constitute a defence in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">The foregoing disposes of all the requests argued by the defendants except those relating to damages. As already said, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>judge was warranted in finding that Mrs. Russell promised to pay the $250 forthwith, and that the payment was not dependent upon the previous performance by James' of his agreement to publish the sketch and portrait of her husband. <em>International Textbook Co. </em>v. <em>Martin, supra. </em>No error appearing on the record, the order of the Appellate Division dismissing the report must be affirmed; and it is</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
