The judge refused to rule at the defendant\u2019s request \u201cThat if the plaintiff is entitled to recover in any amount then that amount cannot exceed the amount agreed upon by and between the plaintiff and the defendant\u2019s daughters.\u201d <em>Held, </em>that the refusal of the judge was right, as the ruling refused assumed the truth of a disputed fact.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b150-10\">Contract on an account annexed for $14 as the price of four mourning hats and two mourning veils furnished to the defendant for the use of his minor daughters.

At the request of the defendant he reported the case to the Appellate Division.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b151-7\">The Appellate Division made an order that the report be dismissed, and the defendant appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b151-8\">The case was submitted on briefs.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b151-9\"><em>B.

His ruling \u201cThat the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>neither expressly nor impliedly authorized the purchase of the goods set forth in the account annexed,\u201d is not inconsistent with a finding that the defendant adopted and ratified the contract by permitting his minor children to retain and use the articles purchased from the plaintiff with his knowledge, as also by his offer to pay the price which his daughters contended was the sum stipulated to be paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">Upon the evidence it cannot be said that hats and veils for the purpose purchased are not within the class of \u201cnecessaries.\u201d Nor could it have been ruled that upon all the evidence and the pleadings the plaintiff was not entitled to recover. The request to rule \"That if the plaintiff is entitled to recover in any amount then that amount cannot exceed the amount agreed upon by and between the plaintiff and the defendant\u2019s daughters,\u201d assumes the proof of a disputed fact, and was refused rightly.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">\n<em>Order dismissing report affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
