The judge made a decree in accordance with the decision of the Industrial Accident Board, in which it was ordered and adjudged \u201cthat the employee is at present totally incapacitated for work because of the injury; that the average weekly wages of the claimant are $7.50; and that there is due her to June 8,1917, a total compensa-tion of eighty-four and fourteen hundredths dollars ($84.14) and a weekly compensation of $5.00 during the continuance of her total incapacity.\u201d The insurer appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b352-7\">The case was submitted on a brief by the insurer.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b352-8\"><em>E.

The only question involved in the appeal is whether there was any evidence to warrant the finding of the board that the average weekly wages of the employee were $7.50.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-11\">The employee, a girl sixteen years old, is found by the Industrial Accident Board to have been \u201ca spare time worker; that is to say she worked in her spare time, after school, three hours five days and all day Saturday of each week, and earned approximately $3 a week.\u201d The board also finds that a person working as a weaver, full time, all day six days a week, would average $7.50 each week. The employee testified that she went to work in the employer\u2019s mill in vacation time of the summer of 1916 and learned to weave. She returned to school in the autumn; but at the end of the session each day she went into the mill and worked as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>spare weaver, averaging about three hours a day. She also worked on Saturdays in the mill. Her weekly pay while working as a spare weaver was from $1.50 to $3.50.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">She was injured on December 7, 1916. It is apparent that the board in determining the amount of the average weekly wages did not act under St. 1915, c. 236.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">There was no evidence to warrant the finding that the average weekly wages of the employee were $7.50. The undisputed evidence shows that she began work during the summer of 1916 and returned to school in the autumn, and that, each day at the end of the school session, she worked as a \u201cspare weaver\u201d or \u201cspare time worker\u201d for approximately three hours, and also worked on Saturdays. On these facts there is no basis for ascertaining \u201caverage weekly wages\u201d as defined in St. 1911, c. 751, Part V, \u00a7 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">It is plain that average weekly wages cannot be determined from earnings \u201cduring the period of twelve calendar months immediately preceding the date of injury, divided by fifty-two.\u201d Nor can the finding that \u201cAll time except these working hours was \u2018lost\u2019 time within the meaning of the statute,\u201d be sustained. The facts in this case are clearly distinguishable from <em>Bartoni\u2019s Case, </em>225 Mass. 349. Nor can average weekly wages be ascertained under that clause of Part V, \u00a7 2, which provides that, \u201cWhere, by reason of the shortness of the time during which the employee has been in the employment of his employer, or the nature or terms of the employment, it is impracticable to compute the average weekly wages, as above defined, regard may be had to the average weekly amount which, during the twelve months previous to the injury, was being earned by a person in the same grade employed at the same work by the same employer; or, if there is no person so employed, by a person in the same grade employed in the same class of employment and in the same district.\u201d There is no evidence to show what average weekly amount, during the twelve months previous to the injury, \u201cwas being earned by a person in the .same grade employed at the same work by the same employer;\u201d and there is no evidence of the average weeldy wages earned by a person \u201cin the same grade employed in the same class of employment and in the same district.\u201d <em>Gorski\u2019s Case, </em>227 Mass. 456, 461. The Industrial Accident Board on review, found that a person working full time as a weaver would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>earn an average weekly wage of $7.50; it also found that the employee was able to earn an average weekly wage of $7.50.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-3\">The finding of the board that the average weekly wages of the employee were $7.50 cannot be sustained, as the amount of compensation to be awarded under Part V, \u00a7 2 is to be determined, not by what the employee is capable of earning, but by what was actually earned. Nor could the compensation to be awarded the employee be determined upon the average weekly wages of a weaver; there was no evidence to show that she was a weaver; it appears that she was a \u201c spare weaver\u201d or \u201cspare time worker,\u201d and there is nothing to indicate what the average weekly wages of such a person, so employed, would amount to. For this reason the case is to be distinguished from <em>Gove\u2019s Case, </em>223 Mass. 187,195.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">If there is such an employment as that of \u201cspare weaver\u201d similar in hours of service, kind of work and requirement of skill to that of the employee during her term of employment, then that may be used as a basis of determining the compensation to be awarded according to the express terms of the statute. Part V, \u00a7 2. If there is no such kind of employment recognized in textile manufacturing, it does not follow that the employee shall go without remuneration, but that the \u201caverage weekly wages\u201d actually earned by her during the time she was actually employed shall be the basis of compensation. \u201cAverage weekly wages\u201d in such a case is not confined to the definition set forth in Part V, \u00a7 2. That definition governs all cases within its terms, but the general scope of the act indicates that the employee is not remediless because he does not come within any clause of that definition, provided he is an employee and is otherwise entitled to recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">\u201cAverage weekly wages\u201d in the definition not being applicable, the words \u201caverage weekly wages\u201d in the sections as to payment (\u00a7\u00a7 9 and 10 of Part II), should be interpreted in their common and ordinary sense and should be computed by dividing the total amount earned by the number of weeks of employment. The testimony and the finding of the board based thereon show such wages to have been $3. This is one of the cases where \u201ca different meaning\u201d of average weekly wages from that given in the definition \u201cis plainly required by the context.\u201d Part V, \u00a7 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">If within thirty days after rescript the employee moves for further hearing, and that motion is allowed the case shall be re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>committed to the Industrial Accident Board. Otherwise, a new decree shall be entered on a basis of $3.00 as average weekly wages, \u2014 the amount shown by the present record as average weekly wages.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
