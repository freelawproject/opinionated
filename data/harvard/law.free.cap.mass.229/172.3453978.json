The defendant alleged a general exception to the admission of the testimony, and in this court contended that the evidence was inadmissible since it related to the value of the premises at the time of the trial and not at the time of the breach of the contract. <em>Held, </em>that the exception must be overruled, because the record did not show that the witness was permitted to testify as to the value of the premises at the time of the trial.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b198-10\">Contract for breach of an agreement in writing and under seal by the defendant to sell to the plaintiff premises at the corner of Hansborough Street and Blue Hill Avenue in that part of Boston which formerly was Dorchester.

The agreement was signed by the plaintiff and by the defendant\u2019s husband, who was alleged to have acted for her with her authority. The defendant excepted to the statement of a witness that at a trial in another case between \u201cparties other than the parties to this suit,\u201d he heard Mrs. Thern testify \u201cthat she gave full authority to Mr. Them to do with the houses as he pleased.\u201d Clearly this evidence was admissible: it was an acknowledgment by the defendant that her husband was authorized to act for her. <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Middlesex, </em>127 Mass. 262. <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Stone, </em>191 Mass. 371, 376.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">The cases of <em>Costigan </em>v. <em>Lunt, </em>127 Mass. 354, and <em>Jaquith </em>v. <em>Morrill, </em>204 Mass. 181, relied on by the defendant, are not in conflict with this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-9\">A real estate expert, who viewed the premises about three weeks before the trial, testified as to their value. It is the contention of the defendant that this evidence was inadmissible, because it was evidence of the value of the premises at the time of the trial, and not evidence of their value at the time when the agreement was broken, \u2014 more than a year before the date of the trial. This exception must be overruled. The record does not show that the witness was permitted to testify as to the value of the premises at the time of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-10\">No other exceptions of the defendant are now argued on her brief, and we consider them waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-11\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
