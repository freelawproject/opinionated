Howe, another real estate broker in Worcester. Writ dated January 28, 1916.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b84-7\">The defendant\u2019s answer, as amended, contained in addition to a general denial the following: \u201cAnd the defendant further says that if the plaintiff shall prove that the defendant employed him as his broker as set forth in the declaration, the plaintiff thereafter made a contract with the broker representing the other principal in the exchange of properties thereafter made, by the terms of which the plaintiff agreed to give to such broker a part of the commission which he might receive from the defendant, and that said contract was neither known of nor assented to by the defendant nor by the other principal, and that said contract between the two brokers was against public policy, and that the plaintiff is not entitled to recover.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b84-8\">In the Superior Court the case was tried before <em>Bell, </em>J. The evidence is described in the opinion. The defendant offered in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>evidence two deeds, each bearing stamps of $25, contending that the amount of the stamps placed upon the deeds by the two principals was competent evidence of the value of the property, which was to be determined as the basis of estimating the broker\u2019s commission in case the jury did not find the special contract set out in the declaration. The judge excluded the evidence, subject to the defendant\u2019s exception. At the close of the evidence the defendant asked the judge to make the following rulings:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b85-5\">\u201c 1. The plaintiff having admitted that he made a contract with the broker representing the other principal by which he agreed to give to such broker, in case of an exchange, one half of any commission which he might receive from the defendant, and the plaintiff having admitted that neither principal knew about such contract between the brokers, the plaintiff is not entitled to recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b85-6\"><em>\u201c2. </em>If the plaintiff made a contract with the broker representing the other side by the terms of which he, the plaintiff, was to give one half or a,ny part of his commission to such broker, and if such contract between the two brokers was not known and assented to by the principals, the plaintiff cannot recover.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b85-7\">The judge refused to make either of these rulings and gave to the jury in substance the following instructions, which were requested by the plaintiff:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b85-8\">\u201cThe fact that the plaintiff had an arrangement with Miss Howe to divide his commission with her does not affect his rights in this case. If the jury finds that the negotiating of the exchange and the consummation of the agreement for exchange were accomplished between the principals, the defendant Blake and Mr. Scheffreen, and that the plaintiff merely brought the parties together, the plaintiff is entitled to such commission as was agreed upon between the parties, or, if the jury finds that there was no agreement, to the customary and established commission which applies to property such as the defendant Blake\u2019s was, and this, notwithstanding any agreement between the plaintiff and Miss Howe as to the division of the commission between them.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b85-9\">The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff in the sum of $2,384.78, of which, by order of the judge on a motion for a new trial, the plaintiff remitted $525.50, leaving the verdict to stand in the sum of $1,859.25. The defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b86-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number><em>G. S.

The distinction between a middleman and a broker is clearly defined and has been pointed out by many decisions of this court. A middleman is not subject to the rules governing brokers. He is employed .merely to bring the parties together, when each desires to exchange his property for that of the other, or where one desires to sell and the other to purchase property. In such a transaction, the services are not rendered by one acting as the agent of either party. He merely puts them in a position where they may make their own contracts, and he may later receive a commission from both. <em>Rupp </em>v. <em>Sampson, </em>16 Gray, 398. The distinction between a broker employed as the agent of a person to buy, sell or exchange property, and a middleman is pointed out in <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Osgood, </em>98 Mass. 348.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">In the case at bar, it is plain that the plaintiff acted not as a mere middleman, but as a broker in the transaction, and was the defendant\u2019s agent. The declaration alleges that \u201cthe defendant undertook and agreed to pay to the plaintiff the usual commission for procuring a customer for or for the effecting of such exchange;\u201d the plaintiff testified, \u201c I was the broker representing Mr. Blake;\u201d he introduced evidence to show the usual broker\u2019s commission for procuring a customer for such property. The judge, in his charge to the jury, treated the action as one brought to recover a broker\u2019s commission, and the bill of exceptions recites that it is an action brought for that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-9\">It is manifest that the case was treated by the parties and by the presiding judge as an action to recover a broker\u2019s commission and not for services rendered as a middleman. No exception was taken by either party to that part of the judge\u2019s charge in which he stated to the jury that it was \u201csimply a case of a broker employed.\u201d He made no reference to the difference between a broker and a middleman. The question cannot now be raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-10\">The undisputed evidence shows that the plaintiff agreed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>give to the broker who acted for Scheffreen one half of his commission, although there was no agreement that the plaintiff should be paid any part of the commission which Scheffreen\u2019s broker was to receive. The agreement between the plaintiff and the broker acting for Scheffreen was not known either by the defendant or by Scheffreen. This secret agreement by which Scheffreen\u2019s broker was to get not only a commission from him but was to receive also one half of the plaintiff\u2019s commission, was a direct fraud upon Scheffreen; this fraud was participated in by the plaintiff. Whether the defendant was harmed or benefited is immaterial: such an agreement is against public policy. And while the agreement in the present case, differs from the one disclosed in <em>Quinn </em>v. <em>Burton, </em>195 Mass. 277, in that the plaintiff in that case was to share in the commissions paid by both parties, still in principle the cases cannot be distinguished.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">The employment of the plaintiff by the defendant was such that he was bound to act with the utmost fidelity and good faith, free from any secret and fraudulent agreement which might subject him, or Scheffreen\u2019s broker, to temptation to act adversely to the interests of his employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">The record shows that Scheffreen\u2019s broker was to receive from him a commission of $500; that broker was to receive also one half of the plaintiff\u2019s commission, which would result in Scheffreen\u2019s broker being paid a sum very largely in excess of $500 out of the commission to be paid by the defendant. The fact that the plaintiff was not to share in the commission which Scheffreen was to pay cannot divest the bargain of its illegal character. It was a fraudulent transaction, contrary to public policy, which would prevent the plaintiff from recovering any commission from the defendant. <em>Thwing </em>v. <em>Clifford, </em>136 Mass. 482. <em>Quinn </em>v. <em>Burton, supra. Sullivan </em>v. <em>Tufts, </em>203 Mass. 155. <em>Maxwell </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Title Ins. Co. </em>206 Mass. 197. The case of <em>Alvord </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>174 Mass. 120, is not an authority in favor of the plaintiff. The decision in that case rests upon the special contract entered into by the parties as pointed out in <em>Quinn </em>v. <em>Burton, supra, </em>and is distinguishable from the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">So far as the case of <em>Chase </em>v. <em>W. G. Veal </em>&amp; <em>Co. </em>83 Texas, 333, cited and much relied on by the plaintiff, is contrary to the conclusion herein reached, we cannot follow it.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>In view of the conclusion reached, we need not determine whether the agreement entered into by the plaintiff with Scheffreen\u2019s broker is in violation of St. 1909, c. 514, \u00a7 28, and thereby made a criminal offence which would preclude the plaintiff from recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">As for the reasons stated the plaintiff cannot recover^ it is unnecessary to decide whether the federal revenue stamps placed on the deeds delivered by the parties were competent evidence of the value of the property conveyed thereby, or were admissible for any other purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">The defendant\u2019s first request for a ruling that the plaintiff is not entitled to recover should have been given. The exceptions must be sustained and judgment should be entered for the defendant in accordance with St. 1909, c. 236.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
