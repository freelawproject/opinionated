Writ in the Municipal Court of the City of Boston dated May 9, 1917.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b326-11\">The evidence at the trial in the Municipal Court is described \u25a0 in the opinion. The defendant asked the judge to rule that upon all the evidence the plaintiff was not entitled to recover. The judge refused to make this ruling and made the following finding: \u201cI find that the plaintiff sustained the injuries complained of through slipping upon ice upon the sidewalk in front of the defendant\u2019s house, which ice was formed by the accumulation of water there coming from a conductor which then and for a period of years previously drained the roof of the adjoining house and was located on or about the dividing line between the houses, and that the ice formed by its discharge was negligently allowed by the defendant to remain on his sidewalk. No part of the defendant\u2019s roof was drained by the conductor.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b326-12\">The judge found for the plaintiff in the sum of $1,500 and at the request of the defendant reported the case to the Appellate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>Division. The Appellate Division made an order vacating the finding and ordering that judgment be entered for the defendant.

There was no evidence tending to show that the defendant controlled the conductor or that any water from his premises drained into it.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">No liability of the defendant can be established by inference or otherwise on this record. There is nothing to indicate responsibility resting on him for the conductor or the water flowing from it. Decisions predicating liability upon such control or ownership like <em>Field </em>v. <em>Gowdy, </em>199 Mass. 568, <em>Marston </em>v. <em>Phipps, </em>209 Mass. 552, <em>Drake </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>203 Mass. 528, <em>Leahan </em>v. <em>Cochran, </em>178 Mass. 566, and <em>Hynes </em>v. <em>Brewer, </em>194 Mass. 435, are inapplicable. The mere circumstance that ice was on the sidewalk in front of his premises did not show negligence on his part.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-9\">There is no evidence of any ordinance requiring him to keep the sidewalk clear of snow and ice. But if there had been such evidence that would not have rendered him liable. <em>Kirby </em>v. <em>Boylston Market Association, </em>14 Gray, 249, 252. <em>Dahlin </em>v. <em>Walsh, </em>192 Mass. 163, 166. See also <em>Menut </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Maine Railroad, </em>207 Mass. 12; <em>Berdos </em>v. <em>Tremont &amp; Suffolk Mills, </em>209 Mass. 489, 493, 494.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-10\">Judgment should be entered for the defendant. St. 1913, c. 716, \u00a7 3. <em>Loanes </em>v. <em>Gast, </em>216 Mass. 197.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-11\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
