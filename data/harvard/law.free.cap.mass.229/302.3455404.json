Lacey and Dr. Frederic J. Cotton, asking for the approval by the Industrial Accident Board of the payment of their fees for services as physicians rendered to Frank Ripley, an injured employee of the Independent Ice Company and a claimant for compensation under the workmen\u2019s compensation act, during the first two weeks after his injury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b328-11\">The decision appealed from was as follows: \u201cThe evidence shows that the only treatment offered the injured employee in the city of Cambridge was that in the notice offering treatment at the Cambridge Relief Hospital. To \u2018furnish\u2019 treatment within the meaning of the act imports, in the opinion of the board, something more than a mere direction to an employee to go to an open hospital or clinic. The act requires that the insurer shall make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>adequate arrangements for the care of those to whom the duty is owed in the event of injury. There is no evidence here that any arrangements were made to furnish treatment, that anything was done more than to direct the employee to go to an open hospital.

Ripley replied that he did not\" want to go to the hospital, that he would like to have his own doctor if he could have him. The foreman told Ripley that he did not know of any reason why he could not have his own doctor, and Dr. Lacey was called who took Ripley home and treated him for his injuries. His bill for services covers the first two weeks after the injury. Dr. Cotton was called in by Dr. Lacey and assisted in treating the employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-10\">The uncontradicted evidence shows that at the time of the injury and previously thereto, notices were posted in different places on the premises where Ripley was employed directing the employees where to go for treatment in case of injury; one of the places so designated by the notices was the Cambridge Relief Hospital on Prospect Street.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>The provision of the statute which requires the association to furnish \u201creasonable medical and hospital services\u201d is contained in St. 1911, c. 751, Part II, \u00a7 5, as amended by St. 1914, c. 708, \u00a7 1. The word \u201cfurnish\u201d as used in the statute was defined by this court in <em>Panasuk\u2019s Case, </em>217 Mass. 589, at page 593, as meaning \u201csomething more than a passive willingness to respond to a demand. It implies some degree of active effort to bring to the injured person the required humanitarian relief.\u201d These words import that some arrangements must be made in advance in the ordinary case, or at least that some one be at hand with authority to make the arrangements for medical relief. If arrangements with a hospital for medical attendance to the employee had been made, the act would have been complied with in that respect. <em>Davidson's Case, 228 </em>Mass. 257. There was evidence that notices had been posted on the premises where the employee was at work to the effect that he could be treated for his injuries at the Cambridge Relief Hospital; this evidence would support a finding by inference that such arrangements had been made. Still there was no direct evidence to that effect, and the board did not make that finding and was not required as matter of law so to find. On the other hand, the board did find that \u201cThere is no evidence here that any arrangements were made to furnish treatment, that anything was done more than to direct the employee to go to an open hospital.\u201d That finding must be accepted. It cannot be said to be unwarranted. Nor can it be said, in view of the findings of fact made by the board, that there was any error of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
