The decision appealed from was as follows: \"The evidence shows and the board find and decide that the employee\u2019s death from tuberculosis, on March 10, 1917, had no causal relation to the personal injury received by him on October 5, 1915; therefore, the claim for compensation is dismissed. The claimant failed to sustain the burden of proving that the condition of tuberculosis was occasioned by or aggravated or accelerated by the injury to his foot; and the weight of the medical evidence leaves it as unlikely and improbable that the injury and the disease had any connection with each other.\u201d The case was heard by <em>Fox, J., </em>who made a decree in accordance with the decision of the Industrial Accident Board, and the alleged dependent widow appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b625-11\"><em>G.

That injury was a fracture of the os calcis and inflammation of the ankle joint. The decisive issue of fact at the hearing was, whether this injury to the employee had a direct causal connection with tuberculosis, of which he died about seventeen months later. The determination of that issue depended upon the weighing of evidence.' It need not be recited. A careful examination of the entire record shows that the decision of the single member of the Industrial Accident Board, and that of the board on appeal, was fully justified on the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
