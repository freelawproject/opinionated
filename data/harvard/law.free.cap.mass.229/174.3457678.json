The plaintiff\u2019s attorney testified that three days after the injury he gave notice to the defendant by mailing a letter to him at his business address in Boston stating the time, place and cause of the accident and claiming damages, and that on the comer of the envelope was printed a request to return the letter, if not delivered, to the address of the writer there stated and that the letter was not returned.

It is stated in the bill of exceptions that \u201cthere was evidence which warranted the jury in bringing in a verdict for the plaintiff, as they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>did, if a due and sufficient notice had been given in accordance with the provisions of St. 1908, c. 305.\u201d The plaintiff contended that she had given such a notice and the defendant denied that he had received such a notice. The evidence upon this subject is described in the opinion. The judge refused to rule as matter of law that the. defendant had received no notice in compliance with the statute. He submitted the question to the jury, who returned a verdict for the plaintiff in the sum of $449.75. The defendant alleged exceptions, it being stipulated by the parties that, if the judge was wrong in submitting the case to the jury, judgment was to be entered for the defendant; otherwise, judgment was to be entered on the verdict.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b201-5\">\n<em>G.

The question in the case is whether due and sufficient notice was given in accordance with St. 1908, c. 305. The plaintiff\u2019s attorney testified that on February 11, 1911, he gave notice to the defendant by mailing a letter, postage prepaid, to him at No. 53 State Street, Boston, Mass., stating the time, place and cause of the accident and claiming damages. On the envelope was a notice \u201c return to Room 306, Kimball Building, Boston, Mass.\u201d The letter was deposited in the regular mail chute of the Kimball Building and was not returned to the attorney. The defendant denied that he received this letter and testified that he never received any communication from the plaintiff\u2019s attorney until he received a letter dated October 22, 1912. Under this statute, St. 1908, c. 305, the due service of a proper notice on the person sought to be charged, is a condition precedent to recovery. <em>Baird </em>v. <em>Baptist Society, </em>208 Mass. 29. <em>Sweet </em>v. <em>Pecker, </em>223 Mass. 286. Notice is to be given to the person obliged by law to keep the building in repair and \u201cLeaving the notice with the occupant of said premises, or, in case there is no occupant, posting the same in a conspicuous place thereon, shall be a sufficient compliance with the foregoing provisions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">In <em>Blanchard </em>v. <em>Ely, </em>179 Mass. 586, which was a petition to enforce a lien under Pub. Sts. c. 192, \u00a7 24, requiring a demand for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>payment to be \u201cdelivered to the debtor or left at his usual place of abode,\u201d it was held that demand in proper form, sent by mail, was a compliance with the statute. In that case the notice was received by the defendant at his residence, on the day after it was mailed, but the question decided was that a demand sent by mail was properly served. That case governs the case at bar and a notice sent by mail under St. 1908, c. 305, to the person obliged by law to keep the premises in repair was properly given. There was evidence that a notice in proper form was sent by mail to the defendant and was never returned. This was some evidence that the notice was sent and received. The depositing in the mail chute in the Kimball Building of a letter properly addressed, with the postage prepaid, is <em>prima facie </em>evidence that the defendant received it. It is a presumption of fact founded on the probability that the officers of the government will do their duty. <em>Swampscott Machine Co. </em>v. <em>Rice, </em>159 Mass. 404. <em>Johnson v. Brown, </em>154 Mass. 105, 106. <em>Huntley </em>v. <em>Whittier, </em>105 Mass. 391. <em>Briggs </em>v. <em>Hervey, </em>130 Mass. 186. As there was evidence that the notice was sent and received, the judge could not say as matter of law that it did not reach the defendant. Notwithstanding his testimony that he did not receive it, it was a question of fact for the jury. <em>Shea </em>v. <em>New York, New Haven, &amp; Hartford Railroad, </em>173 Mass. 177, 179. <em>Elliott </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>194 Mass. 518.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">The language of the statute which permits the leaving of the notice with the occupant of the premises, or if there is no occupant, posting the same in a conspicuous place thereon, provides a convenient way for the giving of the notice where the landlord is unknown or if for any other reason it is difficult to deliver the notice. This language does not imply that a proper notice sent by mail to the defendant is ineffectual. <em>Blanchard </em>v. <em>Ely, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
