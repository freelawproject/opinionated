The second count was upon a <em>quantum meruit </em>for $2,500 for services rendered to the defendants \"in connection with leasing and subleasing the estate known as 33, 35 and 37 Tremont Street, Boston, during the years 1911, 1912, 1913 and 1914.\u201d Writ dated July 31, 1914.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b195-5\">In the Superior Court the action was tried before <em>Chase, </em>J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b195-6\">One contention of the defendants was that, if they were indebted to the plaintiff, they were indebted to him jointly with one William V. Fischel, who was living and should have been joined as a plaintiff in the action. The evidence on this issue was conflicting. At the close of the evidence the defendants moved that a verdict be ordered for them. The motion was denied, and a special question was submitted to the jury, \u201cWere the plaintiff and Fischel partners?\u201d The jury answered the question in the negative.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b195-7\">The defendants received a sublease of the premises in question from Braus at a yearly rental of $18,500, they paying the taxes.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b195-8\">Other evidence on the other issues involved is described in the opinion, where also are set out other contentions and requests of the defendants for rulings.

The declaration is in two counts, the first on the account annexed and the second upon a <em>quantum meruit. </em>There was a verdict for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-13\">The defendants asked the trial judge to rule (1) \u201cUpon all the evidence the plaintiff is not entitled to recover,\u201d (2) \u201cThe plaintiff is not entitled to recover upon any count of this declaration,\u201d and (3) \u201cThe plaintiff is not entitled to recover upon the <em>quantum, meruit </em>count of his declaration.\u201d These requests for rulings were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>refused and the defendants excepted. In answer to a specific question the jury found that the plaintiff was not a partner of Fischel; and to the question \u201cWas the payment of a commission to\" the plaintiff upon the Braus lease dependent upon a condition which had not been performed prior to July 31, 1914, [the date of the writ] ? \u201d they answered in the negative, and found for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">Braus was the lessee of the premises 33, 35, 37 Tremont Street, Boston. The largest item in the account was for a commission in obtaining this lease for the defendants. The defendants contend that Fischel was a partner of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">To prevent the plaintiff\u2019s recovery because of the alleged partnership with Fischel, it was not enough to show that they held themselves out as partners and could be considered such by their creditors. It was necessary to show that they were partners between themselves and not merely partners as to third persons; that Fischel was in fact a partner of the plaintiff and entitled with him to bring the action. As stated by Chief Justice Shaw in <em>Bishop </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>9 Gray, 430, 432, \u201cIt is not enough that parties held themselves out or suffered themselves to be held out as partners; this might be sufficient to charge them as defendants, either in contract, or for negligence or want of skill; but the same proof, when partnership was set up to prevent one from recovering, would wholly fail of establishing it.\u201d Whether they were in fact partners depended upon the agreement of the parties. <em>McMurtrie </em>v. <em>Guiler, </em>183 Mass. 451. And as the evidence was conflicting, this question was properly submitted to the jury. <em>Adamson </em>v. <em>Guild, </em>177 Mass. 331.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">There was some evidence that the plaintiff, acting as a real estate broker, contracted with the defendants to procure for them the Braus lease for a commission of $1,116.72, and two other leases to other tenants, one for a commission of $839.38 and one for a commission of $160; that these leases were obtained; that the plaintiff performed his part of the contract, and the defendants refused to pay him. Upon establishing these facts the plaintiff could recover on the account annexed. <em>Lovell </em>v. <em>Earle, </em>127 Mass. 546. There also was evidence tending to show that the plaintiff agreed to secure the Braus lease for the defendants, but was not to receive the agreed commission of $1,116.72 until <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>the premises were rented for \u201cas much or more than you pay Braus,\u201d and that the plaintiff was to assist by securing a sublease for the defendants without compensation. It was the contention of the plaintiff that he fully performed his agreement and that the defendants refused and neglected to co-operate with him; that \u201cif he [the plaintiff] had been let alone in the management of the estate and had had a little co-operation from the defendants,\u201d the premises could have been rented for $25,000 a year. There was other evidence tending to show that the defendants, by their lack of diligence and failure to aid the plaintiff, prevented the estate from returning the amount stated. Upon these facts the plaintiff had the right to go to the jury on the <em>quantum meruit </em>count and recover the value of his services. See <em>Gillis </em>v. <em>Cobe, </em>177 Mass. 584; <em>Hayward </em>v. <em>Leonard, </em>7 Pick. 181.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">There was no error in refusing to order the plaintiff to elect upon which count he would proceed. The counts were not inconsistent and with the conflicting evidence on each count, it could not be known which view of the case the jury would accept. <em>Young </em>v. <em>Hayes, </em>212 Mass. 525, 532.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">The defendants were desirous of controlling the leased premises and securing the Braus lease for purposes connected with their business. After the defendants had accepted the offer of Braus, the plaintiff, on inspecting the lease, found that Braus was paying a yearly rental of $14,000 and taxes. There is no evidence that this fact was made known to the defendants. While a broker must act in perfect good faith and disclose to his employer every material fact known to him, it does not appear that the rent paid by Braus was a fact of material importance to the defendants; and even if it were such, the defendants did not call the court\u2019s attention to this question. They asked for no ruling relating to this aspect of the case and did not' except to the rulings given. This contention, therefore, is not now open to the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">We find no error of law in the conduct of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
