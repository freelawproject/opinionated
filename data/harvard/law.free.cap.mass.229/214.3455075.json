St. 1914, c. 553, took effect on May 21, 1914.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b240-11\">In the Superior Court the case was tried before <em>Wait, </em>J. There was evidence warranting a finding that the defendant was negligent. The evidence in regard to the exercise of due care by the plaintiff is described in the opinion. At the close of the evidence the defendant asked the judge to order a verdict for him. This the judge refused to do and submitted the case to the jury, who returned a verdict for the plaintiff in the sum of $3,119.

The only question raised by the bill of exceptions is the due care of the plaintiff. The accident occurred August 23,1914. The jury found for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">The defendant\u2019s contention was that, while he was proceeding outbound through Harvard Square and moving at about eight miles an hour, the plaintiff ran out from the sidewalk on the defendant\u2019s right and crossed the square without looking; that after he had passed beyond and in front of the defendant\u2019s car, he suddenly turned and stepped into the forward left hand side of the car. There was also evidence that the plaintiff went across the square \u201con a dog trot,\u201d continuing in the same direction, \u201cthat the automobile changed direction and ran the plaintiff down; that it seemed to chase him.\u201d The plaintiff testified that he looked up and down when about to cross, and heard no automobile horn, and did not change his course from the time he left the curbstone. On this evidence, the plaintiff\u2019s care was clearly a question for the jury. <em>Creedon </em>v. <em>Galvin, </em>226 Mass. 140.
