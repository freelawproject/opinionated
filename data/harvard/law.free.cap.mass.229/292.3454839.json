Upon a suit in equity brought by the maker of the first offer against the trustee to enforce the specific performance of the agreement with him, it was <em>held </em>that the bill must be dismissed, because the condition of the agreement upon which alone the obligation to convey was to become operative never had occurred.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b319-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>In the same suit it was <em>said </em>that the defendant trustee had committed no breach of contract and that in informing the Probate Court of the higher offer he had performed his plain duty as trustee.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b319-5\">In the case above described it also was <em>pointed out </em>that the fact that the trustee had authority under the will to make the sale without a license did not affect the validity of the requirement in the contract of the procuring of a license from the Probate Court as a condition precedent to a sale.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b319-6\">Bill in equity, filed in the Superior Court on July 30, 1917, against the surviving trustee under the will of Silas Pierce, late of Boston, to enforce the specific performance of an alleged contract to sell and convey to the plaintiff two lots of land -with the buildings thereon numbered 47 and 49 on Hammond Street in Boston.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b319-7\">The material allegations of the bill are described in the opinion. The defendant demurred to the bill. The case was heard upon the demurrer by <em>Fox, </em>J., who made an order sustaining the demurrer. Later by order of the judge a final decree was entered ordering that the bill be dismissed. The plaintiff appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b319-8\"><em>E. Greenhood, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b319-9\"><em>F. O. White, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b319-10\">By the Court.</author>\n<p id=\"AVI\">The bill alleges that the defendant as trustee, having authority under the will to sell real estate, made an agreement with the plaintiff to sell certain real estate \u201c subject to the approval of the Probate Court for Suffolk County and if license to sell cannot be obtained, the deposit shall be returned and the agreement cancelled; \u201d that a petition for such license was filed, a citation was issued and on the return day no one appeared to oppose the granting of such license, but that the defendant appeared and \u201crepresented to the court that, since filing said petition, he had received\u201d a more advantageous offer than that set forth in the petition, whereupon the court suggested an amendment substituting the higher offer, and this was done; and that \u201cthe defendant, by his own said conduct, prevented himself from obtaining a license to sell said estate according to the terms of said agreement with the plaintiff.\u201d The prayer is for specific performance and for a decree directing the defendant to procure a license unless opposition is made thereto, to require him to make good to the trust personally the difference between the agreed price and the subsequent offer, and for other relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-11\">It is manifest that the condition of the agreement, upon which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>alone the obligation to convey should become operative, has never been performed. The court never granted such a license. It was the plain duty of the defendant in the execution of his trust to report to the Probate Court the fact that he \u201chad received\u201d a higher offer for the real estate than the price named in the agreement. He was in no way responsible for the action of the court. The record is at the opposite pole from showing any actual or constructive bad faith on the part of the trustee. The circumstance that the defendant had authority under the will to make the sale without a license does not affect the validity of the condition in the agreement as to procuring a license.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-3\">\n<em>Decree dismissing bill affirmed with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
