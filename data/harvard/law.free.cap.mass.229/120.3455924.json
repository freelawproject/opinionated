But each return was accompanied by a protest in writing that they were not required to make a return or to pay an income tax. The respondent nevertheless levied the assessments, the amount of which if the income is taxable is not in dispute, and, an application for abatement having been denied, the taxes were paid under protest, and the petitioners appealed as provided in St. 1916, c. 269, \u00a7 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-12\">The testator having been domiciled in this Commonwealth, the validity of the tax depends upon the construction to be given to St. 1916, c. 269, \u00a7 8, the material portion of which reads, \u201cThe income received by persons since deceased shall be taxed to their estates.\u201d By \u00a7 1, a tax \"upon incomes\u201d is to be levied \u201cin the year nineteen hundred and seventeen, and in each year thereafter.\u201d The tax year therefore began to run from January 1, 1917, and the words \u201csince deceased\u201d refer only to the estates of those who died after the commencement of its operation. <em>J.
