The crossing tender testified that as soon as the horse fell he started from his shanty near the crossing and ran up the track on which the train was approaching with a red flag to stop the train, that he travelled from the shanty up the track about three hundred and thirty feet and that he saw the train when he was about half way to where he stopped, that the train was then about two hundred and fifty feet beyond a certain tower which was over eight hundred feet from the crossing. There was evidence that there were two or three freight cars on a side track about two hundred and fifty feet from the crossing and also that there was a curve in the track between the crossing and the approaching train, and that both of these things somewhat obstructed the engineer\u2019s view of the crossing. <em>Held, </em>that upon all the evidence it was a question for the jury whether the engineer saw the crossing tender or in the exercise of reasonable care ought to have seen him and have stopped his train in time to avoid the collision.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b559-3\">In the same case there also was evidence that the train consisted of five or six cars, each from forty to sixty feet long, that when it struck the plaintiff\u2019s wagon it was running at the rate of fifteen or twenty miles an hour and that it was not brought to a stop until all but the last car had passed over the crossing. It appeared that the crossing was \u201ca few hundred feet\u201d from a passenger station at which the train was to stop. <em>Held, </em>that this court could not say that there was not evidence from which the jury might have found that the train was running faster than was reasonable under the circumstances.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b559-4\">In the \"same case it was <em>held </em>that evidence as to the height of the gates at the crossing and whether the engineer could have seen that they were raised was admissible in connection with other evidence upon the question, whether he was running the train at an unreasonable rate of speed as he approached the crossing.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b559-5\">In the same case it was <em>held </em>that evidence as to the speed of the train was competent for the same purpose.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b559-6\">Two actions OF tort, the first by the owner of a wagon and the second by the owner of a pair of horses, for damage to the wagon and the horses from being run into by an engine and train of the defendant at a grade crossing of the tracks of the railroad operated by the defendant with Worcester Street in Framingham on February 17, 1915.

If you find that the engineer did not see the crossing until he had passed the end of the last freight car, that fact is nevertheless no evidence of negligence of the defendant, or its agents or servants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b560-6\">\u201c10. If you find that the gates were up and that they could have been seen from an approaching engine when five or six hundred feet away by one who had looked, and if you find that the engineer did not look, it is no evidence of negligence on the part of the defendant, or the engineer, that he did not look or did not see.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b560-7\">\"11.

The jury returned verdicts for both plaintiffs, and assessed damages in the case of the plaintiff Clapp in the sum of $75 and in the case of the plaintiff Brennan in the sum of $290. The defendant alleged exceptions to the refusal of the judge to make the rulings requested, to certain portions of the charge and to certain rulings as to the admission of evidence.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b561-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number><em>A.

The edge of the plank was worn down, sloughed off.\u201d The plaintiff Brennan, in describing the condition of the planking where the horse fell, said: \u201cWell, there was a piece of plank ... was wore down. It is some slippery like there. When the horse got her foot in there . . . and . . . her foot slipped in there between the rail and the plank, and there she caught, . . . held it in there by the toe piece.\u201d There was evidence from other witnesses that the plank was worn and rounded at the side nearest the rail. There was also evidence that the plank was so worn along the side nearest the rail for two or three feet.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">The defendant was required by statute to keep in repair that portion of Worcester Street that was crossed by its railroad so that travellers would be secured a safe and easy passage across it. St. 1906, c. 463, Part II, \u00a7 112. <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Maine Railroad, </em>211 Mass. 573.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">The presiding judge, at the request of the defendant, instructed the jury that \u201cIt is not negligent for the defendant to maintain on a crossing a distance of two and a half inches between the plank and the rail. It is not negligence on the part of the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>ant to maintain that space of two and a half inches between the edge of the plank and the rail.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b562-3\">The evidence that the edge of the planking where the horse fell was worn and sloped down on the outer edge and was slippery, warranted a finding that it was in a defective and unsafe condition which rendered the highway.unsafe for travellers, and that such defective condition could have been discovered and remedied by the defendant in the exercise of reasonable care and diligence. <em>Gillett </em>v. <em>Western Railroad, </em>8 Allen, 560. <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Maine Railroad, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">Upon the question whether the engineer was running his engine at an excessive and unreasonable rate of speed, the crossing tender testified that as soon as the horse fell upon the track, he (the crossing tender) started from his shanty on the east side of the tracks and south of the crossing and ran up the south bound track, on which the train was approaching, with a red flag to stop the train; that the distance he travelled from the shanty up the track he estimated at about three hundred and thirty feet, and that he first saw the train when he was about half way to where he stopped, that \u201cthe train was- then about where Chenery\u2019s coal shed is located, which he estimated to be about two hundred and fifty feet beyond the tower,\u201d which was over eight hundred feet north of the crossing. This witness also testified that he first saw the roof of the engine cab when the engine was about at the freight house. The record shows that the freight house was about six hundred feet north of the crossing. While there were two or three freight cars on the side track about two hundred and fifty feet north of the crossing, and a curve in the track, both of which somewhat obstructed the engineer\u2019s view of the crossing, still it was a question for the jury upon all the evidence whether the engineer saw the crossing tender or in the exercise of reasonable care ought to have seen him and have stopped his train in time to have avoided the collision. <em>Hicks </em>v. <em>New York, New Haven, &amp; Hartford Railroad, </em>164 Mass. 424.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">There was evidence that the train, consisting of five or six cars, each from forty to sixty feet long, was running at the rate of fifteen or twenty miles an hour when it struck the team, and was not brought to a stop until all but the last car had passed over the crossing. In view of the location of the crossing (which is de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>scribed as \u201ca few hundred feet\u201d from the passenger station at Framingham Centre), the speed of the train, the distance it went beyond the crossing before it stopped, and the testimony of the crossing tender, we cannot say that there was not evidence from which the jury might have found that the train was running faster than was reasonable under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\">The question whether the driver of the team was in the exercise of due care was for the jury, and the defendant does not contend to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">The evidence as to the height of the gates and whether the engineer could have seen them was admissible in connection with \u25a0the other evidence upon the question whether he was running the train at an unreasonable rate of speed as he approached the crossing; and the evidence as to the speed of the train was competent for the same purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">We perceive no error in the action of the judge in the admission or exclusion of evidence, in the failure to give the rulings requested or in the instructions given.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
