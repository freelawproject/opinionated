The case was tried before <em>Hardy, </em>J. The testimony of the plaintiff is described in the opinion. It is stated in the bill of exceptions that \u201cThere was no evidence as to why the window sash fell.\u201d The defendant\u2019s conductor in charge of the car at the time of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>accident testified that he examined the window after the accident and found the window catches in good condition. The defendant introduced evidence that the car was inspected the day after the accident and that all the window catches were in good order. At the close of all the evidence the judge at the request of the defendant ruled that upon all the evidence the plaintiff was not entitled to recover and ordered a verdict for the defendant.

By order of the Superior Court specifications were filed by the plaintiff alleging that the negligence of the defendant, on which she relied, consisted \u201cin the omission on the part of the defendant to provide a safe and proper window in the car, and as a result of such omission, the window fell down on the arm of the plaintiff and severely injured her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">The plaintiff boarded the car at Sullivan Square in Boston, which is known as a terminal point where all incoming passengers get off; \u201cthe car then goes round the loop and an entirely new set of passengers get on.\u201d All the windows in the car in question were open when the plaintiff boarded it at about a quarter to nine o\u2019clock on the morning of July 14, 1914. She testified that she was the only person in the car near the window during the trip until she was injured, \u2014 about two miles distant from Sullivan Square.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">There was no evidence as to what caused the window to fall, nor was there evidence to show that it was in an unsafe or defective condition. From these undisputed facts, it would seem that the plaintiff had failed to sustain the allegation that the defendant had not provided a \u201csafe and proper window in the car.\u201d The unexplained fall of the window in itself was not evidence that it was unsafe or defective, or that the servants or agents of the defendant were negligent. <em>Faulkner </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Maine Railroad, </em>187 Mass. 254. <em>Weinschenk </em>v. <em>New York, New Haven, &amp; Hartford Railroad, </em>190 Mass. 250. <em>Hunt </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>201 Mass. 182.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>If, under the specification of negligence, it is open to the plaintiff to prove that her injuries were due to the negligence of a servant of the defendant in raising the window without properly-fastening it in place, still it is manifest that there is no evidence of such negligence. The contention of the plaintiff that there was evidence to indicate that the window was raised and improperly fastened in place by a servant of the defendant, and not by some person for whose act the defendant would not be responsible, cannot be sustained. The evidence that Sullivan Square is a terminal or junction point where one set of passengers alights and another almost immediately boards the cars, does not show that, in the short interval while the cars are passing round the loop, they are in the exclusive custody and control of the defendant so that the condition of the windows could be found to be due to the defendant\u2019s employees. While all the windows were open when the plaintiff boarded the car, there is nothing to show that they, or any of them, were raised by any employee of the defendant when the car passed round the loop; nor is there any evidence to show that the window in question had not been raised by a passenger, as it is apparent that the car had been in use on that morning previously to its arrival at Sullivan Sq\u00faare.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">The case is governed in principle by <em>Faulkner, </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Maine Railroad, sufra, </em>and cannot be distinguished from it. See also <em>Weinschenk </em>v. <em>New York, New Haven, &amp; Hartford Railroad, supra; Hunt </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, supra. </em>The cases cited and relied on by the plaintiff are clearly distinguishable from the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
