That the facts made by the bill, taken altogether, are not sufficient to take the case out of the ordinary rule that equity will not interfere to restrain trespass where the defendant is solvent, but will leave the parties to their remedy at law.</p><p id=\"b171-9\">2. That the chancellor\u2019s discretion in refusing the injunction without hearing from the defendant by tbe temporary restraining order and rule to show cause, was not abused.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"}}
