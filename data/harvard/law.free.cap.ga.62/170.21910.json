Where the jury have found the prisoner guilty of larceny from the house as charged in the indictment, it is not cause for setting aside the verdict that the court instructed the jury that they might find him guilty of simple larceny if they believed from the evidence that only the latter offense was committed.</p><p id=\"b170-14\">2.
