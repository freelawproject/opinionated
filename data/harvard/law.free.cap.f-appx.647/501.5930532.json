We review de novo the BIA\u2019s conclusion that the Immigration Judge (IJ) properly determined he lacked jurisdiction to consider on remand the Praslas\u2019s amended application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the United Nations Convention Against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT). <em>See Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 903 (5th Cir.2002). Under <em>Bianco v. Holder, </em>624 F.3d 265, 274 (5th Cir.2010), the BIA properly applied <em>Matter of Patel, </em>161. &amp; N. Dec. 600 (BIA 1978), to find that it had specifically limited the scope of the remand to the Praslas\u2019s request for voluntary departure. We will not, as the Pras-las urge, overrule a decision of another panel of this court. <em>See United States v. Fowler, </em>216 F.3d 459, 461 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-23\">Although the Praslas cite the standard of review for denials of motions to reopen, they do not identify any error in the BIA\u2019s analysis denying their motion to reopen and so have waived a challenge on this issue. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App, P. 28(a)(8); <em>Silva-Trevino v. Holder, </em>742 F.3d 197, 199 (5th Cir.2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-24\">Additionally, the Praslas fail to show that the BIA abused its discretion in denying as untimely their motion for reconsideration of its May 2012 decision. <em>See Chambers v. Mukasey, </em>520 F.3d 445, 448 (5th Cir.2008). The Praslas\u2019s arguments ignore the fact that the BIA\u2019s May 2012 decision dismissing their appeal of the denial of asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief was a final decision on those issues. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(d)(7). Because the order was a final decision, the Praslas\u2019s motion for reconsideration, filed more than two years after the BIA mailed the decision, was untimely and the BIA acted within its discretion in denying it. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(2). The Praslas brief no argument regarding the BIA\u2019s denial of the motion for reconsideration of its July 2014 decision and so have waived <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>this issue as well. <em>See Silva-Trevino, </em>742 F.3d at 199.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b525-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir, R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
