In order to ship the items he sold online, he opened a number of UPS, FedEx, and DHL Express accounts in his name or in the name of entities he controlled. Whenever one of those accounts became delinquent, he would set up a new account in the name of another entity he controlled or in the name of an established business with which he was not associated. Scotton also lied to immigration officials about unrelated matters when he applied to become a legal permanent resident.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-16\">As a result of these activities, Scotton was charged with 27 counts of mail fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341, and two counts of making false statements to a government agency, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001(a)(2). He represented himself at trial and, after 29 days, was convicted as charged. The district court sentenced him to 108 months in prison and ordered him to pay $2,582,935.60 in restitution. Scotton appeals his convictions and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-17\">Scotton first challenges the district court\u2019s refusal to strike a juror for cause. He contends that the challenged juror, who said that she was afraid of him at the beginning of the trial, could not have ren<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"949\">*949</page-number>dered an impartial verdict in his case. \u201cThe decision to strike a [ ] juror for cause upon a suggestion of partiality is within the sound discretion of the trial judge.\u201d <em>United States v. Dickerson, </em>248 F.3d 1036, 1045 (11th Cir.2001) (quotation marks omitted). We review that decision only for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Carlin, </em>698 F.2d 1133, 1135 (11th Cir.1983). The trial judge \"must consider whether the juror[] had such fixed opinions that [she] could not judge impartially the guilt of the defendant.\u201d <em>Dickerson, </em>248 F.3d at 1045. We look to the record \u201cto determine whether there is fair support ... for [the] district court\u2019s conclusion that the juror would be impartial.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b973-5\">There is plenty of evidence in the record supporting the conclusion that the challenged juror could render an impartial verdict in Scotton\u2019s case. Before jury deliberations began, the trial judge questioned the juror at length about whether she could weigh the evidence fairly and render an impartial verdict. The juror said that she no longer had concerns for her safety and that she believed she could deliberate and come to a decision fairly. That was enough for the court to conclude that the juror could \u201clay aside any opinion she might hold and render a judgment based solely on the evidence presented in court.\u201d <em>United States v. Rhodes, </em>177 F.3d 963, 965 (11th Cir.1999); <em>see Dickerson, </em>248 F.3d at 1045.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-6\">Scotton next challenges the district court\u2019s - decision to admit into evidence a number of summary charts that compiled the thousands of shipping invoices and waybills associated with his fraudulent accounts. Specifically, Scotton challenges the admission of Government Exhibits 15, 130, 130A, 132B, and 132C. He contends on appeal that the government did not provide him with the records on which those summary charts were based before trial. <em>See United States v. Arias-Izquierdo, </em>449 F.3d 1168, 1184 (11th Cir.2006) (explaining that Fed.R.Evid. 1006 allows \u201cfor the admission of a summary of voluminous business records, but only if certain requirements are met[,]\u201d including that the other parties \u201cbe provided the original records upon which the summary is based \u2014 or duplicates of those originals \u2014 prior to the admission of the summary\u201d). At trial, however, Scotton objected to only Exhibit 130 on that basis.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b973-12\">We review a district court\u2019s decision to admit summary charts into evidence only for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Richardson, </em>233 F.3d 1285, 1293 (11th Cir.2000); <em>Gordon v. United States, </em>438 F.2d 858, 876 (5th Cir.1971) (stating that a district court\u2019s rulings concerning summary charts are subject to reversal \u201conly upon a clear showing of abuse and resulting prejudice to the accused\u201d). But with respect to the exhibits to which Scotton did not object at trial, we review only for plain error. <em>See United States v. Raad, </em>406 F.3d 1322, 1323 (11th Cir.2005) (\u201cPlain error occurs where (1) there is an error; (2) that is plain or obvious; (3) affecting the defendant\u2019s substantial rights in that it was prejudicial and not harmless; and (4) that seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceedings.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b973-13\">The district court specifically found that the challenged exhibits were based on business records that the government had provided to the defense during the course of discovery as required by Federal Rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"950\">*950</page-number>of Evidence 1006. <em>See Arias-Izquierdo, </em>449 F.3d at 1184. Scotton also had the opportunity to cross-examine the government\u2019s witnesses about each of those exhibits and to present his own explanation for their contents, reducing any risk of error. <em>See Richardson, </em>233 F.3d at 1294 (\u201c[Wjhere the defense has the opportunity to cross-examine a witness concerning the disputed issue and to present its own version of the case, the likelihood of any error in admitting summary evidence diminishes.\u201d) (quotation marks omitted). Under those circumstances, we find no abuse of discretion or plain error in the district court\u2019s decision to admit into evidence the government\u2019s summary charts.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-4\">Scotton next contends that the district court erred when it denied his motion for a mistrial based on comments that allegedly violated his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. On several occasions, sometimes in the presence of the jury, the trial judge admonished Scot-ton that he could only ask questions during his examination of witnesses. She also reminded Scotton that if he wanted to testify, he would have to do so \u201cfrom the witness stand.\u201d Scotton argues that those reprimands impermissibly emphasized his decision not to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-5\">A remark violates a defendant\u2019s Fifth Amendment right to remain silent if it is \u201cmanifestly intended to be a comment on the defendant\u2019s failure to testify\u201d or if it is \u201cof such a character that the jury would naturally and necessarily take it to be a comment on the defendant\u2019s silence.\u201d <em>United States v. Knowles, </em>66 F.3d 1146, 1163 (11th Cir.1995) (quotation marks omitted). The defendant bears the burden of proving one of those two criteria. <em>Id. </em>\u201c[W]e must examine the comments in the context within which they were made.\u201d <em>Williams v. Wainwright, </em>673 F.2d 1182, 1184 (11th Cir.1982). Because the trial judge is in the best position to evaluate the comments in context, we review the denial of a motion for mistrial only for abuse of discretion. <em>Knowles, </em>66 F.3d at 1163.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-7\">The trial judge\u2019s remarks were not \u201cmanifestly intended\u201d to comment on Scot-ton\u2019s failure to testify. <em>Id. </em>Her statements were clearly designed to ensure that the trial was conducted properly and to remind Scotton, who represented himself, of the court\u2019s rules. <em>See United States v. Swindall, </em>971 F.2d 1531, 1551-52 (11th Cir.1992) (explaining that a statement cannot be \u201cmanifestly intended\u201d to comment on the defendant\u2019s failure to testify if \u201csome other explanation for [the] remark is equally plausible\u201d). Nor would the jury have \u201cnaturally and necessarily\u201d taken the trial judge\u2019s remarks as a comment on Scotton\u2019s right to silence. <em>Knowles, </em>66 F.3d at 1163. In fact, it\u2019s highly unlikely that they would have done so, given the trial judge\u2019s explicit instruction that Scot-ton \u201chas the absolute right not to testify\u201d and that if he chose not to testify, the jury could not \u201chold that against him.\u201d <em>See Swindall, </em>971 F.2d at 1552 (noting that \u201cthe trial court\u2019s curative instruction was adequate\u201d to prevent the jury from construing a statement by the prosecutor as an impermissible comment on the defendant\u2019s Fifth Amendment right).</p>\n<p id=\"b974-8\">Finally, Scotton contends that the district court erred at sentencing by attributing a loss amount of $2,663,385.43 to him, which resulted in an 18-level increase in his base offense level. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(l)(J). He argues that the government failed to adequately prove that loss amount because it relied on spreadsheets that summarized thousands of fraudulent transactions instead of the actual records of those transactions themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"951\">*951</page-number>The sentencing guidelines provide for an increased offense level based on the amount of loss attributable to a defendant\u2019s fraudulent conduct. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(l). \u201cA sentencing court need only make a reasonable estimate of the loss, given the available information.\u201d <em>United States v. Barrington, </em>648 F.3d 1178, 1197 (11th Cir.2011) (quotation marks omitted). But the court \u201cmay not speculate about the existence of a fact that would result in a higher sentence,\u201d and the government must prove the loss by a preponderance of the evidence using \u201creliable and specific evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted); <em>see United States v. Medina, </em>485 F.3d 1291, 1304 (11th Cir.2007). Because the district court \u201cis in a unique position to assess the evidence and estimate the loss,\u201d its \u201closs determination is entitled to appropriate deference.\u201d <em>Barrington, </em>648 F.3d at 1197. We review it only for clear error. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b975-5\">At sentencing, the government submitted several spreadsheets based on data provided to it by UPS, FedEx, and DHL Express about the loss associated with Scotton\u2019s fraudulent shipments. A federal agent testified about how that data was collected and compiled. And Scotton has \u201csubmitted no proof that the [gjovernment\u2019s averages, estimates, or results are so wildly inaccurate as to be unreasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Bradley, </em>644 F.3d 1213, 1292 (11th Cir.2011). The district court, therefore, \u201cdid not engage in the kind of speculation forbidden by the [s]en-tencing [gjuidelines\u201d in determining the amount of loss attributable to Scotton. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b975-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b973-7\">. Scotton actually objected to the admission of Exhibit 130 under the \u201cbest evidence rule,\u201d but he argued that he had not received the records supporting the exhibit before trial. We will construe his <em>pro se </em>objection liberally as challenging the government\u2019s failure to comply with the requirements of Rule 1006,</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
