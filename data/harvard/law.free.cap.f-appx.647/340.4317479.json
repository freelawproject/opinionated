He objected to the presentence report arguing that his sentence should not have been enhanced pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b). The district court overruled the objection. He received a within-guidelines sentence of 14 months of imprisonment and a 3-year term of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-21\">Garcia-De La Cruz argues that his sentence should not have been enhanced pursuant to \u00a7 1326(b) based on his commission of a felony before his prior deportation because that felony was not pleaded in the instant indictment and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. He challenges the validity of <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and <em>Alleyne v.

Gareia-De La Cruz concedes that his argument is foreclosed and raises it to preserve it for further review. In its unopposed motion for summary -affir-mance, the Government agrees that the issue is foreclosed and alternately moves for an extension of time to file a. brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">The motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED, the alternative motion for an extension of time to file a brief is DENIED, and the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b364-22\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
