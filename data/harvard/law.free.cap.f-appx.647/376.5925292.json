The district court originally sentenced him to 90 months \u2014 within the guideline range of 87 to 108 months \u2014 for possessing with intent to distribute cocaine. The court went below the 10-year statutory minimum in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) \u2014 even though the offense involved more than five kilograms of cocaine \u2014 because Aguilar-Sanchez met the conditions for the safety valve in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f). Later, the Sentencing Commission retroactively lowered the guideline range to 70 to 87 months, <em>see </em>U.S.S.GApp. C, Amend. 782, and the parties moved the court to reduce the sentence to 72 months under \u00a7 3582(c)(2),</p>\n<p id=\"b400-20\">The district court acknowledged Aguilar-Sanchez\u2019s eligibility for a reduction but denied it. We review that decision for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Henderson, </em>636 F.3d 713, 717 (5th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-21\">Aguilar-Sanchez claims that the court gave improper weight to the unusually <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>high purity of the cocaine, which the court noted can be a basis for an upward departure. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, comment, (n. 27(C)). The court was not upwardly departing here but, instead, was only considering the relevant factors. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(1), (2)(A), (5)(A); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment, (n. 1(B)), p.s.; <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.7. Aguilar-Sanchez also urges that the court should not have treated the prior safety-valve reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(16) and 5C1.2 and \u00a7 3553(f) as weighing against a reduction in the sentence, but the court properly took into account the context of the original sentence when it decided against a reduction. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 673 &amp; n. 11 (5th Cir.2009); <em>see also </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A). Aguilar-Sanchez\u2019s contention that the court failed to accord adequate weight to the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities, <em>see </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(6), is also unavailing. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>595 F.3d 1322, 1323 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b400-22\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir, R, 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir, R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
