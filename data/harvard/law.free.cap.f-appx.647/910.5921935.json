Backhus, attorney for deceased death row inmate Chadwick Dewellyn Banks, appeals the district court\u2019s denial of Banks\u2019s nunc pro tunc motion for appointment of Backhus as counsel to represent Banks in his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action. This appeal requires us to determine whether a district court may decline to \u201cextend\u201d an attorney\u2019s 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3599(a)(2) appointment to include a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action and related application for stay of execution under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3599(e) if the \u00a7 1983 claims were conclusively time barred or wholly futile. We answer that question in the affirmative and affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-13\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b935-14\">We previously outlined Banks\u2019s case in detail in <em>Banks v. Sec\u2019y, Fla. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>592 Fed.Appx. 771 (11th Cir.2014) (per curiam). Relevant to this appeal are the motions Backhus filed on behalf of Banks just before Banks\u2019s execution. While Banks\u2019s 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition for federal habeas relief was pending before the District Court for the Northern District of Florida, Banks\u2019s counsel withdrew, and Banks requested that Backhus be appointed as his federal habeas counsel.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court granted the motion for appointment but ultimately dismissed the \u00a7 2254 petition as untimely. <em>Id. </em>at 772.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-15\">On November 10, 2014, Backhus filed, on Banks\u2019s behalf in federal district court, a \u00a7 1983 action alleging violations of Banks\u2019s Eighth and Fourteenth Amend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"912\">*912</page-number>ment rights and a related application for stay of execution \u201cpending disposition of his pending Emergency Complaint pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.\u201d The complaint included a \u201cconstitutional claim for ineffective assistance of [state appointed] post-conviction counsel\u201d and a claim \u201cthat Florida\u2019s clemency process violate[d] [Banks\u2019s] constitutional rights to equal protection and due process of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 773. The district court denied Banks\u2019s request for a stay on November 11, 2014. <em>Id. </em>at 772, On November 13, 2014, we affirmed. <em>Id. </em>at 774. Separately, the Supreme Court denied a petition for writ of certiorari. <em>Banks v. Florida, </em>- U.S. \u2014\u2014, 135 S.Ct. 511, 511-12, 190 L.Ed.2d 386 (2014) (mem.). Banks was executed that evening.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-4\">On November 13, 2014, Backhus also learned that her original appointment as Banks\u2019s counsel was not considered to include representation of Banks in his \u00a7 1983 action. Accordingly, Backhus filed, on behalf of Banks, a motion to appoint Backhus as counsel for that representation nunc pro tunc to October 1, 2014, Judge Vinson denied that motion on November 14, 2014. However, the motion had been incorrectly filed before Judge Vinson. Therefore, Backhus \u201crefiled\u201d the motion before Judge Walker on January 27, 2015, requesting appointment for her work in Banks\u2019s \u00a7 1983 action nunc pro tunc to November 7, 2014. Judge Walker denied the motion based on his determination that Banks\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claims \u201cwere wholly futile\u201d and, therefore, undeserving of federally funded counsel under \u00a7 3599. Backhus filed this appeal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b936-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b936-8\">\u201cWe review the [district [c]ourt\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 3599 de novo.\u201d <em>Gary, </em>686 F.3d at 1272-73. However, we review a district court\u2019s decision not to extend representation under \u00a7 3599(e) only for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Christeson v. Roper, </em>574 U.S.-,-, 135 S.Ct. 891, 894, 190 L.Ed.2d 763 (2015) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b936-11\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b936-12\">Backhus was appointed to represent Banks in his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 federal ha-beas proceedings under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 848(q)(4)(B) \u2014 the predecessor statute to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3599(a)(2).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Section 3599(a)(2) provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b936-13\">In any post conviction proceeding under [28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2254 or 2255], seeking to vacate or set aside a death sentence, any defendant who is or becomes financially unable to obtain adequate representation .., <em>shall he entitled </em>to the appointment of one or more attorneys ,.. in accordance with subsections (b) through CO.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b936-15\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3599(a)(2) (emphasis added). In fact, \u00a7 3599(a)(2) creates a mandatory statutory right to counsel for indigent death row inmates to pursue federal habe-as relief under \u00a7\u00a7 2254 or 2255. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"913\">*913</page-number><em>Weeks v. Jones, </em>100 F.3d 124, 127 (11th Cir.1996) (per curiam). The subsequent subsections further define the representation available. Relevant to this case is subsection (e), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b937-4\">Unless replaced by similarly qualified counsel upon the attorney\u2019s own motion or upon motion of the defendant, each attorney so appointed shall represent the defendant throughout every subsequent stage of available judicial proceedings, including ... all available post-conviction process, together with applications for stays of execution and other appropriate motions and procedures, and shall also represent the defendant in such competency proceedings and proceedings for executive or other clemency as may be available to the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AJnr\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3599(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b937-5\">The language of \u00a7 3599(e) appears to be broad, requiring counsel appointed under \u00a7 3599(a) to \u201ccontinue to represent the prisoner \u2018throughout <em>every </em>subsequent stage of available judicial proceedings,\u201d\u2019 <em>see Gary, </em>686 F.3d at 1273, but it is limited in two important ways. First, in the case of an attorney appointed under \u00a7 3599(a)(2) to represent a \u00a7 2254 petitioner, representation under \u00a7 3599(e) is generally limited to \u201cthose proceedings that <em>ordinaHly </em>occur subsequent\u201d to \u201cthe filing of the [federal] habeas petition.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 1273-74 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Second, although a proceeding may be of a type that typically arises subsequent to the filing of a federal habeas petition, a district court may decline to extend the attorney\u2019s representation under \u00a7 3599(e) to pursue claims that are \u201cwholly futile,\u201d such as \u201cclaims that are conclusively time barred or could not form the basis for ... relief.\u201d <em>See Lambrix v. Sec\u2019y, Fla. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>756 F.3d 1246, 1259 (11th Cir.2014),</p>\n<p id=\"b937-10\">The district court here did not abuse its discretion in declining to extend Backhus\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"914\">*914</page-number>\u00a7 3599 representation to cover her work on either of Banks\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claims. In an earlier stage of this litigation, we concluded that Banks\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of state appointed post-conviction counsel was clearly time barred. <em>See Banks, </em>592 Fed.Appx. at 773. Additionally, we effectively determined that Banks\u2019s challenge to the constitutionality of Florida\u2019s clemency process was futile because he \u201cmade no conceivable allegation\u201d that would have established a claim for relief. <em>See id. </em>Therefore, the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to \u201cexpand\u201d Backhus\u2019s authorized representation under \u00a7 3599(e) to include work performed on Banks\u2019s \u00a7 1983 action.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b938-5\">For the reasons stated, the district court\u2019s denial of Banks\u2019s nunc pro tunc motion for appointment of Backhus as counsel to represent Banks in his \u00a7 1983 action and related application for stay of execution is</p>\n<p id=\"b938-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b935-11\">. The 2005 motion sought appointment of Backhus \"to represent Mr. Banks in his Sec. 2254 federal habeas proceedings pursuant to 28 U.S.C. sec. 848,\u201d and stated that \"[Banks\u2019s recently withdrawn counsel] had been appointed ... pursuant to Criminal Justice Act[,] 28 U.S.C. Sec. 848.\u201d In fact, Banks\u2019s recently withdrawn counsel was appointed pursuant to <em>21 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 848(q)(4)(B); <em>28 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 848 does not, and did not, exist. Therefore, we presume that the 2005 motion actually sought appointment under <em>21 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 848 and understand the reference to <em>28 </em>U.S.C \u00a7 848 to be a typo.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-16\">The appropriate subsection for Banks\u2019s requested appointment of federal habeas counsel would have been 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 848(q)(4)(B). To the extent Backhus contends that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3006A is the relevant provision, the Supreme Court has explained that \"[i]n 1988, Congress enacted the legislation now known as \u00a7 3599 to govern appointment of counsel in capital cases, thus displacing \u00a7 3006A for persons facing execution (but retaining that section for all others).\u201d <em>See Martel v. Clair, </em>565 U.S.-,-, 132 S.Ct. 1276, 1284, 182 L.Ed.2d 135 (2012).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b936-5\">. Though Backhus titled the relevant 2014 motion a \"motion for appointment of coun: sel,\u201d the motion was effectively seeking to \u201cexpand the authorized scope of her representation\u201d under \u00a7 3599, <em>See Harbison v. Bell, 556 U.S. </em>180, 182-83, 129 S.Ct. 1481, 1484-85, 173 L.Ed.2d 347 (2009). We have jurisdiction to review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to expand representation under \u00a7 3599, <em>See id. </em>(locating jurisdiction in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291); <em>see also Gary v. Warden, Ga. Diagnostic Prison, </em>686 F.3d 1261, 1271 n. 21, 1272 n. 26 (11th Cir.2012) (same).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b936-16\">. The predecessor and modern statutes are identical in all relevant respects. <em>See, e.g., Harbison, </em>556 U.S. at 190, 129 S.Ct. at 1489; <em>Gary, </em>686 F.3d at 1263 n, 4 (court \"referred to [attorney\u2019s] appointments [pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 848(q)(4)(B) ] as if they were made under \u00a7 3599 for the sake of clarity\u201d because \"[t]he relevant language of the two statutes is the same,\u201d)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b937-6\">. Some \u00a7 1983 actions are of the type that \"ordinarily occur subsequent\u201d to the filing of a \u00a7 2254 petition. For example, Banks\u2019s \u00a7 1983 challenge to the constitutionality of Florida\u2019s clemency process is of that type. \"A clemency proceeding, by its nature, will typically occur subsequent to the prisoner\u2019s unsuccessful collateral attack on the constitutional validity of his conviction or death sentence.\u201d <em>Gary, </em>686 F.3d at 1275. Correlatively, a \u00a7 1983 challenge to the constitutionality of a clemency proceeding will also ordinarily follow a \u00a7 2254 proceeding. Section 1983 is the appropriate vehicle by which to bring a challenge to the constitutionality of a clemency proceeding. See <em>Valle v, Sec'y, Fla. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>654 F.3d 1266, 1267 (11th Cir.2011) (per curiam). Therefore, a \u00a7 1983 action challenging the constitutionality of a state\u2019s clemency process would qualify as a \"subsequent proceeding\u201d under \u00a7 3599(e) where counsel has been appointed under \u00a7 3599(a)(2) to represent a \u00a7 2254 petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-7\">We are unpersuaded by the appellees\u2019 argument that section 210.20.50(c) of the Judicial Conference\u2019s Criminal Justice Act (CJA) Guidelines precludes CJA compensation for all \u00a7 1983 actions brought on behalf of prisoners. <em>See </em>7 Guidelines for Administration of Criminal Justice Act \u00a7 210.20.50(c). The plain language of a statute trumps contradictory language in advisory guidelines. <em>See United States v. Hill, </em>783 F.3d 842, 846 (11th Cir.2015). For example, in this case, Banks\u2019s \u00a7 1983 action was filed to pursue additional judicial process, in conjunction with a request for stay of execution, and therefore fell within the \"all available post-conviction process, together with applications for stays of execution and other appropriate motions and procedures\u201d language of \u00a7 3599(e). That is, where a \u00a7 1983 claim is brought with or implicitly seeks a stay of execution, \u00a7 3599(e)\u2019s express reference to \"stays of execution\u201d displaces the CJA Guidelines\u2019 generic reference to \u00a7 1983 actions to the extent that the latter would preclude all \u00a7 1983 claims. <em>See also Hooper v. Jones, </em>536 Fed.Appx. 796, 800 &amp; n. 6 (10th Cir.2013) (holding that prisoner\u2019s \u00a7 1983 method-of-execution action constituted \"pursuit of] an <em>appropriate procedure </em>seeking a <em>stay of execution </em>\u2014 a course that tracks the specific language in \u00a7 3599(e) identifying judicial proceedings to which a CJA appointment properly extends.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b938-7\">ED CARNES, Chief Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Ans\">concurring:</p>\n<p id=\"b938-8\">I concur in the result the Court reaches, which is to affirm the district court\u2019s denial of the motion for appointment, after the fact, of attorney Terri L. Backhus to represent Chadwick Banks in his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 lawsuit and related application for stay of execution. And I agree that the reason it was proper to deny that motion is that the \u00a7 1983 lawsuit was futile. We need say nothing more. All else is dicta.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
