The Government moved for a downward departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1. While the record is somewhat ambiguous as to whether the district court granted or denied this mo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>tion, the most plausible reading is that the district court granted the motion but nevertheless imposed a within-guidelines sentence. Speck-Edgmon raises two arguments on appeal, namely that the district court reversibly erred by granting the downward departure but sentencing her within the advisory guidelines range and that her sentence was substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">We engage in a bifurcated review of the sentence imposed by the district court, first considering whether the district court committed a \u201csignificant procedural error,\u201d such as \u201cfailing to consider the [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553(a) factors,\u201d or \u201cfailing to adequately explain the chosen sentence,\u201d and then reviewing the substantive reasonableness of the sentence for an abuse of discretion. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Notwithstanding the above, plain error review applies if the defendant fails to object in the district court. <em>United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391-92 (5th Cir.2007). To show plain error, the defendant must show a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and that affects her substantial rights. <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If she makes such a showing, this court has the discretion to correct the error but only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">Speck-Edgmon first contends that it was reversible error for the district court to grant the \u00a7 5K1.1 motion but sentence her within the guidelines range. As she did not object in the district court on these grounds, plain error review applies. While Speck-Edgmon is correct that it was error for the district court not to depart below the advisory guidelines range after granting the \u00a7 5K1.1 motion, the error was harmless. <em>See United States v. Hashimoto, </em>193 F.3d 840, 843-44 (5th Cir.1999). As in <em>Hashimoto, </em>the district court in this case \u201cclearly recognized its authority to depart from the statutory guidelines.\u201d <em>Id, </em>at 844. While the district court\u2019s statement that it would grant a departure is inconsistent with the sentence imposed, the district court indicated that it was granting a departure under \u00a7 5K1.1, explained the sentence it chose, and made clear that it was aware it had discretion to reduce Speck-Edgmon\u2019s sentence as it saw fit. <em>See Hashimoto, </em>193 F.3d at 844. Although Speck-Edgmon contends that <em>Hashimoto </em>should not guide our decision, without an applicable intervening change of law, one panel of this court may not overturn the decision of another panel. <em>United States v. Traxler, </em>764 F.3d 486, 489 (5th Cir.2014). Thus, while the district court erred by granting the motion for downward departure but failing to impose a sentence below the Guidelines, the sentence need not be vacated. <em>See Hashimoto, </em>193 F.3d at 843-44.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-9\">Speck-Edgmon also contends that her sentence was substantively unreasonable. A <em>post-Booker</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>discretionary sentence imposed within a properly calculated guidelines range is entitled to a rebuttable presumption of reasonableness. <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 360 (5th Cir.2009). While Speck-Edgmon argues that her within-guidelines sentence is not entitled to the presumption of reasonableness, she cites no case law or evidence in support of her arguments. There is no reason not to apply the presumption of reasonableness in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-10\">\u201cThe presumption of reasonableness is rebutted only upon a showing that the sentence does not account for a factor that should receive significant weight, it gives <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>significant weight to an irrelevant or improper factor, or it represents a clear error of judgment in balancing sentencing factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009). Speck-Edgmon\u2019s argument is nothing more than a disagreement with the district court over how the \u00a7 3553(a) factors should have been balanced, which is insufficient to overcome the presumption. <em>See United States v. Alvarado, </em>691 F.3d 592, 597 (5th Cir.2012). The district court listened to Speck-Edg-mon\u2019s arguments at the sentencing hearing and concluded that a within-guidelines sentence was appropriate. When imposing the sentence, the district court explicitly-stated that it considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors as they applied to Speck-Edgmon\u2019s individual history and behavior. We will not reweigh the \u00a7 3553(a) factors on appeal or reexamine their relative import. <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. The district court was in the best position to evaluate Speck-Edgmon\u2019s history and characteristics, as well as the need for the sentence imposed to further the objectives set forth in \u00a7 3553(a), and its decision is entitled to deference. <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51-52, 128 S.Ct. 586. Speck-Edgmon has not demonstrated that her sentence was substantively unreasonable. <em>See id. </em>at 50-53, 128 S.Ct. 586.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b404-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
