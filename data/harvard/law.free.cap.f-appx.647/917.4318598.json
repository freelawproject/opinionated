Although the issues were not advanced in District Court, he raises on appeal these issues:</p>\n<p id=\"b941-26\">(1) Whether venue was proper in the Southern District of Florida;</p>\n<p id=\"b941-27\">(2) Whether the fraudulent e-mail at issue in Count One was sent in furtherance of a fraudulent scheme; and</p>\n<p id=\"b941-28\">(3) Whether Counts Two through Eight of Phillips\u2019s indictment were multiplicitous.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"918\">*918</page-number>First, Phillips waived his objection to venue by not challenging it in the district court. <em>See United States v. Greer, </em>440 F.3d 1267, 1271 (11th Cir.2006). The superseding indictment itself laid out the facts being alleged and included the locations of each of the players in the scheme, thereby putting Phillips on notice of any alleged defect in venue from the moment the indictment was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-4\">Second, Count One of his indictment properly alleged a fraudulent transmission because the pertinent e-mail was sent in furtherance of Phillips\u2019s scheme to defraud. The elements of wire fraud under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343 are (1) the intentional participation in a scheme to defraud and (2) the use of the interstate wires in furtherance of the scheme. <em>United States v. Hasson, </em>333 F.3d 1264, 1270 (11th Cir.2003). The defendant need not have sent the wire, but rather the wire need only be reasonably foreseeable. <em>Id. </em>at 1270, 1272. It is not necessary that the transmitted information include any misrepresentation or for the transmission itself to be essential to the success of the scheme to defraud, but it can be \u201cincident to an essential part of the scheme\u201d or \u201ca step in the plot.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1272-73 (quoting <em>Schmuck v. United States, </em>489 U.S. 705, 710-11, 109 S.Ct. 1443, 1447-48, 103 L.Ed.2d 734 (1989)). Thus, a \u201croutine and innocent\u201d mailing can form the basis of a wire-fraud conviction if it was an essential part of the scheme. <em>See Schmuck, </em>489 U.S. at 713-14, 109 S.Ct. at 1449-50 (holding that the mailing of innocent title applications after a fraudulent sale took place to complete the transaction was part of a fraudulent scheme because they were necessary for the passage of title); <em>United States v. Waymer, </em>55 F.3d 564, 569-70 (11th Cir.1995) (holding that the innocent act of mailing checks supplied the mailing element for the defendant\u2019s mail-fraud conviction because the mailings were in furtherance of the scheme to defraud).</p>\n<p id=\"b942-6\">Here, although the e-mail that Smejkal sent to Phillips was merely the transmission of an invoice template that did not include misrepresentations, it was a step in furtherance of Phillips\u2019s plot to defraud AWA and HSIII. <em>See Hasson, </em>333 F.3d at 1270. After receiving the template from Smejkal\u2019s husband, Phillips used that template to create and send the fraudulent invoices to AWA and HSIII, which were the subject of the wire-fraud charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-7\">Although Phillips argues that <em>Schmuck </em>and <em>Waymer </em>may imply that a mailing that is not necessary for a scheme or upon which a scheme was not dependent, is insufficient to be considered \u201cin furtherance\u201d of a fraudulent scheme, <em>Hasson </em>states that a transmission \u201cneed not be essential to the success of a scheme to defraud,\u201d as long as it is \u201cincident to an essential part of the scheme.\u201d <em>Schmuck, </em>489 U.S. at 713, 109 S.Ct. 1443; <em>Waymer, </em>55 F.3d at 569; <em>Hasson, </em>333 F.3d at 1270. Because the invoice template was incident to an essential part of the scheme, namely, the creation of fraudulent invoices, the district court did not err on Phillips\u2019s conviction on Count One.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-8\">Third, Phillips waived his objection to the multiplicity of his indictment by not challenging the issue before trial. <em>See United States v. Mastrangelo, </em>733 F.2d 793, 800 (11th Cir.1984). Phillips\u2019s indictment provided sufficient factual information for him to mount a challenge to any alleged multiplicity for Counts Two through Eight before trial, as the indictment included details about the date, subject matter, and context of the e-mails at issue in each count.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
