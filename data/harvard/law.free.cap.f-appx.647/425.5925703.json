According to Toombs, the district court erred in determining that the claims in his complaint were barred under <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), and thus frivolous. We find no abuse of discretion in the determination because the complaint seeks monetary damages from defense counsel, the prosecutor, and two police officers \u201cfor the unjustified deprivation of [Toombs\u2019s] life, liberty and property\u201d but does not allege that his conviction or sentence has been reversed, expunged, set aside, or otherwise undermined. <em>See Boyd v. Biggers, </em>31 F.3d 279, 283 (5th Cir.1994). Nor do we find an abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s determination that the complaint, which was duplicative of a prior \u00a7 1983 suit, was malicious. <em>See Bailey v. Johnson, </em>846 F.2d 1019, 1021 (5th Cir.1988). Further, Toombs fails to assert or demonstrate any error'in the district court\u2019s rejection of his DNA testing claim, which he raised in a postjudgment motion. <em>See Skinner v. Switzer, </em>562 U.S. 521, 525, 131 S.Ct. 1289, 179 L.Ed.2d 233 (2011); <em>Disk Attorney\u2019s Office for Third Judicial Dist. v. Osborne, </em>557 U.S. 52, 69, 129 S.Ct. 2308, 174 L.Ed.2d 38 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-20\">The appeal is DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. The motions for an evidentiary hearing and to compel the production of evidence are DENIED. We previously warned Toombs that he had two strikes under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). The district court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint in this ease, as well as o\u00fcr dismissal of this appeal, count as additional strikes. <em>See Coleman v. Tollefson, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 135 S.Ct. 1759, 1763-64, 191 L.Ed.2d 803 (2015); <em>Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387 (5th Cir.1996). Because Toombs has accumulated more than three strikes, he is BARRED from proceeding IFP in any civil action while he is incarcerated unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b449-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir, R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
