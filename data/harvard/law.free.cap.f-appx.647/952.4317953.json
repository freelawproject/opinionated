In his \u00a7 2241 petition, Burgess claimed he was not afforded sufficient due process before this punishment was imposed because he did not receive written notice of the charge against him, as contained in a copy of the incident report regarding the fight, until after his DHO hearing. The district court denied the petition, finding that Burgess received the incident report at least 24 hours prior to the DHO hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-9\">\u201cPrison disciplinary proceedings are not part of a criminal prosecution, and the full panoply of rights due a defendant in such proceedings does not apply.\u201d <em>Wolff v. McDonnell, </em>418 U.S. 539, 556, 94 S.Ct. 2963, 41 L.Ed.2d 935 (1974). However, when a prison disciplinary proceeding may result in the loss of good time credits, an inmate is entitled to the following procedural due process protections: (1) written notice of the charges against him, provided at least 24 hours before the proceeding; (2) an opportunity to call witnesses and present documentary evidence in his defense, when it will not be unduly hazardous to institutional safety or correctional goals; and (3) a written statement by the factfin-der as to the evidence relied upon and the reasons for the disciplinary action. <em>Id, </em>at 563-66, 94 S.Ct. 2963.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-12\">The district court did not err in denying Burgess\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition, as there was no clear error in its factual finding that Burgess received written notice of the charge against him, as contained in the incident report, at least 24 hours before the DHO hearing. <em>See Coloma v. Holder, </em>445 F.3d. 1282, 1284 (11th Cir.2006) (reviewing the denial of a \u00a7 2241 petition, and explaining we review the district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and questions of law <em>de </em>novo). In the incident report, Lieutenant L. Chaney indicated he delivered the report to Burgess on May 25, 2012, prior to the DHO hearing on June 5, 2012. The DHO report also indicated that Chaney provided Burgess a copy of the incident report on May 25, 2012. Further, although Burgess was notified before the DHO hearing of his right to receive a written copy of the charge against him, and received the DHO report, which indicated that he received a copy of the incident report before the DHO hearing, at no point during the DHO hearing or the administrative appeal process did he claim that he did not receive the incident report before the DHO hearing. Thus, we are not left with the \u201cdefinite and firm conviction\u201d that the district court\u2019s factual finding was wrong. <em>See Branch v. Sec\u2019y, Fla. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>638 F.3d 1353, 1356 (11th Cir.2011) (explaining a finding of fact \u201cis clearly erroneous when we are left with the \u2018definite and firm conviction that it is wrong\u2019 \u2019<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b977-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b977-10\">. We do not consider Burgess\u2019s argument that his due process rights were violated because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"954\">*954</page-number>he was not provided with a written statement by the factfinder as to the evidence relied upon and the reasons for the disciplinary action until after the sanction was imposed at the DHO hearing, as he raises it for the first time on appeal. <em>See Mills v. Singletary, </em>63 F.3d 999, 1008 n. 11 (11th Cir.1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
