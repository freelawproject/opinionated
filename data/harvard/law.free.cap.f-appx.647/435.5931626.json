The district court sentenced Rodriguez to 180 months of imprisonment and six years of supervised release. Rodriguez appeals his sentence, arguing that the district court erred by imposing a three-level enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(b) based on his role as a manager or supervisor in the offense. However, Rodriguez\u2019s plea agreement contains an appeal waiver provision that precludes his challenge to the district court\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-22\">In an attempt to avoid the enforcement of the appeal waiver, Rodriguez argues that his plea agreement is invalid because it is proeedurally and substantively unconscionable. He asserts that the plea agreement is proeedurally unconscionable because the parties had unequal bargaining power. He further asserts that the agreement is substantively unconscionable because it is \u201cgrossly one sided,\u201d as he maintains that he gave up numerous important rights and received \u201cvery little, if anything\u201d in return.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-23\">Because Rodriguez did not challenge the validity of the plea agreement in the district court and did not attempt to withdraw his plea on grounds that the plea agree<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>ment was unconscionable, we apply plain error review to his claims. <em>See United States v. Vonn, </em>535 U.S. 55, 58-59, 122 S.Ct. 1043, 152 L.Ed.2d 90 (2002). Our review of the plea agreement reve\u00e1is no plain error with respect to Rodriguez\u2019s unconscionability arguments. Rodriguez was free to reject the agreement and to either go'to trial or plead guilty without a plea agreement, and the plea agreement provided Rodriguez with significant benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">The appeal waiver in the plea agreement bars Rodriguez\u2019s challenge to the district court\u2019s sentence. Accordingly, the appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b459-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
