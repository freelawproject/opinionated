He challenges his sentence of 60 months of imprisonment, imposed to run consecutively to his undischarged state sentence for aggravated assault. Green contends the district court should have applied U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3(b), as he requested at sentencing, and run his federal sentence concurrently with his state sentence. He argues that the district court committed procedural error by fading to consider the appropriate guidelines range and whether \u00a7 5G1.3(b)(2) applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-23\">Although Green objected to the district court\u2019s failure to apply \u00a7 5G1.3(b)(2) to make his sentence concurrent, he did not specifically argue in the district court, as he does now, that the district court failed to consider whether that Guideline applied in order to determine the guideline sentence. Thus, we review his claim of procedural unreasonableness for plain error. <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 361 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-24\">A district court retains the discretion to impose a consecutive sentence as a departure or variance even when \u00a7 5G1.3(b) applies. <em>United States v. Bell, </em>46 F.3d 442, 446 (5th Cir.1995); <em>United States v. Ran-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number><em>gel, </em>319 F.3d 710, 713 (5th Cir.2003). Contrary to Green\u2019s assertion, there is no indication that the district court failed to consider his argument for a concurrent sentence. Green\u2019s attorney argued that \u00a7 5G1.3(b) applied, and the district court expressed its opinion that the Guideline did not constrain the court\u2019s ability to vary from the Guidelines. The district court rejected Green\u2019s request to impose a concurrent sentence and imposed a 60-month consecutive sentence as a variance. Green has not shown that the district court plainly erred by failing to consider \u00a7 5G1.3(b) or the appropriate guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">Green argues that the district court\u2019s sentence was greater than necessary to satisfy the purposes of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). He contends that the sentence was substantively unreasonable based on the variance upward to 60 months and because it was imposed to run consecutively-</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">We review the substantive reasonableness of a sentence, whether inside or outside of the guidelines range and including its nature as consecutive, for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>517 F.3d 801, 807-08 (5th Cir.2008); <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51-52, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>United States v. Candia, </em>454 F.3d 468, 474-75 (5th Cir.2006). The reasonableness inquiry is guided by the factors in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519 (5th Cir.2005). If the district court elects to impose a non-guideline sentence, it should carefully articulate the reasons for concluding that the sentence selected is appropriate. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">The district court clearly stated its intention to impose a sentence above the advisory guideline range based on the factors listed in \u00a7 3553(a). The district court noted Green\u2019s persistent pattern of firearm-related violent crimes and the fact that he had no verifiable history of gainful employment and concluded that a sentence greater than the guidelines range was appropriate to protect the public and to deter Green from future crimes. Green\u2019s argument is essentially a disagreement with the district court\u2019s assessment of what constitutes a reasonable sentence and amounts to a request for this court to reweigh the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. That this court \u201cmight reasonably have concluded that a different sentence was appropriate is insufficient to justify reversal of the district court.\u201d Gall, 552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. Green has failed to show that his sentence is unreasonable in light of the court\u2019s consideration of the sentencing factors and its detailed explanation of reasons for imposing the 60-month sentence to run consecutively to his state sentence. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b531-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
