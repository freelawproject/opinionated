He has abandoned any challenge to the denial of withholding of removal or relief under the CAT by failing to brief those issues adequately. <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993); <em>see also Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>F.3d 830, 833 (5th Cir.2003). Even if Chi-edzie had briefed his CAT claim, he failed to exhaust that claim because he did not argue to the BIA that he was entitled to such relief, such that we lack jurisdiction to review it. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1); <em>Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>260 F.3d 448, 452 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">As for his asylum claim, Chiedzie argues that he showed extraordinary circumstances to excuse his untimely filing of that application and that the IJ erred when he determined that Chiedzie was not credible. Generally, we have authority to review only the decision of the BIA but will consider the IJ\u2019s decision if it influenced the determination of the BIA. <em>Zhu v. Gonzales, </em>493 F.3d 588, 593 (5th Cir.2007). Because the BIA agreed with the IJ\u2019s findings and conclusions, the IJ\u2019s findings are reviewable. <em>See Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 903 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">Whether the BIA improperly weighed or ignored evidence regarding Chiedzie\u2019s untimely filing involves questions of fact and does not raise a constitutional or legal question, and thus we lack jurisdiction to address it. <em>See Nakimbugwe v. Gonzales, </em>475 F.3d 281, 284 &amp; n. 1 (5th Cir.2007). Accordingly, the asylum claim is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. <em>See Zhu, </em>493 F.3d at 594-95.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">DISMISSED in part; DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b403-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
