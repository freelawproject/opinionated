Lanphier challenges the restitution order of approximately $5.98 million, imposed following his guilty plea to failure to pay employment taxes, in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7202. For the first time on appeal, he asserts the court exceeded its statutory authority to impose restitution under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663(a), claiming that, pursuant to the plea-agreement\u2019s plain language, the amount exceeds that agreed upon by the parties. (The Government does <em>not </em>claim Lanphier\u2019s limited waiver of his right to appeal bars review of the issue presented.)</p>\n<p id=\"b442-20\">Under that agreement, the parties stated the court \u201cwill order full restitution from [Lanphier\u2019s] scheme, as outlined in paragraph 11 above, in an amount to be determined by the Court\u201d; and <em>\u201cshall not be limited to the counts of conviction in determining and ordering full restitution\u201d. </em>(Emphasis added.) Paragraph 11 described Lanphier\u2019s failure to pay employment taxes between 2008 and 2011 (totaling more than $2.5 million), but not any failures to pay employment taxes before 2008; but, it also described other failures regarding his personal federal income-tax returns starting in 2002. Moreover, the parties stipulated \u201cthe loss caused by [his] scheme was more than $2.5 million but not more than $7 million\u201d, and stated Lanphier understood \u201cthe Court may ... order restitution in accordance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>with the law\u201d, which he confirmed at arraignment and at sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">The parties agree the court was authorized, as stated in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663(a)(3), to \u201corder restitution ... to the extent agreed to by the parties in a plea agreement\u201d. <em>See United States v. Simmons, </em>420 Fed.Appx. 414, 421 (5th Cir.2011). Therefore, although Lanphier frames his contention as the restitution\u2019s exceeding the court\u2019s statutory authority because it includes tax years preceding 2008, his claim does not require interpreting \u00a7 3663(a)(3). Instead, only the quantum of restitution intended under the plea agreement need be addressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">The Pre-Sentence Investigation Report (PSR) calculated unpaid employment taxes in each year between 2005 and 2011. The court relied on the PSR in setting the amount for restitution and specifically included amounts of restitution for each of those years. Because Lanphier did not object either to the calculations provided in the PSR or the court\u2019s reliance on the PSR in setting-the amount of restitution, review is only for plain error. <em>E.g., United States v. De Leon, </em>728 F.3d 500, 507 (5th Cir.2013); <em>United States v. Rosbottom, </em>763 F.3d 408, 419 (5th Cir.2014), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 985, 190 L.Ed.2d 836 (2015), <em>and cert. denied sub nom. Kisla v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 989, 190 L.Ed.2d 836 (2015). Under that standard, Lanphier must show a forfeited plain (clear or obvious) error that affected his substantial rights. <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If he does so, we have the discretion to correct the reversible plain error, but should do so only if it \u201cseriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings\u201d. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b443-10\">The district court\u2019s interpretation of the plea agreement is subject to reasonable dispute; therefore, it is not <em>clearly </em>erroneous. <em>See Puckett, </em>556 U.S. at 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423. In the alternative, Lanphier\u2019s substantial rights were not affected: the amount of restitution represents actual loss caused by his scheme; the court confirmed Lanphier understood he could be required to pay \u201cfull restitution\u201d; and, although the court could have imposed additional financial penalties, it refrained from doing so. <em>See Puckett, </em>556 U.S. at 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423; <em>United States v. Miller, </em>406 F.3d 323, 330-31 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b442-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
