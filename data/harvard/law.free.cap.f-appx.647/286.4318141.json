By moving to proceed IFP, Phipps is challenging the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal was not taken in good faith because it is frivolous. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). Our inquiry into an appellant\u2019s good faith \u201cis limited to whether the appeal involves legal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-22\">The Supreme Court has prescribed a two-step inquiry for a district court\u2019s consideration of a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>Dillon v. United States, </em>560 U.S. 817, 826, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010). The district court must first determine whether a prisoner is eligible for a reduction as set forth in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a). <em>Id. </em>If he is eligible, then the district court must \u201cconsider any applicable [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553(a) factors and determine whether, in its discretion,\u201d any reduction is warranted under the particular facts of the case. <em>Id. </em>at 827, 130 S.Ct. 2683. We review the district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Henderson, </em>636 F.3d 713, 717 (5th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-23\">The district court implicitly found Phipps eligible for a sentence reduction but indicated that his original sentence was within the amended guidelines range and that a sentence reduction was not warranted. The district court\u2019s order indicated that the court considered the policy statement under \u00a7 1B1.10 and the sentencing factors under \u00a7 3553(a), to the extent th\u00e9y were applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-24\">The district court was under no obligation to grant Phipps a sentence reduction despite his eligibility for one. <em>See United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 673 (5th Cir.2009). While the district court was permitted to consider the post-sentencing rehabilitative conduct cited in Phipps\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, the district court was not required to do so. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>\u00a7 1B1.10, comment, (n. l(B)(iii)); <em>Evans, </em>587 F.3d at 673 &amp; n. 10. The district court also was not required to provide reasons based on the \u00a7 3553(a) factors so long as it considered the factors. <em>See United States v. Cooley, </em>590 F.3d 293, 297-98 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">Phipps contends that the district court should have resentenced him to the low end of his amended guidelines range because the district court previously sentenced him to the low end of his original guidelines range. Phipps\u2019s argument does not show that the denial of his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion was an abuse of the district court\u2019s discretion, as the district court\u2019s order denying the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion reflects that the court considered Phipps\u2019s motion as a whole and the appropriate factors in denying a sentence reduction. <em>See Henderson, </em>636 F.3d at 717; <em>Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 673 (5th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d 1007, 1010 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">Phipps has not shown that he will raise a nonfrivolous issue on appeal. <em>See Howard, </em>707 F.2d at 220. Accordingly, his IFP motion is DENIED, and his appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 &amp; n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b310-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
