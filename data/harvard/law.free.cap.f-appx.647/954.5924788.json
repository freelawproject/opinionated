In 2009, With-row was convicted and sentenced for conspiring with intent to distribute around 70 grams of crack cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846. He was sentenced to a term of imprisonment above the statutory mandatory minimum for his offense, which at that time was 120 months\u2019 imprisonment under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1). In 2010, the Fair Sentencing Act (FSA) decreased the statutory mandatory minimum for offenses like Withrow\u2019s to 60 months\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See </em>Pub.L. No. 111-220, 124 Stat. 2372; 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1). Subsequently, Withrow filed his present motion for a sentence reduction, seeking relief based on Amendment 782 to the Sentencing Guidelines. The district court found Withrow eligible for relief under Amendment 782, but the court concluded that it could not lower his sentence below the relevant statutory mandatory minimum on a \u00a7 3582 motion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Finding that the pre-FSA 120-month minimum applies to Withrow, the court only reduced his sentence to 120 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-19\">On appeal, Withrow solely asserts that the district court erred by relying on the 120-month statutory mandatory minimum rather than the 60-month minimum currently in effect. However, this argument is unavailing. The FSA does not apply retroactively to Withrow. <em>See Hippolyte, </em>712 F.3d at 542; <em>Berry, </em>701 F.3d at 377. Because the FSA does not apply to With-row\u2019s case, the statutory mandatory minimum that does is the one that was in place when Withrow was sentenced in 2009. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"955\">*955</page-number><em>Hippolyte, </em>712 F.3d at 542. Accordingly, the district court did not err in relying on the 120-month -minimum when considering Withrow\u2019s \u00a7 3582 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b978-20\">. This determination was proper' \u2014 \u00a7 3582 does not authorize courts to reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence below the applicable statutory mandatory minimum prison term. <em>See United States v. Hippolyte, </em>712 F.3d 535, 540 (11th Cir.2013); <em>United States v. Berry, </em>701 F.3d 374, 376 (11th Cir.2012) (per curiam).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
