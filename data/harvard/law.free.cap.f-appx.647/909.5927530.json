On appeal, Cruitt argues that the seizure of his legal and evi-dentiary documents by state officials was a violation of clearly established constitutional rights; therefore, the District Court was authorized under the All Writs Act and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 to \u201cprotect its jurisdiction\u201d from the actions taken by the Alabama Department of Corrections to hinder his attempts to file a federal complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-18\">\u201cFederal law opens two main avenues to relief on complaints related to imprisonment: a petition for habeas corpus, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, and a complaint under the Civil Rights Act of 1871, ... as amended, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.\u201d <em>Muhammad v. Close, </em>540 U.S. 749, 750, 124 S.Ct. 1303, 1304, 158 L.Ed.2d 32 (2004). Challenges to the validity of confinement or to its duration are within the province of habeas corpus, while requests for relief relating to the circumstances of confinement may be presented in a \u00a7 1983 action. <em>Id. </em>A claim alleging a denial of access to courts is cognizable under \u00a7 1983. <em>Martin v. Wainwright, </em>526 F.2d 938, 939 (5th Cir.1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b933-19\">Federal courts have \u201can obligation to look behind the label of a [pleading] filed by a <em>pro se </em>inmate and determine whether [it] is, in effect, cognizable under a different remedial statutory framework.\u201d <em>See Gooden v. United States, </em>627 F.3d 846, 847 (11th Cir.2010) (quotation marks and citation omitted). The Supreme Court has noted that the purpose for looking beyond the label a <em>pro se </em>litigant attaches to a [pleading] is \u201cto avoid an unnecessary dismissal, to avoid inappropriately stringent application of formal labeling requirements, or to create a better correspondence between the substance of a <em>pro se </em>[pleading]\u2019s claim and its underlying legal basis.\u201d <em>Castro v. United States, </em>540 U.S. 375, 381-82, 124 S.Ct. 786, 791-92, 157 L.Ed.2d 778 (2003) (citations omitted). We liberally construe <em>pro se </em>briefs. <em>Timson v. Sampson, </em>518 F.3d 870, 874 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b934-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>Upon review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we vacate and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-4\">As an initial matter, on appeal, Cruitt persists in asserting his claims should proceed pursuant to the All Writs Act and \u00a7 2254; however, we construe a <em>pro se </em>litigant\u2019s briefs liberally. <em>See Timson, </em>518 F.3d at 874. We must look beyond the label a <em>pro se </em>litigant attached to his [pleading], and while Cruitt insists that his claims are properly brought as a habeas action, he discusses the right of state prisoners to allege violations of constitutional rights in federal courts, and asserts that the seizure of his documents was \u201ca clear violation of federal rights.\u201d Accordingly, we construe this as an argument under \u00a7 1983, rather than under \u00a7 2254.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-5\">The district court erred in dismissing Cruitt\u2019s pleading as a \u00a7 2254 petition. As the court found, the pleading appeared to raise an aceess-to-the-courts claim, which is a cognizable claim under \u00a7 1983, and he did not challenge the facts of his underlying conviction, which is required in a habe-as petition. <em>See Muhammad, </em>540 U.S. at 750, 124 S.Ct. at 1304. Therefore, the district court should have addressed the pleading as a complaint alleging a \u00a7 1983 claim. <em>See Gooden, </em>627 F.3d at 847. Moreover, although the court dismissed the pleading without prejudice, it potentially precluded Cruitt from seeking relief on some of his \u00a7 1983 claims based on the statute of limitations. <em>See </em>Ala.Code \u00a7 6-2-38(1); <em>Burton v. City of Belle Glade, </em>178 F.3d 1175, 1188 (11th Cir.1999). Accordingly, we vacate and remand for further proceedings consistent with construing Cruitt\u2019s pleadings as a \u00a7 1983 action.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-6\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
