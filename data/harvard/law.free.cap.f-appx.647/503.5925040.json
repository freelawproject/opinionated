He argues that the district court erred in relying on the confidential source\u2019s drug quantity information in the Presentence Report because there was no corroborating evidence to support it.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-21\">Because he did not challenge the reliability of the confidential source in the district court, review is limited to plain error. <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 361 (5th Cir.2009). To prevail on plain error review, Chavira must identify (1) a forfeited error (2) that is clear or obvious, and (3) that affects his substantial rights. <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If he satisfies these three requirements, this court may, in its discretion, remedy the error if it \u201cseriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-22\">The amount of methamphetamine attributable to Chavira is a finding of fact. <em>See United States v. Harris, </em>740 F.3d 956, 966 (5th Cir.2014). \u201cQuestions of. fact capable of resolution by the district court upon proper objection at sentencing can. never constitute plain error.\u201d <em>United States v. Lopez, </em>923 F.2d 47, 50 (5th Cir.1991). As such, the district court\u2019s finding of the applicable drug quantity cannot constitute plain error. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b527-23\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b527-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
