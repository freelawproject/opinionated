Rahman pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering in violation of 18 U.S.C., \u00a7\u00a7 1956(h), 1956(a)(1), and 1957. He now appeals that conviction, arguing that he was entitled to an interpreter at his change of plea hearing and that his attorney had a conflict of interest that rendered his assistance ineffective.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-8\">Rahman, who is not a native English speaker, contends that the magistrate judge plainly erred by failing to inquire into his need for an interpreter at his change of plea hearing. Under the Court Interpreters Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1827, a trial judge has a \u201cmandatory duty to inquire as to the need for an interpreter when a defendant has difficulty with English.\u201d <em>Valladares v. United States, </em>871 F.2d 1564, 1565 (11th Cir.1989), A defendant is entitled to an interpreter when he \u201c(1) speaks only or primarily a language other than the English language; <em>and </em>(2) this fact inhibits [his] comprehension of the proceedings or communication with counsel or the presiding judicial officer.\u201d <em>United States v. Edouard, </em>485 F.3d 1324, 1337 (11th Cir.2007) (emphasis added) (quotation marks omitted). \u201cThe appointment of an interpreter, both under the Court Interpreters Act and as a constitutional matter, is committed to the sound discretion of the trial judge.\u201d <em>Id, </em>We review the trial judge\u2019s decision to determine whether the failure to provide an interpreter rendered the proceeding \u201cfundamentally unfair.\u201d <em>Id,</em></p>\n<p id=\"b980-10\">Although Rahman needed clarification at a few points during his change of plea hearing, the record as a whole demonstrates that he understood the nature and significance of the proceeding. He was able to communicate with the magistrate judge and his attorney during the hearing. Neither he nor his attorney asked for an interpreter or objected to the lack of one. In short, nothing in the record suggests that Rahman had communication difficulties that required the magistrate judge to inquire about whether he needed an interpreter, And nothing suggests that the magistrate judge\u2019s decision not to appoint one made his change of plea hearing \u201cfundamentally unfair.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 1339-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-11\">Rahman next contends that he was denied his Sixth Amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel because the lawyer he retained to represent him also represented his wife. Rahman argues that this joint representation resulted in an actual conflict of interest because, in exchange for his guilty plea, the government allowed his wife to plead guilty to a misdemeanor charge and recommended that she be sentenced to time served. According to Rahman, his attorney encouraged him to accept a plea agreement that furthered his wife\u2019s interests at the expense of his own. Rahman also contends that the magistrate judge failed to conduct an adequate inquiry under FedR.Crim.P. 44(c) to determine whether he had waived his right to conflict-free counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-12\">Joint representation may result in a conflict that violates a defendant\u2019s right to counsel. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>982 F.2d 474, 476-77 (11th Cir.1993). A defendant \u201cmay waive this conflict of interest and elect to have the attorney continue representation, so long as that waiver is knowing, intelligent, and voluntary.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"957\">*957</page-number><em>United States v. Ross, </em>33 F.3d 1507, 1524 (11th Cir.1994). Absent such a waiver, \u201ca defendant is entitled to representation free of actual conflict.\u201d <em>United States v. Khoury, </em>901 F.2d 948, 968 (11th Cir.1990). \u201cA speculative or hypothetical conflict,\u201d however, \u201cdoes not violate the Constitution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A defendant must show that his lawyer \u201cactively represented conflicting interests,\u201d and that \u201cthe actual conflict had an adverse effect upon his lawyer\u2019s representation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted). He must be able to \u201cpoint to specific instances in the record to suggest an actual conflict or impairment of [his] interest.\u201d <em>Id.; see also United States v. Mers, </em>701 F.2d 1321, 1328 (11th. Cir.1983) (stating that a defendant \u201cmust make a factual showing of inconsistent interests and must demonstrate that the attorney made a choice between alternative courses of action\u201d; otherwise \u201cthe conflict remain[s] hypothetical\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b981-5\">We have recognized that \u201c[a] major difficulty with reviewing claims of ineffective assistance on direct appeal is that the lawyer in question did not make a record on the issue of ineffective assistance.\u201d <em>Khoury, </em>901 F.2d at 969. Accordingly, such claims \u201cmay not be raised on direct appeal where the claim has not been heard by the district court nor a factual record developed.\u201d <em>Id,; see also Massaro v. United States, </em>538 U.S. 500, 504, 123 S.Ct. 1690, 1694, 155 L.Ed.2d 714 (2003) (stating that the preferred means for deciding a claim of ineffective assistance is through a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion, \u201ceven if the record [on direct appeal] contains some indication of deficiencies in counsel\u2019s performance\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b981-6\">We agree with Rahman that the magistrate judge did not properly investigate whether he had waived his lawyer\u2019s alleged conflict. <em>See United States v. Garda, </em>517 F.2d 272, 276-78 (5th Cir.1975). That failure does not warrant reversal, however, unless Rahman can show that an actual conflict adversely affected him, making his lawyer\u2019s representation ineffective. <em>See Khoury, </em>901 F.2d at 968-69. Because Rahman did not raise the issue of his lawyer\u2019s conflict of interest in the district court, no factual record was developed on that issue. We therefore dismiss Rahman\u2019s ineffective assistance claim without prejudice to his reiterating that claim and having'it decided on its merits in a timely filed 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 proceeding. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b981-8\">AFFIRMED IN PART, DISMISSED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
