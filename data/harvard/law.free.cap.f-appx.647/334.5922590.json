Finding no abuse of discretion warranting relief, we deny Hoque\u2019s request for remand to the BIA and deny the petition for review. <em>See Altamirano-Lopez v. Gonzales, </em>435 F.3d 547, 549 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-21\">We agree with Hoque that the BIA should have considered the State Department\u2019s 2013 international religious freedom (IRF) report submitted with and discussed in his brief to the BIA. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1003.23(b)(3); <em>see also Zhao v. Gonzales, </em>404 F.3d 295, 304 (5th Cir.2005); <em>Abdel-Masieh v. INS, </em>73 F.3d 579, 585 (5th Cir.1996). However, the BIA\u2019s error is harmless because Hoque fails to demonstrate that he would be entitled to relief but for the error. <em>See Cantu-Delgadillo v. Holder, </em>584 F.3d 682, 690 (5th Cir.2009); <em>Beltran-Resendez v. INS, </em>207 F.3d 284, 287 (5th Cir.2000). The 2013 IRF report establishes no changed circumstances in Bangladesh excusing Hoque from the prohibitions against filing more than one motion to reopen and filing a motion to reopen more than 90 days after denial of immigration relief. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1003.23(b)(1), (b)(4)(i). Comparing the 2013 IRF report with the 2009 and 2012 IRF reports shows that conditions in Bangladesh continued largely unchanged or arguably worsened only incrementally, neither of which provides a sufficient basis for disregarding the time and numerical limitations on motions to reopen. <em>See Panjwawi v. Gonzales, </em>401 F.3d 626, 632 (5th Cir.2005). Hoque fails to demonstrate an abuse of discretion re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>quiring remand of his case to the BIA or reversal of the BIA\u2019s dismissal of his appeal. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b358-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
