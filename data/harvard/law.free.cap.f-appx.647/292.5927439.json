The only issue properly before this court is whether <em>Martinez v. Ryan, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 132 S.Ct. 1309, 182 L.Ed.2d 272 (2012), can be applied to excuse the procedural default of Hughes\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claims. <em>See Sonnier v. Johnson, </em>161 F.3d 941, 946 (5th Cir.1998). Pro se briefs are afforded liberal construction. <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 225 (5th Cir.1993). Nevertheless, it is well settled that an appellant \u201cabandons all issues not raised and properly presented in [his] initial brief on appeal.\u201d <em>Banks v. Thaler, </em>583 F.3d 295, 329 (5th Cir.2009). Because Hughes has failed to adequately brief his argument, he has abandoned the critical issue of this appeal. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b316-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined th\u00e1t this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cm. R. 47.5,4.
