(His concurrent sentences for the six robbery counts were subsequently reduced to 97 months, bringing his total sentence to 1,117 months\u2019 imprisonment.) Rainwater has attempted to pursue several 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 challenges to that sentence. <em>E.g., In re: Derrick D. Rainwater, </em>No. 06-10632, Doc. No. 9 (5th Cir. 8 Aug. 2006) (unpublished).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">Rainwater filed the \u00a7 2241 petition at issue in the Western District of Louisiana, where he is incarcerated. In that petition, he challenged the legality of his five \u00a7 924(c) convictions in the light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Rosemond v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 1240, 188 L.Ed.2d 248 (2014), discussed <em>infra. </em>The district court construed the petition as a \u00a7 2255 motion and dismissed it for lack of jurisdiction. That dismissal is reviewed <em>de novo. E.g., Pack v. Yusuff, </em>218 F.3d 448, 451 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-13\">Because Rainwater attacked the validity of his convictions, his petition was properly construed -as a \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See Tolliver v. Dobre, </em>211 F.3d 876, 877-78 (5th Cir.2000). But, a \u00a7 2255 motion must be filed in the sentencing court, which, as noted above, is the Northern District of Texas. \u00a7 2255(a); <em>e.g., Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 895 n. 3 (5th Cir.2001); <em>see also Solsona v. Warden, F.C.I., </em>821 F.2d 1129, 1132 (5th Cir.1987) (holding only the sentencing court has jurisdiction to hear a \u00a7 2255 motion attacking the sentence). Rainwater may avoid this requirement, however, if he can satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 2255(e)\u2019s \u201csavings clause\u201d; that is, he can show the remedy afforded by a \u00a7 2255 motion \u201cis inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of detention\u201d, therefore relief under \u00a7 2241 is proper. <em>Jeffers v. Chandler, </em>253 F.3d 827, 830 (5th Cir.2001) (emphasis omitted); \u00a7 2255(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-14\">Our circuit has established a three-part test to determine the applicability of the savings clause. Accordingly, Rainwater\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition must: raise a claim \u201cthat is based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision\u201d; that claim \u201cwas foreclosed by circuit law at the time when [it] should have been raised in [Rainwater\u2019s] trial, appeal or first \u00a7 2255 motion\u201d; and, that retroactively applicable decision \u201cestablishes that [Rainwater] may' have been convicted of a nonexistent offense\u201d. <em>Reyes-Requena, </em>243 F.3d at 904. As discussed below, Rainwater fails to ' show <em>Rosemond </em>establishes that he may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense; therefore, we need not address the other two parts of the savings-clause test. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number><em>Christopher v. Miles, </em>342 F.3d 378, 382 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">In <em>Rosemond, </em>the Supreme Court held \u201c[a]n active participant in a drug transaction has the intent needed to aid and abet a \u00a7 924(c) violation when he knows that one of his confederates will carry a gun\u201d. 134 S.Ct. at 1249. A \u00a7 924(c) accomplice defendant is required to have \u201cknowledge at a time [he] can do something with it\u2014 most notably, opt to walk away\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 1249-50. As the Court explained in <em>Rose-mond: </em>\u201c[I]f a defendant continues to participate in a crime after a gun was displayed or used by a confederate, the jury can permissibly infer from his failure to object or withdraw that he had such knowledge\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 1250 n. 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">As an initial matter, Rainwater\u2019s opening brief only challenges his \u00a7 924(c) conviction for count two, and does not discuss counts five, seven, nine, or 11; therefore, any challenges to those latter counts are waived. <em>See United States v. Jimenez, </em>509 F.3d 682, 693 n. 10 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">Regarding his conviction for count two, the trial evidence shows Rainwater\u2019s accomplice displayed a firearm at the outset of the robbery that forms the basis of that count. At that point, Rainwater, rather than withdrawing from the offense: hopped over the counter; armed himself with a bread knife;. and began to gather money. Further, the evidence does not establish Rainwater would have \u201cincrease[d] the risk of gun violence\u201d by aborting the robbery once the firearm was displayed. <em>See Rosemond, </em>134 S.Ct. at 1251.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">In the light of the foregoing, Rainwater fails to show <em>Rosemond </em>establishes he may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense for count two; therefore, he has not met the requirements of the savings clause. <em>See Reyes-Requena, </em>243 F.3d at 904. Accordingly, because it was not the sentencing court, the court properly concluded it did not have jurisdiction to treat Rainwater\u2019s petition as a \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>Solsona, </em>821 F.2d at 1132.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b521-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
