Regarding his appointed counsel (federal public defender), Brown contends the district court erred by: denying his requests for appointment of substitute counsel; and failing to conduct an adequate inquiry into the basis for those requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-20\">As an initial matter, the Government maintains Brown\u2019s unconditional guilty plea waived any non-jurisdictional defects, such as any error in the denial of his motions for the appointment of new counsel. Because we conclude Brown has not shown error, it is unnecessary to resolve this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-21\">\u201cUnless a Sixth Amendment violation is shown, whether to appoint a different lawyer for an indigent criminal defendant who expresses dissatisfaction with his court-appointed counsel is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Young, </em>482 F.2d 993, 995 (5th Cir.1973). Accordingly, our court reviews a refusal to appoint substitute counsel only for abuse of that discretion. <em>E.g., United States v. Simpson, </em>645 F.3d 300, 307 (5th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-22\">Brown\u2019s primary assertions were that his appointed counsel refused to move for his release on bond, and strongly encouraged him to plead guilty. He maintains the court did not conduct a meaningful inquiry into his allegations. Nevertheless, a review of the record shows the court\u2019s inquiry into Brown\u2019s complaints was sufficient to ascertain the nature of the alleged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>problems and to glean the relevant facts. <em>See United States v. Fields, </em>483 F.3d 313, 352 (5th Cir.2007) (stating a court must be adequately apprised of the nature of the dispute or conflict and its potential impact on counsel\u2019s representation).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\">Even assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>the court failed to conduct a proper inquiry as to any particular claim, \u201cthe record as a whole reflects that [Brown\u2019s] claim was insubstantial and that he received vigorous and able representation\u201d. <em>Young, </em>482 F.2d at 995-96. Moreover, Brown has not shown \u201ca conflict of interest, a complete breakdown in communication or an irreconcilable conflict which [led] to an apparently unjust\u201d result. <em>Id. </em>at 995.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b536-23\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
