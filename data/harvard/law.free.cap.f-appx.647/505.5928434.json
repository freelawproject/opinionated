Ann. \u00a7 14:70.1. The IJ determined that Afzal\u2019s conviction was an aggravated felony under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101 (a)(43)(M)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">We lack \u201cjurisdiction to review any final order of removal against an alien who is removable by reason of having committed\u201d an aggravated felony, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C), but we retain jurisdiction to decide the jurisdictional question of whether the charged crime is an aggravated felony, which we review de novo. <em>Rodriguez v. Holder, </em>705 F.3d 207, 210 (5th Cir.2013). \u201cAny alien who is convicted of an aggravated felony at any time after admission is deportable.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii). The definition of \u201caggravated felony\u201d includes \u201can offense that involves fraud or deceit in which the loss to the victim or victims exceeds $10,000.\u201d \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(M)(i); <em>see also Nijhawan v. Holder, </em>557 U.S. 29, 38, 129 S.Ct. 2294, 174 L.Ed.2d 22 (2009). Afzal does not dispute that his fraud conviction involved fraud or deceit. The issue presented is whether the BIA erred in determining that the offense involved a loss to the victim that was greater than $10,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">The amount of loss under \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(M)(i) \u201cis a factual matter to be determined from the record of conviction.\u201d <em>Arguelles-Olivares v. Mukasey, </em>526 F.3d 171, 177 (5th Cir.2008). We must decide \u201cwhether there was clear and convincing evidence that [Afzal\u2019s] prior conviction involved an amount of loss greater than $10,000 and whether the evidence establishing that the conviction involved such a loss was reasonable, substantial, and probative.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 178.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">The BIA did not err by concluding that the restitution amount of $96,000 set forth in the state court\u2019s restitution order provided clear and convincing evidence, in the absence of any contrary record evidence, to prove the amount of loss to the \"victim for purposes of \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(M)(i). <em>See </em>557 U.S. at 42-43, 129 S.Ct. 2294; <em>James v. Gonzales, </em>464 F.3d 505, 510-11 <em>&amp; </em>n. 31 (5th Cir.2006). Thus, the BIA properly determined that Afzal was removable as an aggravated felon.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">With respect to Afzal\u2019s argument that the IJ erred by denying his motion to continue, the denial of a continuance in a case involving the jurisdiction-stripping provision of \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C) \u2022 \u201cdoes not present a constitutional claim or issue of law that this court has jurisdiction to consider.\u201d <em>Ogunfwye v. Holder, </em>610 F.3d 303, 307 (5th Cir.2010). To the extent Afzal has raised a due process claim, <em>see Hadwani v. Gonzales, </em>445 F.3d 798, 800 (5th Cir.2006), he has not established that he suffered substantial prejudice. <em>See Anwar v. I.N.S., </em>116 F.3d 140, 144 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-9\">Finally, because the BIA correctly determined that Afzal was removable based on his aggravated felony conviction, he was ineligible for the discretionary relief of cancellation of removal. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(a)(3). Afzal does not challenge the BIA\u2019s determination that his fraud conviction was a crime involving moral turpitude rendering him ineligible for adjustment of status under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(a)(2) and 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I), and therefore he has abandoned that issue. <em>See Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 833 (5th Cir.2003). Because we have determined that Afzal was removable as an aggravated felon, we do not address the issue whether he was also rempvable under' \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(ii) for committing two or more crimes involving moral turpitude. We likewise do not the address the ex-pungement documents first furnished by Afzal on appeal. <em>See Ramchandani v. Gonzales, </em>434 F.3d 337, 341 n. 1 (5th Cir.2005). In any event, a vacated conviction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>remains valid for immigration purposes and meets the definition of conviction under \u00a7 1101(a)(48)(A). <em>See Renteria-Gonzalez v. I.N.S., </em>322 F.3d 804, 814 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">Because Afzal\u2019s fraud conviction was properly regarded by the BIA as an aggravated felony under \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(M)(i), we lack jurisdiction, and the petition for review is DISMISSED. <em>See James, </em>464 F.3d at 512.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b529-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cm.
