After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-12\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b939-13\">In 2014, Defendant pleaded guilty to conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute Schedule II controlled substances, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371, and traveling in interstate commerce with the intent to promote and carry on unlawful activity, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1952(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b939-15\">In anticipation of sentencing, the probation officer prepared a Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSR\u201d). The PSR assigned Defendant a base offense level of 30, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(5), because the underlying offense involved the equivalent of at least 876.76 kilograms of marijuana. Defendant received various enhancements and a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, which resulted in a total offense level of 33. Based on a total offense level of 33 and a criminal history category of I, Defendant\u2019s advisory guideline range was 135 to 168 months\u2019 imprisonment. However, because the statutory maximum for each count was five years\u2019 imprisonment, Defendant\u2019s guideline range became 120 months\u2019 imprisonment. The district court sentenced Defendant to a total of 120 months\u2019 imprisonment, comprised of 60 months on each count to be served consecutively.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-16\">In 2015, Defendant filed a counseled \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, asserting that he was eligible for a sentence reduction because Amendment 782 lowered his guideline range. The district court denied Defendant\u2019s motion, concluding that although Amendment 782 lowered Defendant\u2019s total offense level \u2014 resulting in an amended guideline range of 108 to 120 months\u2019 imprisonment \u2014 Defendant\u2019s original sentence was within the amended guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-17\">Defendant moved for reconsideration, requesting that the district court reconsider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors in light of his post-sentencing rehabilitative conduct and because he was not a threat to the community. The district court denied Defendant\u2019s motion, stating that it had \u201cagain carefully considered all factors in this case\u201d and determined that 120 months\u2019 imprisonment was an appropriate sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"916\">*916</page-number>Defendant now appeals arguing that the district court did not provide sufficient explanation of its reasons for denying his motion for reconsideration of its previous denial of his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion,</p>\n<p id=\"b940-4\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b940-5\">We review a district court\u2019s decision to deny a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Jules, </em>595 F.3d 1239, 1241 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b940-6\">Under \u00a7 \u20193582(c)(2), a district court may modify a term of imprisonment when the original sentencing range has been subsequently lowered as a result of an amendment to the Guidelines by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). To be eligible for a sentencing reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a defendant must identify an amendment to the Sentencing Guidelines that is listed in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(d). U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(1). Amendment 782 reduced the base offense level for most drug offenses by two levels. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 lB1.10(d); U.S.S.G. App. C, Amend. 782 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b940-7\">A district court must follow a two-step process in ruling on a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780 (11th Cir.2000). First, the district court must \u201cdetermin[e] a new base level by substituting the amended guideline range for the originally applied guideline range, and then us[e] that new base level to determine what ultimate sentence it would have imposed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>At this step, all other guideline application decisions made during the original sentencing remain the same. <em>Id. </em>Second, the district court must decide whether, in its discretion and in light of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to retain the original sentence or to resen-tence the defendant under the amended guideline range. <em>Id. </em>at 781.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-10\">Here, the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Defendant\u2019s motion for a sentence reduction. After the district court recalculated Defendant\u2019s guideline range based on Amendment 782 and determined that Defendant was eligible for a sentence reduction, it was required to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See Bravo, </em>203 F.3d at 780. The district court explicitly stated in its order denying Defendant\u2019s motion for a sentence reduction that it had taken \u201cinto account the policy statement set forth in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 and the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a),\u201d Thus, the record was sufficient to show that the district court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See United States v. Eggersdorf, </em>126 F.3d 1318, 1322 (11th Cir.1997) (concluding that although the district court did not explicitly mention each \u00a7 3553(a) factor, it sufficiently considered the factors because the parties\u2019 motions addressed them). Additionally, the district court stated in its. order denying Defendant\u2019s motion for reconsideration that it had \u201cagain carefully considered the factors in this case\u201d and determined that the sentence was appropriate. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b940-11\">To the extent Defendant argues that the only factor the district court should have considered was the lowered amended guideline range, this argument is without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"917\">*917</page-number>merit. The two-step analysis requires the district court to first calculate the amended guideline range, and then to consider whether a sentence reduction is appropriate in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See Bravo, </em>203 F.3d at 780. In short, it was within the district court\u2019s discretion to deny Defendant\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, especially given that the original sentence was within the Defendant\u2019s amended guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b940-8\">. The \u00a7 3553(a) factors include: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (3) the need for deterrence; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) the need to provide the defendant with needed education or vocational training or medical care; (6) the kinds of sentences available; (7) the Sentencing Guidelines range; (8) pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (9) the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities; and (10) the need to provide restitution to victims. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
