Guideline \u00a7 3Bl.l(c) does <em>not, </em>however, provide for a three-level enhancement. Instead, it states: \u201cIf the defendant was an organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor in any criminal activity other than described in (a) or (b), increase by 2 levels\u201d. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">On the other hand, \u00a7 3B 1.1(a) states: \u201cIf the defendant was an organizer or leader of a criminal activity that involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive, increase by 4 levels\u201d. \u00a7 3B 1.1(a). And, \u00a7 3B 1.1(b) provides: \u201cIf the defendant was a manager or supervisor (but not an organizer or leader) and the criminal activity involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive, increase by 3 levels\u201d. \u00a7 3B 1.1(b). In any event, Guerrero did not object to this discrepancy in district court; and, on appeal, did not contend the wrong subsection was applied until his reply brief. Therefore, such a challenge is waived. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>602 F.3d 346, 360-61 (5th Cir.2010). (Arguably, Guerrero could have been subject to the four-level enhancement under \u00a7 3B 1.1(a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">Instead, prior to sentencing, Guerrero objected to the PSR, and claimed he was not a leader or an organizer. At sentencing, the district court: adopted the PSR; applied the three-level enhancement, bringing Guerrero\u2019s total-offense level to 37; and sentenced Guerrero to, <em>inter alia, </em>235 months\u2019 imprisonment. In challenging that sentence, Guerrero asserts: the court found he was an organizer based on unreliable and inconsistent statements made by his co-conspirators; and, at most, he was a low-level operative subject to the direction of others in the conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">Although <em>post-Booker, </em>the Sentencing Guidelines are advisory only, and a properly preserved objection to an ultimate sentence is reviewed for reasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard, the district court must still properly calculate the advisory Guidelines-sentencing range for use in deciding on the sentence to impose. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). In that respect, for issues preserved in district court, its application of the Guidelines is reviewed <em>de novo; </em>its factual findings, only for clear error. <em>E.g., United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">A district court\u2019s determination that a defendant was an organizer or leader of criminal activity is a factual finding reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Rodriguez-Lopez, </em>756 F.3d 422, 434-35 (5th Cir.2014). \u201cA factual finding is not clearly erroneous if it is plausible in light of the record as a whole.\u201d <em>United States v, Zuniga, </em>720 F.3d 587, 590 (5th Cir.2013). Moreover, a PSR generally bears sufficient indicia of reliability to be considered for sentencing purposes. <em>Id. </em>at 591.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">The evidence in the PSR established: Guerrero planned and supervised a drug-transporting operation; he exercised decision-making authority by recruiting, directing, and paying his co-conspirators; and, the conspiracy involved more than five people. Accordingly, the court did not clearly err by finding Guerrero was an organizer of the criminal activity and enhancing his sentence on that basis. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3B1.1; \u00a7 3B1.1, cmt. n. 4; <em>United States v. Cantu-Ramirez, </em>669 F.3d 619, 629-30 (5th Cir.2012) (affirming a \u00a7 3Bl.l(a) enhancement).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b523-23\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
