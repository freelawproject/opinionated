Newman, Texas prisoner # 1892170, appeals the dismissal of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint as barred by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).

Newman has failed to make that showing. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b421-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cm.
