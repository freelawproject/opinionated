In his \u00a7 1983 complaint, Barker alleged that the defendants were deliberately indifferent to his serious medical needs after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>he informed them that he was having chest pains and difficulty breathing.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">We review the grant of a motion for summary judgment de novo. <em>Xtreme Lashes, LLC v. Xtended Beauty, Inc., </em>576 F.3d 221, 226 (5th Cir.2009). Summary judgment is warranted \u201cif the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.CivP. 56(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">The standard required to succeed on a deliberate-indifference claim is \u201cextremely high,\u201d and Johnson has not met it here in connection with his claim that Ruth Brou-wer ignored his sole complaints of chest pain and difficulty breathing. <em>See Domino v. Texas Dep\u2019t of Criminal Justice, </em>239 F.3d 752, 756- (5th Cir.2001). Even if Brouwer did not treat his complaints and instead told Barker to submit a medical request form in connection with these symptoms, there is no evidence that Barker had a history of a heart condition, that he had been diagnosed with a heart condition, or that he was on any medication for a heart condition. Just prior to Barker\u2019s complaints, Brouwer had taken Barker\u2019s vital signs, and they were normal. Thus, Barker has not shown deliberate indifference as to Brouwer.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">With respect to Barker\u2019s claims against Joyce Francis that she ignored his complaints of chest pains, the record reflects that she administered two EKGs, took his vitals, and reported her findings to a physician\u2019s assistant, who . d\u00e9termined the course of treatment. Barker has failed to show that she ignored his complaints, refused treatment, \u201cor engaged in any similar conduct that would clearly evince a wanton disregard for any serious medical needs.\u201d <em>Johnson v. Treen, </em>759 F.2d 1236, 1238 (5th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">Finally, Barker has not shown that Thomas Maciel, a nurse, was deliberately indifferent to his serious medical needs. During a morning visit, Maciel examined Barker, took his vital signs, manipulated the chest .wall, and determined that an EKG was not necessary. Maciel reported his findings to a doctor. At a visit later that afternoon, Barker reported that his chest pain had decreased. Maciel took Barker\u2019s vitals and reported his findings to a physician\u2019s assistant. Barker\u2019s complaint that Maciel should have performed additional testing or treatment amounts to a disagreement with medical treatment, which does not constitute a constitutional violation. <em>See Estelle v. Gamble, </em>429 U.S. 97, 104-05, 97 S.Ct. 285, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976); <em>see also Norton v. Dimazana, </em>122 F.3d 286, 292 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-9\">Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Barker, defendants were entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ,P. 56(a). Barker\u2019s motion for the appointment of appellate counsel is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-10\">AFFIRMED; MOTION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b419-27\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
