Ceja-Lua argues: that in denying his motions to reopen and for' reconsideration, the BIA failed to properly consider the evidence that he satisfied the \u00a7 1229b(b)(l)(D) requirement that his qualifying relatives would suffer exceptional and extremely unusual hardship if he were removed; that the-BIA\u2019s decisions implicate 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(a) of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), which directs a reviewing court to set aside agency action found to be arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or not in accordance with the law; and that the BIA\u2019s decision denying reconsideration lacked sufficient analysis and was thus, procedurally inadequate. The Government asserts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>that this court lacks jurisdiction to review Ceja-Lua\u2019s petition for review.'</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">This court reviews its subject matter jurisdiction de novo. <em>Garcia-Melendez v. Ashcroft, </em>351 F.3d 657, 660 (5th Cir.2003). Under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)\u00ae, the BIA\u2019s denial of discretionary relief in the form of cancellation of removal under \u00a7 1229b(b)(l) is excluded from judicial review. <em>See Kucana v. Holder, </em>558 U.S. 233, 246-48, 130 S.Ct. 827, 175 L.Ed.2d 694 (2010). Contrary to Ceja-Lua\u2019s assertions, the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Mata v. Lynch, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 135 S.Ct. 2150, 2154-56, 192 L.Ed.2d 225 (2015), invalidates neither the \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)\u00ae exceptions acknowledged in <em>Kucana, </em>558 U.S. at 246-48, 130 S.Ct. 827, nor this court\u2019s jurisprudence applying \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)\u00ae to bar judicial review over challenges to the denial of cancellation of removal. <em>See Sung v. Keisler, </em>505 F.3d 372, 377 (5th Cir.2007). This court lacks jurisdiction over such challenges whether the petitioner is appealing from a final order of removal or from the denial of a motion to reopen. <em>See Assaad v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 471, 474 (5th Cir.2004). Judicial review is not precluded, however, to the extent that the petition for review raises constitutional claims or questions of law. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D); <em>Garcia-Maldonado v. Gonzales, </em>491 F.3d 284, 287 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">Ceja-Lua\u2019s argument that the BIA failed to properly consider the evidence that his qualifying relatives would suffer the requisite hardship if he were removed constitutes a substantive challenge to the BIA\u2019s hardship determination, which is a factual question that falls squarely within the jurisdictional bar of \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B). <em>See Sattani v. Holder, </em>749 F.3d 368, 372 (5th Cir.2014). This result is not altered by Ceja-Lua\u2019s characterization, as questions of law, his contentions that the BIA applied an improper legal standard and failed to follow precedent in making its hardship determination. The BIA here applied the appropriate legal standard by imposing on Ceja-Lua the heavy burden of proving that if his removal proceedings were reopened, the new evidence would likely alter the outcome of his application for cancellation of removal by establishing exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to his qualifying relatives. <em>See Matter of Coelho, </em>20 I. &amp; N. Dec. 464, 472-73 (BIA 1992); \u00a7 1229b(b)(l)(D). A petitioner may not secure jurisdiction in this court by simply framing as a legal issue his challenge to the BIA\u2019s evaluation of the evidence in order to cloak his request for review of a discretionary decision. <em>See Falek v. Gonzales, </em>475 F.3d 285, 289 &amp; n. 2 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-12\">By asserting that the BIA violated \u00a7 706(2)(A) of the APA by failing to meaningfully. and rationally consider the new evidence and arguments presented in his motions to reopen and reconsider, Ceja-Lua has raised a legal question over which this court has jurisdiction under \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D). <em>See Sealed Petitioner v. Sealed Respondent, </em>567 Fed.Appx. 231, 235 (5th Cir.2014).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, Ceja-Lua\u2019s APA claim will not be considered, as it was raised for the first time in his reply brief. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 225 (5th Cir.1993). In any event, \u00a7 706(2)(A) does not apply to the BIA\u2019s individual adjudications in immigration proceedings. <em>Sealed Petitioner, </em>567 Fed.Appx. at 238; <em>see Ardestani v. INS, </em>502 U.S. 129, 133-34, 112 S.Ct. 515, 116 L.Ed.2d 496 (1991); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number><em>Rivera-Cruz v. INS, </em>948 F.2d 962, 967 n. 5 (6th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">It is unclear whether Ceja-Lua\u2019s challenge to the procedural adequacy of the BIA\u2019s order denying his motion for reconsideration is a legal question over which this court has jurisdiction under \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D). Even assuming this court has jurisdiction, however, Ceja-Lua\u2019s claim lacks merit. This court will review a BIA decision denying relief from removal \u201cprocedurally to ensure that the complaining alien has received full and fair consideration of all circumstances that give rise to his or her claims.\u201d <em>Abdel-Masieh v. INS, </em>73 F.3d 579, 581, 585 (5th Cir.1996) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Since a motion for reconsideration \u201curges an adjudicative body to reevaluate the record evidence only,\u201d <em>Zhao v. Gonzales, </em>404 F.3d 295, 301 (5th Cir.2005), the extent of explanation required in a legally sufficient order denying such a motion is necessarily less than in an order denying the underlying motion to reopen. By referencing its lengthier decision denying Ceja-Lua\u2019s motion to reopen, the BIA\u2019s brief decision denying reconsideration effectively \u201cannounce[d] its decision in terms sufficient to enable a reviewing court to perceive that it ha[d] heard and thought and not merely reacted.\u201d <em>See Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 903, 908 (5th Cir.2002) (quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART, DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b533-15\"> Pursuant,to 5th Cir.
