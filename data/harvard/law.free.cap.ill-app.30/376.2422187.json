While his obligation might be secondary as to the person to pay, yet, as to the fact of payment, there was nothing secondary about it. The liability of appellee to pay the debt evidenced by the note was a primary liability. Dickerson v. Derrickson, 39 Ill. 574, 577; Heaton v. Hulbert, 3 Scam. 489, 490; Voltz v.

Heaton v. Hulbert, 3 Scam. 491; Rich v. Hathaway, 18 Scam. 549; Hance v. Miller, 21 Ill. 636; Dickerson v. Derrickson, 39 Ill. 576; Croskey v. Skinner, 44 Ill. 322; Harwood v. Kiersted, 20 Ill. 373; Sea v. Glover, 1 Ill. App. 338, 339; Clark v. Morgan, 13 Ill. 597.</p><p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b374-5\" pgmap=\"374\">The cause of action that arises upon breach of a contract of guaranty is separate and distinct from the cause of action that exists against the principal debtor. Dickerson v. Derrickson, 39 Ill. 577; Sea v. Glover, 1 Ill. App. 338, 339; Clark v. Morgan, 13 Ill. App. 597; Pool v. Roberts, 19 Ill. App. 438.</p><p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b374-6\" pgmap=\"374\">The liability of the guarantor depends entirely upon the terms of his agreement, which are strictly construed : \u201c A guarantor is not liable beyond the express terms of his undertaking.\u201d Hance v. Miller, 21 Ill. 636; Newlan v. Harrington, 24 Ill. 207; Croskey v. Skinner, 44 Ill. 322.</p><p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b374-8\" pgmap=\"374\">The agreement in the case at bar was to pay costs, etc., paid or incurred in collecting the note ; the only suit- brought was on the guaranty; and the only costs and attorney\u2019s fees that were paid and incurred were in this action on the guaranty. The liability of the maker, Newell, on the note, and that of Brown on the guaranty, were as separate and distinct as their contracts. To enforce the former, suit should be brought on the note; to enforce the latter, on the guaranty. An agreement to pay attorney\u2019s fees incurred in the one suit does not include attorney\u2019s fees incurred in the other suit.</p> <opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b374-9\" pgmap=\"374\">Gary, J.</author> <p id=\"AZb\" pgmap=\"374\">The appellant sued the appellee upon a guaranty, as follows :</p> <blockquote id=\"b374-10\" pgmap=\"374\">\u201cFor value received I hereby guarantee the pajunent of the within note at maturity, or at any time thereafter, with interest at ten per cent, per annum until paid, and agree to pay all costs and expenses paid or incurred in collecting the same, including attorney\u2019s fees.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b374-11\" pgmap=\"374\">\u201c J. B. Beown.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b374-12\" pgmap=\"374\">And the note was :</p> <blockquote id=\"b374-13\" pgmap=\"374\">\u201cChicago, III., July 1, 1876.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b374-14\" pgmap=\"374\">\u201c One day after date I promise to pay to the order of H. G. Abbott two thousand dollars, with interest at the rate of ten per cent, per annum, at First National Bank of Chicago, value received.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b374-15\" pgmap=\"374\">\u201cBjek B. Newell.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b375-4\" pgmap=\"375\">That note was never collected, though before any suit was commenced on this guaranty the appellant had incurred expense in endeavoring, or watching an opportunity, to collect it.</p> <p id=\"b375-5\" pgmap=\"375\">July 3, 1882, appellant sued appellee upon this guaranty, prosecuted the case through the Circuit, this and the Supreme Courts, and at last got the principal and interest of the note itself, presumably with the taxable costs. His claim now is that the guaranty requires the appellee to pay, in this suit, the expenses both of the unsuccessful efforts to collect the note and the successful suit upon the guaranty. As to those first named expenses, if they were a proper charge against the appellee upon the guaranty, for which there is hardly a plausible pretext, they should have been included in the former suit. All the claim the appellant then had upon the guaranty constituted but one cause of action, and could not be split up. Clayes v. White, 83 Ill. 540; Nickerson v. Rockwell, 90 Ill. 460.</p> <p id=\"b375-6\" pgmap=\"375\">As to the expenses of prosecuting the former suit upon this guaranty, it is only by a forced and unnatural construction that they can be held to be within the guaranty. The antecedent of the word \u201c same \u201d in the guaranty is the phrase \u201cthe within note,\u201d so that the guaranty has the same meaning as if those words were inserted in place of the word \u201c same,\u201d making the reading, \u201c agree to pay all costs and expenses paid or incurred in collecting the within note.\u201d The guaranty and the note are separate contracts, and though the payment of either would, as to the holder, extinguish his claim upon the other, this consequence has no effect upon their separate identity. \u201cA surety can only be charged where the case is brought within the very terms of his contract.\u201d National Bank v. Diefendorf, 90 Ill. 396; Brandt on Sur. &amp; Guar., Sec. 79 et seq.</p> <p id=\"b375-7\" pgmap=\"375\">\u201c The liability of the guarantor depends entirely on the terms of the contract of guaranty.\u201d Croskey v. Skinner, 44 Ill. 321. And a written guaranty is governed by the general rule that a contract in writing can not be varied by parol evidence. Abrams v. Pomeroy, 13 Ill. 133.</p> <p id=\"b376-4\" pgmap=\"376\">\u2022 The cases cited from the reports of other States, holding that a guarantor of a note is a joint maker, whatever may he their application to this case, are not in accordance with the settled rule here. Clark v. Morgan, 13 Ill. App. 597.</p> <p id=\"b376-5\" pgmap=\"376\">It is true that the ultimate effect of the guaranty was an undertaking that the debt should be paid, but the form of that undertaking is, that the maker of the note would pay it. The contract is elliptical. The words \u201c by the maker thereof \u201d are implied, as if written in after the word \u201cnote,\u201d and the expenses assumed are such as might be incurred in compelling him to perform his contract contained in the note itself.</p> <p id=\"b376-6\" pgmap=\"376\">The Circuit Court was right in so holding, and the judgment is affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b376-7\" pgmap=\"376\">Judgment affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
