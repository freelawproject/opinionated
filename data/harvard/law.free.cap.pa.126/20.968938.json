J., charged the jury and answered the points presented as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b48-5\">By his will the testator gave his executor power to sell his real estate, and the effect of this grant of power was, to vest in the executor the right to maintain ejectment for any lands belonging to the estate of Widmer, and under the law the present plaintiff is invested with all the powers granted to the executor under the will. Therefore, it being admitted that the land in controversy belonged to John Widmer at the time of his death, the plaintiff, as the representative of the estate of Widmer, will be entitled to your verdict, unless the defendants have shown a good title acquired since the death of Widmer, as against the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b48-6\">********</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b48-7\">It is unfortunate for all parties that a competent lawyer was not consulted at the time the sales and deeds were made. He would, undoubtedly, have advised that the widow join in' the deeds, or that the executor should apply to the Orphans\u2019 Court for an order of sale. This, however, was not done, and the question of the widow\u2019s assent must now be determined by the jury under the evidence. The burden rests upon the defendants to show by clear, certain, satisfactory and indubitable evidence that the widow, before the sales were made, gave her full consent that the executor should sell these lots for the payment of the debts of the testator. Land is usually conveyed by writing, for the reason that being of so permanent a nature, the law, in its wisdom, requires that there shall be some deliberate act done, as evidence of sale and purchase, and that there may be some public record, made of the transfer of title and possession; but, as [in the case of a power under a will to sell real estate, after the death of a life tenant, the law permits the consent of the life tenant to a sale to be in parol, or merely verbal,]2 yet it holds the very strict rule I have just stated as to the certainty and clearness of the evidence necessary to prove such consent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b48-8\">The defendants allege that the lands of the testator outside of what is called the homestead, were not sufficient to pay his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>debts, and that upon consultation between the executor and the widow they concluded to sell the lots in controversy, off the homestead, and leave the house and a lot with it for the widow during life. Now, if the evidence satisfies you beyond any reasonable doubt that such was the fact; that the executor and the widow, believing it was necessary to sell these lots to pay the debts, and she freely gave her consent to such sale; and in pursuance of such consent and understanding, these lots were sold, then we say to you your verdict should be for the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b49-5\">* * * * * * *</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b49-6\">The plaintiff requests the court to charge [inter alia] :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b49-7\">2.

An executor can sell only by virtue of a power given by the will, or in the absence of such power, by order of the Orphans\u2019 Court. In making a sale under the will, the power must be strictly pursued; the sale can be made only at the time or on the contingency appointed, and for the purpose directed by the testator: Neel v. Beach, 92 Pa. 226; Sweigart v. Frey, 8 S. &amp; R. 299; Hay v. Mayer, 8 W. 203; Loomis v. McClintock, 10 W. 274. In the present case, the power of the executor, under the will, was limited to a sale for the purpose of making distribution. A direction to distribute, without an express power of sale, gives an executor no power to sell either for the payment of debts or for distribution: Clark v. Riddle, 11 S. &amp; R. 311. There is no question that the land was sold for the payment of debts. The personal estate was the primary fund for that purpose : Risk\u2019s App., 110 Pa. 171; Walker\u2019s Est., 3 R. 229. A valid sale of the real estate for the payment of debts, must have been made under authority, either from the will or from the Orphans\u2019 Court, and there was no authority from either.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b51-5\">2. The rule laid down in the cases first cited, has been modified only to the extent of holding that a sale may be made by the executors, during the lifetime of the widow, when she actually joins in the deed : Gast v. Porter, 13 Pa. 533; Styer v. Freas, 15 Pa. 342. In both these cases, the principle that a power to sell cannot be executed in advance of the contingency on which it is to take place, is affirmed; and this principle is simply so far qualified as to permit an earlier sale, with the consent of the party for whose benefit the time has been postponed in the instrument granting the power, when this consent is given by deed. In Styer v. Freas, the case was put partly on the ground that there was nothing to restrain the widow from parting with her estate by a conveyance. In Gast v. Porter, there was a parol assent by the distributees, in addition to the widow\u2019s deed. In Styer v. Freas, the only parties interested, besides the widow, were the minor heirs of her deceased daughter; and as to them a sale after their mother\u2019s death was good, since the will directed a sale after her death, though it contemplated that she would outlive the widow, and gave her the estate for life after the widow\u2019s death.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b51-6\">3. So far as the case rests on the right of the widow to con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>vey her estate, it is within the statute of frauds. The widow\u2019s interest was a freehold estate. At, common law, the creation or transfer of any freehold, whether of inheritance or not, required livery of seisin: 2 Bl. Com. 120. Under our recording acts, a deed duly recorded is equivalent to livery of seisin. But it has never been enacted or decided that a life estate may be conveyed or released except in the manner required to pass the fee: Kling v. Hummer, 2 P. &amp; W. 349; Hart v. Carroll, 85 Pa. 508. Moreover neither the alleged consent of the widow, nor the parol sale at auction by the executor, passed any interest in the land to the purchaser: Kurtz v. Cummings, 24 Pa. 37. Nothing vested in them until delivery of the deeds. Between the time of the parol sale and the delivery of the deeds, the widow could have recalled her assent, had she given it in the manner testified to. It does not appear that she assented to the delivery of the deeds, and her omission to join in their execution indicates that her assent was lacking. For half a century, at least, the courts have regretted the relaxation of the statute of frauds: Moore v. Small, 19 Pa. 466; Postlethwait v. Frease, 31 Pa. 474; Poorman v. Kilgore, 26 Pa. 365; Cox v. Cox, 26 Pa. 375.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b52-5\"><em>Mr. Gharlton </em>Burnett, for the defendants in error:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b52-6\">1. By the power to sell, the estate under our acts of assembly was vested in the executor, subject to the life estate of the widow. Unquestionably the postponement of the sale was made solely for the benefit of the widow, and the testator could not have intended that the part of his estate should not be sold until her death, if the widow consented to the sale and it would inure to her benefit. That consent obtained, the executor had the power to sell, either for the payment of debts or for distribution. True, there has been a departure from the earlier cases: Smith v. Folwell, 1 Binn. 546, and Sweigart v. Frey, 8 S. &amp; R. 299, holding that \u201c a devise to executors to sell on a contingency, cannot be executed till the contingency happens; \u201d but the counsel misconstrues the later cases, Gast v. Porter, 13 Pa. 532, and Styer v. Freas, 15 Pa. 342. In both these cases, the court referred to the fact that the life-tenant had joined in a deed of conveyance, but did not decide that the consent of the life-tenant must be given by deed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b53-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>2. All doubt, however, on this subject is removed by Brown\u2019s App., 27 Pa. 62, wherein it was said: \u201c If the postponement of the sale was for her benefit, it is said to be text law that she may waive it by assenting to the sale before the period designated by the will: Gast v. Porter, 13 Pa. 533. If she may waive it in one way, she may certainly waive it by any other means equally effective in closing her mouth against subsequent objections.\u201d The cases cited as to the force of the statute of frauds have no application. The case in hand was simply the waiver of a right on the part of the widow, and under the facts found from the evidence, the widow would have been estopped from challenging the validity of the sale: Maple v. Kussart, 53 Pa. 348; Chapman v. Chapman, 59 Pa. 214; Miller\u2019s App., 84 Pa. 391; Woodward v. Tudor, 81* Pa. 382; Putnam v. Tyler, 117 Pa. 570.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b53-5\">Opinion,</p>\n<author id=\"AQ\">Mu. Justice Mitchell :</author>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">John Widmer devised his homestead to his widow for life, and directed that upon her decease his executor should sell the same and pay over the proceeds to certain of his children. The executor sold during the lifetime of the widow, but with her consent. It appeared at the trial that the rest of the estate was not sufficient to pay the testator\u2019s debts, and that the executor thought the best thing to do was to sell part of the homestead, so as to retain the dwelling-house for the widow, and in this she concurred. It is not, however, contended that the sale, without a decree from the Orphans\u2019 Court, can. be sustained upon the power of the executor to pay debts, but upon the widow\u2019s consent. As rightly ruled by the learned judge, the question whether the debts could have been met in some other way was immaterial, unless the widow\u2019s consent was obtained by fraud or misrepresentation, of which there was no evidence. The proof of the widow\u2019s consent was satisfactory to the jury, even under the strict standard laid down by the judge, that it must be \u201c clear, certain, satisfactory, and indubitable,\u201d but it was all in parol, and we have thus the single question presented whether under such circumstances consent must be evidenced by writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">The case does not call in question at all the- settled rules that powers must be strictly pursued, and that a power to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>exercised upon a given event cannot be properly executed before the happening of that event. But the exception is equally well settled that where a power is complete, but its exercise is postponed for the benefit of a particular person, the consent of that person will be equivalent to the happening of the stipulated contingency.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">The devise to Mrs. Widmer was of \u201c the whole of my double dwelling-house, being the same double house, the half of which we do occupy at the present time.....for the use and benefit of my said wife during her life; and from and after her decease I order that my executor shall sell the same,\u201d etc. The testator further directed the immediate sale by his executor, of all his personal estate, and all his other real estate, excepting only the homestead. It is thus beyond question that the power to sell was ample, and the postponement of its exercise was solely for the benefit of the widow, and that the interest of the only other parties who had any interest in the matter, the children-who would be entitled to the proceeds, was to have the sale at once.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-8\">Gast v. Porter, 13 Pa. 533, was very similar to the present case. The devise was to the widow for life, with a direction to the surviving executors to sell upon her death; the executors sold during her life; and the question of the validity of the sale arose upon ejectment by the administrator cum testamento annexo; the only difference being that the widow was one of the executors, and as such joined in the deed. This circumstance, however, was not adverted to by the court as a ground of the decision. All that was said upon it was, \u201c an immediate sale and distribution was for the interest of all except the widow, who by joining in the deed assented to the sale.\u201d The decision was put by Rogers, J., entirely on the intention of the testator, and \u201c as this provision in the will was intended for her (the widow\u2019s) benefit, it is text law that she had a right to waive it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b54-9\">This case was followed by Styer v. Freas, 15 Pa. 339, where again the widow had joined in the deed, but again the decision was put exclusively on the intention of the testator. \u201c Where the time is postponed,\u201d says Gibson, C. J., \u201c for the protection of a particular person, it may be hastened by the assent of that person, as it was in Gast v. Porter; but where it has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>postponed with a view to a probable rise in value, the persons entitle^ to the benefit of the chance, may insist on having it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">In neither of these cases was the form of the widow\u2019s consent discussed, but in Brown\u2019s Appeal, 27 Pa. 62, where there was a similar devise to the widow for life, and direction to the executor to sell at her decease, the widow elected to take under the intestate law, and it was held that the executor took the estate with immediate power to sell. The intention of tbe testator was again held to be the guide. \u201c It is manifest,\u201d says C. J. Lewis, \u201c that the sale was postponed for the benefit of the widow .... and it is said to be text law that she may waive it by assenting to the sale before the period designated in the will: Gast v. Porter, 13 Pa. 533. If she may waive it in one way, she may certainly waive it by any other means equally effective in closing her mouth against subsequent objections. What can be a more decisive waiver than renouncing all benefit under the will ? The widow did this in open court, in pursuance of a citation which required her to make her election,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">These decisions rule the present ease, and we do not see any compulsion to depart from them. The idea that the widow\u2019s consent must be in writing undoubtedly arose from viewing the sale as a conveyance of her freehold estate.
