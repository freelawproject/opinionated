The defendant pleaded, not guilty.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b116-13\">At the trial on May 16, 1888, the plaintiff put in evidence the record of a judgment recovered by himself against John L.

This deed was acknowledged on April 7, 1882, and was duly recorded on May 6, 1885. The defendant then rested.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b117-5\">The court, Woodward, J., for the reason that some two years before the judgment was entered against John L. Brown upon which the plaintiff claimed title, the same person, John L. Brown, had sold and conveyed to John Wyllis all his right, title and interest to the premises in dispute; and, furthermore, for the reason that there was no evidence that John L. Brown was in possession of the premises in question at the time of the sheriff\u2019s sale under which the plaintiff claimed title, instructed the jury to return a verdict in favor of the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b117-6\">The jury returned a verdict in favor of the defendant as directed. Thereupon the plaintiff filed a motion for a new trial, and\u00f3n September 17,1888, a rule therefor was discharged in the following opinion, Woodward, J.:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b117-7\">At the trial of this ejectment the plaintiff, having shown his writ and identified the premises, then put in evidence the judgment, the writ of fieri facias showing the levy and condemnation, the venditioni exponas with the sheriff\u2019s return of the sale to S. D. Yost, the plaintiff, in pursuance of the sale, dated October 8,1885. The plaintiff was then called as a witness to show that the premises described in Ms deed were tbe same as those in the writ. And then the plaintiff rested his ease. The defence then offered in evidence a deed from John L. Brown, the defendant, and wife, to John Wyllis, dated April 7, 1882, for the same land described in the ejectment. This deed was acknowledged on the day of its date before a justice of the peace, and was recorded on May 6, 1885. The defence then rested, and, no rebutting evidence having been offered by the plaintiff, the counsel for defendant and plaintiff, respectively, submitted points in writing asking for binding instructions to the jury, which were given in favor of the defendant. The plaintiff alleges that tiie court erred in giving these instructions, and lienee the present motion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b117-8\">The exact question now before ns, therefore, is this: Was or was not the plaintiff bound to show that, at the time of the levy and sale by tbe sheriff, the defendant was in possession <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>of the land; or, was his case sufficiently established by proof of the judgment, execution, and sheriff\u2019s sale, followed by the sheriff\u2019s deed of October 8,1885 ? The plaintiff\u2019s counsel have referred us to the following cases as decisive of this question, and as showing conclusively that we were wrong in our instructions to the jury: Young v. Algeo, 3 W. 223; Snavely v. Wagner, 3 Pa. 275; Wetherill v. Curry, 2 Phila. 98. We proceed, therefore, to examine these cases.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b118-5\">In Young v. Algeo, 3 W. 223, Mr. Justice Kekt\u00edtedy says: \u201c Although the rule seems to be general that the defendant in the execution and all those coming into possession under him are estopped by the judgment from disputing the plaintiff\u2019s right of possession (quoting Eisenhart v. Slaymaker, 14 S. &amp; R. 153), yet, upon the ground of estoppel, it must be considered subject to some qualifications.\u201d And he illustrates his meaning by the case of a defendant in an execution, who had been a tenant of the premises in question at the time of the sheriff\u2019s sale, and who remained in possession afterwards, without proceedings against him by the purchaser at the sheriff\u2019s sale, until his lease had expired and a new one had been made. There would be no estoppel in such a case, for the reason that, an interest having passed to the purchaser at the sheriff\u2019s sale, the tenant had a right to show what that interest really was, and that it had expired by its own limitation, and that he is now in possession under a right acquired since, by a subsequent contract, which the purchaser at sheriff\u2019s sale cannot be presumed to have bought of paid for. In the same opinion Judge Keknedy, in discussing another branch of the case, employs the following language: \u201c The operation of law is clearly to put the purchaser in the shoes of the defendant in the execution at the time of the sale. Hence, if the defendant in the execution be in the possession of the property sold, the purchaser is entitled to take his place, and, whether the defendant has a right to it or not, he is estopped from saying afterwards that he had no right at the time of sale, and, therefore, none passed by it.\u201d The case of Snavely v. Wagner, 3 Pa. 275, turned on the point that the defendant in the execution held the possession, not in his own right, but in that of his wife; in other words, that he had only a life estate, which was not the subject of a sale by the sheriff. But in noticing the question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>which we are now considering, Mr. Justice Rogers stated the rule of the law as follows : \u201c It is in general true that where a defendant in a judgment is in possession at the time of the levy and sale, he cannot make any defence against the purchaser at a sheriff\u2019s sale.\u201d In Wetherill v. Curry, 2 Phila. 98, the facts were that Curry, the defendant in the original judgment, was in possession of the land at the time of the levy and sale by the sheriff, and that Hannah Raymon'd had been admitted as landlord to defend, upon the allegation that Curry was her tenant. Judge Sharswood states the law as follows: \u201c When the sheriff sells the land of a defendant in a judgment who is in possession, he cannot make any defence against the purchaser, as the latter acquires a right to the defendant\u2019s possession at least, which will support ejectment against him.\u201d And for this he quotes as authority Snavely v. Wagner, 8 Pa. 275, already referred to in this opinion. And Mr. Brightly, in his digest, after quoting all the Pennsylvania cases up to that time on the subject, states the rule of the law to be this: \u201c If the debtor were in possession at the time of sale, the purchaser is entitled to recover the possession as against him and those claiming under him: \u201d See Brightly\u2019s Digest, 1115. The case of Dunlap v. Cook, 18 Pa. 454, is not applicable to the case before us, for the reason that the defence was not the lack of possession at the time of levy, but that the defendant, as whose property the premises were sold, proposed to set up title under a lease taken by him from a third person after the judgment was obtained and execution levied upon the land in dispute. Nor are we able to agree with the learned counsel for the plaiixtiff as to the effect, in the present case, of those adjudications whereixi it is held, as iix Green v. Watrous, 17 S. &amp;. R. 398, that, \u201cas betweexi the purchaser and the defendants in the action, the purchaser can recover on the strength of the sale and sheriff\u2019s deed, without showing other title, nor can the defendant show title in another.\u201d For first, it was not shown, as matter of fact, by the evidence in that case, that the defendaxxt was iix possession at the time of levy and sale, and secondly, in the present case, the \u201c title in another\u201d was shown by the defendant, without objection oxx the part of the plaintiff, at the time of the trial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b119-5\">We do not consider it necessary to say anything more on this branch of the case. It would seem, under the authorities, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>to be entirely clear that the failure of the plaintiff to prove the defendant in possession of the premises at the time of the sheriff\u2019s levy and sale, compelled the court to hold that a title prima facie had not been shown. And when the defendant was allowed, without objection, to prove an actual conveyance of the land by the defendant to a third party, more than three years before the sale by the sheriff, the duty of the court to grant a request for a compulsory nonsuit, or to give to the jury binding instructions in favor of the defendant, seemed to us to be plain and imperative; for the doctrine of the law is, that, in the absence of proof to the contrary, the legal title to land draws to it the possession of the land as a presumption, for the possession and the right of possession are presumed to be in him who owns the fee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b120-5\">The motion for a new trial is denied.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b120-6\">Judgment having been entered in favor of the defendant, the plaintiff took this writ, assigning the instruction of the court to find for the defendant as error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b120-7\"><em>Mr. William S.

It is doubtless true that if the defendant had been in possession at the time of the sheriff\u2019s sale, he would be obliged to yield that possession <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>to the sheriff's vendee. There was, however, no evidence of such possession except what appears by the record, and that furnishes presumptions merely. The return to the writ of ejectment shows the defendant was in possession at the time of the service of said, writ, which was about two months after the sheriff\u2019s sale. On the other hand, the defendant appears to have sold and conveyed the property to John Wyllis, some two years before the judgment in question was entered against him. The possession must be presumed to have accompanied the deed. The act of May 28, 1715, 1 Sm. L. 95, provides that \u201c All deeds and conveyances made or to be made, and proved or acknowledged, and recorded as aforesaid,.....shall be of the same force and effect here, for the giving possession and seisin, and making good the title and assurance of the said lands, tenements and hereditaments, as deeds of feoffment, with livery and seisin, or deeds enrolled, in any of the king\u2019s courts of record at Westminster, are or shall be in the kingdom of Great Britain.\u201d As before observed, we have nothing but presumptions in regard to the possession at the time of the sheriff\u2019s sale, and the stronger presumption is with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
