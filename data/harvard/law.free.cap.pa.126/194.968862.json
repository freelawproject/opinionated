The place where they wore written, the different kind of ink used, and the words themselves, indicate nothing more than a willingness on the part of the bank to grant a renewal if it should be asked for. The memorandum was therefore no part of the note, and formed no part of the contract: Byles on Bills, 4th Am. ed., 75*; Chitty on Bills, 162-3 ; 1 Randolph on Com. Paper, \u00a7 170; Overton v. Tyler, 3 Pa. 346; Tuckerman v. Hartwell, 3 Me. 147; Brill v. Crick, 1 Gale 441; Hodges v. Shules, 22 N.

If, however, the memorandum on the margin was a part of the note and such a part of it as to destroy its negotiability, there was yet a distinct offer made by the plaintiff to prove an agreement to renew by all the parties to the instrument at the time it was discounted at the bank. It was not an offer to prove anything contrary to the writing itself, but to prove that the defendant, with the other parties, agreed to renew the note if not paid at maturity. And if his signature on the back of the contract was not enough to bind him by its terms, then this offer was necessary; otherwise not. The offer was not objectionable under the statute of frauds: Uhler v. Farmers N. Bank, 64 Pa. 406; Malone v. Keener, 44 Pa. 107; Innes v. Munro, 1 Exch. 473.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b220-6\"><em>Mr. Edward </em>Overton, Jh, (with him <em>Mr. Elhanan </em>Smith) for the defendant in error:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b220-7\">1. Prima facie, the memorandum is contemporaneous with the instrument: Randolph on Com. Paper, \u00a7 190; Fletcher v. Blodgett, 16 Vt. 26. If such memorandum be made at or before the execution of the instrument, it is generally held to be a part' of it, unless merely placed on the paper by way of ear-mark: Byles on Bills, 71*; Randolph on Com. Paper, \u00a7 191; Chitty on Bills, \u00a7 163; Daniels on Neg. Inst. \u00a7 159. A memorandum on the note, to control it, would be incorporated with it and destroy its negotiability: Overton v. Tyler, 3 Pa. 346; Zimmerman v. Rote, 75 Pa. 188. Instances: Franklin Sav. Inst. v. Read, 125 Mass. 365; McCalla v. McCalla, 48 Ga. 503; Haywood v. Perrin, 10 Pick. 228; Krouskop v. Shontz, 51 Wis. 204 (37 Am. Rep. 817).</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b220-8\">2. The note in suit is so qualified by the memorandum on it as to deprive it of the essential qualities of commercial paper, \u2022for it did not remain a promise for the payment of money absolutely at a specified time and at all events: Way v. Smith, 111 Mass. 523; Sultz v. Silva, 119 Mass. 137; Hubbard v. Mosely, 11 Gray 170; Ernst v. Steckman, 74 Pa. 13; Overton v. Tyler, 3 Pa. 346; Woods v. North, 84 Pa. 407. We do not understand the offer covered by the second assignment of error, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>The first part of it was to show that the defendant refused to* indorse a new note; the latter, that he was a party to the original agreement. No such cause of action was set forth in the statement of claim, and if it had been, it would not have availed: Wright v. Hart, 44 Pa. 454; Gray v. Donahoe, 4 W. 400.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b221-4\">Opinion,</p>\n<author id=\"AYq\">Mr. Justice Green:</author>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">This is an action against the indorser of a promissory note. He is sued upon his contract of indorsement and not upon any other or independent special contract in relation to that indorsement. His liability therefore in the present action must be the technical liability of an indorser or the suit must fail. The note itself, without the written memorandum which appears upon its face, is a complete and perfect obligation of a negotiable character; and if the written memorandum were not there, we know of no reason why there should not be a recovery against the defendant as a mere indorser. But the memorandum is there; it is not alleged nor offered to be proved that it is there without authority, and if it has a controlling effect apon the note, it must be treated as a part of it. Its meaning is entirely plain.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">The words, written across the end of the note, and on the lace of it, in immediate proximity to the w'ords of the note, are, \u201cThis note is given for advancements, and it is the understanding it will be renewed at maturity.\u201d The statement that it is given for advancements does not affect the certainty of the note and it could easily be regarded as a mere memorandum, not changing the contract and therefore not material. But the remainder of the writing is an agreement that the note will be renewed at maturity. As the bank is the holder and discounted the note when it was given, it is undoubtedly affected by the terms of the memorandum, and must be considered as having agreed to renew the note at its maturity. This being so, the obligation of the note is not an absolute, unconditional contract to pay the money at maturity. It is a qualified obligation to pay, with a condition that, instead of paying, the holder may give another note in its place which the bank would be bound to accept instead of money. This being so, the case comes within the rule that commercial paper, to be negotiable, must be certain, unconditional, and not contingent.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>In Overton v. Tyler, 8 Pa. 346\u201e Gibson, C. J., said: \u201cBut a negotiable bill or note is a courier without luggage. It is requisite that it be framed in the fewest possible words, and those importing the most certain and, precise contract; and, though this requisite be a minor one, it is entitled to weight in determining a question of intention. To be within the statute, it must be free from contingencies or conditions that would embarrass it in its course; for a memorandum, to control it, though indorsed on it, would be incorporated with it and destrby it. But a memorandum which is merely directory will not- affect it.\u201d In Woods v. North, 84 Pa. 407, Shabswood, J., said: \u201cIt is a necessary quality of' negotiable paper that it should be simple, certain, unconditional, not subject to any contingency. It would be a mere affectation of learning to cite the elementary treatises and the decided cases which have established this principle. It is very important to the commercial community that it should be maintained in all its rigor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">It is manifest from the foregoing that the only inquiry necessary to determine the question of negotiability is, the effect of the memorandum upon the terms of the note. As we have seen, it makes an important change in the note, in that, instead of the note being a distinct contract to pay a fixed sum of money at a day certain, the holder has agreed to accept, instead of payment in money, another note payable at another time which is not fixed. The obligation of the note, therefore, is uncertain, depending on whether the maker chooses to pay it or give a new note in place of it. This uncertainty destroys its negotiability,- and for that reason relieves the indorser. As this is not an action against the indorser to recover damages for breach of an agreement by him to continue his indorsement, that aspect of the case cannot be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
