The defence is that Lydia, took an estate in fee simple or an estate tail, and the plaintiffs cannot recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b204-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>When the codicil was executed, Cynthia Hornet was dead. The personal property which her husband had bequeathed to her, he bequeathed to Lydia by this codicil, and he said it was \u201c in addition to what she had a right to claim by my will of March 16, 1831.\u201d Under that will his wife had a life estate in tins land. He made no change in the devise to Lydia, except to say he confirmed in Lydia \u201c such parts of my estate as I have by said will of March 16,1831, disposed of in favor of my wife Cynthia, to revert after her death to her children, if any;\u201d that is to say, to \u201c revert,\u201d after Cynthia\u2019s death, to her children, if any. Lydia was the only child, and this expression indicates that the testator\u2019s construction of the devise in the will of 1831 was, that Lydia was to have the land absolutely. By that will the land was to descend to her (she was the only child by that marriag\u2019e), and if the devise had ended there, she would have taken a fee simple, especially in the light of what is said in the codicil; but he said, \u201c after her death, without any heirs,\u201d his intention was that the land should \u201c revert to the male children issued from my first marriage.\u201d Whether Lydia left heirs, on her mother\u2019s side, does not appear; but one of the plaintiffs is her half brother, and some of the others are children of -the other half brothers. So it cannot be said she died without heirs, and it may be said she died leaving heirs, and that - the land descended to her in fee simple. It is true this may be called a technical interpretation, but if it is the correct one, it is an end to the plaintiffs\u2019 case. So, too, if she took it as a vested remainder, as claimed by the defendant\u2019s counsel, under McKee\u2019s Appeal, 96 Pa. 277, the plaintiffs have no case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b204-4\">But construing the words, \u201c without any heirs,\u201d to mean without issue, an indefinite failure of issue, she took an estate tailEichelberger v. Barnitz, 9 W. 447.. The authority of this case is unquestioned. So, too, \u201c child \u201d may be construed \u201c heir of the body,\u201d or \u201c issue,\u201d to give effect to the testator\u2019s intention : Haldeman v. Haldeman, 40 Pa. 29. In Covert v. Robinson, 46 Pa. 274, the devise was to testator\u2019s daughters, \u201c but if my daughter Nancy should be called away by death without any lawful heir,\u201d then her share to go to the other daughters ; held, these words meant, if she died without issue, indefinite failure of issue, and she took an estate tail. See also Allen v. Markle, 36 Pa. 117. But aside from this, if as plaint<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>iffs claim, the devise was to Lydia and her children, or issue, and that she took for life with contingent remainder to such children as might survive her, it was an estate tail; \u201c for she had no issue at the time of the devise, and the intent of the deviser was manifest and certain that her children or issue shall take, and as immediate devisees they cannot take, because they are not in rerum natura, and by way of remainder they shall not take, for this was not his intent, for the gift was immediate ; whereupon such words shall be taken as words of limitation : \u201d Taylor v. Taylor, 68-Pa. 488.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b205-5\">Lydia, at the date of the codicil, was nine years old; her mother was dead, and evidently she was the primary object of her father\u2019s solicitude and bounty, and her absolute estate is not to be cut down to an estate for life without clear evidence of such intent: Mickley\u2019s Appeal, 92 Pa. 514. Such an intent is not apparent. The words in the will, \u201c without any heirs,\u201d are words of limitation, indicating an indefinite failure of issue. She took an estate tail, and it having been barred under the act of assembly, the defendant took and has a title in fee simple.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b205-6\">And now, November 19, 1887, judgment on the point reserved, for the defendant, non obstante veredicto.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b205-7\">Judgment having been entered for the defendant, .the plaintiffs took this writ, assigning as error the entry of judgment for the defendant, on the point reserved, non obstante veredicto.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b205-8\"><em>Mr. Thos.

Hall), </em>for the plaintiffs in error:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b205-9\">1. A codicil to a will may be complete in itself as to a particular devise, and then we look to that alone for the intent of the testator. When, however, as in this case, the codicil, so far as relates to the land in controversy in this suit, merely confirms the estate as devised in the original will, the codicil and will must be deemed one instrument and the intent of the testator gathered from the language used in both: Alsop\u2019s App., 9 Pa. 374. What then was the intent of Charles Hornet as expressed in the original will ? Technically expressed, there was a life estate in Cynthia, a life estate in Lydia, with remainder to the children of Lydia contingent on their birth, and- a vested remainder over to the male children of Charles Hornet, by bis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>first wife, should Lydia die without living children : Williams on Real Prop., 268.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b206-5\">2. \u201c Undoubtedly the word, heirs, may be shown by the context to have been used in the sense of sons, daughters, children, etc.; and when it is so used the rule in Shelley\u2019s Case is inapplicable : \u201d Guthrie\u2019s App., 37 Pa. 12. We look then to the will itself to ascertain the sense in which the testator used the word, and it must be borne in mind that the meaning of particular words must be construed in accordance with the whole scheme of the will: Middleswarth v. Blackmore, 74 Pa. 418. That the testator used the word, heirs, in the sentence, \u201c after the death of my children by her without any heirs,\u201d in the sense of \u201cwithout any\u201d children, is apparent from the next provision which in that event gives the land to his male children by his first wife. It would be impossible for him to contemplate the death of Lydia \u201c without any heirs,\u201d whilst his male children by his first wife, and their heirs, were in existence ; yet the death of Lydia without any heirs was the contingency upon which the estate was to pass to these very children. This would be a most absurd provision: Berg v. Anderson, 72 Pa. 90.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b206-6\">3. Another reason which shows that the testator meant child, or children by the word, heir, is that the whole scheme of the will proves that the testator had two leading thoughts when making the will. First, he desired to make ample provision for the support of his wife and daughter: second, he desired the Hornet farm to descend to his children or grandchildren. He therefore provides for his wife a life use and occupancy of the farm, and gives her a large quantity of personal property absolutely. When Ms wife dies it is his thought and care to provide for his daughter Lydia. The whole tenor of the will indicates that the testator was looking ahead, considerately, to make a safe and sure provision for Lydia as long as she lived. The personal property she might spend or squander; the income of the farm was sure for her life. After her death what then ? To her children, if any. If she died childless, what then ? To the male children by the first marriage. A scheme clear, reasonable, provident, consistent and harmonious.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b206-7\">4. In wills, as a rule, the words, heirs, and, heirs of the body, are construed to be words of limitation and not words of pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>chase. The word, issue, is susceptible of either construction, depending upon the general context of the will. The words, child, and, children, are as a rule construed to be words of purchase. Cases can be found where the words, heirs, and, heirs of the body, are construed, as _ words of purchase, and also where, child, and children, have been construed as words of limitation ; but these cases depend upon other language used by the testator clearly showing that the words were used with that intention: Guthrie\u2019s App., 37 Pa. 16; Yarnall\u2019s App., 70 Pa. 342; Gernet v. Lynn, 31 Pa. 98. These cases and many others show that the intent of the testator must govern, and we rely upon this principle, when applied to the mani fest intention of our testator.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b207-5\"><em>Mr. I)'.A. Overton </em>(with him <em>Mr. B. M. Peale), </em>for the defezzdant izz error:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b207-6\">1. From azi inspection of the will it is apparezit that his daughter Lydia was the primary object of the testator\u2019s bounty, and hence, after the decease of his wife, Cynthia, her mother, \u201c it is my will azid desire that the real estate afore-desczibed should descend to the children issued from my marriage with said Cynthia.\u201d If there was nothing further in the clause in question, it is conceded that Lydia, on the death of her mother in 1838, under the provisions of the act of 1833, would have takezi the fee; thus providing a life estate for his wife, with a vested remainder in fee to Lydia, if she survived her mother; the devise to take effect in possession after her mother\u2019s death, subject to open and let izi other children, if any were born to him by his wife Cynthia: Gernet v. Lynn. 31 Pa. 94; Chew\u2019s App., 37 Pa. 23; Fetrow\u2019s Est., 58 Pa. 424. But, after making this provision for the daughter, it seems to have occurred to the testator that possibly the mother might outlive the daughter, or any other children he might have by her, and he therefore added the words, \u201c and if she (Cynthia) should survive them or any of them it is further my intezition and purpose that the same should revert.....to the male children issue from my first marriage.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b207-9\">2. To construe the clause in the second codicil, \u201cto revert after <em>her </em>death to <em>her </em>children,\u201d as referring to Lydia, is to change azid distort the sentence from its grammatical construe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>tion and plain and obvious meaning. \u201c The question in expounding a will, is not what the testator meant, but what is the meaning of his words.\u201d If the will contain the proper and technical words for creating an estate tail, they must have their effect irrespective of the intent of the testator: Phila. Trust Co.\u2019s App., 98 Pa. 209. The testator, in the codicil, does not profess to change in any manner the devise of the real estate, but simply confirms in favor of Lydia what he had before given her in his original will, and then narrates what he had done, to wit: \u201c disposed \u201d of it \u201c in favor of my wife to revert after her death to her children if any,\u201d that is if they survived her.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b208-5\">3. Suppose, however, we concede, for the purpose of the argument, that the devise in the will and the limitation over, were not dependent upon the mother\u2019s surviving the daughter, how would it support the contention of the plaintiffs ? The death of the mother, the tenant for life of the particular estate of freehold capable of supporting the remainder, before the testator, did not affect the devise of the remainder to Lydia: Goddard v. Goddard, 10 Pa. 79. We would then have either a devise in fee to Lydia, which by a subsequent condition, providing \u201c she died without any heirs,\u201d converted it into an implied estate tail, with a limitation over, either as a remainder or as an executory devise; and in either event the limitation over would be barred by the deed of May 5, 1852, and this whether the remainder is vested or contingent: Taylor v. Taylor, 63 Pa. 486. It will not be construed to be an executory devise, if it will admit of any other construction: Doe v. Provoost, 4 Johns. 61; 2 Pedf. on Wills, \u00a7 643.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b208-6\">4. Covert v. Robinson, 46 Pa. 274, rules the present case. There a testator devised to his daughters, \u201c all my real estate .....equ\u00e1lly divided amongst them; but if my daughter N. should be called away by death without a lawful heir, then I order her .share of said estate to be equally divided between my daughters S. and R.\u201d After proceedings to bar the entail, on a case stated it was held that by the will N. took an estate tail which by virtue of the subsequent conveyances became an estate in fee. The first taker is always the first object of the testator\u2019s bounty, and his absolute estate is not to be cut down to an estate for life without clear evidence of such intent: Mickley\u2019s App., 92 Pa. 514; Eichelberger v. Barnitz, 9 W.447. Whe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>ther, therefore, the limitation over be construed as (1) wholly dependent upon the mother\u2019s surviving the daughter, Lydia, according to the strict letter of the will; or (2) as a remainder limited upon an estate tail: or (3) as an executory devise, the judgment of the court below should be sustained.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b209-5\">Opinion,</p>\n<author id=\"AN\">Mr. Justice Gbeen :</author>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">We are quite unable to discover any difficulty as to the character of Lydia Hornet\u2019s estate in the land in question, under the will of her father. The operative words of the will are: \u201c It is my will also and I do order and direct that my dear Cynthia shall have during her natural life the use and occupancy and profits of such parts of the farm whereon I am now living as is hereafter described,\u201d (then follows a full description). \u201cBut after my dear wife Cynthia Hornet\u2019s death it is my will and desire that the real estate afore described should descend to the children issued from my marriage with said Cynthia.\u201d It is beyond all question that these words gave a life estate to the wife Cynthia, with remainder in fee to the children of the testator and his wife Cynthia. It would be a waste of time to discuss so simple a question.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">But it is argued for plaintiffs in\u00bberror that the further words of the will, in connection with the facts as they transpired, reduced this remainder in fee to a life estate with an ultimate remainder in fee to the testator\u2019s male children by his first marriage. These further words follow in immediate connection: \u201cAnd if she should survive them or any of them it is further my intention and purpose that the same should after her death and after the death of my children by her without any heirs revert to the male children issued from my first marriage or from the first bed and to their heirs.\u201d It is claimed that under these words the children of the testator and Cynthia took only a life estate with remainder in fee to the male children of the testator by his first wife. This would certainly be so if the conditions upon which this disposition was based had transpired, but they never did. In point of fact the testator and Cynthia had but one child, Lydia, and she survived both her father and her mother. Cynthia died before the testator. Charles Hornet, the testator, died about 1839, and Lydia did not die until 1886. In this state of facts Lydia fulfilled to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>letter the conditions upon which the land in question was given to her in fee. She was a child, the only child of the testator and his wife Cynthia. Her mother died and after her father\u2019s death the land became hers literally and absolutely, unless it was divested by the remaining clause, or some other clause, or part of the will or codicils. The remaining clause above quoted is principally relied upon to convert Lydia\u2019s fee into a life estate. Now the first and most important condition necessary to work this change was that the wife, Cynthia, should survive her child or children. The words are, \u201cand if she should survive them or any of them it is my further intention and purpose,\u201d etc. But she did not survive them. She died about fifty years before Lydia died and Lydia was her only child. How then is it possible to take from Lydia the clear estate in fee simple which the will gave her, upon the theory that an event happened which never did happen ?</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">But again; another insuperable obstacle in the way of the male children of the first wife is, that before any interest in them could arise it was essential that Lydia should die \u201cwithout any heirs.\u201d In point of fact she did not die without any heirs. She left an abundance of them, not children it is true, but heirs nevertheless. It is idle to discuss the situation in which the word \u201cheirs \u201d may be construed to mean \u201cchildren \u201d or \u201cissue\u201d or even \u201cdevisees\u201d or \u201cdistributees.\u201d Those are cases where it is necessary, in order to give interpretation to doubtful wills, where the meaning is obscure, where the will cannot take effect without attributing another than a technical meaning to the word. But here there is no such difficulty; there is absolutely not the least ambiguity, any more than there would be in case of a devise to one \u201c and his heirs.\u201d Most certainly the law will not be astute to take away from a child a clear fee simple estate and reduce it to a life estate, by a forced and ingenious and strained process of reasoning, the foundation of which is that where a will can only become operative, according to the testator\u2019s intent, by giving to the word heirs a limited or special meaning such as \u201cchildren\u201d or \u201cissue,\u201d such a construction will be given.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">Again in one of the codicils an expression occurs which is invoked in favor of the male heirs by the first wife. The words are, \u201cconfirming in favor of my daughter Lydia such parts of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>my real estate as I have by said will of March 16,1831, disposed of in favor of my wife Cynthia Hornet to revert after her death to her children if any.\u201d It is argued that the words \u201cto revert after her death to her children if any,\u201d refer to Lydia and her children, and as she had none her estate was a lrfe estate only. It is perhaps enough to say that it is impossible to read these words in that way without doing violence not only to the grammatical structure of the sentence but to the plainest and most obvious meaning of the words. The whole of the clause is at best a mere reference to the previous disposition of the will, and does not pretend to be the substitution of new testamentary language creating a new or different estate. But just as it is, the express language and the plain meaning are, to simply confirm the estate of Lydia previously granted by the will, and when in describing that estate, that is Lydia\u2019s estate, he says, \u201cdisposed of in favor of my wife Cynthia Hornet to revert after her death to her children if any,\u201d he unquestionably refers to Cynthia Hornet\u2019s children and Cynthia Hornet\u2019s death. The antecedent of \u201cher\u201d is Cynthia Hornet and in no possible sense Lydia. Again if there were any doubt as to the meaning of the expression \u201c without any heirs \u201d in the will, there is just as much reason for reading it \u201cissue\u201d as \u201cchildren,\u201d and read in that way the estate of Lydia would be at the least an estate tail, which was duly barred by the deed of 1852 to the Gilberts.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">We are of opinion that Lydia took an estate in fee simple which has duly passed to the defendant, and therefore</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
