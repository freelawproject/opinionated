An indictment for murder was found a true bill on January 9th, set ' down for trial on January 29th, and on that date continued on the prison- \u25a0 er\u2019s application. When called for trial on February 7th, the prisoner petitioned for a change of venue on the ground of alleged excitement and prejudice against him, and for a rule to take testimony. The court, offering to hear the testimony at bar, and the prisoner producing none, it was not error to dismiss the application.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b78-16\">2. It appeared that the list of names certified to have been drawn and placed in the jury wheel for the year, by the jury commissioners, contained four names more than the order of court specified. In such case, if by mere accident the wheel contained too many names, it was a harmless irregularity which furnished no ground for quashing the indictment or the array of jurors.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b78-17\">3.

The prisoner had been arrested and committed on January 8d. The case was set down for trial on January 29th, when at the request of the defendant it was continued to February 6th, and then again continued to the next day.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b79-12\">At the trial on February 7, 1889, the counsel for the prisoner moved for a change of venue, alleging as ground thereof the great excitement and prejudice against him in Luzerne county, and asked for a rule to take the testimony of witnesses. The court refused to grant the rule to take testimony, but offered to hear at bar any testimony in support of the petition. No testimony was offered and the motion was refused.1 3</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b79-13\">Counsel for the prisoner then filed motions to quash the array of jurors for the term, and also the indictment, the ground alleged in support of the motions being that, while the order of the court for filling the jury wheel for the year 1889 specified 1550 as the number of names to be placed therein, yet, as shown by the testimony of a witness who had counted the names on the list, the names so placed in the wheel aggre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>gated 1554. One of the jury commissioners, producing the certified list of names, testified that the intention of the commissioners was to place 1550 names in the wheel; that they did so place that number in the wheel, as certified on said list, and that they had no knowledge that four additional names had been put in. The motions were refused.34</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b80-5\">Certain jurors were called, who stated on their examination that they had formed opinions concerning the guilt or innocence of the prisoner from what they had read in the newspapers about the murder, but all said they could render a verdict upon the evidence uninfluenced by such opinions. The challenges were all overruled and the jurors were sworn.5</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b80-6\">The commonwealth offered in evidence a confession alleged to have been made orally to R. J. Linden, at Philadelphia, taken down by a stenographer, transcribed and mailed to Wilkes-Barre, and there signed by the prisoner. It was objected, on the part of the prisoner, that the confession offered was preceded by an engagement on the part of one Thayer, a subordinate of Linden, that the prisoner should be protected both from punishment by the law and from the vengeance of Bevivino, implicated by the confession as the guilty actor; that Thayer had said to the accused after his arrest and being brought before the chief, \u201c that he had better tell the captain all he knew and it would be better for him.\u201d It was shown on the part of the commonwealth that, before giving his confession, the prisoner had been fully cautioned by Linden and told that anything he said would be used against him. The objection was overruled, and the offer admitted.6 7</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b80-7\">The facts of the case sufficiently appear from the charge of the court, Rice P. J., which after general instructions defining the crime of murder at common law and under the statute, proceeded:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b80-8\">Now, gentlemen of the jury, having thus stated the general principles which govern the consideration of the different grades of crime which are included in this indictment, I call your attention briefly to some of the facts which we think it is safe to say are undisputed, or at least which are proved by testimony which is not contradicted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b80-9\">It would appear that on the morning of the 19th of October, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>Bernard McClure and Hugh Flanigan started from the works of Mr. McFadden, above Miner\u2019s Mills, to come to Wilkes-Barre, for the purpose of getting money to pay the men employed at those works. They went to the Wyoming National Bank, and there obtained twelve thousand dollars in money, largely paper money, and also some silver and smaller coin. This was put in a satchel, and they started upon their return. They stopped for a moment at Miner\u2019s Mills, at the post-office, and then started up the road which has been described to you by the witnesses. Mr. McFadden that same morning started down the road for the purpose of coming to Wilkes-Barre. On his way down a short distance, which has been described to you by the witnesses, above what is called the White House road, he found his horse standing in the road, and upon examination found the dead body of Bernard McClure under the wheel. He made no further examination at that time, apparently, but returned to his work, and having got his superintendent they again returned to this scene. They then found, about 500 feet below where McClure lay, the body of Flanigan, he also being dead, having been shot. The money that had been in the wagon was gone. The horse had been shot. The physicians have described to you the wounds which McClure received. They have also produced two bullets which were taken out of his body. They have described the third wound in the head, and have testified that either one of these would have been fatal. These circumstances would be very strong evidence that not only the crime of robbery, but the crime of murder had been committed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b81-5\">There is only one person who has given direct testimony as to what took place at that time, as to the circumstances surrounding that transaction, and that is the defendant. And for the purpose of bringing before your minds the circumstances of the killing, I will read an extract from the confession which he is alleged to have made to Capt. Linden, and then also an extract from the testimony which he gave upon the stand here. Speaking of McClure and Flanigan he says:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b81-6\">\u201c When I got close to the forks of the road, McClure and Flanigan passed me, but I did not speak to them. When they got to the little hill they went slow and I followed them. T see Bevivino come out and shoot from the bushes. He shot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>McClure twice in the back ; then he shot the other man, but I didn\u2019t think he hit him. Then Vallillo came up in front of them and shot the other man twice in the face. I had a revolver in my hand and was running after them. The horse run away and McClure was hanging with Ms feet under the wheel. When they had gone about twenty or thirty yards the old man fell out and Vallillo ran away down the road, and Bevivino looked at me mad, and told me to come. I went with him and when they got to the place where they afterward found the horse he stopped, and then Bevivino shot the horse and shot McClure again in the head. He then shot a good many times at the horse. I was standing still and he ' cursed me and got very white and said: \u2018 Here, you hold this gun and if anybody comes you kill them.\u2019 I held it, and with the knife he cut the straps that held the valise to the buggy, then put the valise on his shoulders and said: \u2018 Let us go through here.\u2019 It was raining and muddy and we went up and took the money and hid it a couple of miles from the scene of the murder; also the gun.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b82-5\">In the same connection I read to you the testimony that he gave here upon the stand, as taken down by the stenographer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b82-6\">\u201cWhen I got to this place they passed me.\u201d Q. \u201cWho passed you?\u201d A. \u201cMr. McClure and Flanigan, they passed me. When they passed me I suppose the old man spoke and he says, \u2018 How do you do ? \u2019 I say, \u2018 How do you do ? \u2019 When they passed I walk with Mm, that is, the buggy was going not on a trot but pretty lively; and they got away from me \u2014 well, here to that officer out to the front door, little closer than that. When I got there I was walking, I had an umbrella in my hand; I seen Bevivino come out of the bush and shot McClure once; after, he shot twice, I think, or tMee times, and McClure first. He was standing on the other side of the buggy, standing on the right side going up. After he shot McClure, McClure fell; he stood a little while and then fell on the .side. After he fell he shot the other man; he shot him two or three times; this here Flanigan, he stands, then he falls. After a little while the horse got scared and the time he shot the first time he looks at me, and that is the time he cursed me to follow Mm, when he looked at me; this here Flanigan was living yet, I suppose; I don\u2019t know; but he was hanging after he spoke to me and cursed me.\u201d \u25a0</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b83-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>Q. \u201c Who cursed you ?

He turns and looked at me; he didn\u2019t say anything at all but he was running; he was out of wind, I suppose. After he got to the place where the horse was found he went to work and shot the horse. After he shot the horse he went to work shot McClure head after lie was dead. Then he told me \u2014 ho go to work, he pulls out a knife, small pocket knife, he cuts the strap and take this here what you call the satchel. After he take the satchel he give me the rifle; he says, 4 Mike, take this and shoot whoever comes.\u2019 I could not say anything; I could not hardly speak. We went across the road and wo went to the place where the gun was hided.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b83-9\">Now, gentlemen of the jury, under this testimony as to the circumstances of the death of Bernard McClure, and the testimony of the defendant as to how that took place, we have no hesitation in saying to you that according to all of the testimony, the killing of Bernard McClure was murder. It was murder of the first degree, because the killing was done by the persons lying in wait. It was murder <em>in </em>the first degree, because it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>was done in the perpetration of the felony of <em>robbery; </em>it was murder in the first degree because it was a wilful, deliberate, premeditated killing.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b84-5\">Was the defendant responsible either as a principal or as an accessory to that crime ? That is the issue which you have been sworn to try, and that is the issue to which your attention has been ably and eloquently directed by the counsel on both sides of the case. According to his own testimony, he was present. According to his own testimony, he fired several shots with the revolver which he claims he had. According to his own testimony, he held the gun while Bevivino took the satchel containing the money. According to his own testimony, he went with Bevivino to the place where it was hid, and on two subsequent occasions went to the same place and took a portion of the money. Now, gentlemen of the jury, we say to you that if this testimony be believed \u2014 it is his own \u2014 then his acts if unexplained, would make him a principal, notwithstanding you were not satisfied that any of the shots fired by him caused the death of Bernard McClure.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b84-6\">There has been considerable argument upon the one side and the other as to whether or not the defendant was the instigator or promoter, or first suggestor of this crime. We do not regard that as an essential fact to be found. If he was there voluntarily aiding and abetting in the commission of the crime, although it was suggested and instigated by another, he would be a principal, and would be responsible in the eye of the law along with the others. The difference in the moral guilt between the parties would be one which the law would not recognize.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AAS\">********</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b84-7\">With these general principles in view we now advert to what we said as to the effect of the defendant\u2019s admitted presence and acts. And we repeat, that, unexplained, they would be sufficient to warrant a jury in inferring and finding that he was a principal, notwithstanding none of the shots fired by him had-a fatal effect.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b84-8\">[What is the explanation ? It is contended upon the part of the defendant, that he did not know the crime was to be committed on that day, and that he came upon the scene unawares ; that he was not a free agent, but that he was coerced into what he did by fear of Bevivino and his alleged friends. This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>defence is to be considered in two aspects. In the first place, if you should find as a matter of fact from all of the testimony in the cause, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the fatal shots were fired by the defendant, then the fact that he was acting under the fear of Bevivino would not excuse or justify this act. Because, while a man may take the life of his assailant for the purpose of preventing the infliction of grevious bodily harm upon himself, or for the purpose of preserving his life, there is no principle of law which would justify or excuse Mm in taking the life of an innocent person in order to protect himself.] 8 [But in case you should find as a matter of fact that the fatal shots were not inflicted by the defendant, then you will inquire whether or not the acts which he performed there were coerced by fear of Bevivino; whether that explanation which has been given by the defendant is such as would show that he had not the power to form the wilful, deliberate and premeditated intent to take the life of McClure.] 9</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b85-5\">Now, gentlemen of the jury, we do not mean to prejudice your minds against the theory which has been set up here by the defendant. It has been presented to you with great power and ability and eloquence by his counsel, and we say to you we do not purpose to interfere with your convictions upon this question of fact. It is our duty, however, we think, to call your attention to all of the circumstances surrounding the transaction, and to ask you to scrutinize this allegation carefully, coolly, impartially.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b85-6\">As has been stated to you, the defendant, while a competent witness under the law, is a man deeply interested in the result of your deliberations. So great was such interest of a person accused of this crime considered to be, that during all the history of the English common law, and of our own common law, until a very few years ago, he was not permitted to testify, because it was feared that the temptation to perjury was so great as to unfit him to be a truthful witness. We think that the law as it is at present is mueb wiser. There may be cases where a man, though charged with a crime of this nature, may explain the circumstances in such away as to convince the mind of the jury of the truthfulness of his testimony, and in such a case he ought to have the opportunity of so doing, because the jury are competent to judge, notwithstanding his interest, whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>his testimony accords with the disinterested testimony in the case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b86-4\">I call your attention in the consideration of this theory, to the circumstances as they occurred at the time, and as they have been explained by the defendant himself, leaving out of view for the present, the confessions which it is alleged he made, and the statements which it it alleged he made before the commission of the crime.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b86-5\">[Upon this question as to whether or not he was acting under duress and fear of Bevivino, and therefore not capable of forming a wilful and premeditated intent to take the life of McClure, I call your attention to his age. I call your attention to the power of will, to the courage, to the intelligence of the man, as exhibited by himself while upon the witness stand, and as shown by the testimony of other witnesses. All of these things are to be considered in determining as to whether or not he was acting under duress. I call your attention also, as to what threats were made at the time. Does the evidence show\u2014 does the defendant\u2019s own evidence sllow \u2014 that there were such threats made at the time, in connection with what had transpired before, as led him as a reasonable creature to presume or fear that his own life or limb was in danger if he did not participate in the crime ? These are questions of fact for the jury. I am expressing no opinion upon them, but I am calling them to your attention and consideration. Yon will take into consideration the place where this occurred. Is has been argued that the defendant was going by an unusual road; that is to say, that he should have turned off to the right at the White House road, instead of continuing to follow McClure and Flanigan by the other road. You have heard his explanation as to that. He says his intention was to go first to his mother, before going to the shanty. I call y0ur attention to the evidence as to the number of shots fired by him, and as to the direction in which they were fired, and as to the aim which was taken by him, if any. I call your attention also to the testimony as to the distance between the point where he says he first saw Bevivino and the point where the horse stood when the money was taken out of the wagon. Was he in'going to that point\u2014 traversing that distance \u2014 acting under the coercion or dominating will of Bevivino, and in fear that unless he did so he would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>be in danger of loss of life or of limb himself? I call your attention also to his testimony to the effect that while the money was being taken from the wagon he held the gun with which the firing had been done. Was he then acting under coercion? Was he then, as a reasonable man, in reasonable apprehension of danger to himself in case ho should not continue to assist Bevivino in his conduct ?] 10</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b87-5\">Now, I repeat, gentlemen of the jury, that while I deem it my duty to call your attention to these various circumstances, distinctly, I am not expressing any opinion; I am not trying . to thrust indirectly into the jury box any opinion of my own.....</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b87-6\">Now, gentlemen of tlie jury, having called your attention to the circumstances which occurred at the time, as shown by the uncontradicted testimony in tbe cause, and as shown by tbe defendant\u2019s testimony either here or elsewhere, T call your attention to the other circumstances in the case from which it is claimed upon the part of the commonwealth that this crime was planned beforehand, and that the defendant was a willing member of the combination which formed this plan.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b87-7\">According to the defendant\u2019s own testimony and admission, ho knew from the declarations of Bevivino that this crime was contemplated. He says that when it was first mentioned he thought it was a joke; but that the second time it was mentioned and thereafter, he appreciated that Bevivino was in earnest. You have heard the reason which he has given for not making known his knowledge. He says that it was by reason of threats which Bevivino made that either he or bis friends would make away with him in case lie should reveal the secret. That is for your consideration as explaining the fact that, possessing this knowledge that tbe crime was contemplated, he yet made no complaint to tbe officers of the law and gave no warning to the men against whom it was contemplated. [1 call your attention to tlie testimony with regard to the purchase of the gu\u00f1 wbicb bas been offered in evidence. 1 do not purpose to go over that testimony in detail. But does tlie testimony show that it was done with a knowledge of the purpose to which it was to be put, on the part of tbe de- . fendant ?] 11 1 call your attention to tbe testimony of Antonio Napalillo as to the declarations which he alleges were made by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>the defendant to him; and here there is a conflict of evidence; not an absolute conflict in all particulars, but a conflict in a material particular. Both Napalillo and the defendant agree in saying that the plan of murdering and robbing McClure was suggested to Napalillo. .Both of these witnesses \u2014 that is Napalillo and the defendant \u2014 agree that Napalillo declined to have anything to do with it. Napalillo testifies, however, in effect that not only Bevivino, but also the defendant approached him for the purpose of inducing him to join the conspiracy, and made certain threats as to what would be done in case he should betray them. On the part of the defendant, he testifies that he never gave his assent to the undertaking, but that always when he gave a definite answer to Bevivino, it was to the effect that he could not do it. You will endeavor to reconcile the testimony of .the witnesses if possible. You are to take into consideration in weighing their testimony, the interest which they may have in the case. You are to consider in the defendant\u2019s case the interest which he has in your verdict. You will consider in Napalillo\u2019s case whether or not he is testifying as he does in order to shield himself from punishment. You are to take into consideration the manner of the testimony, the impression which the witnesses make upon your mind, as to being truthful and candid, or otherwise; and it is for you to decide what is the truth with regard to any disputed question of fact. For if the testimony be believed, and there be no reasonable doubt in your mind as to its truthfulness, that the defendant did make to Napalillo the proposition which he says defendant did, and accompanied it with threats which he says he did, that would be entirely inconsistent with the theory of the defendant upon the trial, that he was coerced into this by fear of Bevivino.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b88-5\">In considering this allegation as to the defendant being under duress, I call your attention to the testimony of the defendant as to the nature of the threats. Is there any evidence that he was threatened by any person except Bevivino ? He says that he was threatened by Bevivino that he would be killed or put out of the way either by Bevivino, or his friends, or the members of the society to which he belonged, in case he should lose his courage and not do his part, or words to that effect. [Is there any evidence in the case of knowledge upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>tlie part of the defendant that Bevivino had such friends, or that he was a member of such a society, or that such would be the result, etc., except the statement which he says Bevivino made to him?] 18 The point that I desire to call to your attention is this: In considering whether or not the defendant was acting under duress by reason of threats which Bevivino had made, it is important for you to consider what was Bevivino\u2019s ability to carry out those threats, or at least what was the defendant\u2019s belief as to Bevivino\u2019s ability to carry them out. Because, if they were not such as to produce in his mind fear that the result threatened would be carried out, then he could not set them up as a defence for his act.....</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b89-6\">I call your attention, now, to the testimony with regard to the confession which is alleged to have been made to Captain Linden after the defendant had been arrested. In many particulars the confession as narrated by Captain Linden, and as reduced to writing, is not different from the testimony given by the defendant upon the stand. There are, however, some important particulars in which they do materially differ, and therefore it becomes our duty to lay down the law to you with regard to the reception of confessions of persons accused of crime.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b89-7\">Where a man freely and voluntarily \u2014 -that is, without fear or hope of benefit \u2014 makes, and intelligently makes, a statement, of course it is evidence of a very high nature. But in order to warrant the admission in evidence of the confession of a person accused of a crime, it must appear, in the first instance, that it was free and voluntary, and was not wrung from him by fear, or by hope that he would be bettered or advantaged thereby. That is, the inducement for the confession must not be the promise made to him, or hope held out to him, that it would be better for him to confess, by any person having authority. According to the evidence of Captain Linden, the defendant was in the company of his under officer, Thayer, and while in his company, Thayer made statements to the defendant as to the propriety of his making a confession to Captain Linden, and as to the advantage which would accrue to him if he did make such a confession, which, if they had been the inducement for the confession, would have required us to reject it from evidence. A promise by an officer to a person in charge, that it would be better <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>for Mm in the end to confess and tell what he knows, is such a promise as prevents the reception of the confession in evidence. But in order to warrant the rejection of a confession upon the ground that it was induced by a promise, it must appear that the promise was the inducement to the making of the confession. If, therefore, the promise ' or inducement which had been held out by Thayer, was not the inducement which led the defendant to make the confession, then it would be admissible in evidence. Upon this question there is a conflict of evidence. In the first instance, it was the duty of the court to decide as to its admissibility, and, acting within the province committed to us, we decided that it-was admissible, and it was read in your hearing. But the defendant says that after he had returned from Thayer\u2019s room, Captain Linden then made promises to him as to what would be the advantage to him if he told all that he knew. On the other hand you have the testimony of Captain Linden to the effect that he then cautioned him that he could make no promises to him, and that if he told him anything he must tell him the truth, and with the knowledge that he would use it against Mm. Now, if this had the effect of removing from the defendant\u2019s mind the hope wMch may have been born there by what Thayer had said, then we cannot say that this w\u00e1s not a free and voluntary confession. It is for you to determine, then, whether the confession made to Captain Linden was a free and voluntary one, under the instructions we have given to you upon this question of law, or whether it was induced by the hope that he would be advantaged by making it, and that this hope was caused by promises held out by the officer in charge. In case you should find that it was not a free and voluntary confession, then you will reject it from consideration. This applies, however, only to what was said to Captain Linden, and to what was done with regard to the confession itself. It would not operate to the rejection of the testimony as to what he and Captain Linden did after they got to Wilkes-Barre that night, with regard to finding the property which had been hidden in the woods above Miner\u2019s Mills. That would be evidence in any view of the case. In case you should decide that this confession was free and voluntary, then you will remember the testimony as to what took place the night that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>they had the first interview, and also what was reduced to writing the next day. You are, in view of the discrepancy between that and the testimony, in some particulars, given here upon the stand by the defendant, to consider whether or not it is correctly reported. Have the statements made by the defendant at that time been correctly, accurately reported ? Has anything been omitted from that statement which would tend to qualify it or put a different light upon it ? Has anything been interjected into that statement which was not said by the defendant ? In deciding this question, you are to consider all of the circumstances. You are to consider also the testimony as to the care with which it was prepared \u2014 the care exercised not only by the officers but by the defendant himself.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b91-5\">Now, gentlemen of the jury, our duty as far as the trial of this case is concerned is ended.....</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b91-6\">On February 11, 1889, the jury returned a verdict that the prisoner was guilty of murder in the first degree.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b91-7\">On February 25,1889, a rule for a new trial was discharged, and the prisoner, Michael Rizzolo, is called before the court and asked if he has anything to say why sentence should not be pronounced upon him, and he replied that he had nothing to say.\u201d Judgment was then passed that the prisoner be executed.

The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>evidence was all on one side. The court simply reviewed the evidence, and this necessarily presented the strong points in favor of the commonwealth. The record exhibits compliance with every reasonable requirement. No other sentence except sentence of death could be pronounced upon the verdict recorded. The words, \u201c of death,\u201d therefore, would have been surplusage.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b94-5\">Opinion,</p>\n<author id=\"Ahm\">Mr. Chief Justice Paxson :</author>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">The first seven assignments of error are not in accordance with the rules of court, and might well be dismissed for this reason alone. But we are not unmindful of the fact that a human life is at stake; that the defendant below is a friendless man, and a stranger in a strange land. We will consider the alleged errors as though they had been properly assigned.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">The defendant moved the court below for a change of venue. In support of this motion his affidavit was filed, setting forth his belief that he could not have a fair trial in the county of \u25a0Luzerne by reason of the great excitement and prejudice there against him. He therefore asked for a rule to take the testimony of witnesses, to prove the facts alleged in his petition. The court refused to grant the rule, but offered to hear at bar any testimony in support of the petition. The defendant asked for \u201c more time to get the subpoenas, and get the witnesses.\u201d This was refused by the court, and very properly. The application was not made until the case was called for trial. It might and should have been made at an earlier period in the term. It was said by the learned judge : \u201cWe must decline to postpone it. We think he ought to be prepared now. He has had the whole of this term to make the application, and we think it would make a very bad precedent to lay it down that an application of this kind might be reserved in this way, and a rule granted permitting the taking of testimony thereafter. We think it is the defendant\u2019s duty to produce his proofs now, to sustain the petition. We will hear them now.\u201d No proofs were offered, and the motion fell. There is no merit in these assignments.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-8\">The defendant also moved to quash the indictment, and also the array of jurors. These motions were based upon an alleged irregularity in filling the jury wheel. It appeared that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>tlie order of court for filling the jury wheel for 1889, specified 1550 as the number of names that should be placed therein. It was alleged that the names of 1554 jurors were actually placed in the wheel, being four in excess of the number ordered by the court. A witness was examined who had counted the names on the list, and he stated the number to be 1554. The certificate of the jury commissioners was produced stating that they had placed the proper number, viz.: 1550, in the wheel. One of the said commissioners was examined, and testified that their intention was to put in 1550 names ; that they did so, and had no knowledge of four additional names having been put in. It is very clear that if the wheel did contain 1554 names, it was a mere accident, probably the result of an error in addition, an error which might occur with the most careful and accurate commissioners. It was a mere irregularity, of a harmless nature, and furnishes no ground to quash the array.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">It was also alleged that the court erred in disallowing the challenges for cause to certain jurors. The names of the jurors even are not given, but I have gone through the type-written copy of the testimony to ascertain whether the objection was well taken. The challenges were all properly overruled under Allison v. Commonwealth, 99 Pa. 17, and the cases which have followed it. The jurors objected to had all formed opinions of greater or less strength, from what they had read in the newspapers about the murder, but they all said they could render a verdict according to the evidence, uninfluenced by their previously formed opinions. \u2022 There was a time when a stricter rule prevailed, and a juror was excluded from the box when he had formed an opinion as to the guilt or innocence of the accused. At that tim\u00e9, intelligent jurors could be found who had formed no opinions in regard to a case, for the reason that they had heard or read little about it. That was before the telegraph and the press brought to every man\u2019s door the news of every event and every crime, within a few hours of its occurrence, with full details of everything connected therewith. All this is now changed; within twenty-four hours of the commission of this murder, it is safe to say that by means of the wire and the press, the details of it. had been read by nearly every intelligent man, not only in Luzerne county, but in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>state, and that but few persons had not formed some opinion in regard to it. The law upon this subject has necessarily advanced with the changed circumstances ; it has merely kept abreast of the times, and adapted itself to what the common judgment and common sense of the people see is essential to the proper administration of the criminal law. To return now to the old rule, would exclude from the jury box in many instances every man of average intelligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">We find no error in admitting in evidence the testimony of Captain Linden in regard to the defendant\u2019s confession,\"nor to the admission of the confession itself. His testimony was competent and rebutted any allegation of undue influence in obtaining it. He said to the defendant: \u201c If you have anything to tell me, in God\u2019s name tell me the truth; if not, tell me nothing. You have a right to keep your mouth shut. I tell you now, as your lawyer would tell you, I can make you no promise ; I cannot even ask you to tell me a word; but I tell you now, anything you say to me I shall use against you. It is my duty to do so. Now, if you feel like telling me anything, go ahead; but tell me nothing or tell me the whole God\u2019s truth.\u201d In view of this we regard what Thayer said to the defendant as unimportant; and as between the witness and the defendant, we are not surprised the jury believed the former, who was a reputable, disinterested witness, while the latter was testifying with a halter around his neck.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">Most of the remaining assignments are made up of extracts from the charge of the court. They are isolated from the charge, but whether we take the charge as a whole or in sections it is free from error. The question whether the defendant was acting under duress or threats on the part of Bevivino was submitted to the jury under proper instructions as to its effect upon the degree of guilt. This appears from that portion of the charge referred to in the ninth assignment, which is as follows : \u201c But in case you should find as a matter of fact that the shots were not inflicted by the defendant, then you will inquire whether or not the acts which he performed there were coerced by fear of Bevivino; whether that explanation which has been given by the defendant is such as would show that he had not the power to form the wilful, deliberate, and premeditated intent to take the life of McClure.\u201d We need not pursue this branch of the case further.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>There remains but to notice the sixteenth and last assignment, which alleges that \u201c the record does not show that the prisoner was asked whether he had anything to say why sentence of death should not be pronounced against him.\u201d The record shows that the defendant was asked if he had anything to say why sentence should not be passed upon him. As no sentence was possible but that of death we think there was no omission. The rule is thus stated by Blackstone, vol. 4, p. 376: For when, upon a capital charge, the jury have brought in their verdict of guilty, in the presence of the prisoner, he is either immediately, or at a convenient time soon after, asked by the court if he has anything to offer why judgment should not be awarded against him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">This defendant has had ail the advantages which our humane system of laws afford; with no claim except that of common humanity, he was assigned, without cost to himself, able counsel to defend him, who have performed that duty with zeal and ability, not only without fee or reward, hut without the hope or expectation of any; his case was tried before an impartial jury by a learned and able court, not only without error, but with conspicuous care and impartiality, and after a verdict of guilty he has had his case reviewed in the highest court in the state. He was allowed to he heard here in forma pauperis, to save him the cost of printing the testimony. It was his misfortune that a chain of testimony, in addition to his own confession, pointed to him with terrible distinctness as one of the perpetrators of a cold-blooded, mercenary murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">The judgment is affirmed, and it is now ordered that the record be remitted to the court below for the purpose of execution.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
