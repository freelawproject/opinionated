This account showed a balance in favor of the trust, and among the moneys accounted for was the sum of $100, received on July 28, 1888, from Joseph Birkbeck, on account of coal rents. The account was confirmed on January 7, 1889.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b142-4\">On April 5, 1889, it was agreed between Maggie S. Paine (late Maggie A. Lee) and the trustee, that, as the only question raised with respect to the distribution of the fund in the trustee\u2019s hands, was in relation to the item of $100, coal rents, the distribution of the fund including said item should be made by the court directly, without reference to a master or auditor; and the parties thereupon filed the following agreement as to the facts:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b142-5\">Now, April 5, 1889, it is agreed that the following stated deed and the record thereof in the recorder\u2019s office in Luzerne county, be received in evidence, to wit: deed of J.

That, at the time .of the execution and delivery of the above mentioned deed, the ownership of the premises conveyed thereby, was vested in said Maggie A.

Frank Lee had no ownership therein, and had no interest therein other than as husband of said Maggie A. Lee.,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b142-8\">2. That the surface of the said premises (which is recited in said dee.d as being in the ownership of the parties of the first part, but which was actually only in the ownership of said Maggie A. Lee, as aforesaid), was at that time and had always been, from the time it was reclaimed from nature, used for agricultural purposes.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b142-9\">3.

That, the only other source of income from said conveyed premises, aside from said surface, existing at the time of the execution and delivery of said deed, was that arising from the rentals of a lease, then existing, of about twenty-five acres of the upper vein of coal on said land, and that the said lease was then producing, in rentals or royalties, to the said Maggie A. Lee, not exceeding the sum of three hundred dollars annually, and that there was, and is, no probability that the same would, or will, yield a larger annual rental than the sum named.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b143-5\">5. That, at the time of the execution and delivery of said deed, said Maggie A.

That, after the execution and delivery of said deed, the said Maggie A. Lee became discovert, and that she has since become married to William L.

Paine.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b143-7\">7. That the said Maggie S. Paine has four children living, of whom two are children by her former husband, J.

J., filed the following opinion :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b145-7\">This ease differs from former Pennsylvania cases, hut not from the English cases, upon the subject for consideration, in that the instrument we are called upon to construe is a deed and not a will. Nevertheless, in determining whether the rents or royalties accruing under a coal-lease, which the trustees were empowered to make, are capital to be invested, or income to be paid over to tbe life tenant, the intention of tbe parties is to control. \u201c The intention of a deed is as much the governing rule of construction as in a will, except that the former still requires formal words of inheritance to make an estate of inheritance in .conveyances of real estate:\u201d Phillips\u2019s App., 93 Pa. <em>45; </em>Huss v. Stephens, 51 Pa. 282 : Criswell v. Grumbling, 107 Pa. 408; Mergenthaler\u2019s App., 15 W. N. 441.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b146-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>Whether we confine our attention to the provisions embraced within the four corners of the instrument, or view them in the light of the surrounding circumstances, as shown by the statement of facts agreed to, we have no doubt that in the understanding and intention of the parties the term \u201c income \u201d includes the periodical payments, in the nature of \u25a0 rent, which are usually made under coal and other mineral leases. It includes not only the rents from opened mines, but also from mines to be opened under leases to be executed by the trustees, with the consent of the life tenant, by virtue of the powers contained in the deed. The reasons for this conclusion are fully stated in Eley\u2019s App., 108 Pa. 300, and the cases which follow in its lead, and need not be repeated : Shoemaker\u2019s App., 106 Pa. 392; Wentz\u2019s Appeal, 106 Pa. 301; McClintock v. Dana, 106 Pa. 386.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b146-4\">It is suggested in opposition to this construction of the deed in question, that the coal may be exhausted before the children of the life tenant attain their majority, and in that case the provision for their maintenance by her out of the income might fail. The parties may have regarded this as possible, but we doubt if they regarded the exhaustion of so large a body of land as probable. If they had considered that a sufficient reason for treating the coal royalties as capital, the interest upon which only should go to the life tenant, it seems to us that they would have guarded against the contingency by providing expressly for an accumulation and investment of the royalties. At all events the argument based on this bare possibility is more than offset by the argument in favor of the construction based on the possibility that the interest on the coal royalties, together with the income from other sources, would not'be sufficient to enable the life tenant to carry out her agreement to properly support, maintain, and educate her children during their minority.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b146-5\">On a view of the whole case we are unable to distinguish it from the cases cited. We therefore hold that the rents or royalty in the accountant\u2019s hands derived from a lease of the coal made pursuant to the powers contained in the deed, are to be regarded as income, and, under the terms of the deed, are payable to Mrs. Paine.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b146-6\">Now, April 6, 1889, the balance in the accountant\u2019s hands, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>as shown by the partial account filed December 15, 1888, is awarded to Maggie S. Paine.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b147-5\">The trustee then took this appeal, specifying that the court erred:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b147-6\">1. In awarding the fund for distribution to Maggie S. Paine.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b147-7\">2. In holding that under the trust deed of November 7,1881, Maggie S. Paine was entitled to the corpus of the purchase money to be paid under the sale made and deed delivered by the said trustee, under the power of sale in the said trust contained.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b147-8\"><em>Mr. J. Vaughan </em>Barling, for the appellant:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b147-9\">The single question raised in this record is whether the purchase money of the coal shall go to one of the equitable life tenants, viz., Mrs. Lee, now Mrs. Paine, to the exclusion of the other life tenants, namely, her children, or shall be so far treated as purchase money ordinarily is treated, that these children may be surely provided for.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b147-10\">1. When Eley\u2019s App., 103 Pa. 300; Shoemaker\u2019s App., 106 Pa. 392; Wentz\u2019s App., 106 Pa. 301, and McClintock v. Dana, 106 Pa. 386, cited by the court below, were decided, this court had not assumed, at least as definitely as it has since done, the position that these supposed coal leases were out and out sales; that they passed the whole title to the miscalled lessee, and that what was in them called \u201c rent \u201d was, in fact and in law, merely purchase money, which as in the case of other sales, went to the administrator of the lessor. But under the doctrine of the later eases, Hope\u2019s App., 2 Cent. E. 43, and Fairchild v. Fairchild, 7 Cent. R. 873, it is impossible to treat the purchase money going under these instruments to an administrator as \u201cincome,\u201d unless, as in the case of a will, the intention to give the thing itself is clear, or, in the language of Mr. Justice Clark, in McClintock v. Dana'; the intention \u201cbeing established,\u201d the \u201ctechnical character of the rental becomes unimportant.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b147-11\">2. But while the intention is as much to be sought for in a deed as in a will, yet in the former, legal and technical terms must be given their proper and established meaning. In the first instance, therefore, the instrument, under which the fund for distribution arises, must be regarded as a conveyance or sale, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>executed by the trustees under the power to sell, and the fund itself the purchase money. The deed of November, 1881, clearly grants the power to lease, as something distinct from the power to sell. The former power is to be exercised without reference fib Mrs. Lee; the latter only under given circumstances and with her written consent. And that the donors recognized the distinction between a lease proper and a sale, or its now constructive equivalent, a coal-lease, is shown by their express reference to the latter as such equivalent \u201csale or coal-lease.\u201d By no canon of construction can the limitation as to circumstances and consent be referred back so as to qualify the first granted and absolute power to lease.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b148-4\">3. It is true, that under the English cases, rents, under a coal lease executed by executors or trustees under powers given either by will or deed, go to a life tenant, just as the rents of an opened mine would do. But it must be remembered that the logic of the English cases is, that, these instruments being leases, the royalties or returns made for the coal taken are rents and therefore constitute income, and go to the heir and not to the administrator. Whereas, the logic of the Pennsylvania cases is; that these instruments are not leases, but sales, and the rents and returns for'the coal taken are purchase money. It is therefore difficult to see how in this state, that which is declared to be purchase money, arising under a sale and going to an administrator, can at the same time be called rent, or income, and go either to the heir or tenant for life.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b148-5\">4. All the cases relied on in Pennsylvania, were not merely cases or wills, but were cases in which the person claiming the fund was the only direct and certain object of the testator\u2019s bounty; as, for instance, a son, to whom a share of the residuary estate had been devised, or an only child, etc., and where the remainders over were either to an ascertained person or to an unascertained clas\u00e1. But there are direct considerations apparent on the face of the deed and the surrounding circumstances, as they appear upon this record, which show that the purchase money, or the. price of the coal, was not to go to Mrs. Lee. In the first place, she was not the donor\u2019s direct, or even remote, object of bounty. She was to take under the deed something less than she had had before its execution, and she was to assume out of what she was to get under that deed, the support <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>of these children. Her husband gave up his curtesy estate, but not to her. With him, as with her, the only common object of bounty was the children. It was for their support, maintenance and education, that both parents united in giving up their respective estates in this land.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b149-5\">5. A construction that would give the corpus of this estate to the wife, free from the husband\u2019s curtesy, and leave the children nothing, must be radically wrong. The elder of the children, at the time of the execution of this trust deed, was not five years old. In the sixteen years before her majority, at least $160,000 would have gone to the mother. It is certainly possible, and indeed very probable, that within that period all the coal could be exhausted or paid for in advance, and nothing left for the support and education of the children. It is no answer to this to say that the deed might have contained an express trust for an accumulation or an express limitation of the mother\u2019s right, for the reason that the technical terms in the deed, as we have endeavored to show, simply are those of a sale, and the only trusts to the mother are for the income and not for the purchase money; and this legal intent and effect of the instrument can only be avoided or overturned by a supposed intention to treat as income, that which is certainly and cleai'ly, under the later cases in Pennsylvania, nothing but purchase money.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b149-6\"><em>Mr. Alexander </em>Farnham, for the appellee:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b149-7\">1. It is a great mistake to imagine that the doctrine that the grant of a right to take coal to any extent is a grant of an interest in the land, is of recent recognition in this state. The question first came before this court in Caldwell v. Fulton, 31 Pa. 475; again, in Harlan v. Leh. Coal &amp; N. Co., 35 Pa. 287; likewise in Stoughton\u2019s Appeal, 88 Pa. 198. See also Justice Woodward\u2019s opinion in Funk v. Haldeman, 53 Pa. 243, quoting Bainbridge on Mines, 246. There is nothing new therefore in Hope\u2019s App., 2 Cent. R. 43, and Fairchild v. Fairchild, 7 Cent. R. 873. In addition to the cases cited by the appellant against us, we furnish another, viz.: Duff\u2019s App., 12 Cent. R. 544, s. c. 21 W. N. 491, which wont so far as to decide that royalty under a mining lease is not rent, but part of the corpus of the land. Of course the cases mentioned are each and all to be viewed in the light of the surrounding facts or conditions affecting the subject.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b150-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>2. This doctrine, however, does not prevent the owner, where the rights of no mortgagee intervene, from treating and disposing of that which is taken from the land as being divested of its characteristics of realty and partaking of the nature of personalty. As against a mortgagee, the owner\u2019s intention will not avail to deprive the former of his lien security upon all that stands in place as part of the land; but as against the remainder-man, such intention must prevail, because it is solely by the will of the owner that he is a remainder-man. So, also, with respect to the reversioner : the will of the owner, as manifested during his lifetime, by opening mines, may divest the thing mined of its character of realty during the existence 'of the life tenancy, giving its proceeds to the holder of the latter. As before remarked, each of the cases referred to, wherein the nature of a lease of minerals, or of the rentals therefrom, have been determined, must be viewed in the light of surrounding facts.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b150-5\">3. The intention of a deed is as much the governing rule of construction as in a will, and the construction of this- deed, with respect to the coal-rentals, must come within the operation of the same principles that obtained in Eley\u2019s Appeal, Wentz\u2019s Appeal, McClintock v. Dana, and Shoemaker\u2019s Appeal. We find on examination that the powers granted to the trustees are the same, viz., to lease the coal and to pay over the income of the estate to certain cestuis que trust. In these cases the grant of power to the trustee to lease the coal is held as being tantamount to the testator having leased it himself in his lifetime. That this court regards the like powers in a will and deed as expressing a like intent, is evident from its reasoning in Eley\u2019s Appeal, supra, in which Justice Stebjrett cites Daly v. Beckett, 24 Beav. 114, and quotes the language of the master of the rolls, applying it to the case in hand. The circumstances of that case are in almost perfect analogy to this one, in whatever aspect we regard it. . It is a deed creating the trust, using like language respecting the income, the like power to lease coal being granted, and the like circumstances, as to the coal, existing, even to that of a small portion of one of the veins being already under lease.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b150-6\">4. It is also to be remembered that, as to the children, Mrs. Lee was the absolute owner of the property, having the right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>to pass the inheritance by will to other than her own offspring. She voluntarily took on herself the obligation to maintain and educate them during their minority. Had she not executed this deed, and had leased the coal, her absolute right to the whole of the rentals would have been unquestioned. So, also, if she had leased it before executing the deed. It certainly cannot be supposed that she would voluntarily give up this possible source of income, and, after granting such pow\u00e9r as to enable the coal to be leased, at the same time intend that she .could not avail herself of its proceeds to the same extent as if she had leased it herself. On the contrary, it appears from the surrounding facts specified in the agreement, and it likewise appears all through the provisions of the deed, that the grantors looked to the coal-rentals from future leases of the same as a source of income for her enjoyment, she simply stipulating that she would educate and support her children during their minority, and securing her covenant out of the same source of income.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b151-5\">Per Curiam :</author>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">We affirm this decree upon the opinion of the learned judge of the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">Decree affirmed and the appeal dismissed at the costs of the appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
