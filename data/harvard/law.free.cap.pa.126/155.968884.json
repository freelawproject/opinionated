S.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b179-10\">On May 10,1887, tbe petition of O. H. Hollister, as clerk of tbe directors of the poor of Crawford county, was filed in the Court of Quarter Sessions, representing that one John O\u2019Donnell, of South Shenango township, was an old and poor person, unable to work, and that an order of relief for him had been issued to the directors of the poor; that petitioner was informed and believed that said O\u2019Donnell had a son named Patrick O\u2019Donnell, living in the same township, who was of sufficient ability to maintain his said father: Praying for an order on said Patrick O\u2019Donnell to relieve and maintain the said O\u2019Dqnnell. To a citation awarded upon the filing of said petition, Patrick O\u2019Donnell answered, inter alia, that he was ready and willing to support his father, whenever he might choose to come and live with him. On July 1, 1887, the court entered an order that \u201c Patrick O\u2019Donnell, at his own charge, relieve and maintain his father,.....at the rate of $1.50 per week, with the penalty provided by law, payable on the last of every fourth week, from this date.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b179-13\">On March 19, 1888, on motion, the court entered a rule to show cause why an attachment should not issue against Patrick <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>O\u2019Donnell to enforce compliance with, the order of July 1, 1887, To this rule, the respondent filed an answer, April 9, 1888, setting forth that the order of July.l, 1887, was illegally, unlawfully and improvidently made, as he had not been heard by himself or counsel; that the petition did not set forth that said John O\u2019Donnell was likely to become a burden upon the directors of the poor; that the directors of the poor did not in fact make any application to court for an order of support of said John O\u2019Donnell, but the same was made by an unauthorized person not recognized by or known to the law; that the respondent is poor and unable to pay the sum of $1.50 a week for his father\u2019s support outside his own family; that he is ready and willing to support his father in accordance with his station in life and his means, if he will come and live with him: praying to have original order opened and he be given leave to make proof of these facts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b180-6\">After argument, the court, on July 2, 1888, dissolved the rule for the attachment, and on July 3d the respondent filed a motion to set aside the order made July 1, 1887, and to quash the original order and all proceedings thereunder, for reasons appearing of record.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b180-7\">Upon this motion a rule to show cause was granted and after hearing, the court, He\u00ededeeson, P. J., on January 14, 1889, filed the following opinion:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b180-9\">There can be no doubt that the order for support in this case was made- with the consent of respondent\u2019s counsel. The amount allowed by the court is not large, and it will be necessary for the respondent to comply with the order before he can secure a modification of it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b180-10\">The order was made July 1, 1887, and no attention was paid to it by the respondent until proceedings for attachment were had some nine months afterwards. If the respondent\" had exhibited a disposition to comply to the extent of. his ability, he would be in a better position to ask the relief which he seeks. We will assume that the petition in which the proceedings were commenced was made by the clerk of the directors of the poor, etc., as agent for said directors, and that therefore it is sufficient.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b180-11\">The petition to set aside the order of July 1, 1887, and to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>quash the proceedings is dismissed at the cost of the petitioner, and leave is now granted to issue a writ of fieri facias for the amount now due under the terms of said order, unless the money is paid within twenty days from this date.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b181-4\">Thereupon the respondent took this writ, assigning as error the dismissal of his petition filed July 3, 1888, praying that the order of July 1, 1887, should he vacated.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b181-5\"><em>Mr. Pearson Ghureh, </em>for the plaintiff in error:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b181-6\">Counsel cited: Order on Thomas James, 116 Pa. 152 ; Act of April 15, 1857, P.
