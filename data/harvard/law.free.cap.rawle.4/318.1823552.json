On presenting the drafts to the first teller of the United States Bank, he was told that they would draw for the amount on other banks in the city, and hand it over to him as soon as it was received; at the same time he was requested to call again at a certain hour named by the teller. The defendants accordingly drew out of three other banks, eighty-nine thousand dollars in specie, of which the first teller directed forty-two thousand dollars, to be handed over to the plaintiffs\u2019 agent. The latter returned to the bank at the time specified, which was about four or five hours after his first visit, when he received from the first teller certain boxes, said by him to contain specie to the amount of forty-two thousand, one hundred and thirty dollars. The boxes were brought from carts into the Bank of the United States, and not from the vaults of the bank. The agent of the plaintiffs, for the purpose of better securing the money, caused it to be taken out of the boxes, placed in kegs made purposely for specie, lined with hoops nailed on the inside of the chimes and the outside of the heads, and iron hooped or bound. This was done in the Bank of the United States by a cooper employed by the plaintiffs\u2019 agent, in his presence, and also in the presence of the porter and several other officers of the Bank of the United States, particularly of the first teller. The porter was present during the whole time they were repacking the specie. There were forty-two boxes, each said to contain one thousand dollars, and the balance, of one hundred and thirty dollars, was paid at the counter. The boxes were placed in the back room of the Bank of the United States, where there was ample room for counting it, and tables placed for that purpose, and it was proved to be the practice of the bank to allow time for counting there after banking hours. The kegs remained at the Bank of the United States until the plaintiffs\u2019 agent took them away for transportation. From the bank they were taken on board the steam-boat, where they remained under the charge of the agent of the transportation line, until the return of the plaintiffs\u2019 agent, who had gone to some other banks for specie which he had to receive. He took his passage on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>board the steam-boat in which the specie was placed, and accompanied it as far as <em>Trenton, </em>from which place it was transported to <em>Brunswick, </em>in wagons, accompanied by himself, and from <em>Brunswick </em>it was carried on board a steam-boat to <em>New York, </em>where it was delivered at the bank of the plaintiffs. From the time the steamboat left <em>Philadelphia </em>with the specie on board, until it was delivered at the Merchant\u2019s Bank in <em>Nevo York, </em>by their agent, it was constantly under his eye. When it was delivered there, the kegs were in good condition, uninjured, and bore no marks of violence. When the specie was delivered to the plaintiffs\u2019 agent, he was not requested to count it, nor was any objection made to his doing so. On his examination as a witness in the cause, he stated, that he thought it would have taken him at least two days to count it. The first teller, who was also examined as a witness, swore that it would require about an hour to tell by weight forty thousand dollars, and that three persons might count that sum in three or four hours. He likewise swore, that it was always left to\u2019the person who received the money, to attend to repacking it. The kegs of specie were delivered by the agent to the first teller of the Merchant\u2019s Bank, in <em>New York, </em>on the 6th of <em>December, </em>1825, and were opened a few days after, behind the counter in the banking room. From the time they were received, until they were opened, they were kept in the vaults of the bank. The specie was counted by the first teller, assisted by the porter, of the Merchant\u2019s Bank, when the deficiencies in the kegs above mentioned were discovered. The alleged deficiency was communicated on the 28th of <em>December, </em>1825, by letter to the cashier of the <em>Philadelphia </em>Bank, who was requested to ask for payment of it from the Bank of the United States. A statement of the amounts deficient in the five kegs, was at the same time transmitted. Application for payment was accordingly made to the defendants, by whom it was refused. The depositions of the agent, first teller and porter, of the Merchant\u2019s Bank, were then sent on, and the application for payment renewed, which the Bank of the United States again refused.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b320-6\">The first teller of the Bank of the United States testified, that there was an understanding between the Bank of the United States and the other banks in this city, that where specie goes in the original boxes, mistakes shall be corrected, but that with foreign banks, the Bank of the United States had never, in any instance, corrected an alleged mistake. There had been some small errors with foreign banks, to the amount of ten or fifteen dollars, and one to the amount of fifty dollars, but in that instance the money had been counted and afterwards weighed. These errors seldom occurred, and had never been corrected. He also testified, that if an error had been discovered at the time the specie was repacked, the defendants could have ascertained in what bank it had occurred, but that after mixing it up, there were no means of knowing.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b320-7\">Judge Coxe, before whom the cause was tried, instructed the jury thus: \u2014 \u201c That supposing the jury to be satisfied that the deficiency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>of one hundred and ninety-two dollars did exist at the time of the delivery of the boxes in payment of the draughts, then, if the jury be satisfied from the evidence, that <em>Catlin, </em>the agent of the plaintiffs, knew that the boxes of money were received from other banks, although he did not know the names of said banks, nor what banks, further than that they were banks of this city; that he knew the said boxes were marked so as to ascertain the bank from which each was received ; that he knew that the error could be rectified so as to protect the defendants if a deficiency were ascertained in the original boxes \u2014 if he knew the defendants delivered the original boxes taken in payment, immediately on their receipt, to facilitate his departure without counting, and relying on his care, diligence, and integrity, as well as that of the officers of the banks from which they were received, and that the boxes were delivered t-o ascertain if correct, and were placed in a proper room, with counters and other conveniences for ascertaining the amount, and that Catlin, the plaintiffs\u2019 agent, knowing these facts, chose to have the original boxes broken open by a cooper, and boy, and the contents thrown .into kegs, each containing three boxes, and mixed up the money received from different banks, so that it was impossible to identify them, and thus the said agent of the plaintiffs, knowingly prevented the defendants from protecting themselves from the loss which arose from the errors of the other banks, and not from their own, and the said agent then took on the said money to <em>New York, </em>on the 3rd or 4th of December, and delivered the same to the plaintiffs, who kept it until the 25th of <em>December, </em>before they counted it; if these facts be established from the evidence, in the opinion of the jury, together with the knowledge of them by <em>Catlin, </em>the plaintiffs\u2019 agent, I am of opinion it would be contrary to equity for the plaintiffs to recover in this action.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b321-4\">To this opinion the counsel of the plaintiffs excepted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b321-5\"><em>J.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aqk\">There is a' rule which disposes with perfect and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>unquestionable justice of every loss, which must be borne by one of two or njore innocent persons, by assigning it to him whose act was the cause of it. Both parties here are blameless; and the question is, whether the act of the one or the other contributed more to produce the stale of things, which renders a loss by one of them inevitable. The facts are, that at the time of the transaction they stood in the relation of debtor and creditor; and that to answer the convenience of th\u00e9 former, the specie given in payment, was drawn <em>from </em>three other banks instead of its own vaults. It was contained in boxes taken at the tale of those banks, by the defendants in the first place, and afterwards by the plaintiffs, whose agent had an opportunity and every necessary facility to tell the money fo.r himself, but omitted to do so ; so that according to the custom in such cases, the boxes were delivered and received by common consent, without a particular examination of their contents: consequently, it is unnecessary to decide the vexed question, whether it be the business of the party paying, or the party receiving, to see that the money -is right. There was a tacit agreement to deliver and receive the boxes, according to their nominal amount; and though an agreement founded in mutual mistake of a fact which was the inducement to if, be not usually conclusive, where it is not explicitly understood that the parties are respectively to take the risk of the fact as being in a particular way, it certainly is otherwise where the consequences of unravelling the transaction, would put the opposite party in a worse situation than if the agreement had not been made. The creditor requiring a review of the transaction, to ascertain the amount actually paid, must be able to show that the debtor cannot possibly be prejudiced in this respect. How he is to show it, is not the question here, where he has shown, on the contrary, that the defendant would suffer an irretrievable loss from the plaintiff\u2019s own act in confounding the contents of the boxes, and thereby rendering it impossible to fix the deficiency on any particular one of the banks from which the boxes were procured. By the plaintiffs\u2019 own showing, then, the act which rendered the loss inevitable, was done by its own agent. In putting- the cause to the jury, the judge laid particular stress on the agent\u2019s supposed knowledge of the circumstances. That would undoubtedly strengthen the case, as it would be a species of bad faith, knowingly to deprive the defendant of the means of recourse to another for the deficiency, and at the same time to insist that the defendant should make the deficiency good; but it was not an essential ingredient. Between parties equally innocent, and consequently equally meritorious as to every thing else, the personal responsibility for the act which led to the loss, is sufficient to turn the scale, for the reason, that every man should bear the consequences of his own acts, just as he should bear his own misfortunes. The case then, as it appeared on the evidence, and clearly as it was put to the jury by the court, was one on which the plaintiffs could not recover.</p>\n<p id=\"AVh\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
