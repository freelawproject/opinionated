His Honour permitted the paper to be read in evidence, observing, at the same time, that its effect might depend on future proof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b135-6\"><em>Abel Abbot, </em>a witness produced by the defendants, being under examination, the plaintiff\u2019s counsel put to him the following question. \u201c Could the canal have been laid nearer the river than it is, without altering the level as it stood above and below, without injuring the company?\u201d This question was objected to by the defendants\u2019 counsel, but the court permitted it to be answered.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b135-7\">In the course of the trial, the counsel for the plaintiff offered in writing to prove by <em>John Musselman, </em>the following facts:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b135-8\">1st. \u201c That when the article of agreement given in evidence by the plaintiff, was signed, the route of the canal through <em>Christian Bertsch\u2019s </em>land was staked off: That it was expressly agreed between the parties that the canal should be dug on the ground staked off: That the plaintiff was unwilling to sign the agreement until it was stipulated that it should be so dug: That it was further expressly stipulated that there should be two locks built on the plaintiff\u2019s land, which would have been a benefit to the plaintiff, so as, in a small degree, to compensate him for the injury to be done him, and the situation of the locks was pointed out by Mr. Fell: That <em>Bertsch </em>refused to let the canal be dug further into the land than where the stakes were placed, and said he would sign the agreement on those terms: That the route of the canal was subsequently, and without the assent of <em>Bertsch </em>changed, and laid more than the width of the canal in some places further in upon the land of <em>Bertsch, </em>which was his best land: That the locks have not been built as stipulated for by Mr. <em>Fell, </em>at the time of signing the agreement, and not one is on <em>Bertsch\u2019s </em>land: By means of which alterations, much more damage has been suffered than would have been suffered had the canal been located where it was originally designed ; and that <em>Christian </em>did not then understand, and cannot read English.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b135-9\">The plaintiff then further offered to prove\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b135-10\">3d. \u201cThat in the construction of the canal, locks, &amp;c. the defendants occupied a large portion of the farm of the plaintiff, driving through with their carts, carriages, &amp;c. and their superintendents, agents and workmen working on the same, by which he was deprived of the use of his farm for a whole year ; destroyed a large quantity of fence of the plaintiff,- on his land; flooded the water on his meadow, by the diversion of three springs mentioned in the declaration, and by increasing the depth of the river, by the dam below the land of the plaintiff; wholly deprived the plaintiff of the profits of his apple-distillery, wool-carding machine and smith-shop, which before that time did a large business; and took stones from the.land of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>plaintiff, for constructing and erecting their slope-wall and locks, for which no compensation has been made.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b136-5\">The evidence thus offered, was objected to by the counsel for the defendants, and overruled by his <em>Honour, </em>who, in rejecting it, gave the following</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b136-6\">Ofiniok. \u2014 If any thing is omitted in an agreement by fraud or mistake, we suffer it to be corrected. This is one thing \u2014 to vacate the agreement entirely, is a different matter. To correct an agreement is one thing, to declare it void is another. This latter seldom occurs, unless in case of misrepresentation of material matters.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b136-7\">The expression that the agreement cannot be partly in writing and partly by parol, requires much limitation. <em>It is not true </em>as to errors in reducing it to writing. When it is intended actually to make a different contract, by introducing stipulations substantially varying the written agreement, and making it a different contract, not correcting it by adding omissions, the expression is true. The written agreement is to pay for land which should be taken. The parol agreement is to sell a particular designated place. If this were admitted, the agreement would go for nothing.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b136-8\">Butin <em>another point of </em>view, after <em>a contracthas been </em>carried into effect, and ruin would follow the rescission of it, as in a contract to pay for flooding land by a mill, and then denying the contract, and by assize of nuisance, pulling it down, courts will, unless there has been much fraud, leave it to be compensated in damages.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b136-9\">If there is no agreement you proceed by petition; if there is an agreement, you must sue on it, and this court has no jurisdiction, unless in a suit on the agreement. It then becomes a question, not only as to parol evidence to vary an agreement in a common suit, but one to set aside a contract and give jurisdiction, and in this case, as the agreement was made, you must sue on it, and recover for a violation of it, if you can. Here we have no jurisdiction to correct it. We have jurisdiction only where no agreement has been made.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b136-10\">In <em>Christ </em>v. <em>Diffenbach, </em>1 <em>Serg. </em>&amp; <em>Rawle, </em>464, and some other cases, it would not have been heard that a tenant could have been sued as a trespasser, or for use and occupation, and unlimited damages given. Here, if the plaintiff has any claim, it is fora breach of the agreement. By his agreement he had taken his case out of this law. It is one thing to make the defendants pay for half the breadth of the canal, if that could be done; another to set aside the whole contract. <em>Collam </em>v. <em>Hooker, </em>1 <em>Rawle, </em>108.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b136-11\">This evidence puts an end to the paper; renders it useless, and makes an entirely different contract. As well might it be proved that a bond was not to be paid. The sale of land for a canal, seems to preclude all idea of a suit for damages done by it to the distillery, the mill, and in preventing access to the river. You admit an agreement, binding if they had lived up to it. Neither party contemplated choosing arbitrators, an appeal and trial in court for damages done by the canal.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b137-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>The plaintiff was nonsuited, and afterwards moved to take off the nonsuit:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b137-5\">1st. Because the court erred in permitting the question to be put to <em>Abel Abbot, </em>which was objected to by the counsel for the plaintiff as stated above.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b137-6\">2nd. Because the court erred in rejecting the evidence proposed to be given by the plaintiff, as contained in his first written offer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b137-7\">3rd. Because the court erred in rejecting the evidence proposed to be given by the plaintiff, as contained in his second written offer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b137-8\">The Circuit Court having refused to take off the nonsuit, the plaintiff appealed to the court in bank.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b137-9\">On the argument in this court, <em>Brooke, </em>for-the appellant, abandoned the first of <em>the reasons </em>assigned for <em>taking </em>off the nonsuit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b137-10\">In reference to the second, he observed, that at the time the plaintiff and the president of the <em>Lehigh </em>Coal and Navigation Company, Mr. <em>Fell, </em>were negotiating, in reference to the land of the former, he was extremely unwilling to enter into the agreement in question. He was not disposed <em>to take </em>twenty-five dollars an <em>acre, but </em>Mr. <em>Fell, </em>who had been going along the line of the canal, making agreements with the owners of land, told him that the line was marked out, and that the company would put two locks on his land, which would have been a great advantage to him, as he contemplated keeping tavern. These representations and promises were the inducement to execute the agreement, but the stipulations of the defendants were not complied with, and consequently the plaintiff was not bound by the agreement. It was an executory contract, depending on certain conditions to be performed, and the parties had a right to alter the terms of it, or if one party departed from it, fhat party was bound to make compensation to the other. After the plaintiff had executed the agreement on the faith of the assurance of the president, that the canal-would be made as it was then staked out, the company departed from the contemplated line, and this the judge who tried the cause would not permit the plaintiff to prove. The mode of proceeding which he adopted was the only remedy open to him to obtain compensation for the injuries he sustained. An action upon the agreement would have afforded no remedy, for he could recover upon it no more than twenty-five dollars an acre for the land, which would have been a very inadequate compensation. Indeed, no action could have been maintained at all. <em>Hopkins </em>v. <em>Mehaffy, </em>(11 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>126,) proves that <em>Fell, </em>who was the agent of the company, could not have been made to respond in damages; and as no seal was affixed to the instrument, an action of covenant could not have been maintained against the company. Nor could the plaintiff have brought assumpsit, set forth the agreement, and then shown it had been departed from, for that would have been to make the agreement a nullity. Where there is fraud, moral or legal; where a party has been deceived, misled, or mistaken, and the contract is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>virtually destroyed, parol evidence is admissible to prove such facts. Here the agreement was rescinded in consequence of not having been complied with by the defendants, and the proceeding directed by the act of assembly was the only remedy the plaintiff had. The replication was not in the nature of a plea of <em>non est factum </em>,\u2022 it averred that the plaintiff did not agree in the manner and form alleged by the defendants, and the object of the evidence was to establish this averment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b138-6\">The third reason assigned for taking off the nonsuit was abandoned.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b138-7\"><em>J. M. Porter, </em>for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aib\">The agreement having been pleaded, it was incumbent on the defendants to prove its execution only, and that the canal was constructed according to that agreement, for the act of 1818 gives no authority to institute such a proceeding as this, except where the parties have been unable to agree. To show that the agreement was different from that which was excuted by the parties, parol evidence was clearly inadmissible. It was not contended that there was any actual fraud. The rule by which parol evidence is admissible to affect a written instrument is to be restricted, not enlarged. <em>Iddings v. Iddings, 7 Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>115. Without enlarging it the evidence offered in this case could not have been received. A written agreement cannot be contradicted, added to or diminished, by parol evidence. <em>Thomson </em>v. <em>While, </em>1 <em>Dallas, </em>426. Nor can an independent promise, made at the time of executing a written agreement be proved by parol. <em>O'Harra </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>4 <em>Dall. </em>340. <em>Heagy </em>v. <em>Umberger, </em>10 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>339. A written instrument cannot be explained by parol evidence. <em>M'Dermot </em>v. <em>United States Ins. Co., </em>3 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>609. Nor is such evidence admissible to vary its contents. <em>Heilner </em>v. <em>Imbrie, </em>6 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>401. It is admissible only to show fraud, mistake, or trust. <em>Cozens </em>v. <em>Stevenson, </em>5 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>421. <em>Collam </em>v. <em>Hocker, </em>1 <em>Rawle, </em>108. Parol evidence of conversations previous or leading to a written agreement, cannot be received. <em>Gilpin v. Consequa, </em>1 <em>Peters, </em>85-87. <em>M'Kennan </em>v. <em>Doughman, </em>1 <em>Penn. Rep. </em>418. Parol evidence cannot be given of a fact in relation to which there is a written agreement. <em>M'Kinney </em>v. <em>Leacock, </em>1 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>27. <em>Marshall </em>v. <em>Sprott, Addison, </em>361. Where however there has been a parol agreement to alter a water coure, it may be proved, provided the agreement has been carried into effect, but not otherwise. <em>LeFevre </em>v. <em>Le Fevre, 4 Serg. </em>&amp; <em>Rawle, </em>241. A written agreement cannot be controlled, <em>altered, or even </em>explained by parol testimony, except where an ambiguity or uncertainty, arising from some extraneous circumstances, is to be removed. <em>Richards </em>v. <em>Kellam, </em>10 <em>Mass.

Turnpike Company, </em>2 <em>Penn Rep. </em>466.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b139-6\">The opinion of the Court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b139-7\">Kennedy, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ApG\">We think that the plaintiff ought to have been permitted to have given the evidence contained in his first offer, so far as it tended to prove that at the time the agreement was made and entered into between the plaintiff and the defendants, which the latter have pleaded as a bar to this proceeding of the former, the line or route of the canal was then laid out and designated by stakes set up through the plaintiff's land, and that the written agreement which has been set out by the defendants in their plea, was made in reference to that line, and that the land lying between it and the river is the same land that is described in the said agreement; and that the defendants instead of confining themselves to this line as there staked out, in constructing and making the canal, or at least keeping between it and the river, extended the canal beyond the line, and further from the river, into the other land of the plaintiff, and thus cut off a greater quantity of land from the main body of his farm than was agreed on, or embraced in the agreement set out by the defendants in their plea. So far as the plaintiff offered to give evidence to this effect, we think it was admissible, because it cannot properly be considered testimony which would go to contradict, alter, add to, or detract from the written agreement between the parties; but tended to explain the same by giving locality and identity to the subject-matter and applying the contract to it, which is every day\u2019s practice. See 13 <em>Petersdorf\u2019s Abr. </em>108, note. As often as written agreements fail to describe by metes and bounds the lands contracted for, and <em>to </em>give a precise locationto them, the omission is always supplied, and the application of the agreements made to the lands by the introduction of parol evidence, which has ever been considered competent; otherwise, in most cases the agreements could never be carried into effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">The evidence which the plaintiff offered to give, to show that the defendants agreed to build two locks upon that part of the canal which passes through his land, as a part of the consideration he was to receive for parting with his land to the defendants, was of a different character, and went to establish a very different agreement be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>tween the parties from the one reduced to writing and set forth by the defendants in their plea. This evidence we think was properly rejected by the court; ior to have received it, would have been in direct violation of that rule so well established, that parol evidence is not admissible to contradict, alter, add to or diminish, a written instrument.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">The other testimony offered by the plaintiff, and rejected by the court, was not admissible ; some of it, because it did not fall within the provisions of the third section of the act to improve the navigation of the river <em>Lehigh, </em>which is the section under which this complaint was originated and must be sustained if at all. It would rather seem to be within the terms of the fourth section of that act; and as to the residue of the evidence rejected, it appears to me that it was not admissible upon any ground of complaint. If the plaintiff did sustain any such damage as he alleged for the introduction of it, I am inclined to think it was <em>damnum sine injuria.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">As this cause is to go back to the Circuit Court for a new trial, it is proper to notice the opinion which was delivered by that court in respect to the mode of proceeding in this case to which the plainiff has resorted after having made an agreement with the defendants which they have set forth in their plea. The judge in the Circuit Court was of opinion that this course of proceeding could only be adopted and pursued under the provisions of the act already referred to, where the parties could not agree upon a compensation. In this we think his Hon-our was right. But we also think that where an agreement has been made between the company and the owner of the land for compensation, as in this case, that if the company should afterwards, without regard to such agreement go on and make their canal through the land of the owner, on ground contrary to, and different from that which was agreed on, as is alleged was done here, the owner of the land would thereby be at liberty to rescind the agreement. Beside, it is quite obvious, if what he proposed to give evidence of, be true, that an action brought by him against the company for a breach of their covenant could not afford him adequate redress, because the land occupied by the canal and cut off from the main body of his farm, is not all included and bargained for in the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">If, however, the plaintiff upon the next trial should fail to make sufficient proof to convince the jury that the company violated their agreement in departing from the ground agreed on for the line and course of the canal, he must fail entirely to recover anything in this proceeding. He must then look to his agreement, and be content with the compensation provided for by the terms of it. If it was fairly made, and has been observed and kept on the part of the company, the plaintiff is bound by every principle of honour, law and justice to abide by it on his part, whether it was a bad or a good bargain for him.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-9\">The judgment of nonsuit set aside, the cause reinstated, and remanded to the Circuit Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
