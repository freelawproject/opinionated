The will was written by the testator himself, who, though an illiterate man, has made his intention manifest. It is the right of every man, to make his own will, and to express his meaning in his own way. If the intention plainly appear, and be not contrary to the policy of the law, it must be carried into effect, no matter how awkwardly it may be declared. An unlettered man, often uses words in a different sense from that in which they would be understood by a grammarian or a lexicographer, and it is the business of courts, to endeavour to ascertain the meaning affixed to them by the person by whom they are employed, and to give them effect accordingly. <em>Morrison </em>v. <em>Semple, </em>6 <em>Binn. </em>97. <em>Steele </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>14 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>98. <em>Cassell </em>v. <em>Cooke, 8 Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>289. The question then is, what did the testator, <em>Joseph Neide, </em>mean by his devise to his son <em>John ? </em>His intention is to be gathered from the will alone, and from the whole will, and it is so clearly expressed, that no plain man, whose mind is not narrowed by legal technicalities, can entertain a doubt on the subject. The testator was an uneducated old man, the father of nine children, and sat down to make a disposition, in his own way, of all his property, and a provision for all his children. His main intent is to provide for his eldest son, the primary object of his bounty, the devise to whom is introduced, with very remarkable language, strongly serving to illustrate his views. The words \u201c <em>principally, and first of all,\u201d </em>would not be satisfied by giving to <em>John, </em>in reference to whom they are used, merely an estate for life, in the property devised to him. The subject of the devise to <em>John </em>is, the testator\u2019s \u201c <em>late </em>purchase\u201d from <em>Elizabeth Claxton. </em>It is impossible that he should have intended, by these words, to describe either the locality or the extent of the land he had purchased; he must have meant, that <em>John </em>should have all his estate and property in it; all that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>acquired by that purchase, he gave to his eldest son, and as he purchased an estate in fee simple, he gave an estate in fee simple, by that devise. Wherever the words of the will describe merely the situation of the property devised or serve to identify it, an estate for life passes, but where they refer to the interest of the testator in it, they pass that interest; thus \u201c estate,\u201d <em>\u201c </em>effects,\u201d \u201c substance,\u201d \u201c all I have in the world,\u201d with many others of similar import, carry a fee. 3 <em>Preston on Abst. </em>158. <em>2 Preston on </em>Estates, 87 to 187. <em>Bailis </em>v. <em>Gale, 2 Ves. Sr. </em>48. <em>Scott </em>v. <em>Audrey, </em>3 <em>Atk. </em>493. 2 <em>Lev. </em>91.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b78-6\">The twenty-three acres, purchased from <em>Elizabeth Claxton, </em>were the principal devise, and having ascertained the estate which the devisee took in that, the question is determined as to the interest he acquired in the four acres of woodland, subsequently devised. The latter was an accessary to the former, and followed its nature. Whatever estate was given in the one, was given in the other. The two devises are connected by the word <em>also, </em>which is synonimous with <em>in the same manner, </em>and consequently, if a fee is given in the <em>purchase </em>from <em>Elizabeth Claxton, </em>a fee is given, <em>in the same manner, </em>in the four acres of woodland. If an estate for life only was given in the woodland, <em>John </em>would have the burthen <em>of </em>paying taxes imposed upon him, without deriving the smallest advantage from the devise, and as it is supposed, that a benefit is intended by every devise, the court will not give to a will such a construction as that contended for on the other side, unless the language of the testator imperatively requires them to do so. The intention of the testator, with respect to the devises in question, is further shewn by other parts of the will. After having disposed of his real estate, he proceeds to make a disposition of his personal property, and couples the two descriptions of property by the word also; <em>also, \u2018 </em>lgive and bequeath to my son <em>John </em>one horse and one <em>cowthat is, in the same </em>manner <em>that </em>I <em>have </em>given him the land, I give him the personal property, and as the es-ate given in the latter was absolute, that given in the former was absolute too. This is the only construction which will ensure harmony and symmetry; any other, will produce discord, confusion and absurdity. If, according to the opposite construction, <em>John </em>takes an <em>estate for </em>life, with a remainder in tail <em>to Joseph, </em>then <em>John, </em>in <em>the </em>event of <em>Joseph </em>dying without issue, is to take two shares of an <em>estate </em>which is not to be brought into existence, until after his death, and vet it is the same estate of which he is to enjoy the whole during his life. This is the conclusion at which the opposite argument must necessarily arrive, and it is so absurd, as to destroy the argument altogether.

R. Ingersoll </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AUj\">\u2014 It is to be lamented, that the adoption of the <em>English </em>rule, in the construction of devises, should in <em>Pennsylvania, </em>so frequently defeat the intention of the testator; but judges are not legislators, and it is now too well settled to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>be disputed, that a general devise of land, without limitation, passes only an estate for life. The will under consideration, contains no words, legally denoting an intent to give a fee simple. The word, <em>estate, </em>which it has frequently been decided carries the fee, refers not only to the subject-matter of the devise, but to the duration of interest. But the word, <em>purchase, </em>conveys no idea of interest. It is merely a term of description, used to distinguish the particular property devised from other property. <em>Loveacres </em>v. <em>Blight, Cowp. </em>355. 2 <em>Preston, </em>69. <em>Morrison </em>v. <em>Semple, </em>6 <em>Binn. 97. Steele </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>14 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>84. A devise of a certain number of <em>shares, </em>in the <em>JVew River, </em>a word much more comprehensive than <em>purchase, </em>was held in <em>Middleton </em>v. <em>Swain, Skinner, </em>339, to give only an estate for life. The intention to give a fee simple, must be clear and unambiguous, otherwise the rule of law must take place. There must be express words or necessary implication to defeat the title of the heir at law. If the language be of doubtful import, he cannot be disinherited. The devise in question, has no words indicating an intent give an inheritance, and there is nothing which by a fair interpretation, can be made to supply the want of them. Where the words are not of themselves sufficient to show an intention to give a fee, it may be inferred from something being superadded, which is obviously inconsistent with the idea of an intention to give a less estate. Such a result takes place where a general devise is charged with the payment of a sum of money ; but in no instance has a word of similar import to the word <em>purchase, </em>been held to pass a larger interest, than an estate for life, unless something in the nature of a charge was superadded to it. <em>Busby </em>v. <em>Busby, </em>1 <em>DaTl. </em>226. <em>French </em>v. <em>M\u2018Ilhenny, 2 Binn. </em>20. <em>Lessee of Caldwell </em>v. <em>Ferguson, 2 Yeates, </em>250. <em>Doughty </em>v. <em>Browne, 4 Yeates, </em>179. <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Carson, </em>12 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>54. <em>Green </em>v. <em>Creamer, 2 Yeates, </em>378. <em>Grayson </em>v. <em>Atkinson, </em>1 <em>Wils. </em>333. <em>Right </em>v. <em>Sidebotham, 2 Doug. </em>762. <em>Lessee of Burkart and Willis </em>v. <em>Bucher, 2 Binn. </em>455. <em>Lessee of Willis </em>v. <em>Bucher, </em>3 <em>Wash. C.C.R. </em>369.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b79-7\"><em>Joseph </em>had an estate tail by necessary implication. The intention was to provide for his issue, which could be effectuated only in this way. The court must give a construction to the whole instrument, and not such a one as will create an intestacy as to any part of the testator\u2019s estate. Every thing is embraced in the sweeping residuary devise to <em>Joseph, </em>of <em>\u201c </em>all the remainder\u201d of the testator\u2019s \u201c lands not heretofore willed,\u201d and in case he should die without issue, then over. He had willed to <em>John, </em>only an estate for life, and this devise carried the remainder of the estate in the lands given to him to <em>Joseph, </em>in tail, an indefinite failure of issue being contemplated, which creates an estate tail. <em>Hopewell </em>v. <em>Ackland, </em>1 <em>Salk. </em>239. <em>Hyley </em>v. <em>Hyley, </em>3 <em>Mod. </em>228. 1 <em>Roberts on Wills, </em>439. 442. <em>Attorney General </em>v. <em>Sutton, </em>1 <em>P.

After a short preamble, it contains as <em>follows: </em>\u2014 \u201c Principally, and first of all, I give and bequeath to my eldest son, <em>John Neide, </em>my late <em>pnirches, </em>from <em>Elizebeth Claxon, </em>as also, four akres of woodland, being a-corner laying between the <em>Bristo </em>field and <em>Sharplesses\u2019 </em>land, further J give to my said son <em>John, </em>the corner piece of <em>mash </em>from the cross bank out to <em>lo </em>low water mark, with a privilege to <em>pas </em>and <em>repas </em>to and from said <em>mash, </em>through the plantation, also to quarry stone <em>be on </em>(beyond) the said mash, as also, I give and bequeath to my son <em>John </em>one <em>hors </em>and one cow.\u201d He then gave to each of his five daughters a legacy in money; and to his son <em>Jacob </em>fifty pounds to be paid in one month after his decease. Then to his son <em>Benjamin, </em>twenty acres to he taken in the <em>Bristo </em>field, to begin at <em>William </em>Swaffers\u2019 and running from thence by the <em>Percimen </em>tree to the great road; then other small devises to some grandchildren, and to a mulatto boy, and proceeds, <em>\u201c </em>and I do give and bequeath the remainder of my lands not hereto<em>jfore </em>willed to my son <em>Joseph Neide, </em>but in case he should die without issue, then my son <em>John Neide, </em>shall have two shairs, and the remainder to be equally divided among the survivors,\u201d and appointed <em>Joseph </em>his executor.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">It has long ago been said, that after the statutes of wills in the time of <em>Henry 8, </em>the devisee was called for want of a better term, and to distinguish him from the heir, a purchaser, and the will of a testator was compared to a deed, and the same, or nearly the same, legal accuracy in designating the quantity of estate, was required in a will, which was requisite in a deed. As the now common accomplishment of writing was then rare, and some of the learned must be applied to before a writer could be found, the inconvenience was not in those days great. Within a century, however, more in proportion could write, though they could not write in legal phrase; and it became a question, what words pass a fee in a will. Lord Hobart, than whom, says Chief Justice Willes, <em>\u201c </em>a greater man never lived,\u201d laid down some principles which are law yet, and beyond which the law has not advanced much, though other expressions than those on which he decided, have been held within the principle he laid down. In Hobart, page 2, <em>Widlahe </em>v. <em>Harding, </em>the testator devisod to his cousin <em>Agnes Harding, </em>and her assigns, his dwelling house for ninety-nine years, \u201c and my said cousin <em>Agnes Harding, </em>shall have my inheritance, if the law will allow it,\u201d and adjudged she took a fee. In page 32 of his reports, we find this expression, \u201c If a devise do sufficiently and certainly shew the intent of the devisor in the substance, though the circumstances fail, or be defective, I care not.\u201d In page 75, <em>Spark </em>v. <em>Purnell, </em>he says: \u201cIf by my will I say <em>J. S. </em>shall be heir of my lands, he shall have it in fee; this though /\u2022 <em>S. </em>is no relation,\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>I shall notice only a few of the many cases on this subject, observe ing that many judges have said, that when an unlearned man gives a horse, and in the same sentence or a different one gives a house, and the courts decide that each shall not hold absolutely and forever, they always disappoint the intention of the testator. I admit, however, that we are not at liberty to decide that a simple devise of lands to a man unconnected with any thing else passes a fee, for we would by so doing, unsettle estates for some years back. The legislature alone can do it prospectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">Where the words used, not only apply to land, but to the quantity of interest which the testator has in it, or which he disposes of, that interest passes. There are many contradictory cases, as between, \u2018I give my estate,\u2019and, \u2018I give my estate in <em>A.,\u2019 </em>or, \u2018my estate at <em>A.\u2019 </em>but the law seems to have settled down in this, that each of these expressions passes a fee, unless restrained by other parts of the will. \u2014\u2018All my effects\u2019 \u2014 \u2018 whatever else I have in the world;\u2019 <em>(Talbot\u2019s </em>cases, 286 ;) \u2014 \u2018 all lam worth,\u2019 \u2018 what I die possessed of,\u2019 \u2018 what is left after my debts are paid,\u2019 \u2014 the words, property, \u2014 substance, and many others have been held to pass a fee. In short, there has been an astuteness to find a meaning which can justify or excuse the courts in giving afee where it is plain the testator intended it;\u2014 and though somejudges have held in some cases that their predecessors had gone too far, and have doubted some of the decisions, yet the current has still set in the same direction, and cases doubted by one judge have been considered clear of doubt by his successors. I refer to the authorities collected in 2 <em>Preston on Estates, </em>from 90 to 186, in <em>Roberts on Wills, Powel on Revises, </em>and many other books.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">It is apparent however that it is not so much the particular word or phrase used, as the context, or the scope of the whole will, which passes the fee; every word and expression in the English language has different meanings in connection with different words or applied to different subjects. The express devise to a man and his heirs and assigns, is often cut down by other' expressions or by being applied to a long lease, to estate tail or to an estate for years; and so a devise without words of addition may carry a fee if the expression used shows that the testator had in view the quantity of interest as well as the description of the property given. The rule once was, that the heir at law cannot be disinherited by any other than express words or necessary implication, In <em>Fagge v. </em>Heaseman, <em>Willes, </em>141, Chief Justice'Willes shews, that this rule though often repeated has not been acted on, and is inconsistent with many decisions of judges who have used it, and he says the true rule is, that it ought plainly to appear to be the intent of the testator, or the heir will pot be disinherited.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">In our own courts the same principles have been laid down in nearly the same words. 2 <em>Binn. </em>19. 6 <em>Binn. </em>97. 1 <em>Yeates, </em>250, 380. 9 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>434, and other cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-9\">In this will the word heirs no where occurs. The words <em>my late </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number><em>purchase </em>as used, may and naturally do as well as a description of the property include a description of the estate or interest in the property. The case in 2 <em>Vesey, </em>48, has nearly the same phrase and was held to pass a fee. But it was contended the devise to <em>Joseph </em>of the remainder of his lands not heretofore willed, showed that <em>John </em>had only a life estate and the remainder to <em>Joseph. </em>The answer is, that he gives to <em>Joseph </em>the remainder of his lands not before willed ; not the remainder of his estate in those lands, and further that this construction will make the will absurd. The testator could not have intended to give to <em>John </em>for life, and after his death to <em>Joseph, </em>and after <em>Joseph\u2019s </em>death two shares to <em>John. </em>There were other lands not before mentioned to satisfy the devise to <em>Joseph; </em>those lands he gave to <em>Joseph, </em>and no others.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">On the whole, we have found no case directly in point. The case above cited in 2 <em>Vesey, </em>48, is the nearest to it. The very words \u2018 1 give my new purchase,\u2019 &amp;c. are put in <em>Hobart, </em>32, as an example that a fee may pass by those words in a certain connection with other words; we think however that the phrase, * my late purchase,\u2019 is equivalent to, \u2018 what I lately purchased,\u2019 and that would describe the interest given as well as the property given. The <em>\u2018 </em>four acres of woodland\u2019 is so coupled with * the late purchase,\u2019 that it goes as the other does, that is, in fee. <em>John </em>then, having devised this property to <em>Jacob, </em>the fee simple is in <em>Jacob, </em>and judgment must be entered for him.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">Judgment for the defendant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
