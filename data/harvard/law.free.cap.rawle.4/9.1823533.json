That the case of the plaintiffs did not come within the per-view of that act; but that if the injuries complained of really had been sustained, the remedy for part of them, at least, was at common law. On the trial, claims for damages of two kinds were submitted to the jury; one founded upon the alleged injuries to the pier; the other upon the occupation of the plaintiffs\u2019 land, for a canal and tow-path. The first is clearly not embraced by the act referred to, which provides a remedy for damages done to <em>land, mills or other water works, </em>by <em>the </em>swelling <em>of the </em>water of the river. A bridge, it will not be pretended, comes within the description of a mill, or other water works. Nor is it <em>land, </em>or taxable as such for raising county rates and levies. <em>Permanent Bridge Company </em>v. <em>Frailey, </em>13 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>422. The alleged injury, moreover, was not the direct and immediate consequence of the works of the defendants. The injury is ascribed to a sluice left in the dam and an unusually high freshet, caused by heavy, rains, which produced an extraordinary flood of water through it, in consequence of which the pier was undermined and cracked. Ordinary freshets had done no injury, but the extraordinary one of <em>December, </em>1829, produced the mischief. These facts present a case of consequential damage, for which at common law the remedy would be an action on the case. The act of assembly was intended to provide a remedy only for those injuries which were the necessary and immediate result of the construction of the works of the defendants, leaving it to the common law to redress a.ll injuries which were not embraced by the statute. <em>Shrunk </em>v. <em>The Schuylkill Navigation Company, </em>14 <em>Serg. &amp;. Rawle, </em>71, 83. <em>Chesnut Hill and Spring House Turnpike Company </em>v. <em>Rutter, </em>4 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>6. <em>The Schuylkill Navigation Company </em>v. <em>Thoburn, </em>7 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>411.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b17-8\">If then the plaintiffs have sustained an injury for which they have redress, they have mistaken their remedy in proceeding under the act of assembly. But there is no redress for the grievance complained of. The ninth section of the act incorporating the bridge company declares expressly, that they shall not injure, stop, or interrupt the navigation of the river. Hence it follows, that if in order to preserve the navigation of the river, it became necessary to injure the bridge, the defendants had a right to do so, and the damage sustained is <em>damnum absque injuria.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b18-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>2. The second reason assigned for a new trial involves a question of considerable importance. It resolves itself into two propositions. <em>First, </em>Is a corporation dissolved by repeated neglects to elect officers and to comply with the other requisitions of the act authorising the grant of a charter of incorporation <em>1 Second, </em>If the corporation be dissolved, can its dissolution be taken advantage of in this proceeding, and under the pleadings in this cause 1 In considering the first proposition, it is necessary to look to <em>the origin, </em>progress, and present condition of corporations. This is said to be the age of <em>improvement, </em>and particularly of <em>internal improvements, </em>and if so, the law must keep pace with the general progress of society. The doctrine to be found in the English books prior to the Revolution, has reference to a species of corporations then most usually existing, <em>viz., </em>municipal <em>corporations; </em>but there is a wide difference between corporations established for the government of towns, and private corporations established for the purposes for which the plaintiffs were incorporated. It is to municipal corporations that <em>Blackstone </em>refers (2 <em>Bl. Com. </em>37,) when he speaks of corporations as franchises. Of these corporations, it is said by <em>Domat </em>(452), that \u201c their design is to provide some good that is useful to the public.\u201d All the foreign adjudications have favoured corporations on the ground, that through their instrumentality, the people regained from the crown some portion of those rights of which it had possessed itself. If the franchise ceased, it reverted to the crown, which was thus strengthened against the people. Here, on the contrary, the people are the only legitimate depository and source of power. Whatever is given to an association of individuals, is so much abstracted from the <em>rights </em>of the cjtizen, and when these rights are forfeited, from any cause, they revert to the community at large. A different reason existing, a different law must be the result. It is true that Chief Justice Marshall, in the case of <em>Dartmouth College </em>v. <em>Woodward, </em>4 Wheat. 518, said, \u201c that, the public benefit supposed to be derived, is such a sufficient consideration for the grant of corporate privileges, that when such a grant is made it is considered in the nature of a contract and cannot be revoked.\u201d Yet the accuracy of this doctrine, with the utmost deference to the high source from which it emanated, may be doubted. It seems to have been adopted without due regard to the distinction already adverted to. This case, however, decides nothing more than that a corporation for <em>literary and scientific purposes, </em>cannot be deprived of any thing strictly belonging to it. The policy of this country is to restrain, not to enlarge, corporate rights. <em>Beattie </em>v. <em>Lessee of Knowler, </em>4 <em>Peters, </em>152. In <em>England, </em>on the other, hand, the courts adopting the views of Sir. <em>James MLntosh, </em>that the revival of order, security, industry, trade and the arts, were attributable to the grants made by, or extorted from feudal tyrants to free cities and towns, from which all the free and regular government which succeeded the prostration of the civilization and science of the Roman empire proceeded, pursued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>a different policy, and extended the circle of corporate privileges as widely as possible ; much more so than it would be expedient to do here. The defendants do not ask that any thing properly belonging to the plaintiffs shall be taken from them; they merely ask that they shall be confined to the path prescribed by the law. They aver, that under the act by which the plaintiffs were created, there were certain conditions precedent to the grant of the charter, and certain conditions subsequent, necessary to be complied with, in order to secure a continuance of their corporate privileges. Bridge companies are private corporations, created partly for the accommodation of the public, but mainly for the private emolument of the stockholders. They are permitted to take toll from citizens who are travelling, and their conduct should therefore be strictly guarded. To entitle the corporation in question <em>to </em>perpetual succession, many things were necessary to be done on their part, and among others, they were bound to elect their officers annually, at the time, in the manner, and after giving the notice prescribed in the act. (The different sections of the act incorporating the plaintiffs were here referred to and commented on.) Municipal corporations have been held to be dissolved, even in <em>England, </em>by failure to elect officers on the charter day, when the chief officer was not entitled to hold over, inasmuch as the corporation had no power afterwards to elect one. <em>Angel SpAmes, </em>505. This evil was remedied by the stat. 11, <em>Geo. </em>1. ch. 4. sec. 1. Chancellor Kent has indeed held, that though a corporation be dissolved, its powers cannot be taken from it collaterally, and that this can only be done by legal process. 4 <em>John. Ch. R. </em>313. 5 <em>John. Ch. R. </em>379. But what is a collateral proceeding ? Surely not a suit by the alleged corporation. Under the general issue a corporation plaintiff must prove its existence. <em>Angel &amp; Ames, </em>377. See also 5 <em>Mass. Rep. </em>547. 3 <em>Mass. Rep. 276. </em>12 <em>Mass. Rep. </em>400. 10 <em>Mass. Rep. </em>91. The omission to comply with the requisitions of the act in this case, was clearly a forfeiture or loss of the charter, and the only question is, whether it can be taken advantage of in this proceeding. The vast increase of corporations in <em>Pennsylvania, </em>now calls for a different rule on this subject, from that which at one time might have been deemed sufficient, and on this principle this court has acted. In the case of <em>Bushel </em>v. <em>The Commonwealth Insurance Company, </em>15 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>176, in which it was decided that a writ of foreign attachment would lie against a corporation, Judge Rogers says, <em>\u201c </em>with the multiplication of corporations which has and is taking place, to an almost indefinite extent, there has been a corresponding change in the law respecting them. This change in the law has arisen from a change of circumstances, from that silent legislation by the people themselves, which is continually going on, in a country such as ours, the more wholesome because it is gradual, and wisely adapted to the peculiar situation, wants and habits of our citizens.\u201d Tf it be said that the matter should have been pleaded in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>abatement, according to the case of <em>First Parish </em>in <em>Sutton </em>v. <em>Cole, </em>3 <em>Pick. Rep. </em>245, the reply is, that whenever a plaintiff sues improperly, the defendant can lake advantage of it on the general issue. It is to take advantage of an error in the character or number of defendants, that a plea in abatement is necessary. <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Wallace's ex\u2019r. </em>8 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>53. <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>Ferris, </em>5 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>396. 1 <em>Chitty's Pl. </em>497.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b20-5\">3. It was not the design of the legislature to give to corporations a statutory remedy for injuries done to their property. The third section of the act of 13th of <em>February, </em>1822, vests in the <em>Lehigh </em>Coal and Navigation Company all the rights, privileges, immunities, &amp;c. given by the act of the 20th of <em>March, </em>1818, to Messrs. <em>White, Hauto </em>and <em>Hazard, </em>upon the same terms, and subject to the same duties imposed upon them; and the second section of the latter act provides a remedy for <em>any person or persons </em>whose properly may be injured by the works in contemplation. The plaintiffs cannot bring themselves within the terms of the act, as they do not answer the description of <em>person </em>or <em>persons. </em>When a statute is intended to embrace corporations, as well as natural persons, its usual language is, <em>\u201c if any person or persons, bodies politic or corporate in law,\u201d </em>&amp;c. The omission of these customary words, clearly indicates the intention of the legislature not to extend the provisions of the act to artificial persons.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b20-6\">4. The verdict was erroneous as to the <em>quantum </em>of damages, and the extent of the injury for which they were to be recovered. It makes the defendants pay for a pier which is still substantial and good, and which, according to the evidence, may last many years, as if it were entirely useless, dangerous, and ready to fall down. It is a verdict in anticipation of a total loss, or a claim for a total loss without abandoning the bridge to the defendants. (The counsel here referred to and remarked upon the evidence in support of their views on this point; they also cited <em>The Schuylkill Navigation Company </em>v. <em>Thoburn, </em>7 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>411, <em>for the </em>rule by which damages are to be estimated.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b20-7\">5. The jury ought to have taken into consideration the advantages which the plaintiffs derived from the works of the defendants, as well in the general increase of travelling, as in the profit derived from the contractors, and those employed by <em>the </em>defendants, in crossing and recrossing. The act of assembly expressly declares, that the advantages derived to the owner or owners of the premises alleged to be injured by the improvement of the navigation, shall be taken into consideration in the assessment of damages. That the plaintiffs were benefitted by the works of the defendants, cannot be denied, and if so, that benefit must be considered in a claim for damages, under the provisions of this act. If, on the other hand, the property of the plaintiffs was of such a nature, that it could not possibly be benefitted by the improved navigation of the river, it was not in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>contemplation of the legislature, and injury to it was not provided for, and consequently no proceeding founded upon the act can be maintained to recover damages.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b21-5\"><em>Gibon </em>and <em>J. Sergeant, </em>for the appellees,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AAZ\">(who were requested by the court to confine their argument to the <em>first </em>and <em>fifth </em>points) <em>argued: </em>\u2014 First, That the cases referred to by the opposite counsel, to show that corporate grants are to be strictly construed, establish that position in favour of individuals. This is a case of corporation against corporation, with this difference as to their rights, arising from their relative situations ; that the Bridge Company being in the position in which individuals are usually placed, are entitled to a liberal construction in their favour, and a strict one against the defendants, who are asserting their corporate rights. There are two kinds of wrong which may be done to an individual by a corporation; the one by a rightful, the other by a wrongful act. The first is within the charter powers of the corporation; the last is not. The legislature cannot grant the power to commit the first, without at the same time providing a compensation for the injury inflicted. Where they give no remedy for an act to be done by a corporation, the commission of that act makes the corporation a wrong-doer in respect to the injured party. The legislature, therefore, usually provides a remedy co-extensive with the injury produced by the exercise of the privilege granted. The remedy, thus provided, is for the advantage of the corporation, and granted at their request, to protect them from incessant liability to common law remedies. It is a fair construction of such an act, to extend the remedy to every injury which can be committed by a corporation within the limits of its charter. That an injury has in the present instance been sustained by the plaintiffs, for which they are entitled to some remedy, it is going too far, to deny. On this point, the case of <em>The Chesnut Hill and Spring House Turnpike Company </em>v. <em>Rutter, </em>4 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>6, is conclusive. It differs essentially from the injury complained of in <em>Shrunk </em>v. <em>The Schuylkill Navigation Company, </em>14 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>71, in which it was held, that the owner of a fishery is not entitled to damages for an injury sustained in consequence of erecting a dam across the river, which prevented the fish from passing up the stream. The basis of that decision was, that no man could in point of law be injured, by being deprived of that which did not belong to him. On the contrary, he should be thankful that he has been permitted to enjoy it so long. But the injury complained of in the present case, is of a different character. It is an actual injury to substantial and valuable property, belonging to the Bridge Company ; not to a common property, like a fishery, in which the whole community has equal rights, but in relation to which the owner of the adjoining shore possesses certain advantages arising from the accident of situation. Unlike the owner of a fishery, the Bridge Company have exclusive rights, privileges and property. No one can cross the bridge without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>paying toll, any more than he can pass through the <em>Lehigh </em>canal without paying toll, and if the legislature were to pass an act authorizing that to be done, the defendants would hardly say it was <em>damnum absque injuria. </em>This part of the case is too clear' for furthur argument. Is then the injury sought to be redressed, comprehended within the special provisions of the act of assembly ? If it is, it is the only mode of redress to which the plaintiffs can resort, as they are cut off\u2019 from a common law remedy where a statutory one is given. Act of 21st of <em>March, </em>1806, <em>Purd. Dig. </em>34. The case of <em>The Chesnut Hill and Spring House Turnpike Company </em>v. <em>Rutter, 4 Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>6, strongly supports the affirmative <em>of this </em>proposition. Whatever is authorised by an act of the legislature, is within its remedial provisions. The only safe course is to make the remedy co-extensive with the injury sustained. The second and third sections of the act \u201c to improve the navigation of the river <em>Lehigh,\u201d </em>which must be taken in connection with each other, provide' a remedy for all injuries resulting from the erection of dams, or the inundation of the lands of any person, by swelling the water by means of dams, &amp;c. Under the provisions of this act, the company had a right to erect dams, when and where they pleased, to leave a sluice, and to do many other things, the effect of which would be necessarily injurious to the property of others. But this unquestionable right was coupled with a condition, that they should make an adequate compensation for the damage they might produce, in the manner indicated by the act. As the right was without limitation, so must be the remedy. The injury was the immediate and necessary consequence of the erection of the defendants\u2019 works. Had it not been for the existence of the dam and the sluice, no injury would have taken place. The bridge had stood floods before, which were by no means extraordinary occurrences. They are as regular in our rivers as the rise of the <em>Mississippi </em>or the <em>Nile ; </em>every one takes them into calculation ; in every river there is a low-water mark, to distinguish it from the high-water mark occasioned by freshets. The legislature knew what would be the probable consequence of the construction of the works, for the improvement of the navigation of the <em>Lehigh, </em>and it is impossible they could have intended to grant the right of destroying the bridge, without compensation. Before the grant, the defendants had no right to the river. They take it subject to the condition of making compensation in the manner prescribed by the act. The question of damages may be perplexing, but that is no reason for denying them, if an injury has been sustained. This is one of the chief difficulties of this case, but such difficulties exist in every case, and the jury must get at the standard of damages in the best manner they can. They must consider the matter in some degree <em>prospectively; they </em>must examine witnesses to ascertain as well the injury actually sustained, as that which will probably ensue; and come as near to a just result, as the nature of the case will permit. In actions of slander, the difficulty of determining the exact amount of injury done, is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>infinitely greater, yet this is never urged as a reason why damages should not be given. Why then be so scrupulous in a case like this <em>1 </em>To suppose the legislature intended to confer on the defendants the power to commit such injuries, without at the same time intending to provide a remedy, would be to impute to them th\u00e9 greatest injustice.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b23-5\">5. The charge of the judge was in accordance with the act of assembly. The jury are to take into consideration the advantages which may be derived, and not those which have been derived from the works of the Coal and Navigation Company. The charter to the Bridge Company is a contract between that company and the people, and there is no mode by which the grant can be resumed, or the advantages secured to them taken away, but by a violation of the charter on the part of the company, or by purchase, in the manner pointed out by the act. The advantages which the legislature had in view, when they said they should be taken into consideration in assessing damages, were those of a permanent and substantial character; not temporary and accidental, as these were. The right to take toll was given as a compensation for the use, and wear and tear of the bridge, and it is plain, that its increased use must increase its wear and tear, require additional expense to keep it in order, and accelerate its destruction. It by no means follows from the increase of travelling, that the value of the property is increased. The stock of the <em>Germantown </em>Turnpike Company was once as high as a hundred and nineteen ; it is now below fifty, yet travelling on that road has greatly increased. The same thing may be predicated of many other turnpike roads. His Honour, therefore, did not err in saying, that the advantages arising from an increase of tolls, in consequence of an increase of business produced by the defendants\u2019 works, ought not to be taken into consideration by the jury.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b23-6\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b23-7\">Gibson, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ae\">As the cause is to go to another jury, it is necessary to determine all the points; and haply they are not attended with difficulty. The legislature evidently meant to provide for nothing that was not remediable at'the common law; and on the other hand, it was intended that every common law injury should be redressed by the statutory remedy. A corporation then must be let into the benefit of it, or be left without redress; so that taking an artificial person not to be within the letter of the act, it is clearly within the equity of it, and the statutory provision being remedial, is to be extended to cases in equal mischief. Still it has been insisted, that the corporation plaintiff was dissolved, by having omitted to continue the succession to certain offices supposed to be integral parts of its body. These, however, were supplied with officers <em>de facto, </em>which was undoubtedly sufficient to sustain its existence as to strangers. It is now well understood, that the loss of an integral part, works a dissolution only to certain purposes; the corporate franchise being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>suspended, but not extinguished. An entire dissolution, being the consequence of permanent incapacity to restore the deficient part, never happens where the legitimate existence of the part is not indispensible to a valid election, or other means of reproduction: and here it is perfectly clear that a new election might be had. This principle was asserted for satisfactory reasons in <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Wickham, </em>1 <em>Paige, </em>590; and in <em>Slee </em>v. <em>Bloom, </em>5 <em>Johns. Ch. </em>366, we have the very case. There a corporation was not dissolved by an omission to elect trustees for more than' two years, the members constituting the integral parts having remained <em>hi esse, </em>and continued in office till others were elected ; and had the rule been otherwise, it was held that a forfeiture of the charter for abuse or neglect of its franchise, must be declared by process and judgment of law, before the corporation can be treated as defunct. Still further it was held, in <em>First Parish, </em>in <em>Sutton </em>v. <em>Cole, </em>3 <em>Pickering, </em>245, that the existence of a corporation plaintiff is to be brought in question only by plea in abatement; and .the same view seems to have been taken by a majority of the judges in <em>Monumoi </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>1 <em>Mass. R. </em>159, Certainly the matter must he put in issue by such el plea, or at least one which denies the whole declaration; for pleading over specially to the merits, as was done here, clearly admits the plaintiff\u2019s capacity to sue. On all these, grounds, then, the point of corporate existence was sufficiently established.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-6\">The principle involved in the exception, that the verdict is against law and the evidence, though perfectly plain in itself, is more doubtful in respect of its application to the facts. The defendant had-the same right to erect the dam at the particular place, that a proprietor has to erect a dam on his own land; and-if chargeable with no want of attention to its probable effect, is not answerable for consequences which it was impossible to foresee and prevent. Where a loss happens exclusively from an act of Providence, it will not be pretended that it ought-to be borne by him whose superstructure was made the immediate instrument of it. Piad the timbers of this dam been torn from its foundation by the violence of a flood, and carried with irresistible force against the bridge, the defendant could have been made liable but by proof that the timbei\u2019s had been left exposed without proper fastening, during the season of high water, and ice, when such an event was to be expected. It will be seen, therefore, that the concurrence of negligence with the act of Providence, where the mischief is done by flood or storm, is necessary to fix the defendant with liability. I have(found no case illustrative of this principle where the loss was occasioned jby water, but it is plainly established by those in which the agent was fire. For instance, an action oh the case lies oh the custom of the realm, against the master of a house, if a fire, accidentally kindled in it, consume the house or goods of another; and this, though it be kindled without the knowledge of the master, and by a servant, guest, or any one else, who has entered by his consent. 1 <em>Rol. </em>1. 1. 25. 3 <em>Lev. </em>359. 1 <em>Salk. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>319. It would be otherwise, however, if the fire were kindled by lightning. In <em>Turbervil </em>v. <em>Stamp, </em>1 <em>Salk. </em>13, the distinction is perhaps more intelligibly put. To an action on the custom of the realm, for negligently keeping fire in a close, by which the plaintiff\u2019s grass was burnt in an adjoining close, it was objected that the custom extends only to fire in the house which is within the party\u2019s power : but it was not allowed ; \u201c for the fire in his field,\u201d it was said, \u201c is his fire, as well as that in his house; he made it, and must s.ee that it does no harm, p'r answer the damages if it does. Every man must use his own so as not to hurt another ; but if a sudden storm had risen which he could not stop, it was a matter of evidence, and he could have shewn it.\u201d <em>(S. C. Skinner, </em>681, and <em>Comyn\u2019s Rep. </em>32.) From motives of sympathy for the unfortunate master of a house in which a fire has originated, actions on the custom are abolished by the stat. 6 <em>Ann, </em>c. 31; but that there was nothing local or peculiar in the custom, is shewn by <em>Clay\u2019s case, (Cro. Eliz. </em>10,) in which it being mooted whether a man who shoots at a fowl and fires his own house, by which that of his neighbour is consumed, be liable on the custom, it was answered, that he is not, but that he is liable in an action on the case generally, for the injury is the same whether the mischance be by negligence or misadventure. The ground work of the common law principle seems to be, that some degree of negligence is imputable in every case of accidental fire, produced by human means; and it is universally just that a loss shall be borne by him whose'act contributed to it. In the case at bar then, it will be for the jury to inquire whether the defendant used all proper precaution to prevent consequential injury. It would seem the river is 'between five and six hundred, feet in breadth ; that the bridge is supported by three piers; that in the-dam placed between eighty and a hundred feet above it, a chasm was left for the passing of rafts, which directed the volume of the water against the centre pier; and that this chasm was thus left for at least six months during the season of rain and ice when high floods are expected to prevail. It will become a question depending on a due consideration of these facts, whether danger to a pier thus exposed, was not to be apprehended, and whether the agents of the defendant were not bound to inquire into the nature of its foundation, and every circumstance <em>that </em>might conduce to adjust estimate ojjtjjg.risk. It will be worthy of inquiry, too, whether the duration of the exposure was not unnecessary and unreasonable, and whether the construction of the body'of the dam, ought not to have immediately preceded the permanent provision, if any were intended, for the accommodation of those who should prefer to use the bed of the river. Should the defendant be found delinquent in these respects, compensation will be made in damages; the measure of which, however, ought not to be the entire cost of a new pier (the standard assumed by the jury in the present instance) unless the old one should be found altogether worthless. But the evidence is strong to shew that it may last not only many years, but as long as if its foundation had not been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>disturbed, the effect of the current being to fill up the excavation, and rather to repair the injury, than increase it. Concurring then with the judge who tried the cause, that the damages are excessive, we feel ourselves bound to direct another trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-3\">Judgment reversed and a new trial awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
