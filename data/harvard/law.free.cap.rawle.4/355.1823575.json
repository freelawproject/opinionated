The defendants below filed a special plea, to which the plaintiff below replied specially, and the defendants demurred specially to the replication, assigning various causes of demurrer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b355-13\">The District Court gave judgment oil the demurrer in favour of the plaintiff below, and the defendants sued out a writ of error.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b355-14\">The cause was argued upon the questions arising upon the pleadings; but this court having given no opinion on them, it is unnecessary to enlarge the report by stating them.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b355-15\"><em>P.

The case at bar is an action of trespass <em>vi et armis, </em>in which, on a demurrer, the court gave judgment for the plaintiff It is therefore necessary before final judgment, that the damages should be assessed by a jury. But until final judgment, a writ of error docs not lie. <em>Metcalf\u2019s Case, </em>11 <em>Co. </em>40. <em>Russel </em>v. <em>Pratt, </em>1 <em>Leonard, </em>193. <em>Lilly\u2019s Entries, 57. </em>We have been requested to give an opinion on the points <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>raised <em>by the </em>demurrer, but this we do not feel ourselves at liberty to do. A writ of error does not remove the record, where final judgment has not been rendered. <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Ingoldsby, </em>2 <em>Ld. </em>Raym, 1179, and <em>Canning </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>2 <em>Ld. Raym. </em>1531. That the court is bound to quash the writ of error, also appears from the case of <em>Rejindoz </em>v, <em>Randolph, </em>2 <em>Strange, </em>834, <em>Vice </em>v. <em>Burton, </em>2 <em>Strange, </em>891. If the parties are put to any inconvenience by the delay, it cannot be avoided. The plaintiff might have had his damages assessed, notwithstanding the writ of error, or the writ would have been quashed at an earlier day.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">Writ of error quashed,</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
