If notice of special matter to this effect had been given, and evidence in support of it, I should be of opinion, that the plaintiffs could not recover. But as the defendant gave the mortgage as a fund to raise money to pay the notes, the mere inability to pay or raise the money, could not be evidence of fraudulent concealment. I however think that the point could not fairly arise, under the notice of special matter.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b29-11\"><em>Broom </em>and <em>Binney </em>for the plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"As\">The bond, the mortgage and the agreement, by which <em>Pray </em>stipulated <em>to </em>take up the notes of MCrelish, bearing the same date, executed at the same time and relating to the same subject-matter, constitute one'instrument. They provide, that as the notes shall become due, they shall be taken up by <em>Pray </em>and delivered to <em>MCrelish. </em>The object of the arrangement was, not to enable <em>Pray </em>to raise money by means of the mortgage, for the purpose of paying the notes, but that he should pay them out of his own funds, and be ultimately secured by the mortgage. The mortgaged premises could not have been looked to as the source from which payment was to be made, for the notes were to be taken up as they became due, and the last of them was to become due before the 1st of <em>November, </em>1822, while the bond was not to become due until one year from the 31st of <em>August, </em>1822, and no procedure could be had upon the mortgage until the expiration of a year and a day from that period. The fund, therefore, could not be realized until after the notes were payable. If the object had been to raise money on the property, there would have been no occasion to make <em>Pray </em>part of the machinery of the arrangement. The money could have been raised without his intervention, and would have passed immediately into the hands of <em>MCrelish; </em>nor was he under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>any obligation arising from his debt for tallow, which was the consideration of the notes, to secure <em>Pray </em>by a bond and mortgage. The object of <em>MCrelish </em>in giving those securities, was to preserve his credit, by providing against the dishonour of his notes. In no other manner could he derive any benefit from the arrangement. <em>M\u2018Crelish, </em>at the time the bond and mortgage were given, owed <em>Pray </em>nothing. The notes had been passed away, were in the hands of various holders, and had not become due. <em>MCrelish, </em>therefore, could gain nothing by giving a security merely to <em>Pray, </em>and he was under no obligation to do so. The introduction of the note holders or the assignees of <em>Pray, </em>does not alter the case, as they derive title through him, and have no other rights than his. The true construction of the agreement then is, that the notes were to be taken up as they, from time to time, became due, in order to save the credit of <em>MCrelish, </em>and enable him to go on with his business. To go back to the original consideration of the notes, and insist that it was the duty of <em>MCrelish </em>to give the mortgage to secure the debt for tallow, is an error. There was no reason why this debt should be preferred. 'The punctual payment of the notes alone could have led him to the \u00bfarrangement, and the failure on the part of <em>Pray </em>to perform the condition on which the mortgage was given, was in. its consequences, ruinous to him. It was not an injury which could be made up in \u00a1damages. Time, therefore, was of the essence of the contract, and .did not admit of compensation. Wherever time is material, the act \u00a1stipulated to be performed, must be performed within the time prescribed, or the contract is vacated, <em>Bennett </em>v. <em>Lynch, </em>1 <em>John. Ch. R. </em>370. Here nothing was done by <em>Pray </em>in fulfilment of his part of the contract. Not a note has been taken up either by him or his assignees; on the contrary, the <em>Bank of the United States, </em>the holders .of oneof them, have proceeded to judgment on it, and thus bound up all <em>M\u2018Crelish\u2019s </em>other property. Not a step has been taken to entitle <em>Pray </em>to come into a court of equity, and ask a specific performance .of the agreement. Equity would not permit him to enforce the mortgage, leaving it entirely uncertain whether <em>M\u2018Crelish </em>will ever derive any advantage from it. If he is bound to do anything to entitle himself to the benefit of the mortgage, equity will never decree specific performance, unless he does what he is bound to do. 1 <em>John. Ch. R. </em>282.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b30-6\">Instead of charging the jury that the failure of <em>Pray </em>to take up the notes as they became due, was a forfeiture of his right to avail himself of the mortgage, the court below refused even to submit the question of time to the jury, instructing them that the payment of the notes was only part of the consideration of the mortgage, and that the injury sustained by <em>M-Grelish, </em>in consequence of their non-payment, might be compensated by damages. This was clearly not a .case of divided consideration and part performance. <em>M\u2018Crelish </em>was to get nothing but the punctual payment of his notes. This was the .single, undivided consideration. No one cap-be insensible of the im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>portance it is to a trader to have his notes' punctually taken up. If a single one remains unpaid, his credit is gone; he is ruined, and it is impossible to estimate the damage. If they are paid immediately after they become due, the evil is not cured, and the dishonour of one is as disastrous in its consequences, as that of twenty. Where the breach of an agreement, at the prescribed time, frustrates all the designs of the party, time is of the essence of the contract and admits of no compensation. If the notes had been lying over when the mortgage was given, the case might have presented a different aspect; but as it was, to leave a single note unpaid at maturity, destroyed the whole arrangement. In what situation is <em>Ml Crelish </em>placed, if <em>Pray, </em>or his assignees can recover, in the present state of things <em>1 </em>His estate is taken from him, and his notes are still outstanding, and he may be sued on all of them, as he has already been on one. If the note holders have any existence in the cause, their conduct has destroyed their claim. How can they ask for the benefit of this security, when they have permitted JkZ\u2018 <em>Crelish </em>to be dishonoured \u2014 and one of them has actually proceeded-to judgment against him <em>1 </em>But the security was evidently not intended to enure to the benefit of the note holders.\u2014 The bond could not be rendered available, until the expiration of nearly a year, and the mortgage not until a year and a day after the bond became due, and in the mean time, the notes were to be taken up by <em>Pray.-. </em>The note holders had nothing to do with the security. It was given for the ultimate security of <em>Pray, </em>who was to pay them out of his own funds. They cited <em>Mackey </em>v. <em>Brownfield </em>13 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>239. <em>Bennett </em>v. <em>Lynch, </em>1 <em>John. Ch. R. </em>370. 1 <em>Fonb.

There is nothing to prevent suits from being instituted upon them, or an execution from being issued upon the judgment already obtained on one of them. The want of equity in attempting to recover upon the mortgage, without taking a single step towards a compliance with any of the conditions on which it was given, is top palpable to be countenanced If this court separate the condition from the bond itself, the consequences will be frightful; <em>M\u2018Crelish </em>loses his property and may nevertheless be compelled to pay the notes. If by a future surrender of the notes, a release of the judgment and indemnity for the injury sustained, full justice can be done under .the contract, it must be on another trial, and of course, this, judgment must be reversed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b31-8\">If when <em>Pray </em>received the mortgage, he intended not to pay the notes, he perpetrated a gross fraud, and of course, there can be no recovery on an instrument thus obtained. It was of the utmost con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>sequence, therefore, to <em>M\u2018CreIish, </em>to shew that when the mortgage was given, <em>Pray </em>either misrepresented Or concealed his situation, and for this purpose it was necessary <em>to </em>shew what his actual situation was; but the court below refused to charge the jury on this point, as the defendant\u2019s counsel requested, on the ground that under the notice of special matter given in the cause, such a defence could not be set up. This defence had nothing to do with the notice of special matter. The defendant had a right to any inference he could draw to the jury, from the evidence before them. The object of such a notice is not to cripple and restrain the effect of evidence already given, but to prevent the introduction, by surprise, of evidence, which the plaintiff is not prepared to rebut. The defendant had a right to shew from the evidence, that <em>Pray, </em>by concealment, trick, or fraud,' had induced <em>M\u2018Crelish </em>to enter into the arrangement. The law is well settled that if the court charge in such a manner as to deprive a party of the benefit of such a charge as ought to have been given, it is error; and this was done by the court below in the present instance.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b32-6\"><em>T. Sergeant </em>and <em>Chauncey </em>for the defendants in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Acn\">One fact lies at the foundation of this case, which must have a material influence on its decision. The notes to secure the payment of which the mortgage was executed, were given for the <em>bona fide </em>debt of <em>M\u2018Crelish, </em>who being largely indebted to <em>Pray </em>for tallow, gave his notes for five thousand dollars, and paid the residue in cash. These notes <em>Pray </em>had discounted, and to secure the ultimate payment of them, the mortgage was given. It was nothing more then, than the ordinary case of a debtor giving a security for his own debt, or ratber <em>providing </em>a fund out of which it should be paid. The mortgaged premises were proved on the trial to be worth but six thousand dollars, and were subject to two other mortgages, amounting to two thousand six hundred dollars, so that the fund was insufficient for the purpose for which it was designed. The mortgage was, from its nature, assignable, and <em>Pray </em>having assigned it for the purpose of raising a fund for the payment of the notes, the plaintiffs below, who are his assignees, come into court upon the mortgage, in order to apply the proceeds to the purpose for which it was assigned. The action, therefore, is for the benefit of the note-holders, who are the real plaintiffs, and the court will consider the real parties as well\u00bfas the equity of the case. If, as is contended on the other side, the agreement controls the mortgage, it does not follow that the mortgage is vacated, if the notes have not been taken up at the day mentioned in the agreement. The agreement consisted of three parts. 1st.\u2014 An acknowledgment by the mortgagee, accepted by the mortgagor, that the mortgage was given to secure the payment of the notes. 2d. \u2014A covenent on the part of the mortgagee, that he would take up the notes as they became due, and deliver them to the mortgagor. 3d. \u2014 A covenant to indemnify the mortgagor against alj claims found<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>ed upon the notes. The leading consideration of the whole arrangement, was to provide a fund for the note-holders. All the others were subordinate to it. Indemnity to <em>MCrelish </em>was not, as the opposite argument supposes, the leading consideration. Properly speaking, it was not any part of the consideration, but rather an independent, personal covenant, not on technical, but substantial grounds. Personal indemnity is sometimes better than real security, and <em>M\u2018Crelisk </em>might have preferred it, but if it fails, it does not give him the right to take back the mortgage, unless there is an express stipulation to that effect, which was not the case. The agreement was not a defeasance of the mortgage, nor is there a word in it which goes to invalidate it, if the notes should not be taken up as they become due. The*, covenant of indemnity, negatives such an idea. To consider the mortgage as vacated in the event of the notes remaining unpaid, is to defeat the very object for which it was given. If <em>M'Crelish </em>had paid the notes himself, it would have been a different matter ; but no court has ever declared a contract like this void in consequence of the failure of a collateral covenant. To argue that there can be no recovery of the fund provided for the payment of the notes, until the notes have been paid, is to require an impossibility. The very object in putting the mortgage in suit, is to obtain the means of carrying the arrangement into effect. It cannot be done except through the medium of the mortgage, yet the defence would take from the plaintiffs below, the only means by which the agreement can be executed. The same answer may be given to the position taken on the opposite side, that supposing it was not necessary under the agreement, that the notes should be taken up as they became due, they must at all events be paid and surrendered before the institution of a suit upon the mortgage. If the plaintiffs had received the fund, the notes would have been paid and surrendered, but without the fund provided for their payment, how can they pay them ? The fund is required for the payment of the notes, and of course they cannot be tendered until the fund is rendered available. If, however, <em>M\u2018Crelisk </em>has any equitable claim to receive the notes before judgment is obtained on the mortgage, that obstacle may easily be removed. The plaintiffs are now ready to surrender the notes on obtaining judgment on the mortgage. Where there is a legal 'objection, it must be removed before the institution of a suit; where it is an equitable one, it may be removed at any time, even during the trial. This is a well settled distinction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b33-6\">As for the delay of the payment of the notes beyond the time prescribed in- the agreement, it forms no objection to the plaintiff\u2019s recovery. Time can almost always be compensated. This has become almost an universal rule, and the contrary is the exception. No court of equity ever inflicted a forfeiture for non-compliance at the day. <em>Decamp </em>v. <em>Feay, </em>5 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>323. <em>Bellas </em>v. <em>Hays, Id. </em>427. The defence is not that the debt intended to be secured, is not honestly due, or that it has been satisfied, and in a court of equity a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>defence cannot be set up, except upon some such ground. The defence is merely that the creditor did not take up the notes at maturity, without any attempt to shew that the debtor sustained any damage, or even suffered any inconvenience from the want of a strict compliance with the agreement. If <em>M\u2018Crelish </em>had suffered damage, he might have sued upon the covenant, even before the mortgage became due, and he may now sue if he thinks he is injured. There was no failure of the consideration of the mortgage, for it was given to secure the payment of a debt, and the debt has not been paid. If it had been paid by <em>MCrelish, </em>the consideration would have failed. In equity, the rule for the construction of covenants, is the same as at law. There is no difference in <em>the </em>manner in. which they are treated. The meaning of the parties at the time the covenant was entered into, must govern, and this meaning can only be collected from the language they have used. But here the court is called upon to say wh\u00e1t the parlies have not said, an.d make the covenants mutual and dependant, though the language of the parties is opposed to it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b34-6\">The notice of <em>special </em>matter, was no <em>indication of the </em>defendant\u2019s intention to prove what he afterwards alleged, and he has no reason to complain of the court below, for saying that the defence attempted tobe set up, did not arise upon the notice given. He was not deprived of the benefit of any evidence of which notice was given; no fraud was alleged in the notice, or attempted to be proved on the trial. All the facts stated in the notice, were given in evidence, so far as they could be proved, and thus the defendant had the full benefit of his notice. His error was in attempting to set up a defence which his notice did not cover.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b34-7\">Rogers, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AV\">(after stating the case) delivered the opinion of the court, as follows:\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b34-8\">We agree fully with the court, that this case must be taken divested of all considerations arising from the allegation of fraud. The inability to pay the notes, as they became due, was not evidence of fraud, nor, on the other hand, was fraud fairly inferable from proof of the fact, that at the time the mortgage was executed the property was previously encumbered to an amount which reduced the value of the security below five thousand dollars. The parties must be supposed to have entered into the contract with a knowledge of all the circumstances, and if they intended to insist on fraud, some evidenc\u00e9 should have been given other than the written testimony which was submitted to the jury. If the defendant intended to insist on fraud in fact) it should have been charged in his notice of special matter, otherwise the plaintiff might be taken by surprise. It is not sufficient to allege facts, from which an inference of moral fraud may be drawn, as has been heretofore decided by the court. The object of special notice is to put the plaintiff on his guard, <em>that his </em>attention may be drawn to the defence, on which the defendant relies. There is nothing in this notice by which the plaintiff cbuld be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>apprised that the defendant intended to charge him with fraud. We think with the District Court, that the defendant\u2019s point could not fairly arise under the notice of special matter. This, however, is a minor defect, which might be easily remedied on another trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-4\">The only difficulty arises in the charge of the court, on the three first propositions of the defendant\u2019s counsel, all of which may be properly considered under one head.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">I cannot say that I exactly comprehend the meaning of the court, when they declare, that they consider the payment of the notes but part of the consideration. This is not explained in the charge, and we have to regret that we have not a more full report on this head, as this appears to be made the hinge upon which the whole cause turns. If this had been the case,-when part of the considerations failed and part did not fail, the mortgage would not be void. When a covenant goes only to <em>part </em>of the consideration on both sides, and a breach of such covenant may be paid for in damages, it is an independent covenant, and action may be maintained for a breach 'of the covenant on the part of the defendant, without averring performance in the declaration. 1 <em>Saund. </em>320, <em>note </em>4.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">The bond, and mortgage, and agreement, being executed at the same time, and in reference to the same- subject-matter, must be taken as one covenant. 2 <em>Vern. </em>459, and 17 <em>Sergeant &amp; </em>Rawle, 115. To discover the intention of-the parties concerned, is the chief object, and in effecting this we have not to encounter any technical difficulties. For covenants, &amp;c. are to be construed to be either dependent or independent, of each other, according to the intention and meaning of the parties and the good sense of the case; and technical words should give way to such intention. 1 <em>Saund. </em>320, <em>noted. On the 31st August, </em>1822, the time the agreement was made, <em>MCrelish </em>was indebted to <em>Pray, </em>five thousand one hundred and seventy dollars, for which he had given him his notes, of different dates, different amounts, and payable at different times. It was a business transaction ,\u2022 the ordinary case of debtor and creditor. <em>MCrelish </em>was under no obligation, legal or moral, to give additional security for payment of the money due. We are then to seek for the motive which induced <em>MCrelish </em>to give <em>Pray, </em>or if you please, <em>the holders of the notes, </em>such security for the money,- and this reason, which forms the consideration of the contract, is given in the agreement itself. <em>M'-Crelish </em>agrees to give <em>to Pray the mortgage </em>and bond in question, and the sum of one hundred and seventy dollars and forty cents, in consideration whereof <em>Pray </em>stipulates that he will pay off and take up all the notes, as they become due, and deliver the same to <em>MCrelish. </em>It is not denied that <em>M\u2018 Crelish </em>performed all his part of the contract to the letter; that is, he gave his bond and mortgage, and paid the money, according to contract. The plaintiff sues out a <em>scire facias </em>on the mortgage, which is in substance calling on the defendant to shew cause why the property should not be sold for payment of the notes, which it was intended to secure, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>single question will be, whether the plaintiff has performed his part of the contract. Are the covenants, in the agreement, conditions, and dependent, in which the performance of one depends on the prior performance of the other, and therefore, till the prior condition be performed, the other party is not liable to an action on his covenant ? <em>Kingston </em>v. <em>Preston, </em>referred to in 2 <em>Doug. </em>689. Or are they mutual and independent, where either party may recover damages from the other,for the injury he may have received by a breach of the covenants in his favour, and where it is no excuse for the defendant to allege a breach of the covenants on the part of the plaintiff? That no particular words are required to create either a covenant or a condition, is perfectly clear; and it is also immaterial in point of construction, whether the clause be placed in the instrument prior or posterior to others. There are indeed some words, on which conditions precedent usually arise, such as, for instance, <em>ita quod, sub conditione, quod si contingat. Lock </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>1 Str. 569.\u2014S. C. 8 <em>Mod. </em>40. <em>Peeters </em>v. <em>Opie, </em>2 <em>Saund, </em>350. <em>Co. Lit. </em>204 <em>a, </em>203 <em>c, </em>2 <em>L. Ray. </em>766. <em>Com. Dig. title, Condition. </em>And in some instances the words shall b'e construed to be both a covenant and a condition; as if one leases for years by indenture, provided always, and it is covenanted and agreed, that the lessee shall not alien. This is a condition by force of the provision, and a covenant by force of the other words; <em>Co. Lit. </em>203, <em>b. </em>2 <em>Mod. </em>74. 2 <em>Co. </em>72, <em>a. Cromwell\u2019s case. Cro. E. </em>242, <em>Simpson </em>v. <em>Tetterell. </em>But the courts at the present day disregard technicalities, and notice such words so far only as they disclose, and are evidence of the intention of the contracting parties. <em>Platt on 'Covenants, </em>72. It is said, that this is a suit brought by the assignees of <em>Pray, </em>under the special clause in his assignment for the benefit of the holders of the notes. It may be safely admitted, that they stand in the place of <em>Pray, </em>but surely no person can \u2022 contend, that they are in a better situation. Whether the parties to the agreement were particularly anxious about the security of the holders of the notes, admits of doubt. <em>Pray </em>had an eye to his eventual liability, in case the drawer should be unable to take up the notes at maturity. This was bis motive; but be this as it may, the court would give the language of the agreement an extended signification, so as to embrace the holders of the notes, and give them the advantage of the security. I am willing to allow the plaintiffs the benefit of the position, that the parties are substantially the holders of the notes. It is in truth a contest for the fund, between different classes of creditors, and in this view equally meritorious in the eye of the court. Still the question recurs, what is the meaning of that part of the contract, in which <em>Pray </em>agrees to pay off and take up all the said notes as they become due, and deliver the same to <em>M\u2018Crelish. </em>It is not pretended that <em>Pray, </em>or any other person, paid the notes as they became due. On the contrary, the notes were regularly protested for non-payment, and on one of them suit was brought and prosecuted to judgment. It is not alleged that the notes were delivered to <em>M\u2019Crelish, </em>nor was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>there an offer to deliver them, until the time of trial. It is, however, said, that the mortgage, &amp;c. were given to raise money for the purpose of paying the notes as they became due, and that the failure in payment arose from a deficiency in the value of the property. But this is said without any evidence whatever, and in opposition to the common sense of the transaction. I can perceive no motive which could induce <em>Or dish </em>to make such an arrangement. If the intention was to raise money on the mortgage, so as to meet the notes when they became due, this could have been as well efleeted, for any thing that we know, by <em>MCrelish </em>as by Pray, and that without the risk to which he must be exposed by placing in the hands of <em>Pray </em>the whole amount raised on the mortgage, which <em>Pray </em>might, or might not, faithfully apply to the objects of the trust. They could not have looked to a sale of the property, as that could not be done under the mortgage, until after all the notes became due. Besides, if such was the intention, as has been contended, it does not appear that any effort was made to raise money on the security of the mortgage. If we understand this agreement as providing <em>Pray </em>with a real security, and- as securing to <em>MCrelish </em>the punctual payment as they became due, we have considerations presented sufficiently powerful to account for the arrangement. <em>M'Crelish's </em>credit depended on the payment of the notes at the day. The dishonour of the bills necessarily destroyed his credit. And so certain was this effect produced, that <em>M\u2018Crelish </em>shortly after assigned for the benefit of his creditors.' To prevent this, was the principal reason for entering into the contract. But, it is said, that in equity, time is not material, and in general it is not. But when it is the obvious intent to make time material, equity will not relieve, and that is the case here. The injury arising from a non-payment at the day, of these negotiable securities, it may be difficult to estimate, nay, in some instances, impossible. In a mercantile community, punctuality is of the utmost importance, and the covenant might be viewed in relation to the subject-matter, and under all the circumstances attendant upon it. Although the agreement contains a stipulation for an indemnity, this w\u00e1s intended to give a remedy, when the injury was of such a nature as to require a larger compensation in damages than the amount of the value of the notes. The clause may also be relied on to shew the importance which <em>MCrelish </em>attached to a punctual performance of the contract at the day. It must be borne in mind, that no one of the notes was ever paid, and whether if such a payment had been made, it would have been in part performance of the contract, it is unnecessary to decide. Although it has been intimated', in some of the cases, that time could not be made of the essence of the contract, even by a positive stipulation of the parties, there has been no decision to that effect; but in other, and in later cases, it has been admitted that parties may make time of the essence of the agreement, and whether- they have done so must depend on all the circumstances. 1 <em>Russel, 377; </em>1 <em>Simon &amp; Stuart, </em>590. In <em>Benedict &amp; </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>Lynch, Chancellor Kent, with his usually perspicuity, reviews all the cases in this branch of equity. He adopts the opinion of Lord Loughborough in <em>Lloyd </em>v. <em>Collit, </em>4 <em>Bro. </em>489, who observes, that there is nothing of more importance, than that the ordinary contracts between man and man, which are so necessary in their intercourse with each other, should be certain and fixed, and that it should be certainly known, when a man is bound and when not. There is a difficulty to comprehend how the essentials of a contract should be different in equity and at law. It is one thing to say that time is so essential, that in no case in which the day has.by any means been suffered to elapse, the court would relieve against it and decree performance ; the conduct of the parties, inevitable accidents, &amp;c. might induce the court to relieve. But it is a different thing to say, the appointment of a day is to have no effect at all, and that it is not in the power of the parties to contract, that if the agreement is not executed at a particular time, they shall be at liberty to rescind. This is not, it is true, the case of an express stipulation to rescind the contract, provided the notes were not taken up and delivered at the day, yet there is no mistaking the intention of the parties to provide for the faithful, literal, and punctual compliance with the contract. It was an object of the greatest importance to <em>MCrelish to </em>preserve his credit, which could only be done by preventing the dishonour of his bills. Had the notes been paid at the day, but not delivered, that would have been a case of a part performance, and the failure to deliver the bills might have been compensated in damages. But not so where there has been an entire failure on the part <em>of the </em>plaintiffs. The principle seems to be firmly established, that time may be a circumstance of decisive importance, but that it may be waived by the conduct of either party; that it is incumbent on the plaintiff, whether at law or in equity, to shew that he has used due diligence in the performance of his part of the contract, or that if he has not, his negligence arose from some just cause, or has been acquiesced <em>in; </em>that it is not necessary for the defendant to shew any particular inconvenience; it is sufficient if he has not acquiesced in the negligence of the plaintiff. It is not pretended that the plaintiffs performed their part of the contract at the time, nor has it been shewn that the negligence arose from any just cause, or that it has been acquiesced in by the defendant. They seek every benefit from the contract, without any thing being done on their part from which <em>MCrelish </em>could receive the slightest possible advantage. His notes have been dishonoured, and he has been compelled to assign his property for the benefit of his creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">Judgment reversed, and a <em>venire- facias de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
