The second section declared that the landowner\u2019s neglect or refusal to comply with the order \u201c after such notice for a period of thirty days as prescribed in \u00a7 1 \u201d should constitute a second misdemeanor punishable by a like fine, and that each succeeding neglect or refusal of thirty days should be similarly punished.

The violation of any lawful city ordinance which prescribed a penalty for its violation was made a misdemeanor. In 1899 (Special Laws of 1899, p. 371) the court of common council was empowered to prescribe penalties. for neglect or refusal to comply with its orders and ordinances made in pursuance of the charter, relative to the repair of sidewalks.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b74-6\">A city ordinance provided as follows: \u201c Section 1. It shall be the duty of owners of lands abutting public highways to level, raise, curb, pave and form, and when necessaiy to repair sidewalks in front of their respective properties whenever ordered so to do in compliance with the charter of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>city. And every owner of lands abutting a public highway who shall neglect or refuse to level, raise, curb, pave and form or repair such sidewalks, in compliance with such order, for thirty days after having been so duly ordered and notified, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall, upon conviction therefor, pay a fine to the treasury of the city of New London of not less than twenty nor more than fifty dollars. Sec. 2. The neglect or refusal of such owner of lands to comply with such order after such notice for a period of thirty days as prescribed in section 1, shall constitute a second misdemeanor and upon conviction thereof such person shall pay a fine in addition to that prescribed in section 1, to the treasury of said city of New London, of not less than twenty nor more than fifty dollars ; and for each succeeding neglect or refusal for each successive period of thirty days thereafter such owner shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and pay to the treasury of said city a fine of not less than twenty nor more than fifty dollars.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b75-6\">The following order was passed by the court of common council on July 18th, 1900: \u201cThat the following named persons, Patrick H.

Hull, </em>Prosecuting Attorney, for the appellee (the State).</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b75-10\">Baldwin, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A-G\">To make an order of the court of common <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>council of New London, for the repair of a sidewalk by the owner of the abutting lands, sufficient to support a criminal prosecution against him for neglecting to obey it, it is necessary that a time should be limited, by reference to which the neglect might be ascertained. The words \u201c may limit,\u201d in \u00a7 26 of the charter, are equivalent to \u201c shall limit.\u201d <em>Slate </em>v. Neuner, 49 Conn. 232, 233. Such a time need not be expressed in the order, however, if it had been previously prescribed by appropriate action of the court of common council.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">The ordinance upon which the present prosecution is immediately based, in \u00a7 1 imposes a penalty of \u2022120 for a neglect or refusal to repair, in compliance with such an order, for thirty days after due notice of it; and in \u00a7 2 a like penalty for a neglect or refusal \u201c to comply with such order after such notice for a period of thirty days as prescribed in section 1 \u201d (this being declared to constitute \u201c a second misdemeanor and also \u201cfor each succeeding neglect or refusal for each successive period of thirty days thereafter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">Under the terms of \u00a7 1, construed according to the strict rule applicable to penal statutes and ordinances, no misdemeanor would be committed if the repairs were begun within the thirty days prescribed, and carried on in good faith, although not completed until that period had elapsed. But it seems impossible to give \u00a7 2 any other meaning than that, unless they be completed within the same thirty days, the owner would become guilty of a second misdemeanor. This lays down an iron-bound rule for every case, whatever may be the nature or extent of the repairs ordered. It would be competent for the court of common council to require work to be begun in thirty days. To exact its completion within that time, under all circumstances, without exception, under penalty of a criminal prosecution, is unreasonable; and \u00a7 2 is therefore void. The invalidity of the provision as to the \u201csecond misdemeanor\u201d destroys the foundation for any succeeding one. It leaves, however, \u00a7 1 in full force. The constitution of the first misdemeanor may well stand by itself, and is unaffected by the failure of the later ones.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-8\">The order was therefore not insufficient for want of a limita<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>tion of time. Construed with reference to the ordinance, those to whom it was addressed were directed to commence the repairs within thirty days from the service of notice upon them; and it is not for them to-complain that no time was set for the completion of the work.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">But on another ground the order was insufficient to support' the prosecution. The abutters were ordered to put the sidewalks \u201c in good and sufficient repair, free from defects, and safe and convenient for travel.\u201d They were entitled to more certain directions as to the \u201c manner \u201d in which the repairs were to be made. It was not enough to describe these by the results to be accomplished by their completion. Either some particular mode of effecting them should have been prescribed, or some proper person designated to whom the owners might go for instruction or approval. The Criminal Court of Common Pleas, therefore, erred in instructing the jury that the order was passed in compliance with the charter. <em>State </em>v. Clarke, 69 Conn. 371.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">The invalidity of the order renders it unnecessary to consider the claim of the defendant, that it is contrary to the provisions both of the constitution of Connecticut and of that of the United States to require owners of lands abutting on a street to repair sidewalks which have been once properly constructed.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-8\">There is error*, and the cause is remanded to the Criminal Court of Common Pleas, with directions to dismiss the information.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-9\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
