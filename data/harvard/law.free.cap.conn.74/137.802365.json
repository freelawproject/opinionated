The said Charles Talbot and the said Christopher Talbot, referred to in clause five of the will, were brothers of the deceased of the full blood. The testator left him surviving no wife, child, adopted child, or representatives of children, and no brother or sister or representatives thereof, excepting the said Christopher Talbot and the children of said Charles Talbot named in the succeeding paragraph. 18. The said Charles Talbot predeceased the testator and died on the 15th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>day of March, 1896, leaving lawful issue him surviving, .to wit: Charles J. Talbot of Notting Hill Gate, London, England; William Talbot of Emsworth, Hampshire, England; John Talbot of Gaylordsville, Litchfield County, Connecticut; Henry J. Talbot of Faringdon, Berkshire, England; Frederick D. Talbot of Herne Hill, London, England; Mary Elizabeth Smith, wife of William Smith, of Islip, Oxford, England; Ann Stancombe, wife of James Stancombe, of Harrow Road, London, England. All of said children are now living and are of age. 19. The said Christopher Talbot survived the testator and is still living. 20. The said John Talbot is a nephew of the testator and was so considered and spoken of by the testator, and he is the person mentioned in the second clause of the will as \u201c my nephew, John Talbot.\u201d 21. The testator, his two brothers, Charles Talbot and Christopher Talbot, and his nephew, John TaLbot, were born in England. Said Charles Talbot resided in England until his death. Said Christopher Talbot has resided in England all his life and still resides there. The children of Charles Talhot, with the exception of said John Talbot, are all unnaturalized aliens residing in England. The said John Talbot is the nearest of kin to the testator residing in the United States. 22. The testator, William Talbot, came to the United States about the time of the war of the rebellion, and resided here until his death. He was naturalized as an American citizen and was a voter in the town of Greenwich. 23. Said John Talbot came to the United States at the age of 18 years, in the year 1869, and became a citizen at the age of 21 years, and now resides at Gaylordsville, in the town of New Milford, and is a voter there. 24. The choses in' action mentioned in paragraphs 5, 8 and 16, consist of notes given to the testator by persons living in said- Gaylordsville. The note for |975 is secured by a mortgage on real estate- situated in said Gaylordsville, which said real estate adjoins the testator\u2019s real estate, on which the said John Talbot now lives, and for many .years has lived. The said testator had no personal property situated in Gaylordsville, except these notes and the above referred to mortgage. 25. The following ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>tions have arisen relative to the construction of certain of the provisions contained in said will, and as to the duty of the plaintiff in the administration of his trust, as follows: First. What is the construction of the residuary clause of the will? Did the testator intend thereby to give to his two brothers therein named, the remainder of the proceeds of the sale of the real estate ordered sold in the preceding paragraph (after paying the legacy to the Methodist Society) and the residue of his personal estate ? <em>Second. </em>Does the provision in the will authorizing, empowering and directing the qualifying executor to sell the homestead, and tenant dwelling No. 2, and to distribute the net proceeds after deducting $200 for the Methodist Church, with the residue of the personalty, in equal shares to the two alien brothers, so affect the character of the property as to allow the nonresident aliens to participate in the proceeds ? Does this constitute a complete equitable conversion? <em>Third. </em>If so, does the provision in favor of Charles Talbot become a lapsed legacy, and if so, what disposition shall be made of that portion of the estate ? <em>Fourth. </em>Is the gift to the two brothers, provided for in the fifth clause, a provision for a class or for individuals? <em>Fifth. </em>Does the death of Charles Talbot, or any other cause, so affect the attempted equitable conversion as to render it ineffective with reference to the said share of Charles Talbot ? And if so, does said share become a lapsed devise and, in that event, does it escheat to the State, or can John Talbot take? <em>Sixth. </em>Does the death of Charles Talbot, or any other cause, so affect said attempted equitable conversion that the entire estate affected thereby is to be regarded as real estate ? And in that event who is entitled to take, if any one ? <em>Seventh. </em>Is John Talbot an heir-at-law of the testator and entitled to participate in the distribution of the intestate estate, if any? <em>Eighth. </em>Is the status of John Talbot fixed by the terms of the will as \u201c nephew \u201d and heir of the deceased, or must he have his right of succession through his father, and if so, can he take at all ? <em>Ninth. </em>Are the issue of said Charles Talbot, deceased, entitled to participate in the distribution of the estate, and if so, to what extent ? <em>Tenth. </em>Are the proceeds of the sale of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>the tenant dwelling number 1, to be considered as real or personal property, for the purposes of distribution ? Does the transaction with John H. Ward et ux. affect this question? <em>Eleventh. </em>Is any portion of the estate intestate, or does the residuary clause contemplate lapses? <em>Twelfth. </em>Does John Talbot take the Gaylordsville notes and mortgage by virtue of the second clause of the will, or in any other way?</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b160-6\"><em>Arthur D. Warner </em>and <em>Frederic M. </em>Williams, for John Talbot.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b160-7\"><em>Frederick C. </em>Taylor, for Christopher Talbot, Elizabeth Talbot et al.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b160-8\">Hamersley, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AR0\">The transaction between Lena Ward and the executor in effect gave to Lena the land devised to her, and settled her claim against the estate for the sum of $300. This settlement was approved by the Court of Probate, and we cannot say from the facts appearing in the record that the claim as first presented against the estate was an unjust claim, within the meaning of the sixth clause of the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-9\">The fourth and fifth clauses of the will treat the real estate therein mentioned as personal property, and the directions to sell create a complete equitable conversion of the land into personal property.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-10\">The fifth clause fairly expresses the intention of the testator to give to his two brothers the residue of his personal property, including the balance of the proceeds from the sale of real estate, mentioned in the fourth clause, after paying the bequest of $200 to the Methodist society of Gaylordsville.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-11\">The bequest to the two brothers, Charles and Christopher Talbot, was one to them individually and not to them as a class. By operation of \u00a7 541 of the General Statutes, the legacy to Charles Talbot was in legal effect a gift to him, and to his issue in case he should not survive the testator; the legacy therefore did not lapse by reason of his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-12\">By the second clause of the will the testator gives to his nephew, John Talbot, \u201call my real and personal property, situated in Gaylordsville, Litchfield county and State of Connecticut.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>In view of the facts appearing in the record, we think the testator intended by \u201c personal property \u201d to include the debts due him from residents of Gaylordsville. These debts appear to be all the personal property he had, except his household furniture and the money in bank mentioned in the inventory. His nephew, John Talbot, was the only one of his relatives who had lived near him, and to whom he made any specific gift. The mortgage debt, which forms substantially the whole of the debts due from residents of Gaylordsville, was secured by mortgage on land adjoining land devised to his nephew, and the intent to give him that mortgage debt in connection with the land adjoining that securing the debt, might be expressed by the phrase \u201c all my real and personal property situated in Gaylordsville.\u201d It is true that ordinarily, and in the absence of any modifying legislation, the <em>situs </em>of a debt follows the person of the creditor. In the case of mortgage debts especially, the residence of the debtor, as well as the place where the mortgage securities are held, have in some jurisdictions been treated for certain purposes as the <em>situs </em>of the mortgage debt. But in common language, a debt is not infrequently spoken of as being property at the residence of the debtor, especially when secured by land there situate. The question before us is not one of legal <em>situs, </em>but of what the testator under the circumstances of this case meant when he spoke of \u201c all my real and personal property in Gaylordsville.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">The personal property remaining in -the hands of the executor for distribution should be divided as follows: 1. The choses in action, to the nephew John Talbot. 2. Two hundred dollars to the Methodist Society of Gaylordsville. 3. One half of the remainder to the brother Christopher Talbot, and the other half, in equal parts, to the children of the brother Charles Talbot.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">The Superior Court is advised to render judgment in accordance with the above opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">No costs will be taxed in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-9\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
