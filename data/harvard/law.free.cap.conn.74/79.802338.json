The par value of its stock was at the time of the making of said will, and had been for many years, $5,000,000; and for many years and at the time of the making of the will aforesaid, it had paid regular yearly dividends of 16 per cent., being less than the amount earned. The excess not used for dividends or in the business of the company was invested in stocks, bonds and other securities. This excess fund stood upon the books of the company as a \u201c Coal Land Renewal Fund,\u201d and as surplus. The purpose of the former fund was to replace coal lands owned by the company which should become mined out, by the purchase of other coal lands. On May 30th, 1895, the Coal Land Renewal Fund stood upon the books of the company at $4,500,000, and the surplus at $4,012,701.08.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b97-7\">At the time of making his will and at the time of his death, the testator was a large bolder of the stock of this company, owning 1,155 shares, and knew of the existence and approximate amount of the funds aforesaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b97-8\">In December, 1900, and January, 1901, substantially all the shareholders in the company, including the society\u2019s committee, sold their shares to J.

Shares in such company are a wasting investment. There are two modes of conducting its affairs. The capital invested in a mine may be gradually paid back to the shareholders in the shap\u00e9 of dividends from the proceeds of working it; or part of these proceeds may be retained, for reinvestment, from time to time, in the purchase of new mines to take the place of the old ones as they become exhausted or unprofitable. Morawetz on Priv. Corp. \u00a7\u00a7 442, 830.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-11\">The Pennsylvania Coal Company adopted the latter policy. It established a large \u201cCoal Land Renewal Fund\u201d and also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>put aside a \u201c Surplus \u201d fund, each of which, in 1901, was nearly or quite as large as its capital stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">The testator contemplated the possibility of a reorganization of the company, and made a certain provision for that contingency. The only mode of reorganization which he had in mind was the creation of one or more companies to succeed to its business and property. There is another mode, by which the corporate organization remains externally the same, but the ownership and control is changed from within, by a transfer of the shares to a new set of shareholders, through their individual but concerted action. Such action was taken by the shareholders of the Pennsylvania Coal Company, and the resolution adopted by the directors was in furtherance of it. The manifest purpose was to enable the purchasers of the stock to continue the business of the corporation upon the same basis of nominal capitalization, but without participation in a considerable portion of the profits previously accumulated. <em>Woodbridge </em>v. <em>Pratt &amp; Whitney </em>Co., 69 Conn. 304, 330. There was, in effect, a liquidation of the affairs of the company, as they had been conducted under the old management.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">The dividend declared from these accumulated profits was not a stock dividend. That mode of distribution was not possible; for the object of the whole transaction was to cut off the old shareholders from any future participation in the concerns of the company. The provisions of the Public Acts of 1889, p. 41, Chap. 72, therefore do not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">Nor was it a cash dividend. It was in terms one consisting of certain specified assets. While the cash which might be on hand at a certain future date was included, its amount was not and could not be stated. The other assets were to be converted into cash ; but this was to be effected by trustees, under an active trust which might endure for a considerable period of time. These trustees were substantially in the position of liquidators. The sums which they might ultimately realize and pay over were uncertain. The beneficiaries of the trust, to whom the payments were to be made, were to receive them not as shareholders in the company, but because they had formerly been shareholders. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>The $10,000 received by the society\u2019s committee is therefore to be regarded as a part of the accumulated property or \u201c floating capital \u201d of the corporation distributed in liquidation, and belongs wholly to the capital of the trust fund. <em>Gifford </em>v. Thompson, 115 Mass. 478; <em>D\u2019Ooge </em>v. <em>Leeds, 176 </em>id. 558, 57 Northeastern Rep. 1025.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">The Superior Court is so advised.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">No costs will be taxed in this court in favor of either party.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
