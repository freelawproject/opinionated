The will is dated April 2d, 1881.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b57-7\">.The following facts are found by the trial court: Mrs. Thomas died August 15th, 1893, .of advanced age. Her son Edward, mentioned in the will, was her only child. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>He died at forty years of age, within eight months after the death of his mother, leaving no child, never having been married; and leaving a will in which S. H. Thresher, the appellant, was named as executor. Stephen B. Meech was appointed administrator with the will annexed of the estate of Mrs. Thomas. His administration account was filed October 19th, 1898, showing a balance on hand for distribution of $36,722.56. George D. Goit, the trustee named in the will, refused to qualify, and the Court of Probate appointed the Second Congregational Society of Norwich, being a duly incorporated ecclesiastical association, to be his successor as trustee of the sum of $1,000 to be deposited in a savings-bank, as directed in the will; and said society duly qualified as such trustee. The court did not appoint a successor to said Coit as trustee to receive and pay over the residue of the estate to the \u201c American Home Missionary Society.\u201d The said ecclesiastical society is the owner and has control of the church edifice in said Norwich known as the Second Congregational Church, of which church' the said Jane G. Thomas was a member and a pew-holder for over thirty years. The said church is the religious organization connected with said society, the latter holding property for the purpose of maintaining public worship in said church and the promotion of church and charitable work in connection therewith. Ever since December 2d, 1870, there has existed a missionary society in connection with said church and ecclesiastical society, organized under the name of \u201c The Ladies\u2019 Home Missionary Society of the Second Gongregational Church,\u201d of which society regular books have been kept, frequent meetings held and officers elected. The work of this missionary society consists in preparing and sending charitable gifts, boxes of clothing, bedding and other articles of necessity, to needy clergymen engaged in preaching the gospel and other home missionary work, usually, although not of necessity, residing in the western States. Said missionary society determines the objects of its charity by selecting one or more whom i.t wishes to assist from a large number of names sent to it and recommended by a charitable so<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>eiety in New York City. Said missionary society is the only society doing work of this kind connected with said church and ecclesiastical society, and was commonly spoken of and known as \u201c The Sewing Society \u201d or \u201c Missionary Society,\u201d by its members and those contributing to it or attending its meetings. The testatrix often worked with the members of said missionary society in preparing said boxes, and was a contributor to its funds and much interested in its work. The American Home Missionary society was formed in the city of New York in the year 1826, for the purpose of establishing and aiding missionary churches in the western part of the United States. Thereafter it was incorporated by the legislature of the State of New York under the name American Home Missionary Society, and under said name existed at the date of the testatrix\u2019s death. Subsequent to her death, and in the year-, its name was changed by the legislature of the State of New York to the name Congregational Home Missionary Society of New York, under which name said corporation now exists, its purpose and business being that for which it was originally organized.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b59-7\">The Court of Probate made the following order for the distribution of Mrs. Thomas\u2019 estate in the hands of the administrator: \u201cThat the said Stephen B. Meech, administrator as aforesaid, pay over and deliver to \u2018 The Second Congregational Society in Norwich \u2019 of said Norwich, as trustee, the sum of one thousand dollars, to be deposited in a savings-bank as directed in the will of said deceased, and the income thereof paid to the Ladies\u2019 Home Missionary Sewing Society connected with said \u2018 The Second Congregational Society in Norwich \u2019; and it is further ordered, that said Stephen B. Meech, administrator as aforesaid, pay over and deliver the rest and residue of said estate to the Congregational Home Missionary Society of New York.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b59-8\">From that order an appeal was taken to the Superior Court by S. H. Thresher, executor of the will of said Edward H. Thomas. \u2022 The reasons of appeal filed in the Superior Court set forth certain grounds for claiming the invalidity of the will, especially as obnoxious to the statute of perpetuities ; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>the invalidity of the two bequests referred to in the order of distribution, and the invalidity of the order as passed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b60-6\">The Superior Court rendered judgment affirming the order of the Court of Probate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b60-7\">The appeal from that judgment to this court assigns various errors, all of which rest upon the failure of the Superior Court to sustain the following claims made by the appellant: 1. The words \u201clawful issue\u201d as used in the third provision of the trust, do not mean \u201cchildren,\u201d and do mean \u201c descendants of every generation.\u201d 2. If said words can be held to mean \u201c children,\u201d then the direction in the same provision of the trust, that the testatrix\u2019s great-grandchildren whose parent may die during the life of her son Edward shall take what the parent so dying would have taken in case of survivorship, is obnoxious to the statute of perpetuities. 3. The words \u201cif my son shall die without issue \u201d in the fourth provision of the trust, refer to his death during the life of the testatrix. 4. The gift in trust for the Ladies\u2019 Home Missionary Society, etc., is void, because a beneficiary is not legally designated, and the object of the charity is not expressed with sufficient certainty. 5. The gift to the \u201cAmerican Home Missionary Society formed in the City of New York in 1826,\u201d cannot be taken by the \u201c Congregational Home Missionary Society of New York; \u201d and in any event the order of the Court of Probate is void, because it directs a payment to the legatee without appointing a trustee for the purpose of receiving the gift from the administrator and paying it over to the legatee. 6. The order directing the payment of $1,000 to the Second Congregational Society of Norwich, is void, because it does not define the objects of the trust.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b60-10\"><em>Seneca S. </em>Thresher, for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b60-11\"><em>Arthur L. Shipman, </em>with whom was <em>Wallace S.

If we assume, without passing on its correctness, that this claim can be sustained, we fail to see how sustaining it affects the real question before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">The first contingency has become impossible by the happening of the second, for one could not happen without the other becoming impossible. There can be no question of the validity of' a bequest of the remainder to these appellees, in case the life tenant dies without issue; and its operation cannot be defeated by the fact that the will also contains a bequest of the remainder to others, in case the life tenant dies leaving issue, whether such other bequest be a valid one or not. It is the happening of the alternative contingency, and not the character of the alternative bequest, that can affect the gifts made to these appellees. These considerations dispose of all the errors based on the first three claims made by the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-8\">In view of the facts found by the trial court, there is really no foundation for the other three claims. They are not seriously pressed by the appellant in his brief, and, we think, do not call for comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-9\">There is no error in the judgment of the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-10\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
