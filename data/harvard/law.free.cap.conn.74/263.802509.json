Sear man, was plaintiff, and the plaintiff in error and the other defendants in error were defendants. The only matter in demand was the right to the sum of $75 on deposit in the defendant bank in the name of \u201cThe Danbury Hat Co., B. W. Seaman, Treasurer,\u201d which sum was claimed by both the plaintiff Mrs. Seaman and the defendant Clark; the defendant bank being willing to pay this sum to the rightful owner, and the other defendant disclaiming. The court, after issues joined and hearing, awarded the $75 to Mrs. Seaman, and rendered judgment accordingly and against the plaintiff in error, and enjoined him from taking further action to obtain said money.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b280-7\"><em>William H.

None but equitable relief was claimed. The matter in demand was $75. The parties were all of Waterbury. The statute which then conferred upon said court its jurisdiction, provided that it should have concurrent jurisdiction with the Superior Court of all actions in which equitable relief only was claimed. Public Acts of 1895, Chap. 181. The Superior Court for New Haven County, with which alone it could have any concurrent jurisdiction, had no equitable jurisdiction in any ease wherein the matter in demand was less than $500. General Stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>utes, \u00a7 774. Upon the Court of Common Pleas was conferred exclusive jurisdiction in all such cases. General Statutes, \u00a7 723. The Superior Court, therefore, could not have taken jurisdiction of this action. No more could the District Court of Waterbury, for its jurisdiction was expressly made concurrent with that of the Superior Court. The Court of Common Pleas alone had jurisdiction. The proceedings in the District Court were therefore void <em>in toto.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">The plaintiff in error has not waived his right to object, nor is his objection made too late. <em>Fowler </em>v. <em>Bishop, </em>32 Conn. 199; <em>Camp </em>v. <em>Stevens, </em>45 id. 92; <em>Chipman </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>59 id. 496.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">There is error, the judgment below is vacated, and the case must be stricken from the docket.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
