At the death of the testatrix in 1888 said Seamen\u2019s Friend Society was empowered by its charter to purchase and receive, property, real and personal, and to hold the same free from taxation, to an amount not exceeding $15,000; but in 1895, and prior to the decease of J, the charter was amended so as to enable the society to receive and hold much more than the amount in question. Upon an appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>by the heirs at law from an order of the Court of Probate directing the trustee to distribute the residue of the estate to said societies, it was <em>held </em>:\u2014</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b603-5\">1. That the limitation of $15,000 in the original charter of the Seamen's Friend Society, was not confined to the exemption from taxation, but applied generally to the society\u2019s capacity to acquire property.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b603-7\">2. That the bequest to said society, being for a lawful, charitable use\u2014 the relief of a certain, definite class of the poor\u2014and carrying an implied power to select the particular persons to be relieved, was valid, even if the society, which was to receive no beneficial interest, were legally incapable of accepting the trust; but that the action of the State had made the society fully competent to receive the legacy and administer the charity long before it became operative in enjoyment, and while it remained uncertain whether anything would be left to be enjoyed.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b603-9\">3. That there was no occasion for the appointment of said society as trustee, no trust existing except by construction of law, and it having become fully capable of holding the fund in the manner directed by the will.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b603-11\">4. That even if it were true that one of the purposes of said society was not charitable, that fact would be immaterial upon an inquiry as to the society\u2019s capacity to receive a bequest given exclusively for another purpose which was charitable.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b603-13\">5. That the bequest for the erection of an Episcopal chapel and the support of a mission in connection therewith, would not be adjudged void, or impossible of execution, merely for reasons which challenged the expediency of the charity because no such mission then existed, because the place selected was unfitted geographically, because few persons would be likely to attend, and those few would be better served and accommodated elsewhere, or because the establishment of the proposed charity would be \u201ca wasteful expenditure of trust funds.\u201d Such conclusions, or reasons of appeal, unless based upon other facts alleged which justify them, do not present any traversable issue.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b603-15\">6. That it was immaterial that the ministry of the gospel which the bequest was designed to maintain was that of a particular denomination of Christians, to be supported in a particular church edifice.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b603-17\">7. That the terms of the bequest for a home for ladies of advanced age, or infirm, sufficiently implied that those only could share in the benefits of the gift who had no home, or no comfortable one ; that furnishing such shelter to such women was one mode of relieving the poor, and thus the bequest fell directly within our statute of charitable uses ( \u00a7 2951); and the fact that the relief was to be confined to members of one or two churches of a particular religious denomination did not deprive it of its charitable character.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b603-19\">8. That it was not necessary under the laws of this State, to uphold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>a perpetual trust for the relief of the poor, that it should he, in the strict sense, a \u201cpublic\u201d one: it is sufficient if it is not given for private, selfish uses, having no respect to the good of others.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b604-6\">9. That St. Paul\u2019s Society had implied power to decide as to the best means of applying the funds for a home for aged women.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b604-7\">In equity the inability or failure of a trustee to accept never involves a failure of the trust.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b604-8\">A demurrer admits the truth of such statements as can be deemed allegations of fact. It does not admit the truth of such as merely express the opinion of the pleader. An opinion may be so pleaded as to present a material issue, but it is then a conclusion as to a material point that reasonably follows from certain premises which are either established or 'may be a proper subject for proof.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b604-9\">In an equitable action by heirs at law to establish a resulting trust arising out of an attempted testamentary disposition, evidence may be adduced to show that such disposition directs what it is impossible to accomplish, provided this impossibility has been sufficiently averred.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b604-10\">Courts of probate in ordering the distribution of testate estates may consider events, whether prior or subsequent to the testator\u2019s death, so far as may be necessary to enable them to apply correctly the description of the parties to be benefited, and to effectuate the true intent of the whole instrument. They do not, however, have jurisdiction to make any final adjudication upon the validity or invalidity of testamentary trusts by reason of alleged difficulties in carrying them into execution, nor because they may deem them unwise in principle.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b604-11\">The Superior Court, on an appeal from such an order, has a wider jurisdiction, but it is one to be exercised with reserve and caution.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"A8c\">Even if the controlling purpose of a charitable bequest were to perpetuate the name and memory of the donor\u2019s family, that would not tend to invalidate the bequest.

If the income of said trust estate should not all he used as aforesaid then the surplus shall be added to the principal and shall become part thereof. It is my will to give my trustee full power to furnish such support for my brother Josephus as he may deem best: either by employing some suitable person to occupy the house belonging to said estate, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>and care for my said brother; or by providing for him otherwise as said trustee .may deem best.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b606-6\">\u201cTenth.

All the rest and residue of my property and estate of whatever kind and wherever situated, held by my trustee at the death of my brother Josephus, I will be divided into three equal parts, and I give and bequeath the same as follows. One-third part to \u2018 The Ladies\u2019 Seamen\u2019s Friend Society \u2019 of New Haven, a corporation organized under the laws of Connecticut, for the aiding of destitute seamen. The remaining two-thirds, parts, I give and bequeath to the episcopal church society of New Haven, Connecticut, known as \u2018 St. Pauls \u2019 to be used as provided in the following (15th) fifteenth section of this my will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AqF\">\u201c Fifteenth.

Whenever the said mission can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the wardens and vestry of the said \u2018 St. Pauls Society \u2019 that it is capable of maintaining itself as an independent church, then, when properly organized under the general laws of the \u00e9piscopal church and the laws of the State of Connecticut, the said wardens and vestry of \u2018 St. Pauls Society \u2019 shall convey to said church society so - organized all of the property received from my estate, for the use and benefit of said mission, to said church society to be its property forever.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b607-6\">\u201c The remaining half I direct the wardens and vestry of the said St. Paul\u2019s Society to invest in such a manner as will best provide a home for ladies of advanced age, or infirm, who are or who may hereafter become connected with the said St. Paul\u2019s church society, or with the mission or the church that is to be established upon my homestead, as hereinbefore provided for.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b607-7\">The testatrix died in 1888, aged 80, leaving a net estate of more that $400,000.

The right of the society to take a bequest, which, in addition to the amount of property held by it, would exceed 115,000, can only be questioned by the State in a proceeding brought for that purpose. <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Habersham, </em>107 U. S. 174; <em>Hanson </em>v. <em>Little Sisters of the Poor, </em>79 Md. 434 ; <em>Congregational Church </em>v. <em>Everett, </em>85 id. 79 ; <em>South &amp; N. A. R.

The limitation relates only to the exemption of property from taxation. The language of the charter speaks for itself. The Special Act of May 9, 1895, expressly validates all bequests theretofore made to the society, and is in itself a complete answer to the claim that the bequest is void for illegality or incapacity of the society to take. <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Clarke Institution, </em>110 Mass. 88. The gift is in aid of destitute seamen, and is for a charitable use. It is to be lawfully administered by said society in trust, or by such other trustee as may be appointed therefor, according to law. A devise for a charitable use is never allowed to fail for want, incapacity, or declination of a trustee. <em>American Bible Society </em>v. <em>Wetmore, </em>17 Conn. 188; <em>Storrs Agricultural School </em>v. <em>Whitney, </em>54 id. 345 ; <em>Bailey </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>60 id. 322; <em>White </em>v. <em>Howard, </em>38 id. 366; <em>Sohier </em>v. <em>Burr, </em>127 Mass. 221; 5 Amer. &amp; Eng.

If the society was incapable of acting as trustee at the death of the testatrix, as claimed by appellants, that incapacity has been removed by the Act of 1895, and administration, of the trust was properly confided to this Society by the probate court. <em>Fellows </em>v. <em>Miner, </em>119 Mass. 541.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b609-6\">The gift to St. Paul\u2019s Society for an old ladies\u2019 home is valid. That none of the ladies connected with the parish is either sick, poor or an object of charity, is immaterial, since such persons may at any time become members of the parish. The fact that the gift is limited to the members of the parish, or that' the society is not engaged in the work of providing a home for old ladies, is immaterial. <em>Conklin </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>63 Conn. 377; <em>Keith </em>v. <em>Scales, </em>124 N.

The purpose of erecting a chapel and supporting a mission is a charitable object which can be carried out adequately by the St. Paul\u2019s Society, even though no new independent church should ever be organized. The intention of a donor of a valid charitable trust must be carried out if possible, although the funds could be more efficiently administered in another place or applied to a different object. <em>Grand Prairie Seminary </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>171 Ill. 444.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b611-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number><em>Henry Stoddard </em>and <em>A.

The society was incorporated for accomplishing that and other purposes. It was therefore a suitable agency for the administration of the charity. It was to receive no beneficial interest.- Whatever should come into its hands, would come clothed with a special trust. <em>Dexter </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>63 Conn. 58, 60, 38 Amer. St. Rep. 336. If, then, it were legally incompetent to receive so large a legacy, the case would be simply one of the failure of a trustee. This in equity ne.ver involves a failure of the trust. When the difficulty arises from a refusal by the trustee appointed to act, it is necessary to have another one formally appointed by a court of equity or a court of probate. <em>Dailey </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>60 Conn. 314, 322. But here the trustee selected by the testatrix is ready to accept the office. It is and has always been unquestionably competent to receive so much of the legacy as does not make its entire property exceed $15,000 in value. It is not alleged that its property has ever attained that amount. The will creates two successive residuary estates. Everything not disposed of under the first eight articles became vested in Samuel E. Merwin as trustee, at the decease of the testatrix. The main object of this trust was to provide for the comfortable support of her brother as long as he should live, and for that purpose any part of the principal might be applied, should it be deemed necessary. Upon his death a second residue was to be formed. The bequest of $600 to St. Paul\u2019s Society was to be paid first. Her nephew and niece were to receive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>$200 each. The homestead was to pass to St. Paul\u2019s Society. A fund was to be reserved for a small annuity. All these provisions first became operative in enjoyment at the death of Josephus Forbes. This is expressly stated in the tenth and thirteenth articles; necessarily implied in the devise of the homestead, for it had been specifically devised to the trustee with a view to its use as a home for Josephus ; and fairly implied in the eleventh article, from the order in which it occurs in the will. Itwas this second residue, to be formed at the death of Josephus, which was the subject of the order appealed from. So long as Josephus lived it was uncertain what, if anything, would remain unexpended. It was also uncertain whether the incompetency of the Ladies\u2019 Seamen\u2019s Friend Society to take, if incompetent it were, would continue until his death. The interest of the heirs at law, therefore, during this period, if anything, was a contingent one, for it depended on uncertain and dubious events ; and an equitable one, for the legal estate was vested in another.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">While this state of things continued, the State intervened and made the Ladies\u2019 Seamen\u2019s Friend Society fully competent to accept such a trust. It could therefore have been appointed by a proper court, if there were no one to take and administer this residuary bequest, to receive it as trustee. <em>White </em>v. Howard, 88 Conn. 342, 366, 367.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">But there was no occasion for such an appointment. The bequest did not constitute a trust in name, but only by construction of law. The society had become entitled to take as legatee, precisely as one to whom a legacy- was left in his infancy, which has never been paid to his guardian, can claim it after arriving at full age. <em>Fellows </em>v. <em>Miner, </em>119 Mass. 541; <em>American Bible Society </em>v. <em>Wetmore, </em>17 Conn. 181, 187.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">It is contended by the heirs at law that one of the purposes of the society, that of endeavoring to benefit the temporal interests of such seamen as chance or commerce may bring to the port of New Haven, is not a charitable one. If this be so, it is immaterial to the inquiry as to its capacity to receive a bequest given exclusively for another purpose which is charitable.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>The reasons of appeal attack the validity of the bequest to St. Paul\u2019s Society for the purpose of erecting an episcopal chapel and sustaining a \u201c mission \u201d upon the homestead of the testatrix, on the following grounds; \u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">1. No such mission is now in existence and none may ever come into existence.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">2. \u201c It is and will be practically impossible to support or maintain a mission or church at the place and as provided in the first part of the fifteenth clause of the will. The designated place is unfitted geographically. There are and will be few, if any, persons that will attend or be ministered to by such mission or church, and the few that might attend or be ministered to by such mission or church would be better served and accommodated by other and surrounding protestant episcopal missions or churches.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-8\">\u201cThe testatrix\u2019s maiden name was Forbes, and her fortune disposed of by this will comes from the Forbes family living in the homestead referred to in this clause of the will; and the substantial purpose of this provision of the said will was to create and maintain in perpetuity a monument to the Forbes name in this particular place.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-9\">\u2022 \u201c There never has been nor is there likely to be any call, demand, or occasion for a parish at the homestead of the testatrix referred to in said will, nor is the vicinity of said homestead a field for mission work, nor is there or will there, in all probability, be any one to attend said chapel, if erected; and said expenditure of money, as directed in the fifteenth clause of said will, would be a wasteful expenditure of trust funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-10\">\u201c Said bequest to erect a chapel and maintain a mission in connection therewith is limited to a particular object and a particular institution. There is no general charitable intent, and it is not for general religious purposes, nor is there anything to indicate that the object of the testatrix was to benefit Saint Paul\u2019s Parish, or the parish to be created for the inhabitants of that portion of the city as a whole, and it is impossible to carry out the true intent of the testatrix.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b616-11\">To these allegations a demurrer has been interposed. This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>admits the truth of such of them as can be deemed allegations of fact. It does not admit the truth of such of them as merely express the opinion of the appellants. As to these, the only admission is that the appellants entertain them. <em>Wadsworth </em>v. Champion, 1 Root, 893, 395; <em>State </em>v. <em>Sykes, </em>28 Conn. 225, 228; <em>Woodruff v. New York &amp; N. E. R. Co., </em>59 id. 63, 89; <em>State\u2019s Attorney </em>v. <em>Selectmen, </em>ibid. 402, 410 ; <em>Bradley </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>61 id. 271, 279; <em>Connecticut Hospital for Insane </em>v. <em>Brookfield, </em>69 id. 1, 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">An opinion, however, may be such and so pleaded as to present a material issue. This is when it is a conclusion as to a material point that reasonably follows from certain premises, which either are established or may be a proper subject for proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">In an equitable action by heirs at law to establish a resulting trust arising out of an attempted testamentary disposition, evidence may be adduced to show that such disposition directs what it is impossible to accomplish, provided this impossibility has been sufficiently averred.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-8\">Courts of probate, in ordering the distribution of a testate estate, may consider events, whether prior or subsequent to the death of the testator, so far as may be necessary to enable them to apply correctly the description in the will of the parties to be benefited, and effectuate the true intent of the whole instrument. For this purpose and to this extent they have full chancery powers. <em>American, Bible Society </em>v. <em>Wetmore, </em>17 Conn. 181, 187. They do not, however, have jurisdiction to make any final adjudication upon the validity or invalidity of testamentary trusts by reason of alleged difficulties in carrying them into execution, nor because they may deem them unwise in principle. <em>Chamberlin\u2019s Appeal, </em>70 Conn. 363, 378.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-9\">The Superior Court on an appeal from probate has a wider jurisdiction, though it is one to be exercised with reserve and caution. <em>Mack\u2019s Appeal, </em>71 Conn. 122, 133.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-10\">No objection having been taken by the appellees to the form of the proceeding by which the appellants have sought to present their objections to the validity of the devise and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>bequest now in question, we think the reasons of appeal should be given the same effect as if they had been incorporated in the complaint in an equitable action to establish a resulting trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">Thus treated, the allegations of existing facts are that there is no mission now in existence; that the name of the testatrix was Forbes ; and that the funds in dispute came from the Forbes family inhabiting her homestead. The material allegations or conclusions of fact are, that it is and will be impossible to maintain a mission church upon the homestead, the grounds stated being that, as a site, it is unfitted geographically, and that there are few, if any, to whom such institutions could usefully minister; that to establish them would be a wasteful expenditure of trust funds; and that it is impossible to carry out the true intent of the testatrix.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">That there is no such mission now in existence is obviously no reason why there never should be any. It was to supply the want of one that the bequest was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-8\">That it was a piftpose of the testatrix that the chapel for which she provided should perpetuate the name and memory of her family at the place where they had their home is apparent from the will. If it were her controlling purpose, this would not tend to invalidate the bequest. The motive for doing a lawful act, whatever it may be, cannot make it an unlawful act. <em>McCune </em>v. <em>Norwich City Gas Co., </em>30 Conn. 521, 524; <em>Mack's Appeal, </em>71 id. 122, 127, note, 135.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-9\">The conclusions of fact must be weighed and judged by the facts alleged to support them. <em>McCune </em>v. <em>Norwich City Gas Co., </em>30 Conn. 521.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-10\">Could then, had these reasons of appeal been traversed, evidence have been properly received to show that the site prescribed for the proposed chapel and mission is unfitted for the purpose ?</p>\n<p id=\"b618-11\">It would, of course, be of no avail to prove that a better one might have been selected. To overthrow the will in this regard proof would be necessary that the homestead was incapable of serving as a site for an episcopal chapel or mission. The history of the world and of all religions teaches <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>that churches, convents and temples have been maintained and frequented for ages in places remote from any center of population, and, on the other hand, that no city is so crowded with houses of worship that in the opinion of the adherents of some sect or denomination there is not a call for more.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">It appears from the will before us that the homestead of the testatrix is in New Haven. If it be in the middle of it, she had a right to dedicate it to religious uses. If it be in the remotest outskirts, she had the same right. No uses can be more distinctively religious than the establishment of a mission church. It cannot be, in the nature of things, impossible that one may be successfully organized by St. Paul\u2019s Society to occupy a chapel built on the designated lot. The testatrix had a right to provide that the experiment should be tried. <em>Grand Prairie Seminary </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>171 Ill. 444, 49 Northeastern Rep. 516. Should it fail after a fair trial, an opportunity would then first arise for her heirs at law to bring before a proper court of equity proceedings to determine whether there was a resulting trust in their favor, o\u00edan occasion for the application of the doctrine of approximation. <em>Hayden </em>v. <em>Connecticut Hospital, </em>64 Conn. 320, 325.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">The averments \u201c that there are few, if any, persons who will attend or be ministered to by such mission or church;\u201d that these few would be \u201c better served and accommodated by other and surrounding protestant episcopal missions or churches;\u201d and that there is not and will not \u201cin all probability be anyone to attend said chapel,\u201d taken together, import that there will be not none, but only a few to whom such a mission and church would minister, and that these could be better ministered to by similar institutions already existing in the surrounding territory. This is an admission that there are and will be some to take benefit from the charity, and therefore, that it is not impossible to maintain it. The testatrix has provided ample funds for the purpose of supporting religious worship at the place in question, and that the worshippers will be few does not prove that no good will be accomplished.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-8\">It was her \u201c true intent \u201d that the Forbes chapel should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>be erected and a mission set up in connection with it. It does not appear that she looked forward to the gathering of a large congregation there. It does appear that she thought those who would worship there would, at first, be too few or too poor to meet the necessary expenses of maintaining such an establishment. In giving it the name of a mission church, she necessarily implied that it was to be a center of missionary effort to bring under Christian influences those who before were indifferent or hostile to them. The reasons of appeal, taken in connection with the will, show that it is not impossible to carry out this general intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">The trust is for an object plainly charitable. General Statutes, \u00a7 2951. That the ministry of the gospel which it was designed to maintain was that of a particular denomination of Christians, and to be supported in a particular church edifice, is immaterial. <em>Conklin </em>v. Davis, 63 Conn. 377, 384; <em>Mack's </em>Appeal, 71 id. 122, 135. Every episcopal society is expressly empowered to receive any property to use \u201cfor maintaining religious worship according to the doctrine, discipline, and worship of said church, and for the support of the educational and charitable institutions of the same.\u201d General Statutes, \u00a7 2075. The property is given for immediate use, and not tied up for an indefinite period with an intervening estate created for the benefit of private individuals, as in <em>Jocelyn </em>v. <em>Nott, </em>44 Conn. 55. The ease is not one of those in which the trustee, being one whose personal agency is indispensable for carrying out the intended purpose, declines the trust, and when summoned into a court of equity declares its execution to be impracticable, as in <em>Teele </em>v. <em>Bishop of </em>Derry, 168 Mass. 341, 47 Northeastern Rep. 422. Nothing is stated in the reasons of appeal as having occurred since the death of the testatrix to change the situation as it existed when the will was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">Under these circumstances, no material and traversable issue was presented by the averment that to establish the chapel and mission as directed by the will would be \u201c a wasteful expenditure of trust funds.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b620-8\">The reasons of appeal attack the validity of the bequest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>to \u201c provide a home for ladies of advanced age, or infirm, who are or may hereafter become connected with the said Saint Paul\u2019s Church Society, or with the mission or the church that is to be established upon my homestead.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">The grounds set up are these: It \u201c is not charitable, but benevolent only. It is not <em>public; </em>it is indefinite. It is uncertain and unlawful in that it commits to the wardens and vestry an arbitrary power and discretion to appropriate the avails of said investment to purposes neither public nor charitable.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">\u201c There is no such home as is mentioned in said will of Betsey Bradley connected with or maintained or supported by said society or parish, nor is said society or parish engaged in the work of providing a home for ladies of advanced age, or infirm, or any other like home.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-8\">\u201cThe said Betsey Bradley has been for many years a member of said society or parish known as St. Paul\u2019s, and so associated with a number of other ladies in like manner connected with said society or parish, none of whom were either sick, or poor, or objects of charity, or within the class or classes or description of persons to whom or for whose use and benefit the said attempted gift and bequest could lawfully be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-9\">\u201c No person could or can be or become connected with said society or parish except by the voluntary permission or action of said society or parish, or its officers and agents, and connection with said society or parish is dependent or contingent upon the fulfillment by the person or individual of certain theological tests and requirements, and the acceptance of certain theological dogmas, which said tests, requirements, and dogmas are peculiar, and confined to that particular ecclesiastical organization.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b621-10\">That the testatrix as a member of St. Paul\u2019s parish had been long associated with other ladies, also members of it, who stood in no need of a home, is obviously unimportant. It was not for such of her associates that she sought to provide. The terms of the bequest are entitled to a liberal construction in furtherance of the intent of the testatrix. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number><em>Woodruff v. </em>Marsh, 63 Conn. 125, 136. Thus construed, they sufficiently imply that those only can be entitled to share in the benefits of this gift who have no home or no comfortable one. To give proper shelter to women in that condition who are either of advanced age or infirm, is a mode of relieving the poor, and so falls directly within our statute of charitable uses. General Statutes, \u00a7 2951. St. Paul\u2019s Society takes, itself, no beneficial interest. It is a trustee for a designated purpose, to give a home to the homeless. <em>White </em>v. <em>Howard, </em>38 Conn. 342, 366.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">That this relief is to be confined to members of one or two particular churches of a particular religious denomination, does not deprive it of its charitable character. It is not necessary, under the laws of Connecticut, to uphold a perpetual trust for the relief of the poor, that it should be in the strict sense a public one. The term \u201c public,\u201d as used in that strict or technical sense, may be properly confined to gifts by which there'is \u201csome benefit to be conferred upon, or duty to be performed towards, either the public at large or some part thereof, or an indefinite class of persons; \u201d thus excluding those pointing out a particular \u201c body, or a definite number of persons, ascertained or ascertainable,\u201d to receive control and enjoy their benefit, even when they are for what are of the nature of religious uses. <em>Old South Society </em>v. <em>Crocker, </em>119 Mass. 1, 22, 23. In another and more natural sense, \u201c public \u201d is used, in respect to a testamentary gift, to distinguish it from a \u201c private charity,\u201d so as to exclude gifts to selfish uses, and benefits conferred on particular individuals designated by name, or to be designated thereafter from a class separated from the rest of the world by some private or personal relations, having no respect to the good of others. Gifts of this latter description are not protected against the effect of the rule against perpetuities ; but that now in controversy is not one of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-8\">Whether the protection accorded by General Statutes, \u00a7 2951, to estates granted \u201c for any other public and charitable use,\u201d is not equivalent to \u201c for any other public or charitable use,\u201d is a question suggested and left undecided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>in <em>Hamden </em>v. <em>Rice, </em>24 Conn. 350, 354, 355. But, be that as it may, the benefit now in controversy is for one of the uses previously specified in the statute, and the legislature has not limited those uses by requiring them to be public in the technical sense as well as charitable. <em>Groodrich\u2019s Appeal, </em>57 Conn. 275, 284; <em>Conklin </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>63 id. 377, 383, 384; <em>Christ Church </em>v. <em>Trustees, </em>67 id. 554, 565; <em>Mack\u2019s Appeal, </em>71 id. 122, 135.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">This bequest to St. Paul\u2019s Society is to be invested by its wardens and vestry \u201c in such a manner as will best provide a home \u201d for those of the class specified who may need such relief. The power to decide as to the best means of applying the funds for this purpose is impliedly given to the society. It inheres in the trust. <em>Woodruff </em>v. <em>Marsh, </em>63 Conn. 125, 128; <em>Mach\u2019s Appeal, </em>71 id. 122, 135.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">That there is now no parish home of such a kind is immaterial. The society has ample power to undertake the establishment of such a charitable institution. General Statutes, \u00a7 2075. Nor does the will make it indispensable that those for whose relief a home is to be offered should be gathered under a common roof. The society is left free, should it deem best, to provide a home for each or any of them in a private family.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">The Superior Court is advised to sustain the demurrer to the reasons of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-9\">No costs will be taxed in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-10\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
