Olmsted, in March, 1898, by which Olmsted took the agency for the sale of the plaintiff\u2019s goods at Hartford in this State. This contract contained no time limit, but it was therein expressly provided that it might be terminated \u201c at any time on written notice by either party to the other.\u201d Before the plaintiff would enter into this contract, it required Olmsted to send to it a written contract of guaranty; and thereupon Olmsted requested the defendant to execute and deliver to the plaintiff the contract sued upon, dated March 9th, 1898, and this being done, the plaintiff executed the contract with Olmsted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b505-12\">The material parts of the contract sued upon are as follows: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number><em>\u201c </em>To Indiana Bicycle Company, Indianapolis, Ind.:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b506-6\">\u201c Dear Sirs : In consideration that you will sell and deliver on credit to George N. Olmsted of Hartford, County of Hartford, State of Connecticut, bicycles, bicycle parts, sundries, and other articles connected with or pertaining to bicycles, I hereby guarantee the payment to you of the price of and value of said bicycles, sundries, and other articles at the time or times of payment agreed upon by said George N. Olmsted to an amount not exceeding $500. This shall be held as a continuing guarantee by him in your favor for all such bicycles, sundries, and other articles that you have sold or that you may from time to time sell and deliver to said George N. Olmsted, until further notice from me. . . . And whenever George hi. Olmsted owes you any sum whatever for any of the bicycles, sundries, or other articles above mentioned, and the same becomes due and payable, I am to pay the same on demand if the said George N. Olmsted does not pay the same when due. My liability to be limited to the said sum of five hundred dollars.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b506-7\">The negotiations between the plaintiff and the defendant Olmsted which resulted in said contracts, were conducted on behalf of the plaintiff by one Hoblett, its agent to establish agencies for the sale of its goods; but in performing this duty Hoblett had no authority to make contracts on behalf of the plaintiff, nor to bind it thereby. Pursuant to its agreement with Olmsted, the plaintiff, during the year 1898, sold and delivered its goods to him on credit, at Hartford, from time to time as required. In December, 1898, the plaintiff and Olmsted entered- into another contract, which in terms rescinded the prior one, and was in its provisions similar to that. This second contract was negotiated by Hoblett, as agent for the plaintiff, substantially in the same way as the first had been. When this second contract was made Olmsted was not indebted to the plaintiff, except for a small balance evidenced by a note which was paid at maturity. In February, 1899, Hoblett had a conversation with the defendant in which Hoblett said, in substance, that Olmsted was a good man, had sold a large number of wheels for the plaintiff in 1898, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>and had settled in full with the plaintiff and did not owe it a cent. The defendant then said to Hoblett, \u201c Cancel the bond then.\u201d Hoblett replied, \u201c I will,\u201d \u201cAll right,\u201d or some similar expression of assent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b507-6\">In March, 1899, Hoblett requested the defendant and his partner to sign a new guaranty for Olmsted, stating that Olmsted had settled in full for the previous year, \u201c and that the guaranty had been canceled.\u201d They refused to sign the proposed guaranty. The plaintiff continued to deal with Olmsted under the second contract during the year 1899, and during that year Olmsted defaulted in his payments to the plaintiff in the sum of $232.48. During each of the years 1898 and 1899 the total liability incurred by Olmsted to the plaintiff, and the payments made by him upon such liability, exceeded $500. Defendant gave no notice to the plaintiff of the termination of the contract of guaranty, unless the above mentioned direction to Hoblett to \u201c cancel the bond \u201d constitutes such notice. \u201c Hoblett had no authority to receive such notice for the plaintiff.\u201d Upon the trial the defendant, on his direct examination, was asked to state the circumstances under which he signed the guaranty contract, and answered as follows: \u201c Sometime, I think in February, 1898, Mr. Olmsted asked me if I would go his surety for the year 1898 on a bicycle bond.\u201d This answer was excluded, on the ground that it tended to vary the terms of the written contract. The defendant afterwards testified, without objection, that Hoblett told him the guaranty was for 1898, and that he supposed it rvas a bond for a year. Oh the trial below the defendant claimed as matter of law (1) that the guaranty was not a continuing one ; (2) that, when in 1898 Olmsted had incurred and paid to plaintiff an indebtedness of $500, the guaranty was exhausted; (3) that the notice given by the defendant to Hoblett to cancel the guaranty was sufficient. The court overruled these claims.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b507-7\"><em>Percy 8. Bryant </em>and <em>Hugh M.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ayb\">The principal questions in this case are whether the guaranty sued upon was one which continued \u201c until further notice\u201d from the defendant to the plaintiff, and whether the defendant gave that notice before the indebtedness sued for was incurred. The first question must be answered in the affirmative. The contract provides in express terms that it shall be a continuing guaranty in favor of the plaintiff, to the amount of $500, until further notice from the defendant to the plaintiff; and there is nothing in the contract, or in the facts found, to detract from the force of this express provision. The guaranty is not limited to the time covered by any contract of agency between the plaintiff and Olmsted, nor does it allude or refer to any such contract. It covers all sales contemplated in it, made by the plaintiff to Olmsted after its delivery and before notice, however and whenever made. In short, the guaranty continued during the pleasure of the defendant, and it covered all sales made by the plaintiff to .Olmsted during that period of <em>time; </em>but the defendant\u2019s liability under it could never exceed $500. In this sense the guaranty was a continuing one and the trial court, upon the facts found, did not err in so holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">The defendant claimed in the trial court, and now claims, that the notice he gave to Hoblett in February, 1899, to \u201c cancel the bond,\u201d was notice to the plaintiff that the guaranty contract was at an <em>end; </em>and the next question is, assuming this was such notice to Hoblett, whether it was also such notice to the plaintiff. It was if Hoblett was the agent of the plaintiff for that purpose, otherwise not. Whether Hoblett was the agent of the plaintiff for such purpose was a question to be determined by the trial court from the evidence, and it has found that he was not. There is nothing upon the record, including the evidence certified, to show that the court erred in coming to that conclusion, and it must stand as found. It follows that up to the time when Olmsted made default in his payments to the plaintiff in 1899, the defendant had given no notice to the plaintiff that the guaranty was at an end, and that the guaranty covered the indebtedness sought to be recovered in this suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>The evidence excluded, if offered, as it appears to have been, to prove a guaranty for the year 1898 alone, was rightly excluded, on the ground that such evidence could not prevail over the words of the written instrument.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">There is no error..</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
