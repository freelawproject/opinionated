The defendant had no other creditors at the time, nor, so far as appeared, at the time of trial; and the plaintiff, while aware that the excess was fictitious, did not know what the defendant\u2019s precise purpose was in the transaction.

The issues were found in favor of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>plaintiff, and judgment was rendered that he recover $239.90; this sum representing a debt of $175 with interest at 5 per cent to date of judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b215-6\">The court found the following material facts: On October 26th, 1893, the defendant was indebted to his brother, the plaintiff, for money loaned, in the sum of $175. On the same day the defendant executed the note in question, for $600, and the mortgage on his real estate to secure the same, in favor of the plaintiff. The defendant caused the mortgage to be recorded, and delivered the note and mortgage to the plaintiff. Shortly before this time the defendant had contracted to build a house for one Jacobs ; and if Jacobs should fail to pay him, then the land mortgaged, which constituted all his property, might be needed to satisfy liabilities he might incur in constructing the building. At the time of the mortgage he had in fact no creditors, and, so far as appears, has since satisfied all his obligations. The defendant knew he was indebted to his brother, and fearing that his land might be imperiled, executed the note and mortgage to secure his brother for the debt due him. His purpose in making the note for an amount so largely in excess of the debt actually due his brother, was to cover up his property from any future possible attachment, to the extent of the excess. The plaintiff knew that the note and mortgage included the sum of $425 in excess of the amount actually due him, but it did not appear that he was acquainted with the defendant\u2019s precise purpose in so executing them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b215-7\">The defendant made the following claims of law in respect to the judgment rendered: (1) That the note in suit was without lawful consideration, and that the plaintiff .could not recover on the same. (2) That the note having been given by the defendant, with the mortgage deed to secure it, for the purpose of creating a fictitious debt to the plaintiff and to place the defendant\u2019s property in the hands of the plaintiff to prevent the defendant\u2019s creditors from collecting their debts of him, was illegal and fraudulent in law, and that no recovery whatever could be had by the plaintiff in this suit brought on the note. The court did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>not rule as claimed by the defendant, but made the following rulings: (1) That so far as the note was evidence of actual indebtedness, it should be sustained; but that there was no consideration, and that no recovery could be had, for the fictitious excess. (2) That judgment should be rendered for the amount of the actual indebtedness, $175, with interest thereon at five per cent, from said October 26th, 1898.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b216-6\">The appeal assigns error in rendering any judgment for the plaintiff upon the facts found, and in certain rulings upon the admission of evidence.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b216-7\"><em>William H. Shields </em>and <em>Edward T. Burke, </em>for the appellant (defendant).</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b216-8\"><em>Charles F. </em>Thayer, for the appellee (plaintiff).</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b216-9\">Hamersley, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A1N\">The substance of the defendant\u2019s claim is that the court erred in holding, upon the facts found, that the plaintiff was entitled to sue upon the note. If any reasonable inference from these facts will support the action, the judgment should be sustained. We think the facts fairly justify treating the note secured by the mortgage as a collateral security for an existing indebtedness of $175. Such a security gave the plaintiff not only the right to appropriate the land pledged for the satisfaction of the principal indebtedness, but also the right to whatever advantage there might be in the ability to sue the defendant upon the note given as security, as well as upon the principal debt. <em>In re Waddell-Entz Co., </em>67 Conn. 324, 334.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-10\">If the purpose of the defendant in putting the lien upon his land was fraudulent, as he now claims, so as to invalidate-the mortgage deed, that fraud, in which the plaintiff did not' participate, does not deprive him of his right to sue upon the note; and upon such suit he is entitled to recover at least the amount due upon his principal indebtedness. The defendant cannot complain if the amount recovered was too small.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-11\">Upon the trial the plaintiff offered in evidence the note <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>upon which suit was brought, and the defendant objected, on the ground of variance between it and the note described in the complaint: the note offered in evidence containing a promise to pay taxes, while the complaint contained no reference to taxes. The court overruled the objection and the defendant duly excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">The plaintiff did not seek to recover damages for a failure to pay taxes ; the note offered in evidence supported the allegations of the complaint, and the variance between it and the description in the complaint was immaterial. The objection was properly overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">The plaintiff testified upon his examination-in-chief that the note was due and held by him. The defendant\u2019s counsel upon cross-examination sought to prove by the plaintiff the fact of payment and other matters of defense. The court excluded questions asked for this purpose, on the ground that they related to the defendant\u2019s case. The defendant duly excepted to these rulings. Subsequently the plaintiff was called as a witness by the defendant, and was fully inquii-ed of as to the matters referred to.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-8\">The order of testimony, and the cross-examination of a plaintiff\u2019s witness for the purpose of establishing the defendant\u2019s case, are largely within the discretion of a trial court. The defendant was not injured by the exercise of that discretion as stated in the finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-9\">There is no error in the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-10\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
