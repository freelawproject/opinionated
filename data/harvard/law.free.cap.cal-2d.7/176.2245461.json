It has subsequently appeared, and it is conceded by respondent, that after a prior trial, defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial was granted, and notice of appeal from the order granting such new trial was given by respondent.  Hence, an appeal was pending at the time the present trial took place, and the court below was without jurisdiction to try the defendant. The judgment must therefore be reversed on this ground, and it is unnecessary to determine the other issues raised by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
