Aside <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>from a statement that it was error to sustain a general demurrer to his complaint without leave to amend, the appellant\u2019s brief contains only a lengthy quotation from <em>Carpentier </em>v. <em>Montgomery, </em>13 Wall. (80 U. S.) 480 [20 L. Ed. 698], to the effect that confirmation of a Spanish or Mexican grant by the government does not cut off equitable rights but merely establishes legal title in the confirmee.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">The allegations of the complaint are not summarized and there is no statement of the facts upon which the appellant bases his claim to an equitable title, if that is his claim. This brief shows a flagrant disregard of section 953c of the Code of Civil Procedure and of section 3 of rule VIII of the rules of this court. There is no affirmative showing of error and the judgment, should be affirmed. <em>(Dahlberg </em>v. <em>Dahlberg, </em>202 Cal. 295 [260 Pac. 290]; <em>Haines </em>v. <em>Commercial Mortgage Co., </em>205 Cal. 71 [269 Pac. 921].)</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">The ruling on this motion was made on October 5, 1936, at which time the motion was granted and the judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
