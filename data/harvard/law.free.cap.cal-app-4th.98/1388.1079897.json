(Gafcon) sued its liability insurer Travelers Property Casualty Corporation (Travelers), Travelers\u2019 in-house law firm Ponsor &amp; Associates, and Ponsor lawyer Roger von Kaesborg (collectively Ponsor) seeking, among other relief, a judicial declaration that (1) Travelers\u2019 use of employee attorneys to defend its insureds constitutes the unauthorized practice of law; (2) insurance companies in general improperly exercise control over their employee attorneys so as to interfere with their independence and professional judgment in representing insureds; (3) Travelers in the present case operated under a conflict requiring it to pay for independent Cumis<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> counsel; and (4) insurance companies derive an illegal profit from use of in-house counsel in representing insureds. Travelers and Ponsor moved for summary judgment; the court granted the motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-7\">On appeal, Gafcon asks us to broadly decide as a matter of law that insurance companies engage in the unauthorized practice of law when they use employee attorneys to defend their insureds. Gafcon additionally challenges the court\u2019s summary judgment ruling on grounds that (1) disputed issues of fact exist as to whether Ponsor illegally split fees with Travelers and operated under a conflict of interest in representing Gafcon in the underlying negligent construction litigation; and (2) Travelers did not address Gafcon\u2019s unfair business practices cause of action in its motion. Gafcon finally contends the court erred in refusing to grant its requests for additional discovery in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-8\">With respect to Ponsor, we conclude it demonstrated the absence of a present and actual controversy appropriate for declaratory relief, and therefore the court correctly granted summary judgment in its favor. With respect to Travelers, we conclude under the undisputed facts of this case, Travelers\u2019 use of Ponsor to represent Gafcon did not amount to the practice of law. In reaching this conclusion, we necessarily hold an insurance company does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1397\">*1397</page-number>engage in the practice of law due to the mere employment relationship between the insurer and the attorneys defending its insured against third party claims. Our holding is in part based on the recognition that in these instances, and absent conflicts of interest giving rise to independent counsel, the attorney represents both insurer and insured. We also conclude Gafcon failed to raise disputed issues of fact preventing summary adjudication of its request for declaratory relief as to Ponsor\u2019s fee splitting and as to its cause of action for unfair competition. Because Travelers failed to meet its threshold summary judgment burden to establish the absence of a conflict of interest arising from Ponsor\u2019s defense of the underlying lawsuit, however, the court could not properly deny declaratory relief as to that cause of action. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment as to Ponsor, but reverse the judgment as to Travelers with directions set forth below.</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-4\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"A-E\">\n<em>The Underlying Collection/Negligent Construction Litigation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-5\">In 1995, the Palm Desert Resorter Homeowners Association (the Association) retained Gafcon, a construction management firm, to manage reconstruction work at the Palm Desert Resorter planned community. After a dispute arose over fees, Gafcon retained Stuart M. Eppsteiner and his then law firm Gibbs &amp; Eppsteiner and sued the Association for unpaid fees. The Association cross-complained against Gafcon alleging, among others, causes of action for negligent supervision and advice; breach of contract and express and implied warranties; strict liability; and nuisance.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1117-6\">Gafcon tendered the Association\u2019s action to its general liability insurer, Travelers, which accepted the defense but reserved its rights to allocate any payment of judgments or settlement between covered and noncovered claims and seek reimbursement for such payments and expenses. In particular Travelers pointed out its insurance did not apply to claims falling within an endorsement entitled \u201cExclusion\u2014Testing or Consulting Errors and Omissions.\u201d That provision excluded from coverage any claim for bodily injury, property damage, personal injury, or advertising injury arising out of \u201c[a]ny error, omission, defect or deficiency in any test performed, or evaluation, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1398\">*1398</page-number>consultation <em>[sic] </em>or advice given by or on behalf of any insured\u201d or \u201c[t]he reporting of or reliance upon any such test, evaluation, consultation or advice.\u201d Travelers assigned one of its staff counsel, Ponsor &amp; Associates, to represent Gafcon.</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-4\">In May 1999, Ponsor lawyer von Kaesborg met with Eppsteiner about the litigation. Among other things, Eppsteiner advised von Kaesborg that he felt Ponsor operated under a conflict of interest in representing both Travelers and Gafcon. In response to these assertions, von Kaesborg advised both Eppsteiner and Gafcon principal Yehudi Gaffen that while his law firm was a unit of Travelers Indemnity Company\u2019s staff counsel organization and its lawyers were Travelers employees, it was not retained to represent Travelers or its interests but was retained solely to represent Gafcon. Von Kaesborg advised Gaffen and Eppsteiner that Ponsor &amp; Associates would not put Travelers\u2019 interests above Gafcon\u2019s and was not involved in making coverage determinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-5\">Several months later, von Kaesborg learned Ponsor &amp; Associates had a potential conflict of interest representing Gafcon in the Association lawsuit.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A technical specialist with Travelers called Eppsteiner and left several messages offering to retain his firm at Travelers\u2019 standard hourly rate. When Eppsteiner failed to respond to those messages, von Kaesborg advised Gaffen of the potential conflict and notified it he had arranged for one of Travelers\u2019 outside panel counsel, Selski, Sturgeon and Wehbe, to represent Gafcon in the Association\u2019s case. Although Ponsor thereafter sought to withdraw from the matter with Gaffen\u2019s permission, Gaffen never responded to Ponsor\u2019s request that it execute a substitution form.</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-6\">\n<em>The Present Litigation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-7\">In October 1999, less than a month after Ponsor advised Gaffen it had a conflict of interest requiring its withdrawal, Gafcon served Travelers and Ponsor with the complaint in the present action. Approximately a month later, Ponsor obtained a court order relieving it as Gafcon\u2019s counsel of record.</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1399\">*1399</page-number>In spite of Travelers\u2019 retention of outside counsel to represent Gafcon\u2019s interests, Gafcon proceeded with its action. In April 2000, it filed its second amended complaint naming Travelers, Ponsor and several other insurers, alleging causes of action for breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, unfair business practices under Business and Professions Code section 17200, as well as declaratory relief. In addition to damages, injunctive relief and restitution, Gafcon sought three judicial declarations applicable to both Ponsor and Travelers: (1) the practice of insurance companies, and specifically Travelers, in hiring staff counsel to represent their insureds, constitutes the unauthorized practice of law, and that when staff counsel represent the insured they are aiding insurance companies in the unauthorized practice of law; (2) Gafcon had the right to independent counsel of its own choosing to defend the Association\u2019s cross-complaint; and (3) \u201cinsurance companies derive an illegal profit off the representation of the insured through staff counsel.\u201d As to Travelers and the other insurers, Gafcon sought a fourth declaration: that it \u201chad the right to independent counsel who charges for attorney fees at the rate at which the market would dictate, for counsel retained in the ordinary course of business in the defense of similar actions in the community where the claim arose or is being defended, were it not for insurance companies engaging in the unauthorized practice of law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-4\">Both Ponsor and Travelers moved for summary judgment and alternatively summary adjudication. Travelers argued the trial court could summarily dispose of Gafcon\u2019s causes of action under a 1987 ethics opinion of the California State Bar\u2019s Standing Committee on Professional Responsibility and Conduct (State Bar Formal Opn. 1987-91, 1987 WL 109707, hereinafter State Bar Opinion No. 1987-91). This opinion concluded the employment of attorneys by insurance companies did not constitute the unauthorized practice of law. In addition, Travelers relied upon evidence that Ponsor never advised Travelers on the scope of insurance coverage, split fees with Travelers, or engaged in any unlawful, misleading or unfair business practice or deceptive advertising. Ponsor advanced the same arguments, but further maintained it was entitled to summary judgment because Gafcon had not sought any \u201cdirect relief or damages\u201d against it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-5\">In its motion, Travelers sought an adjudication that Gafcon\u2019s declaratory relief causes of action had no merit in part because, as a matter of law, it did not \u201caid and abet in the unauthorized practice of law when it retained attorneys it employed to represent Gafcon in the [underlying] litigation.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It submitted the declarations of von Kaesborg and its senior technical specialist <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1400\">*1400</page-number>handling the case, Todd Lightbody. After setting forth the circumstances of his retention by Travelers, the fact of his employment with the company, and his later withdrawal from the underlying litigation, von Kaesborg averred generally that Ponsor \u201cwas not retained to represent Travelers\u201d and at no time did he or the law firm place Travelers\u2019 interests over Gafcon\u2019s. According to von Kaesborg, he exercised his own professional judgment on Gafcon\u2019s behalf at all times, and \u201cTravelers never interfered with that judgment\u201d nor did Travelers \u201cin any manner limit or restrict our ability to represent Gafcon in the underlying litigation.\u201d Finally von Kaesborg averred that while he was aware Travelers provided a defense under a reservation of rights, Ponsor &amp; Associates had no responsibility for the coverage determination made by Travelers; that Ponsor &amp; Associates \u201cwas not retained by Travelers, nor did [it] represent or advise Travelers, with respect to the scope of coverage for Gafcon, and [it] was not involved with any factual or legal investigation regarding the reservation of rights.\u201d Lightbody similarly averred that Ponsor &amp; Associates and its attorneys, including von Kaesborg, never had any responsibility regarding Travelers\u2019 coverage determination. He stated Ponsor &amp; Associates was never retained by Travelers regarding scope of coverage, and none of its lawyers were involved with any \u201cfactual or legal investigation regarding Travelers\u2019 reservation of rights.\u201d He averred, \u201cPonsor &amp; Associates was retained for the sole purpose of representing Gafcon\u2019s rights in the [underlying] litigation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-4\">Following the hearing on Ponsor\u2019s motion, the parties stipulated to continue the hearing on Travelers\u2019 motion in order to permit Gafcon time to conduct certain discovery and bring motions to compel discovery from Travelers before filing its opposition papers. Thereafter, in opposition to Travelers\u2019 motion, Gafcon submitted its counsel\u2019s declaration indicating Gafcon could not present certain evidence tending to establish facts relevant to the issues raised in its second amended complaint because the court had denied its various motions to compel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-5\">The court granted summary judgment in favor of Travelers and Ponsor. Citing <em>Cumis, supra, </em>162 Cal.App.3d 358, and <em>Blanchard </em>v. <em>State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co. </em>(1991) 2 Cal.App.4th 345 [2 Cal.Rptr.2d 884] (Blanchard), it ruled as a matter of law the employment of attorneys by insurance companies does not constitute the unauthorized practice of law. The court also ruled Gafcon failed to raise material issues of fact to show Travelers or Ponsor engaged in or aided the unauthorized practice of law or had a conflict <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1401\">*1401</page-number>of interest requiring the appointment of <em>Cumis. </em>counsel under Civil Code section 2860. It entered judgment in Travelers and Ponsor\u2019s favor. Gafcon appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-4\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"AE2\">I. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1121-5\">A defendant moving for summary judgment \u201cbears the burden of persuasion that \u2018one or more elements of\u2019 the \u2018cause of action\u2019 in question \u2018cannot be established,\u2019 or that \u2018there is a complete defense\u2019 thereto.\u201d <em>(Aguilar </em>v. <em>Atlantic Richfield Co. </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 850 [107 Cal.Rptr.2d 841, 24 P.3d 493] <em>(Aguilar), </em>citing Code Civ. Proc.,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u00a7 437c, subd. (o)(2).) A defendant may, but need not conclusively negate an element of the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action; rather, \u201c[a]ll that the defendant need do is to \u2018show[ ] that one or more elements of the cause of action . . . cannot be established\u2019 by the plaintiff.\u201d <em>(Aguilar, </em>at p. 853, citing \u00a7 437c, subd. (o)(2).) In meeting its burden, the defendant must present evidence, in the form of affidavits, declarations, admissions, answers to interrogatories, depositions or matters of which judicial notice must be taken. <em>(Aguilar, </em>at p. 855; \u00a7 437c, subd. (b).) In addition to presenting evidence that negates an element of plaintiff\u2019s cause of action, \u201c[t]he defendant may also present evidence that the plaintiff does not possess, and cannot reasonably obtain, needed evidence\u2014as through admissions by the plaintiff following extensive discovery to the effect that he has discovered nothing.\u201d <em>(Aguilar, </em>at p. 855, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-6\">Once a defendant has met its burden of showing that a cause of action has no merit, \u201c \u2018the burden shifts to the plaintiff ... to show that a triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to that cause of action or a defense thereto.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Aguilar, supra, </em>25 Cal.4th at p. 849.) The plaintiff may not rely upon the mere allegations or denials of its pleading to show a triable issue of material facts exists but instead shall set forth the specific facts showing that a triable issue of material fact exists. (\u00a7 437c, subds. (c), (o)(2); <em>Aguilar, supra, </em>at p. 849; <em>Parsons v. Crown Disposal Co. </em>(1997) 15 Cal.4th 456, 464 &amp; fn. 4 [63 Cal.Rptr.2d 291, 936 P.2d 70]; <em>Scheiding v. Dinwiddie Construction Co. </em>(1999) 69 Cal.App.4th 64, 69 [81 Cal.Rptr.2d 360].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-7\">Summary judgment procedure includes declaratory relief actions \u201c \u2018in a proper case.\u2019 \u201d <em>(National Exhibition Co. v. City and County of San Francisco </em>(1972) 24 Cal.App.3d 1, 11 [100 Cal.Rptr. 757], citing <em>Walker v. Munro </em>(1960) 178 Cal.App.2d 67, 70 [2 Cal.Rptr. 737].) \u201c \u2018 \u201c[T]he propriety <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1402\">*1402</page-number>of the application of [summary judgment to] declaratory relief lies in the trial court\u2019s function to render such a judgment when only legal issues are presented for its determination.\u201d \u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Las Tunas Beach Geologic Hazard Abatement Dist. v. Superior Court </em>(1995) 38 Cal.App.4th 1002, 1015-1016 [45 Cal.Rptr.2d 529].) When summary judgment is appropriate, the court should decree only that plaintiffs are not entitled to the declarations in their favor. <em>(Spencer v. Hibernia Bank </em>(1960) 186 Cal.App.2d 702, 712 [9 Cal.Rptr. 867], citing <em>Essick v. City of Los Angeles </em>(1950) 34 Cal.2d 614, 624-625 [213 P.2d 492].) Thus, in a declaratory relief action, the defendant\u2019s burden is to establish the plaintiff is not entitled to a declaration in its favor. It may do this by establishing (1) the sought-after declaration is legally incorrect; (2) undisputed facts do not support the premise for the sought-after declaration; or (3) the issue is otherwise not one that is appropriate for declaratory relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-4\">This court assesses the trial court\u2019s ruling de novo, applying the same analysis as the superior court. <em>(Johnson v. City of Loma Linda </em>(2000) 24 Cal.4th 61, 65, 67-68 [99 Cal.Rptr.2d 316, 5 P.3d 874]; <em>Norgan </em>v. <em>Upjohn Co. </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 383, 404 [87 Cal.Rptr.2d 453, 981 P.2d 79]; <em>Buss v. Superior Court </em>(1997) 16 Cal.4th 35, 60, 65 [65 Cal.Rptr.2d 366, 939 P.2d 766]; <em>Silva v. Lucky Stores, Inc. </em>(1998) 65 Cal.App.4th 256, 261 [76 Cal.Rptr.2d 382].) We construe the moving party\u2019s affidavits strictly and the opponent\u2019s affidavits liberally and resolve any doubts as to the propriety of granting the motion in favor of the opponent. <em>(Silva v. Lucky Stores, Inc., </em>at p. 261.) On appeal from a ruling on a motion for summary judgment we are not bound by the trial court\u2019s stated reasons for its ruling on the motion; we review only the trial court\u2019s ruling and not its rationale. <em>(D\u2019Amico v. Board of Medical Examiners </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 1, 18-19 [112 Cal.Rptr. 786, 520 P.2d 10]; <em>Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond of La Jolla, Inc. v.

Bank of Italy etc. </em>(1932) 123 Cal.App. 564, 567 [11 P.2d 650].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-5\">II. <em>Ponsor\u2019s Motion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1122-6\">We first conclude the court correctly granted summary judgment in favor of Ponsor given the lack of an actual, present controversy between it and Gafcon for which declaratory relief might have been appropriate. There is no dispute that as of November 1999, well before Gafcon filed its second amended complaint, Ponsor had been relieved as counsel and no longer represented Gafcon. Any relationship between Ponsor and Gafcon, and thus any controversy vis-a-vis those parties, had terminated by that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1403\">*1403</page-number> Gafcon\u2019s second amended complaint sought only declaratory relief against Ponsor.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>\n                   The controversy that is the subject of declaratory relief \u201c \u2018 \u201c \u2018must be of a character which admits of specific and conclusive relief by judgment within the field of judicial determination, as distinguished from an advisory opinion upon a particular or hypothetical state of facts . . . .\u2019 \u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Bame v. City of Del Mar </em>(2001) 86 Cal.App.4th 1346, 1355 [104 Cal.Rptr.2d 183].) \u201cThe judgment must decree, not suggest, what the parties may or may not do. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Selby Realty Co. v. City of San Buenaventura </em>(1973) 10 Cal.3d 110, 117 [109 Cal.Rptr. 799, 514 P.2d 111].) Moreover, declaratory relief \u201c \u2018operates prospectively, and not merely for the redress of past wrongs. It serves to set controversies at rest before they lead to repudiation of obligations, invasion of rights or commission of wrongs; in short, the remedy is to be used in the interests of preventive justice, to declare rights rather than execute them.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Babb v. Superior Court </em>(1971) 3 Cal.3d 841, 848 [92 Cal.Rptr. 179, 479 P.2d 379], quoting <em>Travers </em>v. <em>Louden </em>(1967) 254 Cal.App.2d 926, 931 [62 Cal.Rptr. 654].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-4\">\u201c \u2018The principle that courts will not entertain an action which is not founded on an actual controversy is a tenet of common law jurisprudence, the precise content of which is difficult to define and hard to apply. ... A controversy is \u201cripe\u201d when it has reached, <em>but has not passed, </em>the point that the facts have sufficiently congealed to permit an intelligent and useful decision to be made.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Alameda County Land Use Assn. v. City of Hayward </em>(1995) 38 Cal.App.4th 1716, 1722 [45 Cal.Rptr.2d 752], quoting <em>California Water &amp; Telephone Co. v. County of Los Angeles </em>(1967) 253 Cal.App.2d 16, 22 [61 Cal.Rptr. 618], italics added.) Even where a particular matter is an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1404\">*1404</page-number>inherently proper subject of declaratory relief, \u201c \u2018 \u201c \u2018a declaratory judgment may not be rendered in respect to [such a matter] in disregard of the customary limitations upon the granting of such relief.\u2019 \u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Bame </em>v. <em>City of Del Mar, supra, </em>86 Cal.App.4th at p. 1355, quoting <em>Redwood Coast Watersheds Alliance v. State Bd. of Forestry &amp; Fire Protection </em>(1999) 70 Cal.App.4th 962, 968 [83 Cal.Rptr.2d 24].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-4\">Gafcon\u2019s declaratory relief claims were premised on its theory that Travelers\u2019 use of in-house counsel constituted the practice of law by Travelers; that given the conflict created by Travelers\u2019 use of Ponsor, Gafcon was entitled to independent counsel; and that Ponsor and Travelers engaged in improper fee splitting. As to Ponsor, Gafcon\u2019s concern was that Ponsor would place Travelers\u2019 interests over its own and operate under impaired judgment. Yet Ponsor\u2019s actions could negatively impact Gafcon only so long as it acted on Gafcon\u2019s behalf in the Association\u2019s action. As for Gafcon\u2019s request for independent counsel and reimbursement for its having to retain independent counsel, that controversy is between Gafcon and its insurer Travelers. When Ponsor was relieved as Gafcon\u2019s counsel, any harm occurring to Gafcon resulting from Ponsor\u2019s purported inadequate representation or assistance to Travelers ended. Because declaratory relief operates prospectively only, rather than to redress past wrongs, Gafcon\u2019s remedy as against Ponsor lies in pursuit of a fully matured cause of action for money, if any exists at all. <em>(Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co. v. Maryland Casualty Co. </em>(1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 1586, 1593, fn. 5 [26 Cal.Rptr.2d 762].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-5\">III. <em>Travelers\u2019 Motion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1124-6\">Our conclusion regarding the lack of an actual controversy appropriate for declaratory relief does not extend to the causes of action between Gafcon and Travelers. Their insurer/insured relationship did not end upon Ponsor\u2019s withdrawal from the action, nor would it necessarily expire upon the conclusion of the underlying lawsuit. Moreover, declaratory relief is appropriate where \u201cquestions of public interest... are involved.\u201d <em>(Collier v. Lindley </em>(1928) 203 Cal. 641, 645 [266 P. 526]; accord, <em>Pacific Legal Foundation v. California Coastal Com. </em>(1982) 33 Cal.3d 158, 170 [188 Cal.Rptr. 104, 655 P.2d 306].) The use of in-house or staff counsel by insurance companies to represent insureds has become more commonplace in recent years,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and necessarily raises the issue whether the mere fact of such an employment relationship between counsel and insurer gives rise to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1405\">*1405</page-number>the unauthorized practice of law by the insurer. We exercise our discretion to consider it here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-4\">A. <em>Practice of Law by Travelers</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1125-5\">Gafcon advances the broad proposition that insurance companies that employ lawyers to defend their insureds against third party claims engage in the unauthorized practice of law. It argues generally that absent qualification as a certified law corporation (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 6127.5), such a practice is barred by Business and Professions Code section 6125.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In fact, its contention rests on the separate but related notion that a \u201clay\u201d corporation cannot practice law or any other profession implicating duties of loyalty and confidentiality. In support of this contention, Gafcon cites <em>People v. Merchants Protective Corp. </em>(1922) 189 Cal. 531 [209 P. 363] <em>(Merchants Protective), </em>a 1922 California Supreme Court opinion, and subsequent cases that hold a corporation may not \u201cemploy competent attorneys to practice for it.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>California Protective Corp. </em>(1926) 76 Cal.App. 354 [244 P. 1089] <em>(California Protective).) </em>Under these authorities, Gafcon essentially seeks a per se prohibition against staff counsel acting on an insured\u2019s behalf, on the theory they are agents of the insurance company and it is in effect the unlicensed insurance company that indirectly renders the services, not the licensed attorneys.</p>\n<p id=\"b1126-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1406\">*1406</page-number>In response, Travelers concedes a corporation may not employ lawyers for customers where the corporation has no direct interest in the dispute at issue. It maintains its practice of employing lawyers to protect its own as well as its insureds\u2019 interests is distinguishable and has gained acceptance as evidenced by State Bar Opinion 1987-91, which expressly concludes an insurance company\u2019s in-house counsel may represent insureds in litigation without violating the prohibition against aiding the unauthorized practice of law, provided, among other things, the insurance company does not interfere with counsel\u2019s professional independence or have in-house counsel also advise it on coverage issues concerning the insured. Travelers argues further that the undisputed facts demonstrate it did not engage in any conduct falling within any of the proscribed activities under State Bar Opinion 1987-91.</p>\n<p id=\"b1126-4\">We reject the notion that an insurance company\u2019s mere employment of attorneys to represent its insureds constituted the practice of law by the insurance company itself. Gafcon\u2019s analysis ignores a critical element of the equation: the relationship between insurer, insured and counsel retained or employed by the insurer to act on the insureds\u2019 behalf. When an insurance company in California arranges for a law firm to defend an insured under a contractual duty to do so under an insurance policy (regardless of whether that law firm is retained outside counsel or in-house counsel employed by the insurer), counsel is acting on the insurer\u2019s behalf and representing the insurer\u2019s own rights and interests as well as those of its insured. It is because of this distinction that we reach our limited holding in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1126-5\">1. <em>The Tripartite Insurer-Attomey-Insured Relationship</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1126-6\">In California, it is settled that absent a conflict of interest, an attorney retained by an insurance company to defend its insured under the insurer\u2019s contractual obligation to do so represents and owes a fiduciary duty to both the insurer and insured. <em>(State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Federal Ins. Co. </em>(1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 1422, 1428-1429 [86 Cal.Rptr.2d 20]; <em>National Union Fire Ins. Co. v.

Superior Court </em>(1974) 38 Cal.App.3d 579, 591-592 [113 Cal.Rptr. 561], the court elaborated on the interests of the parties within this relationship: \u201cIn the insured-insurer relationship, the attorney characteristically is engaged and paid by the carrier to defend the insured. The insured and the insurer have certain obligations each to the other . . . arising from the insurance contract. Both the insured and the carrier have a common interest in defeating or settling the third party\u2019s claim. If the matter reaches litigation, the attorney appears of record for the insured and at all times represents him in terms measured by the extent of his employment. [H In such a situation, the attorney has two clients whose primary, overlapping and common interest is the speedy and successful resolution of the claim and litigation. Conceptually, each member of the trio, attorney, client-insured, and client-insurer has corresponding rights and obligations founded largely on contract, and as to the attorney, by the Rules of Professional Conduct as well. The three parties may be viewed as a loose partnership, coalition or alliance directed toward a common goal, sharing a common purpose which lasts during the pendency of the claim or litigation against the insured. Communications are routinely exchanged between them relating to the joint and common purpose\u2014the successful defense and resolution of the claim. Insured, carrier, and attorney, together form an entity\u2014the defense team\u2014arising from the obligations to defend and to cooperate, imposed by contract and professional duty. This entity may be conceived as comprising a unitary whole with intramural relationships and reciprocal obligations and duties each to the other quite separate and apart from the extramural relations with third parties or with the world at large. Together, the team occupies one side of the litigating arena.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1127-5\">In certain circumstances (discussed more fully in pt. IDLC, <em>post) </em>a conflict of interest between insurer and insured will trigger the insured\u2019s right to retain independent counsel at the insurer\u2019s expense. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 2860, subd. (b).) But until such a conflict arises, the insurer has the right to control defense and settlement of the third party action against its insured, and is generally a direct participant in the litigation. <em>(James 3 Corp. v.

In the context of the parallel doctrine of corporate practice of medicine, this court noted the \u201c \u2018principal evils\u2019 \u201d thought to spring from the doctrine are \u201c \u2018the conflict between the professional standards and obligations of the doctors and the profit motive of the corporation employer.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Conrad </em>v. <em>Medical Bd. of California </em>(1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 1038, 1041, fn. 2 [55 Cal.Rptr.2d 901], quoting <em>People </em>v. <em>Pacific Health Corp. </em>(1938) 12 Cal.2d 156, 158, 160 [82 P.2d 429, 119 A.L.R. 1284]; <em>Steinsmith v.

(See <em>California Protective, supra, </em>76 Cal.App. at p. 360 [a corporation providing legal services to its patrons for a fee constitutes the unauthorized practice of law; \u201c[a] corporation can neither practice law nor hire lawyers to carry on the business of practicing law for it\u201d]; see also <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Board of Dental Examiners </em>(1932) 216 Cal. 285, 298 [14 P.2d 67] [\u201cThat a corporation may not engage in the practice of the law, medicine, or dentistry is a settled question in this state.

Carpenter </em>(1935) 10 Cal.App.2d 592, 595 [52 P.2d 992].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1128-5\">As Travelers points out, the early cases involving the corporate practice of law dealt with circumstances where the corporate entity was created for the sole purpose of retaining counsel for its customers. In <em>Merchants Protective, </em>a quo warranto proceeding, the state challenged the practices of a corporate entity known as the Lawyers\u2019 Institute of San Diego as constituting the practice of law. The corporation was specifically formed for the purpose of having individuals, other firms and corporations pay a set price for the services of a central organization that would appoint attorneys to handle collections and \u201c \u2018render such other professional services as is needed and required by the various members and subscribers thereto.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Merchants Protective, supra, </em>189 Cal. at p. 532.) The court held the corporation, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1409\">*1409</page-number>employed attorneys as its agents and representatives to dispense legal advice and counsel, was indeed engaged in the practice of law. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 538.) Adopting the reasoning of the Washington Supreme Court in <em>State ex rel. Lundin </em>v. <em>Merchants Protective Corp. </em>(1919) 105 Wash. 12 [177 P. 694], it held: \u201c \u2018The practice of law is not a business that is open to a commercial corporation. \u201cSince, as has been seen, the practice of the law is not a lawful business except for members of the bar who have complied with all the conditions required by statute and the rules of the court, and as these conditions cannot be performed by a corporation it follows that the practice of law is not a lawful business for a corporation to engage in. As it cannot practice law directly it cannot do so indirectly by employing competent lawyers to practice for it, as that would be an evasion which the law will not tolerate.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Merchants Protective, </em>189 Cal. at p. 538.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1129-4\">In <em>California Protective, </em>another quo warranto proceeding, the entity was incorporated for the purpose of \u201c \u2018collecting] debts due to its members or clients. . . . employing] attorneys for its said members or clients, and . . . paying] for such legal services for and on behalf of its said members or clients.\u2019 \u201d\u2022 <em>(California Protective, supra, 76 </em>Cal.App. at p. 358.) Its clientele paid yearly fees for the services of lawyers to, among other things, give \u201c \u2018[l]egal advice and consultation on ail business, personal and private matters at the attorney\u2019s office.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 359.) The court followed <em>Merchants Protective </em>and concluded the corporation was unquestionably engaged in the unlawful practice of law. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 360.) It reasoned: \u201cIt is true that individuals who are duly licensed members of the bar may \u2018lawfully\u2019 associate themselves in any unincorporated form of association, such as a partnership, for the practice of law. But such individuals may not associate themselves for the practice of law under the aegis of a corporation. Though all the directors and officers of the corporation be duly licensed members of the legal profession, the practice of law by the corporation would be illegal nevertheless. At any time those directors and officers, by death or by the transfer of their shares, might be succeeded by laymen none of whom possessed the right to practice law.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 360-361.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1129-5\">Several premises underlie the corporate practice doctrine. One is that the corporation will always exercise impermissible control over the employee-attorney\u2019s judgment and thus improperly interfere with his or her independence of judgment and loyalty to the client. Another is that the employee-attorney will necessarily be influenced by his or her employer and allow his or her judgment or independent decisionmaking to be impaired.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The concern is that an attorney-employee will not be able to abide by his or her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1410\">*1410</page-number>duties to remain loyal to his client and avoid conflicts of interest, protect client confidences and maintain independence of judgment. Such duties are of paramount importance in the practice of law. <em>(In re Jordan </em>(1974) 12 Cal.3d 575, 580 [116 Cal.Rptr. 371, 526 P.2d 523].) In <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Eaton </em>(1930) 211 Cal. 113 [293 P. 788], the California Supreme Court laid down the framework of an attorney\u2019s duties of confidentiality and loyalty in a case involving an attorney\u2019s concurrent representation of a plaintiff in a wrongful death action on behalf of their son\u2019s estate and of the insurance company representing the son\u2019s employer in worker\u2019s compensation proceedings: \u201cOne of the principal obligations which bind an attorney is that of fidelity, the maintaining inviolate the confidence reposed in him by those who employ him, and at every peril to himself to preserve the secrets of his client. [Citation.] This obligation is a very high and stringent one. It is also an attorney\u2019s duty to protect his client in every possible way, and it is a violation of that duty for him to assume a position adverse or antagonistic to his client without the . . . knowledge of all the facts and circumstances. [Citation.] By virtue of this rule, an attorney is precluded from assuming any relation which would prevent him from devoting his entire energies to his client\u2019s interests. Nor does it matter that the intention and motives of the attorney are honest. The rule is designed, not alone to prevent the dishonest practitioner from fraudulent conduct, but as well to preclude the honest practitioner from putting himself in a position where he may be required to choose between conflicting duties, or be led to an attempt to reconcile conflicting interests, rather than to enforce to their full extent the rights of the interest which he should alone represent.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 116; see also <em>Flatt v. Superior Court </em>(1994) 9 Cal.4th 275, 288-289 [36 Cal.Rptr.2d 537, 885 P.2d 950].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-4\">These basic and paramount obligations of an attorney to his or her client have not changed since our high court decided <em>Merchants Protective </em>and <em>California Protective. </em>And they are reflected in various statutes, as well as the State Bar Rules of Professional Conduct. <em>(In re Jordan </em>(1972) 7 Cal.3d 930, 940-941 [103 Cal.Rptr. 849, 500 P.2d 873]; Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 6068, subd. (e) [every attorney has a duty \u201c[t]o maintain inviolate the confidence, and at every peril to himself or herself to preserve the secrets, of his or her client\u201d].) But other changes have taken place in the practice of law since these cases were decided. It is simply no longer true that lawyers may not practice in a corporate framework. (See Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 6160, 6161, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1411\">*1411</page-number>6161.1.) Not-for-profit corporate entities provide legal services to third parties, and, therefore, under the reasoning of <em>Merchants Protective, </em>practice law. (See Corp. Code, \u00a7 10830.)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Corporations employ in-house lawyers to defend their interests in and outside of court. Gafcon does not challenge the general proposition that a corporation may represent its own interests in court through counsel who is practicing law in a representative capacity. (See <em>Woodruff v. McDonald\u2019s Restaurants </em>(1977) 75 Cal.App.3d 655, 657-658 [142 Cal.Rptr. 367] [\u201cThe record reflects that defendant, McDonald\u2019s Restaurants, is a corporation. As such, it had no authority to appear in the superior court except through a licensed attorney.\u201d]; see also <em>Merco Construction Engineers, Inc. v. Municipal Court </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 724, 730 [147 Cal.Rptr. 631, 581 P.2d 636] [\u201cA corporation cannot in fact appear in court except through an agent.\u201d (italics omitted)].) In <em>Estate of Miller </em>(1936) 5 Cal.2d 588 [55 P.2d 491], the California Supreme Court held the rendering of legal services by a county counsel to a public administrator in his official capacity did not constitute practice of law by a corporation, nor did it violate provisions of the State Bar Act. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 595.) The court reasoned that the county counsel is performing an official duty for the benefit of a county officer and is not representing a private individual or carrying on a private law practice for the benefit of the county. <em>(Ibid.) </em>\u201cThe county is no more practicing law in this case than when the County Counsel represents the county or a school district in court .... The County Counsel ... of course, practice^] law . . . but it is they who are practicing law, not the county.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 595-596.) Further, the court pointed out that the county has a material financial interest in estates handled by the public administrator. It concluded: \u201cThe prohibition against a corporation practicing law does not preclude a corporation from employing attorneys in any litigation in which it has a financial interest.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 597.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1131-4\">None of these evolutions permit lawyers representing corporate entities or performing legal services for third parties to violate or disregard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1412\">*1412</page-number>obligations otherwise imposed by the Rules of Professional Conduct. (E.g., Corp. Code, \u00a7 10830 [corporation may not perform corporate purposes unless the attorneys furnishing professional services are acting in compliance with the Rules of Professional Conduct].) All lawyers, whether employed by a corporation or by an independent law firm that is retained by a corporate entity, are bound by the same fiduciary and ethical duties to their clients. <em>(PLCM Group, Inc. </em>v. <em>Drexler </em>(2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1094 [95 Cal.Rptr.2d 198, 997 P.2d 511], citing <em>General Dynamics Corp. v. Superior Court, supra, 7 </em>Cal.4th at p. 1190 [32 Cal.Rptr.2d 1, 876 P.2d 487].) \u201cBoth [in-house and private counsel] are qualified to provide, and do provide, equivalent legal services.\u201d <em>(PLCM Group, Inc. </em>v. <em>Drexler, </em>at p. 1094.) And all must comply with the Rules of Professional Conduct, including in those instances where counsel undertakes dual representation of the insurer and insured. For example, rule 1-600 of the Rules of Professional Conduct expressly addresses the concern arising from a nongovernmental entity that furnishes or pays for legal services, prohibiting any licensed attorney from belonging to any organization that interferes with his or her independent professional judgment. (Rules Prof. Conduct, rule 1-600 [\u201cA member shall not participate in a nongovernmental program, activity, or organization furnishing, recommending, or paying for legal services, which allows any third person or organization to interfere with the member\u2019s independence of professional judgment, or with the client-lawyer relationship, or allows unlicensed persons to practice law, or allows any third person or organization to receive directly or indirectly any part of the consideration paid to the member except as permitted by these rules, or otherwise violates the State Bar Act or these rules\u201d].) It is true, the \u201cdiscussion\u201d section of rule 1-600 provides: \u201cRule 1-600 is not intended to override any contractual agreement or relationship between insurers and insureds regarding the provision of legal services.\u201d (Discussion, 23 pt. 3 West\u2019s Ann. Codes, Rules (1996 ed.) foll, rule 1-600, p. 340.) But we disagree with Travelers\u2019 assertion that insurers and insureds are entirely exempted from this rule\u2019s proscriptions. The clarification in the discussion section cannot be read to permit\u2014in the context of an insurer/insured relationship\u2014an unlicensed adjuster to practice law or the insurer to interfere with an attorney\u2019s independence of professional judgment. (Discussion, 23 pt. 3 West\u2019s Ann. Codes, Rules, <em>supra, </em>foll, rule 1-600, p. 340.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1132-4\">Because the general ban on the corporate practice of law reflected in <em>Merchants Protective </em>and <em>California Protective </em>is subject to these exceptions, it is evident that the \u201cchinks in the armor\u201d of the corporate practice doctrine that this court found in the context of medical practice <em>(Conrad v. Medical Board of California, supra, </em>48 Cal.App.4th at p. 1044) now extend to the legal profession. The California State Bar Standing Committee on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1413\">*1413</page-number>Professional Responsibility and Conduct recognized this in 1987 when it issued its opinion noting the <em>Merchants Protective </em>and <em>California Protective </em>decisions had not \u201coutlasted the evolution of prepaid medical and legal service programs which, under these authorities, would theoretically violate the prohibition against corporations practicing law.\u201d (State Bar Opinion No. 1987-91, <em>supra, </em>1987 WL 109707, *2.) The Committee summed up its opinion as follows: \u201cIn-house counsel for an insurer may represent insureds in litigation without violating the prohibition against aiding the unauthorized practice of law set forth in rule 3-101(A). However, the attorneys must be certain that the insurance company does not control or interfere with the exercise of professional judgment in representing insureds, that any fees are not split with the insurance company or any other third parties, that case[s] involving conflicts of interest are referred to outside counsel, and that the firm name used by in-house counsel is not false, deceptive or misleading.\u201d (State Bar Opinion No. 1987-91, <em>supra, </em>1987 WL 109707, *1.) More specifically, the committee found an insurance company\u2019s use of salaried employee attorneys working within a \u201claw division\u201d to represent insureds does not violate the corporate practice doctrine as long as attorneys within the law division (1) do not permit the division to \u201cbecome a front or subterfuge for lay adjustors or other unlicensed personnel to practice law\u201d; (2) adequately supervise nonattomey personnel working under the attorneys\u2019 supervision; (3) function as a separate law firm as much as possible; (4) take steps to guarantee that illegal fee splitting with the insurer does not occur; (5) cease representing the insured or insurer in the event of a conflict of interest absent their mutual consent; (6) never represent insureds while simultaneously advising the insurer on coverage aspects of the representation; or (7) use a law firm name without indicating the relationship between the firm and the law division on its letterhead. (State Bar Opinion No. 1987-91, <em>supra, </em>1987 WL 109707, **4, 5, 6.)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1134-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1414\">*1414</page-number>We are not bound by an ethics opinion, and we need not adopt it in full for our holding in this case.  It is sufficient here to recognize that (1) an insurance company has a direct pecuniary interest in the underlying third party action against its insured and (2) having such an interest, it is entitled to have counsel represent its own interests as well as those of its insured, as long as their interests are aligned. In the present situation, the insurer is representing its own interests through licensed attorneys who also happen to be its employees. Counsel\u2019s status as a salaried employee of the insurer does not inherently create a temptation to violate or disregard ethical rules.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We reject the argument that such a relationship supports the presumption that in-house counsel will always favor the insurer\u2019s interests. Conflicts of interests may arise in such circumstances, but the same is true for an outside law firm that might be dependent upon a particular insurance company for a substantial amount of business.</p>\n<p id=\"b1135-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1415\">*1415</page-number>3. <em>The Record Demonstrates That Travelers Did Not Engage in the Practice of Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1135-5\">Notwithstanding the breadth of the judicial declaration sought by Gafcon, the question presented is a narrow one, confined to the record before us. We decline to render an advisory opinion purporting to extend to all circumstances in which an insurance company utilizes employee attorneys to represent its insured in third party actions. Instead, we assess only whether the trial court could properly determine based upon undisputed facts that Travelers was not engaged in the practice of law due to Ponsor\u2019s brief representation of Gafcon in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1135-6\">Travelers\u2019 evidence (the declarations of von Kaesborg and Lightbody) demonstrated that the only involvement or decisionmaking Travelers had with respect to Ponsor\u2019s defense of the Association\u2019s action was to designate that law firm as Gafcon\u2019s counsel. Travelers did not influence or interfere with von Kaesborg\u2019s professional judgment. It did not \u201climit or restrict\u201d von Kaesborg\u2019s ability to represent Gafcon in the underlying litigation or that of any other Ponsor <em>&amp; </em>Associates lawyer. Von Kaesborg did not participate in any investigation or determination with regard to Travelers\u2019 insurance coverage. There is no evidence Travelers directed or controlled Ponsor\u2019s representation in any way. These undisputed facts lead us to conclude that Travelers met its burden to show Gafcon was not entitled to a judicial declaration that Travelers impermissibly engaged in the practice of law. The undisputed evidence demonstrates nothing more than Ponsor\u2019s employment relationship and the agency status created by that relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b1135-7\">Gafcon sought to dispute von Kaesborg\u2019s claim he was free to exercise his professional judgment by pointing to the fact he prepared a declaration that Travelers submitted \u201cin opposition to Gafcon\u2019s complaint\u201d before he filed a declaration on his own behalf. Gafcon surmised in its separate statement that his declaration had to have been \u201crequired\u201d by Travelers, and \u201cthus\u201d interfered with his professional judgment. Gafcon further argued that additional discovery would show Ponsor was required to follow \u201crestrictions on the practice of law similar to those insisted upon by Travelers with respect to panel counsel.\u201d Gafcon points to no evidence in support of these argumentative and vague assertions other than Travelers\u2019 panel counsel manual and \u201cConstruction Defect Expert Retention and Billing Guidelines,\u201d which, by Gafcon\u2019s own concession, apply only to Travelers\u2019 panel counsel. These documents are insufficient to create a dispute as to whether Travelers in some manner controlled Ponsor\u2019s professional judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1135-8\">B. <em>Fee Splitting</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1135-9\">Gafcon\u2019s third cause of action sought a judicial declaration that insurance companies profit directly and indirectly by using staff counsel to represent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1416\">*1416</page-number>its insureds, and that .Rules of Professional Conduct, rule 1-600 prohibited \u201cthe type of financial arrangement that exists between insurance companies and their staff counsel.\u201d Gafcon contends Travelers\u2019 practice of charging other insurance companies for the services of its staff counsel violates rules 1-600 and 1-320(A) of the Rules of Professional Conduct, which, respectively, prohibit attorneys from participating in any organization that \u201callows any third person or organization to receive directly or indirectly any part of the consideration paid to the member except as permitted by these rules . . .\u2019\u2019or \u201cdirectly or indirectly shar[ing] legal fees\u201d with a person who is not a lawyer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1136-4\">We note preliminarily that Gafcon points out the trial court failed to address its claim regarding fee splitting. Interpreting this assertion as an argument that the judgment must be reversed for the trial court\u2019s failure to address Gafcon\u2019s request for declaratory relief on this point, we reject it. Because our review is de novo, the only question before us is whether the record establishes Gafcon\u2019s entitlement to the declaration sought. (See <em>Ruoff v. Harbor Creek Community Assn. </em>(1992) 10 Cal.App.4th 1624, 1627-1628 [13 Cal.Rptr.2d 755]; cf., e.g., <em>Hagen v. Hickenbottom </em>(1995) 41 Cal.App.4th 168, 178 [48 Cal.Rptr.2d 197]; <em>Goldrich </em>v. <em>Natural Y Surgical Specialties, Inc. </em>(1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 772, 782 [31 Cal.Rptr.2d 162].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1136-5\">Reaching the merits, we conclude Gafcon has not met its burden to raise a triable issue of material fact as to its claim Ponsor and Travelers illegally split fees through Travelers\u2019 sharing of its costs with other insurers. In support of its motion, Travelers presented von Kaesborg\u2019s declaration, in which he averred that \u201cat no time\u201d did he or his law firm split fees with Travelers. In opposition to this evidence, Gafcon pointed to deposition testimony by Dennis Ponsor in which he generally discussed instances where other carriers share in Travelers\u2019 litigation expenses. Dennis Ponsor stated that in such cases, his law firm sends a bill to those other carriers who make out a check payable to Travelers and give it to Ponsor, which then records the information and forwards the bill to Travelers\u2019 claims department. Gafcon also referred to a declaration from James DiVirgilio, Travelers\u2019 deputy general counsel, in which DiVirgilio similarly averred that in instances where a Travelers insured is also insured by one or more other carriers, the expense of staff counsel is allocated between Travelers and those insurers. DiVirgilio explained the hourly rate for Travelers\u2019 staff counsel was based on \u201can estimate of the actual cost of such staff counsel, including overhead\u201d and this was the rate other carriers were charged when fees were allocated; that Travelers did not \u201cmarkup\u201d the cost of its staff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1417\">*1417</page-number>counsel and made no profit from its use of their services. He asserted Travelers \u201cunder-recovered\u2019 for its staff counsel expenses in 1998 and 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-4\">Gafcon has not presented evidence demonstrating that Travelers\u2019 sharing of Ponsor\u2019s costs with other insurers constitutes the sharing of legal fees as opposed to simply contribution for the insurers\u2019 respective defense cost obligations.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The only conduct Travelers is engaged in is collecting reimbursement for Ponsor\u2019s actual costs to Travelers, including overhead, from other responsible insurers. We disagree with Gafcon\u2019s argument that Travelers\u2019 receipt of those monies constitutes its receipt of \u201cpart of the consideration paid to the member\u201d within the meaning of rule 1-600 of the Rules of Professional Conduct. That Ponsor acts as a conduit in collecting and forwarding the other insurers\u2019 portion of its expenses does not convert those monies into legal fees, as opposed to Travelers\u2019 costs, the sharing of which Gafcon concedes is authorized under Rules of Professional Conduct, rule 3-310(F).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1138-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1418\">*1418</page-number>Moreover, there is no evidence the sharing of Ponsor\u2019s expenses in this case offends the policies underlying the rules against improper fee splitting. (See, e.g., <em>Emmons, Williams, Mires &amp; Leech v. State Bar </em>(1970) 6 Cal.App.3d 565, 573 [86 Cal.Rptr. 367] [listing the dangers of fee splitting prohibited by Rules of Prof. Conduct, former rule 3 and noting the rule seeks to bar both solicitation and the presence of a party demanding allegiance the lawyer owes his client].) One of those policies is to avoid instances of control over litigation by a layperson more interested in his or her own profit than the client\u2019s fate. (See <em>Gassman </em>v. <em>State Bar </em>(1976) 18 Cal.3d 125, 131 [132 Cal.Rptr. 675, 553 P.2d 1147]; <em>In re Arnoff </em>(1978) 22 Cal.3d 740, 748, fn. 4 [150 Cal.Rptr. 479, 586 P.2d 960]; <em>Utz </em>v. <em>State Bar </em>(1942) 21 Cal.2d 100, 108 [130 P.2d 377] [rules against fee splitting prohibit arrangements where attorneys accept employment solicited by a layperson intermediary who has entered into an agreement with an injured person having a legal claim and where attorney and solicitor share on a contingent basis in the proceeds of the attorney\u2019s employment].) Another is to avoid facilitating a layperson intermediary\u2019s tendency to select attorneys who will compensate him and not the most competent attorney for the client. (See <em>Linnick v. State Bar </em>(1964) 62 Cal.2d 17, 21 [41 Cal.Rptr. 1, 396 P.2d 33].) As Gafcon acknowledges, these policies are concerned with ensuring the best interests of the client remain paramount.</p>\n<p id=\"b1138-4\">We have already concluded Gafcon has not shown Travelers exerted any influence or control over Ponsor\u2019s professional judgment or advice during its brief representation, and, as we explain more fully below (pt. III.D, <em>post), </em>Gafcon has not rebutted Travelers\u2019 showing it did not profit from its use of Ponsor\u2019s services in this case. The absence of economic benefit to Travelers in recovering Ponsor\u2019s expenses in particular compels us to conclude it did not engage in fee splitting. It is now settled that a corporation may recover fees incurred by its in-house counsel. In <em>PLCM Group, Inc. v. Drexler, supra, </em>22 Cal.4th 1084, the court held a corporation may recover fees for attorneys within its legal department under Civil Code section 1717 under prevailing market rates for attorney services. <em>(PLCM Group, Inc. v. Drexler, supra, </em>at pp. 1093-1094, relying in part on <em>Garfield Bank v. Folb </em>(1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 1804 [31 Cal.Rptr.2d 239], disapproved on other grounds in <em>Trope </em>v. <em>Katz </em>(1995) 11 Cal.4th 274, 292 [45 Cal.Rptr.2d 241, 902 P.2d 259].) In a concurring and dissenting opinion, Justice Chin urged the corporation\u2019s fee recovery be limited to actual costs including overhead to avoid permitting a corporation to profit from its legal department, which would implicate the proscription against fee splitting. <em>(PLCM Group, Inc. v. Drexler, supra, </em>22 Cal.4th at p. 1106 (cone. &amp; dis. opn. of Chin, J.).) He pointed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1419\">*1419</page-number>out that several state and federal courts have held a market rate fee award implicates these proscriptions to the extent it enables a corporation to profit from its legal department. <em>(Ibid) </em>As stated, Travelers\u2019 recovery from other insurers is limited to actual cost plus overhead; indeed it recovered less than Ponsor\u2019s actual costs to Travelers in 1998 and 1999. Its arrangement does not implicate the concerns over unethical fee splitting raised by Justice Chin.</p>\n<p id=\"b1139-4\">Emphasizing that we limit our consideration of the question to the facts presented here, we conclude Gafcon\u2019s evidence did not raise a triable issue of fact regarding any possibility of fee splitting between Travelers and Ponsor in connection with Ponsor\u2019s work in the Association\u2019s action. Accordingly, Gafcon is not entitled to its sought-after judicial declaration on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b1139-5\">C. <em>Conflict of Interest Triggering Travelers\u2019 Duty to Pay for Independent Counsel</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1139-6\">Gafcon\u2019s fourth cause of action sought a declaration as to whether the facts and claims within the underlying lawsuit presented a conflict of interest triggering Travelers\u2019 obligation to pay for independent <em>Cumis </em>counsel. Gafcon contends it presented evidence raising a triable issue of fact that Ponsor at the outset operated under such a conflict in its dual representation of both Travelers and Gafcon in the Association\u2019s lawsuit. We do not reach Gafcon\u2019s contention because we conclude Travelers did not conclusively establish the absence of a conflict sufficient to support summary judgment in its favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1139-7\">Our analysis of an insurer\u2019s duty to pay for independent counsel begins with <em>Cumis, supra, </em>162 Cal.App.3d 358. In <em>Cumis, </em>this court held, \u201c[wjhere there are divergent interests of the insured and the insurer brought about by the insurer\u2019s reservation of rights based on possible noncoverage under the insurance policy, the insurer must pay the reasonable cost for hiring independent counsel by the insured.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 375.) There, the underlying action included claims for tortious wrongful discharge and intentional infliction of emotional distress. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 361.) The insurer provided its own counsel to defend the insured, but reserved its rights to disclaim coverage for willful misconduct and denied any coverage for punitive damages. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 362.) Noting it was uncontested that the basis for the insured\u2019s liability \u201cmight rest on conduct excluded by the terms of the insurance policy\u201d and that the insurer\u2019s own counsel were privy to investigation and client communication that could provide information directly relating to the coverage issue, we held a conflict of interest arises \u201conce the insurer takes the view a coverage issue is present.\u201d We explained: \u201cIn the usual tripartite relationship existing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1420\">*1420</page-number>between insurer, insured and counsel, there is a single, common interest shared among them. Dual representation by counsel is beneficial since the shared goal of minimizing or eliminating liability to a third party is the same. A different situation is presented, however, when some or all of the allegations in the complaint do not fall within the scope of coverage under the policy. In such a case, the standard practice of an insurer is to defend under a reservation of rights where the insurer promises to defend but states it may not indemnify the insured if liability is found. In this situation, there may be little commonality of interest. Opposing poles of interest are represented on the one hand in the insurer\u2019s desire to establish in the third party suit the insured\u2019s \u2018liability rested on intentional conduct\u2019 [citation], and thus no coverage under the policy, and on the other hand in the insured\u2019s desire to \u2018obtain a ruling . . . such liability emanated from the nonintentional conduct within his insurance coverage\u2019 [citation], . . . Although issues of coverage under the policy are not actually litigated in the third party suit, this does not detract from the force of these opposing interests as they operate on the attorney selected by the insurer, who has a dual agency status [citation].\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 364-365, fns. omitted.) More generally, <em>Cumis </em>observed that an attorney having such dual agency status is subject to the rule that a \u201c \u2018[c]onflict of interest between jointly represented clients occurs whenever their common lawyer\u2019s representation of the one is rendered less effective by reason of his representation of the other.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Cumis, supra, </em>162 Cal.App.3d at p. 365, fn. 4, quoting <em>Spindle v. Chubb/Pacific Indemnity Group </em>(1979) 89 Cal.App.3d 706, 713 [152 Cal.Rptr. 776].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1140-4\">In 1987, the Legislature enacted Civil Code section 2860, which codified the right to independent or <em>Cumis </em>counsel but \u201cclarifi[ed]\u201dand \u201climit[ed]\u201d Cumis's stated rights and responsibilities of insurer and insured. <em>(Buss v. Superior Court, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at p. 59; <em>James 3 Corp. </em>v. <em>Truck Ins. Exhange, supra, </em>91 Cal.App.4th at p. 1101.) Under the statute, an insurer having a duty to defend its insured must provide its insured independent counsel when a \u201cconflict of interest arises which creates a duty on the part of the insurer to provide independent counsel to the insured\u201d unless \u201cat the time the insured is informed that a possible conflict may arise or does exist, the insured expressly waives, in writing, the right to independent counsel.\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a7 2860, subd. (a).) Subdivision (b) of the statute further explains when such a conflict might arise. It provides: \u201cFor purposes of this section, a conflict of interest does not exist as to allegations or facts in the litigation for which the insurer denies coverage; however, when an insurer reserves its rights on a given issue and the outcome of that coverage issue can be controlled by counsel first retained by the insurer for the defense of the claim, a conflict of interest may exist. No conflict shall be deemed to exist as to allegations of punitive damages or be deemed to exist solely because an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1421\">*1421</page-number>insured is sued for an amount in excess of the insurance policy limits.\u201d Thus, under the express language of the statute, the fact punitive damages are alleged does not itself create a conflict, nor does a conflict exist solely because the insured is sued for an amount in excess of insurance policy limits. <em>(Blanchard, supra, </em>2 Cal.App.4th at p. 350, citing Civ. Code, \u00a7 2860 and <em>Foremost Ins. Co. v. Wilks </em>(1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 251, 261 [253 Cal.Rptr. 596].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-4\">But Civil Code section 2860 does not purport to address any and all conflicts that might arise: \u201cIt does not clearly state when the right to independent counsel vests.\u201d <em>(James 3 Corp. v. Truck Ins. Exchange, supra, </em>91 Cal.App.4th at p. 1101.) Civil Code section 2860, subdivision (b) is \u201can example of a conflict of interest which may require appointment of independent counsel. It is not, however, the only circumstance in which <em>Cumis </em>counsel may be required. The language of Civil Code section 2860 \u2018does not preclude judicial determination of conflict of interest and duty to provide independent counsel such as was accomplished in <em>Cumis </em>so long as that determination is consistent with the section.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Golden Eagle Ins. Co. v. Foremost Ins. Co. </em>(1993) 20 Cal.App.4th 1372, 1395-1396 [25 Cal.Rptr.2d 242].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-5\">Gafcon focuses on Travelers\u2019 reservation of rights to deny coverage and seek reimbursement for noncovered claims.  Consistent with section 2860, subdivision (b), courts of appeal, including ours, repeatedly recognize a conflict of interest does not arise every time the insurer proposes to provide a defense under a reservation of rights. There must also be evidence that \u201cthe outcome of [the] coverage issue can be controlled by counsel first retained by the insurer for the defense of the [underlying] claim.\u201d <em>(James 3 Corp. </em>v. <em>Truck Ins. Exchange, supra, </em>91 Cal.App.4th at p. 1102; see <em>Novak </em>v. <em>Low, Ball &amp; Lynch </em>(1999) 77 Cal.App.4th 278, 281 [91 Cal.Rptr.2d 453]; <em>Dynamic Concepts, Inc. </em>v. <em>Truck Insurance Exchange </em>(1998) 61 Cal.App.4th 999, 1006 [71 Cal.Rptr.2d 882]; <em>Truck Ins. Exchange v. Superior Court </em>(1996) 51 Cal.App.4th 985, 994 [59 Cal.Rptr.2d 529]; <em>Blanchard, supra, </em>2 Cal.App.4th at p. 350; <em>Golden Eagle Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Foremost Ins. Co., supra, </em>20 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1394-1395; <em>State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co. v. Superior Court </em>(1989) 216 Cal.App.3d 1222 [265 Cal.Rptr. 372]; <em>Native Sun Investment Group v. Ticor Title Ins. Co. </em>(1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 1265, 1277 [235 Cal.Rptr. 34].) In <em>State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co. v. Superior Court, </em>a panel of this court observed: <em>\u201cCumis </em>can be read to suggest that a conflict arises <em>whenever </em>the insurer asserts a reservation of its right to assert noncoverage, while still providing a defense to the liability action. [Citation.] This interpretation of <em>Cumis </em>would be erroneous, as pointed out in <em>McGee </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1985) 176 Cal.App.3d 221, 227 [221 Cal.Rptr. 421]. It is only when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1422\">*1422</page-number>the basis for the reservation of rights is such as to cause assertion of factual or legal theories which undermine or are contrary to the positions to be asserted in the liability case that a conflict of interest sufficient to require independent counsel, to be chosen by the insured, will arise.\u201d <em>(State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>at p. 1226, fn. 3; see also <em>Native Sun Investment Group v. Ticor Title Ins. Co., supra, </em>189 Cal.App.3d at p. 1277, quoting <em>McGee v. Superior Court, supra, </em>176 Cal.App.3d at p. 226 [the \u201c \u2018crucial fact\u2019 \u201d in <em>Cumis </em>was that the insurer\u2019s reservation of rights \u201c \u2018was based on the nature of the insured\u2019s conduct, which as developed at trial [of the third party claim] would affect the determination as to coverage\u2019 \u201d].) In the event of the insurer\u2019s reservation of rights, the insured\u2019s right to independent counsel \u201cdepends upon the nature of the coverage issue, as it relates to the issues in the underlying case.\u201d <em>(Blanchard, </em>at p. 350.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-4\">Under these authorities, there is no entitlement to independent counsel where the coverage issue is \u201c \u2018independent of, or extrinsic to, the issues in the underlying action [citations].\u2019 \u201d <em>(Gulf Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Berger, Kahn, Shafton, Moss, Figler, Simon &amp; Gladstone </em>(2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 114, 130-131 [93 Cal.Rptr.2d 534], citing <em>Dynamic Concepts, Inc. v. Truck Ins. Exchange, supra, </em>61 Cal.App.4th at p. 1006.) Stated otherwise, \u201cwhere the reservation of rights is based on coverage disputes which have nothing to do with the issues being litigated in the underlying action, there is no conflict of interest requiring independent \u2022 counsel.\u201d <em>(Foremost Ins. Co. v. Wilks, supra, </em>206 Cal.App.3d at p. 261.) Thus, in <em>Blanchard, </em>where homeowners sued a general contractor alleging various construction defects, and the insurer agreed to defend the contractor under a reservation of rights involving only potential noncoverage of certain damages, the Court of Appeal concluded there was no right to independent <em>Cumis </em>counsel as a matter of law. There, under the insured\u2019s policy, \u201c[t]he contractor [bore] the risk of repairing or replacing faulty workmanship, while the insurer [bore] the risk of damage to the property of others. [Citation.] If, for instance, faulty workmanship in the framing of dry wall led to rainwater leaking in and damaging a homeowner\u2019s furnishings, [the contractor] would be indemnified for the damage to the furnishings, but not for the cost of repairing or replacing the faulty workmanship. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Blanchard, supra, </em>2 Cal.App.4th at pp. 348-349.) The insured did not dispute this interpretation of the damages payable under the policy. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 349.) But more fatal to its appeal of the jury\u2019s verdict in the insurer\u2019s favor, it produced no evidence to show in what specific way the defense attorney could have controlled the outcome of the damage issue to appellant\u2019s detriment, or had incentive to do so. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 350.) It merely referred to \u201can unspecified <em>possibility of </em>a conflict.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>This was insufficient. Because \u201c[t]he coverage issue involved only damages\u201d and \u201c[Insurance counsel had no incentive to attach liability to appellant,\u201d the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1423\">*1423</page-number>concluded the attorneys hired by the insurer faced no conflict, and the trial court should have decided the <em>Cumis </em>issue as a matter of law. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1143-4\">Travelers\u2019 motion was based on evidence demonstrating that neither von Kaesborg nor any other Ponsor lawyer participated in the determination as to Travelers\u2019 reservation of rights, nor bore any responsibility for its coverage determination. Von Kaesborg further averred that Travelers did not interfere with his professional judgment and that he notified Gafcon that he \u201cwould not put any interests of Travelers above those of Gafcon.\u201d But whether or not counsel participated in the preliminary assessment of coverage is not the sole or determinative test for whether an attorney representing both insurer and insured operates under a conflict of interest. To meet its threshold summary judgment burden, Travelers was required to demonstrate that Gafcon was not entitled to the judicial declaration it sought\u2014that Gafcon could not establish Ponsor was able to control the outcome of coverage to Gafcon\u2019s detriment by positions it might take in litigation nor was Ponsor\u2019s representation rendered \u201cless effective\u201d by reason of its relationship with Travelers. (\u00a7 437c, subd. (o)(2); <em>see Aguilar, supra, 25 </em>Cal.4th at pp. 853-854.) Alternatively, Travelers could have demonstrated, by pointing to Gafcon\u2019s deficient discovery responses, that Gafcon did not possess and could not reasonably obtain needed evidence to show the existence of an actual conflict of interest. <em>(Aguilar, supra, </em>25 Cal.4th at pp. 853-854.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-5\">Although Travelers\u2019 evidence was directed at the more general question of whether Ponsor\u2019s representation of Gafcon was rendered less effective by Ponsor\u2019s status as staff counsel, it did not address Ponsor\u2019s ability to affect the question of coverage by its defense of the underlying action. It was not sufficient to show Ponsor &amp; Associates\u2019 lawyers were not influenced or controlled by Travelers and had no <em>intent </em>to affect the outcome of coverage. The statement in <em>Cumis </em>is still apt: \u201cNo matter how honest the intentions, counsel cannot discharge inconsistent duties.\u201d <em>(Cumis, supra, </em>162 Cal.App.3d at p. 366.) Travelers was required to show Ponsor &amp; Associates\u2019 lawyers <em>could not </em>impact coverage by the manner in which they defended the case. In order to meet its burden, Travelers was required to make some showing as to how the issues presented by Travelers\u2019 reservation of rights differed from or were extrinsic to those issues that were developing or had developed in the Association\u2019s action. The only evidence in the record on Travelers\u2019 motion, however, was the Association\u2019s complaint and Travelers\u2019 policy exclusion for damages based upon errors or deficiencies in advice or consultation given by Gafcon. Travelers failed to establish, by attorney declaration or other admissible evidence, that the Association\u2019s claims against Gafcon were not based upon conduct by Gafcon that would impact the ultimate coverage determination. Absent such a showing, Travelers did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1424\">*1424</page-number>not carry its burden on summary judgment to show Gafcon could not establish a conflict of interest requiring the retention of <em>Cumis </em>counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-4\">Given our conclusion that the court erred in granting summary judgment on Gafcon\u2019s fourth cause of action for declaratory relief, we need not address Gafcon\u2019s claim with respect to the trial court\u2019s refusal to take judicial notice of the unpublished decision of Division Three of the Court of Appeal, Second Appellate District in <em>Pacific Greystone Corp. </em>v. <em>Aetna Insurance Co. </em>(Apr. 26, 2000, B124297).</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-5\">D. <em>Unfair Competition Cause of Action</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1144-6\">Gafcon contends the court erred in granting summary judgment on its sixth cause of action under the unfair competition law (UCL) (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 17200 et seq.). It asserts Travelers failed to address that cause of action in its motion and the court did not address it in its order. The contention is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-7\">Contrary to Gafcon\u2019s assertions, Travelers indeed sought an adjudication of Gafcon\u2019s sixth cause of action by including it in its separate statement of undisputed facts. Moreover, as Travelers points out, Gafcon\u2019s unfair business practices cause of action was not based on the theory that Travelers \u201coverstate[s] its cost of defense when it reports the amount it assesses its insureds (rather than the actual cost) to the Department of Insurance. . . .\u201d Although Gafcon argued in opposition to Travelers\u2019 motion that Travelers \u201cmay\u201d be obtaining its rate approval from insurance regulators based upon false expense information and overstates these costs, no such allegations appear in its second amended complaint. Travelers was not bound to address unpleaded issues in its motion for summary judgment. <em>(Bostrom v.

While Gafcon argues the trial court should not have limited the scope of summary judgment based on perceived deficiency in the pleadings, it does not point out where in the record it requested leave to amend its .pleading. Absent such a request, we do not fault the trial court for limiting its ruling to those theories presently alleged in Gafcon\u2019s second amended complaint. <em>(Bostrom v. County of San </em>Bernardino, at p. 1664.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-8\">For the first time in its reply brief, Gafcon points out its unfair competition cause of action is based upon allegations that \u201cinsurance companies profit directly and indirectly by using employee attorneys to represent their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1425\">*1425</page-number>insured, which is illegal, unethical, [and] violates the California Rules of Professional Conduct and the State Bar Act . . . .\u201d  Presuming Gafcon\u2019s allegations as to unethical or illegal profits sufficiently stated an unfair or illegal practice under the broad scope of the UCL (see <em>Cel-Tech Communications, Inc. </em>v. <em>Los Angeles Cellular Telephone Co. </em>(1999) 20 Cal.4th 163, 181 [83 Cal.Rptr.2d 548, 973 P.2d 527]),<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Travelers\u2019 threshold summary judgment burden was to demonstrate Gafcon could not establish one or more elements of such a cause of action based upon those allegations. (\u00a7 437c, subd. (o)(2).)  Travelers could negate Gafcon\u2019s claim of an unfair or illegal profit in at least two ways: it could either (1) present admissible evidence demonstrating it did not obtain any profit derived from its use of employee attorneys such as Ponsor, thus eliminating the court\u2019s need to determine whether such profit was illegal or unfair; or (2) present argument that, assuming it derived a profit from its use of employed counsel to represent its insureds, such a profit is not illegal or unfair within the meaning of the UCL as a matter of law. (See <em>Aguilar, supra, </em>25 Cal.4th at pp. 853-854.) Travelers could have also demonstrated through admissible evidence that Gafcon did not possess, and could not reasonably obtain, needed evidence in support of its cause of action. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 853-854, 855.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-4\">In its moving papers, Travelers asserted it had complied with its obligations under the Civil Code with respect to independent <em>Cumis </em>counsel, and had not engaged in any unlawful, unfair, or fraudulent business act or practice, or deceptive, untrue or misleading advertising. It identified the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1426\">*1426</page-number>same evidence demonstrating its lack of control or interference in Ponsor\u2019s defense, including the statement in von Kaesborg\u2019s declaration averring, \u201cAt no time do we split fees with Travelers.\u201d Such evidence was by itself insufficient to negate any possible unfair competition claim based upon Travelers\u2019 profit. However, in reply to Gafcon\u2019s opposition papers, Travelers presented an additional declaration by DiVirglio, Travelers\u2019 deputy general counsel, in which he averred: \u201cTravelers makes no profit from its use of staff counsel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1146-4\">DiVirglio\u2019s declaration, while terse, was sufficient to meet Travelers\u2019 threshold summary judgment burden. At no time during arguments on the matter did Gafcon object to the foundation or competency of this particular evidence, nor did it object to the inclusion of this new evidence included in Travelers\u2019 reply papers. Absent any objection to the inclusion of new evidence in Travelers\u2019 reply brief, the court was entitled to consider the evidence as within the record before it. <em>(Plenger v. Alza Corp. </em>(1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 349, 362, fn. 8 [13 Cal.Rptr.2d 811]; <em>Coy v. County of Los Angeles </em>(1991) 235 Cal.App.3d 1077, 1084 [1 Cal.Rptr.2d 215].) On appeal, Gafcon has not disputed the accuracy of that statement, nor has it presented evidence raising an inference to contradict it. In view of Gafcon\u2019s failure to challenge this particular evidence either before the trial court or before us on appeal, we conclude the court properly granted summary judgment on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1146-5\">IV. <em>Request for Additional Discovery</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1146-6\">Gafcon challenges the trial court\u2019s denial of its motions to compel discovery on matters it contends were necessary to establish certain facts, including the existence of restrictions Travelers imposed upon its staff counsel and Travelers\u2019 reporting of false and misleading information to the Department of Insurance. We do not address this contention. For Gafcon to properly challenge the court\u2019s discovery rulings as an abuse of discretion, it must provide this court, at a minimum, with a record and argument as to the scope of discovery it sought, its relevance to the issues in the underlying lawsuit, and the basis for the trial court\u2019s ruling. Absent such matters before us, the record is simply inadequate to assess whether the court\u2019s rulings on discovery were an abuse of discretion or reach any other conclusion on the propriety of the trial court\u2019s decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1146-7\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b1146-8\">The judgment with respect to Ponsor &amp; Associates and von Kaesborg is affirmed.

In its opposition, Gafcon asked the court to liberally construe the allegations of its second amended complaint as also including Ponsor as a defendant in its sixth cause of action for injunctive relief (despite its being expressly labeled as against only the insurer defendants), and sought leave to amend in the event the court felt its pleading did not adequately apprise Ponsor of the claims asserted against it. Even if we were to construe that cause of action as against Ponsor, it would not change our conclusion here. Ordinarily, injunctive relief is available to prevent threatened injury and is not a remedy designed to right completed wrongs. <em>(Gold v. Los Angeles Democratic League </em>(1975) 49 Cal.App.3d 365, 372 [122 Cal.Rptr. 732], limited on other grounds in <em>Youst v.

Indeed, a change in circumstances at the time of the hearing, rendering injunctive relief moot or unnecessary, justifies denial of the request.\u201d <em>(Scripps Health v. Marin, </em>at p. 332.) Unless there is a showing that the challenged action is being continued or repeated, an injunction should be denied. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 333; see also <em>Paul v. Milk Depots, Inc. </em>(1964) 62 Cal.2d 129, 132-133 [41 Cal.Rptr. 468, 396 P.2d 924].) Whether the issue presented by Gafcon\u2019s complaint will ever arise again vis-a-vis Gafcon and Ponsor is highly speculative. Under these circumstances, the court should not intervene to exercise its injunctive powers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1124-7\"> See Mallen, <em>Defense by Salaried Counsel: A Bane or a Blessing? </em>(1994) 61 Def.Couns.J. 518; and generally <em>General Dynamics </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1994) 7 Cal.4th 1164, 1171 &amp; fn. 2 [32 Cal.Rptr.2d 1, 876 P.2d 487].)

[Citation.] Since the Act\u2019s passage, the general rule has been that, although persons may represent themselves and their own interests regardless of State Bar membership, no one but an active member of the State Bar may practice law for another person in California.

As indicated, the rationale behind this doctrine is to protect the public from incompetent or unskilled nonlawyers. Gafcon does not claim that any lawyer acting on its behalf was not licensed to practice law in California. Moreover, as we explain <em>post, </em>it has not shown any Travelers nonattomey employee sought to control Gafcon\u2019s defense of the Association\u2019s action in any way.

Second is the assumption that outside attorneys are independent. Third is the assumption that outside attorneys are not profit-motivated.

The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1414\">*1414</page-number>Indiana high court pointed out that eight of 10 state courts addressing the issue and one federal circuit have concluded it is permissible for an attorney employed by an insurance company to represent the company\u2019s insureds, and two states <em>(American Ins.

In <em>Gardner, </em>for example, the court held that the acts of the employed attorneys were in fact the acts of Nationwide Insurance Company and therefore in violation of its statutory prohibition against the practice of law by a corporation as contained in General Statutes of North Carolina sections 84-2.1 and 84-5 (1985). Those statutes defined the practice of law as \u201c \u2018performing any legal service for any other person, firm or corporation, with or without compensation. . . .\u2019 \u201d and stated \u201c \u2018[i]t shall be unlawful for any corporation to practice law or appear as an attorney for any person in any court in this State. . . .\u2019\u201d <em>(Gardner, supra, </em>341 S.E.2d at p. 520.)
