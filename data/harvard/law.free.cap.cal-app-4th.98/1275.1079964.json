J.</author>\n<p id=\"AVx\">Donald Bruce Crawford sued the Huntington Beach Union High School District and the California Department of Education (collectively the District unless the context indicates otherwise), contending the racial and ethnic balancing component of the District\u2019s open-transfer policy violates Proposition 209 (Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 31). He appeals the judgment entered after the trial court denied his motion for summary judgment and granted the District\u2019s. We agree with his contention on appeal\u2014that the policy violates Proposition 209. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-8\">\n<em>The Transfer Policy</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-9\">The District has an open transfer policy for all its high schools. The open-transfer policy has a \u201cracial and ethnic balance\u201d component as required by section 35160.5 of the state Education Code. This statute dictates that \u201cschool districts shall retain the authority to maintain appropriate racial and ethnic balances among their respective schools at the school districts\u2019 discretion or as specified in applicable court-ordered or voluntary desegregation plans.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1029-10\">There are six high schools in the District, but the only high school affected by the one-for-one same race exchange policy, that is, has been declared \u201cethnically isolated,\u201d is Westminster High School. The District has employed a private firm, Davis Demographics, to do demographic studies for it. This private firm uses, in the language of the firm\u2019s owner, Gregory Davis, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1278\">*1278</page-number>in a declaration in the record, \u201cDistrict data from student records of names, addresses, schools of attendance, and ethnicity,\u201d which has been \u201cstored in a computer program which can be utilized to generate statistical information based on race relative to each high school and its established geographic attendance area.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-4\">The actual tables supplied by Davis Demographics for Westminster High School put every student into one of the following categories: (1) \u201cAmerican Indian or Alaska Native\u201d; (2) the Asian sub-categories of (a) \u201cJapanese,\u201d (b) \u201cKorean,\u201d (c) \u201cChinese,\u201d (d) \u201cVietnamese,\u201d (e) \u201cLaotian\u201d and (f) \u201cOther Asian\u201d; (3) \u201cHawaiian/Pacific Islander\u201d; (4) \u201cFilipino\u201d; (5) \u201cMexican American Chicano Span. Sum.\u201d ; (6) \u201cBlack Negroid Afro-American\u201d; and (7) \u201cTotal White Students.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1030-5\">To prevent an \u201cinappropriate\u201d racial and ethnic balance, the District restricts transfers to and from Westminster High School. If you are White and you live inside the high school\u2019s attendance area, you cannot transfer out unless another White student is willing to transfer in and take your place. If you are non-White and you live outside the high school\u2019s attendance area, you cannot transfer in unless another non-White student is willing to transfer out and you take that student\u2019s place.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-6\">Demographic studies calculated that, for the 1999-2000 academic year, the school\u2019s makeup was roughly four-tenths Vietnamese (41.1 percent, total Asian is 45.2 percent), three-tenths \u201cMexican American Chicano Spanish Surname\u201d (30.5 percent), and one-sixth \u201cWhite\u201d (15.9 percent).</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-7\">Crawford, a taxpayer in the District, brought this action in September 1999 to challenge the constitutionality of the one-for-one same race exchange policy under Proposition 209. Crawford and the District both brought motions for summary judgment. The District\u2019s motion largely relied on several pre-Proposition 209 cases decided under the <em>state </em>equal protection clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-8\">In mid-December 2000, the trial court granted the District\u2019s motion and denied Crawford\u2019s. In a brief minute order, it ruled that the District\u2019s transfer policy was not prohibited under Proposition 209 and \u201cpromotes a non-segregated public education.\u201d The formal order granting the District\u2019s motion stated that the court had considered the Supreme Court\u2019s recent opinion in <em>Hi-Voltage Wire Works, Inc. v. City of San Jose </em>(2000) 24 Cal.4th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1279\">*1279</page-number>537 [101 Cal.Rptr.2d 653, 12 P.3d 1068] <em>(Hi-Voltage) </em>and that the case \u201chad no application\u201d to the \u201cpending dispute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-5\">H</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-6\">\n<em>California Law</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-7\">Crawford contends the trial court erred in granting the District\u2019s summary judgment motion. He contends the racial balancing component of the District\u2019s open enrollment program violates Proposition 209. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-8\">The voters adopted Proposition 209 in the November 1996 General Election. The initiative measure added section 31 to article I of the California Constitution, which states in relevant part: \u201c(a) The State shall not discriminate against, or grant preferential treatment to, any individual or group on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin in the operation of public employment, public education, or public contracting.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-9\">In <em>Hi-Voltage, supra, </em>24 Cal.4th 537, the California Supreme Court applied a common and plain meaning approach to the words \u201cdiscriminate against, or grant preferential treatment to\u201d as used in Proposition 209. As of this writing, the only other published decision to substantively consider a challenge to a government program under Proposition 209 is <em>Connerly v. State Personnel Bd. </em>(2001) 92 Cal.App.4th 16 [112 Cal.Rptr.2d 5] <em>(Connerly). Connerly </em>involved challenges to several state government affirmative action programs, all of which were held to contravene Proposition 209.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-10\">In <em>Hi-Voltage, </em>all seven members of our state\u2019s high court held that San Jose\u2019s contractor outreach program on behalf of \u201cwomen and minority business enterprises\u201d was unconstitutional under article I, section 31 of the state Constitution. <em>(Hi-Voltage, supra, </em>24 Cal.4th at p. 562 [\u201cwe remain persuaded the City\u2019s Program violates section 31\u201d]; <em>id. </em>at p. 572 (conc. opn. of Mosk, J.) [\u201cdespite the legitimacy and even necessity of its end, the means that the city\u2019s program employs offend section 31\u201d]; <em>id. </em>at p. 575 (conc. opn. of Kennard, J.) [applying \u201ccommon meaning of \u2018preferential,\u2019 I agree . . . that the challenged program of the City of San Jose grants preferential treatment on the basis of race and sex in the operation of public contracting\u201d]; <em>id. </em>at p. 596 (conc. &amp; dis. opn. of George, C. J.) [\u201cwe must conclude that an outreach program directed to an audience on the basis of its members\u2019 race or gender constitutes a program that grants preferential treatment for purposes of article I, section 31\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-11\">The program considered by the high court in <em>Hi-Voltage </em>gave prospective bidders on city contracts a choice. They could, <em>but were not required, </em>to use <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1280\">*1280</page-number>a certain percentage of subcontractors who were women or members of ethnic minorities. Alternatively, they merely had to document their efforts to reach out to \u201cwomen and minority business enterprises\u201d to give them the opportunity to obtain a subcontract on the program. That meant simply giving notice to at least four businesses owned by women or members of a minority ethnic group. The teeth in the second choice was that if a prospective bidder rejected a low bid from a subcontractor owned by a woman or a member of a minority ethnic group, he had to give written reasons for the rejection. <em>(Hi-Voltage, supra, </em>24 Cal.4th at p. 542.) The program had been prompted by a study that had shown \u201ca historical pattern of discrimination by prime contractors against minority-owned and women-owned subcontractors . . . with regard to public contracts awarded by the city.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 588 (conc. &amp; dis. opn. of George, C. J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-4\">In <em>Hi-Voltage, </em>the city argued that its outreach program did not involve any \u201covert discrimination.\u201d <em>(Hi-Voltage, supra, </em>24 Cal.4th at p. 560, fn. 13.) The procedures were merely a device to \u201cscreen\u201d for discrimination. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 544.) The city claimed that, operationally, the program merely expanded the pool of candidates to obtain subcontract jobs, but did \u201cnot afford preferential treatment on the basis of race or gender in the actual selection process itself.\u201d (See <em>id. </em>at p. 593 (conc. &amp; dis. opn. of George, C. J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-5\">Even so, the court determined that the program contravened Proposition 209. The key constitutional language of the provision is in the words \u201cdiscriminate against or grant preferential treatment to.\u201d The court looked to the ordinary plain meaning of the key words. \u201cDiscriminate\u201d means \u201cdistinctions in treatment.\u201d A \u201cpreference\u201d means the \u201c \u2018giving of priority or advantage to one person . . . over others.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Hi-Voltage, supra, </em>24 Cal.4th at pp. 559-560; see also <em>id. </em>at p. 575 (conc. opn. of Kennard, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-6\">Using the plain ordinary meaning of the words \u201cdiscriminate\u201d and \u201cpreference,\u201d it was clear that, while the city\u2019s outreach program might not have involved, as the city claimed, any \u201covert\u201d discrimination, it was still discriminatory and preferential. The program required prospective bidders to give \u201c \u2018personal attention\u2019 \u201d to potential subcontractors owned by women and members of minority ethnic' groups that was not required to be given to other businesses. <em>(Hi-Voltage, supra, </em>24 Cal.4th at p. 544; see also <em>id. </em>at p. 590 (cone. &amp; dis. opn. of George, C. J.) [agreeing that documentation component granted preferential treatment within the meaning of Prop. 209].) Requiring prospective bidders to give \u201cspecial assistance and information\u201d based on race or sex was enough to contravene Proposition 209. <em>(Hi-Voltage, </em>at p. 544.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1281\">*1281</page-number>Moreover, as the Chief Justice pointed out, the program was also discriminatory in the <em>incentives </em>that it created. A prime contractor was given a \u201cstrong incentive\u201d to grant preferential treatment to at least some prospective subcontractors owned by women or members of minority ethnic groups because it would allow the prime contractor to avoid the burdensome documentation requirements and to look good for future contracts. (See <em>Hi-Voltage, supra, </em>24 Cal.4th at p. 592 (conc. &amp; dis. opn. of George, C. J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-5\">While the court made it clear that preferential treatment based on race or gender was impermissible in light of Proposition 209, it acknowledged its holding was \u201cnecessarily limited to the form at issue here, which requires contractors to notify, solicit, and negotiate with [minority or female owned] subcontractors as well as justify rejection of their bids.\u201d <em>(Hi-Voltage, supra, </em>24 Cal.4th at p. 565.) The court expressed \u201cno opinion regarding the permissible parameters\u201d of outreach efforts that would not offend Proposition 209. <em>(Hi-Voltage, </em>at p. 565.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-6\">In <em>Connerly, supra, 92 </em>Cal.App.4th 16 the appellate court reviewed five state government affirmative action programs. The court concluded Proposition 209 prevented the state from awarding public contracts, civil service positions, and employment promotions to \u201cfavored groups\u201d on the basis of race or gender. <em>(Connerly, supra, 92 </em>Cal.App.4th at pp. 47-63.) Although the court severed and upheld certain elements of the challenged programs, most notably data collection and reporting requirements, it reiterated the core idea that \u201cracial classification is presumptively invalid, and the burden is on the government to demonstrate extraordinary justification. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 36.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-7\">The first of the programs under review in <em>Connerly </em>was a subcontracting program under the auspices of the state lottery requiring bidders for business with the state lottery commission to include specific plans \u201cto utilize subcontracts with socially and economically disadvantaged small business concerns.\u201d Race, ethnic and gender classifications were incorporated into the meaning of the phrase, \u201csocially and economically disadvantaged.\u201d (See <em>Connerly, supra, 92 </em>Cal.App.4th at pp. 47-48.) In theory White males could be included as persons who were \u201csocially and economically disadvantaged\u201d as well, but there were \u201cno definitional criteria, no application procedures, and no procedures for review.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 48.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-8\">The court held the program unconstitutional, because of the operational <em>presumption </em>of disadvantage. \u201cEven if such procedures [allowing White males to apply] were included in statute, the fact that some individuals must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1282\">*1282</page-number><em>prove </em>disadvantage while others are <em>conclusively presumed </em>to be disadvantaged based solely on race, ethnicity, and gender, established impermissible race, ethnicity, and gender classifications.\u201d <em>(Connerly, supra, </em>92 Cal.App.4th at p. 48, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-4\">The next program reviewed by the <em>Connerly </em>court involved state contracts for professional bond services (essentially the folks who help the state sell its bonds to investors). The program operated much the same way as San Jose\u2019s government contract program did. If there was a bond service available without competitive bidding, the respective government department was required, at a minimum, to give notice to all women and minority enterprises who had listed their names with the awarding department. In short, they got \u201cspecial notice of the sale.\u201d (See <em>Connerly, supra, </em>92 Cal.App.4th at p. 51.) And because they got <em>special </em>notice, the <em>Connerly </em>court held that the program contravened Proposition 209 because it involved the \u201cselective dissemination of information\u201d <em>(Connerly, </em>at p. 51.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-5\">The third program held unconstitutional in <em>Connerly </em>involved the state civil service generally. A general statute made each governmental agency \u201c \u2018responsible for establishing an effective affirmative action program.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Connerly, supra, </em>92 Cal.App.4th at p. 53.) Each agency was supposed to establish \u201cgoals and timetables to overcome identified underutilization of minorities and women.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 55.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-6\">The court held that the duty imposed on \u201cevery managerial employee, from first line supervisors on up, to attempt to achieve the agency or departmental goals\u201d of eliminating the \u201cunderutilization\u201d was both violative of both Proposition 209 <em>and </em>equal protection. <em>(Connerly, supra, </em>92 Cal.App.4th at p. 55.) It differed from a quota or set-aside \u201conly in degree.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>It was still a \u201cline drawn on the basis of race and gender.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1034-7\">Next, <em>Connerly </em>considered an affirmative action program for the state community college system. Each community college district was required to have a plan which ensured \u201cthat district personnel participate in, and are committed to, the affirmative action employment program.\u201d <em>(Connerly, supra, </em>92 Cal.App.4th at p. 58, citing Ed. Code \u00a7 87102, subd. (a).) The plan included \u201chiring goals and timetables for its implementation\u201d with the \u201cgoal\u201d that by the year 2005 the community college system \u201cwork force will reflect proportionately the adult population of the state.\u201d <em>(Connerly, </em>at p. 59.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-8\">The court held that having \u201coverall and continuing hiring goal[s]\u201d of making a given workforce \u201cproportionately reflect the adult population of the state\u201d was a violation of Proposition 209. <em>(Connerly, supra, </em>92 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1283\">*1283</page-number>Cal.App.4th at p. 59.) The \u201cgoal of assuring participation by some specified percentage of a particular group merely because of its race or gender is \u2018discrimination for its own sake\u2019 \u201d and contravened both Proposition 209 and the state\u2019s equal protection clause. <em>(Connerly, supra, </em>at pp. 59-61.) The program was not a mere \u201cinclusive outreach\u201d effort because it utilized the suspect classifications of race, gender and ethnicity. Some groups were \u201cfavored\u201d over others, because application processes were structured so that sufficient numbers of that group would end up being hired. (See <em>id. </em>at p. 61.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-5\">While the <em>Connerly </em>court allowed mere data collection and reporting aspects of all the other programs to be severed from those programs and held constitutional, the reporting requirements in the community college program were \u201centirely bound up and intermixed with the success of the preferential hiring scheme\u201d so that they could not be severed. Hence the community college reporting requirements were held to be unconstitutional. <em>(Connerly, supra, </em>92 Cal.App.4th at p. 61.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-6\">Finally, the <em>Connerly </em>court considered one last <em>reporting </em>requirement, this one in connection with \u201cparticipation goals\u201d for state contracts. <em>(Connerly, supra, </em>92 Cal.App.4th at p. 62.) Unlike the reporting requirement for the community colleges, this data collection program could be severed from otherwise discriminatory <em>participation </em>goals. The reason was that it went to the Legislature\u2019s \u201cpower of inquiry.\u201d (See <em>Connerly, supra, </em>92 Cal.App.4th at pp. 62-63.) The fact that data is \u201ccollected and reported\u201d to the Legislature could only be of use to that body for <em>future </em>consideration, it is not a \u201csupervisorial device\u201d necessarily intertwined with a discriminatory program. (I<em>d. </em>at p. 63.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-7\">m</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-8\">\n<em>Our Case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-9\">The District insists <em>Hi-Voltage </em>and <em>Connerly </em>are inapplicable to the facts before us. It argues its policy is not analogous to the outreach programs addressed in those cases and characterizes the transfer policy as a permissible <em>voluntary desegregation program </em>that neither discriminates nor grants preferential treatment based on race. The District asserts that because \u201ceach school has the same general educational program and provides the same educational opportunities,\u201d there is no evidence that some students are \u201cdisadvantaged\u201d by or \u201cbenefit\u201d from the race-conscious transfer policy. (Page 31 of the District\u2019s brief.) The District further maintains the policy is simply a race-conscious program that seeks to provide students with equal educational opportunities. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1284\">*1284</page-number>Under the policy, White student open enrollment transfers out of the school and non-White student transfers into the school are limited to a one-for-one basis. The imposition of these restrictions is inconsistent with the freedom of choice that voluntary programs provide. And more importantly, the policy creates different transfer criteria for students solely on the basis of their race. A White student may not transfer from Westminster High School to a different school until a White student chooses to transfer in and fills the void. A non-White student must wait to transfer into Westminster High School until a non-White student transfers out thereby creating essentially a \u201cnon-White opening.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-4\">Referencing its history, the District asserts Proposition 209 was never intended to eliminate school integration programs. Yet, by its terms, article I, section 31 of the state Constitution, applies to public education. Subdivision (a) of section 31 plainly says that \u201cThe State shall not discriminate against, or grant preferential treatment to, any individual or group on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin in the operation of . . . public education . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-5\">The ballot materials concerning Proposition 209 were quite clear that even race-conscious \u201cdesegregation\u201d programs could be affected by Proposition 209. The Legislative Analyst prepared an in-depth analysis. That analysis, as Chief Justice George put it, is precisely \u201cthe item in the ballot pamphlet materials that voters are most likely to have . . . consulted as a reliable indicator of the proposition\u2019s meaning and effect.\u201d <em>(Hi-Voltage, supra, </em>24 Cal.4th at p. 582 (con. &amp; dis. opn. of George, C. J.).) And that analysis had told the voters that \u201c \u2018the measure could eliminate, or cause fundamental changes to, voluntary desegregation programs run by school districts.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 584 (conc. &amp; dis. opn. of George, C. J.).) The Legislative Analyst specifically noted that Proposition 209 could affect special funding for \u201c \u2018designated \u201cracially isolated minority schools\u201d that are located in areas with high proportions of racial or ethnic minorities.\u201d <em>(Hi-Voltage, </em>at p. 584 (conc. &amp; dis. opn. of George, C. J.), quoting the Ballot Pamp., Gen. Elect. (Nov. 5, 1996) Legis. Analyst\u2019s analysis of Prop. 209, at p. 31.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-6\">The District emphasizes the special nature of K-12 public education and we do not underestimate the significance of quality K-12 public education. But while we appreciate the unique value and importance of education (see, e.g., <em>Brown v. Board of Education </em>(1954) 347 U.S. 483, 493 [74 S.Ct. 686, 691, 98 L.Ed. 873, 38 A.L.R.2d 1180] [\u201ceducation is perhaps the most important function of state and local governments\u201d]), it is clear the intention of the voters was that Proposition 209 apply to education. The district\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1285\">*1285</page-number>transfer policy violates Proposition 209, and to the extent it is required by Education Code section 35160.5, the statute does as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-6\">\n<em>Equal Protection Considerations</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-7\">The District proposes that the transfer policy is required under the equal protection clause of the Constitution of the United States. While there can be no question the United States Constitution prohibits a school district from acting to segregate schools, there is no federal constitutional mandate necessitating the implementation of a proactive program of integration. The United States Supreme Court has made it clear that such a plan is <em>not required </em>by the federal equal protection clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-8\">\u201cRacial isolation\u201d or \u201cimbalance\u201d that is not the result of segregative intent does not require a racially discriminatory \u201cdesegregation\u201d plan. <em>(Dayton Board of Education </em>v. <em>Brinkman </em>(1977) 433 U.S. 406, 413 [97 S.Ct. 2766, 2772, 53 L.Ed.2d 851] [\u201cThe finding that the pupil population in the various Dayton schools is not homogeneous, standing by itself, is not a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment in the absence of a showing that this condition resulted from intentionally segregative actions on the part of the Board.\u201d]; <em>Milliken </em>v. <em>Bradley </em>(1977) 433 U.S. 267, 280, fn. 14 [97 S.Ct. 2749, 2757, 53 L.Ed.2d 745] [no federal constitutional right to a \u201cparticular degree of racial balance or mixing\u201d]; <em>Swann v. Board of Education </em>(1971) 402 U.S. 1, 26 [91 S.Ct. 1267, 1281, 28 L.Ed.2d 554] [racial imbalances may result from innocent causes such as the population distribution of a given district]; accord, <em>Missouri v. Jenkins </em>(1995) 515 U.S. 70 [115 S.Ct. 2038, 132 L.Ed.2d 63] [federal court had no authority to order the state to fund predominantly non-White school district so as to attract White students from surrounding districts, so that the non-White district would be better balanced].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-9\">The distinction between what is required by the federal equal protection clause, and what may be permitted by it, is critical in this context. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals recognized in the absence of de jure segregation there is no constitutionally required obligation to order desegregation. \u201cRacial balancing cannot be the objective of a federal court unless the balancing is shown to be necessary to correct the effects of government action of a racist character.\u201d <em>(Ho by Ho </em>v. <em>San Francisco Unified School Dist. </em>(9th Cir. 1998) 147 F.3d 854, 865, citing <em>Freeman v. Pitts </em>(1992) 503 U.S. 467, 474 [112 S.Ct. 1430, 1437, 118 L.Ed.2d 108].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-10\">With respect to the equal protection provisions of the California Constitution, the District relies, in part, on statements from <em>Crawford v. Board of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1286\">*1286</page-number><em>Education </em>(1976) 17 Cal.3d 280 [130 Cal.Rptr. 724, 551 P.2d 28]; <em>Serrano v. Priest </em>(1971) 5 Cal.3d 584 [96 Cal.Rptr. 601, 487 P.2d 1241, 41 A.L.R.3d 1187], <em>San Francisco Unified School Dist. v. Johnson </em>(1971) 3 Cal.3d 937 [92 Cal.Rptr. 309, 479 P.2d 669]; and <em>Jackson v. Pasadena City School Dist. </em>(1963) 59 Cal.2d 876 [31 Cal.Rptr. 606, 382 P.2d 878] and other preProposition 209 California cases. But Proposition 209 has undeniably changed the state law.  It is a firmly established rule of constitutional jurisprudence that where two constitutional provisions conflict, the one that was enacted later in time controls. <em>(People v. Adamson </em>(1946) 27 Cal.2d 478, 486-487 [165 P.2d 3] [1934 constitutional amendment qualified previous inability to comment on defendant\u2019s failure to take stand]; <em>Slavich v. Walsh </em>(1947) 82 Cal.App.2d 228, 236-237 [186 P.2d 35] [resolving conflict in power of chartered cities under one constitutional provision by looking to other constitutional provisions enacted later in time].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-4\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-5\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-6\">One can reasonably infer that in enacting Education Code section 35160.5, the California Legislature believed that unrestricted open transfer policies might result in what the literature calls de facto segregation, or at least racial or ethnic imbalance. Yet, despite the presumed legitimacy of the Legislature\u2019s motives, we are forced to conclude that the balancing component of Education Code section 35160.5 is in contravention of the state constitution as amended by Proposition 209.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-7\">It is not our intention to suggest that there cannot be any \u201cintegration plans\u201d under Proposition 209. We stress that an \u201cintegration plan\u201d developed by a school board need not offend Proposition 209 if it does not discriminate or grant preferences on the basis of race or ethnicity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-8\">Although our analysis is limited to the facts before us and we answer only the questions presented to us in this appeal, we note other courts have confronted similar issues in different factual contexts and rendered opinions. The benefits of the development of magnet schools has been cited by some courts. \u201cMagnet schools have the advantage of encouraging voluntary movement of students within a school district in a pattern that aids desegregation on a voluntary basis . . . .\u201d <em>(Missouri v. Jenkins, supra, </em>515 U.S. 70, 92 [115 S.Ct. 2038, 2051].) Another version of an \u201cintegration plan\u201d described is a program which would assign only a very small geographic area for a student\u2019s home school, and fill remaining places in that school\u2019s class by an unweighted random lottery. (See <em>Tuttle v. Arlington County School Bd. </em>(4th Cir. 1999) 195 F.3d 698, 706.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1287\">*1287</page-number>We do not dispute the evils of segregated schools and we recognize the potential benefits of attending a racially and ethnically diverse school, but the people have spoken. California Constitution, article I, section 31 is clear in its prohibition against discrimination or preferential treatment based on race, sex, color, ethnicity or national origin. Thus, the racial balancing component of the District\u2019s open transfer policy is invalid under our state Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-5\">The judgment is reversed. The trial court is directed to enter a new order denying the District\u2019s motion for summary judgment and granting Crawford\u2019s motion for summary judgment and to enter a new judgment accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-6\">Crawford shall recover his costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-7\">Rylaarsdam, J., and O\u2019Leary, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-8\">Respondents\u2019 petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied August 28, 2002.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1029-11\"> Education Code section 35160.5 provides in pertinent part: \u201c[T]he governing board of each school district shall, as a condition for the receipt of school apportionments from the state school fund, adopt rules and regulations establishing a policy of open enrollment within the district for residents of the district. . . .
