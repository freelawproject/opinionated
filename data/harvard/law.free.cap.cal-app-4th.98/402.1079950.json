(All further undesignated statutory references are to the Penal Code.) On appeal, defendant claims there was no evidence he acted with the \u201clewd\u201d intent required to support his conviction. Because even defendant agrees the evidence was sufficient to support a finding he exposed his genitals to the other driver to annoy or offend her, we conclude the evidence was sufficient to support his conviction. Accordingly, we will affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-12\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b341-13\">In May 2000, the victim was driving her vehicle on Watt Avenue in Sacramento. Traffic was heavy because of construction and cars were required to merge into one lane. The victim noticed defendant driving his truck behind her. Defendant was swerving back and forth, tailgating, waving his hands and \u201cflipping [her] off.\u201d As defendant got close to the victim, she leaned out her window and yelled, \u201cI hope you have insurance for when you hit me.\u201d Defendant replied by calling her a couple of obscene names, and she \u201cflipped him off.\u201d Defendant got very close to her vehicle, backed off, then repeated this behavior. He appeared to be very angry and the victim became nervous.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>When the construction zone ended, three lanes were open. The victim got in the far left lane and defendant drove in the middle lane, yelling at her. They stopped at an intersection and defendant continued to yell at her. When she looked over at him, defendant lifted the lower part of his body, exposed his penis to her and yelled at her to \u201csuck [my] dick.\u201d Defendant then put his truck into reverse, positioned it behind her vehicle, and started bumping the back of her vehicle with his.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">When the light turned green, defendant pulled in front of the victim. She wrote his license plate number down on her hand. As they proceeded up the road, defendant again moved to the lane next to her. At the next intersection, defendant pulled out a black handgun and pointed it at her, yelling \u201cI hope you have life insurance for when I shoot you.\u201d The frightened victim ran the red light and drove directly to a nearby sheriff\u2019s substation. Defendant made a U-tum and drove off.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">Defendant was convicted by a jury of one count of unlawfully exhibiting a firearm (\u00a7 417.3), two counts of being a convicted felon in possession of a firearm (\u00a7 12021, subd. (a)), and one count of indecent exposure (\u00a7 314, subd. 1). On appeal, defendant challenges only his indecent exposure conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">Section 314 provides in pertinent part: \u201cEvery person who willfully and lewdly . . . HQ 1. Exposes his person, or the private parts thereof, in any public place, or in any place where there are present other persons to be offended or annoyed thereby . . . HD . . .is guilty of a misdemeanor.\u201d \u201cThe separate requirement that the intent of the actor be \u2018lewd\u2019 is an essential element of the offense . . . .\u201d <em>(In re Smith </em>(1972) 7 Cal.3d 362, 365 [102 Cal.Rptr. 335, 497 P.2d 807] <em>(Smith).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b342-8\">Defendant contends there is insufficient evidence to support his indecent exposure conviction because there was no evidence of \u201clewd\u201d intent. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-9\">Our Supreme Court confronted the issue of what it means to act \u201clewdly\u201d for purposes of section 314 in <em>Smith, supra, </em>7 Cal.3d at page 362, a case involving a nude sunbather on an isolated beach. After discussing the dictionary definition of the word \u201clewd\u201d and various cases in which the courts had defined that word in the context of a different criminal statute, the Supreme Court concluded that \u201ca person does not expose his private parts \u2018lewdly\u2019 within the meaning of. section 314 unless his conduct is sexually motivated. Accordingly, a conviction of that offense requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the actor not only meant to expose himself, but intended by his conduct to direct public attention to his genitals for purposes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>of sexual arousal, gratification, or affront.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 366.) The court went on to conclude that \u201cmere nudity does not constitute a form of sexual \u2018activity\u2019 \u201d and that \u201c[a]bsent additional conduct intentionally directing attention to his genitals for sexual purposes, a person, as here, who simply sunbathes in the nude on an isolated beach does not \u2018lewdly\u2019 expose his private parts within the meaning of section 314.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">Recently, Division One of the Second Appellate District addressed the lewdness element of section 314 in a juvenile delinquency case arising from a \u201cmooning\u201d incident. <em>(In re Dallas W. </em>(2000) 85 Cal.App.4th 937 [102 Cal.Rptr.2d 493] <em>(Dallas).) </em>It is from the decision in <em>Dallas </em>that defendant draws his argument in this case. Accordingly, we turn our attention to that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">In <em>Dallas, </em>after a 16-year-old boy \u201ctwice stopped to moon oncoming traffic\u201d while walking with friends along a public street, he was charged by delinquency petition with indecent exposure in violation of section 314, subdivision 1.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>(Dallas, supra, </em>85 Cal.App.4th at p. 938.) In sustaining the petition, the juvenile court specifically found the youth had not acted with \u201c \u2018sexual intent in the sense that he intended to arouse himself or a third person by his act,\u2019 \u201d but that he had \u201c \u2018exposed his buttocks . . . with the intent to annoy and affront people.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">On appeal, the appellate court reversed the order sustaining the petition because, in its estimation, there was no evidence the youth had bared his buttocks \u201clewdly.\u201d <em>(Dallas, supra, </em>85 Cal.App.4th at p. 939.) In so concluding, the court focused on the Supreme Court\u2019s discussion of lewdness in Smith\u2014specifically, on that part of <em>Smith </em>in which the Supreme Court held that a conviction of indecent exposure in violation of section 314 requires proof that the defendant exposed himself \u201cfor purposes of sexual arousal, gratification, or affront.\u201d <em>(Smith, supra, 1 </em>Cal.3d at p. 366.) According to the appellate court, the juvenile court had misunderstood the lewdness requirement of section 314, as explained in <em>Smith, </em>because \u201c[t]he juvenile court thought it was enough that Dallas had acted with the intent to \u2018affront.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Dallas, supra, </em>85 Cal.App.4th at p. 939.) The appellate court explained that simple affront was not enough; instead, \u201c[a]s used in <em>Smith, </em>the word \u2018sexual\u2019 modifies \u2018arousal,\u2019 \u2018gratification,\u2019 and \u2018affront,\u2019 not just \u2018arousal\u2019 and \u2018gratification.\u2019 [Citation.] \u2018Affront\u2019 must be read as \u2018sexual affront.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The appellate court then went on to conclude that the juvenile court\u2019s factual findings actually precluded a finding that the defendant acted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>\u201clewdly,\u201d as that term was interpreted in <em>Smith: </em>\u201cFor us, the bottom line is the juvenile court\u2019s finding that Dallas acted only to annoy and affront people and <em>not </em>with \u2018sexual intent in the sense that he intended to arouse himself or a third person by his act.\u2019 Dallas may have been guilty of some other offense (see \u00a7\u00a7 370, 372), and he certainly exhibited bad judgment and poor taste\u2014but the trial court\u2019s findings make it clear that Dallas did not violate section 314.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 940.)</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">Relying on <em>Dallas, </em>defendant contends \u201cthere was no evidence to suggest [he] had a sexual motive in exposing his penis\u201d to the victim because, while \u201cthe evidence certainly supports a finding that [he] intended to offend or annoy\u201d the victim, the evidence does not support a finding he intended to \u201csexually arouse her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">To the extent the opinion in <em>Dallas </em>suggests a person does not violate section 314 if he does not intend \u201c \u2018to arouse himself or a third person by his act\u2019 \u201d <em>(Dallas, supra, </em>85 Cal.App.4th at p. 940), that suggestion is contrary to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Smith. </em>As the Supreme Court made clear, a person acts \u201clewdly\u201d for purposes of section 314 if he exposes himself \u201cfor purposes of sexual arousal, gratification, <em>or </em>affront.\u201d <em>(Smith, supra, </em>7 Cal.3d at p. 366, italics added.) We agree with the <em>Dallas </em>court that the Supreme Court intended the word \u201csexual\u201d to modify all three words that follow it. However, contrary to the suggestion of the <em>Dallas </em>court\u2019s decision, because the word \u201csexual\u201d modifies \u201caffront,\u201d to violate section 314 a defendant does not have to act for purposes of either sexual arousal or sexual gratification. Instead, it is enough if the defendant exposed himself for purposes of \u201csexual affront.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The issue presented here is whether the evidence in this case was sufficient to allow the jury to find defendant acted for purposes of sexual affront, rather than purposes of <em>nonsexual </em>affront. We conclude it was.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">To \u201caffront\u201d someone is \u201cto insult especially] to the face by behavior or language.\u201d (Webster\u2019s 10th New Collegiate Dict. (2000) p. 20, col. 2.) A synonym for \u201caffront\u201d is \u201coffend.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em> Thus, a defendant who intentionally exposes \u201chis person, or the private parts thereof\u2019 to another for the purpose of <em>sexually </em>insulting or offending the other person commits indecent exposure in violation of section 314.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>Defendant\u2019s act of exposing his penis in anger during an incident of \u201croad rage,\u201d accompanied by the comment, \u201csuck [my] dick,\u201d can reasonably be characterized as an act undertaken for the purpose of <em>sexual </em>affront. Accordingly, substantial evidence supports defendant\u2019s indecent exposure conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">Scotland, P. J., and Davis, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">Appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied July 31, 2002. Brown, J., did not participate therein. Kennard, J., was of the opinion that the petition should be granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b343-8\"> The court defined \u201cmooning\u201d as \u201c \u2018exhibiting] one\u2019s bare buttocks as a defiant or amusing gesture.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Dallas, supra, </em>85 Cal.App.4th at p. 938, fn. 1, quoting Chapman, American Slang (Harper Paperbacks 1987) p. 289.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b344-7\"> As the <em>Dallas </em>court noted, CALJIC No. 16.220 is ambiguous as to whether <em>sexual </em>affront is required to commit indecent exposure in violation of section 314, subdivision 1. (Dallas, <em>supra, </em>85 Cal.App.4th at p. 940.) That instruction provides, in part, that the defendant must have acted \u201cwith specific intent to direct public attention to one\u2019s [person] [genitals] for the purpose of one\u2019s own sexual arousal or gratification, or that of another, or to affront others.\u201d The propriety of CALJIC No. 16.220 is not at issue in this appeal, however, because the trial judge astutely added the word \u201csexually\u201d before the word \u201caffront,\u201d thereby ensuring the instruction given the jury was a proper statement of the law.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
