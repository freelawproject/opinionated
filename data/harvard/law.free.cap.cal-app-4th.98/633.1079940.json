Hall appeals from a judgment after the trial court denied his petition for writ of mandate to compel respondent, the Court Reporters Board of California (Board), to vacate its order of discipline imposed against Hall\u2019s license. The trial court concluded Hall had engaged in \u201cunprofessional conduct\u201d in the practice of shorthand reporting when, as part of his subcontracting business, he induced other shorthand reporters to perform services on his behalf and then failed to pay them for services rendered. Hall\u2019s sole contention on appeal is that the failure to pay his subcontractors for reporting services, without any evidence that such failure adversely affected the duties or services Hall provided to his clients, is unrelated to the practice of shorthand reporting and not within the Board\u2019s disciplinary jurisdiction. On the record before us, we agree and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">The facts are undisputed. Hall has been a certified shorthand reporter for 40 years. In that capacity, he frequently subcontracted with other shorthand reporters to perform shorthand-reporting services on his behalf. In exchange for Hall\u2019s promises of payment, the subcontractors would perform reporting services for Hall\u2019s clients and provide a complete transcript for Hall to forward to the client. Hall billed the client directly. The subcontractors did not charge Hall\u2019s clients directly, relying instead on Hall for payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">In 1998 the Board filed an accusation against Hall for willful violation of duty, gross negligence and unprofessional conduct (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u00a7 8025, subd. (d)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>) in connection with his failure to pay 18 shorthand reporters a total of $23,875.78 for services performed on his behalf from May 1991 through July 1997. On November 22, 1999 the Board filed a supplemental accusation charging Hall with failure to pay six additional shorthand reporters a total of $5,798.72 from May 1997 through April 1999. Both accusations included charges of willful violation of duty, gross negligence, and unprofessional conduct; neither charged fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">Hall stipulated to the allegations of nonpayment but argued that failure to pay subcontractors did not subject his license to discipline. At a hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>before the administrative law judge (ALJ), Hall explained he was unable to pay the reporters on occasion due to hard economic times and financial difficulties. He admitted that in many cases he did not pay the reporters even though the client had paid him for the services rendered. He explained his shorthand reporters were paid from a common pool of funds and not from the funds collected from a specific client; economic downturns had taken their toll on the pool, leaving little or no money for Hall to compensate his subcontractors.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">The Board\u2019s expert witness, Lois Ludwig, a practicing court reporter for 30 years and owner of a deposition agency, testified it was standard practice in the industry for certified reporters to enter into oral subcontracts with other shorthand reporters to perform reporting services and to pay those reporters promptly, irrespective of whether the client paid for the services. Ludwig opined that Hall\u2019s failure to pay the shorthand reporters for work provided constituted unprofessional conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">Hall introduced evidence that in 1991, in a written response to a complaint from a shorthand reporter whom Hall failed to pay, the Board stated: \u201cWhile the [Board] certainly does not condone its licensees not meeting their financial obligations, the Board also has no legal authority in fee matters.\u201d Claiming this letter showed that the Board had admitted it lacked jurisdiction over fee dispute matters, Hall argued the Board was estopped from asserting otherwise in this proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">The ALJ found that Hall\u2019s repeated nonpayment of subcontractors involved more than legitimate fee disputes. Rather, finding that Hall had made express or implied promises of payment to his subcontracting shorthand reporters to induce their services on his behalf, and that Hall knew or should have known those representations were false and that he would not pay the reporters for services rendered, the ALJ concluded Hall\u2019s actions amounted to unprofessional conduct in the practice of shorthand reporting. The ALJ revoked Hall\u2019s certificate, then stayed the revocation and placed Hall\u2019s certificate on probation for three years provided that Hall comply with the terms of probation. In addition, the ALJ ordered Hall to make restitution payments to the shorthand reporters identified in the accusations and to pay $12,000 to the Board as compensation for its costs in investigating and enforcing this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">Hall filed a petition for administrative writ of mandate (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1094.5) in the trial court challenging the order of discipline against his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>license.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The superior court denied the petition and entered judgment in the Board\u2019s favor, finding that Hall\u2019s deliberate and continuous pattern of failing to pay his subcontractors for shorthand reporting services over an eight-year period was \u201ctantamount to fraud\u201d in the performance of a professional service and thus constituted unprofessional conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-4\">Hall filed a timely notice of appeal from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">Hall does not dispute the trial court\u2019s factual findings. Instead, he contends his failure to pay his subcontractors for their shorthand-reporting services, even if determined to be fraudulent, is unrelated to the practice of shorthand reporting and thus does not constitute \u201cunprofessional conduct\u201d in the practice of shorthand reporting as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">1. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b477-9\">On appeal from a judgment denying a petition for administrative writ of mandamus, the reviewing court reviews the record as a whole to determine whether the trial court\u2019s findings are supported by substantial evidence. <em>(Fukuda v. City of Angels </em>(1999) 20 Cal.4th 805, 824 [85 Cal.Rptr.2d 696, 977 P.2d 693].) When the facts are not in dispute and the issue is solely one of statutory interpretation, the Court of Appeal applies its own independent judgment to the legal question and is not bound by the trial court\u2019s interpretation. <em>(Borden v. Division of Medical Quality </em>(1994) 30 Cal.App.4th 874, 879 [35 Cal.Rptr.2d 905].)</p>\n<p id=\"b477-10\">2. <em>Where Fraudulent Conduct in Connection with Nonpayment to Subcontracting Shorthand Reporters Does Not Affect the Shorthand Reporting Services Provided, the Conduct Is Not Accomplished \u201cIn the Practice of Shorthand Reporting\u201d and Does Not Qualify as \u201cUnprofessional Conduct\u201d as Defined in Section 8025</em></p>\n<p id=\"b477-11\">Hall contends nonpayment to subcontractors in connection with shorthand reporting services, even if fraudulent, is not accomplished \u201cin the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>practice of shorthand reporting\u201d as defined in sections 8017 and 8025 and thus does not fall within the Board\u2019s jurisdiction. The Board, although conceding that ordinary fee disputes are outside its jurisdiction, nonetheless contends that a pattern and practice of fraudulently inducing shorthand reporting services through false promises of payment constitutes \u201cunprofessional conduct\u201d in the practice of shorthand reporting and subjects the wrongdoer\u2019s license to discipline.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">Our analysis of the Board\u2019s disciplinary purview begins with a review of the governing statutes. <em>(Flannery v. Prentice </em>(2001) 26 Cal.4th 572, 578 [110 Cal.Rptr.2d 809, 28 P.3d 860].)  We give the words their plain and ordinary meaning while considering each provision of the statutes in context of the entire statutory scheme, avoiding any interpretation leading to absurd results. (Ibid.; <em>DuBois v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 382, 388 [20 Cal.Rptr.2d 523, 853 P.2d 978].)</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">Section 8025, subdivision (d) permits the Board to discipline a licensed shorthand reporter for \u201c[f]raud, dishonesty, corruption, willful violation of duty, gross negligence or incompetence in practice, or unprofessional conduct <em>in the practice of shorthand reporting, </em>ft]] \u2018Unprofessional conduct\u2019 includes, <em>but is not limited to, </em>acts contrary to professional standards concerning confidentiality; impartiality, filing and retention of notes; notifications, availability, delivery, execution and certification of transcripts; and any provision of law substantially related to the duties of a certified shorthand reporter.\u201d (\u00a7 8025, subd. (d), italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">Pointing out that unprofessional conduct is defined in the statute \u201cwithout limitation,\u201d the Board urges that the failure to pay subcontractors, although not expressly defined as unprofessional conduct in the statute, nonetheless falls within that broad definition, and that fraud in connection with professional services is necessarily \u201cunprofessional conduct.\u201d The question presented, however, is not whether a fraudulent misrepresentation to induce shorthand reporting services constitutes \u201cunprofessional conduct\u201d in the abstract, but whether such unprofessional conduct can be said to occur \u201cin the practice of shorthand reporting,\u201d (\u00a7 8025, subd. (d)), thus bringing the objectionable conduct within the Board\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">To determine whether the misconduct occurred \u201cin the practice of shorthand reporting,\u201d we examine the plain language of the statute. \u201cThe practice of shorthand reporting is defined as the making, by means of written symbols or abbreviations in shorthand or machine shorthand writing, of a verbatim record of any oral court proceeding, deposition, court ordered hearing or arbitration . . . and the accurate transcription thereof.\u201d (\u00a7 8017.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>This definition limits \u201cthe practice of shorthand reporting\u201d to include those acts relating to shorthand reporting duties, such as preparation and execution of the transcript, and does not include business or accounting practices incident to those duties. The omission is significant. Unlike other areas of the law in which the Legislature has enacted statutes permitting disciplinary action for failure to pay subcontractors<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> or to subject misconduct to discipline even when it occurs outside of the profession,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the Legislature has omitted similar requirements in the licensing statutes relating to court reporters. (See <em>Gray v. Superior Court </em>(2002) 95 Cal.App.4th 322, 328 [115 Cal.Rptr.2d 477] [Legislature knows how to provide for dismissal in sexual predator cases and its silence in statute is strong indication of legislative intent not to allow dismissal].)</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">The Board suggests that inducement to perform reporting services with false promises of payment is conduct \u201cin the practice of shorthand reporting\u201d because the client would not have been provided with the shorthand reporting services but for the subcontractors\u2019 performance. The same argument can be made with respect to any other subcontractor assisting the licensee in carrying out his or her duties. Nothing in the statutory scheme suggests it was designed to ensure the licensee\u2019s compliance with its payment obligations to its employees or subcontractors, whether they are shorthand reporters, accountants, lawyers or other professionals or personnel hired to assist the licensee in carrying out his or her reporting duties to the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">Our conclusion is consistent with the statute\u2019s declared legislative purpose. In enacting the shorthand reporter licensing scheme, the Legislature declared: \u201cThis chapter is designed to establish and maintain a standard of competency for those engaged in the practice of shorthand reporting, for the protection of the public, in general, and for the protection of all litigants whose rights to personal freedom and property are affected by the competency of shorthand reporters, in particular.\u201d Notably, we are not faced here <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>with evidence that failure to pay subcontractors for reporting services compromised the services Hall provided to his clients. Although it is possible to conceive of circumstances where the failure to pay subcontractors for shorthand reporting services would undermine the declared legislative purpose\u2014 for example, nonpayment may result in a significant delay of services or compromise the integrity of the product delivered\u2014the record in this case is devoid of any such evidence. Therefore, on the limited and undisputed factual record before us, we hold that the failure to pay subcontractors, even if the subcontractors\u2019 services were fraudulently induced, is not \u201cunprofessional conduct <em>in the practice of shorthand </em>reporting\u201d as defined in sections 8015 and 8025, although such conduct may be subject to other remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">Significantly, neither the accusation nor the supplemental accusation charged Hall with fraud. We are, therefore, not faced with the question whether fraudulent conduct <em>relating </em>to shorthand reporting, as opposed to fraudulent conduct \u201cin the practice of shorthand reporting,\u201d would be sufficient to subject Hall\u2019s license to discipline. Specifically, as we explained, to constitute unprofessional conduct, the fraudulent conduct must occur \u201cin the practice of shorthand reporting.\u201d (\u00a7 8025, subd. (d).) However, section 8025, subdivision (d) also mandates discipline for \u201c[f]raud, dishonesty, corruption, willful violation of duty, gross negligence or incompetence in practice . . . .\u2019\u2019It would appear \u201cin the practice of shorthand reporting\u201d is a limitation applying only to \u201cunprofessional conduct,\u201d and that \u201cfraud\u201d as a ground for discipline in section 8025, subdivision (d) is subject only to the more general constitutional limitation requiring licensing statutes to be interpreted to include a required nexus between the licensee\u2019s conduct and practice (see <em>Marek v. Board of Podiatric Medicine </em>(1993) 16 Cal.App.4th 1089, 1096 [20 Cal.Rptr.2d 474] [to pass constitutional muster, statute allowing for suspension of license must be read to include a requirement that the misconduct relate to licensee\u2019s fitness to practice profession]).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Nonetheless, because the Board never alleged fraud as a basis for discipline, we need not resolve this question of statutory interpretation or the corollary question whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>fraudulent inducement of shorthand-reporting services from his subcontractors, if proved, would relate to Hall\u2019s fitness to practice shorthand reporting sufficiently to subject his license to discipline.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b481-4\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">The judgment of the superior court is reversed. The cause is remanded to the superior court with instructions to grant the petition for writ of administrative mandamus, directing the Board to set aside its order of discipline, and to take any such further action as is proper in accordance with this decision. Hall is entitled to recover costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">Lillie, P.
