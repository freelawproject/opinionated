Lopez, who was shot in the head by another patron while attending a nightclub Baca owned, sued Baca for negligence, claiming Baca unreasonably failed to provide security guards to check customers for weapons before allowing them to enter the premises. The trial court concluded Baca did not owe a duty to provide security guards because the shooting in this case was unforeseeable as a matter of law. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-10\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b773-11\">1. <em>Facts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b773-12\">The facts set forth in the parties\u2019 separate statements are undisputed. Baca, owner of El Castillo Nite Club (the club), hired women to solicit the club\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1012\">*1012</page-number>male patrons to buy drinks for them at an elevated price and then paid the women a commission from the proceeds of each sale.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In February 2000 a woman approached Lopez at the club and asked him to buy her a beer. When Lopez refused to pay the elevated price, the woman called Lopez a derogatory name and returned to her male companion. Soon thereafter, the woman\u2019s male companion left the club, returned with a gun and, without \u201cany warning,\u201d shot Lopez in the head. Neither Baca nor Lopez knew the shooter or had seen him in the club before that night.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">The club employed a security guard to check customers for weapons on Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights, but not on weeknights. Lopez was shot on a Tuesday night when no security guard was on duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">2. <em>Proceedings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b774-7\">Lopez sued Baca for negligence, alleging Baca unreasonably failed to provide security guards to protect patrons from violent attacks. Baca brought a motion for summary judgment asserting she owed no duty to hire security guards on weeknights because violent crime at the club was unforeseeable. She claimed she was unaware of any other shootings or \u201caltercations\u201d occurring at the club prior to this incident. She also argued there was no causal connection between the lack of security guards and Lopez\u2019s injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-8\">Lopez opposed the motion, asserting that violent attacks at the club w\u00e9re rampant. Lopez included with his opposition a computer printout from the Los Angeles Police Department purportedly showing reported crimes and arrests at the club between 1995 and 2000. Lopez alleged, without a supporting declaration, that the printout revealed 16 reported crimes at the club\u2019s address between 1995 and 2000, including two assaults with a deadly weapon in August 1995 and in September 1996, respectively, and five robberies between 1995 and 1997. No descriptive details about any of these purported incidents were provided. Lopez also attached reports from the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control, showing it had temporarily suspended the club\u2019s liquor license in 1995 due to the club\u2019s illegal practice of paying employees to solicit customers to buy drinks. One day before the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1013\">*1013</page-number>hearing, Lopez filed a \u201csupplemental separate statement\u201d attaching an additional computer printout from the Los Angeles Police Department, purportedly showing 236 \u201cpolice patrol calls for service\u201d made at the club from January 1995 through July 2000.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">Baca objected to all of these documents, asserting lack of foundation and relevance.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Among other things, Baca insisted that none of the evidence showed prior similar crimes. The trial court sustained Baca\u2019s objections to all of Lopez\u2019s proffered evidence<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and granted summary judgment in Baca\u2019s favor. The court concluded Baca had no duty to provide security guards to protect Lopez because there was no admissible evidence the shooting was foreseeable; alternatively, the trial court held, even if there was such a duty, there was no causal connection between the absence of a security guard and Lopez\u2019s injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">Lopez filed a motion for reconsideration, asserting the same arguments as in his opposition to the summary judgment motion. This time, however, Lopez included narrative police reports describing some of the arrests that took place at the club five years earlier (in 1995), including one assault with a beer bottle, one attempted robbery and a negligent discharge of firearm by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1014\">*1014</page-number>a patron who shot at the floor. Lopez also included a declaration from a \u201csecurity expert\u201d who had reviewed the police records, determined that 60 percent of all the reported crimes at the club took place during the week, and opined that the lack of a security guard was a \u201ccontributing factor in the shooting of Mr. Lopez.\u201d Baca objected to the reconsideration motion on several grounds, including the motion was untimely, contained no \u201cnew or different facts\u201d and was unaccompanied by an affidavit from the moving party attesting to the basis for the motion. The trial court denied Lopez\u2019s reconsideration motion and entered judgment in favor of Baca. Lopez filed a timely appeal from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">Lopez contends the trial court erred in concluding that Baca had no duty to employ security guards during the week. Lopez also insists a triable issue of material fact exists as to whether the absence of a security guard was a \u201csubstantial factor\u201d in bringing about his injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b776-8\">1. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b776-9\">Summary judgment is proper where no triable issue of material fact exists and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c, subd. (c).)  We review the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo, \u201cconsidering all of the evidence the parties offered in connection with the motion (except that which the court properly excluded) and the uncontradicted inferences the evidence reasonably supports. [Citation.]  In the trial court, once a moving defendant has \u2018shown that one or more elements of the cause of action, even if not separately pleaded, cannot be established,\u2019 the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show the existence of a triable issue; to meet that burden, the plaintiff \u2018may not rely upon the mere allegations or denials of its pleadings . . . but, instead, shall set forth the specific facts showing that a triable issue of material fact exists as to that cause of action ....\u2019\u201d <em>(Merrill v. Navegar, Inc. </em>(2001) 26 Cal.4th 465, 476-477 [110 Cal.Rptr.2d 370, 28 P.3d 116]; Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c, subd. (o)(2).) Where the plaintiff fails to satisfy this burden, judgment in favor of the defendant shall be granted as a matter of law. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c, subd. (c).)</p>\n<p id=\"b776-10\">Lopez does not challenge the trial court\u2019s ruling sustaining Baca\u2019s objections to certain evidence offered in opposition to the summary judgment motion. As a result, any issues concerning the correctness of the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1015\">*1015</page-number>court\u2019s evidentiary rulings have been waived. <em>(Villa </em>v. <em>McFerren </em>(1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 733, 739, fn. 4 [41 Cal.Rptr.2d 719]; see <em>Tiernan </em>v. <em>Trustees of Cal. State University &amp; Colleges </em>(1982) 33 Cal.3d 211, 216, fn. 4 [188 Cal.Rptr. 115, 655 P.2d 317]; <em>Badie v. Bank of America </em>(1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 779, 785 [79 Cal.Rptr.2d 273].) We therefore consider all such evidence to have been properly excluded. (See <em>Mansell v. Board of Administration </em>(1994) 30 Cal.App.4th 539, 545-546 [35 Cal.Rptr.2d 574] [not the proper function of Court of Appeal to search the record on behalf of appellants or to serve as \u201cbackup appellate counsel\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">2. <em>The Trial Court Properly Concluded Baca Owed No Duty to Lopez to Provide Security Guards Because the Shooting Was Unforeseeable as a Matter of Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">It is well settled that landowners owe a duty to tenants and invitees to maintain their premises in a reasonably safe condition. <em>(Sharon P. v. Arman, Ltd. </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 1181, 1189 [91 Cal.Rptr.2d 35, 989 P.2d 121] <em>(Sharon P.), </em>disapproved on another ground in <em>Aguilar </em>v. <em>Atlantic Richfield Co. </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 853, fn. 19 [107 Cal.Rptr.2d 841, 24 P.3d 493].) This duty encompasses a responsibility \u201cto take reasonable steps\u201d to secure the premises against <em>\u201cforeseeable </em>criminal acts of third parties that are likely to occur in the absence of such precautionary measures.\u201d <em>(Ann M. </em>v. <em>Pacific Plaza Shopping Center </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 666, 674 [25 Cal.Rptr.2d 137, 863 P.2d 207] <em>(Ann M.), </em>italics added.) Foreseeability in this context is a question of law for the court. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 678.) In analyzing the existence and scope of a landowner\u2019s duty, the court must balance the foreseeability of the harm alleged against the burden of the duty to be imposed\u2014the greater the burden of preventing the harm, the higher the degree of foreseeability required. <em>(Sharon P., </em>at p. 1195.) Because the burden of employing private guards to protect against third party criminal conduct is great, \u201ca high degree of foreseeability is required in order to find that the scope of a landlord\u2019s duty of care includes the hiring of security guards. . . . [T]he requisite degree of foreseeability rarely, if ever, can be proven in the absence of prior similar incidents of violent crime on the landowner\u2019s premises.\u201d <em>(Ann M., </em>at p. 679.)</p>\n<p id=\"b777-7\">a. <em>Lopez has abandoned the theory that the landlord had notice of prior similar crimes occurring on the premises.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b777-9\">In arguing that the trial court erred in concluding that Baca had no duty to hire security guards on weekdays to protect patrons of the club from criminal activity, Lopez does not contend, as he did in the trial court, that prior incidents of similar violent crime occurring at the club obligated Baca to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1016\">*1016</page-number>ensure that adequate security measures were in place to protect the club\u2019s patrons.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Instead, Lopez argues that a <em>Fichera </em>bar is an \u201cinherently dangerous\u201d enterprise, requiring its owner to provide security for its patrons regardless of whether the nightclub experienced any prior incidents of similar criminal conduct. Alternatively, he contends that Baca\u2019s hiring of weekend security guards constitutes the assumption of an enforceable duty to protect patrons even in the absence of foreseeable criminal activity.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">b. <em>There is no evidence that the nightclub was an \u201cinherently </em>dangerous\u201d <em>enterprise.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b778-7\">While conceding that evidence of prior incidents of similar crimes is ordinarily required to establish a duty to hire security guards (see <em>Ann M., supra, </em>6 Cal.4th at p. 679), Lopez insists prior similar crimes evidence is unnecessary in this case because the club\u2019s violation of statutes prohibiting payment of a commission to persons who solicit patrons to buy drinks<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> rendered the club \u201cinherently dangerous.\u201d In <em>Ann M. </em>the Supreme Court left <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1017\">*1017</page-number>open the question whether some commercial property is, by its very nature, so \u201cinherently dangerous that, even in the absence of prior similar incidents, providing security guards will fall within the scope of a landowner\u2019s duty of care.\u201d <em>(Ann M., supra, </em>6 Cal.4th at p. 680, fn. 8.) There, the court intimated without deciding that certain types of property, such as all-night convenience stores and underground parking garages, may provide \u201c \u2018 \u201can especial temptation and opportunity for criminal misconduct\u201d \u2019 \u201d so as to create a duty to provide heightened security measures irrespective of prior incidents of similar conduct. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">More recently, however, in <em>Sharon P., </em>the Supreme Court retreated from its earlier suggestion in <em>Ann M. </em>that some properties could be per se inherently dangerous. Observing that crime is \u201c \u2018endemic in today\u2019s society\u2019 \u201d and that all businesses could attract crime to some extent, the court declined to find underground parking garages inherently dangerous and suggested that the \u201cinherently dangerous\u201d characterization was to be used sparingly, if at all; otherwise all businesses could fall victim to a per se rule that would lead to imposition of liability even in the absence of genuine foreseeability. <em>(Sharon P., supra, </em>21 Cal.4th at p. 1194.)</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">The designation of an \u201cinherently dangerous property,\u201d if such a designation still exists after <em>Sharon P., </em>is reserved for properties that \u201cregardless of their individual physical characteristics and locations\u201d are by their nature, prone to violence. <em>(Sharon P., supra, 21 </em>Cal.4th at p. 1192.) Lopez fails to cite any evidence or any authority \u201cfrom which we may confidently conclude\u201d that <em>all </em>bars or nightclubs, or even those operating in violation of statutes precluding payment for the solicitation of beverages, are by their nature prone to violent criminal attacks and are thus inherently dangerous. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Even if there is room after <em>Sharon P. </em>for some commercial enterprises to be regarded as \u201cinherently dangerous,\u201d requiring security as a matter of law, Lopez has not demonstrated that this enterprise is one of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-7\">c. <em>The landlord did not assume a duty to protect patrons on the weekdays when she hired security guards for the weekends.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b779-9\">Lopez insists that by hiring security guards on the weekends, Baca <em>assumed </em>a duty to provide security at all times and for all purposes irrespective of whether she knew or had reason to know violent attacks would occur on the premises. Lopez relies on <em>Trujillo v. G.A. Enterprises, Inc. </em>(1995) 36 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1018\">*1018</page-number>Cal.App.4th 1105, 1108-1109 [43 Cal.Rptr.2d 36]. In <em>Trujillo, </em>a fast-food restaurant hired a private guard as a security precaution even though no prior incidents of violence had occurred on the premises. When a fight broke out at the restaurant, the security guard took one youth away, leaving the other youthful patrons to continue fighting. One of the injured youths sued the restaurant in a premises liability action. In moving for summary judgment, the restaurant argued, and the trial court agreed, the restaurant owed no duty to protect patrons in the absence of prior similar incidents of violent conduct. The Court of Appeal reversed summary judgment, holding that, although it had no duty to do so, once the restaurant hired the security guard, it assumed a duty to protect customers from criminal attack and could be liable for the guard\u2019s unreasonable behavior under the circumstances. <em>(Ibid.; </em>see also <em>Rotman v. Maclin Markets, Inc. </em>(1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 1709, 1720 [30 Cal.Rptr.2d 130] [\u201c[W]hen someone who is under no obligation to provide a service to another voluntarily undertakes to do so, he will be regarded as having assumed a duty to provide that service, and will be liable for negligence if he fails to use reasonable care in performing that duty.\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">Lopez\u2019s reliance on <em>Trujillo </em>misses the point. If Baca had employed a security guard, she would have assumed a duty and could be held liable if the guard acted unreasonably. <em>(Trujillo v. G.A. Enterprises, Inc., supra, </em>36 Cal.App.4th at p. 1109.) Because Baca did not employ a guard on the night of the shooting, however, there was no voluntary assumption of duty.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">To the extent Lopez\u2019s reliance on Baca\u2019s act of hiring security guards on the weekends is intended to establish that Baca was aware of the potential for violence at the club, at most this evidence suggests she had reason to anticipate that such acts might occur on the weekends, not during the week. (See <em>Joseph E. Di Loreto, Inc. v. O\u2019Neill </em>(1991) 1 Cal.App.4th 149, 161 [1 Cal.Rptr.2d 636] [inferences offered to oppose summary judgment must be reasonably deducible from the evidence and not derived from \u201cspeculation, conjecture, imagination, or guesswork\u201d].) Having waived any issue regarding the correctness of the trial court\u2019s evidentiary rulings and abandoned his claim of \u201cheightened foreseeability\u201d based on the excluded evidence of prior incidents of violent conduct,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Lopez\u2019s claim that Baca owed a duty to protect him from attacks fails as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1019\">*1019</page-number>3. <em>Lopez Cannot Rely on a Negligence Per Se Theory to Defeat Summary Judgment Where Such Allegations Were Not in the Complaint and No Motion Was Made to Amend the Complaint Prior to the Summary Judgment Hearing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">Lopez\u2019s related argument that the violation of statutes precluding solicitation of patrons to purchase alcoholic beverages constitutes negligence per se is also unavailing. Lopez\u2019s complaint alleges only that Baca was negligent in failing to provide security and is devoid of any allegations that the club violated any statute or engaged in the illegal practice of paying women to solicit bar patrons to purchase alcoholic beverages. As Lopez neither alleged in the complaint a claim for negligence per se based on a statutory violation nor requested leave to amend the complaint to state such a theory before opposing the summary judgment motion, he is precluded from relying on that theory as a basis for seeking denial of summary judgment. <em>(Bostrom v. County of San Bemandino </em>(1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 1654, 1663-1664 [42 Cal.Rptr.2d 669] [defendant moving for summary judgment need not negate a legal theory not alleged in the complaint]; <em>580 Folsom Associates </em>v. <em>Prometheus Development Co. </em>(1990) 223 Cal.App.3d 1, 18-19 [272 Cal.Rptr. 227] [plaintiff seeking to defeat summary judgment based on legal theory not alleged in complaint must move to amend complaint before summary judgment hearing].)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">Even if negligence per se had been alleged in the complaint, we would still find summary judgment properly granted. Negligence per se (a presumption of duty and breach based on a defendant\u2019s statutory violation) requires a showing that plaintiff\u2019s injuries resulted from the very acts the statute was designed to prevent. <em>(Alejo </em>v. <em>City of Alhambra </em>(1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 1180, 1184-1185 [89 Cal.Rptr.2d 768].) The question whether the injury results from the kind of occurrence the statute was designed to prevent is a question of law (Lua v. <em>Southern Pacific Transportation Co. </em>(1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 1897, 1901-1902 [9 Cal.Rptr.2d 116]), and one we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1020\">*1020</page-number>find easily resolvable. The statutes in question are \u201cmorals statutes\u201d aimed at prohibiting licensed alcohol sellers from encouraging the purchase of alcohol through employees who are paid to make their hospitality contingent upon a customer\u2019s purchase of an alcoholic beverage. <em>(People v. Holstun </em>(1959) 167 Cal.App.2d 479, 488 [334 P.2d 645].) Assault with a deadly weapon is simply not the type of injury those statutes are designed to prevent.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">The judgment is affirmed. Lopez shall pay Baca\u2019s costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-7\">Woods, L, concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b774-9\"> The undisputed evidence showed that, when a male patron at the club buys a beer for himself, Baca charges S3. When he buys it for a woman who solicits the purchase, Baca charges $6 and pays $3 commission to the woman who solicited the purchase. This practice is illegal. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 303; Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 25657.) The parties refer to the women engaged in this practice as <em>\u201cFicheros,\u201d </em>a Spanish slang term.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b775-7\"> There were, in fact, only 119 calls reflected on the computer printouts, not 236 as claimed by Lopez. The printouts were accompanied by a custodial declaration from the police department attesting that the documents were prepared in the ordinary course of business. The declaration did not contain a description or explanation of the content of the documents.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b775-8\"> With respect to the \u201cprintout of arrests and crimes\u201d submitted with Lopez\u2019s opposition to the motion for summary judgment, Baca\u2019s written evidentiary objections, filed prior to the hearing on the motion in conformity with California Rules of Court, rule 345, stated: \u201cLack of foundation, Evidence Code \u00a7 403; Irrelevant, Evidence Code \u00a7 350; Over-broad; Fails to distinguish between phone inside El Castillo and the public pay phone outside with the same 3054 W. Pico Blvd. Address; Fails to establish prior similar incidents; and Fails to lay foundation between different codes, abbreviations and references.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b775-9\"> Although the dissent states the trial court simply issued a blanket, one sentence ruling sustaining all of Baca\u2019s evidentiary objections without \u201cengaging] in a discussion on those objections\u201d and without \u201callow[ing] [Lopez]\u2019s counsel the opportunity to respond\u201d to the objections (dis. opn., <em>post, </em>at p. 1021), the record shows otherwise. The trial court announced in a tentative ruling its intention to sustain the objections to the prior crimes evidence on foundation and relevance grounds, noting expressly that the evidence on its face appeared to involve mostly drug-related crimes, not criminal conduct similar to that at issue in this case. The court then entertained argument from Lopez\u2019s counsel directed to these specific points of concern, as set forth in the appendix to the dissenting opinion. Unpersuaded by the efforts of Lopez\u2019s counsel to counter the analysis in the tentative ruling, the trial court sustained Baca\u2019s objections. Far from the unconsidered ruling suggested by the dissent, the order sustaining the objections was based on careful consideration of each argument presented. The trial court fully discharged its responsibilities to rule on the evidentiary objections presented. (See <em>City of Long Beach v. Farmers &amp; Merchants Bank </em>(2000) 81 Cal.App.4th 780, 784 [97 Cal.Rptr.2d 140] [\u201cTrial courts have a duty to rule on evidentiary objections. Part of the judicial function in assessing the merits of a summary judgment or adjudication motion involves a determination as to what evidence is admissible and that which is not.\u201d].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b778-8\"> Because Lopez has abandoned the legal theory relating to the prior similar crimes evidence, we do not consider that legal theory or the evidence offered in connection with it on appeal. (See <em>Reyes v. Kosha </em>(1998) 65 Cal.App.4th 451, 466, fn. 6 [76 Cal.Rptr.2d 457] [\u201cAlthough our review of a summary judgment is de novo, it is limited to issues which have been adequately raised and supported in [appellant\u2019s] brief.\u201d]; <em>Kim </em>v. <em>Sumitomo Bank </em>(1993) 17 Cal.App.4th 974, 979 [21 Cal.Rptr.2d 834] [although review on appeal from summary judgment is de novo, it is not the appellate court\u2019s function to address arguments not raised on appeal].) To hold otherwise would negate the doctrine of waiver and require that we undertake a review of all evidentiary exclusions regardless of whether they are relevant to any of the legal arguments raised on appeal. Similarly, we decline the dissent\u2019s invitation to consider the propriety of the order denying Lopez\u2019s reconsideration motion, as Lopez does not raise that issue on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b778-13\"> In his opening brief Lopez states: \u201cThe standard premises liability case usually involves an innocent landowner on whose property allegedly unexpected criminal activity occurs. The issue then becomes whether the landowner had notice of prior similar incidents so that the landowner should have taken precautionary measures. This type of case is exemplified by <em>Ann M.[, supra,] 6 </em>Cal.4th 666. HD The present case, however is not that type of <em>case. Here, the </em>nightclub itself affirmatively created a dangerous condition conducive to violence by operating an illegal <em>Fichera </em>bar. . . .

In addition, although, as the dissent notes, Lopez\u2019s opening brief states \u201cthat the atmosphere of such a place [a <em>Fichera </em>bar] is conducive to crime is further evidenced by police reports concerning [the bar],\u201d (dis. opn., <em>post, </em>fn. 7) Lopez offers the argument expressly to show the <em>Fichera </em>bar was an \u201cinherently dangerous enterprise,\u201d not to show similarity between prior crimes and the instant offense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b778-15\"> Penal Code section 303 makes it a misdemeanor for \u201cany person engaged in the sale of alcoholic beverages, other than in the original package, to employ upon the premises where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1017\">*1017</page-number>the alcoholic beverages are sold any person for the purpose of procuring or encouraging the purchase or sale of such beverages, or to pay any person a percentage or commission on the sale of such beverages for procuring or encouraging such purchase or sale.\u201d The same conduct is also prohibited under Business and Professions Code section 25657.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b780-7\"> Lopez does not cite any authority, nor have we found any, to support his dubious proposition that the assumption of a duty to do \u201cA\u201d (that is, employ security on the weekends) necessarily imposes a duty to do \u201cB\u201d (employ security during the week) as well.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b780-8\"> The reports excluded by the trial court showed only that police were called to the club\u2019s address.

J., Dissenting.</author>\n<p id=\"A3d\">I regretfully but respectfully dissent from what I view as a miscarriage of justice. As the majority opinion itself reminds us, appellate courts are instructed to review the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo and in doing so to consider all of the evidence the parties offered in connection with the motion (except that which the [trial] court properly excluded).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This means we have an affirmative duty to consider all the evidence the parties tendered unless we find the evidence the trial court excluded was properly excluded under operative principles of the law of evidence. Thus, whether appellant formally challenged the trial court\u2019s evidentiary rulings in his briefs to this court is irrelevant. In our de novo review of the summary judgment we cannot properly ignore evidence appellant tendered to the trial court unless we conclude it was properly excluded by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-9\">It clearly would have been the better and safer practice for appellant to have included a specific section in his opening brief labeled \u201cErroneous Evidentiary Rulings.\u201d To do so, however, appellant would have to have asked permission to file a brief much longer than the Rules of Court ordinarily permit. Respondent lodged objections to 19 categories of evidence and as to each listed multiple grounds. I counted 66 separate objections in total. None of them, however, cites a single case or provides any justification or explanation beyond the number of a code section.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-10\">The trial court provided no assistance either, because the judge sustained all 66 of the objections in a single sentence granting all objections. During <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1021\">*1021</page-number>the hearing on the summary judgment motion, appellant\u2019s counsel attempted to argue against certain specific objections to specific pieces of evidence. But the trial court did not attempt to refute appellant\u2019s argument or even engage in a discussion on those objections. Instead the judge merely mentioned some other objection on the list, then did not allow appellant\u2019s counsel the opportunity to respond to that second objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">It is argued the trial judge thoroughly considered these 66 objections before deciding to grant each and every one of them. The record belies that assumption. Attached to this dissent are appendices containing all portions of the record related to the lodging, consideration, and ruling on these objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">Appendix A has the three and a half pages into which Consuelo Baca\u2019s counsel managed to pack his 66 objections to 19 categories of evidence. As the cover page indicates, these objections were lodged only three days before the hearing. Inevitably, as even a cursory review of that appendix reveals, the brevity of this document precluded any written discussion of how and why even one of these objections applies to the item of evidence Baca suggests should be excluded. Somehow, however, the trial judge managed to figure out how each of these objections applied, researched them, and concluded every one of them provided an independent and sufficient reason for excluding the category of evidence against which they were lodged. Having done so, the trial court included a sentence in its tentative ruling sustaining all those objections \u201cfor the reasons given\u201d in appendix A.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-7\">Appendix B has the five pages of transcript from the summary judgment hearing containing the court and counsel\u2019s entire discussion of these 66 objections. When Jose Antonio Lopez\u2019s counsel asks to respond to the exclusion of the first item of evidence\u2014the police reports from the Los Angeles Polie Department\u2014the judge first reminds him the court \u201csustained all the objections for the reasons indicated.\u201d The lawyer then takes one of the specific objections to those reports, the lack of authentication, and points out the documents he submitted include official certifications sufficient to overcome that objection, and also fall within an exception to the hearsay rule and hence that objection was invalid as well. Rather than dispute this response to two of the 66 objections, the trial court merely moves on to another of the objections Baca\u2019s counsel had listed, saying \u201cWell, he also has a relevance objection.\u201d When Lopez\u2019s lawyer volunteers to respond to that objection, too, the judge merely completes the list of other objections to that class of evidence, saying \u201calso overbreath <em>[sic] </em>objection, also objects that the evidence fails to distinguish between a phone inside the bar and public pay phones outside.\u201d Lopez\u2019s counsel is only three words into his response to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1022\">*1022</page-number>these two additional objections when he is interrupted by the trial judge who still has one more from Baca\u2019s list, \u201cFails to establish prior similar incidents, with accent [sic] on the word \u2018similar,\u2019 those are all critical and very sound objections which the court sustained.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">Lopez\u2019s lawyer is not yet discouraged by the trial judge\u2019s complete refusal to engage in any meaningful discussion or justification of any specific objection, and instead responds, \u201cI\u2019m going to address each of the objections, Your Honor.\u201d He starts with what seems to me a completely irrelevant and specious objection\u2014to the effect the police in some instances may have been responding to calls originating from a telephone booth purportedly located just outside the nightclub rather than a phone inside the club. Whether the calls came from one phone or the other appears irrelevant. The calls all related to crimes allegedly occurring on the premises of the nightclub.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">But Lopez\u2019s counsel was drawn into an argument over whether there was such a phone booth and whose responsibility it was to show whether it existed and which calls came from which phone. Even if relevant, this is the kind of objection better left to an Evidence Code section 402 hearing at or immediately before the trial, a factual hearing likely to be much longer than the two pages worth of consideration it received at this summary judgment hearing. To expect a plaintiffs counsel, on three days\u2019 notice, to produce the testimony and documents required to demonstrate which calls originated from where and whether it made any difference is both unrealistic and unfair. To expect him to do the same as to 65 other objections is ridiculous. Summary judgments are just that, summary proceedings. They are not suitable nor designed for the resolution of complex evidentiary issues, especially those involving the proof of foundational facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-7\">In any event, the trial court failed to resolve the tennis match over this particular objection. Instead, while Lopez\u2019s counsel was responding to the relevance objection as to the police \u201ccrime reports\u201d (of the 16 specific crimes at Baca\u2019s nightclub over the prior five years), the court was looking at the \u201cincident reports\u201d (of the 236 responses to calls from the nightclub). This led to a confusing exchange where the lawyer is talking about three assaults with deadly weapons, four robberies, a battery, and a discharge of a gun in the nightclub and the judge responds, \u201cBut it is mostly drug related though. Look at it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b784-8\">It soon becomes clear the trial court is referring to the \u201cincident reports\u201d not the \u201ccrime reports\u201d document and his comments about the crimes being \u201cdrug related\u201d is not correct as to the 16 crimes Lopez\u2019s lawyer was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1023\">*1023</page-number>discussing.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> But this fact, if true, would not even supply valid grounds for excluding the \u201cincident reports\u201d document. The presence of some arguably irrelevant material in a document is not sufficient reason for excluding the entire document, only for excluding those irrelevant portions of the document.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">Apparently realizing the trial judge was not seriously considering any responses to Baca\u2019s 66 objections as to the evidence Lopez already had put before the court, Lopez\u2019s lawyer shifted the discussion to evidence he had been unable to produce for the hearing\u2014the detailed police investigative reports on the robberies, assaults with a deadly weapon and firearms which had occurred during weekday nights the previous five years. These reports, he urged, would clearly document violent criminal activity at Baca\u2019s nightclub. He explained those reports would have been before the court at this summary judgment hearing except the police department was tardy in complying with his subpoena (which it turns out was his third such subpoena for these reports) because they gave priority to such requests in criminal cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">But the trial judge would hear none of it. Nor would he grant a short continuance of the hearing to allow the police department to comply with the order to produce these documents, which it had promised to do within two weeks. (Nor did he allow introduction of these documents when they were attached to the motion for reconsideration a couple of weeks later, accompanied by the earlier subpoenas to the police department, the first one issued some seven months before the summary judgment hearing.) Thus ended the discussion of Baca\u2019s 66 objections, without either Baca\u2019s counsel or the trial judge having explained or provided a valid justification for a single one of those objections nor for the exclusion of a single item of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-7\">Appendix C is the final order granting summary judgment and sustaining all 66 objections to all 19 categories of evidence. It is as close as the trial judge gets to justifying all those rulings. In its entirety this part of the order reads: \u201cGood Cause Having Been Shown Therefor [sic], It Is Ordered . . . HD 1. The court sustains all of defendant\u2019s evidentiary objections filed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1024\">*1024</page-number>on February 13, 2001.\u201d Having excluded nearly all of Lopez\u2019s evidence bearing on the issue of whether violent criminal activity had occurred at Baca\u2019s nightclub prior to Lopez\u2019s near fatal shooting, the trial court order then continues: \u201c2. The reading of all of plaintiff\u2019s evidence reveals that the evidence surviving rulings on evidentiary objections is immaterial as to those issues of foreseeability and causation.\u201d Accordingly, the court grants summary judgment against plaintiff Lopez.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">To properly respond to this blunderbuss of evidentiary pellets, appellant would first have had to reconstruct the possible basis for respondent\u2019s one or two word, general and vague, objections\u2014all 66 of them. Then appellant would have had to discuss why each of those objections was not valid\u2014 often for multiple reasons, as to the particular item of evidence at issue. He would have had to repeat that effort 66 times\u2014and would thereby have to produce a veritable treatise on the law of evidence. That, it seems to me, is an unrealistic responsibility to thrust on this or any other appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">It certainly is beyond what this court or any appellate court should be expected to do. Yet, given what respondent did below\u2014and what the trial court not only permitted but ratified by granting all 66 of these objections with no explanation or justification\u2014this would be the only course of action available to us if we were to fulfill our affirmative duty to determine whether the trial court <em>properly </em>excluded each and every one of these 19 categories of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-7\">At this point, I wish to register the strongest disapproval of the approach adopted below in the presentation and treatment of evidentiary objections in summary judgment proceedings. To allow a party to lodge a barrage of objections, with no supporting factual and legal argument to support them, is to impose an unfair burden on the opposing party. And for a trial court to grant those objections en masse with no explanation for its decisions places an undue burden on the appellate court as well as the opposing party.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-8\">It is difficult to imagine the trial court here individually analyzed these 66 objections and found them all valid under the Evidence Code and relevant decisional authority. A cursory review of the 66 objections reveals many completely lack merit. For others, the merit, if any, certainly is not apparent from the mere label \u201cirrelevant\u201d or \u201clack of foundation\u201d or \u201cvague\u201d or \u201chearsay not falling within any of the hearsay exceptions.\u201d A trial court owes it to this court, if not the parties, to select the specific objections it finds possess merit and explain its grounds for so finding, either in writing or on the record. Here the trial court did neither, and in fact did not defend its decision as to specific objections when its blanket ruling was challenged during the summary judgment hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1025\">*1025</page-number>Merely as an illustration of the questionable nature of the trial court\u2019s blanket affirmative of all 66 of these objections, I make a quick examination of the court\u2019s exclusion of the computer printouts from the police department. The first printout was a summary reflecting 16 reported crimes at the club during a five year period, including two assaults with deadly weapons and five robberies. The other computer printout reflected 236 \u201cpolice patrol reports for service\u201d during that same five years.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">Both of these computer printouts were <em>authenticated </em>as public records.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> They were <em>not hearsay </em>because they were introduced to establish the bar owner had notice of criminal activity,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> not necessarily for the truth of the statements therein. But even if considered hearsay they fall under at least two alternative <em>hearsay </em>exceptions\u2014as public records<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and as business records.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The certifications recited all the foundational facts for either of these exceptions to the hearsay rule\u2014kept in the regular course of police department business, recorded at or near the time of the events reported by declarants who had personal knowledge, etc. From the record of the summary judgment hearing it is apparent the trial court fully comprehended the abbreviations, code sections, etc. the officers employed in these summary reports, thus they were <em>not too vague </em>for the trier of fact on the summary judgment motion. This evidence also is <em>relevant </em>for at least two reasons. First, it contradicts and thus impairs the credibility of the bar owner\u2019s declaration claiming violent crime was unforeseeable and she was unaware of such criminal activity at her club. Second, the substance of these police reports supports an inference strongly supporting a triable issue this bar had experienced significant violent criminal activity prior to the shooting of appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">To fully explain why each of the objections lodged against this evidence lacks merit would require several more pages, and there still would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1026\">*1026</page-number>another 18 categories of evidence and another 60 or so objections to go. But the paragraph above does suggest the daunting task appellant would have faced in preparing a brief responding to the entire roster of objections the trial court sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">Beyond the evidentiary issues, in my view it is not necessary the prior criminal activity be precisely identical to the crime that nearly killed appellant, as the trial judge appeared to intimate. The computer printouts need not reflect past instances where boyfriends of \u201cB-girls\u201d shot bar patrons who didn\u2019t like the idea of paying extra because the girl sitting next to them turned out to like them only for commercial reasons. It is enough those printouts revealed significant <em>violent </em>criminal activity <em>of some kind </em>and/or the unlawful presence and use of firearms on the premises sufficient to suggest the bar owner should provide security officers to protect patrons from the threat of physical injury. The robberies, assaults with deadly weapons (whether guns or others), and patrons possessing and firing weapons (whether negligently or intentionally) reported in these police computer printouts certainly qualify as significant violent criminal activity. At a minimum, they appear sufficient to create a triable issue this bar owner should have employed security officers to protect patrons from physical injury at the hands of third parties. The fact she did employ such officers on the three weekend nights further suggested she was aware of the potential for violent criminal activity at her bar. Only if none of the prior violent crimes were committed on weekday nights would the bar owner lack notice of the need for such preventive measures on those nights. The computer printout of the 16 violent crimes negated that possibility, since a majority of those crimes took place on weekday nights.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">Once the <em>level </em>of prior violent criminal activity warranted security measures, the bar owner failed to provide those measures at her own risk.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> If some other type of violent crime occurred, the bar owner would be liable to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1027\">*1027</page-number>the victim of that crime unless, of course, the security measures required by the prior criminal activity\u2014but which she failed to provide\u2014could not have prevented this new crime. In the case before this court, a triable issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1028\">*1028</page-number>exists whether the prior criminal activity justified the employment of security guards.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">I now move on to the second ground the trial court asserted for granting summary judgment. After excluding all the evidence of prior violent criminal activity and therefore finding there was no need for Baca to employ security guards on weekday evenings, the court also raised the causation issue. \u201cThere\u2019s no showing the failure to provide a security guard caused the shooting. That\u2019s the basic problem.\u201d On this issue, however, the admitted evidence was more than sufficient to create a triable issue the absence of a security guard was a \u201cbut for\u201d and proximate cause of Lopez\u2019s injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">Here the evidence before the court on the summary judgment motion established the victim got into an altercation with the assailant\u2019s girlfriend when the victim discovered she was a B-girl not a fellow customer. The assailant became so enraged he pushed appellant against the wall, then left the bar to get a gun. Still enraged, he returned to the bar with the weapon he retrieved from his car, approached appellant, held the gun to his head, and shot him.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-7\">According to evidence in the record, including respondent\u2019s own deposition, one of the primary duties of the security guards the bar employed on weekends was to search customers for firearms before they entered the premises. Another B-girl employed at the nightclub described in some detail how the weekend security guards patted down patrons before they entered the premises.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> At her deposition, Lopez\u2019s counsel asked this witness, Alma Rosa Granados Aguilar, \u201cDid you also see him [the security guard] checking the men who were going into the nightclub on weekends?\u201d She replied, \u201cYes.\u201d When asked what was done to check them, Ms. Aguilar responded, \u201cHe would check all the way down like this [gesturing down her body].\u201d The lawyer then asked, \u201cSo he would check his legs check his sides, his chest, his pockets? Do you know what he was checking for?\u201d Ms. Aguilar\u2019s response: \u201cSo they wouldn\u2019t have any weapons.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b791-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1029\">*1029</page-number>So had there been a security guard on duty that fateful weekday night there is at least a triable issue this guard would have performed his prime function and prevented the assailant from reentering the premises with the weapon he used to shoot appellant in the head. Indeed, even a moderately observant security guard probably would have intervened at an earlier point in this series of events and prevented the criminal assault\u2014either by restraining or removing the B-girl\u2019s boyfriend. (The presence of such a guard may have been enough in itself to dissuade the assailant from this violent course of action.) Unless we are willing to say these guards lack the required skill as a matter of law we are left with a triable issue on the causation issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">If the trial court erred in excluding the evidence appellant originally tendered, it also erred in refusing to grant appellant\u2019s request for a continuance to procure the more detailed police arrest and incident reports on which the computer printouts were based. During the oral argument on the summary judgment motion, appellant responded to the trial court\u2019s exclusion of the police computer printouts with a request for a short continuance. He advised the court he had subpoenaed the full police reports, including the officers\u2019 notes and the narratives of all the crimes reflected on those printouts and expected to receive those documents shortly. He also advised the court he would have had them long before the hearing except the department told him they were giving priority to such requests in criminal cases. And indeed appellant had first subpoenaed all these police documents seven months before the summary judgment hearing\u2014and only three months after filing his complaint. He also had issued two further subpoenas when the requested police reports were not forthcoming. He ultimately obtained an order requiring the department to turn over the records some four days before the summary judgment hearing, an order the department failed to honor, thus depriving appellant of these detailed investigation reports at the time of the hearing. The police reports finally became available two weeks after that hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">In my view, the trial court abused its discretion in denying appellant the rather short continuance required to acquire and submit the detailed police reports he had subpoenaed over seven months earlier. Appellant had been more than diligent in his efforts to obtain these records from the police department. The trial court\u2019s asserted reason for denying the continuance\u2014 the records should have been subpoenaed earlier\u2014does not square with the facts in the record. Accordingly, I would reverse the denial of the continuance as well and consider the evidence appellant would have been able to put before the trial court had the court granted that request. (By the way, the reconsideration motion is based in part on a claim the trial court erred in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1030\">*1030</page-number>refusing to grant the continuance appellant\u2019s counsel requested during the summary judgment proceedings.)</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">The evidence appellant could not introduce because the trial court denied the requested continuance further strengthens appellant\u2019s claim he had created triable issues on the prior criminal conduct and causation issues. The more specific information as to certain of the crimes listed in the police department\u2019s initial computer printouts bolstered the earlier submission. The computer printouts reflected 12 of 17 crimes occurred on weeknights when the nightclub had no security guards. The police reports gave detailed information about several of the violent crimes which took place on <em>week</em>nights\u2014an attempted robbery, an assault with a deadly weapon, a robbery with a gun, and negligent discharge of a firearm involving a customer who fired seven rounds into the bar. This evidence directly refutes the bar owner\u2019s declaration she knew of no violent activity on her premises during weeknights. Beyond that, this evidence firmly establishes the foreseeability of such criminal acts, including the threat of firearms on the premises, and the need to supply security guards on weeknights as well as weekends.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">For these reasons I conclude there was more than ample evidence to create triable issues as to foreseeability and causation. Unfortunately, the trial court struck this evidence erroneously and in a blanket fashion which imposed an onerous and unfair burden on appellant to oppose and on this court to evaluate the validity of those decisions. Therefore, I would reverse on two grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-7\">First, the trial court\u2019s method of sustaining 66 evidentiary objections (which respondent had failed to explain or justify) with a single sentence should not be effective to sustain any of those objections. Hence all that evidence should be deemed admitted for purposes of this summary judgment motion. Otherwise opposing parties and appellate courts will face impossible burdens in opposing and reviewing these en masse evidentiary rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-8\">Second, I conclude the one major category of evidence discussed in this dissent\u2014the police computer printouts of arrest and incident reports and the reports themselves as to some of those crimes\u2014was both admissible and sufficient in itself to raise triable issues as to the foreseeability of violent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1031\">*1031</page-number>activity. Other evidence not subject to the trial court\u2019s blanket evidentiary ruling established triable issues as to causation. The trial court based its summary judgment on the purported absence of evidence on those two issues. In that, as well as its evidentiary rulings, the trial court was in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">Finally, as treated in the majority opinion, this case raises a fundamental issue about the role of appellate courts in reviewing summary judgments. That opinion relies heavily on two related contentions: First, the appellate court cannot review the propriety of the trial court\u2019s exclusion of some 19 items of evidence because Lopez is deemed to have waived any opposition to those evidentiary rulings. Second, the appellate court cannot consider whether the evidence in the record establishes a triable issue that the level of violent criminal activity required security guards on weekday nights, because Lopez is deemed to have \u201cabandoned\u201d this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">For reasons explained above (see pp. 1020-1024, <em>ante), </em>I conclude Lopez had no responsibility to oppose the trial court\u2019s evidentiary rulings because Baca\u2019s 66 evidentiary objections were not adequately lodged and the trial court did not make sufficient rulings as to any of those objections to which anyone could reasonably respond. Furthermore, also for reasons explained above (see fn. 8, <em>ante), </em>I conclude Lopez did <em>not </em>abandon the argument that the level of violent criminal activity occurring at Baca\u2019s nightclub during weeknights imposed a duty to employ security guards on those nights as well as weekend nights. Instead what he did was emphasize Baca <em>caused </em>that level of violence by operating her nightclub in an illegal manner. She was not simply an innocent property owner operating a socially useful business in a high crime area who experienced enough violent crimes on her premises to require her to take security measures to protect her customers. By employing B-girls in violation of the law, Lopez contended she was <em>responsible </em>for the increased level of violent crimes on her premises. In that sense it was not a \u201cpure notice\u201d case. But this does not mean Lopez \u201cabandoned\u201d any contention the violent criminal activity on the premises required security guards.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-7\">Nonetheless, for the sake of discussion, I will assume appellant\u2019s opening brief should have challenged the propriety of the trial court\u2019s order sustaining the 66 objections in his opening brief. Furthermore, I will assume he did not properly raise and argue the position that the prior violent criminal activity Baca\u2019s nightclub experienced on weeknights imposed a duty to employ security guards on those nights as well as weekends. This leaves the question whether an appellate court is a \u201cpotted plant\u201d unable to consider issues unless they are spoon fed by the parties. Reading a record redolent with error, must we ignore the stench just because the lawyers failed to rub our noses in it? I don\u2019t think so.</p>\n<p id=\"AfP\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1032\">*1032</page-number>Indeed, the practices of this division and most if not all other appellate courts in this state belie such an approach to the appellate function. As of the moment this majority opinion and my dissent are filed, this division has at least one and probably more letters out to counsel in other cases requesting them to brief issues the aggrieved party failed to raise in the original round of briefing. In the past 20 years, I know of literally scores of cases we have decided based on issues not raised in the briefs. Among other situations during that period, we have affirmed summary judgments based on alternative grounds not mentioned in the respondents\u2019 briefs, and we have reversed summary judgments based on triable issues we found in the record, which appellants had failed to identify in their briefs. Indeed, this practice is so common the law was changed over a decade ago to require appellate courts to provide both sides an opportunity to respond when the appellate court elects to decide a case on an issue not discussed in the briefs.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">It is difficult to see how it could be otherwise. The Courts of Appeal, more than the Supreme Court, are in the \u201cerror correction\u201d business. For all cases of that genre, where no important unsettled legal issues are at stake, we are indeed the \u201ccourt of last resort.\u201d This is a great responsibility. The parties depend upon us to insure justice was done in the trial court\u2014that the judges there applied the correct legal principles to the true facts of the case. These are not contests to choose which lawyer did the best job. Nor, at the appellate level, should a party suffer because his or her lawyers were inept in their briefing. If the court\u2019s research\u2014including its own independent research\u2014demonstrates the correct legal principles when applied to the facts revealed in the record yield a certain result, then that should be the judgment of the court. The lawyers\u2019 lapses should not and cannot relieve the appellate court of its duty nor disarm it of its ability to insure the parties receive justice in the trial courts of this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">Thus, even assuming appellant\u2019s lawyer, in his briefing, erroneously waived the evidentiary issues and \u201cabandoned\u201d the key substantive issue, I would regard it as irrelevant in this case. If this court fulfills its duty to apply the correct legal principles to the record before it, certain propositions are crystal clear: First, the evidence of prior violent criminal activity was admissible and thus improperly excluded. Second, this evidence was sufficient, at a minimum, to create a triable issue Baca had sufficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1033\">*1033</page-number>notice to have a duty to employ security guards on weeknights at her nightclub. And third, uncontested evidence was sufficient, at the least, to create a triable issue the security guards, had they been on duty, would have disarmed or restrained the assailant and thus prevented him from shooting Lopez in the head. This is enough to reverse summary judgment in this case, and I would do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">On June 5, 2002, the opinion was modified to read as printed above.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1034\">*1034</page-number>Appendix A</p>\n<p id=\"AXV\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b797-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1035\">*1035</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1036\">*1036</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b799-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1037\">*1037</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1038\">*1038</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b801-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1039\">*1039</page-number>Appendix B</p>\n<p id=\"AV2l\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1040\">*1040</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b803-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1041\">*1041</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1042\">*1042</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b805-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1043\">*1043</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b806-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1044\">*1044</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b807-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1045\">*1045</page-number>Appendix C</p>\n<p id=\"Akk\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1046\">*1046</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b782-12\"><em> Merrill v.

It is true Lopez relied heavily, in his briefs, on the arguments the majority opinion emphasizes. He did argue the employment of security guards on weekends tended to support the inference they were required on weeknights, too. And he also argued Baca\u2019s employment of B-girls increased the risk of violence and thus increased the need for security guards at all times. (Incidentally, in my view, there is some merit in both these positions, that is, when deciding whether the foreseeability of violent criminal conduct on weeknights has reached the level requiring employment of security guards, both these factors raise that level somewhat.) But in stressing these two factors, Lopez did not abandon his claim the prior violent criminal activity on weeknights also required Baca to employ security guards on weekday nights.</p>\n<p id=\"AiV\">In the \u201cStatement of the Case\u201d in his opening brief, appellant emphasizes the \u201cfifteen arrests for criminal incidents including robberies, assaults with a deadly weapon, attempted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1027\">*1027</page-number>robbery, a <em>gun </em>discharge, and a battery over the previous five years.\u201d Later he mentions the B-girl operation created a dangerous situation, but says that led to \u201ca history of violence\u201d and \u201cthere were 199 police calls at the nightclub address in the five years before the incident.\u201d He then devotes a full one-thitd of his \u201cStatement of Facts\u201d to the testimony of an expert whose review of the evidence showed the police records of all these violent crimes and that 60 percent occurred during weekday nights. (In determining whether appellant \u201cabandoned\u201d the violent prior criminal activity argument in his briefing, it is irrelevant this particular expert\u2019s testimony may not have been admissible in the summary judgment motion. As demonstrated above, the evidence of this prior violent criminal activity was present elsewhere in the record.)</p>\n<p id=\"Ati\">In the \u201cArgument\u201d portion of the brief, Lopez\u2019s counsel first addressed \u201cDuty\u201d and continued to point to the prior violent crimes as evidence Baca had a duty to employ security guards. \u201cThat the atmosphere of such a place is conducive to crime is further evidenced by the police reports concerning El Castillo. El Castillo is essentially a magnet for crime. The nightclub had previously experienced violent incidents such as robbery, battery, and assault with a deadly weapon - the incident which occurred in the present case.\u201d The fact Lopez argued Baca had caused the violent criminal acts to occur by operating an illegal \u201cfiscera\u201d nightclub does not mean Lopez had somehow \u201cabandoned\u201d the argument this pattern of prior criminal acts made future crimes foreseeable and therefore created a duty. Indeed, unless the operation of the nightclub resulted in criminal activity there would be no need to employ security guards.</p>\n<p id=\"AJl\">In the \u201cBreach of Duty\u201d section of his brief, Lopez once again relied in part on the existence of prior criminal activity, arguing, \u201c[e]ven if the present case is treated as a purely notice case where the only question is whether the innocent defendant had notice that criminal acts were foreseeable, it is apparent that El Castillo had notice.\u201d And later, he argues, \u201cThe primary role of the security guards at El Castillo was to check for weapons, thereby demonstrating that El Castillo recognized that its operation attracted patrons with weapons. fi[| . . . There is nothing to show that days such as Tuesdays are immune from the danger present on other days. ... 60 percent of the serious incidents reported by the Los Angeles Police Department at El Castillo occurred Monday through Thursday.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A5O\">This does not sound like an appellant whose opening brief has waived or abandoned the argument that Baca had notice of enough prior criminal activity at her nightclub during weekday nights to require her to employ security guards. In his reply brief, Lopez makes alternative arguments. First, he argues the police reports and other evidence of prior criminal activity were erroneously excluded. Second, he argues, assuming such evidence remains properly excluded on appeal, the other admitted evidence was sufficient to defeat summary judgment. So even in his reply brief, Lopez does not \u201cabandon\u201d his argument that prior violent activity established foreseeability. He merely provides a series of fallback arguments in case we rule that evidence inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"A7v\">\u201cWhile this evidence was excluded below, it is admissible hearsay to show that El Castillo had been running an illegal Fichera bar for years where the nightclub address was a magnet for criminal activity and had a long police record. HQ The main function of this additional evidence was to show prior similar incidents but such incidents are not necessary to the resolution of this case.\u201d Lopez then proceeds to use the unobjected to evidence to establish his fallback positions\u2014Baca ran an illegal operation which was inherently dangerous and thus had a special duty to employ security guards and/or she had assumed the duty to employ security guards and breached that duty by failing to employ them on weekday nights.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b790-8\"> The trial court evidently misunderstood the true facts as reflected in the record. Somehow the judge gained the impression the assailant merely walked in off the street and shot Lopez\u2014rather than being present in the bar, becoming angry when Lopez refused a high priced beer for the assailant\u2019s B-girl girlfriend, physically assaulting Lopez, and then going out to his car and returning with a gun. During the summary judgment hearing the trial judge first said, \u201cI know the whole history of the case. I\u2019ve read it backwards and forwards.\u201d Shortly thereafter, the judge said, \u201cHow did [the B-girl] activity contribute to this unfortunate event where somebody walks in off the street and puts a bullet in your client\u2019s head?\u201d Obviously, the motive for this particular shooting arose directly from the B-girl activity at the nightclub and was not a random shooting by someone wandering in off the street. But there is at least a triable issue the presence of security guards would have prevented the shooting under either scenario, because the guards had the duty to search and disarm anyone entering the nightclub.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b792-9\"> I don\u2019t think it is necessary or important to decide whether this court should also consider the expert testimony appellant tendered with his reconsideration motion. Unlike the detailed police reports it is not evidence appellant\u2019s counsel mentioned in his request for a continuance. But if considered, the expert\u2019s testimony, especially his opinion fully 60 percent of the criminal activity at the bar occurred on weekday nights, is yet further, very powerful evidence demonstrating foreseeability and supporting a duty to supply security guards on weeknights in order to protect patrons from violent criminal acts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b794-7\"> \u201cBefore the Supreme Court, a court of appeal, or the appellate department of a superior court renders a decision in a proceeding other than a summary denial of a petition for an extraordinary writ, based upon an issue which was not proposed or briefed by any party to the proceeding, the court shall afford the parties an opportunity to present their views on the matter through supplemental briefing.
