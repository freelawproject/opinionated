J.</author>\n<p id=\"AV2\">Following convictions for possession of heroin and receiving stolen property, with true findings as to four \u201cstrike\u201d prior convictions and a subsequent life sentence under the \u201cThree Strikes\u201d law (Pen. Code,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u00a7 667, subds. (b)-(i)), Rodolfo Torres Mantanez appeals. Mantanez argues the evidence does not support his conviction for receiving stolen property, his suppression motion was erroneously denied, and also, relying on recent cases decided by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, Mantanez argues his sentence is cruel and unusual in light of the relatively minor nature of the present offenses of which he was convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-11\">For the reasons which follow, we reject the challenges to the sufficiency of and admission of the evidence. Also, as we believe the Ninth Circuit cases noted above were not correctly decided, we decline to follow them, and we affirm the judgment and sentence imposed on Mantanez herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-12\">Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b308-13\">On September 21, 2000, in Carlsbad, the Oak Street home of Mariana Ramirez was burglarized and some of her jewelry was taken. On the evening of October 4, 2000, Carlsbad Police Officer George Hart, patrolling Chestnut Street, not far from Oak Street, saw Mantanez. Hart, who knew Mantanez and had often spoken with him, decided to contact Mantanez, who had always been cooperative in the past.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>The two exchanged greetings. Officer Hart noted that Mantanez appeared to be under the influence of both heroin and a stimulant. Hart did a radio check for warrants, and also took Mantanez\u2019s pulse. At this point Hart determined Mantanez was indeed under the influence of drugs and determined to arrest him.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">Hart called for backup, and Officer Philip Cable arrived. Mantanez was searched following his arrest. A syringe and .25 grams of tar heroin were found on his person. Mantanez also had several items of women\u2019s jewelry in his possession. Officer Cable noted that a ring Mantanez had matched the description of an item taken in the Ramirez burglary two weeks earlier. Mrs. Ramirez identified other items Mantanez had (but not all of them) as having been taken from her home in the burglary. A blood test revealed Mantanez had ingested heroin and amphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">By amended information filed March 26, 2001, the District Attorney of San Diego County accused Mantanez of one count of possessing heroin in violation of Health and Safety Code section 11350, subdivision (a), and in a second count of receiving stolen property in violation of section 496, subdivision (a). It was further alleged Mantanez had incurred six prison prior convictions within the meaning of section 667.5, subdivision (b). It was further alleged that three of those prison priors were strike prior convictions within the meaning of the Three Strikes law.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">A motion to suppress evidence brought pursuant to section 1538.5 was heard and denied in the superior court on June 1, 2001. On June 21, 2001, a jury found Mantanez guilty of heroin possession and receiving stolen property, and in a court trial the prior conviction allegations were all found to be true.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-9\">On September 14, 2001, Mantanez was sentenced. The court stated that \u201cif this case involved drugs only,\u201d in the case of a multidecade narcotics addict, he might be inclined to strike one or more of the strike prior convictions, but the current conviction for receiving stolen property also, considered with Mantanez\u2019s long history of burglary and narcotics offenses, militated against such an exercise of discretion. The court imposed a 25-year-to-life sentence for the receiving count, a concurrent like term for the drug possession, and three 1-year prison prior enhancements.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"A22\">I, II<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">Cruel and Unusual Punishment</p>\n<p id=\"AY9\">A. <em>Question Presented</em></p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">Mantanez also asserts that, in light of the relatively minor nature of his current offenses, the Three Strikes 25-year-to-life sentence he received constitutes cruel and unusual punishment under the United States and California Constitutions.  On federal constitutional questions, of course, the decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States control, , while the decisions of lower federal courts are \u201cpersuasive but not controlling.\u201d <em>(People v.

It is not cruel and unusual punishment to enhance the penalty for a crime because the defendant is a recidivist <em>(People </em>v. <em>Jameson </em>(1986) 177 Cal.App.3d 658, 661-662 [223 Cal.Rptr. 108]) as long as the ultimate punishment, all facts considered, is not disproportionate to the crime. <em>(Solem v. Helm </em>(1983) 463 U.S. 277, 284-288 [103 S.Ct. 3001, 3006-3009, 77 L.Ed.2d 637] <em>(Solem); Harmelin v. Michigan </em>(1991) 501 U.S. 957, 997 [111 S.Ct. 2680, 2702-2703, 115 L.Ed.2d 836] (conc. opn. of Kennedy, J.) <em>(Harmelin).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">While arguing his sentence is disproportionate to the crime, Mantanez relies on <em>Solem, supra, </em>463 U.S. 277, which held it cruel and unusual punishment to imprison a nonviolent recidivist to a life term without the possibility of parole. However, when discussing the proportionality of a sentence, the Supreme Court in <em>Solem </em>set forth as guidelines the same factors as expressed in <em>In re Lynch, supra, </em>8 Cal.3d 410. Thus, <em>Solem </em>adds no additional analysis to <em>Lynch.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">When faced with recidivist defendants such as Mantanez, California appellate courts have consistently found the Three Strikes law is not cruel and unusual punishment. (See, e.g., <em>People v. Cooper </em>(1996) 43 Cal.App.4th 815, 826-827 [51 Cal.Rptr.2d 106]; <em>People v. Ingram </em>(1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 1397, 1413 [48 Cal.Rptr.2d 256].) The only authority cited by Mantanez supporting his present claim of error are a pair of decisions of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which, for reasons set out later, we decline to follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">2. <em>Rummel, Solem and Harmelin</em></p>\n<p id=\"b311-9\">Three decisions of the United States Supreme Court inform our analysis. In 1980, the court reviewed the following question: does a life sentence under a recidivist statute for a third felony theft offense constitute cruel and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment?<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>(Rummel, supra, </em>445 U.S. at pp. 270-271 [100 S.Ct. at pp. 1136-1138].) Observing at the beginning of their analysis that \u201c[o]utside the context of capital punishment, successful challenges to the proportionality of particular sentences have been exceedingly rare,\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 272 [100 S.Ct. at p. 1738]), five justices answered the question in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">The <em>Rummel </em>majority rejected Rummel\u2019s arguments that the Texas penalty was one of the three most severe in the nation, finding little relevance in the point, and noting also the obvious fact that some state penalty must always be the most severe does not mean that penalty is necessarily disproportionate. The fact of recidivism is, of course, central to the holding of <em>Rummel,</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and it is precisely such recidivism which created the particular circumstances in which Mantanez today faces a sentence he asserts is cruel and unusual.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">Three years later, in another five-to-four decision,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the court considered \u201cwhether the Eighth Amendment proscribes a life sentence without possibility of parole for a seventh nonviolent felony.\u201d <em>(Solem, supra, </em>463 U.S. at p. 279 [103 S.Ct. at p. 3004].) According to the <em>Solem </em>majority, the Eighth Amendment proscribes not only punishments which are \u201cbarbaric,\u201d but also \u201csentences that are disproportionate to the crime committed.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 284 [103 S.Ct. at p. 3006].) The <em>Solem </em>majority went on to hold that \u201ca court\u2019s proportionality analysis under the Eighth Amendment should be guided by objective criteria, including (i) the gravity of the offense and the harshness of the penalty; (ii) the sentences imposed on other criminals in the same jurisdiction; and (iii) the sentences imposed for commission of the same crime in other jurisdictions.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>(Id. </em>at p. 292 [103 S.Ct. at p. 3011].)</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>Applying the \u201cobjective\u201d criteria, the <em>Solem </em>majority distinguished the life sentence in <em>Rummel </em>by noting Rummel was eligible for parole in 12 years, while Helm\u2019s sentence was without possibility of parole, and was thus (in a state without capital punishment at the time) \u201cthe most severe punishment that the State could have imposed on any criminal for any crime.\u201d <em>(Solem, supra, </em>463 U.S. at p. 297 [103 S.Ct. at p. 3013].)</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">Thus, the <em>Solem </em>majority held, \u201c[a]pplying objective criteria, we find that Helm has received the penultimate sentence for relatively minor criminal conduct. He has been treated more harshly than other criminals in the State who have committed more serious crimes. He has been treated more harshly than he would have been in any other jurisdiction, with the possible exception of a single State. We conclude that his sentence is significantly disproportionate to his crime, and is therefore prohibited by the Eighth Amendment.\u201d <em>(Solem, supra, </em>463 U.S. at p. 303 [103 S.Ct. at pp. 3016-3017].)</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">The <em>Solem </em>majority (the former <em>Rummel </em>minority) insisted that <em>Solem </em>did not overrule <em>Rummel, </em>but was distinguishable because the life without possibility of parole sentence in <em>Solem </em>was \u201cfar more severe than the life sentence we considered in Rummel.\u201d <em>(Solem, supra, </em>463 U.S. at p. 297 [103 S.Ct. at p. 3013].) The dissent in <em>Solem, </em>however, asserted that <em>Rummel </em>had instead \u201ccategorically rejected the very analysis adopted\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 308 [103 S.Ct. at p. 3019] (dis. opn. of Burger, C. J.).) by the <em>Solem </em>majority, and argued that stare decisis and \u201ca decent regard for the orderly development of the law and the administration of justice requires that directly controlling cases be either followed or candidly overruled.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 312 [103 S.Ct. at p. 3021].)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The dissent also predicted that \u201c[b]y asserting the power to review sentences of imprisonment for excessiveness the Court launches into uncharted and unchartable waters.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 314 [103 S.Ct. at p. 3022].) In the event, quite so.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>The accuracy of the last-cited prediction was validated eight years after <em>Solem, </em>when the court again visited the Eighth Amendment, in <em>Harmelin, supra, </em>501 U.S. 957. <em>Harmelin </em>involved not a recidivist statute, but a life without parole sentence for the first offense of possessing 672 grams of cocaine. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 961 [111 S.Ct. at p. 2684].) <em>Harmelin </em>produced no majority opinion, although five justices agreed the mandatory life without possibility of parole sentence did not violate the Eighth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">Two justices (Scalia, joined by Rehnquist) in <em>Harmelin </em>presented an historical analysis of the Eighth Amendment, which returned to the <em>Rummel </em>principle<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> that the actual length of felony sentences \u201c \u2018is purely a matter of legislative prerogative\u2019 \u201d and went on to argue that <em>Solem, </em>with its \u201c \u2018general principle of proportionality\u2019 \u201d and three-factor test was \u201csimply wrong\u201d and because there is no proportionality guarantee, <em>Solem </em>should be overruled. <em>(Harmelin, supra, </em>501 U.S. at pp. 962-965 [111 S.Ct. at pp. 2684-2686].) Four dissenting justices, again arguing from history, would have simply applied the <em>Solem </em>three-factor test to the case before them and found Harmelin\u2019s sentence did indeed violate the Eighth Amendment. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1027 [111 S.Ct. at pp. 2718-2719] (dis. opn. of White, J. [joined by Justices Blackmun and Stevens, with Justice Marshall agreeing also, while reiterating his view that the death penalty is always such a violation]).)</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">Justice Kennedy, writing for himself and Justices O\u2019Connor and Souter, steered a middle course between the two views set out above, arguing that \u201c[r]egardless of whether Justice Scalia or Justice White has the best of the historical argument . . . <em>stare decisis </em>counsels our adherence to the narrow proportionality principle that has existed in our Eighth Amendment jurisprudence for 80 years.\u201d <em>(Harmelin, supra, </em>501 U.S. at p. 996 [111 S.Ct. at p. 2702] (conc. opn. of Kennedy, J.).) Concluding that the initial question is simply whether a sentence \u201cis grossly disproportionate to a crime\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 1005 [111 S.Ct. at p. 2707]), and that only after that threshold is met is comparative analysis proper <em>(ibid.), </em>the three concurring justices identified \u201csome common principles that give content to the uses and limits of proportionality review.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 998 [111 S.Ct. at p. 2703].)</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">The \u201ccommon principles\u201d are four. First, setting prison terms for specific crimes involves substantive penological judgments within the province of legislatures rather than courts, and courts must give substantial deference to the broad authority legislatures have in setting punishment for crimes. <em>(Harmelin, supra, </em>501 U.S. at p. 998 [111 S.Ct. at p. 2703] (cone. opn. of Kennedy, J.).) Next, the Eighth Amendment does not compel any particular penological theory, and different criminal justice systems may give different <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>weight at different times to the goals of retribution, deterrence, incapacitation and rehabilitation. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 999 [111 S.Ct. at pp. 2703-2704].) Third, \u201cmarked divergences\u201d in sentencing and length of prison terms are an inevitable and often beneficial result of a federal structure; that a state has the most severe punishment for a particular crime does not alone render it grossly disproportionate. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1000 [111 S.Ct. at pp. 2704-2705].) Fourth, proportionality review should be by objective factors to the greatest extent possible, but courts lack \u201cclear objective standards to distinguish between sentences for different terms of years.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1001 [111 S.Ct. at p. 2704].)</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">While <em>Solem </em>held \u201cno single criterion can identify when a sentence is so grossly disproportionate that it violates the Eighth Amendment\u201d <em>(Solem, supra, </em>463 U.S. at p. 291, fn. 17 [103 S.Ct. at p. 3010]), <em>Harmelin </em>added that \u201c[o]n the other hand, one factor may be sufficient to determine the constitutionality of a particular sentence.\u201d <em>(Harmelin, supra, </em>501 U.S. at p. 1004 [111 S.Ct. at p. 2707] (conc. opn. of Kennedy, J.) In Harmelin\u2019s case, according to the concurring justices, the gravity of his crime alone was such that \u201ca comparison of his crime with his sentence does not give rise to an inference of gross disproportionality, and comparative analysis of his sentence . . . need not be performed.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1005 [111 S.Ct. at p. 2707].)</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">3. <em>Andrade and Brown</em></p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\"><em>In Andrade v. Attorney General of State of California </em>(9th Cir. 2001) 270 F.3d 743 <em>(Andrade)</em><footnotemark><em>14</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Mayle </em>(9th Cir. 2002) 283 F.3d 1019 <em>(Brown), </em>the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals found life terms cruel and unusual punishment when imposed on defendants convicted of petty theft with a prior theft conviction, having also been previously convicted of serious or violent felonies. (The facts in both the <em>Andrade </em>and <em>Brown </em>cases are distinguishable from the facts here, in that the defendants in <em>Andrade </em>and <em>Brown </em>were convicted of petty theft only while Mantanez was convicted in the present case of felony receiving stolen property as well as felony possession of heroin.)</p>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">With all due respect to our federal counterparts, in light of <em>Rummel, supra, </em>445 U.S. 263<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and <em>Harmelin, supra, </em>501 U.S. 957, we are not persuaded that it is cruel and unusual punishment to impose a possible life term on a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>conviction of a nonviolent felony committed by a defendant with a history of serious or violent felony convictions. In both <em>Andrade </em>and <em>Brown, </em>the court found the punishment cruel and unusual after determining there was an inference the sentence was \u201cgrossly disproportionate\u201d because the defendant was likely to spend the rest of his life in prison for shoplifting. <em>(Andrade, supra, </em>270 F.3d at p. 761.)</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">In <em>Andrade, </em>the appeals court recognized it should accord substantial deference to the legislative determinations of appropriate punishments, and as divergences in theories of sentencing and length of prison terms are inevitable in a federal system, proportionality reviews should be informed by objective factors. <em>(Andrade, supra, </em>270 F.3d at p. 757.) The <em>Andrade </em>court then subjectively determined that a life term was grossly disproportionate when imposed on a recidivist defendant convicted of petty theft with a prior theft conviction. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 761.) In doing so, the court overlooked the limitation on the court\u2019s role in the criminal process that it discussed earlier. In <em>Brown, supra, </em>283 F.3d 1019, the reviewing court merely adopted the initial \u201cgross disproportionality\u201d conclusion and subsequent confirming analysis arrived at in <em>Andrade.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">Because we must defer to the Legislature and the people of California (enacting the Three Strikes law through an initiative),<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> in adoption of a penological theory and in determination of the length of sentences, we cannot say when applying objective factors the term of 25 years to life <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>imposed on Mantanez is cruel and unusual punishment. The vice of the <em>Andrade!Brown </em>rationale, that California\u2019s punishment is the most or one of the most severe in the country supports an initial inference of \u201cgross disproportionality,\u201d is clear: for every offense, there necessarily is one or more of the states which punishes said offense most harshly. Under the <em>Andrade/Brown </em>rationale, federalism only extends to those within the extremes, and the extremes are automatically suspect.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">Further, the <em>Andrade </em>analysis sounds truly only jn a view of the present offense, unrelated to a history of serious felonies such as Andrade\u2019s burglaries,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> which vitiates the importance of punishing recidivism as a proper public goal. We think this rationale insufficient, and contrary to controlling United States Supreme Court jurisprudence.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">A further vice peculiar to <em>Brown </em>is the disregard of violence in earlier offenses as relevant to the question of whether the currently imposed punishment is or is not grossly disproportionate. Thus, while purporting to follow <em>Harmelin, Rummel </em>and <em>Solem, </em>the <em>Brown </em>court departed completely from the unique facts of <em>Solem </em>(where Helm was a person viewed by five justices as a drunk, rather than a criminal, without any background of violence, and thus one whose incarceration served no valid penological purpose under any theory)<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> to extend precisely the same relief to a hardened criminal with a great deal of violence in his background.  Cases are not authority for propositions not properly before them, and the application of the Eighth Amendment in cases such as Brown\u2019s does not \u201cclearly\u201d emerge from a consideration of <em>Solem </em>in the abstract, and seems far less clear when <em>Solem </em>is considered together with <em>Rummel </em>and <em>Harmelin, </em>proclaimed by the <em>Brown </em>court as \u201cgood law\u201d and then ignored in the analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>It is precisely because of Mantanez\u2019s past conduct, which has included forcible entries into homes where residents are present, numerous narcotics offenses, and long-term refusal to take any steps whatsoever to overcome his addiction despite several opportunities, that the trial judge determined Mantanez was indeed, in light of his continued participation in not only addictive but larcenous acts, wholly within, rather than without, the category of persons intended to be incarcerated for long terms under the Three Strikes legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">This punishment imposed in this case presents no \u201cexquisite rarity.\u201d Further, Mantanez\u2019s argument rests upon a fundamentally false premise, which another court has well discussed: \u201cAppellant contends his sentence of 25 years to life constitutes cruel or unusual (or both) punishment under the federal and state Constitutions. (U.S. Const., 8th Amend.; Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 17.) We find no constitutional infirmity. [fl] The basic fallacy of appellant\u2019s argument lies in his failure to acknowledge that he \u2018is not subject to a life sentence merely on the basis of his current offense but on the basis of his recidivist behavior. Recidivism in the commission of multiple felonies poses a manifest danger to society[,] justifying the imposition of longer sentences for subsequent offenses. [Citations.]\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v. Stone </em>(1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 707, 715 [89 Cal.Rptr.2d 401].)</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">In this case the trial court based its decision in large part on Mantanez\u2019s extensive criminal history. As of the time of the sentencing, Mantanez had accumulated numerous criminal convictions arising from a criminal career spanning 17 years. The probation report reflects at least 10 felony convictions and four separate prison terms before he committed his current felony offense. During his lengthy criminal history, Mantanez\u2019s grants of probation or parole were repeatedly violated. In short, the record demonstrates nearly four decades of criminal conduct, undeterred by repeated incarcerations and imprisonments. As such, it is clear that the sentence imposed was based not only on the nature of the current felony, but also on persistent recidivism demonstrated by this record.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">As the sentencing judge observed, the long criminal career of Mantanez properly brought him squarely within the Three Strikes ambit. If the statutorily prescribed penalty for recidivism cannot be applied to Mantanez, then there can hardly exist any case where its imposition would be proper, so long as any judicial officer were of the opinion it were improper. Such is not, should not be and cannot be the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">In these circumstances, whenever a putatively disproportionately harsh sentence is specified under the Three Strikes law, it is subject to judicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>modification at sentencing if the sentencing court deems it appropriate. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(Romero) (1996) 13 Cal.4th 497 [53 Cal.Rptr.2d 789, 917 P.2d 628].) This safety valve suffices for constitutional purposes; no greater and more informed wisdom concerning an offender\u2019s culpability is, as a matter of course, available to a reviewing court. According deference to the <em>Harmelin </em>principles, California\u2019s recidivist legislation is not violative of the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">As Justice Stewart observed in <em>Rummel, </em>repeating an earlier observation about recidivist legislation in Texas: \u201c \u2018If the Constitution gave me a roving commission to impose upon the criminal courts of Texas my own notions of enlightened policy, I would not join the Court\u2019s opinion. . . . But the question for decision is not whether we applaud or even whether we personally approve the procedures followed in [this case]. The question is whether those procedures fall below the minimum level the [Constitution] will tolerate.

HD In light of [appellant]\u2019s current offenses and extensive continued criminal conduct, we cannot say imposition of the functional equivalent of a life without possibility of parole sentence under the three strikes law either shocks the conscience or violates notions of human dignity.

As the majority admits, the trial court\u2019s decision may be affirmed using the analysis expressed in <em>Salem </em>v. <em>Helm </em>(1983) 463 U.S. 277 [103 S.Ct. 3001, 77 L.Ed.2d 637] and <em>In re Lynch </em>(1972) 8 Cal.3d 410 [105 Cal.Rptr. 217, 503 P.2d 921], which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>includes a consideration of defendant\u2019s recidivist background. I believe this analysis is sufficient to affirm the judgment. Therefore, I believe the majority\u2019s extended exposition of the interplay of the United States Supreme Court decisions in <em>Rummel </em>v. <em>Estelle </em>(1980) 445 U.S. 263 [100 S.Ct. 1133, 63 L.Ed.2d 382], <em>Solem v.

Michigan </em>(1991) 501 U.S. 957, 997 [111 S.Ct. 2680, 2702-2703, 115 L.Ed.2d 836] and the criticism of the two Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals cases <em>Andrade </em>v. <em>Attorney General of the State of California </em>(9th Cir. 2001) 270 F.3d 743 and <em>Brown v. Mayle </em>(9th Cir. 2002) 283 F.3d 1019 are unnecessary to the disposition here.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">As the majority concedes, both <em>Andrade </em>and <em>Brown </em>are distinguishable from our case in that the current crime involved there, petty theft, is ordinarily punished as a misdemeanor but is elevated to felony status only by reason of a prior theft conviction. In my view, this factual distinction makes the holdings of these cases inapplicable here. Further, although some of the language in <em>Andrade </em>and <em>Brown </em>suggests the Ninth Circuit may be inclined to invalidate some three strikes sentences where the current crime is not simply a misdemeanor elevated to felony status by prior conduct, it has not yet done so. Finally, the majority analysis is unnecessary in light of the fact that the Supreme Court has granted certiorari in <em>Andrade.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">Appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied July 17, 2002.
