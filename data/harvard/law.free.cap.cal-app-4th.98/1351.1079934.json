Plaintiffs contended that the fee was a \u201cproperty-related\u201d fee requiring voter approval, pursuant to California Constitution, article XIII D, section 6, subdivision (c), which was added by the passage of Proposition 218. The trial court ruled that the fee did not violate this provision because (1) it was not a property-related fee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1353\">*1353</page-number>and (2) it met the exemption for fees for sewer and water services. We disagree with the trial court\u2019s conclusion and therefore reverse the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-4\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-5\">In an effort to comply with the 1987 amendments to the federal Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251 et seq.; 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 122.26(a) et seq. (2001)), the Salinas City Council took measures to reduce or eliminate pollutants contained in storm water, which was channeled in a drainage system separate from the sanitary and industrial waste systems. On June 1,1999, the city council enacted two ordinances to fund and maintain the compliance program. These measures, ordinance Nos. 2350 and 2351, added former chapters 29 and 29A, respectively, to the Salinas City Code. Former section 29A-3 allowed the city council to adopt a resolution imposing a \u201cStorm Water Management Utility fee\u201d to finance the improvement of storm and surface water management facilities. The fee would be imposed on \u201cusers of the storm water drainage system.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-6\">On July 20, 1999, the city council adopted resolution No. 17019, which established rates for the storm and surface water management system. The resolution specifically states: \u201cThere is hereby imposed on each and every developed parcel of land within the City, and the owners and occupiers thereof, jointly and severally, a storm drainage fee.\u201d The fee was to be paid annually to the City \u201cby the owner or occupier of each and every developed parcel in the City who shall be presumed to be the primary utility rate payer . . . .\u201d The amount of the fee was to be calculated according to the degree to which the property contributed runoff to the City\u2019s drainage facilities. That contribution, in turn, would be measured by the amount of \u201cimpervious area\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> on that parcel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-7\">Undeveloped parcels\u2014those that had not been altered from their natural state\u2014were not subject to the storm drainage fee. In addition, developed parcels that maintained their own storm water management facilities or only partially contributed storm or surface water to the City\u2019s storm drainage facilities were required to pay in proportion to the amount they did contribute runoff or used the City\u2019s treatment services.</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1354\">*1354</page-number>On September 15, 1999, plaintiffs filed a complaint under Code of Civil Procedure section 863 to determine the validity of the fee.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Plaintiffs alleged that this was a property-related fee that violated article XIII D, section 6, subdivision (c), of the California Constitution because it had not been approved by a majority vote of the affected property owners or a two-thirds vote of the residents in the affected area. The trial court, however, found this provision to be inapplicable on two grounds: (1) the fee was not \u201cproperty related\u201d and (2) it was exempt from the voter-approval requirement because it was \u201crelated to\u201d sewer and water services.</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-4\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-5\">Article XIH D was added to the California Constitution in the November 1996 election with the passage of Proposition 218, the Right to Vote on Taxes Act. Section 6 of article XIII D<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> requires notice of a proposed property-related fee or charge and a public hearing. If a majority of the affected owners submit written protests, the fee may not be imposed. (\u00a7 6, subd. (a)(2).) The provision at issue is section 6, subdivision (c) (hereafter section 6(c)), which states, in relevant part: \u201cExcept for fees or charges for sewer, water, and refuse collection services, no property-related fee or charge shall be imposed or increased unless and until that fee or charge is submitted and approved by a majority vote of the property owners of the property subject to the fee or charge or, at the option of the agency, by a two-thirds vote of the electorate residing in the affected area.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-6\">Section 2 defines a \u201cfee\u201d under this article as a levy imposed \u201cupon a parcel or upon a person as an incident of property ownership, including a user fee or charge for a property-related service.\u201d (\u00a7 2, subd. (e).) A \u201cproperty-related service\u201d is \u201ca public service having a direct relationship to property ownership.\u201d (\u00a7 2, subd. (h).)  The City maintains that the storm drainage fee is not a property-related fee, but a \u201cuser fee\u201d which the property owner can avoid simply by maintaining a storm water management facility on the property. Because it is possible to own property without being subject to the fee, the City argues this is not a fee imposed \u201cas an incident of property ownership\u201d or \u201cfor a property-related service\u201d within the meaning of section 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-7\">We cannot agree with the City\u2019s position. Resolution No. 17019 plainly established a property-related fee for a property-related service, the management of storm water runoff from the \u201cimpervious\u201d areas of each parcel in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1355\">*1355</page-number>City. The resolution expressly stated that \u201ceach owner and occupier of a developed lot or parcel of real property within the City, is served by the City\u2019s storm drainage facilities\u201d and burdens the system to a greater extent than if the property were undeveloped. Those owners and occupiers of developed property \u201cshould therefore pay for the improvement, operation and maintenance of such facilities.\u201d Accordingly, the resolution makes the fee applicable to <em>\u201ceach and every developed parcel </em>of land within the City.\u201d (Italics added.) This is not a charge directly based on or measured by use, comparable to the metered use of water or the operation of a business, as the City suggests. (See <em>Apartment Assn, of Los Angeles County, Inc. </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(2001) 24 Cal.4th 830, 838 [102 Cal.Rptr.2d 719, 14 P.3d 930] [art. XIII D inapplicable to inspection fee imposed on private landlords; <em>Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Assn. </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(2000) 85 Cal.App.4th 79 [101 Cal.Rptr.2d 905] [water usage rates are not within the scope of art. XIII D].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-4\">The \u201cProportional Reduction\u201d clause on which the City relies does not alter the nature of the fee as property related.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> A property owner\u2019s operation of a private storm drain system reduces the amount owed to the City to the extent that runoff into the City\u2019s system is reduced. The fee nonetheless is a fee for a public service having a direct relationship to the ownership of developed property. The City\u2019s characterization of the proportional reduction as a simple \u201copt-out\u201d arrangement is misleading, as it suggests the property owner can avoid the fee altogether by declining the service. Furthermore, the reduction is not proportional to the amount of services requested or used by the occupant, but on the physical properties of the parcel. Thus, a parcel with a large \u201cimpervious area\u201d (driveway, patio, roof) would be charged more than one consisting of mostly rain-absorbing soil. Single-family residences are assumed to contain, on average, a certain amount of impervious area and are charged $18.66 based on that assumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-5\">Proposition 218 specifically stated that \u201c[t]he provisions of this act shall be liberally construed to effectuate its purposes of limiting local government revenue and enhancing taxpayer consent.\u201d (Prop. 218, \u00a7 5; reprinted at Historical Notes, 2A West\u2019s Ann. Cal.Const. (2002 supp.) foll. art. XIII C, p. 38 [hereafter Historical Notes].)  We are obligated to construe constitutional amendments in accordance with the natural and ordinary meaning of the language used by the framers\u2014in this case, the voters of California\u2014in a manner that effectuates their purpose in adopting the law. <em>(Amador Valley Joint Union High Sch. Dist. </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Equalization </em>(1978) 22 Cal.3d 208, 244-245 [149 Cal.Rptr. 239, 583 P.2d 1281]; <em>Arden Carmichael, Inc. v. County of Sacramento </em>(2000) 93 Cal.App.4th 507, 514-515 [113 Cal.Rptr.2d 248]; <em>Board of Supervisors v. Lonergan </em>(1980) 27 Cal.3d 855, 863 [167 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1356\">*1356</page-number>Cal.Rptr. 820, 616 P.2d 802].)  To interpret the storm drainage fee as a use-based charge would contravene one of the stated objectives of Proposition 218 by \u201cfrustrat[ing] the purposes of voter approval for tax increases.\u201d (Prop. 218, \u00a7 2.) We must conclude, therefore, that the storm drainage fee \u201cburden[s] landowners <em>as </em>landowners,\u201d and is therefore subject to the voter-approval requirements of article XHI D unless an exception applies. <em>(Apartment Assn. of Los Angeles County, Inc. v. City of Los Angeles, supra, </em>24 Cal.4th at p. 842.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-4\">\n<em>Exception for \u201cSewer\u201d or \u201cWater\u201d Service</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-5\">As an alternative ground for its decision, the trial court found that the storm drainage fee was \u201cclearly a fee related to \u2018sewer\u2019 and \u2018water\u2019 services.\u201d The exception in section 6(c) applies to fees \u201cfor sewer, water, and refuse collection services.\u201d Thus, the question we must next address is whether the storm drainage fee was a charge <em>for </em>sewer service or water service.</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-6\">The parties diverge in their views as to whether the reach of California Constitution, article XIIID, section 6(c) extends to a storm drainage system as well as a sanitary or industrial waste sewer system. The City urges that we rely on the \u201ccommonly accepted\u201d meaning of \u201csewer,\u201d noting the broad dictionary definition of this word.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The City also points to Public Utilities Code section 230.5 and the Salinas City Code, which describe storm drains as a type of sewer.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1094-7\">Plaintiffs \u201cdo not disagree that storm water is carried off in storm sewers,\u201d but they argue that we must look beyond mere definitions of \u201csewer\u201d to examine the legal meaning in context. Plaintiffs note that the storm water management system here is distinct from the sanitary sewer system and the industrial waste management system. Plaintiffs\u2019 position echoes that of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1357\">*1357</page-number>Attorney General, who observed that several California statutes differentiate between management of storm drainage and sewerage systems.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (81 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 104, 106 (1998).) Relying extensively on the Attorney General\u2019s opinion, plaintiffs urge application of a different rule of construction than the plain-meaning rule; they invoke the maxim that \u201cif a statute on a particular subject omits a particular provision, inclusion of that provision in another related statute indicates an intent [that] the provision is not applicable to the statute from which it was omitted.\u201d <em>(In re Marquis D. </em>(1995) 38 Cal.App.4th 1813, 1827 [46 Cal.Rptr.2d 198].) Thus, while section 5, which addresses assessment procedures, refers to exceptions specifically for <em>\u201csewers, </em>water, flood control, [and] <em>drainage </em>systems\u201d (italics added), the exceptions listed in section 6(c) pertain only to \u201csewer, water, and refuse collection services.\u201d Consequently, in plaintiffs\u2019 view, the voters must have intended to exclude drainage systems from the list of exceptions to the voter-approval requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-4\">The statutory construction principles invoked by both parties do not assist us. The maxim proffered by plaintiffs, \u201calthough useful at times, is no more than a rule of reasonable inference\u201d and cannot control over the lawmakers\u2019 intent. <em>(California Fed. Savings &amp; Loan Assn. v. City of Los Angeles </em>(1995) 11 Cal.4th 342, 350 [45 Cal.Rptr.2d 279, 902 P.2d 297]; <em>Murillo v. Fleet-wood Enterprises, Inc. </em>(1998) 17 Cal.4th 985, 991 [73 Cal.Rptr.2d 682, 953 P.2d 858].) On the other hand, invoking the plain-meaning rule only begs the question of whether the term \u201csewer services\u201d was intended to encompass the more specific sewerage with which most voters would be expected to be familiar, or all types of systems that use sewers, including storm drainage and industrial waste. The popular, nontechnical sense of sewer service, particularly when placed next to \u201cwater\u201d and \u201crefuse collection\u201d services, suggests the service familiar to most households and businesses, the sanitary sewerage system.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-5\">We conclude that the term \u201csewer services\u201d is ambiguous in the context of both section 6(c) and Proposition 218 as a whole. We must keep in mind, however, the voters\u2019 intent that the constitutional provision be construed liberally to curb the rise in \u201cexcessive\u201d taxes, assessments, and fees exacted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1358\">*1358</page-number>by local governments without taxpayer consent. (Prop. 218, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 5; reprinted at Historical Notes, <em>supra, </em>p. 38.) Accordingly, we are compelled to resort to the principle that exceptions to a general rule of an enactment must be strictly construed, thereby giving \u201csewer services\u201d its narrower, more common meaning applicable to sanitary sewerage.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (Cf. <em>Estate of Banerjee </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 527, 540 [147 Cal.Rptr. 157, 580 P.2d 657]; <em>City of Lafayette </em>v. <em>East Bay Mun. Utility Dist. </em>(1993) 16 Cal.App.4th 1005 [20 Cal.Rptr.2d 658].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-4\">The City itself treats storm drainage differently from its other sewer systems. The stated purpose of ordinance No. 2350 was to comply with federal law by reducing the amount of pollutants discharged into the storm water, and by preventing the discharge of \u201cnon-storm water\u201d into the storm drainage system, which channels storm water into state waterways. According to John Fair, the public works director, the City\u2019s storm drainage fee was to be used not just to provide drainage service to property owners, but to monitor and control pollutants that might enter the storm water before it is discharged into natural bodies of water.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Salinas City Code contains requirements addressed specifically to the management of storm water runoff.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> (See, e.g., Salinas City Code, \u00a7\u00a7 31-802.2, 29-15.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-5\">For similar reasons we cannot subscribe to the City\u2019s suggestion that the storm drainage fee is \u201cfor . . . water services.\u201d Government Code section 53750, enacted to explain some of the terms used in articles XHI C and XHI D, defines \u201c \u2018[w]ater\u2019 \u201d as \u201cany system of public improvements intended to provide for the production, storage, supply, treatment, or distribution of water.\u201d (Gov. Code, \u00a7 53750, subd. (m).) The average voter would envision \u201cwater service\u201d as the supply of water for personal, household, and commercial use, not a system or program that monitors storm water for pollutants, carries it away, and discharges it into the nearby creeks, river, and ocean.</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-6\">We conclude that article XHI D required the City to subject the proposed storm drainage fee to a vote by the property owners or the voting residents of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1359\">*1359</page-number>the affected area. The trial court therefore erred in ruling that ordinance Nos. 2350 and 2351 and Resolution No. 17019 were valid exercises of authority by the city council.</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-4\">\n<em>Disposition</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-5\">The judgment is reversed.
