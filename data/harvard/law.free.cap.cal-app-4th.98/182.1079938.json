Proulx &amp; Company (Proulx) appeals from a summary judgment entered in favor of J &amp; H Marsh &amp; McLennan of Utah, Inc. (J&amp;H). Proulx, a licensed contractor, sued J&amp;H, an insurance broker, for negligence, alleging that J&amp;H failed to add Proulx as an additional insured under comprehensive general liability insurance policies issued to Crest-Liners, Inc. (Crest-Liners), to whom Proulx subcontracted certain work. Proulx alleged that as a result of J&amp;H\u2019s failure to add Proulx as an additional insured, Proulx was damaged in connection with a claim made against it by Turner Construction Company (Turner) arising from Crest-Liners\u2019 work, which claim, Proulx alleged, would have been covered by the insurance if Proulx had been named as an additional insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-9\">In moving for summary judgment, J&amp;H contended that its failure to add Proulx as an additional insured did not cause Proulx any damage because (1) Turner\u2019s claim against Proulx would not have been covered by the policy at issue even if Proulx had been an additional insured, and (2) even if the claim had been covered, Proulx suffered no damage because it had received or waived the benefits that would have been available to it as an additional insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-10\">The trial court granted J&amp;H\u2019s summary judgment motion and entered judgment in favor of J&amp;H, finding that there was \u201cno genuine dispute that [Turner\u2019s] claim against Proulx was expressly and solely for breach of contract, and as such sought recovery for economic damages [which are not covered under the policy at issue] and not for property damages [which are covered under the policy].\u201d We hold that there is a triable issue of fact as to whether the insurance coverage that J&amp;H failed to obtain for Proulx could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>have covered Proulx\u2019s damages. There is evidence that some of the sums Turner sought to recover from Proulx were due to property damage covered under the policy, that the policy would have covered Proulx\u2019s alleged vicarious liability to Turner, and that Proulx\u2019s settlement of its claim against Crest-Liners does not bar Proulx\u2019s claims against J&amp;H. J&amp;H has not otherwise established that Proulx\u2019s claim is legally barred. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\">Background<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">\n<em>Installation and Attempted Repair of Tank Liner</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">Proulx subcontracted to furnish and install roofing and waterproofing on a 25-story commercial building being built on Figueroa Street in downtown Los Angeles. Turner was the general contractor on the building that was known as the 801 Tower Project. As part of its subcontract with Turner, Proulx was required to install a waterproof liner in a tank that was part of the building\u2019s air conditioning system. Because it did not have expertise in installing the kind of liner required under its contract with Turner, Proulx subcontracted the installation of the liner to Crest-Liners.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">Crest-Liners started its work on the tank liner in September 1991. The tank began to leak shortly after Crest-Liners installed the liner. Crest-Liners attempted to repair the leak, but more leaks occurred. At one point, the tank was leaking at a rate of 400 gallons of fluid per day.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">Over the next year, Crest-Liners, Proulx, and others made several attempts to identify the sources of the leaks and repair them. During several of those attempts the tank had to be emptied and there was damage to some of the cooling materials in the tank. While the repairs were being made, the air conditioning system could not run, and an expensive backup system was used to cool the building. The exact cause or causes of all of the leaks is unclear, although some of them may be attributable to Crest-Liners\u2019 work.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-9\">\n<em>Turner\u2019s Claim Against Proulx</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b169-10\">Turner met and exchanged correspondence with Proulx during the months in which the tank leaked. In memoranda of those meetings and in the correspondence, Turner noted (among other things) that the leaks had damaged certain pumps and valves, caused the waste of nearly half a million <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>gallons of water Turner had paid for, and prevented the use of the air conditioning and other systems.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">After more than a year in which Crest-Liners and Proulx were unable to repair the leaks, in January 1993 Turner demanded that Proulx remove and replace the liner. When Proulx failed to respond to Turner\u2019s demand, Turner declared Proulx in default of the subcontract between them. The building\u2019s owner subsequently contracted with another company to replace the liner. In October 1993, Turner itemized the costs associated with the leaky liner and calculated its \u201c[t]otal net claim against Proulx.\u201d The itemized list of costs included such items as \u201cPainting in office area,\u201d \u201cReplace DP transmitter in valve pit,\u201d \u201cRepair office area,\u201d and \u201cPatch Drywall,\u201d in addition to costs associated with replacing the defective waterproof liner. Turner\u2019s claim came to just over $300,000. Proulx entered into a settlement with Turner, but the form and amount of the settlement are not disclosed in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">\n<em>Proulx\u2019s Lack of Expected Coverage Under Crest-Liners\u2019 Insurance Policies</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">The subcontract between Proulx and Crest-Liners required Crest-Liners to \u201cmaintain in full force and effect ... a comprehensive liability insurance policy\u201d and to \u201cfurnish certificates of insurance to [Proulx] before commencing work.\u201d The subcontract also required Crest-Liners to indemnify and hold Proulx harmless against all claims, demands, and liability for damages arising out of or connected with Crest-Liners\u2019 activities and performance of its work installing the waterproof liner.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">Several weeks after executing the subcontract, Proulx sent a \u201cletter of transmittal\u201d to Crest-Liners, asking Crest-Liners to forward to Proulx the certificate of insurance and to list Proulx as an additional insured. Crest-Liners contacted its insurance broker, J&amp;H, and asked it to add Proulx as an additional insured under Crest-Liners\u2019 general liability policy with National Union Fire Insurance Company (National Union).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-9\">J&amp;H issued a certificate of insurance that listed Proulx as such an additional insured, and the certificate was forwarded to Proulx. The J&amp;H agent who signed the certificate of insurance believed at the time she issued the certificate that insurance coverage was automatically extended to the additional insured when the certificate of insurance was sent to National Union. As it turns out, her belief was incorrect. She later learned that National Union would extend coverage only if J&amp;H made a specific request to a specific underwriter. Because the J&amp;H agent had not made such a request, coverage under Crest-Liners\u2019 policy was not extended to Proulx.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>Proulx was not aware that it had not been added to Crest-Liners\u2019 policy as an additional insured. On October 1, 1992, Proulx asked Crest-Liners to inform National Union \u201cof the Glycol Tank leak situation.\u201d Crest-Liners did so on October 5, 1992. On January 8, 1993, Proulx\u2019s attorney sent a letter to American International Adjusting Group, stating that Proulx was named as an additional insured under Crest-Liners\u2019 policy with National Union and demanding that National Union resolve the claim made against Proulx by Turner. National Union denied coverage on the ground that Proulx was never added to any of Crest-Liners\u2019 policies as an additional insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\">\n<em>Proulx\u2019s Attempt to Recover Its Alleged Damages</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">Proulx filed the original complaint in this action in November 1994, alleging several claims against Crest-Liners arising from its defective work and its representations regarding its qualifications, and two claims against National Union for breach of insurance contract and bad faith. The court dismissed the claims against National Union on demurrer because Proulx was not an insured under the National Union policies. National Union provided a defense to Crest-Liners in connection with Proulx\u2019s lawsuit against Crest-Liners, and paid Proulx $210,000 to settle Proulx\u2019s claims against Crest-Liners. At some point (the record is unclear), Proulx amended its complaint to allege a claim for negligence against J&amp;H.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">\n<em>J&amp;H\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">J&amp;H moved for summary judgment. In its moving papers, J&amp;H challenged only the causation and damages elements of Proulx\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">J&amp;H argued that its failure to add Proulx as an additional insured under Crest-Liners\u2019 policy did not cause Proulx\u2019s alleged damages because Crest-Liners\u2019 policy would not have covered Turner\u2019s claim against Proulx, even if Proulx had been an additional insured, for three reasons: (1) the policy obligated the insurer to defend and indemnify only if a lawsuit was filed against the insured, and Turner had not filed a lawsuit; (2) the policy only covered \u201cbodily injury\u201d or \u201cproperty damage\u201d caused by an \u201coccurrence\u201d as those terms are defined in the policy, and Turner\u2019s claim was for economic loss for breach of contract, which claim is not covered; and (3) the policy prohibited an insured from voluntarily making a payment or settling a claim without the insurer\u2019s consent, and Proulx had voluntarily made payments to or settled with Turner.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-9\">J&amp;H argued that Proulx was not entitled to any damages as a result of J&amp;H\u2019s failure to add Proulx as an additional insured because (1) the contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>between Proulx and Crest-Liners, which contract Proulx alleged gave rise to J&amp;H\u2019s duty to add Proulx as an additional insured, required only that Crest-Liners indemnify Proulx for vicarious liability Proulx incurred as a result of Crest-Liners\u2019 negligence, whereas Turner\u2019s claim against Proulx was for Proulx\u2019s active negligence; and (2) Proulx settled the lawsuit it brought against Crest-Liners for Crest-Liners\u2019 negligence and dismissed its causes of action with prejudice, which dismissal bars further litigation on the same subject matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">J&amp;H\u2019s separate statement of undisputed material facts was divided into four sections: \u201cBackground Facts,\u201d \u201cFacts About Insurance Coverages,\u201d \u201cConstruction Contracts,\u201d and \u201cSettlement Operates As <em>Retraxit.\u201d </em>All of the facts in the \u201cFacts About Insurance Coverages\u201d section related to either whether Turner\u2019s claim against Proulx came within the insuring agreement portion of the National Union policies (i.e., whether the claim was \u201cbodily injury\u201d or \u201cproperty damage\u201d caused by an \u201coccurrence\u201d) or the timing of Proulx\u2019s notice to National Union about Turner\u2019s claim. None of the facts related to the applicability of any of the exclusions in the policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">The evidence submitted in support of J&amp;H\u2019s motion included memoranda and correspondence in which Turner appears to assert that the leaks in the tank liner caused damage to property other than the tank itself and prevented the use of the air conditioning system as well as other systems in the building. J&amp;H also submitted the declaration of a purported insurance coverage expert, who testified that no comprehensive general liability policies issued by National Union to parties working in the construction business during the past 16 years would have provided coverage for the kind of claim Turner alleged against Proulx.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">\n<em>Proulx\u2019s Opposition</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">In opposing J&amp;H\u2019s motion, Proulx contended that (1) the absence of a lawsuit by Turner against Proulx was not dispositive because J&amp;H\u2019s negligence deprived Proulx of coverage and therefore Proulx was in the same position as an insured whose insurer wrongfully denies coverage, i.e., it was empowered to deal with a claimant on its own before a lawsuit was filed; (2) Turner\u2019s claim was at least in part based upon property damage as defined in Crest-Liners\u2019 policies, caused by Crest-Liners\u2019 defective work; (3) Proulx\u2019s attempts to mitigate the damage being caused by the leaking tank did not vitiate coverage under the Crest-Liners policies because they were not \u201cvoluntarily\u201d incurred and they did not prejudice National Union; (4) regardless of the terms of the written contract between Crest-Liners and Proulx, Crest-Liners attempted to add Proulx as an additional insured under its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>policies with National Union and J&amp;H represented that it had accomplished it; and (5) Proulx\u2019s settlement with Crest-Liners did not bar its claim against J&amp;H because the settlement covered only the harm caused by Crest-Liners\u2019 independent acts of negligence rather than the harm caused by J&amp;H\u2019s negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\">Proulx submitted evidence that (1) it had demanded that Proulx be added as an additional insured under Crest-Liners\u2019 policies, and believed that it had been so added; (2) Turner\u2019s claim against Proulx was based upon Crest-Liners\u2019 active negligence; (3) it notified Crest-Liners, National Union, and J&amp;H that Proulx sought coverage under Crest-Liners\u2019 policies and National Union denied coverage; and that (4) it took corrective action and incurred expenses (both before and after National Union was notified of the claim and denied coverage) in an effort to mitigate its damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">\n<em>J&amp;H\u2019s Reply</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">In reply to Proulx\u2019s opposition, J&amp;H submitted an additional declaration of its insurance expert regarding the scope of coverage under certain policy endorsements. J&amp;H also submitted portions of the deposition of Turner\u2019s \u201cperson most knowledgeable\u201d witness, who testified that the document summarizing Turner\u2019s claim against Proulx did not include \u201ccosts for damages that we commonly term ripple beyond the glycol and fire tank itself.\u201d He did not, however, explain exactly what \u201cripple\u201d damages include or exclude. He also stated that the summary of Turner\u2019s claim did not include any costs that Proulx or Crest-Liners had already incurred to repair the leaking tank.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">\n<em>The Hearing and Supplemental Briefs</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b173-8\">At the hearing on J&amp;H\u2019s motion, the trial court issued a written tentative ruling. In summarizing its tentative ruling at the hearing, the court explained that the National Union policy would not have provided coverage because Turner\u2019s claim was based upon the contract between Turner and Proulx, and because certain exclusions\u2014(b) (assumption of liability by contract), (j)(6) (restoration or repair of property on which insured performed work), (m)(l) (defect in insured\u2019s work causing damage to \u201cimpaired property\u201d), and (m)(2) (delay or failure to perform obligation)\u2014would preclude coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-9\">Proulx filed a supplemental brief regarding the effect of the policy exclusions the trial court raised, asserting that there were fact questions regarding the applicability of the exclusions. J&amp;H replied to Proulx\u2019s supplemental brief and asserted that each of the exclusions apply and preclude coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>\n<em>The Trial Court\u2019s Ruling</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">The trial court granted J&amp;H\u2019s motion on the ground that \u201c[Turner\u2019s] claim against Proulx was expressly and solely for breach of contract, and as such sought recovery for economic damages and not for property damages.\u201d The court stated that the itemized claim that Turner prepared, which both J&amp;H and Proulx submitted in support of and opposition to the motion, \u201cmay constitute evidence that there was property damage attributable to the leaking liner,\u201d but the court concluded that summary judgment was appropriate because the inclusion of those items did not \u201cindicate that [Turner] was asserting a claim for the property damage rather than the economic loss associated with repairing the damage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">A. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">On appeal from a summary judgment, we make \u201can independent assessment of the correctness of the trial court\u2019s ruling, applying the same legal standard as the trial court in determining whether there are any genuine issues of material fact or whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>(Iverson </em>v. <em>Muroc Unified School Dist. </em>(1995) 32 Cal.App.4th 218, 222 [38 Cal.Rptr.2d 35].)</p>\n<p id=\"b174-8\">\u201c[F]rom commencement to conclusion, the party moving for summary judgment bears the burden of persuasion that there is no triable issue of material fact and that he is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. ... A defendant [moving for summary judgment] bears the burden of persuasion that \u2018one or more elements of the \u2018cause of action\u2019 in question \u2018cannot be established,\u2019 or that \u2018there is a complete defense\u2019 thereto.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 850 [107 Cal.Rptr.2d 841, 24 P.3d 493] <em>(Aguilar), </em>italics and fns. omitted.) In addition, \u201cthe party moving for summary judgment bears an initial burden of production to make a prima facie showing of the nonexistence of any triable issue of material fact.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>If, and only if, the moving party carries that burden, the burden of production shifts to the opposing party to make a prima facie showing of the existence of a triable issue of material fact. <em>(Ibid.) </em>\u201cA prima facie showing is one that is sufficient to support the position of the party in question. [Citation.] No more is called for.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 851.)</p>\n<p id=\"b174-9\">Although \u201c[t]he purpose of the law of summary judgment is to provide courts with a mechanism to cut through the parties\u2019 pleadings in order to determine whether, despite their allegations, trial is in fact necessary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>to resolve their dispute\u201d <em>(Aguilar, supra, </em>25 Cal.4th at p. 843), our Supreme Court has warned that the summary judgment \u201cprocedure is drastic and should be used with caution in order that it may not become a substitute for existing methods in the determination of issues of fact\u201d <em>(Eagle Oil &amp; Ref. Co. v. Prentice </em>(1942) 19 Cal.2d 553, 556 [122 P.2d 264]). Accordingly, declarations of the moving party are strictly construed, those of the opposing party are liberally construed, and doubts as to whether a summary judgment should be granted must be resolved in favor of the opposing party. The court focuses on issue finding; it does not resolve issues of fact. The court seeks to find contradictions in the evidence, or inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence, that raise a triable issue of material fact. <em>(Michael J. </em>v. <em>Los Angeles County Dept. of Adoptions </em>(1988) 201 Cal.App.3d 859, 865-866 [247 Cal.Rptr. 504].)</p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\">If, in deciding this appeal, we find there is no issue of material fact, we affirm the summary judgment if it is correct on any legal ground applicable to this case, whether that ground was the legal theory adopted by the trial court or not. <em>(Western Mutual Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Yamamoto </em>(1994) 29 Cal.App.4th 1474,1481 [35 Cal.Rptr.2d 698].) If, on the other hand, we find that one or more triable issues of material fact exist, then we must reverse the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">B. <em>Proulx\u2019s Professional Negligence Claim Requires Proulx to Show That Crest-Liners\u2019 Policies Would Have Covered Turner\u2019s Claim</em></p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">Proulx\u2019s cause of action against J&amp;H, a professional negligence claim, is similar to a legal malpractice claim, in that liability must be established in a case-within-a-case. Just as a plaintiff in a legal malpractice case must establish that it would have prevailed in the underlying action but for the defendant\u2019s professional negligence, Proulx can recover on its cause of action against J&amp;H only if it can show that, but for J&amp;H\u2019s negligence, Proulx would have had at least some coverage for Turner\u2019s claim under the National Union policies. Without such a showing, there is no cause of action because there are no damages caused by the breach of the professional\u2019s duty. (See, e.g., <em>Budd v. Nixen </em>(1971) 6 Cal.3d 195, 200 [98 Cal.Rptr. 849, 491 P.2d 433] [\u201cThe mere breach of a professional duty, causing only nominal damages, speculative harm, or the threat of future harm\u2014not yet realized\u2014does not suffice to create a cause of action for negligence\u201d]; see also <em>Walker v. Pacific Indemnity Co. </em>(1960) 183 Cal.App.2d 513, 516-517 [6 Cal.Rptr. 924] [cause of action against insurance agent for negligently procuring insurance in amount less than ordered by insured did not accrue until judgment was entered against insured for more than coverage amount, unless insured could show special facts to establish other injury, such as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>adverse credit rating based upon mere existence of unindemnified liability].) Thus, in addressing the causation element of Proulx\u2019s negligence claim in J&amp;H\u2019s motion for summary judgment, J&amp;H attempted to establish that Crest-Liners\u2019 policies would not have provided coverage to Proulx for Turner\u2019s claim if Proulx had been an additional insured under those policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">C. <em>There Was a Triable Issue Regarding Whether Turner\u2019s Claim Against Proulx Was for \u201cProperty Damage\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">Proulx contends that there was evidence of property damage caused by Crest-Liners\u2019 work and that this evidence raises a triable issue because, regardless of Turner\u2019s legal theory for recovery (breach of contract or tort), the damages Turner sought were \u201cbecause of\u2019 property damage, as required for coverage under Crest-Liners\u2019 insurance policies. Crest-Liners\u2019 policies provided that National Union would \u201cpay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of . . . \u2018property damage\u2019 to which this insurance applies.\u201d \u201cProperty damage\u201d is defined as \u201ca. Physical injury to tangible property, including all resulting loss of use of that property; or [f] b. loss of use of tangible property that is not physically injured.\u201d To be covered under a commercial general liability (CGL) policy, such as the policy in this case, the \u201cproperty damage\u201d must be to tangible property other than the insured\u2019s own work, caused by the insured\u2019s defective work. (See, e.g., <em>Maryland Casualty Co. v. Reeder </em>(1990) 221 Cal.App.3d 961, 967 [270 Cal.Rptr. 719].)</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">The \u201cfocus [should be] on the nature of the risk and the injury, in light of the policy provisions,\u201d rather than on the form of action chosen by the injured party, when determining whether a claim is covered. <em>(Vandenberg </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 815, 839-840 [88 Cal.Rptr.2d 366, 982 P.2d 229] <em>(Vandenberg).) </em>In <em>AIU Ins. Co. v. Superior Court </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 807 [274 Cal.Rptr. 820, 799 P.2d 1253] <em>(AIU), </em>the Supreme Court examined whether there is coverage under a CGL policy for an insured who, as a result of an injunctive relief action filed against it, may become obligated to pay for cleanup or other response costs related to the insured\u2019s release of hazardous materials into the environment. Looking at the \u201cbecause of\u2019 \u201cproperty damage\u201d language of the CGL policy, the Supreme Court said that when government agencies seek to recover from an insured the reimbursement of the agencies\u2019 response costs, \u201cin plain and ordinary terms such recovery is \u2018because of\u2019 property damage. It is immaterial whether motivations other than protection of property\u2014for example, protection of the health of persons living near hazardous waste sites\u2014also contribute to the agencies\u2019 pursuit of statutory relief. . . . Whatever their dominant motive, the event precipitating their legal action [to require the insured to pay to clean <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>up the hazardous material or to reimburse the agencies for their cleanup costs] is contamination of property. The costs that result from such action are therefore incurred \u2018because of property damage.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 842-843.)</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">In light of <em>Vandenberg </em>and <em>AIU, </em>the issue here is whether at least some of the damages Turner sought to recover were \u201cbecause of\u2019 \u201cproperty damage\u201d as those terms are used in the insurance policies at issue, regardless of whether Turner sought those damages under a contract theory or a tort theory. In moving for summary judgment, J&amp;H submitted (among other things) a document that <em>on its face </em>suggests that at least some of the damages Turner sought to recover from Proulx were \u201cbecause of\u2019 \u201cproperty damage.\u201d That document, a summary of Turner\u2019s claim against Proulx, lists costs associated with repairing damage to property other than the liner Crest-Liners installed in the glycol tank, which damages apparently were caused by the leaking liner. In addition, J&amp;H submitted other documents in which reference is made to damage to other property, which damage also was caused by the leaking liner. This evidence suggests that the leaking liner caused \u201cphysical injury\u201d to \u201ctangible property\u201d other than the liner itself, for which Turner sought reimbursement (albeit, under a breach of contract theory). Thus, J&amp;H\u2019s own evidence raises a triable issue regarding whether Turner\u2019s claim was for damages \u201cbecause of\u2019 \u201cproperty damage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">Because the references to damage to such property as the \u201coffice area\u201d are sufficient to raise a triable issue, we do not need to resolve at this stage of the case whether damage to other items would be covered by the policies. Also, we do not need to determine whether, as Proulx contends, the cost to remove the leaking liner is recoverable under Crest-Liners\u2019 policies, either because the liner was incorporated into other property (as in <em>Shade Foods, Inc. v. Innovative Products Sales &amp; Marketing, Inc. </em>(2000) 78 Cal.App.4th 847 [93 Cal.Rptr.2d 364] and <em>Armstrong World Industries, Inc. </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co. </em>(1996) 45 Cal.App.4th 1 [52 Cal.Rptr.2d 690]) or because removal was a remedial action (as in <em>AIU, supra, </em>51 Cal.3d 807). Because J&amp;H failed to meet its burden of production to establish that Turner\u2019s claim against Proulx did not seek to recover for at least some \u201cphysical injury\u201d to property other than the liner (i.e., damages \u201cbecause of\u2019 \u201cproperty damage\u201d), J&amp;H is not entitled to summary judgment on the ground that there was no alleged \u201cproperty damage.\u201d <em>(Aguilar, supra, </em>25 Cal.4th at p. 850.)</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">D. <em>None of the Grounds J&amp;H Raised in the Trial Court Justify Summary Judgment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b177-8\">In determining whether summary judgment is appropriate on any other ground supported by J&amp;H\u2019s separate statement of undisputed facts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number><em>(Western Mutual Ins. Co. v. Yamamoto, supra, </em>29 Cal.App.4th at p. 1481), we limit our review to grounds supported by the separate statement because only those facts set forth in the separate statement are relevant when determining whether summary judgment should be granted. (See, e.g., <em>United Community Church v. Garcin </em>(1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 327, 337 [282 Cal.Rptr. 368] [\u201c[A]ll material facts must be set forth in the separate statement. \u2018This is the Golden Rule of Summary Adjudication: if it is not set forth in the separate statement, it does not exist. Both the court and the opposing party are entitled to have all the facts upon which the moving party bases its motion plainly set forth in the separate statement.\u2019 \u201d (italics omitted)].)</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">J&amp;H raised four other grounds for summary judgment in its moving papers: (1) there would not have been any coverage under the policy because Turner did not file a lawsuit against Proulx, (2) there would not have been any coverage because Proulx voluntarily made payments to Turner, (3) when Proulx sued Crest-Liners it received all of the benefits it would have received from the indemnity required under the contract between Proulx and Crest-Liners, and (4) Proulx\u2019s dismissal of its lawsuit against Crest-Liners operates as a retraxit barring the instant lawsuit. In addition to these grounds, J&amp;H in its supplemental brief in support of its summary judgment motion raised certain exclusions in the Crest-Liners insurance policies that J&amp;H contended would have barred coverage of Turner\u2019s claim against Proulx. None of these grounds warrants summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">1. <em>No \u201csuif\u2019</em></p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">J&amp;H points to Turner\u2019s failure to file a lawsuit against Proulx to recover the damages Turner incurred as a result of the leaking liner and contends that, because an insurer has discretion to investigate and settle a \u201cclaim\u201d and is required to defend only a \u201csuit\u201d under a CGL policy <em>(Foster-Gardner, Inc. v. National Union Fire Ins. Co. </em>(1998) 18 Cal.4th 857, 878 [77 Cal.Rptr.2d 107, 959 P.2d 265]), Proulx cannot establish that National Union would have covered Turner\u2019s claim even if J&amp;H had not failed to add Proulx as an additional insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">J&amp;H\u2019s failure to add Proulx as an additional insured is analogous to an insurer\u2019s wrongful denial of coverage. Courts have held that an insurer waives defenses of noncompliance with policy provisions when it wrongfully denies coverage. (See, e.g., <em>Samson v. Transamerica Ins. Co. </em>(1981) 30 Cal.3d 220, 238 [178 Cal.Rptr. 343, 636 P.2d 32] and <em>Downey Savings &amp; Loan Assn. v. Ohio Casualty Ins. Co. </em>(1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 1072, 1088 [234 Cal.Rptr. 835].) Just as an insurer cannot assert a \u201cno suit\u201d defense if it has wrongfully repudiated its policy, J&amp;H cannot assert that defense when it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>negligently failed to obtain coverage for Proulx under Crest-Liners\u2019 policy.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Having been left without any insurance coverage as a result of J&amp;H\u2019s alleged negligence, Proulx was not required to force Turner to file a lawsuit against it so it could later argue that National Union would have been obligated to defend it had J&amp;H obtained the desired insurance coverage. J&amp;H also argues that, because Turner did not file a lawsuit, Proulx can only speculate regarding what claims Turner might have alleged, and therefore Proulx cannot show that the National Union policy would have covered its damages. As discussed above, Proulx was not required to force Turner to file a lawsuit in order to recover for J&amp;H\u2019s alleged negligence. Proulx submitted sufficient evidence from which a trier of fact may determine the type and scope of damages Turner sought to (and apparently did) recover from Proulx. The trier of fact could reasonably conclude that Turner would have alleged those damages had it been forced to file a lawsuit against Proulx. At trial, Proulx may seek to recover from J&amp;H those damages that would have been covered under the National Union policy. (See <em>Clemente </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1985) 40 Cal.3d 202, 219 [219 Cal.Rptr. 445, 707 P.2d 818] [holding that plaintiff is entitled to recover damages despite inability to prove damages with certainty when that inability is due to defendant\u2019s actions].)</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">Accordingly, summary judgment cannot be granted on the ground that Turner did not file a lawsuit against Proulx.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">2. \u201cVoluntary\u201d <em>payment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">Crest-Liners\u2019 policy with National Union provided: \u201cNo insureds will, except at their own cost, voluntarily make a payment, assume any obligation, or incur any expense, other than for first aid, without our consent.\u201d J&amp;H presented evidence that Proulx (including its subcontractor Crest-Liners) began to make repairs to the leaking liner, in response to Turner\u2019s notification of the leaks, before Proulx notified National Union of Turner\u2019s claim. J&amp;H contends that, because of these repairs, Proulx breached the no voluntary payment provision, which breach would have precluded coverage for payments made before National Union was notified. (Citing <em>Jamestown Builders, Inc. v. General Star Indemnity Co. </em>(1999) 77 Cal.App.4th 341, 343-344 [91 Cal.Rptr.2d 514]; <em>Truck Ins. Exchange v. Unigard Ins. Co. </em>(2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 966, 976-977 [94 Cal.Rptr.2d 516].)</p>\n<p id=\"b180-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>Proulx argues there was no breach because its payments were not \u201cvoluntary,\u201d relying on <em>Fiorito v. Superior Court </em>(1990) 226 Cal.App.3d 433 [277 Cal.Rptr. 27] and <em>Shell Oil Co. v. National Union Fire Ins. Co. </em>(1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 1633 [52 Cal.Rptr.2d 580]. In addition, Proulx contends that summary judgment is not appropriate because coverage cannot be denied unless the insurer proves it was prejudiced by the \u201cvoluntary\u201d payments, and J&amp;H failed to present evidence that National Union would have been prejudiced.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">We do not need to decide whether Proulx\u2019s payments were \u201cvoluntary\u201d because J&amp;H\u2019s argument was addressed to only those payments made <em>before </em>Proulx gave notice to National Union. Proulx submitted evidence that at least some of the payments were made <em>after </em>notice was given and National Union denied coverage. Thus, even if J&amp;H were correct that the payments Proulx made before it gave notice to National Union were not recoverable (an issue we need not decide), those prenotice payments would not constitute a breach of the insurance policies that would preclude coverage of <em>all </em>of Proulx\u2019s payments, including the postnotice payments. To establish that the postnotice payments would not have been covered, J&amp;H would have to show that National Union would have been prejudiced by those postnotice payments. (See <em>Xebec Development Partners, Ltd. v. National Union Fire Ins. Co. </em>(1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 501, 532-533, 566-567 [15 Cal.Rptr.2d 726].) Because J&amp;H did not produce any evidence of such hypothetical prejudice to National Union, summary judgment cannot be granted on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">3. <em>Contract between Proulx and Crest-Liners</em></p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">In its motion, J&amp;H argued that Proulx was not damaged by J&amp;H\u2019s failure to add Proulx as an additional insured because the contract between Proulx and Crest-Liners did not require Crest-Liners to \u201cpurchase general liability coverage for Proulx.\u201d J&amp;H contended that Crest-Liners was obligated only to indemnify Proulx for damages resulting from <em>Crest-Liners\u2019 </em>active or passive negligence. Because Turner\u2019s claim against Proulx was, according to J&amp;H, based upon <em>Proulx\u2019s </em>active negligence, Proulx was not entitled to indemnification. Therefore, J&amp;H argued, Proulx received all of the benefits to which it was entitled under the Proulx/Crest-Liners contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">J&amp;H misconstrues Proulx\u2019s cause of action. While it appears that Proulx did, in fact, misstate the terms of the Proulx/Crest-Liners contract regarding whether Crest-Liners was obligated to procure insurance coverage for Proulx, those allegations are not dispositive of Proulx\u2019s negligence claim against J&amp;H.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">Proulx\u2019s claim against J&amp;H was not based upon a duty arising from the Proulx/Crest-Liners contract. It was based upon J&amp;H\u2019s voluntarily assumed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>undertaking to procure insurance coverage for Proulx under Crest-Liners\u2019 policies. (See, e.g., <em>Valdez </em>v. <em>Taylor Automobile Co. </em>(1954) 129 Cal.App.2d 810, 817-818 [278 P.2d 91] [finding defendant owed plaintiff duty to procure insurance when defendant told plaintiff that it would do so]; accord, <em>Aim Insurance Co. v. Culasi </em>(1991) 229 Cal.App.3d 209, 215-216 [280 Cal.Rptr. 766].) Therefore, J&amp;H\u2019s evidence regarding the terms of the Proulx/Crest-Liners contract, even though undisputed, does not entitle J&amp;H to summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\">4. <em>Retraxit</em></p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">As an additional ground for granting summary judgment, J&amp;H contends that Proulx\u2019s settlement with Crest-Liners, resulting in a dismissal with prejudice in favor of Crest-Liners, operated as a retraxit that bars Proulx\u2019s cause of action against J&amp;H. A retraxit is equivalent to a judgment on the merits and as such bars further litigation on the same causes of action between the same parties. <em>(Rodriguez </em>v. <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co. </em>(1983) 142 Cal.App.3d 46, 54 [190 Cal.Rptr. 705], disapproved on another point in <em>Moradi-Shalal v. Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Companies </em>(1988) 46 Cal.3d 287 [250 Cal.Rptr. 116, 758 P.2d 58]; see also 6 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (4th ed. 1997) Proceedings Without Trial, \u00a7 273, pp. 692-693; <em>id. </em>(2001 supp.) \u00a7 273, pp. 127-129.) Even if a retraxit can arise from a dismissal when there is some privity between the parties and some similarity of issues warranting issue preclusion, here J&amp;H presented no facts in its separate statement in support of its motion for summary judgment to show either (1) that Crest-Liners and J&amp;H should be treated as the same parties for the purpose of determining whether there was a retraxit or (2) that the resolution of issues as between Proulx and Crest-Liners would preclude the adjudication of issues in the case between Proulx and J&amp;H. Without facts set forth in a separate statement to support a ground for summary judgment, summary judgment cannot be granted on that ground. <em>(United Community Church v. Garcin, </em>supra, 231 Cal.App.3d at p. 337.) Accordingly, J&amp;H did not establish a retraxit for the purposes of summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">5. <em>Policy exclusions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">In the trial court, J&amp;H contended that four exclusions under the National Union policies would have precluded coverage of Turner\u2019s claim against Proulx. On appeal, J&amp;H contends that those exclusions (as well as one other, discussed in pt. E, <em>post) </em>entitled J&amp;H to summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">In its moving papers before the trial court, J&amp;H included a passing reference to only one exclusion under the National Union policies: exclusion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>(b), which excluded coverage for \u201c \u2018property damage [for] which the insured is obligated to pay damages by reason of the assumption of liability in a contract or agreement.\u2019 \u201d J&amp;H argues on appeal that this exclusion precludes coverage of Turner\u2019s claim against Proulx because Proulx is obligated to pay Turner\u2019s damages solely because Proulx assumed liability in its contract with Turner.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">Exclusion (b) is a \u201ccontractual exclusion clause\u201d that precludes coverage \u201conly in situations where the insured would not be liable to a third party except for the fact that [the insured] assumed liability under an express agreement with [that third] party.\u201d (Annot., Scope and Effect of Clause in Liability Policy Excluding From Coverage Liability Assumed by Insured Under Contract Not Defined in Policy, Such as One of Indemnity (1959) 63 A.L.R.2d 1122, 1123.) This exclusion would preclude coverage only if in the absence of a contractual indemnity provision, Proulx would not have been liable to Turner.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">The evidence presented to the trial court demonstrates a triable issue of fact regarding whether Proulx\u2019s liability to Turner derived only from the contractual indemnity provision. The document summarizing Turner\u2019s claim against Proulx suggests that Turner incurred expenses repairing the damage caused by Crest-Liners\u2019 negligence, which expenses Turner sought to recover from Proulx. Because Proulx was vicariously liable for Crest-Liners\u2019 negligent installation of the liner (see <em>Dow v. Holly Manufacturing Co. </em>(1958) 49 Cal.2d 720, 727 [321 P.2d 736] [contractor liable for negligence of subcontractor]), which liability did not arise solely from a contractual indemnity provision, Turner might have recovered in tort <em>or </em>contract. Thus, summary judgment cannot be granted based upon the applicability of exclusion (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">Summary judgment also cannot be granted based upon the applicability of the exclusions J&amp;H raised in its supplemental brief in support of its motion. J&amp;H filed its supplemental brief after the hearing on its motion, in response to the trial court\u2019s tentative ruling and the court\u2019s statement that other exclusions might preclude coverage. In its brief, J&amp;H argued that these three other exclusions also would have applied to deny coverage: exclusions (j)(5), (m)(l), and (m)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">Exclusion (j)(5) excluded coverage for \u201cproperty damage\u201d to \u201c[t]hat particular part of real property on which [the insured] . . . [is] performing operations if the \u2018property damage\u2019 arises out of those operations.\u201d This exclusion cannot be the basis for summary judgment because J&amp;H failed to produce evidence to show that the exclusion applied, i.e., that all of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>damage for which Turner sought to recover was damage to the \u201cparticular part of real property\u201d on which Crest-Liners or Proulx was performing work. (See, e.g., <em>Montrose Chemical Corp. v. Superior Court </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 287, 300 [24 Cal.Rptr.2d 467, 861 P.2d 1153] [party asserting policy exclusion bears burden to show exclusion applies]; <em>Aguilar, supra, </em>25 Cal.4th at p. 851 [party who bears burden of proof at trial bears burden of production on motion for summary judgment].) In fact, as discussed above, the evidence before the trial court indicated that at least some of the damage at issue involved property other than the tank liner on which Crest-Liners was performing work.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">Exclusions (m)(l) and (m)(2) excluded coverage for \u201cproperty damage\u201d to \u201cimpaired property\u201d arising out of \u201c[a] defect, deficiency, inadequacy or dangerous condition in\u201d the insured\u2019s work, or \u201c[a] delay or failure by [the insured] ... to perform a contract or agreement in accordance with its terms.\u201d J&amp;H contends that these exclusions preclude coverage of Turner\u2019s claim against Proulx because Turner sought to recover only the costs it incurred in attempting to repair and replace the leaking liner. As we discussed above, however, the evidence before the trial court suggests that at least some of the costs Turner sought to recover were related to the repair or replacement of property other than the liner. Thus, there is a triable issue of fact precluding summary judgment based upon these exclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">E. <em>We Will Not Consider J&amp;H\u2019s Arguments Raised for the First Time on Appeal Because They Raise Factual Issues</em></p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">In addition to the arguments J&amp;H raised in the trial court, J&amp;H has raised additional arguments for the first time in its respondent\u2019s brief before this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">To support its contention that Turner\u2019s claim against Proulx must have been solely for intangible economic losses, J&amp;H argues that Turner could not have asserted a claim for property damage because Turner did not own the property damaged by Crest-Liners\u2019 defective installation of the tank liner. In addition, J&amp;H argues that exclusion (n)\u2014which excludes coverage for expenses incurred by the insured for the \u201closs of use, withdrawal, recall, inspection, repair, replacement, adjustment, removal or disposal of\u2019 the insured\u2019s defective product, work, or impaired property\u2014also bars coverage of Turner\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-9\">J&amp;H did not address in its separate statement of undisputed facts the issue of the damaged property\u2019s ownership, nor did it set forth facts to show that Proulx sought to recover only expenses it incurred for the \u201closs of use, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>withdrawal, recall, inspection, repair, replacement, adjustment, removal or disposal of\u2019 Proulx\u2019s defective product, work, or impaired property. Because each of J&amp;H\u2019s new arguments is based upon facts that are not set forth in the separate statement and theories not addressed in J&amp;H\u2019s moving papers in the trial court, we will not make any determination related to those facts or theories. (See <em>United Community Church v. Garcin, supra, </em>231 Cal.App.3d at p. 337 [facts not set forth in separate statement do not exist]; <em>Johanson Transportation Service v. Rich Pik\u2019d Rite Inc. </em>(1985) 164 Cal.App.3d 583, 588 [210 Cal.Rptr. 433] [\u201cpossible theories not fully developed or factually presented to the trial court cannot create a \u2018triable issue\u2019 on appeal\u201d and will not be considered by appellate court].) We note, however, that J&amp;H\u2019s \u201cproperty owner\u201d theory is premised on a misreading of the policy language. J&amp;H asserts that Turner could not have brought a claim against Proulx for property damage unless Turner was the owner of the property at issue. Although that theory might have validity if the policies stated that the insurer would \u201cpay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as property damages,\u201d the policies in fact state that the insurer will \u201cpay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of. . . \u2018property damage.\u2019 \u201d Thus, to prevail under this theory, J&amp;H will have to establish in the trial court that Turner had no right\u2014as a property owner or otherwise\u2014to recover the sums in question from Proulx.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">The judgment is reversed.
