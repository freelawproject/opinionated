The sole issue on appeal is whether the failure to declare the bond forfeited in open court as required by Penal Code section 1305, subdivision (a) exonerates the bond. We answer the question in the affirmative. Accordingly, we reverse the order and remand to the trial court with directions to vacate the forfeiture and exonerate the bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-10\">Facts and Proceedings Below</p>\n<p id=\"b248-11\">On July 13, 1999, Bert Potter Bail Bonds, as an agent for appellant National Automobile and Casualty Insurance Company (National), posted a $50,000 bond for the release of one Gabriel Galvan from custody. On November 1, 1999, the defendant failed to appear at a scheduled court hearing without sufficient excuse. The record reflects the following occurred in open court: \u201cPeople versus Galvan. HQ He\u2019s failed to appear. It\u2019s 9:35. HQ At counsel\u2019s request, the warrant is going to be issued and held. HQ <em>Bail </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number><em>status is revoked. </em>No bail warrant is issued. It will be held here until the 9th \u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">At a recess the clerk asked the court whether bail was forfeited. The judge said, \u201cyes.\u201d The minute order the clerk prepared for the day states, \u201cBail ordered forfeited.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">On November 9, 1999, the defendant again failed to appear and the court issued the bench warrant. Three weeks later on November 22, 1999, the clerk of the court mailed a notice of forfeiture to Bert Potter Bail Bonds and to National.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">Penal Code section 1305 requires a court to vacate a forfeiture and exonerate the bond if the defendant appears in court within 180 days of the date of forfeiture.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On two occasions the court granted National\u2019s requests to extend this time. National\u2019s last request to set aside the forfeiture extended time to December 2, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-9\">On November 29, 2000, National filed a motion to vacate the forfeiture and exonerate the bond on the ground the trial court had not properly declared the bail forfeited when the defendant first failed to appear as scheduled on November 1, 1999. Specifically, National contended the court lost jurisdiction over the bond because the court failed to declare the bail forfeiture in open court.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-10\">After reviewing the file and hearing oral argument the court denied the motion. As the trial court described the situation, \u201cIt\u2019s a motion to vacate the forfeiture on the basis that on November 1st when the defendant failed to appear, that <em>the transcript reflects that there was no forfeiture of the bail. </em>[^Q However, the minute order indicates that there was. And the court has its original notes here. And what it indicates is that <em>the court revoked the defendant\u2019s bail status, </em>and that the clerk then asked at the recess was the bail forfeited; and I said \u2018yes,\u2019 and so he put it in the minute order as well. [ID And this matter was before the court then on June 8th for a motion to extend, and there was no\u2014nothing brought up about a lack of the forfeiture of the bail. That was granted, that request. And on September 9th, it was again another motion to extend, and there was no mention of the question as to whether the bail was forfeited.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b249-11\">Accordingly, the trial court denied National\u2019s request to vacate the forfeiture and to exonerate the bond. National appeals from the adverse ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">I. <em>The 1998 Amendment to Penal Code Section 1305, Subdivision (a) Imposed the Additional Requirement Bail Be Declared Forfeit in Open Court.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">National argues the trial court failed to make an on-the-record pronouncement of bail forfeiture as required by statute and thus the forfeiture should be vacated and the bond exonerated. The People counter the bond should not be exonerated because the court substantially complied with the statutory requirements by clarifying its intended ruling in its minute order for the day.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-9\">In interpreting a statutory scheme our function is to ascertain the intent of the Legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law. \u201c \u2018To ascertain such intent, courts turn first to the words of the statute itself. . . , and seek to give the words employed by the Legislature their usual and ordinary meaning. . . . When interpreting statutory language, we may neither insert language which has been omitted nor ignore language which has been inserted. . . . The language must be construed in the context of the statutory framework as a whole, keeping in mind the policies and purposes of the statute . . . , and where possible the language should be read so as to conform to the spirit of the enactment. . . .\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201cIf the terms of the statute are unambiguous, we presume the lawmakers meant what they said, and the plain meaning of the language governs. [Citations.]\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b250-10\">Prior to its amendment in 1998, Penal Code section 1305, subdivision (a) required a declaration of bail forfeiture but did not specify any particular method for doing so. The statute then read: \u201cA court <em>shall declare forfeited </em>the undertaking of bail or the money or property deposited as bail if, without sufficient excuse, a defendant fails to appear for [a scheduled court appearance].\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thus, under section 1305, subdivision (a) as it formerly read a bail forfeiture was nevertheless valid when declared solely on the minute order prepared for the day.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b250-11\">In 1998 the Legislature amended this section to clarify the procedure for declaring a forfeiture by expressly requiring a court to declare a bail <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>forfeiture in open court. Section 1305, subdivision (a) now provides \u201cA court <em>shall in open court declare forfeited </em>the undertaking of bail or the money or property deposited as bail if, without sufficient excuse, a defendant fails to appear for [a scheduled court appearance].\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">The plain language of the amended statute indicates in order for bail to be forfeited a trial court must (1) make a declaration of forfeiture stating \u201cbail is forfeited\u201d (2) on the record while court is in session. The Legislature\u2019s use of the word \u201cshall\u201d signifies this dual requirement is mandatory.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">Legislative history of the amendment makes clear any other conclusion would frustrate the Legislature\u2019s purpose in imposing the \u201copen court\u201d requirement of providing sureties and their agents prompt notice of a defendant\u2019s nonappearance so they can take immediate steps to apprehend the fugitive.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">According to a report prepared for the Senate Committee on Public Safety the amendment was necessary \u201cto make the return of fleeing defendants swifter and easier. The longer a defendant remains at large, the greater the odds that he or she may commit other crimes, thereby putting the public at risk.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The Legislature determined open and public declarations of bail forfeitures addressed this problem. Rather than waiting days or weeks to receive written notice of bail forfeiture, the Legislature concluded notice of a bail forfeiture simultaneous with an unexcused absence of a defendant would permit sureties and their agents to immediately pursue the fugitive, which in turn would increase public safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">A summary of the bill prepared for the Assembly Committee on Public Safety explained: \u201cIf a defendant fails to appear at a scheduled court appearance, existing law requires that the court order the bail forfeited and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>the bail agent or surety notified within 30 days. <em>This bill requires that the declaration of forfeiture be made in open court at the time the defendant fails to appear and a bench warrant is issued. </em>This is a minor technical change to existing law and only requires the court to openly order forfeiture of the bail\u2014the rationale being that the bail agent receives notice of the forfeiture at the time, rather than when the notice is sent and is able to immediately pursue the fugitive. Despite Judicial Council\u2019s objection, <em>this requirement places an insignificant burden on the court as it only requires the court to state \u2018bail is forfeited\u2019. </em>It is a better practice to openly declare the forfeiture (most courts already follow this procedure) and do the same thing in respect to an exoneration of bail when a defendant is returned to court after the issuance of a bench warrant.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">The value of providing prompt notice to sureties and their agents was long ago recognized by our state\u2019s highest court. \u201cThere are sound reasons, . . . implicit in the pertinent statutory provisions for holding that a forfeiture of a bail bond, where required, must be timely declared. . . . If a surety is to be afforded the protections provided by these provisions he must be advised at an early date of the fact of the forfeiture in order that he many institute procedures to locate and compel the appearance of the bailee. Should the surety not have an early opportunity to institute these endeavors the possibility of discharging the forfeiture will be severely prejudiced, and it is manifest that he will suffer such prejudice whether there is an undue delay in advising him after the declaration of a forfeiture or a delay in making the declaration itself.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">The 1998 amendment is an extension of this policy. It ensures timely notice by expressly requiring courts to make an unequivocal declaration of bail forfeiture on the record the very moment the court concludes the defendant has failed to appear without sufficient excuse. This is turn furthers the amendment\u2019s purpose of providing timely notice and quickly apprehending fugitives.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">The trial court in the present case failed to comply with the statutory requirements. It did not declare the bail forfeited in open court. At a recess the court clerk inquired whether bail was revoked as well as forfeited. In its off-the-record discussion with the clerk the court agreed bail should be forfeited. The court did not recall the case to declare the bail <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>forfeited in open court as it could have done. Instead, during a recess in the proceedings it directed the clerk to enter a forfeiture on the minutes. The trial court candidly acknowledged at the hearing on National\u2019s request to vacate the bail forfeiture, \u201cthe transcript reflects that there was no forfeiture of the bail.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">The People argue the court\u2019s statement \u201cbail is revoked\u201d could logically in this instance include forfeiture. They point out the only instance in which a court may declare a forfeiture is when a defendant fails to appear, and the only fact before the court was the fact of the defendant\u2019s nonappearance. The People contrast this situation with those in which the defendant commits a new crime while out on bail, thus warranting revocation of bail, as distinguished from forfeiture due to an unexcused nonappearance. They distinguish the present case from the situation in <em>People v. Stuyvesant Ins. Co.</em><footnotemark><em>13</em></footnotemark><em> </em>where it was clear the trial court had ordered the defendant\u2019s bail status revoked rather than forfeited based on information the defendant had shot three persons while out on bail.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Thus the People argue the court\u2019s declaration of revocation should be considered synonymous with forfeiture in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">We are not persuaded the trial court simply misspoke.  Revocation of bail and forfeiture of bail have distinct legal meanings. \u201cForfeiture of bail\u201d can only occur in one circumstance\u2014when a defendant fails to appear at a scheduled court appearance without sufficient excuse. Bail in this context refers to the money or other property provided to secure the defendant\u2019s release from custody and assure his presence in court. It affects the surety and the persons who have supplied the underlying funding for the bond. \u201cRevocation of bail,\u201d by contrast, relates to a defendant\u2019s status and freedom from custody. A court may order bail status revoked for any number of reasons, and all without ordering bail forfeit, e.g., new information regarding his flight risk, commission of new crimes, additional crimes charged, or the like.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">Moreover, a person charged with a felony who willfully fails to appear as required after release on bail is chargeable with the entirely new and distinct felony offense of evading the court\u2019s process.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Thus the defendant\u2019s nonappearance is a crime in and of itself, which may alone be sufficient to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>justify a court in revoting a defendant\u2019s bail status\u2014without also requiring the defendant to commit an additional crime while on bail as the People\u2019s argument suggests. It is very possible the trial court in the present case did precisely what it intended to do in the circumstances\u2014i.e., to revoke the defendant\u2019s bail status for his failure to appear as scheduled.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">The People next argue it is obvious the trial court intended to declare a forfeiture because it \u201cclarified [its] ruling during a recess.\u201d The People request this court to construe the \u201cambiguity\u201d in the court\u2019s actions in favor of its intention as reflected instead in the clerk\u2019s minute order for the day stating bail is forfeited.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">As an initial matter we find nothing ambiguous about the court\u2019s pronouncement in open court. It ordered the defendant\u2019s bail status revoked and issued a bench warrant. The record is silent regarding forfeiture of the bond. Indeed, as noted, the trial court found no ambiguity but instead acknowledged it had <em>not </em>declared bail forfeited when the defendant failed to appear. Moreover, to accept the People\u2019s argument would be to ignore the statutory language prescribing the procedure for declaring bail forfeitures. It asks us to hold a trial court\u2019s silent intention, expressed to a court employee, and during a recess when court was not in session, satisfies the requirements of section 1305, subdivision (a) mandating bail forfeitures be declared in open court. No rule of statutory interpretation of which we are aware would permit this construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">Next the People claim a trial court has the power to make new and different orders provided it does so prior to the time the clerk enters the order in the \u201cpermanent minutes.\u201d Accordingly, they urge this court to find the clerk\u2019s minutes for the day reflect the true orders of the court. In support of their argument the People cite the decision in <em>People v. Surety Ins. Co.</em><footnotemark><em>17</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In <em>Surety, </em>the court in fact declared bail forfeited when the defendant failed to appear at a 9:00 a.m. trial conference without sufficient excuse. When the defendant appeared later the same day the trial court vacated the forfeiture and reinstated the bond.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The clerk of the court did not notify the surety the defendant had been tardy for his court appointment. The defendant failed to appear for the continued trial conference. Again the court ordered bail forfeited and issued a bench warrant. The clerk mailed notice of the forfeiture to the surety and its agent. The surety moved to set aside the forfeiture, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>contending the controlling statutes provided no authority to reinstate the bond without notice to the surety and thus the court lost jurisdiction to declare a forfeiture at the later date.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The trial court denied its motion. The appellate court affirmed. The court held until the court\u2019s order is entered in the permanent minutes for the day, a court has discretion to excuse a defendant\u2019s late appearance and reinstate bail as if it had never been forfeited and may do so without notifying the surety.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">The decision in <em>Surety </em>is inapposite. It does not discuss the requirements for declaring bail forfeited. Most importantly, contrary to what the People would have us believe, it does not stand for the proposition a trial court\u2019s failure to declare bail forfeited in open court may be cured by a similar recitation in the court\u2019s minutes. Accordingly, the People\u2019s reliance on this decision is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">The question then is the consequence of the trial court\u2019s failure to declare the bail forfeited in open court as the express terms of the amended statute require.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">II. <em>The Trial Court Lost Jurisdiction to Declare a Forfeiture of the Bond by Failing to Declare the Forfeiture in Open Court as Required by Section 1305, Subdivision (a).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b255-10\">National contends the bond must be exonerated as a matter of law because of the trial court\u2019s failure to comply with the requirements of section 1305, subdivision (a) for declaring forfeiture of a bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-11\">In reviewing the applicable bail statute we are mindful of the general rules governing the interpretation of bail bond statutes: \u201c \u2018 \u201cThe law traditionally disfavors forfeitures and this disfavor extends to forfeiture of bail. . . . Thus, Penal Code sections 1305 and 1306 dealing with forfeiture of bail bonds must be strictly construed in favor of the surety to avoid the harsh results of a forfeiture.\u201d [fl] The standard of review, therefore, compels us to protect the surety, and more importantly the individual citizens who pledge to the surety their property on behalf of persons seeking release from custody, in order to obtain the corporate bond.\u2019 . . . Sections 1305 and 1306 are said to be \u2018jurisdictional prescriptions.\u2019 . . . \u2018Failure to follow the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>jurisdictional prescriptions in sections 1305 and 1306 renders a summary judgment on the bail bond void. . . .\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">The People argue the statutory requirement of declaring bail forfeited in open court is not jurisdictional because in amending section 1305, subdivision (a) the Legislature did not expressly state failure to declare forfeiture in open court resulted in exoneration of the bail.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">It is true several statutory provisions regarding bail bonds expressly provide for exoneration of bail in the event of less than precise compliance with the statutory mandates.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> However, it is also true technical violations of other provisions of the bail statutes have nevertheless been held to be jurisdiction-defeating errors even in the absence of express language directing exoneration of bail for these violations.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">An example of this latter type of technical violation is closely analogous to the type of omission which occurred in this case.  To recall, under section 1305, subdivision (a) the court must declare bail forfeited in the event a defendant fails to appear for a scheduled court appearance \u201cwithout sufficient excuse.\u201d The statute has no provision specifying bail is exonerated in the event the trial court fails to articulate a \u201csufficient excuse\u201d on the record when declining or neglecting to declare a forfeiture due to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>defendant\u2019s nonappearance. Nevertheless, case law holds the requirement of stating reasons on the record in this circumstance is jurisdictional and the court loses jurisdiction to later declare a forfeiture in the event of a defendant\u2019s subsequent nonappearance.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">For example, in <em>People v. United Bonding Ins. Co.</em><footnotemark><em>24</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the defendant failed to appear on a date scheduled for pretrial motions. Counsel informed the court the defendant\u2019s whereabouts were unknown and that he might have fled the jurisdiction. The court issued a bench warrant for his arrest but did not order forfeiture of bail.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The defendant also failed to appear for trial several months later. The court then ordered bail forfeited and notified the surety and its agent.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">The Supreme Court held the trial court had lost jurisdiction to later declare the forfeiture having failed to exercise its right when the defendant first failed to appear without a sufficient excuse. \u201cThe language of the statute directs that the court \u2018must thereupon\u2019 declare the forfeiture when a defendant\u2019s nonappearance is \u2018without sufficient excuse,\u2019 and when it conclusively appears that there is no excuse as, for example, when the defendant has fled, the statute compels an immediate declaration. . . . [^ It follows from the foregoing that the court\u2019s failure to declare a forfeiture upon a nonappearance without sufficient excuse, either where no excuse is offered or where the finding of an excuse constitutes an abuse of discretion, deprives the court of jurisdiction to later declare a forfeiture. Court minutes which fail to disclose that the court has expressly excused a nonappearance on a record which is silent as to a defendant\u2019s reasons therefor, will require a reviewing court to conclude that a nonappearance was without sufficient excuse and that the right to declare a forfeiture not having been exercised was foreclosed. An excused nonappearance, accordingly, should be expressly reflected in the minutes.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Accordingly, the court found the order of forfeiture a nullity and directed the trial court to vacate the forfeiture and exonerate the bond.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">Another example is found in <em>People v. Frontier Pacific Ins. Co.</em><footnotemark><em>29</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In that case, \u201csufficient excuse\u201d for the defendant\u2019s nonappearance was apparently discussed in chambers. However, the trial court failed to articulate its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>findings of sufficient excuse on the record. Nothing in either the reporter\u2019s transcript or the minutes supplied any evidence of sufficient excuse for the defendant\u2019s failure to appear. The appellate court found the court\u2019s failure to make a record deprived the court of jurisdiction to declare a forfeiture at a later date, despite its probable initial finding of sufficient excuse. \u201cThe district attorney\u2019s belated explanation for a silent record does not alter our view. Even if we take the deputy district attorney\u2019s declaration as something more than mere speculation, the declaration fails to explain why the court did not merely state, either on the record or in the minutes, that as a result of an in camera conference, it had reason to believe that sufficient excuse existed for [the defendant\u2019s] failure to appear.\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Accordingly, the court held where the record of the actual proceedings fails to disclose the court found sufficient excuse for the defendant\u2019s nonappearance, the court loses jurisdiction to later declare a forfeiture of bail.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">The reasoning of these decisions finding technical violations of section 1305 jurisdiction defeating error is equally applicable here. Similar to the situation in <em>Frontier, </em>the facts before the trial court in this case justified a declaration of forfeiture. However, as in <em>Frontier, </em>the trial court neglected to state its intention on the record, which deprived the court of jurisdiction to later declare a forfeiture. Also, similar to the situation in <em>United Bonding, </em>the intended action of the trial court was invalid because it failed to make the necessary findings on the record. The failure to make the required findings on the record in those cases is indistinguishable from the court\u2019s failure in the present case to declare the bail forfeited \u201cin open court\u201d as compelled by the statutory language. Accordingly, the result should be the same as well. As directed by our Supreme Court \u201c \u2018where a statute requires a court to exercise its jurisdiction in a particular manner, follow a particular procedure, or subject to certain limitations, an act beyond those limits is in excess of its jurisdiction. . . .\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">Following this directive, and the dictates of strict construction of bail forfeiture statutes as we must, we conclude the trial court\u2019s failure to expressly state bail is forfeited in open court as mandated by section 1305, subdivision (a) resulted in the court losing jurisdiction to later attempt to forfeit the bail by simply noting it in the minutes.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Accordingly, we reverse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>the court\u2019s order and remand with directions to the trial court to vacate the forfeiture and exonerate the bond.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">The order is reversed and the cause remanded to the trial court with directions to vacate the forfeiture and exonerate the bond.

Nothing in the bail statutes authorizes a court to consider prejudice in deciding whether a violation of section 1305 results in an exoneration of bail. As the court in <em>People </em>v. <em>American Contractors Indemnity Co. </em>noted, \u201cauthorities make clear, the statutory [requirements] of sections 1305 and 1306 are considered inviolable and do not depend on whether or not a party has suffered prejudice. No basis exists to depart from this well-established pattern by creating an exception\u201d when the trial court fails to provide the statutorily mandated notice by declaring bail forfeited in open court. <em>(People v.
