J.</author>\n<p id=\"APr\">Cunningham Enterprises, Inc. (Cunningham), sued its liability insurer, Universal Underwriters (Universal), alleging Universal breached its duty to defend Cunningham in an action brought by a third party. After Cunningham and Universal each moved for summary judgment, the court denied Universal\u2019s motion, granted Cunningham\u2019s motion, and entered judgment in Cunningham\u2019s favor for $197,837.59 plus costs. Universal appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-9\">We conclude the undisputed facts establish the absence of a potential for coverage under the relevant insurance policies and therefore Universal had no duty to defend Cunningham in the underlying action. Thus, the trial court erred in granting Cunningham summary judgment and in denying Universal\u2019s summary judgment motion. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment and remand for the court to enter summary judgment in Universal\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-10\">Factual Summary</p>\n<p id=\"b897-11\">This case concerns whether Universal had a duty to defend Cunningham in an action brought by Steven Beus and his limited liability company (collectively Beus). Beus\u2019s complaint alleged the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b897-12\">In April 1996, Beus met with a real estate agent representing Cunningham regarding potential sites for an Isuzu dealership. The agent showed Beus property owned by Cunningham located on Johnson Avenue in El Cajon (the Johnson property). The Johnson property consisted of a front lot and a rear lot. \u201cThe rear lot was \u2018improved\u2019 with dilapidated and unsightly . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1146\">*1146</page-number>buildings.\u201d The front lot was improved with structures appropriate for use as an automobile dealership. Cunningham\u2019s real estate agent told Beus that the tenant on the front lot, Holland Motor Homes, would vacate the premises in late November or early December.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-4\">In September 1996, Beus and Cunningham entered into a. written lease agreement pertaining to the Johnson property. Although the agreement specifically provided that the January 1, 1997 lease commencement date was \u201csubject to . . . Holland . . . vacating the Premises,\u201d Beus alleged that \u201cthe true intent of the parties was that the lease commencement date could be made earlier, but not later, than January 1, 1997.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b898-5\">In reliance on representations that Holland would be vacating the property no later than January 1, 1997, Beus expended funds to open the dealership on that date, including entering into agreements with the local redevelopment agency, obtaining loans from Isuzu, and paying for the demolition of the buildings on the rear lot. Beus also ordered an inventory of new Isuzu vehicles to be delivered to the new dealership.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-6\">While waiting to occupy the main portion of the lot, Beus moved into the vacant back lot, and stored the new Isuzu vehicles at this lot. On December 28, 1996, Beus representatives attempted to take possession of the front portion of the lot. But Holland representatives said that Holland would not vacate the premises for another two weeks. In the succeeding six weeks, Beus made numerous demands for possession of the front portion of the Johnson property, receiving in return a series of promises and representations from Cunningham and others that Holland would vacate the premises by certain dates. Meanwhile, Beus attempted to \u201coperate out of a damp, tin building remaining on the rear lot portion of the premises with no phones, no electricity, and no plumbing.\u201d Because of its inability to move into the front lot, Beus was unable to obtain a sales license from the Department of Motor Vehicles, and thus was unable to generate any revenue.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-7\">Six weeks later, on February 18, 1997, Holland finally vacated the Johnson property, and Cunningham delivered full possession of the premises to Beus. During the next year, Beus remained in possession of the property and operated the dealership.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-8\">In February 1998, approximately one year after opening the dealership, Beus was \u201cforced to close the doors\u201d of the business and move out of the property. Beus then sued Cunningham and several others, alleging that Cunningham\u2019s late delivery of the premises caused the dealership to \u201cfail[] to be profitable.\u201d Beus claimed the late delivery caused substantial additional losses, including the inability to take full advantage of the dealership <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1147\">*1147</page-number>incentive programs, interest charges on the new vehicle credit line, six weeks in salary paid to employees who could not productively perform their services, lease payments on the computer system, and loss of good will, new and used car sales, and working capital. Beus asserted five substantive causes of action: (1) breach of contract; (2) intentional misrepresentation; (3) negligent misrepresentation; (4) intentional interference with prospective economic advantage; and (5) intentional interference with contractual relations.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-4\">Cunningham tendered the defense to Universal, which denied the tender. Cunningham eventually settled the action with Beus for $80,000. Cunningham then brought an action against Universal, alleging that Universal had a duty to defend because there was potential coverage under the policy\u2019s personal injury wrongful eviction coverage and property damage coverage. Both parties filed summary judgment motions. The trial court entered judgment in Cunningham\u2019s favor, determining there was a potential for coverage under the personal injury provision of Universal\u2019s insurance policy, and Universal was thus responsible for $117,837.59 reflecting Cunningham\u2019s underlying defense costs and $80,000 reflecting the underlying settlement amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b899-6\">I. <em>Generally Applicable Legal Principles</em></p>\n<p id=\"b899-7\">A \u201cparty moving for summary judgment bears the burden of persuasion that there is no triable issue of material fact and that [the party] is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>(Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 850 [107 Cal.Rptr.2d 841, 24 P.3d 493].)  In a duty to defend case, an insurer moving for summary judgment \u201cmust establish <em>the absence of any . . . potential\u201d </em>for coverage, i.e., that the underlying complaint \u201c <em>\u2018can by no conceivable theory raise a single issue which could bring it within the policy coverage.\u2019\u2019 </em>\u201d <em>(Montrose Chemical Corp. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 287, 300 [24 Cal.Rptr.2d 467, 861 P.2d 1153] <em>(Montrose).) </em>In contrast, to prevail on its summary judgment motion, the insured need only show \u201cthe existence of a <em>potential for coverage,\u201d </em>i.e., \u201cthat the underlying claim <em>may </em>fall within policy coverage.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b899-8\">Although the insurer\u2019s burden in moving for summary judgment is greater than the insured\u2019s burden in bringing its own affirmative motion, this disparity \u201cmerely reflects the substantive law.\u201d <em>(Montrose, supra, 6 </em>Cal.4th at p. 300.) \u201c[A]n insurer has a duty to defend an insured if it becomes aware of, or if the third party lawsuit pleads, facts giving rise to the potential for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1148\">*1148</page-number>coverage under the insuring agreement. [Citations.] This duty, which applies even to claims that are \u2018groundless, false, or fraudulent,\u2019 is separate from and broader than the insurer\u2019s duty to indemnify.\u201d <em>(Waller </em>v. <em>Truck Ins. Exchange, Inc. </em>(1995) 11 Cal.4th 1, 19 [44 Cal.Rptr.2d 370, 900 P.2d 619].) \u201c[T]he determination whether the insurer owes a duty to defend usually is made in the first instance by comparing the allegations of the complaint with the terms of the policy.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>But \u201c \u2018[w]hether a particular claim falls within the coverage afforded by a liability policy is not affected by the form of the legal proceeding [or] the legal theory asserted by the\u201d injured party. <em>(Vandenberg v. Superior Court </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 815, 841 [88 Cal.Rptr.2d 366, 982 P.2d 229].) The scope of the duty does not depend on the labels given to the causes of action in the third party complaint; instead it rests on whether the <em>alleged facts </em>or <em>known extrinsic facts </em>reveal a possibility that the claim may be covered by the policy. (See <em>Hurley Construction Co. v. State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co. </em>(1992) 10 Cal.App.4th 533, 538 [12 Cal.Rptr.2d 629].) In determining the existence of a duty to defend on a summary judgment motion, we conduct a de novo review. <em>(Lomes v. Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. </em>(2001) 88 Cal.App.4th 127, 131 [105 Cal.Rptr.2d 471].)</p>\n<p id=\"b900-4\">II. <em>Universal\u2019s Summary Judgment Motion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b900-5\">In moving for summary judgment, Universal argued the undisputed facts established there was no potential for coverage under the two types of coverage relied upon by Cunningham: (1) personal injury coverage; and (2) property damage coverage. With respect to each type of coverage, we begin by examining the language of the insurance policy, and then we determine whether the allegations of Beus\u2019s complaint (and any relevant extrinsic evidence) show a potential for coverage under the relevant policy provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-6\">A. <em>Personal Injury Coverage</em></p>\n<p id=\"b900-7\">The personal injury coverage under Cunningham\u2019s policy states that Universal will pay all sums that Cunningham is required to pay as damages \u201cbecause of Injury.\u201d The policy defines \u201c \u2018Injury\u2019 \u201d to include \u201cfalse arrest, false imprisonment, <em>wrongful eviction, </em>wrongful detention, malicious prosecution, abuse of process, libel, slander, defamation of character, private nuisance (except pollution), and <em>invasion of rights of privacy or possession of personal property.\u201d </em>(Italics added.) As with most forms of personal injury liability insurance, the coverage does not require an \u201c \u2018accidental occurrence,\u2019 \u201d and instead \u201c \u2018. . .is triggered by one of the offenses listed in the policy.\u2019 [Citation.] Although the offenses enumerated in a policy are construed broadly when they are defined in generic terms, they encompass \u2018\u201c. . . specific torts which <em>reasonably </em>could fall within the general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1149\">*1149</page-number>category.\u201d [Citation.]\u2019 \u201d <em>(Zelda, Inc. v. Northland Ins. Co. (1997) 56 </em>Cal.App.4th 1252, 1263 [66 Cal.Rptr.2d 356]; <em>Fibreboard Corp v. Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity Co. </em>(1993) 16 Cal.App.4th 492, 515 [20 Cal.Rptr.2d 376].)</p>\n<p id=\"b901-4\">Tendering the defense of the Bens action, Cunningham claimed it was potentially covered under the wrongful eviction category of personal injury. In its summary judgment motion, Universal argued that wrongful eviction presupposes the injured party was removed or ousted from real property, and there was nothing in Beus\u2019s complaint or the extrinsic facts to show a removal or ouster allegedly occurred in this case. Cunningham countered that a wrongful eviction claim within the meaning of the policy includes not only a removal from real property but also encompasses other forms of interference with a party\u2019s present or future right to use the property. The trial court adopted this definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">In resolving these conflicting interpretations of the phrase \u201cwrongful eviction,\u201d we apply settled rules of insurance policy construction. As with any contract, the goal of insurance policy interpretation \u201cis to determine and give effect to the mutual intention of the parties.\u201d <em>(Safeco Ins. Co. v. Robert S. </em>(2001) 26 Cal.4th 758, 763 [110 Cal.Rptr.2d 844, 28 P.3d 889].) In so doing, we must \u201clook first to the language of the [insurance policy] in order to ascertain its plain meaning or the meaning a layperson would ordinarily attach to it.\u201d <em>(Waller v. Truck Ins. Exchange, Inc., supra, </em>11 Cal.4th at p. 18.) If the policy provision is unambiguous, i.e., has only one reasonable construction, it must be interpreted according to this plain meaning. <em>(Ray v. Valley Forge Ins. Co. </em>(1999) 77 Cal.App.4th 1039, 1044 [92 Cal.Rptr.2d 473].) But if a policy provision is ambiguous, the ambiguous terms \u201c \u2018are resolved in the insureds\u2019 favor, consistent with the insureds\u2019 reasonable expectations.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Safeco Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Robert S., supra, 26 </em>Cal.4th at p. 761.)</p>\n<p id=\"b901-6\">Under these principles, we look first at the plain meaning of a wrongful eviction. The term \u201cevict\u201d means \u201c[t]o expel... by legal process; put out\u201d; \u201c[t]o force out; eject; dispossess\u201d; \u201c[t]o recover (property, for example) by a superior claim or legal process.\u201d (American Heritage Dict. (new college ed. 1981) pp. 454-455.) These dictionary definitions comport with the commonly understood meaning of the word\u2014an eviction requires that a person first be in actual possession of real property, and then be removed from that property. (See <em>Zelda, Inc. v. Northland Ins. Co., supra, </em>56 Cal.App.4th at p. 1265 [\u201can eviction, popularly understood, is necessarily from <em>somewhere\u201d].) </em>The legal definition of an eviction is the same: an \u201ceviction\u201d is \u201c[t]he act or process of legally dispossessing a person of land or rental property.\u201d (Black\u2019s Law Dict. (7th ed. 1999) p. 575, col. 2.) A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1150\">*1150</page-number><em>wrongful </em>eviction thus occurs when the person recovering the property had no right to dispossess the other party from the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-4\">Applying this plain meaning of the policy language, Beus\u2019s claims against Cunningham do not reasonably fall within the category of a wrongful eviction. The undisputed facts show that Beus\u2019s claims against Cunningham centered solely on Beus\u2019s inability to <em>take </em>possession of the front portion of the Johnson property. There was nothing in the complaint or the extrinsic evidence supporting a claim or the possibility of a claim that Cunningham <em>removed or expelled </em>Beus from any portion of the property. On this record, there was no potential for personal injury coverage under Cunningham\u2019s policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-5\">Cunningham\u2019s arguments to the contrary are unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-6\">Cunningham first argues that courts have expanded the phrase \u201cwrongful eviction\u201d beyond its commonly understood meaning to include \u201cany claims of disturbance with the tenant\u2019s [potential] right of possession.\u201d  We agree that if an insurance policy term has been judicially construed, this construction should be read into the policy unless the parties express a contrary intent. (See <em>Bartlome v. State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co. </em>(1989) 208 Cal.App.3d 1235, 1239 [256 Cal.Rptr. 719].)  But the predicate of Cunningham\u2019s argument is missing. Cunningham has not cited, and our independent research has not disclosed, any reported decision that has interpreted the language of the wrongful eviction provision in the policy before us to encompass claims for interference with future or existing property rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-7\">To show courts have interpreted the \u201cwrongful eviction\u201d phrase beyond its commonly understood meaning, Cunningham relies on <em>General Accident Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>West American Ins. Co. </em>(1996) 42 Cal.App.4th 95 [49 Cal.Rptr.2d 603] <em>(General Accident). </em>In that case, the underlying plaintiff managed an insurance agency and leased the premises occupied by the agency. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 99.) After the partnership entities (the insureds) terminated his contract and \u201c \u2018ousted\u2019 \u201d him from the premises, the plaintiff sued the insureds alleging wrongful termination, breach of contract, and tortious interference. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 99-100.) The insureds tendered the claim under two insurance policies. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 100-101.) The first policy provided coverage for \u201cinjury arising out of \u2018wrongful entry or eviction, <em>or other invasion of the right of private </em>occupancy\u2018 committed in the conduct of the insured\u2019s business.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 103, italics added.) The <em>General Accident </em>court found there <em>was </em>coverage under this provision because the insured invaded the injured party\u2019s right of private occupancy. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 104.) In so concluding, the court noted in dicta <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1151\">*1151</page-number>that the phrase \u201c \u2018 <em>\u201cother invasion of the right of private </em>occupancy\u201d \u2019 \u201d did not require a <em>physical invasion </em>of an interest in real property. (Ibid., italics added.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The second insurance policy provided coverage for personal injury arising out of \u201c \u2018[wjrongful entry into, or eviction of a person from, a room, dwelling or premises that the person occupies . . . <em>(General Accident, supra, </em>42 Cal.App.4th at p. 104.) Stating that this provision \u201cnarrows the definition of this particular offense\u201d to \u201c \u2018some physical act of eviction or entry upon premises,\u2019 \u201d the court found a potential for coverage under this policy, emphasizing that the third party plaintiff\u2019s complaint alleged that the insured entities had \u201cousted\u201d him from the property and interfered with his right to occupy the premises. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 104-105.)</p>\n<p id=\"b903-4\"><em>General Accident </em>does not support an expanded definition of the phrase \u201cwrongful eviction\u201d in the policy before us. The first <em>General Accident </em>insurance policy contained the additional \u201c <em>\u2018or other invasion of the right of private </em>occupancy\u2019 \u201d phrase that is not included in the Universal policy. <em>(General Accident, supra, </em>42 Cal.App.4th at p. 103, italics added.) The Universal policy instead specifically limits the \u201cinvasion\u201d of property rights coverage to \u201cpersonal property\u201d interests, which are necessarily limited to claims such as conversion or damage to personal property. (See <em>ante, </em>at p. 1148.) Although the second <em>General Accident </em>insurance policy contained policy language that was closer to Universal\u2019s policy language because it did not include the \u201cother invasion of the right to private occupancy\u201d phrase, the court\u2019s analysis is inapplicable here because the insured in that case had <em>physically ousted </em>the underlying plaintiff from his business premises. (See <em>Stein-Brief Group, Inc. v. Home Indemnity Co. </em>(1998) 65 Cal.App.4th 364, 373 [76 Cal.Rptr.2d 3] [In <em>General Accident, </em>\u201cwe . . . found a potential for coverage, and thus a duty to defend, based on the [underlying plaintiff\u2019s] claims that he was ousted and ejected from the business premises, which was leased in his name as an individual\u201d].) Here, there were no similar facts showing Cunningham made any attempt to oust or eject Beus from any portion of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-5\">Cunningham alternatively attempts to show a broad judicial construction by directing us to the line of cases holding a wrongful eviction in a comprehensive general liability policy includes a constructive eviction. (See <em>Legarra v. Federated Mutual Ins. Co. </em>(1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 1472, 1484 [42 Cal.Rptr.2d 101]; <em>Giraud v. Milovich </em>(1938) 29 Cal.App.2d 543, 547-549 [85 P.2d 182].) This argument is not helpful because even if Universal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1152\">*1152</page-number>policy\u2019s personal injury coverage could be construed to include this legal meaning of a wrongful eviction, there are no facts showing the possibility of a constructive eviction claim in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-4\">An eviction is actual when a landlord takes direct action to physically expel the tenant from the premises. An eviction is constructive if the landlord engages in acts that render the premises unfit for occupancy for the purpose for which it was leased, or deprive the tenant of the beneficial enjoyment of the premises. <em>(Kulawitz v. Pacific etc. Paper Co. </em>(1944) 25 Cal.2d 664, 670 [155 P.2d 24]; <em>Sanders v. Allen </em>(1948) 83 Cal.App.2d 362, 366 [188 P.2d 760].)  Cunningham contends that Beus\u2019s complaint potentially supports a constructive eviction claim because Beus alleged it took possession of the rear portion of the Johnson property and this portion of the property was in an unsatisfactory condition for use as a car dealership.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-5\">This argument is unavailing because there are no allegations or extrinsic evidence showing that the condition of the rear lot had anything to do with the damages allegedly suffered by Beus. Beus did not seek any damages regarding the condition of the back lot; instead Beus\u2019s requested damages related solely to its inability to move into the front portion of the lot on the lease commencement date. To establish a potential for coverage under the Universal policy\u2019s personal injury coverage, Cunningham was required to show the third party\u2019s claimed damages were allegedly <em>caused </em>by the wrongful eviction. Cunningham did not, and could not, satisfy this element with respect to the condition of the rear lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-6\">Additionally, any claims regarding the condition of the rear lot cannot constitute a constructive eviction claim because it is undisputed that Beus never vacated this portion of the lot, and instead remained in possession of the entire property until Beus closed the business one year later.  \u201cIn order that there be a constructive eviction it is essential that the tenant should vacate the property. There is no constructive eviction if the tenant continues in possession of the premises however much he may be disturbed in the beneficial enjoyment.\u201d <em>(Lori, Ltd. v. Wolfe </em>(1948) 85 Cal.App.2d 54, 65 [192 P.2d 112]; accord, <em>Green </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1974) 10 Cal.3d 616, 625, fn. 10 [111 Cal.Rptr. 704, 517 P.2d 1168] <em>(Green) </em>[\u201cto avail himself of the [constructive eviction] doctrine a tenant must vacate the premises\u201d]; <em>Veysey v. Moriyama </em>(1921) 184 Cal. 802, 805-806 [195 P. 662, 20 A.L.R. 1363]; <em>Guntert v. City of Stockton </em>(1976) 55 Cal.App.3d 131, 140-141 [126 Cal.Rptr. 690, 127 Cal.Rptr. 602]; <em>Ryan v. Huffman </em>(1948) 88 Cal.App.2d 728, 731-732 [199 P.2d 407]; 4 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (9th ed. 1987) Real Property, \u00a7 574, pp. 748-750.)</p>\n<p id=\"b904-7\"><em>Guntert v. City of Stockton, supra, </em>55 Cal.App.3d 131, relied upon by Cunningham, does not support a contrary cohclusion. <em>Guntert </em>merely clarified that a landlord\u2019s interference with a tenant\u2019s quiet enjoyment may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1153\">*1153</page-number>support an action for damages even if the tenant does not move out of the premises. (See <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Placer Title Co. </em>(1994) 28 Cal.App.4th 503, 513-514 [33 Cal.Rptr.2d 572].) While a claim for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment is similar to a constructive eviction claim, the critical difference is that the latter claim may not be brought until the tenant has vacated the property. (See <em>Green, supra, </em>10 Cal.3d at p. 625, fn. 10; Friedman et al., Cal. Practice Guide: Landlord-Tenant (The Rutter Group 2001) 5] 7:298, p. 7-61 [\u201cTo invoke a constructive eviction defense or remedy, the aggrieved tenants must <em>surrender or vacate </em>within a reasonable time after the landlord\u2019s material interference with the lease\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b905-4\">In a different vein, Cunningham argues that we should expansively interpret the \u201cwrongful eviction\u201d language of the Universal policy based on the insurance industry\u2019s interpretations of the language. In support, Cunningham quotes from the July 1985 Fire Casualty &amp; Surety Bulletin (Bulletin) as follows: \u201c <em>\u2018Wrongful eviction can be anything done by a landlord or his agent that is intended to and results in the tenant being deprived of use, occupancy, or enjoyment of all or part of the leased </em>premises.\u2019 \u201d (Italics added.) Cunningham maintains this interpretation establishes that the phrase \u201cwrongful eviction\u201d was intended to include all forms of interference with a tenant\u2019s existing or future property rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-5\">We agree that a definition of an insurance term contained in an insurance industry bulletin may be relevant to defeat an insurer\u2019s contention that the term in a standard commercial liability policy should be more narrowly construed. (See <em>Maryland Casualty Co. v. Reeder </em>(1990) 221 Cal.App.3d 961, 972-973 [270 Cal.Rptr. 719].) However, the Bulletin was not part of the evidentiary record below. It was not proffered by either party in support or opposition to the summary judgment motions, and instead was cited only in Cunningham\u2019s summary judgment briefs. \u201c \u2018[Wjhen reviewing the correctness of a trial court\u2019s judgment, an appellate court will consider only matters which were part of the record at the time the judgment was entered.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Vons Companies, Inc. v. Seabest Foods, Inc. </em>(1996) 14 Cal.4th 434, 444, fn. 3 [58 Cal.Rptr.2d 899, 926 P.2d 1085].)</p>\n<p id=\"b905-6\">Moreover, when this court asked Cunningham\u2019s counsel to produce a copy of the material that was the basis for its asserted quotation concerning the Bulletin, counsel produced only an excerpt of a July 1998 California Continuing Education of the Bar program handbook entitled Identifying and Using Insurance Coverage in Business Litigation, which contains a series of paragraphs discussing different types of personal injury coverage. The language quoted in Cunningham\u2019s appellate brief comes from one of these paragraphs, which merely paraphrases and does not purport to quote from the Bulletin. This material was therefore of no help in construing the policy language before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1154\">*1154</page-number>Several weeks later, Cunningham notified us that it had finally obtained a copy of the Bulletin and submitted excerpts of that Bulletin to this court. Even assuming we could properly consider this evidence, it does not support Cunningham\u2019s position. Most significantly, the Bulletin makes clear that its discussion is limited to the pre-1986 version of the standard wrongful eviction coverage. As recognized by two California appellate courts, in 1985 a broad form of the standard wrongful eviction clause (\u201cwrongful entry or eviction, <em>or other invasion of the right of private occupancy\u201d) </em>was in effect, but this version was narrowed by the Insurance Services Organization as part of the 1986 standard form comprehensive general liability policy. <em>(General Accident, supra, </em>42 Cal.App.4th at p. 104, italics added; see <em>Martin Marietta Corp. v. Insurance Co. of North America </em>(1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 1113, 1122 [47 Cal.Rptr.2d 670].) The post-1985 standard policies no longer included the \u201cor other invasion of the right of private occupancy\u201d clause. <em>(General Accident, supra, </em>42 Cal.App.4th at p. 104.)</p>\n<p id=\"b906-4\">The relevant personal injury coverage at issue here is materially different from the pre-1986 version discussed in the Bulletin. Universal\u2019s policy provides coverage only for wrongful eviction, and does not include the <em>\u201cother </em>invasion of the right of private occupancy\u201d language of the pre-1985 standard policies. Thus, we cannot assume that the version of the policy language discussed in the Bulletin was equivalent to the policy language before us. Further, the Bulletin refers to the Ballentine\u2019s Law Dictionary as the source of its definitions of policy language. Ballentine\u2019s Law Dictionary defines \u201ceviction\u201d as a \u201c[dispossession, actual or constructive,\u201d including a \u201cdisturbance of [a tenant\u2019s] possession, . . . depriving him of the enjoyment of the demised premise, or any portion thereof, by title paramount or by entry and act of the landlord.\u201d (Ballentine\u2019s Law Dict. (3d ed. 1969) p. 424, col. 1.) Cunningham\u2019s alleged failure to timely deliver possession to Beus does not fit into these definitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-5\">An \u201cinsurer\u2019s duty to defend is not absolute but is measured by the nature and kinds of risks covered by the policy.\u201d <em>(Rosen </em>v. <em>Nations Title Ins. Co. </em>(1997) 56 Cal.App.4th 1489, 1497 [66 Cal.Rptr.2d 714].) Thus, our focus must be on \u201cthe language of the policy itself, not upon \u2018general\u2019 rules of coverage that are not necessarily responsive to the policy language.\u201d <em>(American Cyanamid Co. v. American Home Assurance Co. </em>(1994) 30 Cal.App.4th 969, 978 [35 Cal.Rptr.2d 920].) Further, although we must resolve any doubt as to whether the facts establish a defense duty in the insured\u2019s favor, \u201c[w]e may not impose coverage by adopting a strained or absurd inteipretation in order to create an ambiguity where none exists.\u201d <em>(Rosen v. Nations Title Ins. Co., supra, </em>56 Cal.App.4th at p. 1497; accord, <em>Waller v. Truck Ins. Exchange, Inc., supra, </em>11 Cal.4th at p. 19.)  Here, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1155\">*1155</page-number>a determination that Beus\u2019s complaint alleged a wrongful eviction claim would be a strained and unreasonable interpretation of the policy language, and thus we decline to adopt Cunningham\u2019s policy construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-4\">B. <em>Property Damage Coverage</em></p>\n<p id=\"b907-5\">Cunningham alternatively argues there was a duty to defend because there was a potential for coverage under the property damage provisions of Universal\u2019s policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-6\">Universal\u2019s policy provides it will pay all sums Cunningham must pay as damages \u201cbecause of Injury to which this insurance applies caused by an Occurrence.\u201d \u201c \u2018Injury\u2019 \u201d is defined to include \u201cdamage to or loss of use of tangible property.\u201d An \u201c \u2018Occurrence\u2019 \u201d is defined to mean \u201can accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to conditions . . . neither intended nor expected from the standpoint of a reasonably prudent person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b907-7\">Cunningham maintains that Beus\u2019s complaint alleged an occurrence, i.e., Cunningham\u2019s negligent failure to expel Holland from the property, and sought covered property damages, i.e., losses arising from Beus\u2019s inability to use the front portion of the Johnson property. Even assuming we could construe Beus\u2019s complaint to potentially allege an occurrence, there is no possibility of coverage because Beus did not allege covered property damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-8\">The Universal policy\u2019s property damage provision covered only those claims alleging \u201cdamage to or loss of use of <em>tangible </em>property.\u201d (Italics added.) The California Supreme Court recently interpreted this standard insuring clause to hold the provision does not cover the loss of use of <em>intangible </em>property rights. <em>(Kazi </em>v. <em>State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co. </em>(2001) 24 Cal.4th 871, 879 [103 Cal.Rptr.2d 1, 15 P.3d 223] <em>(Kazi).) </em>The court reasoned that \u201c \u2018tangible property\u2019 refers to things that can be touched, seen, and smelled\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 880), and \u201cas a matter of law\u201d interference with a \u201cnonpossessory \u2018 \u201cinterest in the land of another\u201d \u2019 \u201d does not satisfy this definition. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 881, 880.) Applying this principle, the <em>Kazi </em>court held the loss of use of an easement did not qualify as property damage because an easement is an intangible property right more akin to the loss of an investment than fee simple property ownership. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 880.)</p>\n<p id=\"b907-9\">Under these principles, Cunningham\u2019s claim for a defense under Universal\u2019s property damage provision fails. Beus\u2019s claimed loss concerned solely an intangible property right\u2014the interference with its right to possession of real property under the parties\u2019 lease. A tenant\u2019s right to possess property on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1156\">*1156</page-number>the lease commencement date is a contractual right that does not mature into a property right until possession actually occurs. A landlord\u2019s failure to deliver possession of the premises merely gives the tenant a right to abandon the tenancy and sue for damages, but does not give the tenant the legal right to act as a possessor of the real property until the date of the actual transfer. A nonpossessing tenant has no greater possessory property rights than does an easement holder. In this regard, Cunningham\u2019s reliance on <em>Hendrickson </em>v. <em>Zurich American Ins. Co. </em>(1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 1084 [85 Cal.Rptr.2d 622] is misplaced because the injured parties in that case were in full possession of the property claimed to have been damaged by the insured\u2019s tortious conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-4\">We further reject Cunningham\u2019s argument that Beus alleged covered property damage by asserting that Cunningham\u2019s tortious conduct caused Beus to suffer a \u201closs of use\u201d of personal property, i.e., the inventory of the new vehicles. Cunningham\u2019s claimed failure to deliver the real property on the commencement date did not cause a \u201closs of use\u201d of the vehicles within any reasonable interpretation of the phrase. At most, Cunningham\u2019s alleged conduct caused economic damages relating to the inability to use the land to sell the vehicles. This does not reflect covered property damage within the meaning of the policy. (See <em>Continental Casualty Co. v. Superior Court </em>(2001) 92 Cal.App.4th 430, 443 [111 Cal.Rptr.2d 849].)</p>\n<p id=\"b908-5\">Because Beus\u2019s complaint alleged only an intangible economic loss, it did not constitute the type of \u201closs of use\u201d property damage necessary to trigger coverage under the property damage policy provisions. (See <em>Kazi, supra, </em>24 Cal.4th at pp. 880-881; <em>Waller v. Truck Ins. Exchange, Inc., supra, </em>11 Cal.4th at p. 17; see also <em>Continental Casualty Co. v. Superior Court, supra, </em>92 Cal.App.4th at p. 443.) A contrary conclusion would provide a landlord with liability coverage in every tenant holdover case where the succeeding tenant alleges a breach of the commencement date\u2014a result that could not have been envisioned when the landlord purchased liability coverage for <em>property damage. </em>Where, as here, the \u201cfundamental nature of [the] transactions [between the parties] is economic,\u201d an insurer generally does not have a duty to defend \u201ceven though the litigation will encompass issues relating to property damage.\u201d <em>(Continental Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>92 Cal.App.4th at p. 443.)</p>\n<p id=\"b908-6\">We note further that the result here is consistent with a specific exclusion in the policy stating that \u201c[t]his insurance does not apply to . . . loss of use of property not physically damaged, if caused by: (1) [Cunningham\u2019s] delay or failure in performing any agreement or contract . . . .\u201d This exclusion applies as a matter of law because Beus did not allege the property was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1157\">*1157</page-number>physically damaged, and Bens sought damages based exclusively on Cunningham\u2019s delay in failing to perform its obligations with respect to the lease commencement date.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-4\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b909-5\">Judgment reversed. The matter is remanded for the trial court to vacate its order granting summary judgment to Cunningham, and to enter summary judgment in Universal\u2019s favor. Universal to recover costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-6\">O\u2019Rourke, J., and McConnell, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-7\">Respondents\u2019 petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied July 17, 2002. Brown, J., did not participate therein.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b903-6\"> Four years later, the same court held that it was \u201cmistaken\u201d in asserting this dicta and that the phrase \u201c \u2018wrongful entry or eviction or other invasion of the right of private occupancy\u2019 \u201d <em>does </em>require an allegation of a <em>physical </em>invasion onto the property. <em>(Sterling Builders, Inc. </em>v. <em>United Nat.
