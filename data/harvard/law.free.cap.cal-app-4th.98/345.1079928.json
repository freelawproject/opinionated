J.</author>\n<p id=\"ABd\">Jonathan Cobb appeals a judgment denying his petition for writ of administrative mandate (Code Civ. Proc.,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u00a7 1094.5) reviewing a rent control decision of the San Francisco Residential Rent Stabilization and Arbitration Board (Rent Board). Cobb sought to set aside the Rent Board\u2019s decision establishing the base rental of his tenant, Richard Passalacqua, as $600. He contends he is entitled to a base rental of $1,500 under the Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1954.50 et seq.; Costa-Hawkins Act).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">Factual Background<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">Since 1984, Cobb has owned and resided in one unit of a four-unit apartment building. Sometime in 1984, he rented another unit to Frances Restoni for $440 per month. Cobb acknowledged that he lost the Restoni rental agreement, but, according to Cobb, it was a standard form rental agreement, which provided that a \u201cTenant shall not assign this agreement or sublet any portion of the premises without prior written consent of the Owner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">Cobb never increased Restoni\u2019s rent. In March 1996, Restoni\u2019s son, Richard Passalacqua, moved into her apartment without obtaining Cobb\u2019s permission. According to Passalacqua, his son, Joseph, then 15 years old, also began living half-time in the apartment. According to Cobb, whenever he asked , about Passalacqua\u2019s plans, Restoni and Passalacqua both replied that Passalacqua was staying only temporarily.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">In May 1998, Restoni vacated her apartment due to ill health. Thereafter, Cobb accepted rent from Passalacqua, who had not paid him rent as long as Restoni was living in the apartment. Effective November 1, 1998, the rent was raised to $600 per month, pursuant to an oral agreement between Cobb and Passalacqua. Passalacqua thought the increase was \u201cfair.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b300-9\">In late spring 1999 Joseph, then 18 years old, began living full-time in the apartment. In June 1999 Cobb served Joseph with a \u201c6.14 Notice.\u201d The notice informed Joseph that \u201c(1) [wjhen the last tenant vacates the premises, a new tenancy is created for purposes of determining the rent under the [San Francisco Residential Rent Stabilization and Arbitration Ordinance (Rent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>Ordinance)]; and (2) [a]ll new co-tenants or occupants are not considered tenants under subsection (a) of Section 6.14 of the [Rent Board\u2019s] Rules and Regulations.\u201d The notice included a copy of rule 6.14, as amended March 24, 1998.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Under the Rent Ordinance, a new tenancy permits a landlord to increase the rent without the Rent Ordinance limitations on rental increases to an in-place tenant. (S.F. Admin. Code, \u00a7 37.3, subd. (d)(1)(A).)</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">It is undisputed that Cobb never served Passalacqua with a 6.14 Notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">By letter dated June 16,1999, Cobb\u2019s attorney admonished Passalacqua of his obligation to pay his rent in a timely fashion, and failing to do so, \u201cyour landlord may lawfully terminate your rental agreement on the ground that you have habitually paid the rent late.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">In mid-September 1999, Cobb notified Passalacqua that, effective November 1, 1999, the rent would increase to $1,500 per month, in accordance with the Costa-Hawkins Act. Passalacqua then petitioned the Rent Board for arbitration on the grounds that the rent increase to $1,500 was beyond the limits permitted under the Rent Ordinance. Cobb responded that the rent increase was not governed by the Rent Ordinance but by the Costa-Hawkins Act because Passalacqua moved into the apartment after January 1996 and Restoni, its original occupant, had since vacated it.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">The section of the Costa-Hawkins Act on which Cobb relied states: \u201cWhere the original occupant . . . who took possession of the . . . unit pursuant to the rental agreement with the owner no longer permanently reside[s] there, an owner may increase the rent by any amount allowed by this section to a lawful sublessee or assignee who did not reside at the . . . unit prior to January 1, 1996.\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1954.53, subd. (d)(2).)</p>\n<p id=\"b301-9\">Proceedings Before the Rent Board</p>\n<p id=\"b301-10\">The Rent Board hearing officer concluded that the Costa-Hawkins Act was inapplicable because Passalacqua was not a sublessee or assignee of Restoni. Instead, he became Cobb\u2019s tenant when Cobb began accepting rent from him in May 1998. The hearing officer also observed that \u201cthere is not compelling evidence\u201d the original lease contained a prohibition against subleases or assignments without the landlord\u2019s prior written permission. But even if it did, the hearing officer concluded that Cobb waived any prohibition in the original rental agreement by his conduct. The landlord accepted rent, including a rent increase, from Passalacqua; he sent him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>notices of habitually late rent payments; and, despite knowing Passalacqua was living in the apartment as early as 1996, failed to take any action to confirm that Passalacqua\u2019s residency was temporary.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">The hearing officer granted Passalacqua\u2019s petition and ordered that his current base rent remain $600, with an anniversary date of \u201cNovember.\u201d The order does not give a year for the anniversary date, but it is presumably November 1998, when Passalacqua\u2019s rent was increased to $600.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">Cobb appealed the hearing officer\u2019s decision to the Rent Board, which accepted the appeal and remanded it for a hearing on the issues of waiver and estoppel. Specifically, the hearing officer was to determine: (1) Did Cobb\u2019s acceptance of rent from Passalacqua after Restoni moved out constitute a waiver of the Costa-Hawkins Act, insofar as Cobb did not receive written notice of Passalacqua\u2019s occupancy of the apartment and thereafter accepted rent? (2) Was Passalacqua estopped from asserting that Cobb waived his statutory right to a market rate increase because he attempted to deceive Cobb into accepting rent by claiming that he was residing in the apartment only temporarily?</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">The hearing officer granted Passalacqua\u2019s petition on remand after concluding Cobb failed to establish waiver or estoppel. When Cobb\u2019s appeal to the Rent Board was denied, he filed the instant petition for administrative mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">This appeal follows the denial of Cobb\u2019s petition by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-8\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b302-9\">Cobb contends the Rent Board\u2019s decision<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> was an abuse of discretion because it was not supported by the evidence and was contrary to the provisions of the Costa-Hawkins Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-10\">I. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b302-11\">In determining whether to grant a writ pursuant to section 1094.5, the trial court inquires whether there was a prejudicial abuse of discretion in the administrative agency\u2019s decision. (\u00a7 1094.5, subd. (b).) An abuse of discretion is established if the agency has not proceeded in the manner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>required by law, its decision is not supported by the findings, or the findings are not supported by the evidence. (\u00a7 1094.5, subd. (b).) Where there is a claim that the findings are not supported by the evidence and, in matters like this where the court does not exercise its independent judgment on the evidence, abuse of discretion is established if the court determines that the findings are not supported by substantial evidence in light of the whole record. (\u00a7 1094.5, subd. (c); <em>Getz v. City of West Hollywood </em>(1991) 233 Cal.App.3d 625, 627 [284 Cal.Rptr. 631].)</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">The appellate court reviews the agency\u2019s decision under the same substantial evidence standard used by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">II. <em>Timeliness of Petition</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">HI. <em>Costa-Hawkins Act</em></p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">Prior to enactment of the Costa-Hawkins Act, local rent control ordinances were generally categorized as \u201cstrict\u201d or \u201cmoderate.\u201d \u201cStrict\u201d or \u201cvacancy control\u201d ordinances continued control of the rent on a unit when it became vacant, prohibiting an increase when a new tenant occupied the unit. \u201cModerate\u201d or \u201cvacancy decontrol\u201d ordinances, such as the San Francisco Rent Ordinance, permitted a landlord to raise the rent on a unit to market rate when it became vacant and a new tenant moved in; once this new rent was determined the rent was again controlled during this tenant\u2019s occupancy. (Legis. Analyst, analysis of Assem. Bill No. 1164 (1995-1996 Reg. Sess.) p. 2.)</p>\n<p id=\"b303-9\">The Costa-Hawkins Act establishes vacancy decontrol for residential dwelling units where the former tenant has voluntarily vacated, abandoned or been legally evicted. (Legis. Analyst, analysis of Assem. Bill No. 1164 (1995-1996 Reg. Sess.) p. 2.) Thus, \u201c[notwithstanding any other provision of law, an owner of residential real property may establish the initial rental rate for a dwelling or unit,\u201d except in specified situations. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1954.53, subd. (a).) Although the Costa-Hawkins Act does not define \u201cinitial rental rate,\u201d the parties do not dispute that Civil Code section 1954.53, subdivision (a) permits landlords to impose whatever rent they choose at the commencement of a tenancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-10\">As previously noted, the Costa-Hawkins Act also provides that the landlord may increase the rent by any amount to the lawful sublessee or assignee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>of the original occupant when the original occupant no longer resides in the unit permanently and the sublessee or assignee did not reside in the unit prior to January 1, 1996. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1954.53, subd. (d); Legis. Analyst, analysis of Assem. Bill No. 1164 (1995-1996 Reg. Sess.) p. 3.) Passalacqua did not reside in the apartment until March 1996. Therefore, the CostaHarris Act entitled Cobb to impose a rental rate in an amount of his choosing, as he sought to do with his notice of rent increase effective November 1,1999, if either of two circumstances was present: Passalacqua\u2019s initial occupancy as a new tenant commenced on that date (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1954.53, subd. (a)), or Passalacqua was Restoni\u2019s sublessee or assignee as of that date (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1954.53, subd. (d)). Substantial evidence supports the Rent Board\u2019s findings that Passalacqua was not a sublessee or assignee on November 1, 1999, but rather that he became a tenant in his own right in June 1998 or at least no later than October 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">&gt;5</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">Under the Costa-Hawkins Act, \u201ctenancy\u201d includes the lawful occupation of property, as well as a lease or sublease. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1954.51, subd. (f).) The Rent Ordinance defines \u201ctenant\u201d as a \u201cperson entitled by written or oral agreement. . . or by sufferance, to occupy a residential dwelling unit to the exclusion of others.\u201d (S.F. Admin. Code, \u00a7 37.2, subd. (t).)  A tenancy may be created by consent and acceptance of rent, despite the absence of a lease. <em>(Getz v. City of West Hollywood, supra, </em>233 Cal.App.3d at p. 629.)</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">Cobb knew as of mid-May 1998 that Restoni no longer lived in the unit. He acknowledged that he began accepting rent in the full amount directly from Passalacqua alone as of June 1998. He negotiated a rent increase with Passalacqua in October 1998, to take effect November 1, 1998; Restoni was not involved in the negotiation. He complained to Passalacqua in June 1999 that the rent was habitually delinquent and requested delinquent rent payments from him, without reference to any obligation on Restoni\u2019s part for the rent. He sought a rent increase directly from Passalacuqua in September 1999. This evidence reasonably demonstrates that Cole deemed Passalacqua, not Restoni, his sole tenant as of June 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">Furthermore, there was no evidence to support a finding that Passalacqua was Restoni\u2019s subtenant or assignee after her departure.  A subtenant has only a portion of an interest in a lease; the original lessee retains a right of reentry at some time during the unexpired term of the lease. <em>(Kendall v. Ernest Pestana, Inc. </em>(1985) 40 Cal.3d 488, 492, fn. 2 [220 Cal.Rptr. 818, 709 P.2d 837].) For an assignment to be effective, it is essential that the owner of the right to be transferred manifest an intention to transfer the right, and the burden of proving an assignment lies with the party asserting the rights <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>thereunder. <em>(Cockerell </em>v. <em>Title Ins. &amp; Trust Co. </em>(1954) 42 Cal.2d 284, 291-292 [267 P.2d 16]; <em>Sunburst Bank v. Executive Life Ins. Co. </em>(1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 1156, 1164 [29 Cal.Rptr.2d 734].)</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">Restoni performed no obligations under the lease after she moved out of the apartment. Nothing in her conduct or Passalaccqua\u2019s subsequent conduct implied that she retained any interest in the apartment. Likewise, there was an absence of evidence from which to find that Restoni manifested an intent to transfer her right to occupy the apartment to Passalacqua. The Rent Board could reasonably infer that she moved out because her health demanded it, and she did so without regard to whether Passalacqua or anyone else remained in the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">On this evidence the Rent Board could find that Passalacqua was an existing tenant when Cobb notified him in September 1999 that his rent would be increased effective November 1, 1999. Therefore, the CostaHawkins Act did not provide authority for the amount of the increase Cobb sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">IV-VI<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b305-9\">The judgment denying Cobb\u2019s petition for writ of administrative mandate is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-10\">Simons, J., and Gemello, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-11\">On May 9, 2002, the opinion was modified to read as printed above.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b300-10\"> Unless otherwise indicated, all further statutory references are to the Code of Civil Procedure.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b300-11\"> Our factual summary is drawn from evidence presented before the Rent Board\u2019s administrative law judge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b301-11\"> Rule 6.14 is discussed further in a nonpublished portion of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b302-12\"> We recognize that the decision and findings therein were actually made by a hearing officer, although the Rent Board ultimately voted to deny the landlord\u2019s appeal.
