In separate actions<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>, both Pacific Northwest Bell, et al, and the Oregon Association of Broadcasters, et al, alleged that the \"tagline\u201d portion of the Commissioner\u2019s order was invalid because the \"tag-line\u201d rule exceeded the Commissioner\u2019s statutorily delegated authority and violated various constitutional provisions including those protecting the right to freedom of speech.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The \"tagline\u201d rule, OAR 860-21-075, requires that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1056-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1002\">*1002</page-number>\"(1) All investor-owned public utililties subject to the jurisdiction of the Public Utility Commissioner shall include in all printed, radio and television advertisements directed to Oregon ratepayers a statement that the advertisement is paid for by either the customers or the stockholders.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1056-3\">Although Pacific Northwest Bell also had attacked the \"guidelines\u201d portion of the Commissioner\u2019s order, the \"tagline\u201d aspect of the case was consolidated with the Oregon Association of Broadcasters case which challenged only the \"tagline\u201d rule ORS 11.050<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>. As to this aspect of the Commissioner\u2019s order, the trial court granted the plaintiffs\u2019 motions for summary judgment, holding that the \"tagline\u201d rule exceeded the limits of the Commissioner\u2019s delegated authority. The Commissioner appeals.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1056-4\">The \"guidelines\u201d portion of the Commissioner\u2019s order deals with the treatment of utility advertising expenditures in a rate proceeding. In general, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1003\">*1003</page-number>\"guidelines\u201d create a presumption that most utility advertising expenses are reasonable up to one-half percent of net operating income. In addition, the \"guidelines\u201d provide that expenditures for certain kinds of advertising will not be allowed in a rate proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-3\">On this aspect of the Pacific Northwest Bell case, the trial court granted the Commissioner\u2019s motion for summary judgment and held that the \"guidelines\u201d were valid. Pacific Northwest Bell appeals, contending that the \"guidelines\u201d exceed the Commissioner\u2019s delegated authority and that, in any event, summary judgment should not have been granted. The utility contends that the \"guidelines\u201d violate various constitutional provisions<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and that the entry of summary judgment was inappropriate because genuine issues of material fact, relating to the utility\u2019s constitutional claims, were in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-4\">Although the \"tagline\u201d and \"guidelines\u201d aspects of these cases were separately briefed and argued on appeal, the two portions of the Commissioner\u2019s order may be dealt with in a single opinion. We affirm the trial court\u2019s rulings with one modification.</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-5\">The \"tagline\u201d rule is set out below.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The rule mandates that regulated utilities must include in their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1005\">*1005</page-number>advertisements \"* * * a statement that the advertisement is paid for by either the customers or the stockholders.\u201d The rule defines certain types of advertising and directs which types of advertising must be labeled as being paid for by customers and which types should be labeled as being paid for by stockholders.</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-3\">The trial court held that this rule was outside the ambit of the Commissioner\u2019s authority.</p>\n<p id=\"A0mA\">A \"* * * rule is valid * * * if it is within the legislative delegation of authority, <em>Angelos v. Bd. of Dental Examiners, </em>244 Or 1, 414 P2d 335 (1966); <em>Or. Newspaper Publ. v. Peterson, </em>244 Or 116, 415 P2d 21 (1966), and is reasonably calculated to accomplish the legislative purpose, <em>Van Ripper v. Liquor Cont. Com., </em>228 Or 581, 365 P2d 109 (1961) * * *\" <em>Crouse v. Workmen\u2019s Comp. Bd., </em>26 Or App 849, 852, 554 P2d 568 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"ArM\">In seeking to identify the statutory delegation of authority underlying the \"tagline\u201d rule, the Commissioner relies on statutes which give him broad regulatory authority. ORS 756.040(1) and (2) provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1059-9\">\"(1) In addition to the powers and duties now or hereafter transferred to or vested in the commissioner, he shall represent the customers of any public utility, railroad, air carrier or motor carrier, and the public generally in all controversies respecting rates, valuations, service and all matters of which he has jurisdiction. In respect thereof he shall make use of the jurisdiction and powers of his office to protect such customers, and the public generally, from unjust and unreasonable exactions and practices and to obtain for them adequate service at fair and reasonable rates.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1059-10\">\"(2) The commissioner is vested with power and jurisdiction to supervise and regulate every public utility, railroad, air carrier and motor carrier in this state, and to do all things necessary and convenient in the exercise of such power and jurisdiction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1059-11\">ORS 756.060, which sets out the Commissioner\u2019s general rulemaking authority, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1060-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1006\">*1006</page-number>\"* * \u00ab commissioner may adopt and amend reasonable and proper rules and regulations relative to all statutes administered by him and may adopt and publish reasonable and proper rules to govern his proceedings and to regulate the mode and manner of all investigations and hearings of public utilities, railroads, air carriers, motor carriers and other parties before him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1060-3\">Despite these expansive statutes, the decision in <em>Or. Newspaper Publ. v. Peterson, supra, </em>compels the conclusion that the statutes do not delegate to the Commissioner the authority to enact the \"tagline\u201d rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-4\">In <em>Peterson, </em>the court considered the validity of a regulation of the State Board of Pharmacy which prohibited the public advertisement of prescription drugs. Although the Board of Pharmacy had broad statutory authority to \"[m]ake regulations * * * pertaining to the practice of pharmacy * * and to \"[r]egulate the sale of poisons,\u201d ORS 689.620,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the court held that this statute did not delegate to the board the authority to prohibit advertising of prescription drugs. The court noted that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1060-5\">\"In the absence of a statute which grants a presumption of validity to administrative regulations, an administrative agency must, when its rule-making power is challenged, show that its regulation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1007\">*1007</page-number>falls within a clearly defined statutory grant of authority. <em>Safeway Stores v. State Bd. Agriculture, </em>198 Or 43, 71, 255 P2d 564 (1953); and see, for cases elsewhere, 1 Cooper, State Administrative Law, supra at 252. The reason behind this rule is that the people, by adopting the state constitution, conferred upon the Legislative Assembly the power to legislate. Therefore this power is not by implication to be delegated to nonelective officers. The tendency of administrators to expand the scope of their operations is perhaps as natural as nature\u2019s well-known abhorrence of a vacuum. But no matter how highly motivated it may be, the tendency to make law without a clear direction to do so must be curbed by the overriding constitutional requirement that substantial changes in the law be made solely by the Legislative Assembly, or by the people. Oregon Constitution, Art IV, \u00a7 1 * * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1061-3\">\"* * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1061-4\">\"Nothing in ORS 689.610 or elsewhere in the same chapter suggests that advertising was contemplated as a proper subject of regulation. The sale of certain chemicals for human consumption may be regulated, but the law is silent upon the manner in which such merchandise may be advertised.\u201d 244 Or at 123-124. (Footnotes ommitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1061-5\">ORS 756.040 and ORS 756.060, both <em>supra, </em>do not constitute a \"clearly defined statutory grant of authority\u201d for the enactment of the \"tagline\u201d rule. Like the statute in <em>Peterson, </em>they speak of broad general authority but nowhere mention \"advertising\u201d.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1061-6\">The Commissioner attempts to avoid the controlling impact of <em>Peterson </em>by underscoring <em>Peterson\u2019s </em>reference to \"* * * a statute which grants a presumption of validity to administrative regulations * * *,\u201d and he relies on ORS 756.565 which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1062-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1008\">*1008</page-number>\"* * * All rates, tariffs, classifications, regulations, practices and service fixed, approved or prescribed by the commissioner and any order made or entered upon any matter within his jurisdiction shall be in force and shall be prima facie lawful and reasonable^ * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1062-4\">This statute does not serve to distinguish these cases from <em>Peterson. </em>ORS 756.565 grants only a rebuttable presumption of validity to the Commissioner\u2019s regulations, and that presumption applies only to matters \"within his jurisdiction * * * *\u201d The Commissioner\u2019s reliance on the statute begs the question which is whether the \"tagline\u201d rule is within the bounds of the Commissioner\u2019s delegated authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-5\">The Commissioner also argues that he does have the statutory authority to regulate advertising. He points to ORS 757.105(1)(c) which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1062-6\">\"(1) The commissioner has the right and power of regulation, restriction and control over the budgets of expenditures of public utilities, as to all items covering:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1062-7\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1062-8\">\"(c) Political contributions and political advertising.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1062-9\">ORS 757.105(l)(c) is of little avail to the Commissioner here. Even if the statute supports the Commissioner\u2019s authority to regulate political advertising, the specific mention of that type of advertising in the statute suggests that other types of advertising are not included within the statutory delegation of authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-10\">At first glance ORS 757.105(1)(c) might seem to establish the validity of the \"tagline\u201d rule at least as applied to \"political advertising\u201d. However, the mere reference to political advertising in the statute does not give the Commissioner general authority over <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1009\">*1009</page-number>such advertising. The statute deals with the Commissioner\u2019s authority over \"budgets and expenditures\u201d for political advertising, but does not grant the Commissioner authority over the specific content of political advertising. To paraphrase <em>Peterson, supra, </em>244 Or at 124, nothing in ORS 757.105(1)(c) or elsewhere suggests that advertising was contemplated as a proper subject of regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-3\">The Commissioner seeks to link the \"tagline\u201d rule to his budgetary authority and to his general ratemak-ing authority by arguing that the rule will provide utility customers with information on the sources of funds for utility advertising, that this information will result in more informed communication between customers and the Commissioner, and that this improved communication will assist the Commissioner in representing utility customers. ORS 756.040(1), <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1063-4\">This argument is more attenuated than the argument rejected by the Supreme Court in <em>Peterson. </em>If the Board of Pharmacy\u2019s authority over the \"sale of poisons\u201d and the \"practice of pharmacy\u201d did not allow it to prohibit the advertising of prescription drugs, then the Commissioner\u2019s duty to represent utility customers and his authority over certain budget expenditures and over rate proceedings does not allow him to \"tag\u201d utility advertising in the hope that customers will be more informed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-5\">The \"tagline\u201d rule is not within the limits of the authority delegated to the Commissioner and therefore we affirm the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the rule is invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-6\">We next turn to the \"guidelines\u201d portion of the Commissioner\u2019s order. As we noted above, the trial court held that the \"guidelines\u201d portion of the order was valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1010\">*1010</page-number>The \"guidelines\u201d are set out below.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> They are based upon the same definitions of various types of advertising that are employed in the \"tagline\u201d rule. <em>See </em>n. 6, <em>supra. </em>As to most types of advertising expenditures, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1011\">*1011</page-number>the \"guidelines\u2019 provide that \"* * * to the extent they are not excessive, [they are] deemed to benefit ratepayers and will be allowed for ratemaking purposes unless shown by competent evidence to be of a character not beneficial to ratepayers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-3\">The \"guidelines\u201d describe the burden of proof in more detail as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1065-4\">\"Advertising expenditures which exceed one-half of one percent of net operating income as determined by a utility\u2019s most recent rate order will be presumed excessive. Similarly, an increase of advertising expenditures in excess of ten percent from one year to the next will be presumed excessive. A utility which seeks to include expenditures in excess of either amount will have the burden of showing that its expenditures have benefited or were reasonably intended to benefit its ratepayers. Parties challenging expenditures which are less than that amount will have the burden of showing that they were unwise, imprudent, or were not of benefit to the utility\u2019s ratepayers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1065-5\">\"In each instance, these guidelines create rebuttable presumptions. The tests are: expenditures to be disallowed must be shown to be unwise, imprudent or of no benefit to ratepayers; expenditures to be included for ratemaking purposes must be shown to be of benefit to ratepayers.\u201d (Footnote omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1066-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1012\">*1012</page-number>In addition to these general burden of proof provisions, the \"guidelines\u201d provide specific treatment for certain types of advertising expenditures.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1066-3\">\"Political advertising, and communication investments which state or imply that persons should take a specific political action will not be allowed for ratemaking purposes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1066-4\">\"Promotional advertising * * * is generally contrary to the public interest and will not be allowed for ratemaking purposes unless shown to benefit ratepayers. Efforts to encourage off-peak usage, not intended to increase total consumption, are not included in the definition of promotional advertising.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1066-5\">\"Institutional advertising will not be allowed for ratemaking purposes. This guideline might seem to conflict with the guideline which allows investor communication. However, although investor communications may tend to enhance the credibility, reputation, character or image of the utility, investor confidence is of major and direct importance to ratepayers.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Abj\">The plaintiffs present distinct challenges to the various portions of the \"guidelines.\u201d They first contend that the standard of proof provisions are invalid because they contravene or impermissibly expand on the statutory standard of proof, ORS 757.210,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and because they are not reasonably calculated to accomplish the legislative purpose. <em>See, Crouse v. Workmen\u2019s Comp. Bd., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1066-8\">The plaintiffs first argue that the \"guidelines\u201d substitute \"benefit to ratepayers\u201d for the statutory \"just and reasonable\u201d test. ORS 757.210.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1013\">*1013</page-number>This argument is not persuasive. The \"guidelines\u201d state that expenditures will be disallowed in a rate proceeding if they are \"excessive,\u201d \"unwise, imprudent, or [are] not of benefit to the utility\u2019s ratepayers.\u201d These phrases do not conflict with or alter the statutory \"just and reasonable\u201d test. An expenditure which is \"excessive\u201d would not be \"just and reasonable.\u201d Unjust and unreasonable expenditures would not \"benefit ratepayers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-4\">ORS 756.060, <em>supra, </em>delegates to the Commissioner the authority to \"* * * adopt and publish reasonable and proper rules to govern his proceedings and to regulate the mode and manner of all investigations and hearings of public utilities * * * *\u201d The general standard of proof provisions contained in the guidelines do not contravene the test set out in ORS 757.210, <em>supra, </em>and they are within the scope of the authority delegated in ORS 756.060. <em>See American Can Co. v. Davis, </em>28 Or App 207, 216, 559 P2d 898 <em>rev. den, </em>(1977); <em>Pacific N.W. Bell v. Sabin, </em>21 Or App 200, 224, 534 P2d 984 <em>rev den, </em>(1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-6\">The plaintiffs rely on <em>Southern Pacific Company v. Heltzel, </em>201 Or 1, 268 P2d 605 (1954) as supporting their argument that the \"guidelines\u201d formulation of the standard of proof conflicts with the statutory \"just and reasonable\u201d test. However, the <em>Southern Pacific </em>case does not assist the plaintiffs here. In that opinion the court observed that the term \"unreasonable\u201d has the \"connotation of excessive,\u201d and that the phrase \"just and reasonable\u201d was \" 'employed to establish a maximum limitation for the protection of the public * * * *\u2019\u201d 201 Or at 24, 29 (quoting from <em>In re The Chicago, St. Paul &amp; Kansas City Railroad Company, </em>2 Interstate Commission Reports 231). These observations support, rather than undercut the Commissioner\u2019s description of the standard of proof in the \"guidelines.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"APRx\">Despite plaintiffs\u2019 contentions, the portion of the \"guidelines\u201d which provides that, \"[advertising <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1014\">*1014</page-number>expenditures which exceed one-half of one percent of net operating income as determined by a utility\u2019s most recent rate order will be presumed excessive,\u201d is also valid. This formulation of the burden of proof is within the scope of the Commissioner\u2019s authority over rate proceedings, ORS 756.060, ORS 757.210, both <em>supra, </em>and is a reasonable standard to guide the exercise of the Commissioner\u2019s ratemaking authority. <em>See American Can Co. v. Davis, supra; Pacific N.W. Bell v. Sabin, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AQs4\">The plaintiffs next attack the more specific portions of the \"guidelines\u201d which disallow advertising expenditures for political and institutional advertising, and which provide that promotional advertising \"will not be allowed for ratemaking purposes unless shown to benefit ratepayers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-6\">The plaintiffs contend that these provisions are outside the limits of the Commissioner\u2019s authority and that they are unreasonable. The plaintiffs maintain that the \"guidelines\u201d impermissibly predetermine the treatment of expenditures in a rate proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-7\">The Commissioner has broad ratemaking authority. ORS 757.205, 757.245; <em>Pacific N.W. Bell v. Sabin,, supra. </em>The \"guidelines\u201d provisions for political, institutional and promotional advertising do not predetermine the treatment of specific advertising expenditures in a rate proceeding. The provisions merely establish standards for the evaluation of certain general types of advertising expenditures. <em>See Sun Ray Drive-In Dairy v. OLCC, </em>20 Or App 91, 530 P2d 887 (1975). As the Commissioner\u2019s order notes, the definitions of types of advertising \"* * * are not rigid. Some advertisements will fall into more than one category, and their cost will be prorated between categories if appropriate ****\u2019\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-9\">In <em>Multnomah County v. Davis, </em>35 Or App 521, 523-24, 581 P2d 968 (1978) this court upheld the validity of the Commissioner\u2019s rule</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1069-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1015\">*1015</page-number>\"* * * directing how utilities shall allocate certain taxes levied by counties in computing rates charged to utility customers. The effect of the rule [was] that utility expenses resulting from payment of the county\u2019s net business income tax [were] passed on to county ratepayers only rather than being reflected as part of a utility\u2019s general rate structure * * * *\u201d (footnotes omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1069-3\">This court said that the rule was a valid standard to guide the exercise of the Commissioner\u2019s broad ratemaking authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-4\">The more specific portions of the \"guidelines\u201d dealing with political, institutional and promotional advertising are also valid standards which clarify the broad authority granted to the Commissioner by the legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-9\">However, plaintiffs suggest that ORS 757.105(1)(c), <em>supra, </em>which gives the Commissioner authority over budgets of expenditures for political advertising, means that the commisioner may apply the \"guidelines\u201d only to political advertising. In the past, this court has rejected other variations of this argument. For example we have held that the budget statutes, including ORS 757.105, expand upon, and do not limit the Commissioner\u2019s ratemaking authority. <em>Cascade Natural Gas Corp. v. Davis, </em>28 Or App 621, 630-31, 560 P2d 301 (1977) <em>rev den.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1069-10\">Plaintiffs next attack the \"guidelines\u201d by contending that, even if the \"guidelines\u201d are within the scope of the Commissioner\u2019s authority, they are not reasonably calculated to accomplish the legislative purpose. <em>Crouse v. Workmen\u2019s Comp. Bd, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1069-7\">Contrary to plaintiffs\u2019 contention, the purpose of the burden of proof provisions seems clear.

In any event, the plaintiffs again exaggerate the effect and the rigidity of the \"guidelines\u201d. The \"guidelines\u201d establish standards; they do not prospectively disallow specific advertising expenditures. Promotional advertising may be allowed in a rate proceeding if shown to benefit the ratepayers. The \"guidelines\u201d are within the scope of the Commissioner\u2019s authority and they are valid.</p>\n<p id=\"A_m\">Plaintiffs\u2019 final contention is that, even assuming the subject matter of the \"guidelines\u201d rule was within the commissioner\u2019s jursidiction, the trial court erred in allowing the Commissioner\u2019s motion for summary judgment in the face of plaintiffs\u2019 further claims that the \"guidelines\u201d conflict with various constitutional provisions. We do not reach this question because we hold that, as the Commissioner suggested below, the court should have declined to entertain a declaratory judgment proceeding with respect to the plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional claims. The thrust of these constitutional claims, as outlined in the affidavit upon which plaintiffs rely, is that the \"guidelines\u201d <em>as applied in a ratemaking proceeding </em>will deprive them of certain constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-8\">\"It is fundamental to appellate jurisprudence that courts do not sit 'to decide abstract, hypothetical, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1017\">*1017</page-number>contingent questions * * * or <em>to decide any constitutional question in advance of the necessity for its decision </em>* * *.\u2019 <em>Federation of Labor v.

A reading of the ORS chapters creating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1018\">*1018</page-number>the position of Public Utility Commissioner and describing his powers and duties convinces me that his function is distinguishable from that of the Board of Pharmacy and that the legislature has granted the Commissioner sufficient authority to justify the \"tag-line\u201d regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-3\">At the time of the <em>Peterson </em>decision the Board of Pharmacy was composed of five members all of whom had to be licensed Pharmacists.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Apart from several more specific powers, the Board was empowered by former ORS 689.620 to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1072-4\">\"(1) Make regulations, necessary for the protection of the public, pertaining to the practice of pharmacy and the lawful performance of its duties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1072-5\">\"(2) Regulate the practice of pharmacy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1072-6\">As quoted by the majority, the <em>Peterson </em>court concluded that nothing in ORS 689.620 or elsewhere in the chapter suggests that advertising was contemplated as a proper subject of regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-7\">In the case before us we are dealing not with a competitive profession regulated by its own members, but with public utilities regulated by a commissioner who is not allowed to have any pecuniary interest in those entities which are subject to his regulation. ORS 756.026(l)(c) and (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-8\">The Commissioner is given broad investigatory and regulatory powers in ORS chs 756 and 757. As cited by the majority ORS 756.040(1) empowers the Commissioner to \"represent the customers * * * generally in all controversies respecting rates, valuations, service and all matters of which has been jurisdiction\u201d and to \"protect such customers, and the public generally, from unjust and unreasonable exactions and practices and to obtain for them adequate service at fair and reasonable rates.\u201d I do not agree with the majority\u2019s interpretation which would make this statute a toothless</p>\n<p id=\"A1J\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1019\">*1019</page-number>grant of authority, since the authority granted therein is specifically granted '[i]n addition to the powers and duties now or hereafter transferred to or vested in the commissioner. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-3\">ORS 756.040(2) empowers the Commissioner to regulate and supervise public utilities in furtherance of the jurisdiction granted by section (1) and \"to do all things necessary and convenient in the exercise of such power and jurisdiction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-4\">I read ORS 756.040, in conjunction with the rule-making authority provided by ORS 756.060, as granting the Commissioner the authority to make regulations which will aid him in his statutory function of protecting the customer. I believe my reading is bolstered by ORS 756.062(2) which calls for a liberal construction of the laws administered by the Commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-5\">The majority points to ORS 757.105(l)(c) as restricting any power the Commissioner may have over advertising to political advertising and then further finds that the statute does not in fact empower the Commissioner to regulate political advertising. I find this discussion beside the point, since ORS 757.110(2) provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1073-6\">\"(2) Nothing in ORS 757.105 or 757.107 prevents the commissioner from at any time making and filing orders rejecting imprudent and unwise expenditures or payments. Such orders when so made shall be in full force and effect, and the public utility shall not have the right to make such expenditures or payments found to be imprudent or unwise until the order has been vacated or set aside in a suit brought and prosecuted as provided in ORS 756.580 to 756.610 or modified or set aside by the commissioner.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1073-7\">Advertising is an expenditure of the regulated industries and the Commissioner is empowered and required to protect customers from unjust expenditures. By requiring taglines, the Commissioner is providing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1020\">*1020</page-number>the customers with the information necessary for them to give him their views about utility advertising expenditure.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It is these views that the Commissioner is required by ORS 756.040 to represent in regulating industries.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-3\">In discussing the \"tagline\u201d rule, the majority cites the <em>Peterson </em>language which states that there is nothing in chapter 689 to authorize regulation by the Board of advertising and concludes that the same is true of those statutes granting power to the Commissioner. 43 Or App 1007. Yet the majority would allow regulation of advertising in the form of the guidelines, because of the Commissioner\u2019s broad rate-making authority. I agree that the Commissioner has broad rate-making authority, \"commensurate with that of the legislature itself.\u201d <em>American Can Co. v. Davis, </em>28 Or App 207, 221, 559 P2d 898 <em>rev den </em>(1977). I read this broad grant of rate-making authority as sweeping enough, particularly when read together with the duties and powers provided for in ORS 756.040, to give the Commissioner the power to provide customers of the regulated industries with information which can assist him in representing customers in the setting of rates and in protecting customers from unreasonable and unjust expenditures. Since I read the Commissioner\u2019s rate-making authority as broad enough to allow for the tagline rule, I find all of the majority\u2019s arguments justifying the \"guidelines\u201d to be equally persuasive as to the \"taglines.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1021\">*1021</page-number>Unlike the Board in <em>Peterson, </em>the Commissioner is not forbidding advertising; nor is he regulating its message as he does to a certain extent through the guidelines. He is merely setting up a mechanism for communication with customers of the regulated industry.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> I am convinced that the legislature intended to thus empower the Commissioner when it admonished him to represent and protect the customer, for this representation of customers appears to be at the heart of the Commissioner\u2019s function; whereas, the Pharmacy Board, at least as it functioned at the time of the <em>Peterson </em>opinion, was largely in the business of licensing and overseeing its competitive profession and did not, nor does it now, have power over a collection of quasi-public, monopolistic industries. The exclusively public function of the Commissioner distinguishes him and his powers in my mind from the Pharmacy Board and its powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-3\">I conclude that the unique authority of the Commissioner, as set forth in ORS chs 756 and 757, more than justifies his promulgation of the tagline rules and sufficiently meets the <em>Peterson </em>requirement that agency regulations must be shown to fall \"within a clearly defined statutory grant of authority.\u201d 244 Or at 123.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> I, therefore, respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1072-9\"> 1965 ORS 689.510 and 689.530.

The Commissioner\u2019s allowances or disallowances of the utility\u2019s advertising expenses for ratemaking purposes sometimes are contested issues and, therefore, are discussed in official rate orders. Only those individual customers who become parties to the administrative proceedings automatically receive copies of the rate orders.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1075-4\"> The Commissioner\u2019s order expressed the following purpose for the tagline regulation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1075-5\">\"The purpose is to provide customers with information.
