Ore-Ida was the employer of Gonzalez, and rake Insurance Company is Ore-Ida\u2019s workers\u2019 com-\u00a1nsation carrier. Gonzalez\u2019 death arose out of and in \u00ede course of his employment. Burzota also sought a \u00a1claratory judgment, alleging that because of her Ipmestic relationship with the decedent at the time of Is death, she was entitled to all of the rights of a Surviving spouse. The trial court granted a summary dgment for defendants in both actions. This is a nsolidated appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\">For plaintiffs to prevail, this court would be required to overrule <em>Huard v. McTeigh, </em>113 Or 279, 232 P 658 (1925). As to that, the words of the trial judge in ese cases are apt:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-5\">\"Although this Court recognizes that public policy and public morals have undergone considerable change since 1925 when the Supreme Court had occasion to construe the statutory provisions of this State relating to the manner of contracting marriage, such construction being that Oregon\u2019s law superseded the common-law rule of contracting marriage, it is not for this Court to attempt to overrule prior case law [of the Supreme Court of Oregon] simply on the basis of a considerable gulf existing between this State\u2019s declarations of policy and the reality of cohabitation and resulting difficulties in this day and age.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">Plaintiffs would also have us interpret \"surviving puse\u201d in ORS 30.020(1)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to include the survivor of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>domestic relationship not sanctioned by the marriage laws of this state.

The action shall be commenced within three years after the occurrence of the injury causing the death of the decedent.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
