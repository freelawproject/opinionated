For the reasons expressed in the unpublished segments of this opinion, we will remand for partial resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">Defendant Danny Hernandez Rodriguez was convicted by a jury of attempted murder (Pen. Code,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u00a7\u00a7 664/187, count I), assault with a deadly weapon (\u00a7 245, subd. (a)(1), count II) , and attempted burglary of a vehicle (\u00a7\u00a7 664/459, count III). With respect to count I, the jury found to be true the special allegation that defendant personally inflicted great bodily injury upon the victim within the meaning of section 12022.7, and the special allegation that defendant personally used a deadly and dangerous weapon within the meaning of section 12022, subdivision (b). In a bifurcated proceeding, the court, sitting without a jury, found to be true the special allegation attached to count I that defendant served two prior separate prison terms within the meaning of section 667.7.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">Defendant was sentenced on count I to life in prison without parole eligibility for 20 years plus a consecutive 1-year enhancement under section 12022, subdivision (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">The findings of the court and jury on the special allegations attached to counts II and III, and the sentences imposed for those counts, are not material to the published issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-8\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b576-9\">The victim, Brigando Hernandez Rangel (Rangel), had been drinking with friends from 11 a.m. until 1 or 2 the following morning. He consumed approximately 12 to 13 beers during that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-10\">When Rangel arrived home at his apartment complex he walked towards the carport area, looking for friends. As he approached the carport, Rangel noticed defendant bent over near a car, with his back to Rangel. The area was darkened. Thinking defendant was a friend, Rangel greeted him. However, Rangel then realized defendant was breaking into a car. Somehow, defendant turned, got behind Rangel, and stabbed him with a knife. Rangel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>pushed defendant away and moved towards the apartments. Defendant pursued Rangel out of the dark carport into a well-lighted area. When defendant was a foot to 18 inches away from Rangel, Rangel turned around, pushed defendant again, an d got a good \u201cface-to-face\u201d look at him in the light. Rangel recognized defendant as being his girlfriend\u2019s cousin whom he had previously met at his girlfriend\u2019s house. Defendant continued to stab Rangel in the back. Ultimately, Rangel managed to stagger to a friend\u2019s apartment, where he collapsed on the kitchen table.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">Rangel was stabbed 17 times. His attacker used two knives, as evidenced by two different sized holes in Rangel\u2019s shirt and jacket.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">When defendant was arrested, one month after the incident, two knives were found under the driver\u2019s seat of the truck defendant was driving. The knives fit the holes in Rangel\u2019s clothing. Rangel picked defendant out of a photo lineup prepared by the police as a part of their investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b577-8\">I. <em>The prosecution was not required by section 667.7 to prove defendant personally committed the violations underlying his prior prison terms.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b577-9\">Having found defendant was a habitual offender pursuant to section 667.7, subdivision (a)(1),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the trial court in part sentenced him on count I to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>life imprisonment, with parole ineligibility for 20 years.  On appeal, defendant contends section 667.7, subdivision (a), required the prosecution to prove he \u201cpersonally\u201d committed the offenses underlying his prior prison terms, i.e., voluntary manslaughter, robbery involving the use of force or a deadly weapon, and assault with a deadly weapon. He maintains the statute does not apply to persons who served prior prison terms for convictions based on their liability as aiders and abettors (\u00a7 31). It is undisputed the prosecution did not introduce any evidence that defendant personally committed the crimes which resulted in his previous incarcerations.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">The pertinent portion of section 667.7, subdivision (a), reads: \u201cAny person convicted of a felony in which the person inflicted great bodily injury ... or personally used force . . . likely to produce great bodily injury, who has served two or more prior separate prison terms . . . for the crime of . . . voluntary manslaughter; . . . robbery involving the use of force or a deadly weapon; . . . [or] assault with a deadly weapon; ... is a habitual offender . . . .\u201d For the reasons which follow, we conclude the Legislature did not intend the statute to apply only to defendants who \u201cpersonally\u201d commit the crimes for which they served prison terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">When statutory language is clear and unambiguous, \u201c \u2018there is no need for construction, and courts should not indulge in it.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Cole </em>(1982) 31 Cal.3d 568, 572 [183 Cal.Rptr. 350, 645 P.2d 1182]; see also <em>Solberg </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 182, 198 [137 Cal.Rptr. 460, 561 P.2d 1148].) The words used in a statute must be accorded their commonly accepted meaning as understood by persons of ordinary intelligence. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Medina </em>(1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 986, 991 [254 Cal.Rptr. 89].)</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">The crucial phrase \u201cwho has served two or more prior separate prison terms . . . <em>for </em>[the specified crimes]\u201d (\u00a7 667.7, subd. (a), italics added) is to our mind perfectly straightforward and comprehensible. Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (1986) page 886 defines \u201cfor\u201d to mean \u201cbecause of\u2019 (usage 8a). Thus, we may read the provision in question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>as: \u201cwho has served two or more prior separate prison terms . . . <em>[because of </em>the specified crimes].\u201d Nothing in these words remotely suggests the defendant had to \u201cpersonally\u201d engage in the conduct constituting the crimes for which prior prison terms were served.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">The content of section 667.7 and related statutes demonstrates the Legislature knows quite well how to limit the application of an enhancement provision to the actor and not the abettor. In section 667.7 itself, the words \u201cperson\u201d and \u201cpersonally\u201d appear. They declare the statute will come into play only if the defendant was the one who inflicted, or used force likely to produce, great bodily injury in connection with the commission of the crime for which he or she is on trial. Similarly, other enhancement laws, such as sections 12022, subdivision (b), 12022.5 and 12022.7, contain the word \u201cpersonally.\" The inclusion of \u201cpersonally\u201d in an enhancement statute expressly reflects the legislators\u2019 desire that direct rather than derivative culpability be a precondition to increasing a sentence. (See discussion in <em>People </em>v. <em>Cole, supra, </em>31 Cal.3d at pp. 573-574, and <em>People </em>v. <em>Reed </em>(1982) 135 Cal.App.3d 149, 152 [185 Cal.Rptr. 169].)</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">Defendant insists the use of \u201cperson\u201d and \u201cpersonally\u201d in one part of section 667.7, subdivision (a), requires the other parts to be construed as if they included those terms. We come to the opposite conclusion. The Legislature\u2019s election not to use accepted words of legal art in the portion of section 667.7 before us is an unequivocal signal the prior convictions need not have resulted from the defendant\u2019s directly culpable conduct.  We see our interpretation as consistent with the general rule that \u201cif a statute is intended to impose a derivative liability on some person other than the actor, there must be some legislative direction that it is to be applied to persons who do not themselves commit the proscribed act.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Walker </em>(1976) 18 Cal.3d 232, 241-242 [133 Cal.Rptr. 520, 555 P.2d 306].)</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">A construction of section 667.7, subdivision (a), in the manner proposed by defendant would in effect insert additional words into the subject clause, so that it read, \u201cwho has served two or more prior separate prison terms . . . for <em>[personally </em>committing] the crime of . . . .\u201d We are unwilling to engage in this sort of judicial legislation in the face of what seems to us to be an utterly clear expression of legislative will.  \u201cThe judicial function is that of interpretation; it does not include the power of amendment under the guise of interpretation.\u201d <em>(West Coast Hotel Co. </em>v. <em>Parrish </em>(1937) 300 U.S. 379, 404 [81 L.Ed. 703, 715, 57 S.Ct. 578, 108 A.L.R. 1330].)</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">In support of his proposed construction, defendant has included in his brief considerable discussion of the legislative history of section 667.7. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>According to defendant, the record establishes that the legislation was never \u201caimed at\u201d individuals who were derivatively liable for their prior offenses. He says the object of the statute is instead to increase the penalties for those who repeatedly and personally commit dangerous offenses. Other than the obvious goal of protecting society from chronic criminals, we find nothing of help in the legislative history on the issue we face here. Thus, \u201cthis is a case for applying the canon of construction of the wag who said, when the legislative history is doubtful, go to the statute.\u201d <em>(Greenwood </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1956) 350 U.S. 366, 374 [100 L.Ed. 412, 419, 76 S.Ct. 410].)</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">Even if the legislative background disclosed an intent to require personal liability for the prior crimes, the legislators failed to carry out this purpose by the words a majority of them chose to use in their final product. We may not ignore the plain and obvious meaning of the statute in order to correct the Legislature\u2019s \u201caim.\u201d (Cf. <em>San Mateo City School Dist. </em>v. <em>Public Employment Relations Bd. </em>(1983) 33 Cal.3d 850, 862-863 [191 Cal.Rptr. 800, 663 P.2d 523].) Our decision will, however, give it the opportunity to improve on its marksmanship if necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">Finally, we do not believe we are in violation of the <em>Walker </em>rule of construction that an absence of explicit language one way or the other in an enhancement statute presents an ambiguity which warrants a narrow construction in favor of the defendant. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Piper </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 471, 477, fn. 5 [229 Cal.Rptr. 125, 722 P.2d 899].) We do not see it as applicable. The wording we construe is descriptive of an individual\u2019s status as a repeat offender, not of his or her conduct. (See <em>In re Foss </em>(1974) 10 Cal.3d 910, 922 [112 Cal.Rptr. 649, 519 P.2d 1073].) Were the terms involved descriptive of conduct rather than status, perhaps we would be inclined to apply the <em>Walker </em>principles. However, in this instance, the plain meaning of the statutory language is apparent; there is no ambiguity. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Cole, supra, </em>31 Cal.3d at p. 572.) Rules of construction exist to resolve doubts, not create them.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">We know of nothing to prohibit the Legislature from requiring the enhancement of a sentence when the convicted person has served a prior prison term for an offense for which he or she was derivatively or vicariously responsible. If one has shown a propensity to assist or encourage others to perpetrate serious felonies, such that he or she is deemed to be equally as culpable as the actor (\u00a731), the Legislature has every right to determine the person should suffer additional punishment when he or she graduates to a higher level of criminal conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>II.-VII.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">The portion of the judgment which imposed sentence on counts II and III is reversed and remanded for resentencing in conformity with the views expressed in this opinion. In all other respects, including the convictions underlying each count and the corresponding findings as to the special allegations, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">Best, Acting P.
