(Kraft), and Dart Industries, Inc. (Dart), formed a new corporation, Dart &amp; Kraft, Inc. (DKI). DKI set up two wholly owned subsidiary corporations which were then merged into Kraft and Dart. As a result, DKI owned Kraft and Dart and all of their assets but Kraft and Dart each continued to operate as separate subsidiaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-8\">As part of the transaction, the Kraft and Dart shareholders converted their respective shares of stock into shares of DKI stock. The former Kraft shareholders became owners of 51.5 percent of DKI stock; the former Dart shareholders received the other 48.5 percent. The DKI board of directors consisted of 13 Kraft nominees and 10 Dart nominees.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-9\">The County of Orange reassessed the Kraft properties located in the City of Buena Park. (Rev. &amp; Tax. Code, \u00a7 64, subd. (c); Cal. Const., art. XIII A.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Kraft paid the taxes but appealed. After exhaustion of its administrative remedies, Kraft filed suit against the County of Orange and the City of Buena Park for a refund.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-10\">Kraft, as well as the county and city acting together as joint defendants, filed summary judgment motions. The defendants prevailed and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-12\">Once again, this court is asked to address section 64 which the Legislature enacted in order to define \u201cchange in ownership\u201d as used in article XIII A, commonly known as Proposition 13. Our focus here is whether subdivision (c) requires reassessment of the Kraft properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1107\">*1107</page-number>Section 64, subdivision (a)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> provides, with certain exceptions set forth, the purchase or transfer of corporate stock is not to be deemed a transfer of the corporation\u2019s property. Thus, the everyday transfer of stock shares does not result in a Proposition 13 reassessment of a corporation\u2019s property. Subdivision (c) of section 64 is one exception to the general rule. It provides that if the transfer of stock shares results in a change of corporate control, a change of ownership of the corporation\u2019s property is deemed to have occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-6\">Application of Section 64, Subdivision (c)</p>\n<p id=\"b917-7\">Kraft contends no change in corporate control occurred. The Kraft shareholders became the majority shareholders of DKI and, therefore, indirectly continued to control Kraft.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-8\">The plain language of section 64, subdivision (c) provides, in essence, that if one corporation either directly or indirectly obtains control over another by the transfer or purchase of stock, a change in ownership of real property occurs. Kraft asks us to ignore this, arguing the merger represents only a change in the <em>form </em>of ownership. Kraft maintains we should look through DKI to the shareholders who still control Kraft.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-9\">The scope of section 64, subdivision (c) was recently considered in <em>Title Ins. &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>County of Riverside </em>(1989) 48 Cal.3d 84 [255 Cal.Rptr. 670, 767 P.2d 1148].<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Justice Mosk, writing for a unanimous Supreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1108\">*1108</page-number>Court, considered whether section 64, subdivision (c) applies when a corporation purchases all the stock of another, but the real property allegedly subject to reassessment is owned by a wholly owned subsidiary of the acquired corporation. Looking to the language of the section, the court found \u201c[t]he fundamental requirement for a change in ownership under the section is the obtaining of <em>control </em>of the corporation that owns the property subject to reassessment, whether that control is obtained directly or indirectly.\u201d (Id<em>., </em>at p. 92.)</p>\n<p id=\"b918-5\">Kraft argues <em>Title Ins. &amp; Trust Co. </em>is distinguishable because Kraft shareholders became the majority shareholders of DKI. Kraft misses the point. The same shareholders did maintain control, but a <em>new </em>corporation obtained <em>direct </em>control. Kraft overlooks the statute\u2019s language which provides for reassessment when a new entity obtains control whether <em>directly or indirectly.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b918-6\">In <em>Sav-on Drugs, Inc. </em>v. <em>County of Orange </em>(1987) 190 Cal.App.3d 1611 [236 Cal.Rptr. 100], this court decided a corporate merger did constitute a change of ownership. The question in <em>Sav-on </em>was whether subdivision (b) or (c) of section 64 applied to the transaction involved. A wholly owned subsidiary of Sav-on owned property allegedly subject to reassessment after Sav-on merged into a subsidiary of Jewel Companies, Inc. The Sav-on shareholders converted their shares into shares of Jewel stock. As a result, the former owners of Sav-on remained corporate shareholders, but only as to a minority interest in Jewel.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-7\">Kraft argues <em>Sav-on </em>compels the conclusion that no change of ownership occurred because the Kraft shareholders obtained <em>majority </em>control of DKI. Kraft has interpreted <em>Sav-on </em>too strictly and has ignored its reasoning. In <em>Sav-on, </em>we did note the Sav-on shareholders became minority shareholders and did not control the merged corporation and its wholly owned subsidiary. (S<em>av-on Drugs, Inc. </em>v. <em>County of Orange, supra, </em>190 Cal.App.3d at p. 1618.) Yet, we found section 64, subdivision (c) applicable because <em>control </em>of the titleholder passed from the acquired corporation to Jewel and its subsidiary. The merger thus fell directly within section 64, subdivision (c). <em>(Id., </em>at p. 1622.) We did not mention again that the Sav-on shareholders lost their majority control, indicating ultimate shareholder control was not the deciding factor. Instead, we quoted the State Board of Equalization rule promulgated to cover the point: \u201cRule 462(j)(4)(A) states a change in ownership occurs \u2018[w]hen any corporation, partnership, other legal entity or any person: . . . (iii) obtains direct or indirect ownership or control of more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1109\">*1109</page-number>than 50 percent of the total ownership interest in any other legal entity . . . [^] all of the property owned directly or indirectly by the acquired legal entity is deemed to have undergone a change in ownership.\u2019 (Cal. Admin. Code, tit. 18, \u00a7462.)\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b919-5\">To accept Kraft\u2019s contentions would be to defeat the Legislature\u2019s express purposes. Proposition 13 directed reassessment of property upon a \u201cchange in ownership,\u201d but did not define that phrase. It is the Legislature which must interpret the electorate\u2019s intent. Section 64, subdivision (c) was enacted as an exception to the general rule of subdivision (a) in order to equalize the tax burden between individual and corporate purchasers of real property. <em>(Title Ins. &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>County of Riverside, supra, </em>48 Cal.3d at p. 95.) Thus, when transfers of stock shares result in a change in control of a corporation, it is considered a change of ownership of corporate property.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-6\">\u201cWhen a constitutional provision has a doubtful or obscure meaning, there is a strong presumption in favor of the Legislature\u2019s interpretation of the provision. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Heckendorn </em>v. <em>City of San Marino </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 481, 488 [229 Cal.Rptr. 324, 723 P.2d 64].) \u201cIf the statute is clear, the \u2018plain meaning\u2019 rule applies; the Legislature is presumed to have meant what it said, and the plain meaning of the language governs. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Pueblos Del Rio South </em>v. <em>City of San Diego, supra, </em>209 Cal.App.3d at p. 904.) Subdivision (c) of section 64 has been held to be \u201ca perfectly reasonable interpretation of article XIII A.\u201d <em>(Sav-on Drugs, Inc. </em>v. <em>County of Orange, supra, </em>190 Cal.App.3d at p. 1622.)</p>\n<p id=\"b919-7\">Kraft contends the \u201cultimate control\u201d theory requires looking through the corporate form to determine which shareholders hold the essential element of control. Under the \u201cultimate control\u201d theory, a change in property ownership occurs if a single shareholder gains majority control of a corporation through purchase of shares. Kraft argues <em>ultimate control </em>is not vested in DKI because it is the former Kraft shareholders who ultimately control the property owned by Kraft.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-8\">Subdivision (a) of section 64 reflects the \u201c \u2018separate entity\u2019 theory, i.e., the notion found in our general law that corporations, partnerships, joint ventures, and associations have an identity apart from that of the owners.\u201d <em>(Sav-on Drugs, Inc. </em>v. <em>County of Orange, supra, </em>190 Cal.App.3d at p. 1620.) Thus, the general rule is that the transfer of corporate stock is not deemed a transfer of the real property of a legal entity because the separate legal entity still owns the property. Section 64, subdivision (c), as an exception to that general rule, reflects the \u201cultimate control\u201d theory, which looks through the title holder to the entity ultimately responsible. <em>(Title Ins. &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>County of Riverside, supra, </em>48 Cal.3d at pp. 89-90, fn. 3.) The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1110\">*1110</page-number>ultimate control theory, however, does not require, as Kraft contends, that we are to ignore all intermediary entities and look only to the shareholders of the parent company which indirectly controls the title-holding subsidiary corporation. The former Kraft shareholders are now merely individual shareholders in DKI; and DKI is the controlling entity.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-4\">\u201cSection 64(c) specifies two means by which a change of ownership may occur. The first is if one corporation, by purchasing stock, obtains direct control of another which owns the property allegedly subject to reassessment.\u201d <em>(Title Ins. &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>County of Riverside, supra, </em>48 Cal.3d at p. 92.) This occurred when DKI acquired the stock of Kraft. The wording of section 64, subdivision (c) clearly applies to Kraft.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b920-5\">IV., V.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b920-6\">Judgment affirmed.

Since the <em>Pueblos </em>court\u2019s focus on section 64 is different from ours, we do not discuss <em>Pueblos </em>any further than to note it lends general support to our position. As the court stated, \u201cWhat is treated as a change of ownership is the situation where any corporation, partnership, other legal entity or any person obtains direct or indirect ownership of more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1108\">*1108</page-number>than 50 percent of the voting stock in a corporation, the total interest in both capital and profits of a partnership, or the total interest in any other legal entity.
