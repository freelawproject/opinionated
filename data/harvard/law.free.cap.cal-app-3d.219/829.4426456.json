(Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11379.) Lee admitted the offense, but defended claiming she was entrapped. Lee contends the judgment should be reversed because she established entrapment as a matter of law. Lee also contends the court erroneously (1) instructed the jury about entrapment and motive; (2) admitted evidence of an uncharged offense; and (3) excluded testimony about the content of a ship\u2019s log. We affirm. Lee did not establish entrapment as a matter of law, and the court properly instructed the jury about entrapment and properly excluded hearsay about a ship\u2019s log. Although the court erroneously admitted evidence of an uncharged offense and should not have instructed on motive, such errors are not prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">In April 1988 Petty Officer Charles J. Ackernecht (Ackernecht) awakened in his barracks and saw Lee, a civilian, selling a \u201cwhite substance\u201d to three other sailors. After concluding the sale, Lee \u201cbrought out a mirror and razors and cut it up into lines. And then they were using dollar bills. And all of them snorted it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">Concerned because \u201c[o]ne person can turn a valve and sink the entire ship,\u201d Ackernecht reported Lee to Naval authorities, who referred him to Naval Investigative Service (N.I.S.) agent Acevedo.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-8\">Ackernecht and Acevedo discussed the incident and he agreed to assist the N.I.S. by reporting any other drug sales he observed. Acevedo instructed Ackernecht about \u201csafety\u201d and \u201centrapment,\u201d telling him not to carry a weapon or be in a situation where he felt obligated to use drugs or ask Lee to do anything illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-9\">Ackernecht saw Lee on two occasions when she was visiting in his barracks. One time Lee asked Ackernecht to drive her home. (No one other than Ackernecht owned a car.) On the way, Lee told Ackernecht she was having \u201cmoney problems.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b697-10\">Perceiving an opportunity to \u201cset up a buy\u201d from Lee\u2019s comment about having \u201cmoney problems,\u201d Ackernecht told Lee he \u201chad friends who party.\u201d Lee responded \u201cthat was a way she could make some money.\u201d Lee discussed \u2019\u2019prices and quantity\u201d\u2014\u201cfour quarters for $100.\u201d Ackernecht never mentioned price or quantity. He never used the words \u201cdrugs,\u201d \u201cmethamphetamine,\u201d or \u201ccrystal.\u201d According to Ackernecht, this discussion in his car was the only time he told Lee he wanted to arrange a drug sale. When Ackernecht and Lee arrived at her home, they agreed to discuss details about the contemplated sale later.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-11\">Ackernecht next saw Lee approximately one week before the sale. Lee was visiting his barracks, gave Ackernecht her telephone number, and told him to call her. When Ackernecht called, Lee told him to pick her up and they would drive together to obtain the drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-12\">Before driving to Lee\u2019s house, Ackernecht met with Shannon Stewart, a N.I.S. agent who would pose as Ackernecht\u2019s friend and buy the drugs. Acevedo had decided Stewart would purchase the drugs \u201cbecause [she] felt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>that [Ackernecht] was clean cut and that it was known that he didn\u2019t do drugs.\u201d Acevedo also notified San Diego police.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">Ackernecht and Stewart drove to Lee\u2019s home. From there Lee directed them to drive to a grocery store parking lot. Enroute, Lee explained she had only been able to purchase three of the four \u201cquarters\u201d and they were driving to a \u201cfriend\u2019s house\u201d to purchase the remaining quarter gram.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">Arriving in the parking lot, Lee sold the three quarters to Stewart, who (at Lee\u2019s request) tendered the entire purchase price ($100) to fund Lee\u2019s purchasing the additional quarter gram. Lee left Ackernecht\u2019s car, walked into an apartment complex, and was gone for 20 to 30 minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">Lee returned to Ackernecht\u2019s car with more methamphetamine. She sold it to Stewart and returned $15, saying she was only going to charge $85 for the four quarters. According to Stewart, Lee said this quarter gram was \u201cfrom a different batch,\u201d \u201cexplained that some of the methamphetamine was made with acetone . . . and some of it has an ether base\u201d and remarked \u201cone of the two, made her break out and the other one didn\u2019t.\u201d Lee snorted some methamphetamine in Ackernecht\u2019s car.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Driving back to the submarine base, Lee told Stewart she could supply drugs for larger purchases with adequate notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-8\">At trial, Lee admitted selling methamphetamine to Stewart. She also admitted being in Ackernecht\u2019s barracks the night he saw her selling drugs, but denied she sold or used drugs, instead claiming Ackernecht was groggy, the room was only lit by candlelight, and any discussion about money concerned sailors collecting money to buy her gasoline to get home. Lee denied <em>ever </em>using drugs, specifically denied snorting methamphetamine in Ackernecht\u2019s car, and denied ever selling drugs other than this one time.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-9\">Explaining why she sold drugs to Stewart, Lee claimed she was entrapped by Ackernecht\u2019s befriending her. According to Lee, Ackernecht \u201casked me repeatedly over and over again to get him some drugs for a friend of his who was going to go get them down on the beach.\u201d Lee testified she was concerned about anyone buying drugs at the \u201cbeach\u201d because a friend of hers \u201chad gotten some drugs down on the beach and it messed her up really bad.\u201d Lee testified she finally capitulated to Ackernecht\u2019s 15 requests for drugs and sold Stewart methamphetamine, apparently out of friendship for Ackernecht, concern for his friend buying \u201cbeach\u201d drugs, and because she was \u201cgetting tired of constantly hearing about it.\u201d Describing the depth of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>their three-week friendship, Lee explained: \u201cHe seemed to kind of like me. I\u2019m a very friendly person and I like to meet new people, especially new military people, so I can get all aspects of the military, seeing how I was going into the military. And he\u2014he was friendly. He initiated conversations about basketball. Couple times we sat there and shot baskets into the trash can.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">The court instructed the jury with, among other instructions, CALJIC<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Nos. 4.60 (1979 3d rev.), 4.61 (1981 rev.) and 4.61.5 (1979 rev.) on entrapment, and 2.51 on motive. The jury found Lee guilty of selling methamphetamine. The court suspended imposing sentence and placed Lee on three years probation including, among other conditions, 90 days\u2019 local custody, consisting of two weekends in county jail and the remainder in the Electronics Surveillance Program.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b699-8\">\n<em>A. Entrapment as a Matter of Law</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b699-9\">In California \u201cthe proper test of entrapment [is whether] the conduct of the law enforcement agent [was] likely to induce a normally law-abiding person to commit the offense[.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Barraza </em>(1979) 23 Cal.3d 675, 689-690 [153 Cal.Rptr. 459, 591 P.2d 947].) Unlike some other jurisdictions, in California entrapment focuses upon police conduct and not the defendant\u2019s predisposition. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Thoi </em>(1989) 213 Cal.App.3d 689, 694 [261 Cal.Rptr. 789].) Under California law, \u201cmatters [such as] the character of the suspect, his predisposition to commit the offense, and his subjective intent are irrelevant.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Barraza, supra, </em>23 Cal.3d at pp. 690-691.)</p>\n<p id=\"b699-10\">Police conduct which only offers the suspect an opportunity to commit crime is not entrapment; however, \u201can appeal by the police that would induce such a person to commit the act because of friendship or sympathy, instead of a desire for personal gain\u201d is entrapment. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Barraza, supra, </em>23 Cal. 3d at pp. 690-691.) Qualifying this statement, the Supreme Court has also stated, \u201cThere will be no entrapment, however, when the official conduct is found to have gone no further than necessary to assure the suspect that he is not being \u2018set up.\u2019 The police remain free to take reasonable, though restrained, steps to gain the confidence of suspects.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at fn. 4.)</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>Entrapment is ordinarily a fact question. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Barraza, supra, </em>23 Cal.3d at p. 691, fn. 6.)  Here, Lee contends she established entrapment as a matter of law because the undisputed evidence shows she sold drugs out of <em>friendship </em>towards Ackernecht.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">An appellate court will only find entrapment as a matter of law where \u201cthe evidence is so compelling and uncontradicted the jury could draw no other reasonable inference.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Thai, supra, </em>213 Cal.App.3d at p. 694.) Here, Lee\u2019s contention fails because there was substantial evidence Lee sold drugs to earn money, not out of friendship. Ackernecht testified Lee agreed to sell his friend drugs to earn money.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">Moreover, even disregarding this evidence, the \u201cfriendship\u201d between Lee and Ackernecht did not rise to the level requiring a conclusion of entrapment as a matter of law. Ackernecht and Lee knew each other for only three weeks. Although Ackernecht was friendly towards Lee, he was never alone with her in the barracks. There is absolutely no suggestion of any sexual relationship or even flirtation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Even Lee describes their relationship in terms which belie any claim of intimacy. Gaining Lee\u2019s confidence by discussing basketball and throwing trash into a wastebasket is not an improper police practice, much less entrapment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-8\">In rejecting Lee\u2019s argument, we acknowledge in <em>Barraza </em>the Supreme Court stated police cannot appeal to \u201cfriendship or sympathy\u201d without having engaged in entrapment. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Barraza, supra, </em>23 Cal.3d at p. 690.) However, on the same page <em>Barraza </em>states, \u201cThe police remain free to take reasonable, though restrained, steps to gain the confidence of suspects. A contrary rule would unduly hamper law enforcement . . . .\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at fn. 4.)</p>\n<p id=\"b700-10\">Lee construes \u201cfriendship\u201d literally and contends she established entrapment as a matter of law because Ackernecht admitted he befriended her to arrange an undercover drug purchase. We disagree with this interpretation. Barraza's \u2019\u2019police remain free\u201d clause modifies its \u201cfriendship or sympathy\u201d phrase. <em>Barraza </em>states the police may \u2019\u2019gain the confidence of suspects\u201d through \u201creasonable, though restrained\u201d steps. There is nothing unrestrained or unreasonable about a submariner, rightfully concerned with his shipmate\u2019s drug use, feigning a three-week casual relationship with a drug <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>seller in which the most intimate moment was spent throwing trash into a wastebasket.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">Friendship ranges a spectrum of depth and emotions. People have \u201cbest friends,\u201d \u201cdear friends,\u201d \u201cclose friends,\u201d \u201cfair-weather friends,\u201d \u201cfriends,\u201d and \u201cacquaintances,\u201d among others. Construing Barraza's proscription against police appeals to \u201cfriendship or sympathy\u201d in context, as we must, the type of casual, brief, non-intimate acquaintance between Lee and Ackernecht shown by the undisputed evidence here is not entrapment as a matter of law, but instead is the type of \u201creasonable, though restrained\u201d steps <em>Barraza </em>permits law enforcement to gain the suspect\u2019s confidence,  <em>Barraza </em>adopted the so-called \u201cobjective\u201d test of entrapment to guard against socially undesirable police \u201cpersuasion, pressure, and cajoling.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Barraza, supra, </em>23 Cal.3d at p. 688.) Consistently with this purpose, in California people need not fear their \u201cfriend\u201d is a police informer and nothing said herein defeats that goal. On this record, however, Lee simply failed to establish the type of \u201cfriendship\u201d needing such protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">In summary, it is the jury\u2019s province to determine the witness\u2019s credibility. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Thoi, supra, </em>213 Cal.App.3d at p. 695.) Here, the jury was entitled to and apparently did reject Lee\u2019s testimony that Ackernecht badgered her into selling him drugs. Instead, the jury apparently believed Ackernecht\u2019s testimony Lee sold drugs to earn money.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Selling drugs to earn money is not entrapment.  Moreover, the undisputed facts show Ackernecht did not appeal to a level of \u201cfriendship\u201d prohibited by <em>Barraza. </em>Accordingly, the court properly submitted the entrapment issue to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">\n<em>B. Jury Instructions\u2014Entrapment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b701-8\">Without objection, the court gave CALJIC Nos. 4.60 (1979 3d rev.), 4.61 (1981 rev.) and 4.61.5 (1979 rev.) regarding entrapment. These instructions define entrapment as conduct that \u201cwould likely induce a normally law-abiding person to commit the crime.\u201d This definition repeats, almost verbatim, the \u201ctest\u201d stated by the Supreme Court in <em>People </em>v. <em>Barraza, supra, </em>23 Cal.3d 675.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>Citing <em>People </em>v. <em>Martinez, supra, </em>157 Cal.App.3d 660, Lee contends these instructions misstate <em>Barraza </em>and require her conviction to be reversed. In <em>Martinez, </em>the court held the phrase \u201cnormally law-abiding person\u201d in these instructions erroneously focuses on the defendant\u2019s character (whether she was predisposed to commit the crime) rather than police conduct. <em>Martinez </em>states the holding in <em>Barraza, </em>adopting an objective standard focusing on police misconduct in determining whether entrapment occurred, would be better effectuated by instructions that do not use the phrase \u201cnormally law-abiding person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">The fundamental problem with Lee\u2019s argument and with Martinez's analysis of the issue is \u201cthe challenged term comes straight from <em>Barraza.\u201d (People </em>v. <em>Kelley </em>(1984) 158 Cal.App.3d 1085, 1096 [205 Cal.Rptr. 283] [rejecting <em>Martinez].) </em>Every published opinion other than <em>Martinez </em>which has addressed this issue has held the challenged CALJIC instructions correctly state the law. These decisions have held the objective test of entrapment is properly expressed by CALJIC Nos. 4.60 (1979 3d rev.), 4.61 (1981 rev.) and 4.61.5 (1979 rev.). <em>(People </em>v. <em>Slatton </em>(1985) 173 Cal.App.3d 487, 491 [219 Cal.Rptr. 70]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Arthurlee </em>(1985) 168 Cal.App.3d 246, 251 [214 Cal.Rptr. 5]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Kelley, supra, </em>158 Cal.App.3d at p. 1097 [\u201cThe language in the instruction is drawn directly from <em>Barraza. </em>[Citation.] To the extent that this language is not consistent with an objective test of entrapment, defendants\u2019 remedy is to seek review in the higher court.\u201d]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Grant </em>(1985) 165 Cal.App.3d 496, 500 [211 Cal.Rptr. 343].)</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">We agree with the weight of authority which has rejected this portion of <em>Martinez.</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Contrary to <em>Martinez's </em>assertion, in context the phrase \u201cnormally law-abiding citizen\u201d does not \u201cstrongly emphasize\u201d the defendant\u2019s predisposition to commit crime. The instructions do not limit the entrapment defense to law-abiding persons. Rather, they focus the jury\u2019s attention on the officer\u2019s conduct in a hypothetical sense\u2014its effect on a \u201cnormally law-abiding person.\u201d This hypothetical is similar to the \u201creasonable person\u201d standard defining negligence in civil cases. Nowhere do any of the challenged instructions require or intimate a defendant who is not \u201cnormally law-abiding\u201d is not entitled to the entrapment defense. To the contrary, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>CALJIC No. 4.61 (1984 rev.), given here, specifically instructs, <em>\u201cSuch matters as the character of the defendant, his predisposition to commit the offense, and his subjective intent are not relevant to the determination of the question of whether entrapment </em>occurred.\u201d (Italics added.) Accordingly, the court properly instructed the jury on entrapment.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">C. <em>Evidence of Uncharged Crime</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Atzo\">\n<footnotemark>\n<em>*</em>\n</footnotemark>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">\n<em>D. Exclusion of Hearsay Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">Ackernecht testified three sailors purchased and ingested drugs with Lee in the barracks on April 29, one of whom was Dane Hunt. Attempting to impeach Ackernecht by showing Hunt was not there, Lee examined Hunt as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-8\">\u201cQ. Okay. Do you recall being in Ernie\u2019s room around midnight on the 29th of April with Dorothy Lee ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-9\">\u201cA. No, I don\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-10\">\u201cQ. Now, do you recall how it is that you know you weren\u2019t there on the 29th of April?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-11\">\u201cA. Yes. I had duty that day.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-12\">\u201cQ. How do you know you had duty on that day?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-13\">\u201cA. On that day we went through our logs\u2014we keep logs in our ship to see when we had duty\u2014we did go through our logs and check. And I did have duty that day.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-14\">\u201cQ. Who went through the logs?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-15\">\u201cA. E.M.T. Sumners.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-16\">\u201cQ. And what would the log reflect\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-17\">\u201c[Prosecutor]: Objection. Hearsay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>\u201cThe Court: Sustained.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">At side bar, Lee asserted Hunt could testify about the content of the ship\u2019s log under the \u201cstate of mind\u201d exception to the hearsay rule. Counsel also implied the question was proper because Hunt refreshed his recollection from the ship\u2019s log.  On appeal, Lee contends the court improperly sustained the objection and the error was prejudicial because the answer would have impeached Ackernecht whose credibility was critical to the success of the People\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">The court properly sustained the objection. Asking Hunt to testify about the content of the log (an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted\u2014that Hunt was not in the barracks because he was on duty) calls for hearsay. The state of mind exception is inapplicable. The log entry reflects Hunt\u2019s state of mind only in the sense that any statement of a past event is a statement of the declarant\u2019s then-existing state of mind\u2014 his memory or belief about the past event. Evidence Code section 1250, subdivision (b), the state of mind exception to the hearsay rule, provides, \u201cThis section does <em>not </em>make admissible evidence of a statement of memory or belief to prove the fact remembered or believed.\u201d (Italics added.) Accordingly, under section 1250, subdivision (b), the state of mind hearsay exception was inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">The court also properly overruled the other asserted ground for admissibility\u2014the document was used to refresh Hunt\u2019s recollection. A witness may refer to hearsay to refresh his recollection; however, before doing so the witness must testify he cannot remember the fact sought to be elicited. (Imwinkelried et al., California Evidentiary Foundations (1988) p. 282.) Hunt did not so testify. Even more fundamentally, where a writing is used to refresh recollection, <em>the adverse party </em>can introduce relevant portions of it into evidence under Evidence Code section 771, but the examining party may not. \u201cThe writing is used by the witness solely to assist him in giving his oral testimony. It has no independent evidentiary value for the party calling him, and \"is not admissible in evidence at his instance.\u201d (3 Witlcin, Cal. Evidence (3d ed. 1986) Introduction by Adverse Party, \u00a7 1835, p. 1792.) In any event, even if the court did err in excluding testimony about the log, any error would be harmless. Hunt contradicted Ackernecht by testifying he was not present when Lee allegedly sold drugs in the barracks, but was instead on duty. Asked, \u201cHow do you know you had duty on that day?\" Hunt responded, \u201cWe went through our logs . . . [a]nd I did have duty that day.\u201d The obvious inference is the log showed Hunt was on duty. Any error in excluding the response to the more specific question, \u201cWhat did the log reflect?\u201d is harmless because the fact the log showed Hunt was on duty came into evidence through a previous question.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>\n<em>E. Instructional Error on Motive</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">Over defense objection, the court instructed the jury with CALJIC No. 2.51 on motive: \u201cMotive is not an element of the crime charged and need not be shown. However, you may consider motive or lack of motive as a circumstance in this case. Presence of motive may tend to establish guilt. Absence of motive may tend to establish innocence. You will therefore give its presence or absence, as the case may be, the weight to which you find it to be entitled.\u201d  Having admitted selling methamphetamine to Stewart\u2014the charged offense\u2014but defending on the basis of entrapment, Lee contends her motive is irrelevant and the court erred in instructing with CALJIC No, 2.51. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">Lee\u2019s trial occurred in November 1988. The Comment to CALJIC No. 2.51 appearing in the <em>January 1987 </em>pocket part to the fourth edition of CALJIC states: \u201cCALJIC 2.51 should not be given where defendant admits the criminal act but claims entrapment as a defense.\u201d This Comment has been continued in the CALJIC\u2019s 1988 fifth edition. The court erred because having admitted the offense and relying on entrapment (in California, an objective standard focusing on police conduct where the defendant\u2019s intent is irrelevant), the defendant\u2019s motive is irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-9\">Where, as here, the court gives a legally correct, but irrelevant, instruction, the error \u201cis usually harmless, having little or no effect \u2018other than to add to the bulk of the charge.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Rollo </em>(1977) 20 Cal.3d 109, 123 [141 Cal.Rptr. 177, 569 P.2d 771], citation omitted.) Attempting to avoid the impact of this rule, citing <em>People </em>v. <em>Martinez, supra, </em>157 Cal.App.3d 660, Lee contends the error is prejudicial. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-10\">In <em>Martinez, </em>the court first held the CALJIC instructions on entrapment were legally incorrect because they improperly focused the jury\u2019s attention on the defendant\u2019s intent and character. With this premise, not surprisingly the court in <em>Martinez </em>found the motive instruction prejudicial because it, too, directed the jury\u2019s attention to the defendant\u2019s state of mind. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Martinez, supra, </em>157 Cal.App.3d at p. 669.)</p>\n<p id=\"b705-11\"><em>Martinez </em>is not controlling on the issue of prejudice flowing from improperly instructing on motive because, as discussed earlier, we follow the weight of authority concluding the CALJIC entrapment instructions accurately state the law by directing the jury\u2019s attention to the effect of law enforcement conduct on a hypothetical normally law-abiding person. Because Martinez's premise is incorrect, its conclusion giving CALJIC No. 2.51 in these circumstances is prejudicial error is also incorrect. Giving CALJIC No. 2.51 was not prejudicially misleading. The court instructed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>the jury to apply the instructions as a whole (CALJIC No. 1.01 (1979 rev.)) and that all instructions were not necessarily applicable (CALJIC No. 17.31). Given the Supreme Court\u2019s statement such errors are \u201cusually harmless,\u201d under these circumstances it is not reasonably probable a result more favorable to Lee would have occurred without CALJIC No. 2.51.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-8\">Benke, Acting P.
