MAYO participated in the disposition of this matter.</judges>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b81-18\">Pursuant to notice, the commission by its duly designated Chief Hearing Examiner, Harold E. Smithers, held a public hearing on this matter in Tallahassee on March 7, 1973.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b82-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>BY THE COMMISSION.</author>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">October 1, 1972, by Chapter 72-374, Laws of Florida, (\u00a7330.45-53, Florida Statutes) the commission obtained regulatory jurisdiction over air carriers in Florida. Those \u201coperating at least one scheduled flight per week as of October 1, 1972, and continuously thereafter\u201d had ninety days in which to file an application for a certificate. This applicant is one of those air carriers who applied for \u201cgrandfather\u201d rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">Shawnee is one of the better known \u201cgrandfather\u201d applicants. Up to December 28, 1972, when the applicant terminated all daily service, it operated many flights between many points in Florida. From that time until April 1, 1973, one special \u201cgrandfather\u201d trip was made each week with the airplane involved staying on the \u201cramp\u201d no more than five minutes. No passengers were transported nor was there any advertising or holding out of scheduled flights. Further, no facilities were maintained at any airport for purposes of serving the traveling public; the whole operation was shut down except for the one circuitous flight which briefly touched down at most of the airports previously served. Shawnee asserts that scheduled service to the public was reinstituted approximately April 1, 1973.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">Thus, it appears that Shawnee has not \u201cbona fide\u201d operated at least one <em>scheduled, </em>flight per week continuously since October 1, 1972. To further complicate the problem of evaluating the evidence, the applicant\u2019s two witnesses were not competent to testify on its behalf since they were no longer corporate officers or employees, and no relationship with the new' owner was established nor does it appear their participation on his behalf w'as authorized. This is particularly true considering a stipulation dated May 21, 1973, received from Shawnee\u2019s \u201cnew'\u201d executive vice president withdrawing its application to fly between city pairs served by protestant Florida Airlines. As the result of that action, Florida Airlines withdrew its protest since it no longer had any interest in the proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">Protestants\u2019 testimony involved generalized statements intending to lead to the conclusion reached above. This type testimony in \u201cgrandfather\u201d applications is not material since the only issue is the \u201cbona fide\u201d nature of the operations, and the applicant has the burden in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-8\">From the foregoing, the commission concludes that the applicant was not in operation in accordance w'ith the law' cited and quoted above.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-9\">It is therefore ordered that the application of Shawnee Airlines, Inc., 1010 Executive Center Drive, Suite 231, Orlando, Florida <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>32803, be and the same is hereby denied.</p>\n<judges id=\"b83-5\">By order of Chairman WILLIAM H. BEVIS, Commissioner WILLIAM T. MAYO and Commissioner PAULA F. HAWKINS, as and constituting the Florida Public Service Commission, this 9th day of August, 1973.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b83-6\"><em>William B.
