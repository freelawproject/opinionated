The United States District Court for the District of Utah dismissed these two follow-on suits for lack of jurisdiction and Plaintiff appeals. Exercising jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, we agree with the dismissals but remand with instructions to dismiss the two suits without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-9\">I. Background<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b498-10\">The genesis of this dispute was an allegedly wrongful arrest of Plaintiff on July 20, 2011. He sued the Weber County Government and numerous other government officials and police officers on several federal-law and state-law claims. The court dismissed some defendants on various grounds, including immunity and qualified immunity, in March 2015.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-11\">Four months later, in July 2015, Plaintiff sued the attorneys who represented the dismissed defendants (the Attorney Defendants), claiming that their assertions of immunity and qualified immunity violated his rights and led to the wrongful dismissal of his claims. According to Plaintiff, Utah and (presumably) all its subdivisions and employees were barred from asserting immunity because of receipt of federal funds under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000d-7. He sought an injunction barring any future assertion of immunity or qualified immunity, \u201cgeneral damages as ... proven at a trial,\u201d and $304 for towing-related fees. R. (16-4201) at 296-97.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-14\">In February 2016, Plaintiff filed suit against Utah and some of its subdivisions (the State Defendants), challenging the assertion of qualified immunity and immunity. He again claimed that their invocations of immunity resulted in the dismissal of his claims. He requested injunctive relief barring the assertions of immunity and one billion dollars in damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-15\">The district court dismissed both complaints for lack of the standing necessary for subject-matter jurisdiction because Plaintiff had not adequately alleged any injury to himself traceable to the Defendants. The court further held that if it had jurisdiction, it would dismiss the complaints because they failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. The district court dismissed both complaints with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">We are not as confident as the district court that Plaintiff lacked standing. To establish standing, a party must \u201cdemonstrate that he has suffered injury in fact, that the injury is fairly traceable to the actions of the defendant, and that the injury will likely be redressed by a favorable decision.\u201d <em>Bennett v. Spear, </em>520 U.S. 154, 162, 117 S.Ct. 1154, 137 L.Ed.2d 281 (1997) (internal quotation marks omitted). Although not a model of clarity, Plaintiffs complaints allege that his prior claims were dismissed because of the improper assertion of immunity by the Defendants. This allegation of injury would seem to be fairly traceable to Defendants, and to be redressable through money damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">But we need not resolve the issue because Plaintiffs claims are not sufficiently colorable to confer jurisdiction. \u201c[A] court may dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction \u201cwhen the claim is so insubstantial, implausible, foreclosed by prior decisions of this Court, or otherwise completely devoid of merit as not to involve a federal controversy....\u2019\u201d <em>McKenzie v. U.S. Citizenship &amp; Immigration Servs., </em>761 F.3d 1149, 1156-57 (10th Cir. 2014) (quoting <em>Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env\u2019t., </em>523 U.S. 83, 89, 118 S.Ct. 1003, 140 L.Ed.2d 210 (1998)). Though Plaintiff casts it in different ways, his entire argument is based on his theory that 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000d-7 bars Utah from invoking any immunity doctrines. That statute states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-10\">A State shall not be immune under the Eleventh Amendment of the Constitution of the United States from suit in Federal court for a violation of section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 [29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 794], title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 [20 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1681 et seq.], the Age Discrimination Act of 1975 [42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 6101 et seq.], title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 [42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2000d et seq.], or the provisions of any other Federal statute prohibiting discrimination by recipients of Federal financial assistance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-11\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000d-7(a). Stretch our imagination as we might, we fail to see in Plaintiffs allegations a basis for any cause of action.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Perhaps he is asserting that \u00a7 2000d-7 creates a federal right whose violation can be remedied under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. <em>See Blessing v. Freestone, </em>520 U.S. 329, 340, 117 S.Ct. 1353, 137 L.Ed.2d 569 (1997) (\u201cIn order to seek redress through \u00a7 1983, ... a plaintiff must assert the violation of a federal <em>right, </em>not merely a violation of federal <em>law.\u201d). </em>But a federal statute cannot create such a right absent rights-creating language. <em>See Gonzaga Univ. v. Doe, </em>536 U.S. 273, 287, 122 S.Ct. 2268, 153 L.Ed.2d 309 (2002) (statutory provisions relied on by Plaintiff \u201cfail to confer enforceable rights\u201d under \u00a7 1983 because they \u201centirely lack the sort of \u2018rights-creating\u2019 language critical to showing the requisite congressional intent to create new rights\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). As the Supreme Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>[W]hether a statutory violation may be enforced through \u00a7 1983.... [requires] determining] whether Congress <em>intended to create a federal right. </em>Thus we have held that the question whether Congress intended to create a private right of action is definitively answered in the negative where a statute by its terms grants no private rights to any identifiable class. For a statute to create such private rights, its text must be phrased in terms of the persons benefited.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 283-84, 122 S.Ct. 2268. (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted). There is nothing close to rights-creating language in \u00a7 2000d-7.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">We therefore hold that the district court lacked jurisdiction over Plaintiffs claims. A dismissal for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, however, should be <em>without </em>prejudice. <em>See Brereton v. Bountiful City Corp., </em>434 F.3d 1213, 1218 (10th Cir. 2006). Thus we REVERSE the district court\u2019s dismissal with prejudice and REMAND with instructions to dismiss Plaintiffs cases without prejudice.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b498-12\"> After examining the briefs and appellate rec- ' ord, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist in the determination of these appeals. <em>See </em>Fed. R. App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G), The cases are therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R. App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1,</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"asf-dedup-0\">. As the district court noted, Plaintiff's complaints and arguments are difficult to follow. <em>See </em>R. (16-4201) at 329 (\"The vast majority of the [complaint] is not factual narrative, but rather is legal argument and conclusions. The facts alleged are limited, vague, and difficult to discern, as they are intertwined with Plaintiff\u2019s oft repeated legal argument and conclusions.\u201d (footnotes omitted)). Although we grant pro se pleadings a \"generous construction,\u201d and read them \"more liberally than those composed by lawyers,\u201d <em>Firstenberg v. City of Santa Fe, N.M., </em>696 F.3d 1018, 1024 (10th Cir. 2012), this generosity \"has limits,\u201d <em>id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b499-7\">.
