The banker\u2019s bond provides coverage for losses caused by an employee\u2019s \u201cdishonest or fraudulent\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1283\">*1283</page-number>acts. The directors and officers liability policy excludes claims for \u201cactive and deliberate dishonesty committed . . . with actual dishonest purpose and intent.\u201d The district court ruled that the exclusion in the liability policy is co-extensive with the coverage provided by the banker\u2019s blanket bond so that, as a matter of law, <em>every </em>loss covered by the banker\u2019s bond is by definition <em>excluded </em>from coverage by the liability policy. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1379-6\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1379-7\">Eglin National Bank sued the Home Indemnity Company to collect on a banker\u2019s blanket bond. Eglin alleged that it suffered a $126,000 loss when its former president, Lewie Tidwell, dishonestly issued two letters of credit without authorization and without following proper bank procedures. Home denied liability, claiming that Tid-well\u2019s acts were not \u201cdishonest or fraudulent\u201d within the meaning of its bond but were merely errors of judgment, bad banking practices, or carelessness.</p>\n<p id=\"b1379-8\">In a third-party complaint against Tid-well, Home alleged that any liability it would have to Eglin would arise out of Tidwell\u2019s acts, so it would be entitled to indemnification from Tidwell. Tidwell\u2019s liability insurance carrier, International Insurance Company, was joined as a defendant, as permitted by Florida law. <em>See Shin-gleton </em>v. <em>Bussey, </em>223 So.2d 713 (Fla.1969). Tidwell denied his acts were dishonest or fraudulent and cross-claimed against International alleging he was entitled to coverage under the terms of his liability policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1379-9\">The district court granted International\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the ground that any \u201cdishonest or fraudulent\u201d act which would cause Home to be liable to the bank would be excluded from coverage by its policy as a matter of law, so that it could not possibly be liable to Home or Tidwell.</p>\n<p id=\"b1379-10\">At the trial on Eglin\u2019s claim against Home, a jury rendered a verdict for Eglin, specifically finding the bank\u2019s loss was caused by Tidwell\u2019s dishonest or fraudulent acts. Judgment was accordingly entered for Eglin against Home and for Home against Tidwell. Home has not appealed the judgment for Eglin. Tidwell appealed from the judgment for Home. Both Home and Tidwell appeal from the summary judgment granted International. Tidwell's brief and argument in this Court, however, have only addressed the summary judgment. Accordingly, Home\u2019s motion to dismiss Tidwell\u2019s appeal against it, carried with the case, is hereby granted for failure to file a brief or otherwise pursue the appeal, pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b1379-12\">Thus, the sole issue on appeal is the summary judgment for International upon which Home and Tidwell are aligned. For simplicity, we will refer to their joint contentions simply as Home\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b1379-13\">\n<em>The Applicable Policy Provisions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1379-14\">The fidelity clause of Home\u2019s banker\u2019s blanket bond provides that Home will indemnify and hold Eglin National Bank harmless for \u201c[l]oss through any dishonest or fraudulent act of any of the Employees\u201d of the bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b1379-15\">International\u2019s directors and officers liability insurance policy insures Tidwell himself (not the bank), for any claims against him for a \u201cWrongful Act.\u201d The policy defines \u201cWrongful Act\u201d as</p>\n<p id=\"b1379-16\">any actual or alleged error or misstatement or misleading statement or act or omission or neglect or breach of duty by the Insureds while acting in their individual or collective capacities, or any matter not excluded by the terms and conditions of this policy claimed against them solely by reason of their being Directors or Officers of the Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b1379-17\">This broad definition standing alone would cover \u201cdishonest or fraudulent\u201d acts as well as negligent and other acts not covered by Home\u2019s policy. An exclusion of the International policy, which is the key to this case, withdraws some of this broad coverage. The exclusion provides that International is not liable for losses in connection with any claims against Tidwell</p>\n<p id=\"b1380-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1284\">*1284</page-number>brought about or contributed to by the dishonesty of [Tidwell], however, notwithstanding the foregoing, [Tidwell] shall be protected under the terms of this policy as to any claims upon which suit may be brought against [him], by reason of any alleged dishonesty on the part of [Tidwell], unless a judgment or other final adjudication thereof adverse to [Tid-well] shall establish that acts of active and deliberate dishonesty committed by [Tidwell] with actual dishonest purpose and intent were material to the cause of action so adjudicated.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ahl-dedup-0\">In other words, International\u2019s policy at first excludes coverage for claims \u201cbrought about or contributed to by the dishonesty\u201d of the insured, but then protects the insured against lawsuits alleging dishonesty unless the final adjudication against him establishes that the outcome rests on \u201cacts of active and deliberate dishonesty committed . with actual dishonest purpose and intent,\u201d in which event the exclusion would be effective.</p>\n<p id=\"b1380-11\">\n<em>Analyzing the Two Policies</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1380-12\">Home contends that the phrase \u201cdishonest or fraudulent act\u201d in its policy is broader than the International exclusion phrase and that Home\u2019s language can include acts which show a want of integrity or breach of trust, not excluded by International. Home argues there <em>must </em>be a difference between \u201cdishonesty\u201d and \u201cactive and deliberate dishonesty,\u201d since even International\u2019s policy apparently differentiates between them, covering the former and excluding the latter. Home therefore argues that International\u2019s policy does not exclude every act Home covers, but rather there is an area of overlapping coverage for acts of dishonesty of a lesser degree than \u201cactive and deliberate.\u201d Because of possible common coverage, it asserts that a factual determination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1285\">*1285</page-number>of the nature of Tidwell\u2019s acts is necessary and that summary judgment was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b1381-5\">The district court held a factual determination unnecessary, deciding that \"if Tid-well\u2019s acts were sufficient to impose liability on Home, they would be excluded from coverage by International. The court found as a matter of law that the standard embodied in the insuring clause in Home\u2019s bond was precisely co-terminous with that in the exclusion clause of International\u2019s policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1381-6\">The present case is apparently the first case in any jurisdiction interpreting this aspect of a directors and officers liability policy.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In construing these two policies in this Diversity case, we apply Florida Law. <em>See Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, </em>304 U.S. 64, 58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188 (1938); <em>Travelers Indemnity Co. v. Holman, </em>330 F.2d 142,151 (5th Cir. 1964). The only case, to our knowledge, to interpret \u201cdishonest or fraudulent\u201d in a banker\u2019s blanket bond or other fidelity bond context as a matter of Florida Law is <em>Glens Falls Indemnity Co. v. National Floor &amp; Supply Co., </em>239 F.2d 412 (5th Cir. 1965). Its interpretation is consistent with many cases in other jurisdictions which have construed \u201cdishonest or fraudulent\u201d in banker\u2019s blanket bonds. <em>See generally </em>13 Couch on Insurance 2d \u00a7\u00a7 46:40-46:42, 46:54-46:59 (Anderson ed. 1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b1381-10\">Fidelity bonds covering losses caused by \u201cdishonest or fraudulent acts\u201d are to be broadly construed, and, as with other insurance contracts, any ambiguity is construed most strongly against the underwriter.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The employee\u2019s acts need not be criminal,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> nor is it necessary that the employee personally benefit nor have intended to benefit from his wrongful conduct.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Nevertheless, as the cases universally recognize, in order for there to be liability on the bond, there must be something more than negligence, mistake, carelessness, or incompetence.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1381-11\">Case law has established that willfulness and an intent to deceive are necessary elements for an employee\u2019s acts to be \u201cdishonest and fraudulent\u201d: \u201cIn order to constitute fraud or dishonesty, it is necessary that the employee have the intent to deceive or cheat the employer.\u201d 13 Couch on Insurance 2d \u00a7 46:55.</p>\n<p id=\"b1381-12\">Thus, in the <em>Glens Falls </em>case, <em>supra, </em>this Court acknowledged that for an act to be \u201cdishonest\u201d within the meaning of a fidelity bond, \u201cthere must exist the <em>element of moral turpitude </em>or want of integrity.\u201d 239 F.2d at 413 (emphasis added), <em>quoting Commercial Banking Corp. v. Indemnity Ins. Co., </em>1 F.R.D. 380, 382 (E.D.Pa.1940). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1286\">*1286</page-number>Court noted a prior Fifth Circuit case had approved a charge defining dishonesty as including \u201cany acts which evinced a <em>want of integrity and an intentional </em>breach of trust.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 414 (emphasis added), <em>quoting United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co. v. Bank of Thorsby, </em>46 F.2d 950, 951 (5th Cir. 1931).</p>\n<p id=\"b1382-4\">The Court in <em>Thorsby </em>said:</p>\n<p id=\"b1382-5\">Any illegal or unauthorized taking or withdrawal of the funds of the bank, <em>intentionally perpetrated by the employee, . . . </em>was a wrongful conversion or abstraction and an act of personal dishonesty which constituted a breach of the bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b1382-7\">46 F.2d at 951-952 (emphasis added). <em>See also Sade v. National Surety Corp., </em>203 F.Supp. 680, 684 (D.D.C.1962) (citing <em>Thors-by </em>for the proposition that \u201cthere must be both \u2018a want of integrity and an intentional breach of trust,\u2019 \u201d that is, \u201ca compelling sense of conscious wrong\u201d is required), <em>aff\u2019d per curiam, </em>114 U.S.App.D.C. 281, 314 F.2d 286 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b1382-8\">Similarly, in <em>Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. v. Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>426 F.2d 729 (5th Cir. 1970), we quoted with approval this language from a Texas Supreme Court opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1382-9\">\u201cTo constitute fraudulent and dishonest conduct, the employee must have some degree of intent to perform the wrongful action. There must be the physical act plus the mental state for there to be fraud.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1382-10\">426 F.2d at 737, <em>quoting, Great American Insurance Co. v. Langdeau, </em>379 S.W.2d 62, 65 (Tex.1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b1382-11\">The necessity of intent was also recognized by the district court in <em>Arlington Trust Co. v. Hawkeye-Security Insurance Co., </em>301 F.Supp. 854 (E.D.Va.1969):</p>\n<p id=\"b1382-12\"><em>An essential element of either fraud or dishonesty is an intent to deceive. </em>Such intent may be inferred from the officer\u2019s reckless disregard.</p>\n<p id=\"b1382-14\"><em>Id. </em>at 858 (emphasis added) (citing, <em>inter alia, </em>this Court\u2019s <em>Glens Falls </em>decision).</p>\n<p id=\"b1382-15\">Home points to several cases which indicate that a fidelity bond\u2019s coverage for \u201cdishonest or fraudulent\u201d acts guarantees fair dealing and integrity by the employee and thus protects against any breach of trust by the employee. An examination of those cases reveals, however, that while such language is used in the opinions, all the cases involved fact situations from which the trier of fact could find that the employee had acted with intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1382-16\">Thus, in <em>London &amp; Lancashire Indemnity Co. v. Peoples National Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>59 F.2d 149 (7th Cir. 1932), the court made this statement as to the law:</p>\n<p id=\"b1382-17\">If it indicates a reckless, willful, and wanton disregard for the interest of the employer \u2014 if it be an act manifestly unfair to the employer and palpably subjects him to likelihood of loss \u2014 a fact question of liability for loss thereby ensuing, as from a dishonest act, is fairly raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b1382-18\"><em>Id. </em>at 152. The facts of that case, however, show that the bank officer knowingly took forged notes from his friend\u2019s bank in an amount five times greater than that bank\u2019s capital and slightly greater than the capital value of his own bank. He extended credit to the other bank even when he had \u201cpositive knowledge\u201d it was in a desperate financial condition. Thus, despite the court\u2019s \u201cmanifestly unfair\u201d language, it is clear the jury could have found willfulness and intent on these facts. <em>See also Citizens State Bank v. Transamerica Insurance Co., </em>452 F.2d 199 (7th Cir. 1971); <em>Irvin Jacobs &amp; Co. v. Fidelity &amp; Deposit Co. of Maryland, </em>202 F.2d 794 (7th Cir. 1953) (both quoting <em>London &amp; Lancashire\u2019s </em>\u201cmanifestly unfair\u201d language in situations showing employee intent to deceive).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1383-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1287\">*1287</page-number>The Eighth Circuit in <em>Fidelity &amp; Deposit Co. of Maryland v. Bates, </em>76 F.2d 160, 171 (8th Cir. 1935), approved this jury instruction:</p>\n<p id=\"b1383-5\">The word \u201cdishonesty\u201d is to be given a broad significance and includes any acts done in breach of the officer\u2019s duty to the bank and any wilful omissions to discharge the duties of his office. It does not embrace mere carelessness or negligence in the discharge of duty, but does include any acts done in violation of the officer\u2019s obligation to faithfully perform the duties of his office, whether such acts be criminal or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b1383-6\">The facts, however, showed intentionally dishonest acts. The bank\u2019s cashier allowed a customer with whom he was in business to overdraw his account. He allowed another customer to overdraw his account and credited that customer\u2019s account for checks drawn on other banks which had not been paid for lack of funds, thus knowingly and \u201cactively aid[ing]\u201d in this check-kiting scheme. The cashier then took steps to conceal his actions. The court said the jury could find \u201cdishonesty\u201d from this evidence. <em>See also First National Bank of Sikeston v. Transamerica Insurance Co., </em>514 F.2d 981, 987 (8th Cir. 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b1383-7\">In <em>Boston Securities, Inc. v. United Bonding Insurance Co., </em>309 F.Supp. 1270 (E.D. Mo.1970), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>441 F.2d 1302 (8th Cir. 1971), the district court found actions that, when considered together with other questionable activity, indicated \u201can intentional course of action to profit personally and to disregard the interests of his employer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1271 \u2014 1272. The Court of Appeals affirmed without discussing whether intent was necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1383-8\">An early case from Texas in this Circuit stated that the banker\u2019s bond guarantees employee honesty:</p>\n<p id=\"b1383-9\">Insurance against dishonest acts is insurance of fidelity; it is intended to, it does, guarantee openness and fair dealing on the part of the bank\u2019s officers. It is intended to, it does, underwrite that the bank\u2019s officers shall act with common honesty and an eye single to its interests. It guarantees that the bank shall at all times have the benefit of the\" unbiased, critical, and disinterested judgment of the president in regard to the loans it makes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1383-12\"><em>Maryland Casualty Co. v. American Trust Co., </em>71 F.2d 137, 138 (5th Cir. 1934). In that case, the bank\u2019s president induced insolvent friends to borrow money from the bank to buy stock in their name but for his use, using the stock as collateral. The president kept the scheme secret from the bank. The court found that \u201c[ujnder the plainest principles of ordinary common honesty and fair dealing, his conduct was dishonest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Despite broad language in the opinion, it is clear that the employee intentionally and deliberately deceived the bank. The case was cited by this Court for just that proposition. <em>See Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>426 F.2d 729, 737 (5th Cir. 1970) (\u201cdeliberate deception by pretense and stealth constitute^] dishonest and fraudulent conduct,\u201d citing <em>Maryland Casualty Co.). </em>Since Texas law now clearly requires intent for recovery for a \u201cdishonest or fraudulent act,\u201d <em>see FDIC v. Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., supra, </em>and <em>Great American Insurance Co. v. Langdeau, </em>379 S.W.2d 62, 65-66 (Tex.1964), the broad language in <em>Maryland Casualty Co. </em>does not reflect the present law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1383-13\">After surveying these cases, we conclude that the broad language in the opinions does not carry the case further than the evidence of intentional acts of misconduct. We thus believe that Florida, in line with the view expressed by Couch on Insurance and the other authorities cited earlier in this opinion, would require willfulness and intent to deceive as essential elements of \u201cdishonest or fraudulent\u201d acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1383-14\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1383-15\">Home, therefore, could only be found liable to Eglin National Bank if a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1288\">*1288</page-number>jury determined that Tidwell\u2019s acts were done willfully and with the intent to deceive the bank. That would provide the adjudication adverse to Tidwell establishing that his acts were \u201cacts of active and deliberate dishonesty committed . . . with actual dishonest purpose and intent\u201d required to bring into play the exclusion clause in International\u2019s directors and officers liability policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1384-5\">We are not persuaded otherwise by Home\u2019s argument based on the juxtaposition of \u201cdishonesty\u201d and \u201cactive and deliberate dishonesty\u201d in International\u2019s exclusion 5(e). International\u2019s policy does not purport to cover some acts of dishonesty and to deny coverage for others. The blanket exclusion in 5(e) for dishonesty-related losses is tempered by the stipulation that International will pay for losses incurred by its insured in defending <em>claims </em>of dishonesty as long as the ultimate judgment does not demonstrate, as a material part of the outcome, that his challenged conduct was, in fact, dishonest. For example, in its definitions section, the policy lists as \u201closses\u201d the costs of investigation and defense of claims. The language of 5(e) ensures that International could not refuse coverage for such costs on the theory that they were incurred in connection with a claim of dishonesty. Nor could International refuse to pay a judgment against Tidwell just because dishonesty was alleged, unless the final judgment showed that Tidwell was in fact dishonest and that the dishonesty was material to the cause of action. Such a judgment was made in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1384-6\">A finding of liability against Home requires a finding of dishonesty because Home\u2019s blanket bond covered only dishonesty. Thus International automatically excludes liability for acts which must be present for recovery against Home. There is no need for a further factual determination as to the nature of Tidwell\u2019s acts. The district court therefore correctly entered summary judgment for International.</p>\n<p id=\"b1384-7\">Home\u2019s motion to dismiss Tidwell\u2019s appeal against it is granted. The summary judgment for International is</p>\n<p id=\"b1384-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1380-4\">. International states that the language of the exclusion clause was \u201cadopted verbatim\u201d by the underwriters from Section 727 of the New York Business Corporation Law (McKinney Supp.1977). That section provides that</p>\n<p id=\"b1380-5\">(b) No insurance [purchased by a corporation to indemnify directors and officers] may provide for any payment, other than cost of defense, to or on behalf of any director or officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1380-6\">(1) if a judgment or other final adjudication adverse to the insured director or officer establishes that his acts of active and deliberate dishonesty were material to the cause of action so adjudicated, or that he personally gained in fact a financial profit or other advantage to which he was not legally entitled, or .</p>\n<p id=\"b1380-7\">The New York statute, however, may have simply taken the language from the underwriters:</p>\n<p id=\"AL1\">The restriction in paragraph (b)(1) [\u00a7 727(b)(1)] essentially enacted into law two of the standard exclusions in the Lloyd\u2019s form of policy (the dishonesty exclusion and the personal profit exclusion) in use at the time [19f&gt;9T section 727 was adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"AxLW\">Johnston, <em>Corporate Indemnification and Liability Insurance for Directors and Officers, </em>33 Bus. Lawyer 1993, 2004-2005 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b1380-8\">In any event, there appears to be no case or legislative history interpreting \u00a7 727(b)(1), so the wording of \u00a7 727 is of no help to us in deciding this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1380-9\">We also note that in 1976, Lloyd\u2019s of London adopted an optional new policy form (\u201cLY-DANDO No. 1\u201d) for its directors and officers liability insurance (which has not yet been adopted by any of the domestic insurers offering this type of insurance coverage). <em>See </em>Hin-sey, <em>The New Lloyd\u2019s Policy Form for Directors and Officers Liability Insurance </em>\u2014 An <em>Analysis, </em>33 Bus. Lawyer 1961 (1978), setting out and analyzing the language of the new policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1380-14\">The dishonesty exclusion in the new Lloyd\u2019s policy employs language simpler and easier to understand. It states that if the underwriter\u2019s own investigation affords reasonable grounds to determine that an exception applies, the underwriter shall not be liable to pay any loss arising from a claim made against the directors or officers</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1380-15\">\u201cbased upon or attributable to their having <em>acted dishonestly, or acted in bad faith with knowledge or with reasonble cause to believe that such action was in violation of law </em>(including for purposes hereof the legal rights of others), <em>provided </em>that such determination should be subject to reversal by a judgment or other final determination in a legal proceeding regarding this Policy to which Underwriters shall be parties.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1380-16\">Policy Section 4(C)(ii), quoted from Hinsey, <em>supra, </em>33 Bus.
