In this case the issue is clearly presented as to whether or not the definition of harm to the environment promulgated by the Executive Branch pursuant to the statute must yield in a particular situation when the evidence shows that no harm in fact resulted to the environment from the spill in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b1454-16\">In this action brought by the United States against defendant Chevron Oil Company to enforce a civil penalty for discharging oil into the navigable waters, the district court granted summary judgment for the Government. We reverse and remand for entry of summary judgment for Chevron. The statutory scheme in question prohibits discharges of \u201charmful quantities\u201d of oil, and the administrative regulations state that any spill that causes a \u201csheen\u201d on the water is harmful. While we hold that the regulation establishing the \u201csheen test\u201d is generally valid, it is invalid as applied to the facts of this case in which .the uncontradicted evidence at the administrative hearing showed that although this spill produced a sheen, it did not have a harmful effect. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1359\">*1359</page-number><em>Statutory Scheme: 33 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1321(b) and the \u201cSheen Test\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1455-5\">The statutory section in question, presently codified at 33 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1321(b), was added by Congress in 1970 as part of the Water Quality Improvement Act of 1970 [Pub.L.No. 91-224, 84 Stat. 91], and amended in 1972 by the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972 [Pub. L.No. 92-500, 86 Stat. 862]. It was most recently amended by the Clean Water Act of 1977 [Pub.L.No. 95-217, 91 Stat. 1593, codified at 33 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1251 <em>et </em>seq.]. Since the changes made by the 1977 Amendment do not affect this case, we will refer in this opinion to the current version of \u00a7 1321(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1455-6\">Section 1321(b)(3) prohibits the discharge of oil <em>\u201cin harmful quantities as determined by the President under\u201d </em>\u00a7 1321(b)(4).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Section 1321(b)(4) instructs the President to issue regulations indicating \u201cthose <em>quantities </em>of oil . . . the discharge of which, at such times, locations, circumstances, and conditions, will be harmful . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1455-17\">Enforcement of these provisions is provided for by \u00a7 1321(b)(6). When a discharge of oil in violation of \u00a7 1321(b)(3) occurs, the Coast Guard may assess the owner, operator, or person in charge of the vessel or facility a civil penalty of up to $5,000, provided that notice and an opportunity for a hearing is provided. 33 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1321(b)(6).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Finally to aid in the detection of oil spills, \u00a7 1321(b)(5) requires any \u201cperson in charge\u201d of a vessel or facility to immediately report any discharge in violation of \u00a7 1321(b)(3) to the appropriate agency. The section also provides criminal penalties for a failure to so notify.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1456-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1360\">*1360</page-number>From this summary of the statutory scheme, it is apparent that the entire regulatory structure of the Act hinges on the term \u201charmful quantities as determined by the President.\u201d The President exercised the authority given him by Congress and determined that \u201cat all times and locations and under all circumstances and conditions,\u201d discharges of oil which cause \u201ca film or sheen upon or discoloration of the surface of the water\u201d are determined to be harmful. 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 110.3 (1977).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Chevron challenges the validity of this regulation known as the \u201csheen test\u201d as applied to the facts of this case in which the uncontra-dicted evidence showed that Chevron\u2019s oil spill caused a sheen but was not \u201charmful.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1456-4\">\n<em>Chevron\u2019s Oil Spill</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1456-5\">The facts concerning this spill were developed at an administrative hearing before the Coast Guard, a transcript of which is in the record, and are not in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1456-6\">Chevron is the owner-operator of an oil and gas producing structure located in Lake Salvadore in St. Charles Parish, Louisiana. This structure stands in about eleven feet of water and is approximately two miles from the nearest shore. A vent or flare pipe is found some 150 feet away. On November 7,1972, a malfunction resulted in the discharge through the vent pipe of approximately one-half to one barrel of crude oil. Since a barrel of crude oil contains 42 gallons, 21 to 42 gallons of oil were spilled.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> A Chevron employee corrected the malfunction and recovered about one-half barrel of the discharged oil which had remained within the casing surrounding the vent pipe. He also noticed a \u201cslight sheen\u201d on the water which he estimated was about 20 feet in width and 50 feet in length. Chevron notified the Coast Guard of the spill as required by \u00a7 1321(b)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b1456-13\">The Coast Guard proposed that Chevron be fined $1,000 for the oil spill pursuant to \u00a7 1321(b)(6). The statutorily guaranteed hearing was held at Chevron\u2019s request. At that hearing, the above facts were elicited from Chevron personnel, and Chevron called Dr. John Mackin as an expert witness. He was accepted by the Coast Guard \u201cas an expert biologist in the field of marine life and marine organisms and as an expert in the effect of oil in such marine life and organisms.\u201d He testified that under the circumstances of the spill as testified to at the hearing, it was his opinion that this spill did not have a harmful effect on the environment of Lake Salvadore, despite the presence of a \u201csheen\u201d upon the water. Dr. Mackin also testified that the toxicity of oil is a function of its concentration, and a sheen does not show quantity or concentration. He felt that the sheen test of 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 110.3 was inappropriate for determining the harmful effects of an oil spill.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1457-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1361\">*1361</page-number>The Government did not produce any evidence at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1457-5\">After the hearing, the Coast Guard confirmed the $1,000 penalty assessment, and Chevron exhausted its administrative remedies. The Government then brought this suit in district court to collect the penalty. 23 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1355. Both sides moved for summary judgment on the basis of the undisputed facts set out above.</p>\n<p id=\"b1457-6\">In addition, over Chevron\u2019s objections, the Government submitted to the district court an affidavit of Kenneth Biglane, the Director of the Division of Oil and Special Materials Control for the Environmental Protection Agency. The affidavit dealt not with the specific facts of the present spill but with the reasons for the sheen test\u2019s adoption. Mr. Biglane stated that \u201csmaller spills [of 10 barrels or less] have a seriously degrading effect on the environment.\u201d He averred that the \u201cenvironmental damage caused by discharges of oil in quantities sufficient to produce a sheen on the surface of the water has been widely recognized,\u201d and he mentioned several scientific studies and reports which supported that statement. Therefore, it was his opinion \u201cthat an oil spill sufficient to produce a film or sheen on the surface of the water is large enough to cause harm to the environment.\u201d Based on this premise and the \u201cenforcement workability of the sheen test,\u201d he concluded that the test \u201cis well suited to define a discharge which damages the environment . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1457-16\">The district court found that the differences of opinion between Chevron\u2019s expert, Dr. Mackin, and those who promulgated the sheen test regulation \u201cwould appear to be inevitable and unavoidable in any determination as subjective as the definition of harmful quantities of oil\u201d and that these differences did not make the regulation un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1362\">*1362</page-number>reasonable or arbitrary. The judge therefore granted summary judgment for the Goyernment, relying primarily on the Ninth Circuit case of <em>United States v. Boyd, </em>491 F.2d 1163 (9th Cir. 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b1458-4\">\n<em>United States v. Boyd and Its Progeny</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1458-5\"><em>Boyd </em>involved a criminal prosecution for failure to report a spill of \u201capproximately thirty gallons\u201d in which the validity of the sheen test was challenged as applied to the \u00a7 1321(b)(5) duty to report harmful discharges. Boyd challenged the sheen test on the ground that it \u201cdefines as \u2018harmful\u2019 a broader class of oil discharges than Congress intended . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1166.</p>\n<p id=\"b1458-6\">The Ninth Circuit upheld the sheen test on the facts of the case before it. It relied on the legislative history and the same Biglane affidavit which was submitted to the district court in the case <em>sub judice. Id. </em>at 1167-1169. One factor which the court found persuasive in the reporting context was the \u201cworkability\u201d and \u201csimplicity\u201d of application of the sheen test:</p>\n<p id=\"b1458-7\">[Ojne salutary aspect of the sheen test is the simplicity of its application. The statute and Regulation read together amount to a clear command to a ship captain: \u201cIf you can see the spill, report it!\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1458-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 1169. The court also relied on Biglane\u2019s conclusion that a discharge large enough to cause a sheen is large enough to cause harm to the environment, noting that this statement was supported by the scientific studies cited in the affidavit and was not refuted by Boyd. <em>Id. </em>The court upheld the sheen test, concluding that \u201c[njothing has been shown, on the facts in this case, to indicate that the Department\u2019s Regulations determining harmfulness go beyond the statutory mandate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1170.</p>\n<p id=\"b1458-11\">Several district courts have upheld the sheen test\u2019s validity as a definition of harmfulness in suits brought by the Government to collect \u00a7 1321(b)(6) civil penalties. <em>See Ward v. Coleman, </em>423 F.Supp. 1352, 1357-1359 (W.D.Okla.1976); <em>United States v. Beatty, Inc., </em>401 F.Supp. 1040, 1043-1044 (W.D.Ky.1975); <em>United States v. Eureka Pipeline Co., </em>401 F.Supp. 934, 942-943 (N.D.W.Va.1975). Those cases rely on <em>Boyd </em>and its reasoning without discussion of any possible distinctions between \u00a7 1321(b)(5) reporting cases and \u00a7 1321(b)(6) penalty cases. In addition, like <em>Boyd, </em>there was no proof in any of these cases that the sheen test might cover <em>de minimis </em>oil spills.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1458-12\">These cases merely followed <em>Boyd </em>without adding anything to it. The present case requires us to analyze <em>Boyd </em>and to determine whether its reasoning is still controlling where there is evidence that the spill was not harmful even though it caused a \u201csheen\u201d on the water.</p>\n<p id=\"b1458-13\"><em>Validity of the Sheen Test as </em>a <em>Basis for Imposing a Civil Penalty for Chevron\u2019s Spill</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1458-14\">Congress could have prohibited <em>all </em>oil spills in the navigable waters of the United States. Indeed, the Senate version of the Water Quality Improvement Act of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1363\">*1363</page-number>1970 prohibited <em>all </em>discharges. <em>See </em>[1970] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News, p. 2691, at 2719. The House version of the bill prohibited only \u201csubstantial\u201d discharges. <em>Id. </em>at 2692-2693, 2700, 2713-2714. The conference committee substituted the present prohibition on \u201charmful quantities as determined by the President.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2722-2723.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> It is clear from this that certain <em>de minimis </em>discharges are not prohibited by \u00a7 1321(b).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Congress delegated to the President the authority to enact regulations to separate these nonprohibited <em>de minimis </em>quantities from prohibited \u201charmful\u201d quantities.</p>\n<p id=\"b1459-5\">Of course, instead of allowing the President to define \u201charmful quantities,\u201d Congress could have enacted the \u201csheen test\u201d as part of \u00a7 1321(b). Had Congress done so, Chevron concedes that the sheen test would have been valid even as applied to the facts of this case. For the reasons given in the Biglane affidavit and in the <em>Boyd </em>opinion, there is a reasonable basis for the sheen test even if the test is somewhat broader than necessary to achieve the congressional objective of prohibiting only harmful oil spills.</p>\n<p id=\"b1459-6\">As a <em>regulation, </em>however, the sheen test cannot be any broader than congressionally authorized. <em>Boyd </em>and its <em>progeny </em>upheld the sheen test because there was no evidence in those cases that the test exceeded the statutory mandate. The court in <em>Boyd </em>refused to hypothesize such a situation in the absence of proof in the record:</p>\n<p id=\"A0m\">Arguing against validity, Boyd asks the Court to judicially notice that not every quantity of oil creating a sheen or discoloration on a water surface is \u201charmful\u201d; that, for example, a single drop is not harmful. Here the prosecution was for a spill of some thirty gallons. The facts in this case, not hypothetical situations, should govern our decision. Even assuming that Boyd might have standing to complain of hypothetical applications of the sheen test, he cannot rely upon judicial notice as to the effect of oil spills. Boyd\u2019s argument is, therefore, speculation, unsupported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b1459-16\">491 F.2d at 1168 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1459-17\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the \u201chypothetical\u201d situation mentioned in <em>Boyd </em>has become a reality. According to the uncontradicted evidence of Chevron\u2019s expert, Dr. Mackin, Chevron\u2019s spill was not harmful despite the fact that it caused a sheen. Thus it would appear that the sheen test as applied to the facts of this case exceeds the scope of the congressionally delegated authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b1459-18\">We need not, however, strike down the regulation. As the court in <em>Boyd </em>found, the sheen test is very workable, and there is a proven scientific connection between a sheen and harmful quantities of oil. The sheen test provides a useful general criterion, but one which will occasionally cover nonprohibited <em>de minimis </em>spills. Any quantification adopted in an area such as this is liable to hit nonharmful spills in certain circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b1459-19\">The solution to the problem can be found in the hearing provided by \u00a7 1321(b)(6). A defendant must be allowed to offer proof at that hearing that its spill was not harmful despite the presence of a sheen. By \u201cnot harmful\u201d we mean only that the quantity of oil spilled was <em>de minimis, not </em>that a harmful quantity was spilled but fortunately did not <em>actually </em>cause any harm.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Because the sheen test provides a generally valid and useful standard, it creates a rebuttable presumption <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1364\">*1364</page-number>that any spill which causes a sheen is \u201charmful\u201d and therefore prohibited by \u00a7 1321(b)(3). Evidence of a sheen thus provides a sufficient basis for the Government to assess the \u00a7 1321(b)(6) civil penalty <em>unless </em>a defendant proves that its spill was not harmful under the circumstances. If a defendant introduces such evidence, as Chevron did here through Dr. Mackin, the Government must rebut with evidence that defendant\u2019s spill was of a harmful quantity under the circumstances.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Since the Government in the case <em>sub judiee </em>did not come forward with any evidence at the administrative hearing, the penalty cannot be enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b1460-4\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded for entry of summary judgment for defendant Chevron.</p>\n<p id=\"b1460-5\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1455-7\">.

[Chevron\u2019s Attorney] Now, I would like to ask you the following question as an expert: Assuming that at approximately 1:15 a. m. on the morning of November 7, 1972, approximately one half to one barrel of oil was spilled into Lake Salvadore from the vent pipe located approximately 150 feet away from the Bayou Villars Tank Battery in Lake Salvadore, the water depth being ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1361\">*1361</page-number>proximately 11 feet and the vent pipe being located approximately two miles from the nearest shore, and assuming that some of the oil was spilled into the casing surrounding the vent pipe, was recovered, and that some of the spilled oil created a sheen upon the waters of Lake Salvadore. Now, based on those assumptions, in your opinion did the oil spilled into Lake Salvadore which created that sheen result in any harmful effect or damage to marine life or to the ecological environment?</p>\n<p id=\"b1457-8\">A. [Dr. Mackin] No, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b1457-9\">Q. Would you explain your answer, please?</p>\n<p id=\"b1457-10\">A. Well, my answer is based upon the experience that I\u2019ve had, the experiments that I have performed and the studies in the field which I have performed in which amounts or concentrations of oil far in excess of that shown to have been lost in this particular spill failed to have any effect whatsoever.</p>\n<p id=\"b1457-11\">Q. Are you saying, Dr. Mackin, that this spill could have been five or ten times as great and there would still have been no damage?</p>\n<p id=\"b1457-12\">A. Yes, sir, it could have been considerably greater.</p>\n<p id=\"b1457-13\">Q. <em>Now, Dr. Mackin, would you agree with the following statement: \u201cWhere a discharge of oil is large enough to cause a film or sheen on the surface of the water it is large enough to cause harm to the environment\"?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1457-14\">\n<em>A. No, sir, I would disagree.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1457-17\">Q. And would you explain your answer, please?</p>\n<p id=\"b1457-18\">A. Well, first I would point out that a <em>sheen is not a quantification. The term \u201csheen \u201d simply means a reflection. It cannot in any way either quantify the oil lost nor can it give any kind of an idea of what the concentration of oil is. The toxicity of oil is a function of its concentration, </em>and without that information the statement is meaningless.</p>\n<p id=\"b1457-19\">Q. You talk about concentration, Dr. Mackin; is it the amount of oil that is spilled or is it the concentration of the oil in a particular area that determines whether or not an oil spill is harmful?</p>\n<p id=\"b1457-20\">A. <em>It definitely is the concentration of oil which has to do with its capacity to do damage.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1457-21\">So, while you can set up on the basis of experiments and the careful measurement of the amounts of oil which you use in experimentation, and you can judge from that what, say, a half barrel of oil would do in a large lake such as Savadore, really in the last analysis after you have eliminated a number of these small amounts as really ridiculous amounts so far as the production of damage is concerned, there is only one way to determine what damage from oil is, and this is to do a study of the biota to determine whether or not damage has been done.</p>\n<p id=\"b1457-22\">[Tr. 26-32, emphasis added].</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1458-9\">. <em>Ward v.

We need not now decide whether the sheen test also creates only a rebuttable presumption in the context of \u00a7 1321(b)(5)\u2019s duty to report harmful spills. While the statutory language is the same, the purpose of the reporting requirement is to enable an expeditious cleanup of the spill rather than to penalize for it, and that might allow the sheen test to serve as an irre-buttable presumption in that context. Since Chevron reported the spill and also concedes the validity of the reporting requirement even on the facts of this case, the sheen test as applied to \u00a7 1321(b)(5)\u2019s reporting requirement is not before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
