When \u00a7 422 <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> stock options given to employees of subsidiary corporations to acquire stock of the parent are exercised, is the difference between the fair market value of the stock and the purchase price a proper charge against the earnings and profits of the subsidiary corporation rather than of the issuing parent corporation?</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-27\">2. In determining whether a \u00a7 301 ordinary corporate distribution constitutes a dividend under \u00a7 316(a)(2) and thus is included in the recipient\u2019s gross income, \u00a7 301(c), are the earnings and profits of the distributing corporation to be determined as of the close of the fiscal year without diminution in the amount of a \u00a7 302(a) redemption distribution made during the year?</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-28\">We answer both questions in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-29\">In a case presenting questions of such difficulty and so ably briefed and orally argued on both sides, we would ordinarily expect, and indeed be expected, to issue a published opinion. After studying the briefs and hearing the oral argument, how<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"954\">*954</page-number>ever, in this \u201crecondite matter,\u201d as counsel for the government aptly described it in oral argument, we find ourselves not only in agreement with, but unable to improve upon, the Tax Court\u2019s analysis of the two issues presented. We therefore affirm the judgment for the reasons stated by the Tax Court in its opinion ruling on these issues, reported at 67 T.C. 522, 543-570 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1049-30\"> This and other references herein are to the Internal Revenue Code, Title 26, U.S.C.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
