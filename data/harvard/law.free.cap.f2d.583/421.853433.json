WRIGHT, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b518-23\">In this appeal by the Montana Commissioner of Campaign Financing and Practices, we affirm the judgment of the district court which held unconstitutional a state statute forbidding corporations or banks from making contributions to promote or defeat any ballot issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-24\">The action by the plaintiff corporations attacks only the constitutionality of the 1975 addition of the words \u201cor ballot issue\u201d to Mont.Rev.Code \u00a7 23 \u2014 4744 (1947). The 1975 amendment legislatively overruled <em>State ex rel. Nybo v. District Court, </em>158 Mont. 429, 492 P.2d 1395 (1972), in which the state supreme court held that prohib\u00ed-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>tions against corporate campaign activities did not apply to ballot issues.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">In July 1976, the Montana Secretary of State certified an Initiative Proposal known as the \u201cNuclear Facility Siting Act,\u201d to be placed on the November 1976 ballot. The appellee corporations<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> asserted that they sought to participate in the campaign involving the initiative and were prohibited from doing so by the statute. They filed an original proceeding in the Supreme Court of Montana seeking declaratory and injunctive relief, complaining that the amendment was unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">The Montana Supreme Court accepted jurisdiction and, after the matter was set for hearing, the Commissioner petitioned for removal to federal court. Because the action arose under the Constitution and, consequently, was within the original jurisdiction of the federal court, removal was granted pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">No evidentiary hearing was held and, after filing of briefs and oral argument, the district court declared the amendment to \u00a7 23-4744 unconstitutional.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">1. <em>Standing.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b519-9\">The appellant originally argued that the appellees lacked standing because, as corporations, they had no First Amendment rights of their own to assert, nor could they assert the First Amendment rights of their shareholders or of the general public. A similar contention was disposed of in <em>First National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, </em>435 U.S. 765, 98 S.Ct. 1407, 55 L.Ed.2d 707 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-10\">In <em>Bellotti, </em>the Supreme Court held that corporations may assert some First Amendment rights on their own behalf. The proper focus, according to the Court, was not the source of the speech which a state seeks to regulate, but whether the speech itself merits First Amendment protection. 98 S.Ct. at 1415. The Court concluded that speech relating to governmental issues is \u201cat the heart of the First Amendment\u2019s protection.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b519-15\">Addressing the justiciability of the issue rather than the question of standing, the Commissioner conceded that, in light of <em>Bel-lotti, </em>the issue was not moot even though the election had already been held. This case, like <em>Bellotti, </em>is among those \u201ccapable of repetition, yet evading review.\u201d The process of completing judicial review will almost always consume more time than the process of voting upon a ballot measure and the measure, like that in <em>Bellotti, </em>is likely to be resubmitted to the electorate. <em>Id. </em>at 1414-15.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-16\">2. <em>Constitutionality.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b519-17\">In <em>Bellotti, </em>the Court found unconstitutional a Massachusetts statute making it unlawful for a corporation to \u201cdirectly or indirectly give, pay, expend or contribute any money or other valuable thing for the purpose of . influencing or affecting the vote on any question submitted to the voters, other than one materially affecting any of the property, business or assets of the corporation.\u201d 98 S.Ct. at 1411-12 n. 2. The statute also stated conclusively that no question concerning taxation would be deemed materially to affect a corporation\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-19\">The Court held that:</p>\n<p id=\"b519-20\">(1) speech which is protected under the First Amendment does not lose its protec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>tion because it comes from a corporate source, and a corporation need not demonstrate that a ballot measure will have a material effect on its business in order to express its views;</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">(2) given the facts presented, the governmental interest in preserving the integrity of the electoral process by preventing undue corporate influence and potential corruption did not justify infringement of a corporation\u2019s right to express its views and the public\u2019s right to free dissemination of information; and</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">(3) similarly, the protection of minority dissenting shareholders did not constitute a sufficient state interest to justify abridgment of a corporation\u2019s First Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">The Commissioner contends that <em>Bellotti </em>is inapplicable because the Montana statute regulates a narrower range of activities than did the Massachusetts statute at issue in <em>Bellotti</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>While the Massachusetts statute forbade a corporation to \u201cdirectly or indirectly give, pay, expend or contribute,\u201d the Montana statute proscribes a corporation's right \u201cto pay or contribute.\u201d Relying upon statutory construction and <em>Buckley v. Valeo, </em>424 U.S. 1, 96 S.Ct. 612, 46 L.Ed.2d 659 (1975), the Commissioner argues that \u00a7 23-A744 proscribes only corporate contributions, not direct expenditures, and there-. fore does not offend against the First Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">The Commissioner\u2019s assertion that the statutes are distinguishable is unpersuasive. As a matter of construction, the common sense meaning of \u201cpay\u201d at least overlaps that of \u201cexpend\u201d and appears to include \u201cdirect speech\u201d such as payments to newspapers for political advertisements as well as payments to political committees and similar organizations.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b520-11\">Furthermore, the Commissioner\u2019s reliance on <em>Buckley </em>is misplaced. In <em>Buckley, </em>the Court held that the provisions of the Federal Election Act of 1972, 2 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 431 <em>et seq., </em>which limited expenditures that could be made by noncandidates \u201crelative to a clearly identified candidate,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 608(e)(1) (Supp. IV 1974), or by the candidate himself, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 608(a)(1) (Supp. IV 1974), were unconstitutional under the First Amendment as direct restraints on political communication.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-12\">The Court went on to hold that regulating the amount that one may contribute to a candidate or campaign organization is constitutionally permissible because it allows symbolic expression of support and only marginally infringes First Amendment rights. The governmental interest in preventing corruption, also raised by the Commissioner here, was deemed sufficient to justify limitations on contributions but insufficient to permit regulation of expenditures.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-13\">As noted in <em>Bellotti, Buckley </em>was concerned with the regulation of contributions and expenditures in partisan election campaigns, 98 S.Ct. at 1422 n. 26. In contrast, the statute here, as in <em>Bellotti, </em>applies to nonpartisan campaigns regarding ballot issues. Although the relevant statute in <em>Bel-lotti </em>forbade both contributions and expenditures by corporations, the Court did not distinguish between the two activities in deciding that the statute was unconstitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>tional. It did, however, draw a clear distinction between ballot issues and partisan elections. The Court pointed out that the purpose of the Federal Corrupt Practices Act, 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 441b, was to prevent corruption of elected officials by limiting their ability to incur political debts, but noted:</p>\n<p id=\"AKsj\">[t]he case before us presents no comparable problem, and our consideration of a corporation\u2019s right to speak on issues of general public interest implies no comparable right in the quite different context of participation in a political campaign for election to public office.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\"><em>Bellotti, </em>98 S.Ct. at 1422 n. 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">The corporations\u2019 rights to express their views on \u201cissues of general public interest\u201d may not be abridged by the state unless a compelling state interest is shown. <em>Bellotti, </em>98 S.Ct. 1420-21. The state interest in preventing corruption of officials, which provided the basis for the Supreme Court\u2019s finding in <em>Buckley </em>that restrictions could permissibly be placed on contributions, is not at issue here. When corporations seek to influence the electorate and not an individual candidate or party, no such state interest exists because corporate activities cannot create political debts of the kind contemplated in <em>Buckley. See Schwartz v. Romnes, </em>495 F.2d 844, 851-53 (2d Cir. 1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">That a corporation\u2019s involvement may influence the vote provides no adequate reason to suppress corporate speech. The Commissioner has not asserted a state interest sufficiently compelling to permit the abridgment of First Amendment rights caused by the prohibitions of \u00a7 23 \u2014 4744.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-8\">The Commissioner also contends, however, that by prohibiting contributions while permitting expenditures, the statute promotes the state\u2019s valid interest in insuring disclosure of the corporate source of political communications. Requiring disclosure of the sources of contributions was approved in <em>Buckley, </em>424 U.S. at 66-68, 96 S.Ct. 612, as the least intrusive means of curbing potential corruption. In <em>Bellotti, </em>the Court, after stating that corporate advertisements may be highly visible in a campaign, noted that</p>\n<p id=\"b521-12\">[identification of the source of advertising may be required as a means of disclosure, so that the people will be able to evaluate the arguments to which they are being subjected.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-13\">98 S.Ct. at 1424 n. 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-14\">The Montana statute goes far beyond the disclosure requirements approved in <em>Buckley </em>and <em>Bellotti. </em>The state\u2019s statutes provide for disclosure of the source of paid political newspaper and periodical advertising and of pamphlets, circulars, and similar materials. Mont.Rev.Code \u00a7\u00a7 23-47-132, 133 (1977).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Additionally, under \u00a7\u00a7 23-4778 and 4779, the contributions to and expenditures by a \u201cpolitical committee\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> must be reported both prior to and after the election.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-15\">Section 23-4744, however, totally prohibits <em>any </em>contributions or payments. It is not minimally regulatory but totally prescriptive and therefore overbroad. Under <em>Bellotti </em>such blanket infringements of First Amendment rights cannot stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-16\">3. <em>Conclusion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b521-17\">The portion of \u00a7 23 \u2014 4744 R.C.M. (1975) which forbids payments or contributions by corporations in support of or opposition to ballot issues is an unconstitutional restriction of corporate First Amendment rights. While regulations to insure disclosure of the source of payments or contributions may be enacted, without a showing of a compelling state interest, the complete suppression of expression created by the Montana statute is overbroad and impermissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b519-11\">. The pertinent part of \u00a7 23-4744 R.C.M., with the 1975 Amendment emphasized, reads:</p>\n<p id=\"b519-13\">No corporation, bank, [utility company, etc.] . shall pay or contribute in order to aid, promote, or prevent the nomination or election of any person, or in order to aid or promote the interests, success, or defeat of any political party, organization, or <em>ballot issue. </em>No person shall solicit or receive such payment or contribution from such corporation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b519-21\">. The district court found that only the power company plaintiffs had a sufficient \u201cpersonal stake\u201d in the nuclear initiative campaign. However, he concluded that there was \u201cinsufficient evidence\u201d on which to be \u201cable to say with certainty that some of the plaintiffs lack standing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b519-22\">Since the plaintiffs sought declaratory relief, the specific interest of a corporation in the initiative was not necessarily determinative.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b519-23\">. Appellees withdrew the request for injunctive relief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b520-8\">. The scope of the political contests to which the prohibition in \u00a7 23 \u2014 4744 applies is broader than that of the Massachusetts statute in <em>Bel-lotti. </em>That statute permitted payment or expenditure by corporation when the ballot issue materially affected their business, except for questions relating to taxation. In contrast, the Montana statute contains no exception to the general prohibition against any corporate payment or contribution related to any ballot issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b520-9\">. The definitions of \u201ccontribution\u201d and \u201cexpenditure\u201d contained in Mont.Rev.Code \u00a7 23-4777 (1975) each include the word \u201cpayment.\u201d The original statute containing definitions, enacted at the same time as the original version of \u00a7 23-4744, treated \u201cexpend\u201d and \u201cpay\u201d essentially as synonyms. Former \u00a7 94 \u2014 1429 R.C.M. (1921). The semantic distinction is far from as clear as the Commissioner urges. We need not wrestle with definitions of the terms, however, because <em>Bellotti </em>establishes that the prohibitions are unconstitutional whether applied to contributions or expenditures.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b521-9\">. The subject matter of these statutes was covered by Mont.Rev.Code \u00a7\u00a7 23 \u2014 1752, 4754 (1975), repealed in 1977.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b521-10\">. Under \u00a7 23-4777, \u201cpolitical committee\u201d is defined as \u201ca combination of two or more individuals, or a person other than an individual, the primary or incidental purpose of which is to support or oppose a candidate or issue or to influence the result of an election by any expenditure.\u201d Mont.Rev.Code \u00a7 23-4777 (1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
