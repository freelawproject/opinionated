Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4161-4166, he was given a mandatory release in October, 1971, for good time earned. In March, 1974, the United States Parole Commission (hereinafter U.S.P.C.) issued a mandatory release violator\u2019s warrant following appellant\u2019s convictions in a Louisiana State Court for possession of heroin and carrying a concealed weapon. Appellant was released in June, 1977, to the custody of the Attorney General pursuant to the violator warrant issued by the U.S.P.C., and reincarcerated in the Atlanta Federal Penitentiary to serve out the remainder of his original sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-13\">The appellant has essentially three contentions, none of which contain significant merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-14\">First, the appellant contends that because he was convicted under a statute<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which does not provide for parole, the U.S. P.C. has no jurisdictional authority to issue a mandatory release violator\u2019s warrant. Therefore, he argues that his reincarceration is illegal insofar as the execution of the warrant caused it. We cannot agree. Title 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4164 provides unequivocally that:</p>\n<p id=\"b273-16\">[a] prisoner having served his term or terms less good-time deductions shall, upon release, <em>be deemed as if released on parole </em>until the expiration of the maximum term or terms for which he was sentenced .....(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-18\">Therefore, even though the appellant was mandatorily released in October, 1971, he still fell under the supervision and control of the U.S.P.C. until April, 1975, 180 days prior to the termination of his ten-year sentence. See e. g. <em>Coronado v. United States Board of Parole, </em>540 F.2d 216, 217\u201418 (5th Cir. 1976); <em>Blanchard v. United States, </em>433 F.2d 13 (5th Cir. 1970), cert. denied, 401 U.S. 959, 91 S.Ct. 989, 28 L.Ed.2d 244 (1971); <em>Garnett v. Blackwell, </em>423 F.2d 1211, 1212 (5th Cir. 1970). Being subject to the supervision and control of the U.S.P.C., it was entirely proper for that authority to issue a violator\u2019s warrant for the violation of a condition of his release, i. e., the conviction of a subsequent state offense for which he was sentenced one to three years. <em>Tirado v. Blackwell, </em>379 F.2d 619, 620 (5th Cir. 1967), cert. denied, 390 U.S. 992, 88 S.Ct. 1186, 19 L.Ed.2d 1301 (1968); <em>Buchanan </em>v. <em>Blackwell, </em>372 F.2d 451, 452 (5th Cir. 1967). Clearly, jurisdiction of the U.S.P.C. over an individual is not dependent upon that individual\u2019s eligibility for parole. Furthermore, it is well settled that once the appellant\u2019s release was revoked because of his violation of its conditions, the U.S.P.C. had the authority to forfeit the appellant\u2019s good-time credit as well as credit for time spent on conditional release. <em>Coronado v. United States, supra </em>at 218; <em>Hemming v. United States Bureau of Prisons, </em>472 F.2d 1221, 1222 (5th Cir. 1973); <em>Smith v. Blackwell, </em>367 F.2d 539, 541 (5th Cir. 1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>Second, the appellant asserts that he was entitled upon release to a \u201ccertificate of discharge,\u201d under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4163. This section, however, provides not for a \u201ccertificate of discharge,\u201d but instead for a \u201ccertificate of deduction.\u201d A \u201ccertificate of deduction\u201d is in essence evidence of permission for a prisoner to serve the balance of his term outside the prison because of good-time allowances. The \u201ccertificate of discharge\u201d provided for in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4210(f) did not exist at the time of the appellant\u2019s mandatory release, and furthermore it can only be issued following the termination of the U.S.P.C. jurisdiction over the offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">Finally, the appellant argues that there has been an <em>ex post facto </em>application of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4210(b)(1). This contention must also fail. The magistrate\u2019s opinion, adopted by the district court, merely referred to that section as additional support for his interpretation that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4164 provides the U.S.P.C. with jurisdiction over prisoners released under that section.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">The decision of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b273-19\">. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4704, 4705.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
