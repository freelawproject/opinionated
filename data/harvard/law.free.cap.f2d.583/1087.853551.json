We cannot, however, consider the letters in isolation, as the respondent would have us do. In its brief, as in its oral argument, the respondent chose to ignore the voluminous evidence concerning intolerably coercive conduct on its part. Remarks uttered or written during campaigns of employee organizations \u201cmay or may not be coercive, depending on the context in which they are uttered. ... In order to derive the true import of these remarks, it is necessary to view the context in which they are made.\u201d 170 NLRB No. 157 (1968). The letters must be related to the whole body of egregious and unfair tactics that the respondent chose to employ. In the light of the Board\u2019s reported Decision, there is no need for us here to review that conduct. Suffice it to say that there was abundant evidentiary support for the Board\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law that necessarily followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-5\">The Petition of the Board is granted, and its Order will be</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-6\">ENFORCED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1184-8\">. The letter given particular emphasis was sent by a company Vice President. The critical portion of this letter reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1184-9\">\u201cIf we ever get organized \u2014 we are required to bargain with that organization. Some people make the mistake that bargaining starts with what you have and goes from there. This is absolutely wrong \u2014 it is a give- and-take proposition. Everyone should understand early in the game that the law permits a Company to bargain from scratch\u2014 from a blank piece of paper. When an A\u2014 T-O Company is organized, it is our policy to do just that.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
