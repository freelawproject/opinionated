First, it is necessary to determine whether certain alleged deficiencies in a pension plan represent \u201cstructural defects\u201d over which a federal court may exercise supervision. Second, we must adjudge the circumstances under which a pension plan may divest beneficiaries of pension eligibility without violating the Taft-Hart-ley requirement that plans be operated for the \u201csole and exclusive benefit\u201d of employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-17\">A. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b179-18\">Edmund Knauss, the appellant, is a retired butcher. Born in 1908, he began work in 1936 for Oswald &amp; Hess Co., a Pittsburgh meat packing firm. His employment with Oswald &amp; Hess continued until the firm\u2019s bankruptcy in 1962.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-19\">In 1957, Local 424 of the Amalgamated Meat Cutters, in cooperation with Oswald &amp; Hess and other meat packers, instituted a multi-employer pension fund pursuant to \u00a7 302(c)(5) of the Taft-Hartley Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Under the terms of the 1957 Fund, participating employers contributed a stipulated amount per year for each employee to fund pension benefits. As an employee of Oswald &amp; Hess, Knauss became a member of the plan, and from 1957 to 1962 payments were made to the pension fund on his behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-20\">The 1957 Fund provided that benefits were to be granted on retirement at age 65 to an employee who had worked a total of twenty or more uninterrupted years for any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>employer contributing to the plan.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This twenty year requisite could be fulfilled (a) by years worked for an employer prior to the commencement of employer contributions to the plan, denominated \u201cpast service credits,\u201d and (b) by employment during which contributions were made, denominated \u201cfuture service credits.\u201d Thus, a portion of the benefits to workers employed at the commencement of the plan may be funded out of payments other than those made on their behalf. However, a break in covered employment of more than one year would cancel all credits for years served before the break, whether those years preceded or followed commencement of employer contributions.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">After Oswald &amp; Hess Co. went bankrupt, Knauss applied to the union hall for work with other employers participating in the Local 424 Plan.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> When he failed to obtain such employment, he left Pittsburgh for the West Coast. After holding several non-union jobs there, Knauss returned to Pittsburgh in 1966. In May, 1966, Knauss found work at the Northside Packing Plant in Pittsburgh, another employer which contributed to the Local 424 Fund. Knauss continued to work at Northside until 1972, when he was laid off.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">In the meantime, on January 12,1970, the Local 424 Fund merged into the Amalgamated Meatcutters\u2019 National Pension Fund (the National Fund). By the terms of the merger, the assets of the Local 424 Plan were transferred to the National Fund and the Local Fund went out of existence. In return, the Local Fund\u2019s beneficiaries became participants in the National Fund. The merger agreement provided that benefits to former participants in the plan of Local 424 would be governed by the National Fund\u2019s standards except that the amount of benefits provided to individuals originally covered by Local 424 would be 75% of those otherwise available to participants in the National Fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-13\">Under the National Fund\u2019s rules, a minimum of ten years of employment with a covered employer was a prerequisite to collecting pension benefits. Like the Local 424 Fund, the National Fund recognized both \u201cpast\u201d and \u201cfuture\u201d service credits to satisfy the prerequisite, but, with some exceptions to be discussed, the National Plan denied credit for employment which occurred prior to a break of more than two years in covered service.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-14\">Upon being laid off by Northside in 1972, Knauss applied to the National Fund for pension benefits. His claim was denied, despite the fact that his employers had contributed to Amalgamated funds on Knauss\u2019 behalf for a total of 11 years, and despite the fact that he had registered a total of 32 years of employment with covered employers. The National Fund\u2019s administrators determined that only the six years of service following his break in employment could be credited to Knauss\u2019 account, and that his remaining twenty-six years of service were to be disregarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-15\">After attempting unsuccessfully to have this decision reversed administratively, Knauss brought suit against the National Fund and its trustees in the district court under \u00a7 302(e)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of the Taft-Hartley Act. He claimed that the provision denying credits for contributions prior to a break in service was arbitrary and capricious, and therefore violated the requirement of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>\u00a7 302(c)(5) that joint employer-union pension plans be operated for the \u201csole and exclusive benefit\u201d of employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">Following a non-jury trial, the district court entered judgment against Knauss. The trial judge determined that he had jurisdiction of the claim under \u00a7 302(e). However, despite a belief that the break-in-service clause was \u201cunfair,\u201d the trial judge held that because there was no proof that the break-in-service provision affected more than a single individual, the unfairness could not constitute a \u201cstructural defect\u201d cognizable under \u00a7 302.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">Knauss then filed a timely appeal. We vacate the judgment and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">B. STRUCTURAL VIOLATION</p>\n<p id=\"AR\">\u00a7 302 of the Taft-Hartley Act prohibits payments to unions by employers. \u00a7 302(c)(5), however, fashions an exception to that prohibition for monies \u201cpaid to a trust fund established ... for the sole and exclusive benefit of the employees of such employer, and their families and dependents,\u201d provided that such a trust fund meets certain statutory requirements.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u00a7 302(e) of the Act affirms that federal district courts have jurisdiction \u201cto restrain violations of this section.\u201d Our first inquiry thus must be whether Knauss has set forth a claim cognizable under \u00a7 302.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-11\">In <em>Associated Contractors v. Laborers Internationa] Union</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>we noted that \u201calthough the extent of jurisdiction under \u00a7 302(e) is not yet settled, this much is certain: a federal court does have jurisdiction under the section to enforce a trust fund\u2019s compliance with the statutory standards set forth in subsection (c)(5) by eliminating those offensive features in the structure or operation of the trust that would cause it to fail to qualify for a (c)(5) exception.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Likewise, in this case we have no occasion to define further the reach of \u00a7 302, for as we said in <em>Nedd v. UMW,</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the allegation of such a \u201cstructural\u201d violation is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>sufficient to vest the court with jurisdiction.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">Here, Knauss alleges that the break-in-service provision of the rules of the National Fund arbitrarily excludes employees from benefits, and therefore does not operate for the sole and exclusive benefit of employees as required by \u00a7 302(c)(5). On its face, such an alleged defect would appear to support an action under \u00a7 302(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">The trustees suggest, however, and the district court held, that a provision of a pension plan which allegedly violates the \u201csole and exclusive benefit\u201d standard does not constitute a \u201cstructural defect\u201d absent proof that a large number of potential beneficiaries are excluded by its operation. Thus, it is argued, since Knauss has not submitted evidence that other workers are also excluded by the operation of the break-in-service clause which he challenges, the provision cannot constitute a \u201cstructural\u201d violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">We note some tension between this argument by the trustees as to jurisdiction, and the trustees\u2019 claim on the merits that the break-in-service clause is necessary to preserve the plan\u2019s actuarial viability. If Knauss were the only individual affected by the clause, the actuarial stability of the pension plan would hardly be augmented by the clause\u2019s existence. If, as the trustees maintain, the clause is actuarially \u201cneees-sary,\u201d a <em>fortiori </em>it must have effects that are broader than simply excluding Knauss.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-9\">In any event, if the break-in-service clause does arbitrarily and without justification bar otherwise eligible workers from pension benefits, it constitutes a \u201cstructural violation\u201d cognizable under \u00a7 302(e), although only a single individual is currently affected. As the Seventh Circuit noted in <em>Johnson v. Botica,</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark><em> </em>there are \u201csome analytic difficulties in the use of the structural deficiency standard.\u201d Nonetheless, the distinction is rooted in the perception that Congress did. not necessarily intend \u00a7 302(e) as a conduit to carry to the federal courts every claim for benefits denied by a \u00a7 302(c)(5) pension fund. Day-to-day discretionary decisions by the administrators of funds are not subject to continuous audit by federal courts. However, where a settled requirement capriciously excludes employees from benefits, it is not the prudence of the plan\u2019s administration which is at issue, but the fairness of its basic structure. Such an exclusion constitutes a failure to conform to the \u201csole and exclusive benefit\u201d requirement, and thus may be reviewed in the federal courts without doing violence to the Congressional intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-10\">While there is language in some opinions asserting that a structural defect is one which excludes \u201c a sizeable number of union members,\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the holdings of the various <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>courts of appeals which have dealt with the issue consistently support the proposition that a settled eligibility prerequisite which is arbitrary and capricious constitutes a \u201cstructural defect,\u201d even if no specific enumeration of the beneficiaries excluded by such a requirement is produced at trial. Thus, for example, in <em>Burroughs v. Board o\u00ed Trustees, </em>the case which contained the language relied on by the trustees, the Ninth Circuit struck down the application of a break-in-service clause to an individual despite the fact that the trial court made no findings<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and the court of appeals adverted to no evidence that the clause affected any employees other than the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">Adopting the reasoning of the trial court, the Ninth Circuit declared that a cognizable violation would be present \u201cWhether the unjust exclusion of <em>a pensioner </em>is obtained from the exclusive provisions of the trust fund itself or from the arbitrary and exclusionary implementation procedures of the trustees . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> This interpretation in <em>Burroughs </em>appears to be a reasonable one. In the case of a generally applicable exclusionary provision, even if only one individual is initially implicated, others who may become eligible in the future are potentially deprived of their rights. There is no justification for holding that the first individual to be arbitrarily denied a pension under a particular provision should be forced to await redress until others are similarly discriminated against.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-12\">We therefore hold that Knauss met the burden of establishing the \u201cstructural\u201d nature of the alleged violation even though he failed to come forward with evidence that others were currently affected by it.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-13\">C. SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE BENEFIT</p>\n<p id=\"b183-14\">Section 302(c)(5) exempts from its prohibition of employer payments to labor unions contributions to pension funds established for the \u201csole and exclusive benefit\u201d of employees and their families. The Taft-Hart-ley Act itself, however, does not define the dimensions of the \u201csole and exclusive benefit\u201d requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-15\">The legislative history of \u00a7 302(c)(5), set forth in <em>Arroyo v. United States,</em><footnotemark><em>14</em></footnotemark><em> </em>indicates that the section was drafted to govern the emerging practice of establishing union-controlled \u201cwelfare funds,\u201d financed by em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>ployer contributions.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Part of the impetus for Congressional concern lay in the potential for \u201ccorruption of collective bargaining through bribery of employee representatives by employers with extortion by employee representatives.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> With equal emphasis, however, Congress wished to safeguard the sums paid into welfare funds \u201crepresenting as they do the value of the services of the union members which could otherwise be paid to the union members in wages\u201d against the abuse of \u201carbitrary dispensation by union officers.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">In recognition of this latter element of the policy nourishing \u00a7 302, courts have held the \u201csole and exclusive benefit\u201d standard to embody a prohibition of arbitrary exclusions from pension benefits.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Thus, for example, in <em>Norton v. IAM Ntl. Pension Fund,</em><footnotemark><em>19</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the court struck down a provision denying pension benefits to an otherwise qualified individual who had been divested of pension rights when his local changed union affiliations, while he retained his original allegiance. The court in <em>Burroughs, supra,</em><footnotemark><em>20</em></footnotemark><em> </em>held that a retroactive application of a length-of-service prerequisite of \u201cemployees . . . who had no notice of its existence and hence no reasonable opportunity to protect themselves from its impact\u201d violated the sole and exclusive benefit requirement. And a series of cases in the District of Columbia Circuit have mandated the grant of benefits that had been denied under a requirement that the last employer of pension applicants be a contributor to the plan, when that requirement applied regardless of the amount of prior contributions made on an employee\u2019s behalf.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b184-11\">Here, the break-in-service clause gives rise to apparently arbitrary distinctions. But for the cancellation effected by his interruption in employment, Knauss had accumulated more than sufficient years of service with contributing packers to entitle him to a pension under the standard established by the National Fund. He therefore would have been entitled to a pension absent the break-in-service provision. Similarly, an employee otherwise identical with Knauss whose lapse in employment occurred from 1953 to 1957, instead of from 1962 to 1966, would obtain benefits under the National Fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-12\">The four-year hiatus barred Knauss\u2019 entitlement notwithstanding the fact that his failure to continue work arose not out of any voluntary abandonment by him of employment with contributing packers, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>from the bankruptcy of Oswald &amp; Hess and from the unavailability of positions with other covered employers. Yet breaks in service are forgiven under the National Plan in the case of employees whose employment lacunae arise because they were self-employed, were union officers, were striking, were transferred to supervisory roles by their employer or worked part-time.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> And had Knauss been 60 years of age instead of 54 when his employer went out of business, he would have been entitled to benefits with no more contributions than those which had already been offered in his behalf.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">Doubts raised by such disparities are exacerbated by the fact that the break-in-service provision causes Knauss to forfeit entirely the eleven years of employer contributions to the fund made on his behalf, contributions greater than those necessary to support a vested right to a pension under the terms of the National Plan. The architects of \u00a7 302(c)(5) understood contributions to a welfare fund to constitute payments in lieu of wages to the fund\u2019s beneficiaries, and sought to ensure that employees whose work generated contributions would obtain the benefit of such funds.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> A prerequisite that divests the employee on whose account contributions were made because of an involuntary break in service, and that distributes those contributions to other employees, seems to be at odds with the Congressional intent in enacting the \u201csole and exclusive benefit\u201d requirement. Indeed, one of the examples adduced by Senator Taft, a principal sponsor of the Act, regarding the difficulties to which \u00a7 302(c)(5) was addressed, arose from a proposed welfare fund for the benefit of members of the local painters\u2019 union in the District of Columbia. Senator Taft commented:</p>\n<p id=\"b185-11\">Painters are notorious drifters. They have something deducted from their wages, and then they drift on to some other city where they may find no fund and lose the money they have already contributed.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b185-12\">The apprehension expressed by Senator Taft that employees will unfairly \u201close\u201d the benefit of contributions made on their behalf is equally applicable when the loss comes about from a formal break-in-service clause. Thus, at least where a break-in-service provision deprives an otherwise eligible employee of all benefits derived from substantial contributions made in his behalf, \u00a7 302(c)(5) requires that the defenders of such provision come forward with substantial justification for the stipulation in terms of the Fund\u2019s legitimate goals.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> We turn therefore to the possible justifications for the clause at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>From an employer\u2019s point of view, a pension plan is like other employment benefits; it is an incentive to worker productivity. It may therefore be that an employer or group of employers will wish to encourage the continuity of its workforce by denying benefits to \u201coccasional\u201d employees. Whatever the merits of this justification in other situations,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> it can have little applicability here, for any incentive to employee loyalty is superfluous in the situation where the employer has gone out of business and no new employment opportunities exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">Rather, the trustees here rely upon the interests of the employees in maintaining the actuarial viability of the pension fund.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Any harshness that results from the break-in-service clause, the defendants claim, is necessary to ensure that the fund continues to serve the majority of the beneficiaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">The only testimony offered by the defendants in support of this position was that of Joseph Barron, an official of the National Fund. Barron\u2019s testimony is far from pellucid. It appears, however, that Barron, who was not qualified as an expert witness, advanced the position that the break-in-service clause was an effort to obtain \u201cconsistent continuous payment for covered employees.\u201d Such continuity in turn was said to be necessary to fund the payment of pension obligations accruing on the basis of \u201cpast service credits\u201d for which no contributions had been made.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b186-13\">As support for the break-in-service clause, Barron\u2019s comments are open to the same objection previously discussed in relation to justification of ensuring loyalty to employers. If, as in Knauss\u2019 case, no jobs are available, the attempt to ensure \u201cconsistent and continuous payment\u201d to finance current, unfunded obligations becomes fruitless. With or without the incentive of the break-in-service clause, the payments cannot be more consistent or continuous than the number of jobs available permits. Indeed, as a general rule, the pension funds that have break-in-service clauses do not apply such clauses where the beneficiary terminates employment involuntarily.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>Despite the fact that the defendants have not adduced persuasive evidence of the actuarial necessity for the break-in-service clause, the trustees suggested in their brief and at oral argument that, at least at the time that Knauss was denied benefits, the break-in-service clause was necessary to the viability of the Plan, and that invalidation of the clause would endanger the availability of benefits to pensioners other than Knauss. We are most reluctant to order the entry of any decree that would threaten the solvency of the National Fund, for the purposes of \u00a7 302 would be ill-served by sacrificing the security of the Plan\u2019s other beneficiaries.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Thus, rather than order a potentially drastic result on the basis of a scanty factual predicate, we will remand this case for the purpose of allowing the trial court to receive additional testimony, to make findings as to the actuarial necessity of the break-in-service clause, and to enter judgment based on those findings.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">The judgment of the district court will be vacated and the case remanded for action in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b179-21\">. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 186(c)(5).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b180-6\">.

Break-in-service clauses subjected to attack under the imperatives of the \u201csole and exclusive benefit\u201d requirement have in a number of cases failed to survive a prohibition on arbitrary and capricious exclusions. <em>See e. g. Lee v. Nesbitt, </em>453 F.2d 1309 (9th Cir. 1972); <em>Burroughs v. Board of Trustees, </em>542 F.2d 1128 (9th Cir. 1976) <em>cert. denied </em>429 U.S. 1096, 97 S.Ct. 1113, 51 L.Ed.2d 543 (1977); <em>Mosley v.

The plaintiff points out that 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1054(b)(3) allows breaks in service to divest previous pension credits only until the employee returns to covered employment and works for a year at such employment, thus implying that permanent divestment is disfavored by federal policy. See <em>Mosley v. National Maritime Union Pension &amp; Welf. Fund. </em>The defendants retort that this provision is rendered inapplicable to breaks occurring before the effective date of ERISA 29 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 1053 b 1 F. They therefore discern a Congressional imprimatur on the applicability of break-in-service provisions before that date. <em>See Lugo v. Employees Retirement Fund, </em>529 F.2d at 255, <em>cert. denied </em>429 U.S. 826, 97 S.Ct. 81, 50 L.Ed. 88 (2d Cir. 1976); <em>Riley </em>v. <em>MEBA Pension Trust, 570 </em>F.2d 406, 413 (2d Cir. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"Al\">Notwithstanding the potential implications which can be drawn from other provisions, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144(d) of ERISA convinces us that we cannot properly rest a decision in this case on either the implications of the Congressional vesting requirement or the failure to make such requirement retroactive. That section reads:</p>\n<p id=\"ai-dedup-0\">Nothing in this subchapter shall be construed to alter, amend, modify, invalidate, impair or supersede any law of the United States . . or any rule or regulation issued under any such law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b186-9\">. <em>Cf. </em>Senator Taft\u2019s remarks <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b186-10\">. Defendants also maintain that it would be improper to saddle the National Fund with liability for benefits greater than that to which the Local 424 fund declared itself subject at the time of the merger. We find this contention unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-11\">The National Fund obtained the assets of the Local 424 fund, including the contributions paid into the Local fund on Knauss\u2019 behalf. If the provision by which these contributions were escheated to the Local Fund clearly violated \u00a7 302, for instance by denying benefits to opponents of the Local president, it could not be argued that the National Fund would be insulated from liability. Moreover, since the eligibility of Local Fund beneficiaries is determined in accordance with National standards under the merger agreement, the issue is the validity of the National break-in-service clause, the possible impropriety of which cannot be attributed to the Local Fund.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b186-15\">. The totality of Barron\u2019s statement on the subject reads as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b186-16\">Well, with respect to multi-employer plans such as this plan, of course, where they provide a credit for past service for which no contribution has been made there becomes an obligation to give future service payments to meet that obligation of the past service plus the future service and this must come out of contributions made by the employer for people who are currently working. Therefore, the Union endeavors to get consistent continuous payment from covered employees until the time that they reach retirement age or an age which they would qualify for retirement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b186-17\">. <em>Lee v. Nesbitt, </em>453 F.2d 1309, 1312 n. 3 (9th Cir. 1972). This aspect also serves to distinguish <em>Foley v. Devaney, </em>528 F.2d 888 (3d Cir. 1976), where this Court enforced a break-in-service clause not covered by \u00a7 302. The clause in <em>Foley </em>exempted breaks in service <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>which occurred on account of the unavailability of covered employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">The decisions in <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Board of Trustees, </em>564 F.2d 1299 (9th Cir. 1977) and <em>Giler v. Board of Trustees, </em>509 F.2d 848 (9th Cir. 1975) also involved break-in-service clauses containing exceptions for involuntary lapses in service.
