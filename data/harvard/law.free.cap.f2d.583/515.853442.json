The facts show that petitioner killed his brother-in-law in his (the petitioner\u2019s) home. He contended that he shot in self-defense. The trial judge, in a confused instruction, told the jury that the defendant had the burden of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>proof as to self-defense and that he had a duty to retreat, if possible, in his own home.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">Appellant was convicted of first degree murder by the jury and sentenced to life imprisonment. The Michigan Court of Appeals vacated the sentence and, under the trial record, resentenced for second degree murder. Petitioner therefore is now serving a 20-40 year sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">His present petition contends that his due process rights were violated by the fact that at the trial the judge placed the burden of proof that the killing was in self-defense upon defendant and, in addition, instructed the jury that defendant at the time of the killing was under a duty to retreat in his own home to the degree he could do so safely. This instruction, he asserts, was in violation of Michigan law, <em>People </em>v. <em>Stallworth, </em>364 Mich. 528, 111 N.W.2d 742 (1961), and federal constitutional law, <em>Mullaney v. Wilbur, </em>421 U.S. 684, 95 S.Ct. 1881, 44 L.Ed.2d 508 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">The facts as revealed in the state court trial of this case were recited as follows in the opinion of the Michigan Court of Appeals:</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">The decedent was defendant\u2019s brother-in-law. Animosity existed between them, arising from the fact that decedent had testified against defendant in a prior criminal trial. Defendant testified that about 9:30 on the night of March 30,1970, decedent came to defendant\u2019s home and said to defendant that decedent had heard that defendant was \u201clooking\u201d to kill him. To this defendant replied, \u201cNo Joe, you\u2019re not worth it.\u201d Defendant then related that shortly thereafter he and decedent went for a ride, settled their differences, and shook hands.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-8\">Defendant returned home and watched TV. He was drowsing about 11:15, when he heard a ruckus at the outside door, and defendant testified that he heard his wife scream, \u201cLook out he\u2019s got a gun or look out, he\u2019s going to kill you.\u201d Defendant said that he grabbed a loaded .22 rifle standing against the wall next to him, stepped through the kitchen door, saw the figure of an unknown man, who appeared to be violent, entering the kitchen. That defendant shot the man and later called the police. Decedent was shot seven times.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-10\">During defendant\u2019s direct testimony, he attempted to relate the statement allegedly made by his wife, \u201cHe is going to kill you.\u201d The prosecutor objected on the basis of hearsay and was sustained. On appeal, defendant asserts this was reversible error because the statement was admissible as a res gestae statement. We agree with defendant that the statement was admissible as a res gestae statement and that it was error to exclude it. We do not agree that the error was reversible error for the reason that the same statement was twice related to the jury, once in a taped statement by defendant and once during his cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-11\">The only persons present at the shooting were defendant, his wife, and decedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-12\"><em>People v. Berrier, </em>48 Mich.App. 454, 456-58, 210 N.W.2d 506, 507 <em>leave to appeal denied, </em>390 Mich. 813 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-13\">There has been exhaustion of state court remedies on the issues with which we are presently concerned. But it is clear that the original appeals in the Michigan court system did not center upon the judge\u2019s instructions which concern us now, perhaps because no objection was made to them by appellant\u2019s counsel at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-14\">The grounds for the grant of the writ of habeas corpus are effectively set forth in the opinion of District Judge John Feikens, dated November 22, 1976:</p>\n<p id=\"b612-15\">Berrier\u2019s allegation is that the trial judge\u2019s instructions to the jury placed upon him the burden of proving his claim of self-defense. This, if shown, amounts to plain constitutional error and warrants the grant of a petition for a writ of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>habeas corpus.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It is well settled that</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">\u201cthe Due Process Clause protects the accused against conviction except upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime with which he is charged.\u201d <em>In re Winship, </em>397 U.S. 358, 364, 90 S.Ct. 1068, 1073, 25 L.Ed.2d 368 (1970). The United States Supreme Court [has] recently considered <em>(Mullaney v. Wilbur, </em>421 U.S. 684, 95 S.Ct. 1881, 44 L.Ed.2d 508 (1975)) a jury instruction which placed upon the defendant the burden of showing by a fair preponderance of the evidence, that he had acted in the heat of passion and, thus,'without malice aforethought when he fatally assaulted the deceased. The court held, \u201cthe Due Process Clause requires the prosecution to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the <em>absence </em>of the heat of passion or sudden provocation when the issue is properly presented in a homicide case.\u201d <em>Mullaney </em>at 705, 95 S.Ct. at 1892 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Similarly, a de-</p>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">fendant should not have to prove the elements of self-defense. Rather, under the <em>Winship </em>standard, the government should be required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the absence of the elements of self-defense.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b613-10\">In Berrier\u2019s case the trial judge instructed the jury as to the elements of self-defense \u2014 that the defendant may not be the aggressor, that the defendant must reasonably believe that he or another under his protection is in danger of death or great bodily harm, and that there must be no way open for the defendant to retreat safely. (Transcript at 557) . He then gave the correct instruction that a person in his own home need not retreat if assaulted. (Transcript at 558) . The judge then went on to say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-13\">\u201cYou are to determine from all of the evidence whether facts constituting such reasonable cause have been established and unless such facts constituting such reasonable cause have been established by the defense in this case you cannot acquit on the ground of self defense . . <em>..\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b613-14\">(Transcript at 559).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-15\">This statement implies that the defendant must prove his claim of self-defense. A short time later the trial judge made this confusing statement:</p>\n<p id=\"b613-16\">Self-defense in proper cases is the right of every person but it will not justify the taking of a human life unless the jurors shall be satisfied from the testimony first that the Defendant was not the aggressor in bringing on the difficulty, that is, that he was without fault; second, that there existed at the time of the striking of the fatal blow in his mind a present and impending necessity to strike such a blow in order to save himself from death or some great bodily harm; third, that there must have been no way open whereby he could have retreated as it appeared to him at the time to a place of safety and thus have avoided the conflict. Unless you find that all three of these facts are established in this case then the plea of self-defense fails. The burden of proof of all such matters <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>is upon the People to show that the respondent is guilty of the offense charged and the People\u2019s testimony must be such as to satisfy the jurors that the killing was not done in self defense. The burden is not on the Defendant who makes the claim of self defense to satisfy the jury of the truth of his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">(Transcript at 560-561).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">Here the trial judge did not instruct the jury that a person in his own home has no duty of retreat, a crucial instruction in this case since the testimony showed that the defendant was in his own home when he killed his brother-in-law. This is error under Michigan law. <em>People v. Lenke-vich, </em>394 Mich. 117, 229 N.W.2d 298 (1975). The judge then went on to imply again that the defendant must establish the elements of self-defense. This mistake is only partially rectified by his final statement relieving the defendant from the burden of satisfying the jury of his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">Jury instructions are to be judged as a whole. <em>Cupp v. Naughten, </em>414 U.S. 141, 94 S.Ct. 396, 38 L.Ed.2d 368 (1973); <em>United States v. Mattucci, </em>502 F.2d 883, 888-9 (6th Cir. 1974). However, instructions must not be such as to mislead the jury; they should be consistent and harmonious. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>United States, </em>230 F.2d 935, 939 (6th Cir. 1956) [\u201cThe fact that one instruction is correct does not cure the error in giving another that is inconsistent with it.\u201d] <em>See also United States v. Reid, </em>517 F.2d 953, 965 (2d Cir. 1975); and cases cited therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">In this case it is clear that the jury was confused when it began deliberations. After it had deliberated for a short time it asked the court to repeat the \u201cthree elements necessary to be present for a self defense decision.\u201d (Transcript at 569). The phrasing of the question indicates that the jury was approaching deliberations with the mistaken assumption that it must decide that the elements of self-defense had been established before returning a not guilty verdict. The trial judge\u2019s answer further misinformed the jury:</p>\n<p id=\"b614-9\">Self defense is, in a proper case, a good defense and the right of every person, but it will not justify the taking of human life unless the jurors are satisfied from the testimony of all three of the following things. First, that the Defendant was without fault, second, that there existed in the Defendant\u2019s mind at the time he fired the weapon a present and impending necessity to shoot the decedent in order to save himself or a member of his family from death or some great bodily harm; and, third, that there must have been no way open whereby he could have retreated as it appeared to him at the time to a place of safety and thus have avoided the conflict.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-10\">Although the trial judge admonished the jury that this answer was to be taken in conjunction with all of the instructions (Transcript at 571), it is clear that the answer emphasized the erroneous instructions given earlier, repeating the wrong instruction on duty of retreat and again placing upon the defendant the burden of establishing his claim of self-defense. This removes any possibility that the error could be considered harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See Mullaney, </em>421 U.S. at 705, 95 S.Ct. 1881 (Rehnquist, J., concurring); <em>Chapman v. California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-11\">The court concludes that the trial judge\u2019s instructions on the issue of self-defense denied due process to the defendant and rendered his trial fundamentally unfair in a constitutional sense. Since this conclusion is dispositive of Berrier\u2019s petition, the court declines to consider any of his other allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-12\"><em>Perrier v. Egeler, </em>428 F.Supp. 750, 752-54 (E.D.Mich. 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-13\">On review of the appellate record before us, we conclude that appellant\u2019s federal due <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>process rights were violated by failure to place the burden of proof upon the state as to appellant\u2019s self-defense theory. <em>Mulla-ney v. Wilbur, </em>421 U.S. 684, 95 S.Ct. 1881, 44 L.Ed.2d 508 (1975); <em>In re Winship, </em>397 U.S. 358, 90 S.Ct. 1068, 25 L.Ed.2d 368 (1970). <em>See also People v. Stallworth, </em>364 Mich. 528, 111 N.W.2d 742 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">Nor do we find any conflict between the District Judge\u2019s opinion and more recent Supreme Court cases such as <em>Patterson v. New York, </em>432 U.S. 197, 97 S.Ct. 2319, 53 L.Ed.2d 281 (1977), and <em>Wainwright </em>v. <em>Sykes, </em>433 U.S. 72, 97 S.Ct. 2497, 53 L.Ed.2d 594 (1977). In <em>Patterson </em>the Court\u2019s opinion clearly recognizes that \u201ca state must prove every ingredient of an offense beyond a reasonable doubt, and that it may not shift the burden of proof to the defendant by presuming that ingredient upon proof of the other elements of the offense.\u201d <em>Patterson v. New York, supra, </em>432 U.S. at 215, 97 S.Ct. at 2330.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">Although there is general language in the trial judge\u2019s charge in this case placing the burden of proof upon the prosecution to establish guilt beyond reasonable doubt, a major portion of the charge consisted of the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">While I will instruct you further on this point, I will add at this point, so there is no misunderstanding, that, that as the second element of self defense which I have just discussed, that is in the Defendant\u2019s mind there must be a present and impending necessity to shoot the Defendant in order to save himself from death or some great bodily harm. This extends also to protect members of his family toward whom he owes a duty of such protection in a proper case where that is shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">The right to defend one\u2019s self against danger not of his own seeking, which is a right which the law guarantees to all men and the same right which exists to protect himself, exists also for those depending upon him such as members of his family. In this case the Defendant had the same right to protect his wife or family that he would have had to protect himself in a like situation, though the danger was threatened to his wife, his family or unto himself, if at the time the Defendant shot the deceased, he had reasonable cause to apprehend on the part of the deceased a design to do to himself or to his family great personal injury, and there was reasonable cause for him to apprehend immediate danger of such design being accomplished and to avert such apprehended danger he shot and at the time he did so he had reasonable cause to believe it necessary for him to shoot in the way he did to protect himself and/or his wife and family from such apprehended danger, then and in that case, the shooting was not felonious but was justifiable and you ought to acquit him on the grounds of necessary self defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-10\">It is not necessary to this defense that the danger should have been actual or real or that the danger should have been impending and immediately about to follow. All that is necessary is that the Defendant had reasonable cause to believe and did believe these facts, but before you acquit on the ground of self defense you ought to believe that the Defendant because of apprehension for himself and/or his family was reasonable. You are to determine from all of the evidence whether facts constituting such reasonable cause have been established and unless such facts constituting such reasonable cause have been established by the defense in this case you cannot acquit on the ground of self defense, but his actions and conduct are to be judged from the circumstances as they appeared to him at that time and if from all the evidence in the case there exists in your mind a reasonable doubt whether the respondent did not in fact kill Joseph Mato-lovich in defense of himself and/or his wife or family, honestly believing his life and/or the life of his wife and family was in jeopardy or that he was in danger of receiving serious bodily injury at the hands of Joseph Matolovich, then it would be your duty to render a verdict of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>not guilty. It is not necessary to his defense that the danger should have been actual or real, or that the danger should have been impending and immediately about to follow, the actions and conduct of the respondent are to be judged from the circumstances as they appeared to him at the time. One who is suddenly attacked by an adversary is not held to fine distinctions of judgment as to what is in the mind of his adversary or what is his adversary is about to do or to how much force it is necessary for him to use to protect his life or his person from serious harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">In justification of the offense here charged against him, the respondent has interposed a plea of self defense and under certain circumstances this is a good defense. To make the plea available it must appear that the respondent was without fault on his part, if he himself was the aggressor in the conflict he cannot invoke the doctrine of self defense as an excuse for the killing unless he was at that time in immediate danger of loss of his own life or suffering some grievous bodily injury and there was no retreat open to him and his only safety lay in striking the blow which caused the death of the deceased.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">Perhaps even more important is the fact that when the jury in the course of its deliberations sent a note to the judge requesting instructions upon \u201cthree elements necessary to be present for a self-defense decision,\u201d the record discloses that the trial judge failed to indicate that the burden of proof on the self-defense issue was on the prosecution and repeated a previously erroneous instruction on the duty to retreat:</p>\n<p id=\"age-dedup-0\">THE COURT: Thank you. The record may so indicate. Ladies and gentlemen, I have a note that you handed to the bailiff for my attention which reads as follows: Three elements necessary to be present for a self defense decision. I will rein-struct you on this point since you will have to depend on this verbal instruction, I will ask you to listen carefully.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">Self defense is, in a proper case, a good defense and the right of every person, but it will not justify the taking of human life unless the jurors are satisfied from the testimony of all three of the following things. First, that the Defendant was without fault, second, that there existed in the Defendant\u2019s mind at the time he fired the weapon a present and impending necessity to shoot the decedent in order to save himself or a member of his family from death or some great bodily harm; and, third, that there must have been no way open whereby he could have retreated as it appeared to him at the time to a place of safety and thus have avoided the conflict. I will read that again for you.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">Self defense is, in a proper case, a good defense and the right of every person, but it will not justify the taking of human life unless the jurors are satisfied from the testimony of all three of the following things. First, that the Defendant was without fault; secondly, that there existed in the Defendant\u2019s mind at the time he fired the weapon, a present and impending necessity to shoot the decedent in order to save himself or a member of his family from death or some great bodily harm; and third, that there must have been no way open whereby he could have retreated as it appeared to him at the time, to a place of safety and thus avoided the conflict.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-8\">I trust this will be of assistance to you. The jury is excused in company with the bailiff. You may retire to the jury deliberation room.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-9\">(Jury left the Courtroom at 5:13).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-10\">THE COURT: I will ask Counsel if they are satisfied with the additional instructions which the Court has just given the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-11\">Neither counsel entered any objection to the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-12\">We recognize that appellee Berrier emphasizes that Michigan law does not impose a duty to retreat upon one who is threat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>ened in his own home. <em>People v. Lenkev-itch, </em>394 Mich. 117, 229 N.W.2d 298 (1975); <em>People v. Stallworth, </em>364 Mich. 528, 535, 111 N.W.2d 742, 746 (1961); <em>People v. Johnson, </em>75 Mich.App. 337, 254 N.W.2d 667 (1977). It, however, is by no means clear that this aspect of the trial judge\u2019s failure to give a proper instruction would be held to be a federal due process violation in a habeas corpus case. <em>See Henderson v. Kibbe, </em>431 U.S. 145, 154, 97 S.Ct. 1730, 52 L.Ed.2d 203 (1977). As a consequence, we place no reliance upon this clear error in application of Michigan law in our affirmance of the issuance of the writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">Under Michigan law proof of the absence of grounds for self-defense is an element of the crime of murder upon which the prosecution must bear the burden of proof.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This has been true for many years. One of the clearest statements is found in the leading Michigan case of <em>People </em>v. <em>Coughlin, </em>65 Mich. 704, 32 N.W. 905 (1887), where the Supreme Court of Michigan said:</p>\n<p id=\"A71\">CHAMPLIN, J. Respondent was convicted of manslaughter, and sentenced to be confined in the state prison at Jackson at hard labor for the period of 13 years. The circuit judge charged the jury that, in cases where the respondent seeks to justify his acts of killing as done in self-defense, the burden of proof is upon himself to establish the killing to have been done in self-defense. This was error. In civil cases the burden of proof is generally upon the party who affirms the existence of facts necessary to make out his case. In criminal cases, however, the burden of proof is upon the prosecutor to show that the accused is guilty of the offense charged. The charge made against respondent in this case <em>could not be made out </em>unless the testimony should exclude the idea of self-defense beyond a reasonable doubt. Consequently it was incumbent upon the people to show such facts and circumstances as convinced the jury that the killing was not done in self-defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-4\"><em>People v. Coughlin, supra </em>at 705, 32 N.W. at 905 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">It is perfectly clear, of course, that appellee Berrier in his state court trial did seek \u201cto justify his acts of killing as done in self-defense,\u201d and hence, the burden of proof was upon the prosecution to show that \u201cthe killing was not done in self-defense.\u201d The Michigan Supreme Court has adhered to this principle without deviation through a long line of cases: <em>People v. Cathey, </em>220 Mich. 628, 631-32, 190 N.W. 753 (1922); <em>People v. Asbury, </em>257 Mich. 297, 298-99, 241 N.W. 144 (1932); <em>People v. Stallworth, </em>364 Mich. 528, 535, 111 N.W.2d 742 (1961); <em>People </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>390 Mich. 621, 626, 212 N.W.2d 918 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-8\">We entertain no doubt that as a matter of federal due process the prosecution must prove beyond reasonable doubt every fact necessary to constitute the crime charged. <em>In re Winship, </em>397 U.S. 358, 364, 90 S.Ct. 1068, 25 L.Ed.2d 368 (1970); <em>Mullaney v. Wilbur, </em>421 U.S. 684, 95 S.Ct. 1881, 44 L.Ed.2d 508 (1975); <em>Patterson v. New York, </em>432 U.S. 197, 206, 97 S.Ct. 2319, 53 L.Ed.2d 281 (1977). In Michigan an element of proof of murder is evidence which negates self-defense, in any case where self-defense is claimed and evidence is offered thereon. <em>See </em>citations in paragraph above. In this posture of the case, we believe that the District Court and this court are controlled by the Fourteenth Amendment as it has been interpreted by the Supreme Court of the United States in <em>In re Winship, supra, Patterson, supra, </em>and <em>Mullaney v. Wilbur, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b617-9\">In this last case, Mr. Justice Powell, writing for a unanimous Court, held as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"A3-b\">Not only are the interests underlying <em>Winship </em>implicated to a greater degree in this case, but in one respect the protection afforded those interests is less here. In <em>Winship </em>the ultimate burden of persuasion remained with the prosecution, although the standard had been reduced to proof by a fair preponderance of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>evidence. In this case, by contrast, the State has affirmatively shifted the burden of proof to the defendant. The result, in a case such as this one where the defendant is required to prove the critical fact in dispute, is to increase further the likelihood of an erroneous murder conviction.

The magnitude of the error in this trial would make it cognizable in a habeas proceeding as plain error even where no objection had been made before the trial court. <em>United States v. Buffa, </em>527 F.2d 1164 (6th Cir. 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-8\">We recognize that the test for habeas relief is even more difficult for a petitioner to overcome. Thus, the Supreme court has said:</p>\n<p id=\"b618-9\">The burden of demonstrating that an erroneous instruction was so prejudicial that it will support a collateral attack on the constitutional validity of a state court\u2019s judgment is even greater than the showing required to establish plain error on direct appeal. The question in such a collateral proceeding is \u201cwhether the ailing instruction by itself so infected the entire trial that the resulting conviction violates due process,\u201d <em>Cupp v. Naughten, </em>414 U.S., at 147 [94 S.Ct. 396, 400, 38 L.Ed.2d 368], not merely whether \u201cthe instruction is undesirable, erroneous, or even \u2018universally condemned,\u2019 \u201d <em>id., </em>at 146, 94 S.Ct.

Were this matter before us on direct review from a trial court within our own system, there is little doubt in my mind that the exercise of the court\u2019s supervisory powers to reverse would be justified. We act here, however, within the narrower confines of federal ha-beas corpus law.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">Like federal law,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Michigan law requires that, when self-defense is injected into a trial by the introduction or existence of some evidence supporting the claim, the burden is upon the state to prove beyond a reasonable doubt not only each element of the crime charged but also that the defendant did not act in self-defense.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Unlike the majority, I do not conceive that this rule, under Michigan law, makes the absence of self-defense an element of proof of the crime itself, which the state must invariably prove beyond a reasonable doubt, <em>Mullaney v. Wilbur, </em>421 U.S. 684, 95 S.Ct. 1881, 44 L.Ed.2d 508 (1975), rather than an affirmative defense, which is not subject to such a constitutional imperative. <em>Patterson v. New York, </em>432 U.S. 197, 205-11, 97 S.Ct. 2319, 53 L.Ed.2d 281 (1977).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See Leland v.

Townes, </em>391 Mich. 578, 218 N.W.2d 136, 141 (1974); <em>People v. Dickerson, </em>30 Mich.App. 447, 186 N.W.2d 850, 852 (1971); <em>People v.

Even though the state, as a matter of its own law, has elected to negate self-defense beyond a reasonable doubt, the defendant must first introduce or at least point to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>evidence from which its existence may be inferred.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">Where the state has permissibly cast upon the defendant the burden of producing evidence to support the existence of a fact, negation of that fact is not in common understanding an element of the crime. Absence of self-defense is simply not a fact which must be proved for every charge of murder in Michigan, and it is anomalous to label it an element for some murder prosecutions and not for others. The foregoing reasons convince me that the absence of self-defense is not an element of the crime for which Berrier stands convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\"><em>Patterson </em>indicates, without elaboration, that there are substantive constitutional restraints on a state\u2019s power to define the elements of crime. 432 U.S. at 210, 97 S.Ct. 2319. I am not convinced, however, that due process requires Michigan to make the absence of self-defense an element of homicide, rather than an affirmative defense, and I do not understand the majority to so hold. That being the case, Michigan may elect to allocate the burden to prove the mitigating fact of self-defense however it chooses, just as in <em>Patterson </em>the state permissibly burdened the defendant with the obligation to prove the mitigating fact of extreme emotional disturbance. <em>See </em>Allen, <em>The Restoration of </em>In re Winship: <em>A Comment on Burdens of Persuasion in Criminal Cases After </em>Patterson v. New York, 76 Mich.L.Rev. 30, 42-46 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">While it is unnecessary to suggest, as Professor Allen convincingly does,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> that <em>Patterson v. New York </em>overruled <em>Muiianey v. Wilbur, </em>it seems reasonably clear that <em>Patterson </em>would permit a state to treat self-defense as an outright affirmative defense and to allocate the burden of persuasion to the defendant as the instructions, according to the majority, did at Berrier\u2019s trial. If the foregoing view is correct, then the state trial judge\u2019s instructions, though perhaps erroneous under state law,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> do not violate constitutional rights under <em>Muiianey v. Wilbur, </em>as later refined in <em>Patterson, </em>where the ordinary and traditional elements of second-degree murder were proved beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-11\">Even if the instructions were found viola-tive of <em>Muiianey v. Wilbur, </em>I am of the opinion that the failure of counsel to object at trial to the instructions as given precludes our reaching the issue here by application of the more narrow review of state error propounded in <em>Francis v. Henderson, </em>425 U.S. 536, 96 S.Ct. 1708, 48 L.Ed.2d 149 (1976), and <em>Wainwright v. Sykes, </em>433 U.S. 72, 97 S.Ct. 2497, 53 L.Ed.2d 594 (1977). <em>See also Henderson v. Kibbe, </em>431 U.S. 145, 157, 97 S.Ct. 1730, 52 L.Ed.2d 203 (1977) (Burger, C. J., concurring). Those decisions rejected the \u201cdeliberate bypass\u201d language of <em>Fay v. Noia, </em>372 U.S. 391, 83 S.Ct. 822, 9 L.Ed.2d 837 (1963), in favor of a rule precluding federal habeas review in states having a contemporaneous objection rule where it is shown that defense counsel failed to object timely to the error.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> A federal court may overlook the state procedural waiver only if the habeas petitioner bears his burden of showing both \u201ccause\u201d justifying his failure to object and \u201cprejudice\u201d actually resulting to the petitioner from the constitutional error. Michigan had and has a contemporaneous objection rule.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>While <em>Wainwright, </em>on its facts, was concerned with the failure of counsel in the state trial to object to the admission of a confession later claimed to violate the defendant\u2019s rights under <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966), <em>Hankerson v. North Carolina, supra, </em>decided contemporaneously with <em>Wainwright </em>and involving the retroactive application of <em>Mullaney </em>furnishes considerable authority that <em>Wainwright </em>was intended to be fully applicable to waivers resulting from the failure to object to jury instructions. In <em>Hankerson, </em>as here, it was claimed that the state trial judge\u2019s instructions to the jury in the petitioner\u2019s state murder trial impermissibly shifted to the defendant the burden of proving the defense of self-defense, contrary to the holding of <em>Mullaney </em>v. <em>Wilbur, supra. </em>While holding that <em>Mullaney </em>was to be retroactively applied, Justice White in <em>Hankerson </em>expressly met the state\u2019s argument that retroactive application would be \u201cdevastating\u201d by observing that the states could \u201cinsulate past convictions by enforcing the normal and valid rule that failure to object to a jury instruction is a waiver of any claim of error.\u201d <em>Hankerson, supra, </em>432 U.S. at 244 n. 8, 97 S.Ct. at 2346.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">Petitioner has not met his burden under <em>Wainwright </em>of showing any cause justifying the failure of counsel to object at trial and, indeed, none can be gleaned from the record.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This should end the matter in my opinion, for the test in <em>Wainwright </em>is two-pronged and in the conjunctive.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b621-10\"><em>Wainwright </em>necessarily assumes not only error but constitutional error of sufficient proportions to be cognizable in habeas proceedings; were it otherwise the Supreme Court would not have needed to determine the effect of procedural waivers occurring in the course of trial. <em>Wainwright </em>indicates that, notwithstanding substantial constitutional error, the writ may only issue upon the further showing of cause and prejudice. Assuming, however, that the language of Justice Rehnquist in <em>Wainwright </em>alluded to in the majority opinion, <em>ante </em>at 522, permits an examination into the question of prejudice, even where no cause is shown, I am convinced that the error here does not rise to that degree of substantiality which <em>Wainwright, </em>according to the majority, arguably suggests. My reasons are six-fold:</p>\n<p id=\"b621-11\">First, the instructions are actually contradictory as to which party bore the burden of persuasion on self-defense. In two portions of the charge, including one immediately following the lengthy quotation from the instructions in the majority opinion, <em>ante </em>at 519-520, the trial court squarely placed the burden of persuasion as to self-defense on the state.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> It is well estab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>lished that \u201ca single instruction to a jury may not be judged in artificial isolation, but must be viewed in the context of the overall charge.\u201d <em>Cupp v. Naughten, </em>414 U.S. 141, 146-47, 94 S.Ct. 396, 400, 38 L.Ed.2d 368 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">Second, the instructions themselves, though poor, did at least include the traditional charges on the presumption of innocence and reasonable doubt. In addition, the charge placed a particularly heavy burden of proof on the government in at least one respect.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">Third, the defendant\u2019s attorney was present and heard the entire instructions as actually delivered by the trial judge to the jury. That he thereafter expressed his satisfaction with them is affirmative evidence that the instructions were not considered prejudicial under Michigan law by a Michigan attorney, whose primary function was to protect his client from such prejudice.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">Fourth, the issue was essentially which of two irreconcilable versions of the incident the 'jury would believe. The government claimed that Berrier was angry with the decedent, his brother-in-law, for having testified against _him in an earlier criminal trial and introduced evidence that Berrier had earlier expressed the intention to kill him. It was the government\u2019s contention that Berrier shot his brother-in-law seven times as the latter was leaving the Berrier home on the night in question. On the other hand, the defendant\u2019s theory and testimony was that he heard a commotion at the door, heard his wife scream, feared for his own life and that of his family, and that he thereupon seized his gun and fired at the man in self-defense, not knowing who it was. In such circumstances subtle differences in the application of the law of self-defense, and even in the burden of proving it, are unlikely to have played an important role in the jury\u2019s deliberations.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Put simply, the critical issue was whether Berrier did or did not recognize his brother-in-law.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-13\">Fifth, the alleged constitutional error here pales in comparison with the potential prejudice to a defendant from the improper admission of his confession to the crime, an error which, in <em>Wainwright, </em>did not override the petitioner\u2019s duty to show cause and prejudice to avoid a procedural waiver of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-14\">Finally, Justice White in <em>Hankerson </em>persuasively indicates that a state like Michigan, whose rules provide a waiver of error for the failure to object to jury instructions, may effectively insulate past convictions from the retroactive application of <em>Mulla-ney.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b622-15\">Accordingly, I would reverse and remand with instructions to dismiss the petition unless further proceedings in the district court should reveal merit in the other issues raised therein but not resolved in the district court or here.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b619-7\">. <em>E. g., United States v.

To the extent that the attorney\u2019s conduct may have failed to protect the petitioner, the issue of his competence under the Sixth Amendment is not before our court in this appeal. <em>See generally The Supreme Court, 1976 Term, </em>91 Harv.L.Rev. 70, 217-18 (1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b622-19\">. <em>See United States v. Jackson, </em>569 F.2d 1003, 1010 (7th Cir. 1978). In a similar setting, the district court\u2019s failure to instruct that the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant did not act in self-defense was held not to be plain error, cognizable without an objection at trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
