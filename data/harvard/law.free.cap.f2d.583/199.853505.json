BROWN, Chief Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b296-14\">Plaintiffs, white male over-the-road drivers for Transcon Lines and members of Teamsters Local 745, appeal from the judgment of the District Court entered against them in this suit for damages and injunc-tive relief under \u00a7 301 of the National' Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 185 (1970). Plaintiffs claim that defendant Transcon Lines breached its collective bargaining contracts with Local 745 by measuring their seniority for purposes of bid, layoff, and recall from the effective date of their transfer to the over-the-road unit, instead of from their initial date of hire. They also claim that defendant Local 745 violated its duty of fair representation by acquiescing in Transcon\u2019s violation of the contract and by failing to accord them fair representation in grievance proceedings in which they sought to obtain full seniority. We affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment in favor of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-18\">Each of the plaintiffs was initially employed with Transcon as a city driver. Under the collective bargaining agreements, over-the-road and city drivers compose separate bargaining units, though they are represented by the same union. Each plaintiff had requested transfer to a position as an over-the-road driver prior to August of 1971, but Transcon had no procedure for allowing an individual to transfer at the time of their initial applications. In August of 1971, however, Transcon announced a procedure whereby a transfer could be made upon the execution of a \u201cRequest for Transfer Form.\u201d Paragraph 4 of that form provided:</p>\n<p id=\"b296-19\">Qualified employees determined eligible for transfer will retain full company seniority for all purposes except bid, layoff, and recall. Seniority for bid or layoff purposes will be calculated from the first trip pulled as a line driver. The Company will waive the probationary period and transfer to the road will be considered permanent and final on the effective date of transfer with all seniority rights and obligations in the former bargaining unit terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-20\">Each of the plaintiffs subsequently requested transfer and signed the \u201cRequest for Transfer Form.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b297-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>Between October 1971 and October 1973, each of the plaintiffs filed either individual or joint grievances requesting a change in seniority dates. These grievances asserted that under the 1970-73 collective bargaining agreement between Transcon and the Union, seniority for all purposes should be measured from the date of hire as city drivers, or, alternatively, from the date of the initial request for a transfer to the over-the-road unit. The grievances were denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">In 1973, Transcon and the Southern Conference of Teamsters entered into a new over-the-road collective bargaining contract for 1973-76. In November 1973, pursuant to provisions of that contract, the over-the-road drivers of Teamster Locals 523, 745, and 886 who were Transcon employees voted on whether to retain \u201cterminal seniority\u201d or to implement a \u201cModified Systems Seniority Plan.\u201d The difference between the two systems is that under the modified plan, an employee\u2019s seniority is not confined strictly to his home terminal \u2014 if he is laid off at his home terminal, he can move to another terminal covered by the agreement and retain his seniority. The modified plan passed, and a new seniority list was posted that set forth the seniority dates of all affected Transcon employees, including the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">Following the posting of the new seniority roster, several of the present plaintiffs filed new grievances in which they again sought full seniority. The grievances were denied. A charge was then filed with the National Labor Relations Board. On April 30, 1974, the Regional Director refused to issue a complaint, on the ground that the evidence was insufficient to establish a violation of the National Labor Relations Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-9\">In January of 1975, each of the plaintiffs filed identical grievances requesting full company seniority for all purposes, including bid, layoff, and recall. These grievances were consolidated, and, in February, the Multi-State Grievance Committee of the Southern Conference referred them to the next-scheduled Area Committee meeting. That committee referred the grievances back to the Multi-State Committee. In June, the Multi-State Committee denied the grievances after hearings in which the plaintiffs, Local 745, and Transcon participated.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-10\">Shortly thereafter, the plaintiffs instituted this suit in the Northern District of Texas. After the District Judge had heard part of the plaintiffs\u2019 evidence and had reviewed the extensive pre-trial order, he suggested that a more expeditious disposition could be reached by the closing of testimony and submission of the case on the stipulations of fact, the limited trial testimony, and written briefs. The parties agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-11\">The District Court gave judgment for the defendants. On this appeal, the plaintiffs contend that the 1970-73 collective bargaining contracts and the Modified Seniority Systems Plan entitled them to full seniority for all purposes.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The claim on the contracts is grounded on Article 5, \u00a7 1 and Article 42, \u00a7 1 of both the over-the-road and city driver agreements. These provisions are substantially the same in both agreements and state that seniority \u201cshall only be broken by discharge, voluntary quit, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>more than a three (3) year layoff.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The claim based on the passage of the Modified Systems Seniority Plan relies on language in the plan which states that \u201cdrivers will use company seniority for all purposes at home terminal.\u201d However, we need not reach the merits of the plaintiff\u2019s contractual claims, for these claims have been presented and rejected in some eighteen separate grievance proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">Article 5, \u00a7 6 of the 1970-73 collective bargaining agreements for both the over-the-road and city driver units requires that-employee seniority disputes be submitted to a grievance committee,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and \u00a7 7 provides that \u201cthe seniority decisions of [grievance] committees . . . shall be final and binding.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Later agreements contain the same provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">Under these provisions and relevant case law, the decisions of the various grievance committees on the plaintiff\u2019s breach of contract claims are final and binding on them absent a breach by the Union of its duty of fair representation. <em>See Hines v. Anchor Motor Freight, </em>1976, 424 U.S. 554, 567-72, 96 S.Ct. 1048, 47 L.Ed.2d 231; <em>Humphrey v. Moore, </em>1964, 375 U.S. 335, 84 S.Ct. 363, 11 L.Ed.2d 370; <em>Lomax v. Armstrong Cork Company, </em>5 Cir., 1970, 433 F.2d 1277. <em>Haynes v. United States Pipe &amp; Foundry, </em>5 Cir., 1966, 362 F.2d 414. As was stated in <em>Hines, supra, </em>424 U.S. at 570-71, 96 S.Ct. at 1059:</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">To prevail against either the company or the Union, petitioners must not only show that their discharge was contrary to the contract but must also carry the burden of demonstrating breach of duty by the Union.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-12\">The District Court held that the plaintiffs failed to show a breach of the duty of fair representation by the Union, finding that \u201cwhile ... at times the Union\u2019s attitude toward its representative duties was less than enthusiastic,\u201d plaintiffs\u2019 proof did not establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the Union\u2019s conduct toward them was arbitrary, discriminatory, or in bad faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-13\">The District Court applied the proper legal standard to the facts of the case. <em>See Vaca v. Sipes, </em>386 U.S. 171, 87 S.Ct. 903, 17 L.Ed.2d 842 (1967). Although the question of whether the Union\u2019s conduct toward the plaintiffs was arbitrary, discriminatory, or in bad faith presents a mixed question of fact and law, the predominance of factual issues leads us to conclude that the District Court\u2019s findings on this score \u201ccome here well-armed with the buckler and shield\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> of F.R.Civ.P. 52(a). <em>See Backar v. Western States Producing Co., </em>5 Cir., 1977, 547 F.2d 876, 884. The \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d standard of that rule, of course, is somewhat modified where there is little or no \u201clive\u201d testimony in the trial court. <em>See Caradelis v. Refineria Panama, S.A., </em>5 Cir., 1967, 384 F.2d 589, 593 \u2014 94. In such cases, however, if the conclusions of the trial judge may reasonably be inferred from the record, such conclusions will not be disturbed on appeal. This is true even if conflicting inferences of equal reasonableness may be drawn from review of the same body of evidence. <em>See Skidmore v. Grueninger, </em>5 Cir., 1975, 506 F.2d 716, 723-24.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-14\">Applying this standard of review to the facts of this case, we believe that the District Court\u2019s findings are adequately sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>ported by the record. Like the District Court, we recognize that at times the Union\u2019s representation of these plaintiffs was not perfect. The plaintiffs point to several specific instances of Union misconduct, most of which concern the Union\u2019s role in the 1975 grievance proceedings, which they contend clearly demonstrate the Union\u2019s bad faith. For example, the Multi-State Committee\u2019s refusal to receive briefs prepared by the plaintiffs\u2019 attorney, the plaintiffs claim, was due to the Union\u2019s failure to apprise them of the procedural rules governing grievance proceedings. But these allegations of Union conduct that the plaintiffs find less than acceptable, when considered in light of the entire record, are insufficient in both substance and effect to show a breach of the duty of fair representation. At most, they prove that the Union may have been somewhat negligent in its handling of the grievances. Even if negligent conduct may under some circumstances breach the duty of fair representation,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the Union\u2019s presentation here was not so poor as to deprive the plaintiffs of a fair hearing. <em>See Hensley v. United Transports, Inc., </em>N.D.Tex., 1972, 346 F.Supp. 1108,1115:</p>\n<p id=\"A6k\">The Union saw to it that the facts (which were relatively simple in nature) were presented on plaintiff\u2019s behalf before each and every one of the hearing panels and committees . . . . [The Union\u2019s] repeated efforts on plaintiff\u2019s behalf constitute compelling evidence of good faith and lack of perfunctory treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\"><em>See also </em>Clark, The Duty of Fair Representation, 51 Tex.L.Rev. 1119, 1170-73 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">The District Court\u2019s finding that the Union did not act arbitrarily, discriminatorily, or in bad faith may reasonably be inferred from the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b296-15\">. In <em>International Brotherhood of Teamsters v. United States, </em>431 U.S. 324, 97 S.Ct. 1843, 52 L.Ed.2d 396, the Supreme Court held that a seniority system similar to the one involved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>here \u2014 one which requires city drivers to forfeit competitive seniority when transferring to over-the-road jobs \u2014 was a \u201cbona fide\u201d seniority system under \u00a7 703(h) of Title VII, 42 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 2000e-2(h) (1970). The plaintiffs in this case do not raise any Title VII issues.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b297-7\">. The plaintiffs hint an alternative argument that if the contract and Modified Systems Plan, properly construed, deny them full seniority, then the Union breached its duty of fair representation in negotiating the contracts. This claim, however, is foreclosed by such cases as <em>Ford Motor Company v. Huffman, </em>1953, 345 U.S. 330, 73 S.Ct. 681, 97 L.Ed. 1048; and <em>Humphrey v. Moore, </em>1964, 375 U.S. 335, 84 S.Ct. 363, 11 L.Ed.2d 370, which recognize the power of a union to exercise its discretion in contract negotiations to draw reasonable distinctions among groups of employees. The Supreme Court in <em>Teamsters, supra, </em>431 U.S. at 356, 97 S.Ct. at 1865, stated: \u201cThe placing of line drivers in a separate bargaining unit from other employees is rational, in accord with industry practice, and consistent with National Labor Relations Board precedents.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b298-8\">. They also claim that the Request for Transfer Form violates Article 6, \u00a7 2 of the bargaining agreements. That section provides that an employer shall not enter into any agreement or contract with his employees that in any way conflicts with the terms and conditions of the collective bargaining agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b298-9\">. See <em>also </em>Art. 42, \u00a7 1:</p>\n<p id=\"b298-10\">Controversies regarding seniority rights shall be settled by the Employer and the Union. Failing a settlement agreement by these parties, the controversy shall be processed under the Grievance Procedure set out in Articles 43 and 44 of this Agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b298-16\">. <em>See also </em>Art. 44, \u00a7 1:</p>\n<p id=\"b298-17\">Where a state or multiple state [grievance] committee, by a majority vote, settles a dispute, no appeal may be taken to the Southern-Conference Area Grievance Committee.
