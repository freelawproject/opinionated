Ohler by the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare (HEW).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-12\">The issue before this Court is whether the HEW findings are supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-13\">Ohler\u2019s claim for black lung benefits was filed in October 1972. The administrative judge found that Ohler was born January 6, 1908, he completed only a fifth grade education, he \u201cmay have worked for approximately 30 years in the coal mining industry .\u201d and his last substantial gainful employment was in 1971.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-14\">Thus, Ohler filed his claim prior to December 31, 1973, and had more than 15 years in coal mining, to qualify him for the most favorable presumptions as to disability under the law and regulations governing black lung benefit claims. 30 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 921 (c), 923. On July 1,1973, he was 65 years of age and had not worked since 1971. Ohler was drawing veteran\u2019s administration and social security disability benefits on that date. If he has pneumoconiosis, the evidence in the record does not establish any cause other than his employment in a coal mine.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-15\">The law provides, <em>inter alia, </em>that to carry out the intent of the black lung legislation,</p>\n<p id=\"Aai\">no claim for benefits under this part shall be denied solely on the basis of the results of a chest roentgenogram. In determining the validity of claims under this part, all relevant evidence shall be considered, including, where relevant, medical tests such as blood gas studies, X-ray examination, electrocardiogram, pulmonary function studies, or physical performance tests, and any medical history, evidence submitted by the claimant\u2019s physician, . . . and other supportive materials.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-17\">30 U.S.C. \u00a7 923 (b). It also contains a presumption for miners suffering pneumo-coniosis who were employed for 10 years or more that the disease arose of the mining employment. 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 921 (c)(1). If a miner was employed for 15 years or more, and there is a chest roentgenogram which is interpreted as negative,</p>\n<p id=\"b599-18\">and if other evidence demonstrates the existence of a totally disabling respiratory or pulmonary impairment, then there shall be a rebuttable presumption that such miner is totally disabled due to pneumoconiosis, . . . The Secretary may rebut such presumption only by establishing that (A) such miner does not, or did not, have pneumoconiosis, or that (B) his respiratory or pulmonary impairment did not arise out of, or in connection with, employment in a coal mine. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>30 U.S.C. \u00a7 921 (c)(4). Total disability under this act means when pneumoconiosis prevents the claimant from engaging in gainful employment requiring the skills and abilities of his previous mining employment. 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 902 (f).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">Regulations were adopted containing certain liberal standards to be applied to those persons such as Ohler who filed their claims by June 30,1973. Total disability is presumed, as applicable to Ohler, if a chest X-ray establishes the existence of pneumoconiosis <em>or </em>ventilatory studies establish a chronic respiratory disease as demonstrated by values equal to or less than the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">Height of Claimant FEVt MW</p>\n<p id=\"AKE\">67\" or less 2.3 92</p>\n<p id=\"AvI\">68\" 2.4 96</p>\n<p id=\"ATQg\">69\" 2.4 96</p>\n<p id=\"A9e\">70\" 2.5 100</p>\n<p id=\"b600-17\">20 C.F.R. \u00a7 410.490 (b)(1) (1977). If a claimant cannot meet these standards he can still prevail by proving that he is unable to do the work equivalent to his previous employment, and that X-rays or a biopsy shows he had pneumoconiosis, or absent such proof, he demonstrates the existence of a disabling chronic respiratory or pulmonary impairment by other evidence. The other evidence includes medical tests and all the items listed in 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 923 (b) quoted above. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 410.490 (e), 410.-412, 410.414 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-19\">The medical evidence before HEW, as relevant to the tests enumerated above, was:</p>\n<p id=\"b600-20\">1. A medical report dated December 18, 1973, by John S. Highland, M. D., showing Ohler had morning coughing and phlegm problems, shortness of breath and pulmonary emphysema. It recorded Ohler\u2019s height as 67 inches.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-21\">2. A medical report of H. Wendelkin, M. D., dated February 2, 1973, indicating morning phlegm, all day coughing, shortness of breath and very mild emphysema. Lungs were said to be clear with normal excursion and heart normal (apparently from listening, not based upon X-ray). Ohler\u2019s height was recorded as 67 inches.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-22\">3. An X-ray report dated February 2, 1973, interpreted by Meyer W. Jacobson, M. D., as normal with no active disease and negative for pneumoconiosis. Pulmonary function studies of the same date, apparently interpreted by Dr. Jacobson showed <em>FEV1 </em>was 2.5 liters and MW was 55.8 liters.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-23\">4. Pulmonary function studies dated October 29, 1974, taken at the Oklahoma State Sanatorium by Glen P. Dewberry, M. D., showing FEVi was 2.0 liters, without listing any MW. The report stated a diagnosis of \u201cpulmonary insufficiency due to chronic restrictive and obstructive pulmonary disease.\u201d There was reference to an X-ray of the same date, but no interpretation is shown. Ohler\u2019s height was listed in this report as 69 inches (5'9\").</p>\n<p id=\"b600-24\">There were no personal appearances, and the administrative law judge and the appeal panel made the determination from the written record of the examinations summarized above. The relevant findings by the administrative law judge were:</p>\n<p id=\"b600-25\">4. There is no medical evidence in the record establishing that the claimant has pneumoconiosis or any significant or severe respiratory impairment of any kind.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-26\">5. Pulmonary function studies given the claimant do not show that the claimant\u2019s respiratory impairments are so severe as to be considered of a disabling nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-27\">The administrative law judge also found, and stressed somewhat in his report, that Ohler\u2019s last work in the mining industry was around 1948 and he had engaged in substantial gainful activity since leaving the mines.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-28\">When Ohler filed his petition for review in the United States District Court he attached to it a medical report dated April 14, 1975, after the last action of HEW. He treated this as new and material evidence supporting his claim. The report, by Frank L. Bradley, M. D., diagnosed Ohler as suffering from pneumoconiosis and cor pulmo-nale. It referred to an X-ray report, to pulmonary function tests showing FEVi of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>2.39 liters and MW of 51 liters, and to other data. This report listed Ohler\u2019s height as 68 inches.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\">A motion for remand to HEW based upon this medical evidence was denied by the district judge, and we held an attempted appeal therefrom to be premature. <em>Ohler v. Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, </em>No. 76-1574 (10th Cir., filed Feb. 10, 1977, unpublished).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">The case was submitted to the district court on briefs and the written evidence, and that judge upheld the decision of the Secretary of HEW as supported by substantial evidence. The memorandum opinion recited the report of Dr. Bradley but did not comment thereon except to mention its earlier ruling that the evidence was \u201ccumulative.\u201d No finding was made as to whether such report could properly be considered in the review of the HEW decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">We hold that evidence outside the record which was presented to the administrative law judge may not be considered in judging whether the decision was based upon substantial evidence. There is no right to trial <em>de novo </em>in the district court or here. 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 923 (b); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405 (g). The district court may, \u201cat any time, on good cause shown, order additional evidence to be taken before the Secretary.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405 (g). Thus, the new medical report by Dr. Bradley may not be considered in the evaluation of whether the Secretary\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence, but may form the basis for remand if it is deemed to be of sufficient import. <em>See Keating v. Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, </em>468 F.2d 788 (10th Cir. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">In the instant case the evidence supporting the administrative judge\u2019s determination consists of the negative X-ray report, and the fact that one of the pulmonary function studies showed an FEVj reading above the levels set out in the applicable regulation. Perhaps certain aspects of the reports of Drs. Highland and Wendelken can also be considered supportive of the denial of benefits. Normally great deference is paid to the trier of the facts, and the recited evidence would be considered enough to uphold the agency decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-9\">There are several factors which lead us to a contrary conclusion here, however. First, the administrative judge\u2019s decision and apparently all appellate reviews were made without receiving any oral testimony and solely upon the briefs and the written medical and other reports in the record before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-10\">In a series of cases, this court has held that in the absence of oral testimony the appellate court is equally as capable as the trial court of examining the evidence and drawing conclusions therefrom, and that we are under a duty to do so . (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-11\"><em>Aetna Casualty and Surety Co. v. Hunt, </em>486 F.2d 81, 84 (10th Cir. 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-12\">Secondly, the findings of the administrative law judge state that \u201c[tjhere is no medical evidence in the record establishing . pneumoconiosis or any significant or severe respiratory impairment of any kind.\u201d The report of Dr. Dewberry, before the administrative judge, flatly contradicts that statement. It'makes a diagnosis of \u201c[pjulmonary insufficiency due to chronic restrictive and obstructive pulmonary disease.\u201d Its FEVj reading is significantly below the requirements of the regulations, although there is no MVV reading shown. The reported emphysema in the Highland and Wendelkin reports we consider as supportive of finding Ohler suffered from a significant respiratory disease. The unchallenged statements that Ohler was receiving veteran\u2019s administration and social security disability payments also would seem to contradict the administrative law judge\u2019s statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-13\">We are also disturbed by differences in the medical reports. Ohler\u2019s height is recorded as <em>5'7\" </em>in two, but 5'9\" in one; and we cannot help but notice the extra-record report of Dr. Bradley uses still another height, <em>5'8\". </em>The actual height is important because if Ohler were 5'10\" even the pulmonary study most unfavorable to his claim would show him as having a chronic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>respiratory disease, based upon FEVi and MW values alone. Considering the regulations make small variations significant in determining disability, the differences between FEVi reports of 2.0 in the Dewberry examination versus 2.5 in the Jacobson analysis seem quite far apart for a supposedly measurable function of the human body.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">The law states expressly that no claim for benefits shall be denied solely on the basis of chest X-rays which are read as negative for pneumoconiosis. 30 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 921 (c)(4), 923 (b). The law and regulations establish strong presumptions in favor of those who were in the mines for at least 15 years, to the effect that once the existence of a disabling respiratory impairment is established the burden shifts to the Secretary to prove that it is not pneumoconiosis. And negative X-rays are not enough to sustain that burden. Id.; 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 410.-490 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">The judge found this claimant \u201cmay have worked for approximately 30 years\u201d in the mines; he had supporting affidavits for 19 years of such service. Since pneumoconiosis is a progressive disease, as is emphysema, we do not think it is indicative that Ohler did not have the disease that he quit the mines in 1948 and worked at other jobs until 1971. There is no evidence that his other work might have contributed to his respiratory problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">The regulations provide that age, education and ability to engage in other types of work are to be considered in the determination of total disability. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 410.426 (1977). The individual claimant here was 65 years of age as of July 1, 1973, had a fifth grade education, had not worked for approximately two years, and was receiving both veteran\u2019s administration and social security disability benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">One cannot read the Black Lung Act and its various amendments without realizing the extreme liberality with which this law was intended to operate, particularly with respect to long-term coal miners, whose benefits were to be paid by the government rather than the coal operators. We said in <em>Paluso v. Mathews, </em>573 F.2d 4,10 (10th Cir. 1978):</p>\n<p id=\"b602-9\">We believe that the matter of \u201cprobability\u201d should be further refined so as to encompass a presumption that a claimant who filed for benefits before the cut-off date is to be regarded as a \u201cgood faith\u201d claimant and that if medical evidence acquired after June 30, 1973, can be construed to lead to a diagnosis that a miner <em>probably </em>was suffering from the disease on or before June 30, all reasonable doubts that he was so disabled are to be resolved in favor of the claimant. We are of the view that all reasonable inferences and presumptions should be construed in favor of a miner who when he filed his claim believed that he was suffering from black lung, even though he had not mustered sufficient evidence of his disability prior to the cut-off date. We anchor this approach to a variety of factors, including a claimant\u2019s ignorance or misunderstanding of eligibility standards, lack of adequate medical evidence due to the progressive nature of black lung disease, a miner\u2019s financial inability to seek proper medical confirmation, and inexact methods of diagnosis. It is a matter of overriding importance that the Act is remedial in nature and is to be given liberal construction. [Emphasis in original.]</p>\n<p id=\"b602-10\">As evidence of the intentions of Congress the Black Lung Reform Act of 1977, 92 Stat. 95, 103-105, adds 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 945, which will permit this claimant, if he should lose the present appeal, the right to have his claim reconsidered again by HEW on the record, or, at claimant\u2019s option, to have it referred to the Secretary of Labor if he wishes to present additional medical or other evidence in support of his claim of disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-11\">We reverse the judgment below and remand the case with directions to send it back to the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare for further deliberation in view of the considerations discussed herein, and to take additional relevant evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>proffered either by the government or the claimant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
