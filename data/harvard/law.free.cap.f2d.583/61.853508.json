The petition for review is made pursuant to \u00a7 11(a) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 660(a). We grant the petition, vacate the Commission\u2019s order, and set aside the citation upon which it is based.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">General Electric is a New York corporation which employs more than 27,000 workers at its Schenectady plant. In October of 1974, an OSHA compliance officer inspected that portion of the Schenectady worksite known as the Small AC Motor Department. The next month, the Secretary of Labor issued eighteen citations for alleged violations of \u00a7 5(a)(2) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 654(a)(2). These citations were contested by General Electric, and the matter was heard by Administrative Law Judge James Cronin, Jr., during March and April of 1975. Eventually, all but four of the citations were settled by the parties, and ALJ Cronin approved the settlement. One of the four unsettled citations forms the basis for this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-11\">Nestled among the various machinery of Building 81, Bay C18, of the Small AC Motor Department sits a \u201cdip and bake\u201d oven. Its purpose is to bake insulation onto small motors at certain stages of the manufacturing process. Although the record does not include a photograph of the oven, it is described as being approximately 10'8\" tall with an L-shaped top; it is 20 feet long and 12 feet wide. On top of the oven are two circulation and exhaust motors which require occasional maintenance.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In order to reach the motors to perform this maintenance, a worker climbs a ladder permanently affixed to the side of the oven by its manufacturer. Once aloft, the worker walks along a six-foot section of non-skid grating, the length of which is guarded by a railing and toeboard.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> One of the motors is adjacent to this railing, and when maintenance is being performed on it the worker stands approximately one foot from the edge of the oven top. The other motor is ten to fourteen feet from the end of the railing, but when this motor is being worked on the employee is almost four feet from the edge of the oven top.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-12\">The issue on this appeal is whether the unguarded portion of the top of the oven is a \u201cplatform\u201d within the meaning of regulations promulgated by the Secretary of Labor. The OSHA inspection officer, the Administrative Law Judge, and the Commission each believed that it was and, accordingly, determined that General Electric had violated the Act by failing to guard the perimeter of the oven top with a \u201cstandard railing.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-13\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b158-14\">The purpose of the Occupational Safety and Health Act is \u201cto assure so far as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>possible every working man and woman in the Nation safe and healthful working conditions . . 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 651(b). Section 5(a)(2) of the Act, the so-called \u201cspecific duty\u201d clause, requires each employer to \u201ccomply with occupational safety and health standards promulgated under this chapter.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 654(a)(2).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The standard concerning \u201cProtection of open-sided floors, platforms, and runways\u201d provides as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">Every open-sided floor or platform 4 feet or more above adjacent floor or ground level shall be guarded by a standard railing (or the equivalent as specified in paragraph (e)(3) of this section) on all open sides except where there is entrance to a ramp, stairway, or fixed ladder. The railing shall be provided with a toeboard wherever, beneath the open sides,</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">(i) Persons can pass,</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">(ii) There is moving machinery, or</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">(iii) There is equipment with which falling materials could create a hazard.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-9\">29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1910.23(c)(1).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201cPlatform\u201d is defined as:</p>\n<p id=\"b159-10\">A working space for persons, elevated above the surrounding floor or ground; such as a balcony or platform for the operation of machinery and equipment. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1910.21(a)(4). Because the oven top was regarded by the Secretary as a \u201cplatform\u201d but was not guarded by a \u201cstandard railing\u201d or its equivalent,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> General Electric was cited for a violation of \u00a7 1910.-23(c)(1).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b159-16\">ALJ Cronin made the following observations regarding the question whether the unguarded portion of the oven top was a \u201cplatform\u201d under the standards:</p>\n<p id=\"b159-17\">It reasonably may be argued that \u00a7 1910.23(c)(1) should be interpreted to apply only to elevated working spaces, 4 feet or [more] above ground level, which are designed primarily for the operation of machinery and equipment and which require employee presence on a predictable and regular basis; and not to spaces where only occasional maintenance or repair work is performed.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-18\">He determined, however, that the Commission\u2019s majority opinion in the ease of <em>General Electric Co., </em>OSHRC Docket No. 2739 (1975), \u201cgave the broadest possible meaning to the term \u2018platform\u2019 \u201d by suggesting \u201cthat an elevated area on any structure constitutes a platform whenever work is required to be performed thereon and sufficient protection from an existing falling hazard is not provided.\u201d Accordingly, he felt \u201cconstrained\u201d to hold that the oven top was a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>\u201cplatform\u201d and that a railing was required. <em>General Electric Co., </em>OSHRC Docket No. 11344 (1975). In affirming this result, the three Commissioners made scant mention of this issue. Chairman Bamako\u2019s separate concurring opinion referred to the matter directly, but only to the extent of noting that the oven was used in General Electric\u2019s production operation and that the top of the oven was used for \u201cnormal maintenance work incident to [the production] operation.\u201d <em>General Electric Co., </em>OSHRC Docket No. 11344 (1977) (Bamako, <em>Chairman, </em>concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">Our first concern in a case such as this is, of course, the determination of the standard of review we are to employ. As explained in <em>Marshall v. Western Electric, Inc., and OSHRC, </em>565 F.2d 240, 244 (2d Cir. 1977), \u201cthis court has consistently held that its role \u2018is to decide whether the Commission\u2019s interpretation of the Regulation is unreasonable and inconsistent with its purpose, the normal standard for review of the interpretation of a regulation by the agency charged with its administration.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>See Brennan </em>v. <em>OSHRC and Gerosa, Inc., </em>491 F.2d 1340, 1344 (2d Cir. 1974); <em>Brennan v. OSHRC and Underhill Construction Corp., </em>513 F.2d 1032, 1038 (2d Cir. 1975). See <em>also Udall </em>v. <em>Tallman, </em>380 U.S. 1, 16-17, 85 S.Ct. 792, 13 L.Ed.2d 616 (1965); <em>Bowles v. Seminole Rock &amp; Sand Co., </em>325 U.S. 410, 413-14, 65 S.Ct. 1215, 89 L.Ed. 1700 (1945). \u201cThe corollary to this proposition is that a court need not defer to an interpretation it finds unreasonable.\u201d <em>Langer Roof &amp; Sheet Metal, Inc. v. Secretary of Labor and OSHRC, </em>524 F.2d 1337, 1339 (7th Cir. 1975); <em>see General Electric Co. v. Gilbert, </em>429 U.S. 125, 140-46, 97 S.Ct. 401, 50 L.Ed.2d 343 (1976). Moreover, it has also been made clear that, in considering the proper deference to be given to an administrative ruling, \u201c[t]he weight of such a judgment in a particular case will depend upon the thoroughness evident in its consideration, the validity of its reasoning, its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements, and all those factors which give it power to persuade, if lacking power to control.\u201d <em>Skidmore v. Swift &amp; Co., </em>323 U.S. 134, 140, 65 S.Ct. 161, 164, 89 L.Ed. 124 (1944). <em>See also Adamo Wrecking Co. v. United States, </em>434 U.S. 275, 287 n.5, 98 S.Ct. 566, 574 n.5, 54 L.Ed.2d 538 (1978); <em>Bethlehem Steel Corp. v. OSHRC and Marshall, </em>573 F.2d 157, 160 (3d Cir. 1978). Here, although the Commission\u2019s consideration of the meaning of the term \u201cplatform\u201d appears to have been relatively thorough, we find its reasoning in this case flawed and the result inconsistent with other pronouncements.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">The regulation defines \u201cplatform\u201d as \u201c[a] working space for persons, elevated above the surrounding floor or ground; such as a balcony or platform for the operation of machinery and equipment.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1910.21(a)(4). We do not read this definition to apply to every flat surface over four feet high upon which employees may some day stand while performing some task related to their employment and the operations of their employer. An elevated flat surface does not automatically become a \u201cworking space\u201d and a \u201cplatform\u201d merely because employees occasionally set foot on it while working. Had the authors of the regulation intended the term \u201cplatform\u201d to include every elevated flat surface upon which employees could alight, they no doubt would have forgone the opportunity to limit the definition by using the phrase \u201csuch as a balcony or platform for the operation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>machinery and equipment.\u201d The meaning of one term may be determined by reference to the terms it is associated with, and where specific words follow a general word, the specific words restrict application of the general term to things that are similar to those enumerated. <em>See </em>2A Sutherland, Statutory Construction \u00a7\u00a7 47.16 <em>(noscitur a sociis), </em>47.17 <em>(ejusdem generis) </em>(4th ed. 1973). We do not believe that infrequent, periodic maintenance of machinery is equivalent to the \u201coperation\u201d of that machinery, cf. <em>Bethlehem Steel Corp. </em>v. <em>OSHRC and Marshall, supra, </em>573 F.2d at 161 (phrase \u201cnormal operating conditions\u201d does not include maintenance operations), and so cannot agree with the Commission\u2019s conclusion that the oven top in this case is a \u201cplatform\u201d so as to require a standard railing. As suggested by ALJ Cronin, a reasonable interpretation of \u00a7 1910.23(c)(1) is that it applies \u201conly to elevated working spaces, 4 feet or [more] above ground level, which are designed primarily for the operation of machinery and equipment and which require employee presence on a predictable and regular basis; and not to spaces where only occasional maintenance or repair work is performed.\u201d As we believe is amply demonstrated by this case, to depart from this interpretation of the standard is to venture into unreasonableness.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">The Commission, the Commission\u2019s Administrative Law Judges, and OSHA\u2019s compliance officers have been surprisingly inconsistent and unpredictable with regard to the definition of the term \u201cplatform.\u201d It can in no way be said that the result urged here by the Commission and the Secretary is based upon \u201ca long-standing agency interpretation.\u201d <em>Brennan v. OSHRC and </em>Gerosa, <em>Inc., supra, </em>491 F.2d at 1344. To the extent that consistency is discernible in the administrative and interpretive development of the term, it appears to favor the result we reach here.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">The first important case to consider the definition of \u201cplatform\u201d was <em>Ventre Packing Co., Inc., </em>OSHRC Docket No. 396 (1973), the decision upon which Commissioner Bar-nako relied in the instant case. The Commission, per Commissioner Van Namee, determined that the roof of a walk-in cooler, which was being used as a storage space, would be a \u201cworking space\u201d and hence a \u201cplatform\u201d if it could be shown that workers had gone on to the surface to either store or retrieve materials. No such evidence had been presented, however, so no railing was required. Chairman Moran expressed his disagreement with what he regarded as dicta to the effect that mere employee presence on the roof would transform it into a \u201cworking space\u201d and a \u201cplatform\u201d so as to require a railing. Next came <em>California Rotogravure Co., </em>OSHRC Docket No. 668 (1975). There, the Commission, again per Commissioner Van Namee, determined that an open-sided flat roof of an inside office, which was also being used as a storage space, was a \u201cplatform\u201d that required a railing \u2014 work was performed on the roof, therefore it was a \u201cworking space,\u201d therefore it was a \u201cplatform.\u201d Commissioner Cleary joined in this result. Chairman Moran dissented. Using the same reasoning as he had in <em>Ventre Packing Co., </em>he argued that the conclusion that \u201cthe roof of the office becomes a platform because employees set foot on it\u201d was inconsistent with the purpose and the plain meaning of the standard and could serve only to draw within the ambit of the standard structures to which it was never intended to apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-10\">The decision which ALJ Cronin felt \u201cconstrained\u201d to follow in this case came next. <em>General Electric Co., </em>OSHRC Docket No. 2739, <em>rev\u2019d in part on other grounds, </em>540 F.2d 67 (2d Cir. 1976). There, the Commission, per Commissioner Cleary, determined that the broad provisions of 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1910.252(e)(1)(i)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> required an expansive reading of the term \u201cplatform\u201d and held that a railing was required around the tops of items being manufactured because welders were required to work there.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>[T]he purpose of the Act is to protect the health and safety of workers. This purpose is not well served by reading a standard in a manner that detracts therefrom. Here, this purpose is best served by a broad construction of the word \u201cplatform\u201d in the standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">The Commission also determined that a powered work platform that was used regularly by employees was a \u201cplatform.\u201d Commissioner Van Namee dissented because the sweeping use of the term \u201cplatform\u201d could lead to preposterous results:</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">If [General Electric] is required to provide standard railings on its product because it is of such size that employees must be on it to manufacture it, then any other employer similarly situated can also be required to erect guardrails on its product while it\u2019s being manufactured. For example, [this] rule will require the erection of guardrails on the wings, tail assemblies and fuselages of large aircraft being manufactured. Other equally monstrous modifications of product design can be easily imagined.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">That case was decided after the OSHA inspection that led to this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">In 1976 the Commission decided the case of <em>Allis-Chalmers Corp., </em>OSHRC Docket No. 5210 (1976). Commissioner Moran wrote as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">Although the evidence establishes that respondent\u2019s employees used the transformer tops as \u201cworking space[s],\u201d we conclude that the mere use of a structure as such does not establish that it is a platform. The definition also indicates that the words \u201cwork space\u201d refer to such things as a balcony or platform \u201cfor the operation of machinery or equipment.\u201d In my opinion, this specific language restricts the definition of \u201cplatform\u201d to a structure that is erected to accomplish work that is being performed.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-9\">Chairman Bamako agreed in the result, but declined to join Commissioner Moran\u2019s restrictive definition of the term \u201cplatform.\u201d Commissioner Cleary dissented, citing <em>General Electric Co., supra, </em>and describing as \u201ccrucial\u201d the fact that the open-sided surfaces in question were \u201cregular working surfaces\u201d for the employees. In Weyerhaeuser <em>Co., </em>OSHRC Docket Nos. 1231, 1758 (1977), the other case upon which Chairman Bamako relied in his concurring opinion in the instant dispute, Chairman Bamako and Commissioner Cleary determined that an elevated surface used regularly by workers as a place from which they could saw off protruding ends of lumber was a \u201cplatform\u201d that required a railing. They distinguished between \u201ca maintenance problem\u201d which required employee presence on the surface and the \u201cusual work practice\u201d of requiring employees to go onto the \u201cplatform\u201d as a normal part of the production process. The two Commissioners relied not on the occasional presence of workers for maintenance purposes but on the regular and required presence of workers for normal production purposes to reach the conclusion that a railing was required. Commissioner Moran dissented.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-12\">More recently, prior to the appointment of Commissioner Cottine and while there were only two members of the Commission, Chairman Cleary and Commissioner Bamako have acknowledged their disagreement on the breadth of the term \u201cplatform.\u201d <em>Simmons, Inc., </em>OSHRC Docket No. 12862 (1977); <em>Prowler Travel Trailers of New York, Inc., </em>OSHRC Docket No. 15636 (1977). In <em>Simmons, </em>Chairman Cleary expressed his belief that when a worker is required to do repair work on the top surface of a machine two or three times weekly, that surface is a \u201cplatform\u201d that requires a railing. Commissioner Bamako, on the other hand, argued that not every surface upon which an employee may stand while performing work is a \u201cplatform\u201d within the meaning of the standard, citing as an example <em>Whirlpool Corp., </em>OSHRC Docket No. 9224 (1977). <em>See also Union Carbide Grafito, Inc., </em>OSHRC Docket No. 7368 (1975). As defined by Commissioner Bamako, a \u201cplatform\u201d would include only those surfaces used for the operation of machinery and equipment.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>Thus, we are neither bound nor persuaded by the opinions of the Secretary and the Commission that the top of General Electric\u2019s dip and bake oven is a \u201cplatform\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 1910.23(c)(1). We acknowledge that \u201c[t]he keystone of the Act is preventability.\u201d <em>Brennan v. OSHRC and Underhill Construction Corp., supra, </em>513 F.2d at 1039. And, as recently noted by this Court, \u201c[w]e recognize that OSHA\u2019s efforts have contributed significantly to the health and welfare of our nation\u2019s work force.\u201d <em>American Air Lines, Inc. v. Secretary of Labor and OSHRC, </em>578 F.2d 38, 39 (2d Cir. 1978). But, apparently, the Secretary and the Commission need to be reminded on occasion of their responsibility to be \u201creasonable\u201d \u2014 this is such an occasion. Along these lines, the Third Circuit has recently made the following observation:</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">The purpose of OSHA standards is to improve safety conditions in the working place, by telling employers just what they are required to do in order to prevent or minimize danger to employees. In an adjudicatory proceeding, the Commission should not strain the plain and natural meaning of words in a standard to alleviate an unlikely and uncontemplated hazard. The responsibility to promulgate clear and unambiguous standards is upon the Secretary. The test is not what he might possibly have intended, but what he said. If the language is faulty, the Secretary has the means and the obligation to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\"><em>Bethlehem Steel Corp. v. OSHRC and Marshall, supra, </em>573 F.2d at 161. Similarly, the Fifth Circuit has offered the following comments:</p>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">If the regulation missed its mark, the fault lies in the wording of the regulation \u2014 a matter easily remedied under the flexible regulation promulgating structure . . . with no need to press limits by judicial construction in an industrial area presenting infinite operational situations.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-10\">To strain the plain and natural meaning of words for the purpose of alleviating a perceived safety hazard is to delay the day when the occupational safety and health regulations will be written in clear and concise language so that employers will be better able to understand and observe them.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-11\"><em>Diamond Roofing Co. v. OSHRC and Usery, </em>528 F.2d 645, 648-50 (5th Cir. 1976) (citations and footnote omitted). Finally, the Seventh Circuit has noted:</p>\n<p id=\"b163-12\">It may well be, as the Secretary urges, that employees working on a flat roof require perimeter protection. If this be so, the Secretary has the machinery available to amend the section in question or to promulgate an entirely new section that would lay the matter to rest. It appears to us that the time and effort\u2014 not to mention the expense \u2014 of the notice and hearing required for such regulation changes would be far less than the effort and expense of the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-13\"><em>Langer Roof &amp; Sheet Metal, Inc. v. Secretary of Labor and OSHRC, supra, </em>524 F.2d at 1339. We share these sentiments.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-14\">Simply put, to apply this standard to the surface here in question would go too far\u2014 it would be inconsistent with the wording of the standard and it would create considerable doubt that the standard provides <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>to employers fair warning of the conduct which it prohibits or requires. <em>See Connally v.

As a result of a July 21, 1974, safety inspection by the union representing the employees at the Small AC Motors Department, General Electric installed a guardrail around this portion of the top of the oven. The union had complained about an unguarded \u201ccatwalk\u201d on the top of the oven and the company, without agreeing that the surface was a catwalk or that a guardrail was required, installed a six-foot railing and toeboard. Upon reinspection, the union made no further complaints about the safety of the oven top. This railing was present on the day of the OSHA inspection.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b159-11\">. The Act is administered jointly by the Secretary of Labor and the Commission, each having separate and distinct responsibilities. The Secretary is responsible for the promulgation and enforcement of standards such as the one now under consideration, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 655, 657, 658, 659(a). The Commission, on the other hand, is assigned the relatively limited role of administrative adjudication. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 659(c), 661. Here, General Electric was cited for a \u201cserious violation\u201d of the Secretary\u2019s standards and assessed a penalty of $500.

ALJ Cronin determined that \u201c[i]f an employee were to fall off the oven, he could suffer serious physical injury.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b159-12\">. This Court has recently commented on \u201cthe Byzantine pattern of OSHA standards\u201d having to do with \u201cplatforms,\u201d noting that \u201cthere is room for increased clarity of definition.\u201d <em>General Electric Co. v. OSHRC, </em>540 F.2d 67, 70 n.2 (2d Cir. 1976). As evidenced by our decision today, the pattern of the mosaic remains blurred.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b159-20\">. A \u201cstandard railing\u201d is defined as \u201c[a] vertical barrier erected along exposed edges of a floor opening, wall opening, ramp, platform, or runway to prevent falls of persons.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1910.21(a)(6).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b159-21\">. No citation was made based upon the so-called \u201cgeneral duty\u201d clause of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 654(a)(1), which requires employers to \u201cfurnish to each of his employees employment and a place of employment which are free from recognized hazards that are causing or are likely to cause death or serious physical harm to his employees.\u201d On this appeal our review is limited to the validity of the ground upon which the agency rested its decision, and we express no opinion on the impact of the general duty clause on the facts presented by this case. <em>See General Electric Co. v. OSHRC, </em>540 F.2d 67, 69, 70 n.3 (2d Cir. 1976), <em>citing SEC v. Chenery Corp., </em>318 U.S. 80, 63 S.Ct. 454, 87 L.Ed. 626 (1943).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b160-5\">. Although it has been suggested that courts of appeals should give even greater deference to an interpretation of a regulation that the Secretary and Commission agree on, <em>see, e. g., Wisconsin Electric Power Co. v. OSHRC and Secretary of Labor, </em>567 F.2d 735, 738 (7th Cir. 1977); <em>International Union v. OSHRC, </em>557 F.2d 607, 611 n.9 (7th Cir. 1977); Irvington Moore, <em>Division of U. S. Natural </em>Resources, Inc. v. <em>OSHRC and Marshall, </em>556 F.2d 431, 434 (9th Cir. 1977) (Lumbard, J.); <em>Clarkson Construction Co. v. OSHRC and Secretary of Labor, </em>531 F.2d 451, 457 (10th Cir. 1976); <em>Budd Co. v. OSHRC, </em>513 F.2d 201, 205 (3d Cir. 1975), Chief Judge Kaufman has recently noted that \u201cwhere, as here, the Commission and the Secretary unite in an interpretation of a regulation within their joint sphere, the normal degree of judicial deference is appropriate.\u201d <em>American Airlines Inc. v. Secretary of Labor and OSHRC, </em>578 F.2d 38, 39 n.1 (2d Cir. 1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b161-7\">. The standard reads as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">A welder or helper working on platforms, scaffolds, or runways shall be protected against falling. This may be accomplished by the use of railings, safety belts, life lines, or some other equally effective safeguards.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b162-10\">. The cases discussed in the text are, in our opinion, only the more important cases on point; there are others, all of which demonstrate not only the confusion generated by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>term \u201cplatform\u201d but also the single thread of continuity that we have been able to discover\u2014 whenever a \u201cplatform\u201d has been found to exist, workers have been assigned to do work on that surface with some regularity and the nature of the work assigned has been central to the processes of the employer. We have found no case where a worker\u2019s presence on a flat surface merely for the performance of infrequent maintenance functions has been used as a basis for holding such a surface to be a \u201cplatform.\u201d See <em>generally Arizona Public Service Co., </em>OSHRC Docket No. 329 (1972) (Burchmore, ALJ); <em>U. S. Homes, Inc., Sandler-Bilt Division, </em>OSHRC Docket No. 367 (1972) (Harris, ALJ); <em>Kidets, Inc., </em>OSHRC Docket No. 2670 (1973) (Dern, ALJ); <em>George A.

Because of our disposition of this case, we need not and do not reach the question whether the Secretary failed to show a violation of the cited standard within the six-month limitation period. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 658(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
