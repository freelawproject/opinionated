KAUFMAN, Chief Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1285-15\">Aware of the limits of mortal knowledge, legislatures often enact statutes ordaining that proof of one fact shall imply existence of another. But the link between the proven fact and the presumed one must not be tenuous nor may it invade the fact-finding province of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1285-16\">In this case Carmen Garcia challenges a State conviction based upon N.Y.Penal Law \u00a7 220.25(1), which declares that presence of narcotics in an automobile \u201cis presumptive evidence of knowing possession thereof by each and every person in the automobile at the time such controlled substance was found.\u201d Judge Stewart found the statute unconstitutional on its face and as applied to Garcia, and granted her habeas corpus petition. Although we uphold the statute, as authoritatively construed by New York State\u2019s highest court, we find that the State trial judge\u2019s instructions encroached upon the jury\u2019s duty to find proof of possession beyond a reasonable doubt. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1285-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1285-18\">The facts necessary for an understanding of Garcia\u2019s contentions are clear from the state record, and they may be briefly limned. On September 22,1971, New York City police received a telephone tip<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that a gold-colored 1969 Chevrolet, bearing Florida license plates and carrying a kilogram of cocaine, would be on the Brooklyn side of the Williamsburgh Bridge that afternoon at 4:00 p. m. A flying squad of narcotics detectives intercepted such a car soon after it crossed the bridge from Manhattan to Brooklyn. At the wheel of the Chevrolet was Jose Low. Widelto Leyva occupied the seat closest to the passenger door. Between them sat Garcia.</p>\n<p id=\"b1285-19\">When Detectives Raymond Viera and John McClean reached the automobile, they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1190\">*1190</page-number>noticed a brown manila envelope protruding about three inches from under the right front seat, between Garcia and Leyva. Upon opening the envelope, which measured approximately 9\" X 12\" X <em>W, </em>Viera discovered two plastic packets containing a white powdery substance. As the informant had assured the authorities, the substance was almost precisely one kilogram of cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-4\">Low, Leyva, and Garcia were charged with knowing possession of a controlled substance and possession with intent to sell. They were tried together in Kings County Supreme Court before Justice Garbarino and a jury. Viera and McClean, corroborated by their partners in the arresting squad, testified to stopping the car and discovering the envelope. A chemist identified the substance in the plastic bags as cocaine, and the State rested. The only witness for the defense was Low, who testified that he had never met Garcia and Leyva before the day of the arrest and that he was driving them to Brooklyn as a favor to a friend.</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-5\">The proof clearly established that all three defendants were present in the Chevrolet when the cocaine was discovered. To make the critical leap from \u201cpresence\u201d to \u201cknowing possession,\u201d the State relied heavily upon \u00a7 220.25(1). In his summation, Prosecutor Barra told the jury, \u201cI merely have to prove automobile, presence, found contraband in that automobile. That is what I must prove beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1286-12\">Justice Garbarino\u2019s charge echoed the prosecutor\u2019s view of the statute:</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-13\">[U]pon proof of the presence of cocaine in the vehicle, and further upon proof that these three defendants were in the car with the cocaine at the time of the arrest, the Penal Law says in effect that from this evidence, each of the defendants in the automobile possessed the cocaine, knowingly possessed the cocaine.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ayb-dedup-0\">The trial judge did tell the jury that the State always bears the burden of proving the defendants guilty beyond a reasonable doubt and that the presumption did not affect this burden. In addition, he told the jury that the presumption could be overcome by defense evidence. But he charged that the State was entitled to its presumption unless the rebuttal evidence was \u201csubstantial\u201d and \u201ccreate[d] a reasonable doubt in your minds that the defendants knowingly possessed this cocaine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-14\">The jury convicted all three defendants of possession, and Garcia and Leyva\u2014 but not Low \u2014 of possession with intent to sell. The Appellate Division affirmed, as did the Court of Appeals, <em>People v. Leyva, </em>38 N.Y.2d 160, 379 N.Y.S.2d 30, 341 N.E.2d 546 (1975). Having exhausted her state remedies,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Garcia brought this petition for habeas corpus.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Judge Stewart granted the writ, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1287-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1191\">*1191</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1287-5\">Although the ultimate question of constitutionality in a habeas corpus case is determined by the federal courts, we must assess the statute as authoritatively construed in this case by the Court of Appeals in <em>People v. Leyva, supra. </em>As we understand Judge Fuchsberg\u2019s opinion, it construed the statute as creating only a permissive presumption \u2014 that is, one authorizing, but not commanding, the jury to reach a certain conclusion from the proof of specified underlying facts. Even in the absence of rebuttal evidence by the defendants, the court held, \u201cA jury is not to be told that it <em>must </em>find defendants guilty if the prosecution proves that they and drugs were present in a car together; it is only to be told that it <em>may </em>so find.\u201d 38 N.Y.2d at 167, 379 N.Y.S.2d at 36, 341 N.E.2d at 550. Thus, if properly applied, the presumption could not possibly operate as tantamount to a directed verdict against defendants. Id.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1287-6\">The effect of \u00a7 220.25(1) is therefore the same as the presumption approved in <em>United States v. Gainey, </em>380 U.S. 63, 70, 85 S.Ct. 754, 13 L.Ed.2d 658 (1965), for it \u201csimply means that a jury may, if it sees fit, convict upon such evidence, as it shall be deemed in law sufficient to authorize a conviction, but does not require such a result.\u201d (emphasis deleted) Since the decision whether to accept or reject the conclusions indicated by the presumption is thus entirely in the hands of the jury, the judge\u2019s only role is to make certain that the jury is not afforded an opportunity to reach a verdict of guilty on an irrational basis. <em>Tot v. United States, </em>319 U.S. 463, 467, 63 S.Ct. 1241, 87 L.Ed. 1519 (1943). For a presumption to meet this standard, it must \u201cat least be said with substantial assurance that the presumed fact is more likely than not to flow from the proved fact on which it is made to depend.\u201d <em>Leary v. United States, </em>395 U.S. 6, 36, 89 S.Ct. 1532, 23 L.Ed.2d 57 (1969).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In making this judicial assessment, we must \u201cweigh heavily\u201d the legislative determination favoring the particular presumption. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1287-11\">In enacting \u00a7 220.25(1), the New York Legislature had the benefit of a comprehensive report by the Temporary State Commission to Evaluate the Drug Laws. The Commission \u2014 four state senators, three assemblymen, a judge, and a medical doctor\u2014 conducted seven days of public hearings throughout the state. Its subcommittee on Narcotic Drugs held an additional six days of hearings. Based on this extensive record, the Commission rejected the possibility</p>\n<p id=\"azr-dedup-1\">that persons transporting dealership quantities of contraband are likely to go driving around with innocent friends or that they are likely to pick up strangers. We do not doubt that this can and does in fact occasionally happen, but because we find it more reasonable to believe that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1192\">*1192</page-number>the bare presence in the vehicle is culpable, we think it reasonable to presume culpability in the direction which the proven facts already point.</p>\n<p id=\"b1288-4\">The Legislature therefore had justification to find that those discovered in an automobile with dealership quantities of controlled substances are more likely than not to have knowing possession of the drugs.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Accordingly, we hold \u00a7 220.25(1) to be constitutional as applied to such large quantities of narcotics. <em>Compare Gonzalez, supra, </em>442 F.2d at 710.</p>\n<p id=\"b1288-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1288-6\">That \u00a7 220.25(1) is constitutional as applied to this case does not end our inquiry, however, for the jury was guided by the construction of the statute made in Justice Garbarino\u2019s courtroom. Although the Court of Appeals concluded that the jury charge \u201cconveyed the requisite permissiveness with respect to use of a presumption and, therefore, was acceptable,\u201d 38 N.Y.2d at 171, 397 N.Y.S.2d at 39, 341 N.E.2d at 553, a careful reading of the trial judge\u2019s charge leads us to conclude otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b1288-7\">Justice Garbarino charged that \u201cthe Penal Law says in effect that from this evidence [that both the cocaine and the defendants were present in the automobile] each of the defendants possessed the cocaine, knowingly possessed the cocaine.\u201d If the foundation was laid, he added, the state was \u201centitled to the presumption . charging them with possession.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1288-8\">These instructions ran afoul of the guarantee of <em>In re Winship, </em>397 U.S. 358, 364, 90 S.Ct. 1068, 1073, 25 L.Ed.2d 368 (1970), that \u201cthe Due Process Clause protects the accused against conviction except upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime with which he is charged.\u201d Since possession \u201cis an ingredient of the crime, charged, its existence is a question of fact which must be submitted to the jury.\u201d <em>Morisette v. United States, </em>342 U.S. 246, 274, 72 S.Ct. 240, 255, 96 L.Ed. 288 (1952). It was, accordingly, for the jury in this case to decide not only whether the foundation of presence was properly laid, but also whether the critical leap to a conclusion of possession beyond a reasonable doubt was appropriate. Given the inviolable function of the jury as a trier of fact, <em>Morisette </em>instructed, \u201c[i]t follows that the trial court may not withdraw or prejudge the issue by instruction that the law raises a presumption\u201d of an element of the crime from proof of an underlying fact. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1288-11\">Justice Garbarino did precisely that by explaining that upon proof of the defendants\u2019 presence in a car with cocaine \u00a7 220.-25(1) \u201csays in effect\u201d that each of the defendants knowingly possessed the narcotics. The prosecution, he said, was then \u201centitled to the presumption . . . charging them with possession.\u201d And this error was not cured but rather compounded by his additional instruction that the defendants could rebut the presumption. In charging that defendants were required to come forward with evidence that would \u201craise a reasonable doubt in your minds that the defendants possessed this cocaine,\u201d the trial judge clearly shifted the burden of proof on the element of knowing possession. This was error \u2014 and of manifest constitutional dimension. <em>Winship, supra. </em>No matter how persuasive the evidence of guilt may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1193\">*1193</page-number>seem to the court, a defendant does not carry the burden of disputing it, nor does his failure to offer evidence on an element of the crime change or satisfy the prosecutor\u2019s burden. <em>United States v. Hall, </em>525 F.2d 1254, 1256 (5th Cir. 1976); <em>DeCecco v. United States, </em>338 F.2d 797, 798 (1st Cir. 1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-5\">The remainder of the charge did not ameliorate the fatal flaws in Justice Gar-barino\u2019s instructions on the presumption.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> As in <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>545 F.2d 301, 306 (2d Cir. 1976), \u201c[T]he instructions on the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt were general in nature, while the [instructions on the statutory presumption were] specific. We cannot conclude that the jury ignored the specific, erroneous instruction.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Indeed, after deliberating for a period, the jury asked Justice Garbarino for further instructions on the presumption. \u201cWhen a jury makes explicit its difficulties a trial judge should clear them away with concrete accuracy,\u201d <em>Bollenbach v. United States, </em>326 U.S. 607, 612-3, 66 S.Ct. 402, 405, 90 L.Ed. 350 (1946), but instead the judge, over the objections of counsel for all three defendants, merely repeated the substance of his earlier charge. Once again, he said that from \u201cthe mere fact that [the defendants] were arrested in the vehicle at the time that the cocaine was found,\u201d the People \u201cget the benefit of the presumption,\u201d so that, although rebuttal was possible, \u201cno proof is needed.\u201d After the foreman assured the judge that this exegesis would allow the jury to proceed, the jurors resumed their deliberations. Shortly thereafter, they indicated that they had reached agreement on the possession charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-10\">The faulty instruction therefore \u201cso infected the entire trial that the resulting convictionfs] violate[d] due process.\u201d <em>Cupp v. Naughten, </em>414 U.S. 141, 147, 94 S.Ct. 396, 38 L.Ed.2d 368 (1973). Accordingly, Judge Stewart\u2019s grant of Garcia\u2019s habeas corpus petition is affirmed.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1285-13\">. In the state courts the defendants argued that they had a right to know the identity of the informer. This issue is not presented by Garcia\u2019s habeas petition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1286-6\">. Shortly thereafter Barra repeated the point:</p>\n<p id=\"acc-dedup-1\">And the People rely on this presumption. And in the absence of a rebuttal. Presumption, having proved the automobile, the presence, the contraband in the car, I say that I have proven the guilt of each of these defendants beyond a reasonable doubt</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-7\">Justice Garbarino overruled defense objections to these statements.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1286-8\">. Like the prosecutor, the judge stressed this point. He added:</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-10\">In other words, what we are talking about now, is whether or not the People are entitled to the benefit of this presumption. And if they established it to your satisfaction the cocaine was in the car, the people were in the car at the time of the arrest, he\u2019s entitled to the presumption. He\u2019s entitled to the presumption which goes to their knowing of the presence of that stuff in the car, and therefore charging them with possession.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1286-16\">. The State claims that because Garcia did not seek Supreme Court .appellate review after the failure of her state appeals, she has not exhausted her state remedies under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. <em>Fay v. Noia, </em>372 U.S. 391, 435-36, 83 S.Ct. 822, 9 L.Ed.2d 837 (1963), eliminated this gloss on \u00a7 2254 concerning review by certiorari under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1257(3), and we decline to hold otherwise for appeals under \u00a7 1257(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1286-18\">. The petition was brought through her attorney, Frank Lopez, in the Southern District of New York, where she is incarcerated. We reject the contention that Judge Stewart abused his discretion by refusing to change the venue of this petition to the Eastern District, where Leyva had sought habeas. <em>Leyva v. Superintendent, </em>428 F.Supp. 1 (E.D.N.Y.1977), <em>vacated </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1191\">*1191</page-number><em>and remanded, </em>573 F.2d 1292 (2d Cir. 1978). Leyva had been released by the time Garcia\u2019s petition was filed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1287-8\">. The presumption was intended \u201cto enable the prosecution to make out a prima facie case,\u201d 38 N.Y.2d at 169, 379 N.Y.S.2d at 38, 341 N.E.2d at 552, and so was best classified in the category of \u201c[p]ermissible inferences\u201d or \u201cstatutorily authorized inferences,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 168, n. 3, 379 N.Y.S.2d 30, 341 N.E.2d 546.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1287-9\">. In <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>442 F.2d 698 (2d Cir. 1971) (en banc), <em>cert. denied sub nom. Ovalle v. United States, </em>404 U.S. 845, 92 S.Ct. 146, 30 L.Ed.2d 81 (1971), we applied the <em>Leary </em>test to uphold, with respect to dealership quantities of cocaine, a statute authorizing presumptions of importation and knowledge of importation from the fact of possession. <em>See id. </em>at 710. We find no need to address the question left open in <em>Leary, </em>whether a presumption satisfying the \u201cmore likely than not\u201d requirement must also comply with the criminal reasonable doubt standard. The Court in its most recent consideration of the matter explained that the latter test is met when \u201cthe evidence necessary to invoke the inference is sufficient for a rational juror to find the inferred fact beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Barnes v. United States, </em>412 U.S. 837, 843, 93 S.Ct. 2357, 2362, 37 L.Ed.2d 380 (1973). It suggested, <em>moreover, </em>that the two standards are separated by \u201cvariations in language and focus rather than [by] differences of substance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We, in any event, conclude that the connection between proven and presumed facts established by \u00a7 220.25(1) is sufficient, as applied to dealership quantities of narcotics, to satisfy either formulation of the Constitutional requirement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1288-9\">. This suffices to distinguish the present case from <em>Allen v. County Court, </em>568 F.2d 998 (2d Cir. 1977). In <em>Allen, </em>we invalidated N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 265.15(3), which in language nearly identical to that of \u00a7 220.25(1) made presence in a car with a firearm presumptive evidence of possession. Noting the absence of legislative findings to support the presumption, we found no rational basis for the inference of possession from presence. The holding, however, carefully distinguished the case of \u00a7 220.25(1), 568 F.2d at 1008 n. 18, because of the legislative history of the narcotics presumption. In addition, because the presence of drugs in an automobile is more suspicious than the presence of a gun, the likelihood of an occupant\u2019s innocence is correspondingly less when the contraband in question is narcotics and not firearms. <em>Id. </em>Finally, Judge Fuchsberg, who wrote the <em>Leyva </em>opinion, dissented from the state court opinion upholding the firearms presumption. <em>See People v. Lemmons, </em>40 N.Y.2d 505, 506, 387 N.Y.S.2d 97, 104, 354 N.E.2d 836, 843 (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1289-6\">. <em>Cf. Cupp v. Naughten, </em>414 U.S. 141, 94 S.Ct. 396, 38 L.Ed.2d 368 (1973). <em>Cupp </em>upheld, over objections to the trial judge\u2019s instruction that every witness is presumed to speak the truth, a state robbery conviction reached on the basis of eyewitness testimony. But the Court interpreted the instruction only as an attempt to \u201cgive [the jury] some guidance\u201d in evaluating the testimony, 414 U.S. at 149, 94 S.Ct. 396. The trial judge in <em>Cupp </em>explicitly instructed that the presumption might be overcome by the manner and nature of the witness\u2019s own testimony \u2014 unlike this case, where Justice Garbari-no did not charge that the jury could reject the conclusion of possession indicated by \u00a7 220.-25(1) because of the manner and nature of the presence as proven by the State. Indeed, whereas <em>Cupp </em>carefully pointed out that the trial judge had relieved the defendant of \u201cundue pressure\u201d to present testimony \u201cunder the belief that only positive testimony could engender disbelief of the State\u2019s witnesses,\u201d 414 U.S. at 149, 94 S.Ct. at 401, Justice Garbarino explicitly told counsel that he saw \u201cno authority for the statement that the direct of the People can also be used as satisfying the requirements of the defendants coming forth to rebut.\u201d The presumption accepted in <em>Cupp, </em>in short, was intended \u201cto get the jury off dead center,\u201d 414 U.S. at 149, 94 S.Ct. at 401, but the one we now reject carried the jurors all the way to a conclusion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1289-13\">. Accordingly, we cannot accept the contention of the New York Court of Appeals that the jury charge, while concededly lacking in precision, read as a whole passed constitutional muster. 38 N.Y.2d at 170, 397 N.Y.S.2d 30, 341 N.E.2d 546. This conclusion, which also disposes of the State\u2019s claim that any error in Justice Garbarino\u2019s charge was harmless, <em>cf. Stubbs v. Smith, </em>533 F.2d 64, 70-71 (2d Cir. 1976), is fortified by the fact that Justice Gar-barino overruled timely objections to Prosecutor Barra\u2019s insistence that he need only show the presence of the cocaine and the defendants in the car to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1289-14\">. Since Judge Stewart ordered that the writ should issue only if Garcia were not retried within 60 days and also stayed the writ pending this appeal, the State will have 60 days after the issuance of our mandate to retry Garcia.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
