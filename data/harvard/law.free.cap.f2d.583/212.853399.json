In its order of remand, the Court stated \u201cthe impact of the Voting Rights Act on the city ordinance and on the Charter amendment approved by referendum will be open on remand, and we deem it appropriate for the Court of Appeals to deal with these questions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">This Court invited counsel for the respective parties to file briefs \u201ctouching on these questions.\u201d By their several responses, the parties have consented to the entry of an order of this Court to the effect \u201cthat this requirement of Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act did apply to the legislative enactments of the City of Dallas; that the issue of preclearance is not rendered moot by the city\u2019s resolving to seek a declaratory judgment under Section 5; and that this matter should be remanded to the district court for any further relief necessary, including but not limited to the issue of appellants\u2019 attorneys fees and costs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">IT IS SO ORDERED.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">The case is REMANDED to the district court for further proceedings not inconsistent with the opinion of the Supreme Court and of this Order.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
