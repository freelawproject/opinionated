CAMPBELL, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b662-19\">Levitt &amp; Sons of Puerto Rico, Inc. (Levitt-Puerto Rico) appeals from a judgment for $357,000 in a diversity action brought against it by plaintiffs-appellees Jose M. Martinez Moll and Inez Cartagena Latorre. Central to plaintiffs\u2019 case was section 3374 of the Civil Code of Puerto Rico, which provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-20\">\u201cContracts shall only be valid between the parties who execute them and their heirs, .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-21\">Should the contract contain any stipulation in favor of a third person, he may demand its fulfillment, provided he has given notice of his acceptance to the person bound before it may have been revoked.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b662-22\">P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31 \u00a7 3374. Plaintiffs claimed that such a stipulation in their favor had been made in a contract between Levitt-Puerto Rico and Levitt &amp; Sons of Bayamon, Inc. (Levitt-Bayamon), an affiliate of Levitt-Puerto Rico, for sale of real estate formerly owned by appellees. The jury returned a special verdict accepting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>this theory, and judgment was thereupon entered. Levitt-Puerto Rico has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">On September 1, 1972, Levitt-Bayamon and appellees executed a public deed (Deed No. 38) for the purchase of appellees\u2019 121 cuerda farm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Levitt-Bayamon paid part of the purchase price of $1,190,000<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> before executing the deed, and gave appellees five promissory notes secured by a mortgage on the property for the balance of the price. The notes, each in the amount of $178,500, were due on the first of September of 1973, 1974, 1975, 1976, and 1977, respectively. Each note contained the following clause:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-8\">\u201cIn case of default on the part of the undersigned under the aforementioned mortgage or under this mortgage note, <em>the holder hereof shall have the right to look solely to the mortgaged property </em>for the collection of any unpaid amounts due thereunder and <em>the undersigned will not be personally liable.\u201d </em>[Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b663-9\">Levitt-Puerto Rico purchased the property from Levitt-Bayamon on February 7, 1975. The corporate affiliates made the transfer pursuant to a \u201cDeed of Purchase and Sale and Assumption of Mortgage\u201d (Deed No. 6), which contained the following language in its paragraph \u201cTHIRD\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-11\">\u201cThe Seller represents and warrants unto the Purchaser that the Property is completely free and clear of any and all charges, liens and encumbrances, <em>except for a purchase money mortgage which guarantees payment of five (5) promissory notes </em>in the principal amount of . ($178,500.00), each. . . . Payments having been made of the same, the Seller obtained the originals of the first two aforesaid promissory notes and by Deed Number One . . . Seller cancelled the same and partially cancelled the mortgage which guaranteed payment of the same, thereby reducing said mortgage to the current outstanding balance of principal of . ($535,500.00).\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b663-17\">Paragraph \u201cFOURTH\u201d read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-18\">\u201cHaving previously agreed thereon, the Seller hereby sells, transfers and conveys unto the Purchaser the Property together with all appurtenant rights ... in fee simple absolute (\u201cpleno dominio\u201d) under the following terms and conditions:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-19\">\u201cA) The purchase price for the property is the sum of ($1,320,-798.79).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-21\">\u201cB) The purchase price for the property is paid by the Purchaser to the Seller in the following manner: <em>Purchaser hereby assumes the mortgage indebtedness described in paragraph THIRD </em>above, with its present outstanding balance of principal of . ($535,500.00), retaining an equal amount from the purchase price to satisfy the same on its due date .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-23\">\u201cThe parties hereto clarify that they have separately computed the interest due since the last payment of the principal to the date hereof and that the Seller has separately reimbursed the Purchaser for the same so that upon the due date of the next installment of principal <em>the Purchaser will pay to the mortgagee the entire installment, </em>including all accrued interest.\u201d [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b663-24\">Appellees maintained that, read in light of certain oral and written communications between the parties, appellant\u2019s assumption of the mortgage indebtedness and above promise to pay the mortgagee were intended to and did create personal liability on appellant\u2019s part for the remaining $535,500, despite the non-recourse provisions in the original notes between Levitt-Bayamon and appellees. Appellees styled the assumption of indebtedness in Deed No. 6 a \u201cstipulation in favor of a third party\u201d which appellees could enforce pursuant to the provisions of \u00a7 3374 of the Civil Code, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b664-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>In August, 1975, Levitt-Puerto Rico informed appellees that it would not make payments on the last three promissory notes executed by Levitt-Bayamon, and offered to deed the remainder<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of the property back to appellees. Appellees refused this offer and in October, 1975, brought an \u201caction for collection of monies\u201d in the district court, seeking to recover the balance of the debt from Levitt-Puerto Rico.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">In a ruling on a pretrial motion, the district court held that the terms of Deed No. 6 (between Levitt-Puerto Rico and Levitt-Bayamon) were not conclusive of the existence of a stipulation to create personal liability to appellees.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Puerto Rican law therefore instructed that the intent of the contracting parties as proved by the acts of the parties should control the construction of the contract. P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, \u00a7 3471.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The focal inquiry at trial was thus whether Levitt-Puerto Rico \u201cintended to increase Plaintiffs [-Appellees\u2019] original rights of payment by becoming personally liable to Plaintiffs when Defendant [-Appellant] acquired\u201d the property from Levitt-Bayamon. The jury answered this query in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">1. <em>Sufficiency of the evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">Appellant argues that there was not enough evidence to submit the question of its alleged intent to the jury. However, appellant never questioned the sufficiency of the evidence in this regard when moving for a directed verdict, on other grounds, at the close of all the evidence.** Fed.R. Civ.P. 50(b) therefore barred appellant\u2019s belated assertion of the question in a post-verdict motion for judgment n. o. v.;<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and this court may not consider the sufficiency issue on appeal. <em>LaForest </em>v. <em>Autoridad de las Fuentes Fluviales, </em>536 F.2d 443 (1st Cir. 1976); <em>Sullmeyer v. Coca Cola Co., </em>515 F.2d 835, 846 &amp; n. 17 (5th Cir. 1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>424 U.S. 934, 96 S.Ct. 1148, 47 L.Ed.2d 341 (1976); <em>Gillentine v. McKeand, </em>426 F.2d 717, 722-23 (1st Cir. 1970); <em>see </em>9 C. Wright and A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure: Civil \u00a7 2537 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-14\">Appellant counters that it would have been futile for it to have moved for a directed verdict on insufficiency grounds at the close of all the evidence. It describes how, after defendant-appellant rested, plaintiffs-appellees moved for a directed verdict, arguing that the evidence conclusively established Levitt-Puerto Rico\u2019s intention to assume the indebtedness and Martinez Moll\u2019s acceptance of the stipulation in his favor. In refusing to direct a verdict for plaintiffs, the court explained, \u201cI think this a question of credibility in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>case and based purely on the question of intention. . . . \u201d Because the court\u2019s ruling on plaintiffs\u2019 motion purportedly indicated the court\u2019s intention to let the ease go to the jury, appellant argues that it was unnecessary for it to make a motion for a directed verdict on the converse ground of insufficiency in order to preserve the issue for appeal. As further proof of the district court\u2019s intention to send the case to the jury, appellant refers us to the court\u2019s statement in considering its later motion for j. n. o. v.: \u201c[Sjince the very time when the motion for summary judgment was brought before me [the case] came down to credibility issues. . . . [T]hese are classical issues for a jury and there was evidence sufficient on the record for the jury to . conclude . . . that there was an assumption of all the obligations [under the notes].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">However, plaintiffs\u2019 motion for directed verdict and the court\u2019s statements did not relieve appellant of the duty to file a separate motion of its own. The purpose of the Rule 50(b) requirement is to alert the opposing party to the movant\u2019s claim of insufficiency before the case goes to the jury, so that his opponent may possibly cure any deficiency in his case should the motion have merit, and also so that the judge may rule on the adequacy of the evidence without impinging on the jury\u2019s fact-finding province. <em>See Sullmeyer v. Coca Cola Co., supra at </em>846 n. 17; 5A Moore\u2019s Federal Practice 1 50.08 at 50-88 (1977). Defendant did nothing before verdict to alert either the plaintiffs or the court that it challenged the legal sufficiency of the evidence of intent. Plaintiffs\u2019 own motion for directed verdict did not serve this purpose, nor could the court\u2019s denial of plaintiffs\u2019 motion constitute a ruling on whether or not there was sufficient evidence to go to the jury. Whether to direct a verdict for a plaintiff is an altogether different question from whether a plaintiff\u2019s evidence is strong enough to survive a defense motion. A verdict seldom is directed for a plaintiff even on very strong evidence. The purposes of Rule 50(b) would be subverted were one party\u2019s motion for directed verdict to serve as his opponent\u2019s release from the Rule\u2019s requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-9\">It is true that the court\u2019s remarks both when ruling on plaintiffs\u2019 motion for directed verdict and, thereafter, when denying appellant\u2019s motion for judgment n. o. v., reflected an assumption that the evidence posed a jury issue. But compliance with Rule 50(b) is not excused by demonstrating, after the fact, that compliance would probably have been futile. The most that this and other courts have done by way of relaxing the Rule is to accept something less than full compliance where substantial compliance has been shown. In <em>Bayamon Thom McAn, Inc. v. Miranda, </em>409 F.2d 968 (1st Cir. 1969), defendants moved for a directed verdict on grounds of insufficiency at the end of plaintiffs\u2019 case, but did not renew the motion at the close of all the evidence. The district court expressly reserved ruling on the motion, however, declaring a firm intention to let the case go to the jury before it would apply a legal standard to the evidence. After the defendants briefly presented their rebuttal, the district court did submit the case to the jury, saying, \u201cIn view of the evidence submitted by the party plaintiff I decided to submit the case on the plaintiff\u2019s evidence.\u201d Once the verdict was rendered, the court invited defendants to make their motion for j. n. o. v., and ruled on it on the merits. In those circumstances, where a proper, albeit premature, motion had been made, and where the court by reserving ruling and by other actions had demonstrated its disposition to let the case go to the jury, we found that the district court had led counsel reasonably to believe that all had been done that was necessary to preserve the issue for review. We further noted the brief and inconsequential nature of the evidence introduced following defendants\u2019 first motion for directed verdict. <em>Compare Gillentine v. McKeand, supra </em>at 722-23. We emphasized, however, that we were not signalling that the compliance with Rule 50(b) was unnecessary: \u201c[Procedural wrangles would multiply if the requirement could be deemed nonessential upon a mere showing of a court\u2019s con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>tinuing disinclination to grant such a motion.\u201d <em>Bayamon Thom McAn, supra </em>at 971.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">The present case is obviously distinguishable from <em>Bayamon Thom McAn. </em>First, Levitt never moved on insufficiency grounds, or raised the issue at all, until after the jury\u2019s verdict, when it was too late. There is thus no basis, as there was in <em>Bayamon Thom McAn, </em>for treating the present ease as one where there was substantial compliance with the Rule. Second, the court did nothing that could reasonably have caused Levitt to believe that all had been done that was necessary to preserve the issue for review. Appellant offers no excuse for its failure to comply with the Rule other than the ad hoc supposition of futility \u2014 a reason which, as indicated in <em>Bayamon Thom McAn, </em>is by itself not enough. <em>See id. </em>at 971.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">The Seventh Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Pittsburgh-Des Moines Steel Co. v. Brookhaven Manor Water Co., </em>532 F.2d 572 (7th Cir. 1976), cited by appellant, is similarly distinguishable. The appellant\u2019s evidentiary argument had been presented to the court before the case was sent to the jury, and the court \u201chad firmly taken the position . . . that the jury was going to have the first opportunity to decide the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 577. It is true that in <em>Pittsburgh-Des Moines, </em>as here, the opposing party did not register any objection to the court\u2019s ruling on the merits of the j. n. o. v. motion, and the court disposed of that motion on the merits. Appellants would have us treat such factors as a waiver of the Rule 50(b) bar. But <em>Pittsburgh-Des Moines </em>does not create any such far-reaching waiver rule. The Seventh Circuit looked at appellant\u2019s failure to object and the district court\u2019s substantive ruling merely as further evidence of the participants\u2019 understanding that the motion had been properly made pre-verdict and the issue saved for review. <em>Id. </em>at 575-76. Here a parallel argument fails for lack of the appropriate pre-verdict predicate. Appellant cites no further support for the waiver argument, nor do we think a waiver rule would be tenable in these circumstances: were such a rule adopted, the important purposes of Rule 50(b) could too easily be foiled by an opposing party\u2019s reluctance to object when it seemed probable that the court would rule in its favor without intervention, or by the district court\u2019s reluctance to deny the j. n. o. v. motion on procedural grounds when it seemed more satisfactory to refer to the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-8\">Last, appellant submits that even without technical compliance with the Rule, this court should either reverse or remand for plain error if it finds no evidence to support the verdict. <em>See House of Koskot Development Corp. </em>v. <em>American Line Cosmetics, Inc., </em>468 F.2d 64, 67 (5th Cir. 1972); <em>Little v. Bankers Life &amp; Casualty Co., </em>426 F.2d 509, 511 (5th Cir. 1970). This circuit has acknowledged that in an \u201cexceptional\u201d case it is empowered to correct \u201cplain error\u201d to avert a \u201cclear miscarriage of justice\u201d in a civil action, despite counsel\u2019s failure to preserve his client\u2019s rights. <em>Morris v. Travisono, </em>528 F.2d 856, 859 (1st Cir. 1976); <em>Nimrod v. Sylvester, </em>369 F.2d 870, 873 (1st Cir. 1966). We have yet to find plain error in a civil proceeding, however, and we are not persuaded that the present case presents the appropriate circumstances, although we acknowledge that appellant\u2019s insufficiency claim is not frivolous. This case posed no particular evidentiary or legal difficulty, nor did the district court\u2019s rulings mislead. <em>See Giacalone v. Raytheon Mfg. Co., </em>222 F.2d 249, 251-52 (1st Cir. 1955). The case is not so peculiar nor the injustice so clear, <em>see Nimrod v. Sylvester, supra, </em>that we are disposed to relieve appellant of its own error.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-9\">We accordingly decline to consider if there was sufficient evidence for the jury to find an intention by the two companies to benefit plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-10\">2. <em>The legal effect of the stipulation in Deed No. 6</em></p>\n<p id=\"b666-11\">Related to the foregoing matter, but to some degree different, is appellant\u2019s contention that as a matter of Puerto Rican law, the language in Deed No. 6 did not allow plaintiffs to impose personal liability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>on Levitt-Puerto Rico under third party beneficiary doctrine whatever the other evidence bearing on intent. Appellees repeat their protest that appellant is barred from raising this objection since it did not do so in the district court. In response, appellant points to its motion for summary judgment, and later, to its motion for j. n. o. v. But the j. n. o. v. motion is of no help, since the question had not been earlier raised in a motion for directed verdict as required by Rule 50(b). And our examination of appellant\u2019s motion for summary judgment and its \u201cOpposition to plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment and in support of defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment\u201d does not reveal that this point was called to the court\u2019s attention there. Appellant rather urged, on the basis of its president\u2019s deposition as well as the deed, that it never demonstrated any intention to undertake personal liability, arguing that \u201cthe intention of the contracting parties [must] prevail even in the face of seemingly explicit language to the contrary.\u201d In ruling on plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment the district court indicated that it had a similar understanding of appellant\u2019s position: <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u201c[T]he parties essentially rely on the intention of Defendant in entering into the contract.\u201d See <em>supra </em>note 6. At a later point, defendant-appellant proposed that the question whether there was a stipulation at all in the contract be submitted to the jury. Nowhere in its pretrial motions did appellant contend that as a matter of Puerto Rican law the assumption clause of Deed No. 6 ruled out any finding \u2014 whatever the other evidence \u2014 that plaintiffs were third party beneficiaries of a stipulation to pay the entire indebtedness. Because this is a question of Puerto Rican legal doctrine on which it would be especially important to have ruling by a local district judge, <em>see Berrios Rivera v. British Ropes, Ltd., </em>575 F.2d 966 (1st Cir. 1978), and because the local law question is not one whose resolution is obvious from the statute and cases cited to us, we adhere to our rule of not considering issues not first presented to the district court. <em>Dobb v. Baker, </em>505 F.2d 1041, 1044 (1st Cir. 1974); <em>Bird </em>v. <em>United States, </em>241 F.2d 516, 520-21 (1st Cir. 1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">3. <em>Attorneys\u2019 fees</em></p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">Appellant maintains that the district court erred by permitting an award of attorneys\u2019 fees to be included in the judgment. The court awarded appellees attorneys\u2019 fees to be calculated in accordance with the terms of the promissory notes. The notes provided that 10 percent of the amount due would be recoverable as attorneys\u2019 fees in the event of default. Appellant argues that since appellees were not suing on the notes, but on the stipulation in Deed No. 6 (in order to avoid the non-recourse provisions of the notes), they were not entitled to enforce the terms of the notes.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">The district court ruled that \u201cthere was sufficient evidence ... to conclude . that there was an assumption of all the obligations thereunder [/. e., under the notes] including the payment of interest and attorneys\u2019 fees as stated in the notes . .\u201d We see no cause to disturb this ruling. The basic terms of the indebtedness were evidenced by the notes. Appellees maintained that Levitt-Puerto Rico modified the terms of this indebtedness by assuming personal liability and abrogating the non-recourse provisions of the notes. This modification need not have encompassed abrogation of all the terms of the notes, and the district court was not clearly erroneous in concluding that the attorneys\u2019 fees provision was part and parcel of appellant\u2019s assumption of indebtedness.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-8\">4. <em>Standing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b667-9\">Last, Levitt-Puerto Rico submits that since at the time of suit appellees were no longer holders of the three outstanding notes but had pledged them as collateral to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>a bank,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> appellees lacked standing to bring this suit. We think this claim has no merit. As the district court ruled, plaintiffs were still owners of the notes when they brought suit, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, \u00a7 5027, and therefore retained sufficient interest in the indebtedness to bring this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">Appellant now attempts to recast its standing argument, explaining that the essence of the contention was that the proceedings below were defective because the Bank \u2014 an allegedly indispensable party under Fed.R.Civ.P. 19 \u2014 was not joined. This deficiency, Levitt-Puerto Rico maintains, has subjected it to the risk of double liability. Despite appellant\u2019s failure to raise this contention below, it is properly before us: joinder of a Rule 19 indispensable party may not be waived. Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(h)(2); <em>see In re Las Colinas, Inc., </em>426 F.2d 1005, 1015 n. 19 (1st Cir. 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">We do not consider that the bank was an indispensable party insofar as the district court was called on to determine the issue of Levitt-Puerto Rico\u2019s personal liability to Martinez Moll. The Bank could add nothing to determination of the question of Levitt-Puerto Rico\u2019s intent in assuming the mortgage indebtedness of Levitt-Bayamon. Insofar as a judgment will be enforced against Levitt-Puerto Rico, the Bank\u2019s interest in the notes is more significant. But the extent of that interest has not been examined on the record since the question was not put to the district court. If appel-lees have been meeting the terms of the loan, the Bank\u2019s interest in the notes may yet be contingent, and the value of the collateral purely a matter for Martinez and the Bank to resolve. If, however, Martinez has defaulted on the loan, the Bank may attempt to collect from Levitt-Puerto Rico on the notes. The relative rights of the parties in such an event are determined by Puerto Rican law, but the Bank\u2019s status in this proceeding would still depend on the considerations outlined in Rule 19. If join-der is possible before the entry of final judgment, it may be advisable. In the alternative, payment of the judgment might be conditioned on plaintiffs\u2019 obtaining a release of collateral from the Bank, as appellant suggests. This is a question for the district court. We therefore remand the case for consideration of the limited question of the Bank\u2019s status under Rule 19 and direct that the district court modify its judgment in this regard as it deems appropriate after further fact-finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed subject to modification by the district court upon remand for the limited purpose set forth in this opinion.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b663-14\">.

Pursuant to the terms of Deed No. 38, the land could be \u201cliberated\u201d from the risk of foreclosure upon payment of each note at the rate of $10,000 per cuerda.
