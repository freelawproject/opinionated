The decision became a final agency order when the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission (the Commission) declined to review it.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-21\">In early July, 1976, National, a construction company, was engaged in the construction of the Gerald Gentlemen Station (the Project), a fossil fuel power plant. On July 6, 1976, during construction, Gerald Benton, a National ironworker, fell fifty-four feet and suffered serious injuries. The next day, an OSHA compliance officer visited the Project to investigate the accident. On August 3,1976, two citations were issued in which National was accused of violating several OSHA regulations. National filed a timely notice contesting the citations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-22\">On October 1, 1976, the Secretary of Labor filed a complaint with the Commission essentially setting forth the allegations contained in the citations. After an evidentia-ry hearing, the Administrative Law Judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1050\">*1050</page-number>filed his decision and order. He held that National had violated 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1926.-450(a)(1) (1977), a serious violation, and 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1926.21(b)(2) (1977), a nonserious violation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1146-4\">In this appeal, National contends that: (1) 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1926<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> was not validly promulgated by the Secretary of Labor; (2) the Secretary\u2019s complaint should have been dismissed because under Commission Rule 33(a)(1), 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2200.33(a)(1) (1977), it was not timely filed; (3) 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1926.-21(b)(2) is unenforceably vague; and (4) there is insubstantial evidence in the record to support the violations.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1146-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1146-6\">PROMULGATION OF 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1926 A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1146-7\">Under Section 6 of OSHA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 655 (1970), the Secretary of Labor is authorized to promulgate standards<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> to further the objectives of OSHA. Section 6(b), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 655(b) (1970), enumerates the procedures with which the Secretary must comply when promulgating new standards. Under Section 6(a), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 655(a) (1970), however, the Secretary may avoid these procedures as well as the notice and publication requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), <em>see </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553 (1976), by adopting, as an OSHA Standard, \u201cany established Federal standard.\u201d Established federal standards are defined in OSHA as \u201cany operative occupational safety and health standard established by any agency of the United States and presently in effect.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 652(10) (1970). Because OSHA became effective April 28, 1971, any federal safety and health regulation in effect on that date could be summarily adopted by the Secretary and included in OSHA\u2019s regulation under Section 6(a) as an \u201cestablished Federal standard.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1146-14\">Acting under Section 6(a) of OSHA, the Secretary adopted, as OSHA regulations, 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1926 (1977), <em>see supra </em>note 5, which had been promulgated pursuant to Section 107 of the Construction Safety Act, 40 U.S.C. \u00a7 333 (1970). National argues that the Construction Safety Act regulations had not been validly promulgated and were not \u201cestablished Federal standards.\u201d Thus, they could not have been adopted by the Secretary as OSHA regulations under Section 6(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1146-15\">Section 107 of the Construction Safety Act requires the Secretary of Labor, in promulgating regulations, to comply with the requirements of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553 (1976) of the APA. Section 553 requires, <em>inter alia, </em>that proposed regulations be published in the Federal Register for thirty days prior to the date upon which they become effective unless the agency finds good cause justifying a shortened publication period.</p>\n<p id=\"b1146-16\">The Construction Safety Act regulations were published in the Federal Register for seven and ten days prior to their effective date rather than for thirty days as specified in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553 (1976) of the APA. <em>See </em>36 Fed.Reg. 7340 (1971), <em>infra </em>note 7. The Secretary included a statement of \u201cgood cause\u201d in support of his decision to expedite the effective date of the regulations.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1147-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1051\">*1051</page-number>National points out that the Construction Safety Act regulations became effective on April 27, 1971, one day before OSHA\u2019s effective date. Had the Secretary not expedited publication of these regulations, they would not have been existing federal standards on April 28, 1971, the date OSHA became effective, and the Secretary, in promulgating the regulations as OSHA standards, would have had to comply with the more detailed promulgation requirements of Section 6(b) of OSHA. National implies that the Secretary\u2019s desire to promulgate summarily the Construction Safety Act regulations as OSHA standards was the Secretary\u2019s principal reason for shortening the period of publication in the Federal Register. National argues that the Secretary incorrectly categorized the Construction Safety Act regulations as appropriate for expedition under the good cause exception in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553(d)(2) (1976). Thus, National argues, because the Secretary did not publish the Construction Safety Act regulations in the Federal Register for thirty days as the APA requires and erroneously relied upon the good cause exception, the regulations were not \u201cexisting Federal standards\u201d and could not have been summarily adopted by the Secretary as OSHA regulations under Section 6(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1147-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1147-6\">Before addressing National\u2019s claim that 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1926 was invalidly promulgated, we must initially decide whether a party may raise in this enforcement proceeding the Secretary\u2019s failure to comply procedurally with the publication requirements of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553 (1976) of the APA.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1147-8\">Under Section 6(f) of OSHA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 655(f) (1970), the statute provides for pre-enforcement review of standards promulgated by the Secretary of Labor. This provision permits a party, who may be adversely affected by an OSHA standard, to challenge its validity in a United States court of appeals within sixty days from the time the standard becomes effective.</p>\n<p id=\"b1147-9\">National did not proceed under Section 6(f). Rather, it raised the manner in which 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1926 had been promulgated as a defense in the enforcement proceeding instituted by the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b1147-10\">The Agency, relying upon <em>Daniel Construction Co., </em>OSHRC Docket Nos. 7734 &amp; 7672 (Feb. 10, 1977), [1976-1977] Occup.Saf. &amp; Health Dec. (CCH) It 21,521, in which the Commission sustained the Secretary\u2019s reliance on \u201cgood caus\u00e9\u201d in support of his decision to publish the Safety Act regulations in the Federal Register for less than thirty days, rejected National\u2019s promulgation claim. National then filed this action under Section 11(a) of OSHA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 660(a) (1970), to review the Agency\u2019s decision. In this appeal, National renewed its claim that the regulations had been invalidly promulgated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1147-11\">We must decide whether procedural claims of invalidity may be raised in an enforcement proceeding before the Commission from which appeals are taken to this Court under Section 11(a) of OSHA, or whether such claims must exclusively be made in this Court under Section 6(f) of OSHA within sixty days from the time the regulations become effective.</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1052\">*1052</page-number>Congress has discussed the scope intended for pre-enforcement review under Section 6(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-4\">While [Section 6(f)] would be the exclusive method for obtaining pre-enforcement judicial review of a standard, the provision does not foreclose an employer from challenging the validity of a standard during an enforcement proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"aje-dedup-0\">S.Rep.No.91-1282, 91st Cong., 2d Sess. <em>reprinted in </em>[1970] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News, pp. 5177, 5184.</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-5\">It seems apparent that, at least for substantive attacks, Congress did not intend pre-enforcement review under Section 6(f) to be the exclusive method for challenging the validity of a regulation. At least one court of appeals has held that the substantive validity of a regulation may be raised in an enforcement proceeding under Section 11(a), as well as under Section 6(f) of OSHA. <em>See Atlantic &amp; Gulf Stevedores v. OSHRC, </em>534 F.2d 541, 549-550 (3d Cir. 1976). <em>See also Arkansas-Best Freight Systems, Inc. v. OSHRC, </em>529 F.2d 649, 652-653 (8th Cir. 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-6\">When Congress has provided more than one avenue of judicial review, an employer\u2019s right to challenge on substantive grounds an allegedly arbitrary or unreasonable regulation should not be limited to a period prior to enforcement immediately following the regulation\u2019s effective date.</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-7\">Because the filing of a pre-enforcement petition to review will not ordinarily operate as a stay of the standard, <em>see </em>\u00a7 6(f), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 655(f), enforcement proceedings may commence before even an initial determination of validity has been made. Unless the Commission is authorized to consider defenses of invalidity, it will be reduced to rubber-stamping possibly invalid citations, and employers will for an interim period be deprived of any remedy for sanctions imposed contrary to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-8\">Moreover, it may become evident that a particular safety standard is economically or technically infeasible, or otherwise unreasonable, only after employers have made good faith efforts to comply. These problems may manifest themselves well after the 60-day period for pre-en-forcement review has expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-10\"><em>Atlantic &amp; Gulf Stevedores v. OSHRC, supra </em>534 F.2d at 549-550.</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-11\">Procedural attacks, on the other hand, implicate different interests. An employer\u2019s interest in invalidating an otherwise reasonable regulation solely because the Secretary has failed to comply with the APA\u2019s procedural requirements is, in our view, distinguishable from attacks on the reasonableness or feasibility of the regulation. While the unreasonableness of a regulation may only become apparent after a period during which an employer has made a good faith effort to comply, procedural irregularities need not await the test of time and can be raised immediately. The agency\u2019s interest in finality, coupled with the burden of continuous procedural challenges raised whenever an agency attempts to enforce a regulation, dictates against providing a perpetual forum in which the Secretary\u2019s procedural irregularities may be raised. Were there no limitation upon the time within which procedural attacks could be made, the resulting uncertainty might inhibit employers, otherwise able and willing, from complying with a regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-12\">While no court of appeals has specifically decided this question, the Third Circuit has recognized the distinction between substantive and procedural claims of invalidity. <em>See Atlantic &amp; Gulf Stevedores v. OSHRC, supra </em>534 F.2d at 551-552. There, the Court intimated that, in an enforcement proceeding, an employer may not defend solely on the ground that the Secretary has Ignored certain procedural requirements. Rather, it must produce evidence why the regulation under attack is arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1148-13\">We think there is merit to the distinction between substantive and procedural claims of invalidity and hold that a challenge to the validity of an OSHA regulation, based solely upon the Secretary\u2019s failure to comply with the procedural requirements of the APA, OSHA, or any other applicable statute, may only be raised in a pre-enforcement proceeding instituted pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1053\">*1053</page-number>suant to Section 6(f) of OSHA within sixty days from the time the regulation becomes effective. Such attacks may not be raised in an enforcement proceeding. Sixty days, in our view, provides a reasonable period during which procedural challenges can be raised. National is, therefore, barred from raising the procedural invalidity of 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1926 in this action.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1149-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-6\">National next complains that the Secretary\u2019s complaint ought to have been dismissed because it was not filed within the twenty-day time limit prescribed in Commission Rule 33(a)(1), 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2200.-33(a)(1) (1977).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1149-7\">The Commission concedes that its complaint was filed forty-two days after National\u2019s notice of contest was received, twenty-two days late. The Commission argues, however, that under Commission Rule 38, 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2200.38 (1977),<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the Administrative Law Judge has discretion to excuse a failure to comply with the Commission\u2019s rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-16\">Despite a lack of unanimity among the OSHA Commissioners, a majority has held that an untimely complaint should be dismissed only when there has been prejudice to the employer. <em>See Secretary of Labor v. Jensen Construction Co. of Oklahoma, </em>OSHRC Docket Nos. 12940, 12947, 13196 (June 6, 1977), [1977] 5 Occup. Saf. &amp; Health Cas. 1780; <em>Secretary of Labor v. Rollins Outdoor Advertising, Inc., </em>OSHRC Docket No. 12528 (Feb. 22, 1977), [1977] 5 Occup.Saf. &amp; Health Cas. 1041. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1054\">*1054</page-number>We agree with the majority. A review of the record convinces us that National has failed to allege sufficient facts in support of its claim of prejudice in this action. Thus, we are satisfied the Administrative Law Judge did not abuse its discretion under Commission Rule 38 in refusing to dismiss the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-5\">National also argues that 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1926.21(b)(2) (1977), which it was held to have violated, provides inadequate notice to employers of the conduct required and is unenforceably vague. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1926.-21(b)(2) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-6\">The employer shall instruct each employee in the recognition and avoidance of unsafe conditions and the regulations applicable to his work environment to control or eliminate any hazards or other exposure to illness or injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-7\">In determining whether an administrative regulation provides adequate notice, courts have inquired whether an employer familiar with the circumstances of the industry could reasonably be expected to have had adequate warning of the conduct required by the regulation. <em>See Hoffman Construction Co. v. OSHRC, </em>546 F.2d 281, 283 (9th Cir. 1976); <em>Cape &amp; Vinyard Division v. OSHRC, </em>512 F.2d 1148, 1152 (1st Cir. 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-8\">Recently, a majority of the Commission has sustained the validity of 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1926.21(b)(2) (1977) against a vagueness attack. <em>See Secretary of Labor v. Henkels &amp; McCoy, Inc., </em>OSHRC Docket No. 8842 (Aug. 3,1976), [1976] 4 Occup.Saf. &amp; Health Cas. 1502. There, the Commission held that the provision, while broad, is clear and requires: \u201c(1) instruction in safety measures and applicable regulations, and (2) instructions on how employees may recognize and thereby avoid unsafe conditions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 9-10.</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-12\"> Regulations so vague that people of common intelligence must guess at their meaning and application do not provide adequate notice. We agree with the Commission, however, that 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1926.21(b)(2) (1977) sufficiently warns employers of the conduct required and is not impermissibly vague. The regulation, at a minimum, requires that an employer apprise its employees of applicable regulations and issue general instructions on how employees may recognize and avoid dangerous conditions.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1150-13\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-14\">Finally, National argues that there is insubstantial evidence in the record to support the violations. The scope of our review in OSHA cases is provided in Section 11(a) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 660(a) (1970), which provides in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-15\">The findings of the Commission with respect to questions of fact, if supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole, shall be conclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"amp-dedup-0\"><em>See Beall Construction Co. v. OSHRC, </em>507 F.2d 1041, 1046 (8th Cir. 1974). <em>See generally Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, </em>340 U.S. 474, 479-491, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-16\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-17\">29 C.F.R \u00a7 1926.450(a)(1)</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-18\">29 C.F.R \u00a7 1926.450(a)(1) (1977) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"aqb-dedup-0\">Except where either permanent or temporary stairways or suitable ramps or runways are provided, ladders described in this subpart shall be used to give safe access to all elevations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-19\">The Commission argues that National failed to provide safe access to the area on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1055\">*1055</page-number>elevation 3263 where Benton was working on July 6, 1976, the day of the accident and that the diagonal beams used by the employees provided the only access. National argues that there were two safe ways employees could have gotten to the work area<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and that the regulation only requires an employer to furnish access to elevations, not all points on an elevation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-4\">The Administrative Law Judge, noting the testimony was conflicting, found the Commission\u2019s witnesses to be more convincing than National\u2019s and held that National had violated 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1926.-450(a)(1) (1977). We are satisfied that the Judge\u2019s conclusion has substantial evidentiary support in the record as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-5\">Randy Craig, testifying for the Commission, stated that there were no temporary or permanent stairways, walkways, or ramps on July 6 and 7 leading to his work area on elevation 3263. Employees had to climb diagonal beams which, due to heavy use by employees, had become slick. Craig conceded, during cross-examination, that there was a permanent stairway leading to elevation 3263 but there was no ramp or other means of getting to the work area. The testimony of the OSHA compliance officer who inspected the project on July 7, 1976, supports Craig\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-6\">We reject National\u2019s argument that 29 C.F.R \u00a7 1926.450(a)(1) requires access only to elevations rather than all work areas on an elevation. Regulations should be given a reasonable, commonsense interpretation. If the standard only required access to an elevation but did not compel employers to provide a reasonably safe way of getting from that point to a particular work area on an elevation, it would be rendered useless.</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-9\">29 C.F.R \u00a7 1926.21(b)(2)</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-10\">As indicated above, 29 C.F.R \u00a7 1926.-21(b)(2) requires an employer to \u201cinstruct each employee in the recognition and avoidance of unsafe conditions and the regulations applicable to his work environment to control or eliminate any hazards or other exposure to illness or injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-11\">National argues that the record does not support a finding of a violation and clearly shows National had a more than adequate safety program including orientation and periodic safety meetings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-12\">The Administrative Law Judge found that National\u2019s employees were climbing diagonal beams to gain access to their work area. He also found that a National supervisor was aware of this activity, and not only failed to instruct the employees about the hazards associated with it but instructed the injured employee, who was experiencing difficulty climbing the diagonal, to rest before continuing. The judge held that 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1926.21(b)(2) (1977) requires more than a general safety program. It requires supervisory personnel when they observe activity that is hazardous or viola-tive of a regulation to instruct workers accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-13\">Our review of the record satisfies us that the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s factual findings are substantially supported. National\u2019s safety engineer testified that during the orientation program, as well as the weekly safety meetings, employees were instructed about proper means of access to an elevated area and were told not to climb diagonal beams. Randy Craig, a National ironworker, with whom Benton, the injured worker, was working on the day of the accident, testified that he was not specifically advised about climbing the di<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1056\">*1056</page-number>agonal beams to his work area. Craig also testified, as the Administrative Law Judge found, that a National foreman knew of the climbing activity but neglected to instruct employees of the hazards associated with it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-4\">While there appears to be some conflicting testimony over whether employees were informed not to climb diagonal beams, the record is clear that a National foreman was aware of the activity but did not instruct employees to cease. We agree with the Administrative Law Judge that 29 C.F.R \u00a7 1926.21(b)(2) (1977) requires more than a general safety program. Reasonably applied, the standard requires supervisory personnel to advise employees, especially new employees, of the hazards associated- with actual dangerous conduct in which they are presently engaging. <em>See Secretary of Labor v.

The rules are applied only to new construction contracts which are advertised on or after the seventh day following publication of this document in the Federal Register. In the case of negotiated construction contracts, the rules shall be effective as to new contracts of this nature for which negotiations are commenced on or after 10 days following publication of this document in the Federal Register. The time lag in the procurement process, together with the time periods specified, are considered sufficient to afford affected persons reasonable time to take such action as may be necessary to comply with the rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b1147-13\">36 Fed.Reg. 7340 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b1147-14\">The Secretary also stated that the regulations were within the \u201cpublic contracts\u201d exception to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553 (1976) and were exempt from its requirements. Because of our holding, we need not discuss the applicability of the public contracts exception in this context.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1147-15\">. We purposely distinguish National\u2019s \u201cprocedural\u201d attack on the validity of the regulations with a claim that the regulations are arbitrary or unreasonable, which we label \u201csubstantive.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1149-8\">. In <em>Daniel Construction Co., </em>OSHRC Docket Nos. 7734 &amp; 7672 (Feb. 10, 1977), [1976-1977] Occup.Saf. &amp; Health Dec. (CCH) fl 21,521, the Commission held that the Secretary\u2019s statement of good cause, <em>see supra </em>note 7, justified the shortened period during which the Construction Safety Act regulations were published in the Federal Register.</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-9\">Were this a pre-enforcement proceeding brought under Section 6(f) of OSHA within sixty days from the time the regulations became effective, we would have great difficulty, based on the Secretary\u2019s statement of good cause, upholding his reliance on the good cause exception in support of his decision to expedite publication of these regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-10\">We note that the House Report, in explaining the rationale for permitting a shortened publication period, has stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-11\">Many rules * * * may be made operative in less than 30 days because of inescapable or unavoidable limitations of time, because of the demonstrable urgency of the conditions they are designed to correct, and because the parties subject to them may during the usually protracted hearing and decision procedures anticipate the regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"aef-dedup-0\">H.Rep.No.1980, 79th Cong., 2d Sess. (1945), <em>reprinted in </em>Administrative Procedure Act, Legislative History 79th Cong. 1944-1946 at 260.</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-12\">The Senate Report states:</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-13\">The [good cause exception] * * * is not an \u201cescape clause\u201d which may be arbitrarily exercised but requires legitimate grounds supported in law and fact by the required finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-14\">S.Rep.No.752, 79th Cong., 1st Sess. (1946), <em>reprinted in </em>Administrative Procedure Act, Legislative History 79th Cong. 1944 \u2014 1946 at 201.</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-17\">Similarly, the cases defining the scope of good cause have required some showing of urgency or immediacy that does not appear to have been alleged by the Secretary in the present action. See, e. <em>g., Buckeye Cablevision, Inc. v. F. C. </em>C, 128 U.S.App.D.C. 262, 270 n.34, 387 F.2d 220, 228 n.34 (1967); <em>Minden Beef Co. v. Cost of Living Council, </em>362 F.Supp. 298, 304-305 (D.Neb.1973). We cannot ignore the Secretary\u2019s timing in this case. The Construction Safety Act regulations became effective one day prior to April 28, 1971, the effective date of OSHA. Had they been published in the Federal Register for thirty days, the Secretary could not have summarily adopted them as \u201cexisting Federal standards\u201d under Section 6(a) of OSHA. If this were, in fact, the principal reason for shortening the publication period, it would not of itself satisfy \u201cgood cause\u201d as the cases and Congress have defined it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1149-18\">. Under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 661(f) (1970), the Commission is authorized \u201cto make such rules as are necessary for the orderly transaction of its proceedings.\u201d Pursuant to its authority under \u00a7 661(f), the Commission promulgated 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2200 (1977). 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2200.33(a)(1) (1977) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-19\">The Secretary shall file a complaint with the Commission no later than 20 days after his receipt of notice of contest.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1149-20\">. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2200.38 (1977) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-21\">Failure to file any pleading pursuant to these rules when due, may, in the discretion of the Commission or the judge, constitute a waiver of the right to further participation in the proceedings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1150-9\">. National argues not only that the regulation provides no notice and is unenforceably vague, but that 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1926.21(b)(2) (1977) fails to meet the definition of a standard contained in Section 3(8) of OSHA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 652(8) (1970), which provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-10\">The term \u201coccupational safety and .health standard\" means a standard which requires conditions, or the adoption or use of one or more practices, means, methods, operations, or processes, reasonably necessary or appropriate to provide safe or healthful employment and places of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-21\">We are satisfied that 29 C.F.R \u00a7 1926.21(b)(2) (1977) falls within this rather broad definition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1151-7\">. National\u2019s safety engineer testified that there were two methods by which employees could safely have gotten to the area on elevation 3263 at which Gerald Benton and Randy Craig were working on July 6, 1976. First, employees could have climbed a permanent stairway in the southwest corner and then used a lifeline and pick board (a temporary ramp) to obtain access from the stairway to the work area. Second, employees could have reached elevation 3263 either by climbing the permanent stairway or by utilizing a personal hoist. Then by \u201ccooning\u201d (a safety belt tied around the beam), which provided lateral access, employees could have reached the work area.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
