The death occurred on March 17, 1975, when the agent, his gun drawn, surprised gunmen in the process of robbing Francisco Dominguez, the proprietor of a grocery store. When one of the robbers pointed a gun at him the agent fired twice, killing both the robber and Dominguez, who was holding on to the assailant. Following the Government\u2019s filing of its answer denying liability, no pretrial discovery, motions or other formal actions were taken by either side until December, 1976, when Judge Platt, to whom the case had been assigned, notified the parties that he would hold a pretrial conference with the parties on February 11, 1977, a date that was later postponed to February 18, 1977.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-15\">When neither appellant nor her counsel, Andres Astacio Santos, Esq., appeared at the conference on February 18, 1977, the court dismissed the action pursuant to Rule 41(b), F.R.Civ.P. and Rule 8(a) of the Individual Assignment and Calendar Rules of the Eastern District.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On the same date <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>the U.S. Attorney wrote Santos a letter by certified mail advising him of the dismissal and requesting that if he intended to move to vacate the dismissal he should do so within 10 days of the receipt of the U.S. Attorney\u2019s letter, which was received by Santos on March 5, 1977.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">Instead of moving immediately to vacate the dismissal Santos visited the Assistant U.S. Attorney in charge of the case and was advised that unless he promptly moved to reinstate the case the Government would oppose any such application. Notwithstanding this warning, Santos did nothing until January 26, 1978, more than 10 months later, when he moved pursuant to Rule 60(b), F.R.Civ.P., to vacate the February 18, 1977, dismissal on grounds of excusable neglect. Santos\u2019 excuses for his inaction were that he had been misinformed by Judge Platt\u2019s law clerk regarding the scheduled pretrial conference <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and that thereafter, following a structural cave-in of the floor of his office on May 27, 1977, his files and records were removed to the basement of the building and became inaccessible until December, 1977.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">After hearing the Rule 60(b) motion on February 17, 1978, Judge Platt, on March 13, 1978, filed a memorandum opinion and order denying the motion. He concluded that the circumstances did not amount to excusable neglect within the meaning of Rule 60(b) and that appellant\u2019s counsel had not moved within a reasonable time to vacate the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-12\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b713-13\">We agree with Judge Platt\u2019s findings and conclusions. Indeed, the conduct of appellant\u2019s counsel appears to have been so grossly negligent and irresponsible as to call for an investigation into his competency to practice before the federal bar. By no stretch of the imagination could his 10-month delay in moving to vacate the dismissal be characterized as \u201cexcusable neglect\u201d within the meaning of Rule 60(b). See <em>Slumbertogs, Inc. </em>v. <em>Jiggs, Inc., </em>353 F.2d 720 (2d Cir. 1965), <em>cert. denied, </em>383 U.S. 969, 86 S.Ct. 1276, 76 L.Ed.2d 309 (1966); <em>Standard Newspapers, Inc. v. King, </em>375 F.2d 115 (2d Cir. 1967); <em>Cavalier Label Co., Inc. v. S. S. Lilika, </em>71 F.R.D. 395, 397 (S.D.N.Y.1976). On the contrary, Rule 60(b) obligated him to move \u201cwithin a reasonable time.\u201d Upon receiving written notice on March 5,1977, that his client\u2019s action had been dismissed pursuant to Rule 41 and that an order finalizing the dismissal would be filed unless he moved within 10 days, he was duty bound to move to vacate the dismissal. Any possible doubt about this obligation was removed on March 21, 1977, when he was further advised by the Government\u2019s counsel that unless he moved promptly for reinstatement, the Government would oppose its restoration to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>calendar. Yet he did nothing for over 10 more months.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">The cave-in of Santos\u2019 office on May 27, 1977, and storage of his papers elsewhere provides no excuse for his abysmal neglect. From March 5, when he first received notice of the dismissal, until May 27 \u2014 a period of almost three months \u2014 there was more than ample time to file the short and simple Rule 60(b) motion that was required. Thereafter, assuming his files were inaccessible, nothing precluded him from obtaining the original file from the clerk of the Eastern District of New York and preparing the essential motion with supporting affidavit, which probably would not then have been opposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">(2] Under all of the circumstances Judge Platt\u2019s denial of appellant\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion filed on January 26, 1978, did not constitute an abuse of discretion but, on the contrary, was clearly reasonable. Unfortunately, appellant is bound by the inexcusable conduct of her counsel, since there is no particularized showing of exceptional circumstances explaining his gross negligence and no indication of diligent efforts by appellant to induce him to fulfill his duty, compare <em>United States v. Cirami, </em>535 F.2d 736 (2d Cir. 1976), with <em>United States v. Cirami, </em>563 F.2d 26 (2d Cir. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">The order of the district court is affirmed. In view of the inexcusable neglect on the part of appellant\u2019s counsel which gave rise to this appeal, costs will be assessed against her counsel.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b712-11\">. Rule 41(b), F.R.Civ.P., provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b712-16\">\u201c(b) <em>Involuntary Dismissal: Effect Thereof. </em>For failure of the plaintiff, to prosecute or to comply with these rules or any order of court, a defendant may move for dismissal of an action or of any claim against him. . . Unless the court in its order for dismissal otherwise specifies, a dismissal under this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>subdivision and any dismissal not provided in this rule, other than a dismissal for lack of jurisdiction, for improper venue, or for failure to join a party under Rule 19, operates as an adjudication upon the merits.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b713-8\">Rule 8(a) of the Eastern District of New York Local Rules provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-9\"><em>\u201cDismissal or Default. </em>Failure of counsel for any party to appear before the court at a conference, or to complete the necessary preparations, or to be prepared to proceed at the time set, may be considered an abandonment of the case or failure to prosecute or defend diligently, and an appropriate order may be entered against the defaulting party either with respect to a specific issue or on the entire case.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b713-10\">. In his opinion (note 2) Judge Platt points out that in an affidavit supporting his Rule 60(b) motion, Santos incorrectly stated that the law clerk had advised that no pretrial conference was scheduled because no answer had been filed, even though Santos \u201cknew this was not the case, an answer having been filed by defendant the preceding August.\u201d Nevertheless Santos failed to bring this fact to anyone\u2019s attention or communicate with counsel for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-15\">Moreover, Santos gave the Assistant U.S. Attorney in charge of the case, at their March 21, 1977, conference, an entirely different reason for his not attending the February 18, 1978, conference, stating that he had \u201cadvised Fred Townsend [apparently Judge Platt\u2019s law clerk] that he was preparing a motion for summary judgment and [was] excused from attending the status conference on that basis,\u201d Memorandum of Asst. U.S. Attorney E. S. Rudofsky re: Conference with Santos, 3/21/77.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
