In holding that the employer cannot be so held, we sustain the regulation against a <em>facial </em>constitutional challenge, but limit its application to those conditions which the cited employer\u2019s industry would recognize as hazards requiring the use of safety equipment, the absence of which constitutes a violation. The result in this ease is to reverse the Commission\u2019s assessment of a nonserious violation on the ground that there is not substantial evidence in the record to support a finding that a reasonably prudent employer in the insulation industry would have understood that the use of safety belts was mandated by the conditions for which B&amp;B was cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b1462-10\">The employer, B&amp;B Insulation, Inc. (B&amp;B), pursuant to \u00a7 11 of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (Act), 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 651 <em>et seq., </em>petitioned for review of a final order of the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission (Commission). This Court has jurisdiction under 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 660(a). The Commission determined that B&amp;B violated section 5(a)(2) of the Act, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 654(a)(2), by failing to comply with 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1926.28(a), a safety standard promulgated thereunder.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1462-11\">The facts of an accident which led to the citation are undisputed. B&amp;B is an insulation subcontractor which employs approximately 250 employees. On August 9, 1974, B&amp;B was engaged in insulation of steam pipes at a lumber company. The 8-inch steam pipe being insulated was located approximately 23 feet above the ground. Two feet above the steam pipe was a network of steel girders supporting a conveyor belt. Two feet below was a series or \u201crack\u201d of three parallel pipes on which the foreman and one employee stood. The rack consisted of a 16-inch and a 14-inch pipe separated by a 15-inch space through which ran a third pipe of unspecified diameter. The foreman and an employee straddled the center pipe with one foot on each outside pipe and walked down the rack as insulation of the steam pipe progressed. A third employee, who remained on the ground, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1367\">*1367</page-number>tied sections of the insulation to a rope which was pulled up by the employee on the rack. The sections were then carried along the rack and delivered to the foreman who placed them around the steam pipe.</p>\n<p id=\"b1463-5\">The insulation was secured with stainless steel wire until a permanent covering could be installed. The coil of wire remained on the ground with the running end trailing from the foreman\u2019s position on the rack. Nine feet below the rack, mounted on poles, ran the energized and uninsulated power lines of an electric trolley used to transport lumber.</p>\n<p id=\"b1463-6\">On the date in question, the trailing wire came into contact with the power line and electrocuted the foreman. When the other employee on the rack touched the foreman\u2019s body, he received an electrical shock, lost consciousness, and fell backward over the pipes and into a concrete ditch below, fracturing his skull. Neither the foreman nor the employee wore a safety belt.</p>\n<p id=\"b1463-7\">In response to this accident, an Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) compliance officer inspected the worksite on August 13 and 14, 1974. B&amp;B was cited for a nonserious violation<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> because of failure to require its employees to use personal protective equipment, as required by 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1926.28(a).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The citation was grounded on the failure to require the use of safety belts or lifelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b1463-10\">B&amp;B timely contested the citation and the $90 penalty, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 659(c), and the Secretary of Labor filed a formal complaint. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2200.33. The administrative law judge vacated the citation and proposed penalty, finding \u201cno evidence in the record to show that a reasonably prudent person, fully knowledgeable of the insulation installation business would have known that safety belts and lifelines would be necessary equipment within the meaning and intent of section 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1926.-28(a).\u201d On review the Commission reversed the decision by a 2-1 vote, affirming the citation and imposing a $90 penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b1463-11\">B&amp;B argues that 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1926.-28(a) is unenforceably vague for failure to provide employers with reasonable notice of what is required. We share B&amp;B\u2019s concern with the generality of the standard\u2019s command.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We conclude, however, that its requirements are not unforeseeable if the standard is read to require only those protective measures which the knowledge and experience of the employer\u2019s industry, which the employer is presumed to share, would clearly deem appropriate under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b1464-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1368\">*1368</page-number>Because this is remedial civil legislation, rather than criminal, and because no potential deterrence of First Amendment activity is involved, the vagueness charge must be considered in light of the regulation\u2019s application. <em>United States v. National Dairy Products Corp., </em>372 U.S. 29, 36, 83 S.Ct. 594, 9 L.Ed.2d 561 (1963); <em>Ryder Truck Lines, Inc. </em>v. <em>Brennan, </em>497 F.2d 230, 233 (5th Cir. 1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b1464-4\">Due process considerations mandate standards carrying \u201csufficiently definite warning as to the proscribed conduct when measured by common understanding and practices.\u201d <em>United States v. Petrillo, </em>332 U.S. 1, 8, 67 S.Ct. 1538, 1542, 91 L.Ed. 1877 (1947).</p>\n<p id=\"b1464-5\">No Circuit Court of Appeals has yet considered a vagueness challenge to 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1926.28(a) in its present form. The regulation was initially promulgated pursuant to authority granted the Secretary of Labor in \u00a7 107 of the Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act, 40 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 333 (1969). When adopted by the Secretary on May 29, 1971 as an OSHA standard under 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 655(a), this \u201cestablished Federal standard\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> read as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b1464-6\">The employer is responsible for requiring the wearing of appropriate personal protective equipment in all operations where there is an exposure to hazardous conditions <em>and </em>where this part indicates the need for using such equipment to reduce the hazards to the employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1464-11\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1464-12\">As so worded, the standard was held un-enforceably vague by the Ninth Circuit in <em>Hoffman Construction Co. v. OSHRC, </em>546 F.2d 281 (9th Cir. 1976), when applied to the asserted need for safety lines attached to a structure on which employees were working forty feet above the ground. The court acknowledged the danger involved as a matter of \u201cgeneral intuition.\u201d Noting the conjunctive structure of the standard\u2019s command, however, the court found no specific instructions among the subsections of Part 1926 to tell the employer when protective equipment is required. 546 F.2d at 283.</p>\n<p id=\"b1464-13\">The regulation was reworded on December 16,1972 to substitute \u201cor\u201d for the \u201cand\u201d in italics above. 37 Fed.Reg. 27,510 (1972). The <em>Hoffman </em>court expressly declined to comment on the revised versions.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> 546 F.2d at 283 n.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b1464-14\">Although the Commission has consistently upheld the standard as not unenforceably vague, each decision by the Commission has produced as many conflicting interpretations as there were participating commissioners, both under the old regulation,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1369\">*1369</page-number>the new.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This case itself was decided with three different written opinions. This continuing \u201cthree-way split in the interpretation of the standard,\u201d as referred to in the concurring opinion of Commissioner Cleary, might well evidence to some the very vagueness charged by the petitioner. If the regulation is such that the commissioners themselves cannot agree upon what it demands, it may seem to require different things to different employers, the cornerstone of the uncertainty argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b1465-5\">For the objectivity needed to rescue \u00a7 1926.28(a) from unconstitutional uncertainty, however, we look to cases construing analogous OSHA standards and to the tort law concept of the \u201creasonable man.\u201d Several circuits have upheld, despite its lack of-precision, 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1910.132(a), the subject standard\u2019s general industry analogue.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This Court rejected the employer\u2019s vagueness claim in <em>Ryder Truck Lines, Inc. v. Brennan, 497 </em>F.2d 230, 233 (5th Cir. 1974), finding that section drafted \u201cwith as much exactitude as possible in light of the myriad conceivable situations which could arise and which would be capable of causing injury.\u201d The Court identified as inherent in the standard, the test of whether or not a reasonable person would have recognized the hazard. In <em>Ryder </em>the hazard recognized by the \u201creasonable person\u201d to warrant use of protective footwear was that of foot injuries to dock workers in contact with heavy freight and equipment in a confined area.</p>\n<p id=\"b1465-15\">The \u201creasonable person\u201d test was also read into 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1910.132(a) by the Fourth Circuit in <em>McLean Trucking Co. v. OSHRC, </em>503 F.2d 8 (4th Cir. 1974). Again the use of protective footwear for loading dock workers was the safety obligation of which the employer was deemed to have notice. The reasonable person approach, the Court noted, accords with congressional purpose as reflected in the general duty clause of the statute itself,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> xthe language of which is at least as imprecise as that of 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1910.132(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1465-16\">In a third protective footwear case, <em>Arkansas-Best Freight Systems, Inc. v. OSHRC, </em>529 F.2d 649, 655 (8th Cir. 1976), the Eighth Circuit endorsed the \u201creasonable person\u201d interpretation, a test of foreseeability of danger warranting protective equipment, to determine the applicability of the difficult protective equipment standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b1465-17\">In <em>Cape &amp; Vineyard Div. v. OSHRC, </em>512 F.2d 1148 (1st Cir. 1975), \u00a7 1910.132(a) was applied to an alleged failure of the employer to require protective equipment against electrical shock in utility company repair work. The \u201creasonable person\u201d test was embellished to ask \u201cwhether a reasonably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1370\">*1370</page-number>prudent man familiar with the circumstances of the industry would have protected against the hazard.\u201d 512 F.2d at 1152.</p>\n<p id=\"b1466-4\">The <em>Cape &amp; Vineyard </em>test was relied upon by the Ninth Circuit in <em>Brennan v. Smoke-Craft, Inc., </em>530 F.2d 843, 845 (9th Cir. 1976) to determine the need for protective gloves in the sausage manufacturing industry. It was endorsed most recently by the Second Circuit in <em>American Airlines, Inc. v. Secretary of Labor, </em>578 F.2d 38, 41 (2d Cir. 1978), in the context of a requirement for protective footwear for airline cargo handlers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1466-5\">The clarity of the standard <em>sub judice </em>is equally well served by the \u201creasonable person\u201d approach if applied with a sensitivity to the circumstances in which it is used.</p>\n<p id=\"b1466-6\">The \u201creasonable man\u201d is, of course, a fictional character borrowed from tort law wherein his conduct sets the standard below which behavior constitutes negligence. <em>See generally, </em>W. Prosser, Law <em>of Torts </em>at 149-80. Because the reasonable man personifies the community ideal of reasonable behavior, evidence of customary conduct of those similarly situated may be probative in determining his behavior. <em>Id. </em>at 166-68. <em>See, e. g., Ward v. Hobart Manuf. Co., </em>450 F.2d 1176, 1185 (5th Cir. 1971) (where defendant manufacturer conformed with standards prevailing in the industry and no strong evidence countered customary practices, this Court found little to indicate defendant\u2019s conduct was unreasonable). Custom is, however, not dispositive in negligence actions. \u201c[W]hat ought to be done is fixed by a standard of reasonable prudence, whether it usually is complied with or not.\u201d <em>Texas &amp; Pacific Ry. Co. v. Behymer, </em>189 U.S. 468, 470, 23 S.Ct. 622, 623, 47 L.Ed. 905 (1903).</p>\n<p id=\"b1466-7\">The Commission here purported to decide what the reasonable employer in B&amp;B\u2019s industry would have done under the conditions for which B&amp;B was cited. The Commission\u2019s conclusion is inaccurate because it is based entirely upon the opinion of people employed by the Government and depends not at all upon the evidence drawn from the people employed by the industry. This application of the reasonable person rule stands the principle on its head. The common law reasonable man standard was developed and applied in direct reference to persons who would be subject to judgment by that standard. Here, the Commission would decide ad hoc what would be reasonable conduct for persons of particular expertise and experience without reference to the actual conduct which that experience has engendered. In other words, the Commission would assert the authority to decide what a reasonable prudent employer would do under particular circumstances, even .though in an industry of multiple employers, not one of them would have followed that course of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1466-9\">This disregard of demonstrated industry custom is clearly beyond the intention of the cases which first borrowed the reasonable man theory to construe OSHA standards. As the Court said in <em>Ryder, supra:</em></p>\n<p id=\"AFHC\">So long as the mandate affords a reasonable warning of the proscribed conduct in light of common understanding and practices, it will pass constitutional muster.</p>\n<p id=\"A39\">497 F.2d at 233. In <em>Cape &amp; Vineyard, supra </em>at 1152, the court observed that conduct of the reasonably prudent employer would generally be established by reference to industry custom and practice. The <em>Smoke-Craft </em>court, only after failing to find a relevant industry custom with which to compare the employer\u2019s conduct, sought other evidence that a reasonably prudent employer would have protected against the alleged hazard. <em>Smoke-Craft, supra </em>at 845. <em>But see, Allis-Chalmers Corp. v. OSHRC, </em>542 F.2d 27, 30-31 (7th Cir. 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1466-10\">Where the reasonable man is used to interpolate specific duties from general OSHA regulations, the character and purposes of the Act suggest a closer identification between the projected behavior of the reasonable man and the customary practice of employers in the industry. The purpose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1371\">*1371</page-number>of the Act is preventive rather than compensatory.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Achievement of its goal of reducing industrial accidents depends upon employer compliance through elimination of legislatively identified safety and health hazards by prescribed remedial measures. Preventive goals are obviously not advanced where broad standards are extended to encompass every situation which gives rise to an unlikely accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b1467-5\">The Act indicates that Congress thought specificity of standards desirable.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In light of the Acts preventive purpose and the intended specificity of its standards, the employer whose activity is not yet addressed by a specific regulation and whose conduct conforms to the common practice of those similarly situated in his industry should generally not bear an extra burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b1467-13\">Where the Government seeks to encourage a higher standard of safety performance from the industry than customary industry practices exhibit,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> the proper recourse is to the standard-making machinery provided in the Act, selective enforcement of general standards being inappropriate to achieve such a purpose.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The use of standard-making procedures assures that not only would employers be apprised of the conduct required of them and responsibility for upgrading the safety of the industry would be borne equally by all its members, but the resulting standard would benefit from input of the industry\u2019s experts,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1372\">*1372</page-number>employer and employee, cost and technology obstacles faced by the industry could be weighed,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and more interested parties can participate in the process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1468-4\">Viewed in the light of a constitutionally applied regulation, B&amp;B\u2019s challenge of the evidentiary basis for the Commission\u2019s decision must be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b1468-5\">The Commission\u2019s findings are of course conclusive with respect to questions of fact where substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole supports them. 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 660(a). The Secretary has the burden of proving all elements of a violation. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2200.73. In this case that burden included a demonstration that a reasonable insulation industry employer would have used safety belts where B&amp;B did not. Of the eleven witnesses who testified at the hearing, however, only the OSHA compliance officer who issued the citation to B&amp;B believed that safety belts would have been appropriate under the circumstances. The compliance officer had never before issued a citation to employees working on a pipe rack without safety belts and had no statistics or personal knowledge concerning falls from pipe racks. He expressed a position' similar to that espoused by Commissioner Cleary in the Commission decision below that where a full hazard exists it must be protected against regardless of the degree of hazard or probability of a fall.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1468-10\">Although having some simplistic appeal, such an approach to fall hazards would seem to require safety belts for an ordinary set of stairs, because people do fall down stairs from time to time, and are seriously injured. To state such a proposition is sufficient to refute the suggestion that Congress intended its regulations to go so far.</p>\n<p id=\"b1468-11\">The Secretary of Labor introduced no evidence of customary procedures in the industry. B&amp;B, on the contrary, produced a variety of witnesses representing labor and management to demonstrate that the \u201creasonable man\u201d would have done no more than B&amp;B under these circumstances.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1468-12\">In absence of evidence that B&amp;B\u2019s conduct fell below the demonstrated practice in the industry, the Commission\u2019s decision was not supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1468-13\">REVERSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1462-8\">. The purpose of the Act, to assure safe and healthful working conditions, is accomplished in part by authorizing th\u00e9 Secretary of Labor to set mandatory occupational safety and health standards. 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 651(b)(3). The standards, applicable to all businesses affecting interstate commerce, <em>id., </em>impose two types of duties on employers. The employer\u2019s \u201cgeneral duty\u201d is to furnish employment and a place of employment free from \u201crecognized hazards that are causing or are likely to cause death or serious physical harm.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 654(a)(1). The employer must also comply with the specific standards issued pursuant to the Act, which may also articulate general duties. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 654(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1462-13\">29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1926.28(a), a \u00a7 654(a)(2) standard, provides</p>\n<p id=\"b1462-14\">The employer is responsible for requiring the wearing of appropriate personal protective equipment in all operations where there is an exposure to hazardous conditions or where this part indicates the need for using such equipment to reduce the hazards to the employees.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1463-12\">. The Act does not define a \u201cnonserious\u201d violation. The OSHA field operations manual states that nonserious violation citations are to be issued \u201cwhere an accident or occupational illness resulting from violation of a standard would probably not cause death or serious physical harm, but which would have a direct or immediate relationship to safety or health of employees.\u201d <em>Occupational Safety and Health Administration, U. S. Dep\u2019t of Labor, Field Operations Manual </em>VIII-B2 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b1463-13\">The Act itself provides that a \u201cserious violation\u201d exists where \u201cthere is a substantial probability that death or serious physical harm could result . . . unless the employer did not, and could not with the exercise of reasonable diligence, know of the presence of the violation.\u201d 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 666(j).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1463-15\">. B&amp;B was also cited for a serious violation of 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1926.400(c) for permitting employees to work in close proximity to electric power lines which had not been de-energized or effectively insulated. That citation was affirmed by the administrative law judge and further review was not sought.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1463-17\">. Uncertainty as to what a standard requires has an economic impact on employers in the construction industry. Only the employer aware of his responsibility for often costly safety equipment is able to cover its cost in contract bids submitted before construction begins. If a contract bid includes costs which an employer thought required by the standard, but were not, his bid may be noncompetitive with those which did not include such cost, and he may lose the job. <em>See </em>Stokes, <em>Legal Considerations of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, </em>in the <em>Occupational Safety and Health Act </em>75-76 (B.Walls ed. 1972); Sabo, <em>OSHA Problems in the Construction Industry, Proceedings of the American Bar Association National Institute on Occupational Safety and Health Law </em>(1976) 215-217, 222.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1464-7\">. The Act authorizes standards of three types: national consensus standards or established federal standards adopted for OSHA use within two years of the Act\u2019s effective date, 29 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 655(a), permanent standards developed by the Secretary of Labor along with an advisory committee, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 655(b), and emergency temporary standards, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 655(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b1464-8\">An \u201cestablished Federal standard\u201d is any operative occupational safety and health standard established by any federal agency in effect at the enactment of the Act. 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 652(10). \u201cNational consensus\u201d standards are those emanating from a nationally recognized standard producing organization. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 652(9).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1464-9\">. Commissioner Moran maintains that the standard in its present form is invalid because the Secretary failed to comply with rulemaking procedures of 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 655(b) in accomplishing the revision. The amendment, which claimed to make no substantive change, was achieved by mere substitution of \u201cor\u201d for \u201cand\u201d in the Secretary\u2019s December 16, 1972 revision of construction standards.
