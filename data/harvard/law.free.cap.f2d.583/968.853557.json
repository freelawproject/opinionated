We hold that it may not.</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-19\">Defendant Michael B. Laikin is a lawyer who represented the University National Bank in a loan transaction with Roland C. Hansen. Mr. Hansen borrowed $210,000 from the Bank, pledging as collateral a number of properties.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The two parcels of concern here were assigned a combined collateral value of $40,000 which considerably exceeded the assessed value of the parcels.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The two parcels together were insured for a total of $70,000 (Tr. 286). Three weeks after the closing in the above transaction, these two properties were burnt down and the government initiated an investigation into the possibility of arson. It was at this point that a man named Howard Bloom, who had put defendant in touch with Han-sen for the loan transaction, approached defendant with the question of whether he had heard Hansen threaten arson at any point during the closing negotiations. Defendant denied hearing any such threat. Bloom then asked defendant whether he might have heard a joke about the properties. Defendant replied that he could not recall but that he could not rule out the possibility of a joke (Tr. 222).</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-20\">The following month, Bloom called the defendant from the FBI\u2019s office. In the ensuing telephone conversation, which was taped by the government, Bloom told defendant that he had been talking with the FBI and just wanted to let him know what he had told them in case the FBI should question defendant. He said that he had told the FBI about Hansen\u2019s \u201cjoke\u201d concerning the properties \u201cnot be[ing] around too long\u201d and then asked defendant whether he recalled such a joke. Defendant responded that he vaguely recalled something to that effect but that it did not stand out like a red light.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1066-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"970\">*970</page-number>At the grand jury hearing, where defendant is alleged to have committed the perjury, he was asked whether at any time before or during the closing \u201cMr. Hansen indicated to you with respect to at least one or more of his properties there would be no problem from the bank\u2019s standpoint because that property would be liquidated in the future in terms of some sort of a loss or casualty to that property.\u201d Defendant replied that he had \u201cno specific recollection <em>of the statements or the thought </em>you are asking about\u201d and volunteered that he had previously told Bloom over the phone <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> that he really could not remember whether \u201cthat statement\u201d had been made by Hansen.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1066-4\">At a later point in the grand jury hearings, defendant was asked whether he remembered Hansen making a statement such as \u201cdon\u2019t worry about some of this because there may be a fire or there may be some loss to this property and it\u2019s insured and you will get your money right away.\u201d Defendant replied that \u201cthat statement\u201d had not been made in his presence. (Grand Jury Proceedings 35-36.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-25\">Defendant was convicted following a bench trial in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin of knowingly making a false material declaration before a federal grand jury in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1623. We reverse on the ground that the questions asked of defendant on the two occasions were objectively not the same and hence admitted of different answers consistently with the \u201cliteral truth\u201d standard of <em>Bronston v. United States, </em>409 U.S. 352, 93 S.Ct. 595, 34 L.Ed.2d 568 (1973). Defendant may have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"971\">*971</page-number>himself thought that he was being asked the same question on both occasions, but intent to commit perjury does not constitute perjury. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>536 F.2d 1202, 1207 (7th Cir. 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-5\">As can be seen from an examination of the question asked of defendant by Bloom in the taped telephone conversation and the question asked by the Government in the grand jury hearings, the two are not the same. Bloom asked defendant whether he remembered Hansen saying something at the closing about the properties \u201cnot being around too long,\u201d whereas the Government asked defendant whether he remembered a Hansen comment about \u201closs or casualty\u201d or \u201cfire ... or some loss\u201d to property. Defendant\u2019s admission to a vague recollection of the former but to no recollection of the latter is not necessarily inconsistent. If his recollection were only of some Hansen comment about properties \u201cnot being around too long,\u201d he spoke the literal truth when he denied any recollection of a comment about loss, casualty, or fire because the Hansen comment he remembered did not necessarily carry any fire overtones.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-6\">Defendant may in fact have been aware that the Hansen comment contained a veiled reference to arson and he probably realized that the government was trying to find out whether he remembered any comment at all about the properties, including a comment about the properties \u201cnot being around too long.\u201d However, the Government did not ask him that precise question, and defendant was not required to answer the unasked question. \u201cThe burden is on the questioner to pin the witness down to the specific object of the questioner\u2019s inquiry.\u201d <em>Bronston v. United States, </em>409 U.S. 352, 360, 93 S.Ct. 595, 601, 34 L.Ed.2d 568 (1973). What was said in <em>Bronston </em>with respect to the literally true but unresponsive answer holds equally true here:</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-7\">Precise questioning is imperative as a predicate for the offense of perjury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-9\">It may well be that petitioner\u2019s answers were not guileless but were shrewdly calculated to evade. Nevertheless, . . . any special problems arising from the literally true but unresponsive answer are to be remedied through the \u201cquestioner\u2019s acuity\u201d and not by a federal perjury prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-11\"><em>Bronston v. United States, </em>409 U.S. 352, 362, 93 S.Ct. 595, 602, 34 L.Ed.2d 568 (1973). The rationale of the <em>Bronston </em>case was that an unresponsive answer should put the questioner on notice of the need to pin the witness down with more precise questioning. We are confronted here with the case of a literally true and <em>responsive </em>answer. While in such a case the questioner does not have the warning flag of an unresponsive answer to put him on guard, the Government here should have realized that it was not asking defendant the same question as that put to him by Bloom in the telephone conversation, and hence was on notice that defendant\u2019s different answer could be literally true. The Government should not at this stage be able to. argue around a mistake which it could have easily avoided at the time of questioning by following elementary witness-examining technique.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-12\">Because we are able to resolve the case on the basis of the questions asked of defendant on the two relevant occasions, we find it unnecessary to address defendant\u2019s other arguments relating to the ambiguity of his answers and the immateriality of his recollection of the telephone conversation to the grand jury investigation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1067-13\">For the reasons stated, the judgment appealed from is REVERSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1065-15\">. This transaction is described by the parties as a \u201cwork-out\u201d transaction entered into by the Bank to rid its books of $92,000 in bad checks which the Bank considered uncollectible. Mr. Hansen agreed to purchase the bad checks at face value, so he received only $118,000 of the loan in cash, the balance being in the form of the bad checks.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1065-21\">. One parcel was assessed at between $10,000 and $13,000 and the other at between $15,000 and $17,000, so at most the assessed value of the two properties together could not have exceeded $30,000 (Tr. 277).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1065-22\">. The transcript of the taped telephone conversation is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-23\">Bloom: I was down ah, with the FBI just a little while ago.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"970\">*970</page-number>Laikin: oh, okay.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-6\">Bloom: Okay, just so you know what I told the, so, ya know, you don\u2019t think I\u2019m, so when they ask you a question, you know what it\u2019s all about, so you don\u2019t think I\u2019m gonna play a game with ya.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-7\">Laikin: No, all right.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-8\">Bloom: But did you remember they asked me about those two fires on ah Twenty-eighth Street?

(Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1066-21\">. Defendant testified at trial that he had confused the telephone conversation with the face-to-face conversation with Bloom (Tr. 257).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1066-22\">. A transcript of the relevant portion of the grand jury questioning follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-23\">Q. Now at one of the \u2014 either at the closing or probably more likely at one of the negotiating sessions prior to the completion of the loan, was there a time when in Mr. Bloom and Mr. Hansen\u2019s presence, <em>Mr. Han-sen indicated to you that with respect to at least one or more of his properties there would be no problem from the bank\u2019s standpoint because that property would be liquidated in the future in terms of some sort of a ioss or casualty to that property </em>?</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-27\">A. No, I have \u2014 I was asked <em>that question </em>by Mr. Walsh when he was in my office about a month ago, something like that. And I really racked my mind and I have no specific recollection <em>of the statements or the thought that you are asking about. </em>Some weeks prior to when I met with Mr. Walsh I was asked whether I had heard that, and \u2014 by Mr. Bloom, he had called me. And I said I really can\u2019t remember.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-28\">It could have been said, you know. I can\u2019t say yes and I can\u2019t say no. It was a busy time. It was on a Friday, late in the afternoon through the evening when most of the work started on the paper work, and the people were in our office. And we were going back and forth among several rooms. But no, I can\u2019t \u2014 I can\u2019t specifically say that I heard it or I didn\u2019t \u2014 or didn\u2019t hear it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-29\">Q. You mentioned that Mr. Bloom made a call to you prior to Mr. Walsh\u2019s seeing you.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-30\">A. That is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-31\">Q. And inquired as to the same thing that Mr. Walsh inquired as to.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-32\">A. He asked in substance whether I heard <em>that statement </em>made in my office, and I said I really don\u2019t know. It could have been. It could not have been. I truly don\u2019t know. It doesn\u2019t stand out, if that\u2019s what you are \u2014 .</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-33\">Appendix, Item 1, pp. 2-3. (Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1067-8\">. Defendant also argued that it was improper for the government to question him before the grand jury about the telephone conversation without notifying him of the existence of a tape recording of that conversation. This issue was addressed in a recent per <em>curiam </em>opinion by this Court. <em>United States v. Edelson, </em>581 F.2d 1290 at 1292 (7th Cir. 1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
