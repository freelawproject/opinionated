Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 247b(k),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the District Court permitted the United States to substitute itself as a defendant in the lawsuit. The court granted the government\u2019s motion to dismiss Jones\u2019s action based upon his failure to exhaust administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b1166-24\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 247b(k)(2)(A) provides that claims arising under the Swine Flu Act are governed by the procedures of the Federal Tort Claims Act. Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2675(b) of the Tort Claims Act, a claimant must present his claim to the appropriate administrative agency before filing an action in the district court. The District Court found that Jones, admittedly, had not exhausted his administrative remedies. Thus, the court granted the government\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b1166-25\">The District Court rejected Jones\u2019s contentions that: (1) the Swine Flu Act does not apply to negligence claims, and (2) the Act is unconstitutional. After a review of the briefs and the District Court\u2019s opinion, we are satisfied that the court\u2019s findings of fact are not clearly erroneous and that no error of law appears. We, thus, affirm on the basis of the District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1071\">*1071</page-number>Court\u2019s opinion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See Ivo Jones v.
