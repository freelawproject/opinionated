This development has focussed heightened attention on the requirement that the government should act, with respect to individuals whose interests are affected by its conduct, in a non-arbitrary, procedurally fair manner, according to the dictates of due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-13\">In this case, we are called upon to analyze the contours of the right to due process of one who has been discharged from public employment. Specifically, Leroy McKnight contends that he was denied such constitutional right when \u2014 in the absence of a hearing or an opportunity to be heard \u2014 he was terminated from employment with the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA), on the grounds that he had been intoxicated and had not fulfilled his work-related responsibilities. The district court granted defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss McKnight\u2019s complaint. For the reasons set forth herein, we vacate the judgment of the district court and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-15\">The complaint alleges that McKnight was employed from September 17, 1970, until November 22,1975, as a special investigator in SEPTA\u2019s security force. SEPTA is an instrumentality of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania operating under the Metropolitan Authorities Act of 1963, [66 P.S.A. \u00a7 2001 <em>et seq. </em>(Purdon\u2019s Supp.1978)] (the Act), for the purpose of providing public transportation to the residents of the greater Philadelphia area. SEPTA\u2019s security force was not represented by a union, and its relationship with the employer was not governed by a collective bargaining agreement. However, \u00a7 25(a) of the Act [66 P.S.A. \u00a7 2025(a)] provides that no employee of an agency such as SEPTA may be discharged except for \u201cjust cause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-16\">On November 22,1975, SEPTA\u2019s Director of Security discharged McKnight \u201con the alleged grounds that he (McKnight) had been intoxicated while at work and that he had failed to perform his designated duties.\u201d McKnight denied the validity of the allegations. He also offered to undergo a test for sobriety, but his employers refused the offer. The employers did not allow McKnight to discuss the discharge with his immediate supervisor. Furthermore, McKnight was not given a written statement of the reasons for his discharge, and was provided with no opportunity to contest the charges that led to his dismissal. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1232\">*1232</page-number><em>McKnight </em>v. <em>SEPTA, </em>438 F.Supp. 813, 815 (E.D.Pa.1977).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1328-4\">McKnight brought the present action on September 30, 1976, against SEPTA, eleven individuals who comprise SEPTA\u2019s Transportation Board and other officials of SEPTA, including its General Manager and Chief Executive Officer, Director of Industrial Relations and Director of Security. Jurisdiction of the federal court was asserted under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343(3), and under the grant of general federal question jurisdiction conferred by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331.</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-5\">Defendants are charged in the complaint with denying the rights of McKnight to procedural and substantive due process. The complaint also asserts pendent state claims against the defendants for violating \u00a7 25 of the Act, <em>supra, </em>and for breaching McKnight\u2019s employment contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-6\">As a result of his discharge, the complaint declares, McKnight suffered a deprivation of \u201cincome, economic hardship and emotional distress,\u201d as well as a loss of accumulated vacation pay and retirement benefits. Also, it is said that he sustained a \u201closs of reputation in the community and the loss of opportunity for other employment.\u201d For relief, McKnight seeks compensatory damages and costs; a judgment pursuant to the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2201-2202, stating that SEPTA\u2019s practices are unconstitutional; and an order compelling a hearing, reinstating him to his former position, and granting him accumulated backpay, vacation and retirement benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-7\">Defendants moved jointly to dismiss the action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. <em>See </em>Fed.R. Civ.P. 12(b)(1) and (6).</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-11\">In a carefully crafted opinion filed on October 4, 1977, the district court held that SEPTA was excluded from liability under the Civil Rights Act of 1871 because that Act imposes liability only upon \u201cpersons,\u201d and \u201cit is now firmly established that a state governmental entity such as SEPTA is not a \u2018person\u2019 within the meaning of the Act.\u201d <em>McKnight v. SEPTA, </em>438 F.Supp. at 816. Inasmuch as SEPTA is excluded from the reach of the Act, the district court reasoned, jurisdiction over the claims lodged against SEPTA could not be predicated on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343(3), for the latter statute is operative only as the jurisdictional vehicle for claims satisfying the Act\u2019s requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-12\">With respect to McKnight\u2019s argument that the district court has federal question jurisdiction over the action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331, the trial court concluded that such jurisdiction extends only to the prayers for declaratory and injunctive relief against SEPTA. The claim for damages, it ascertained, was barred by the principle that \u201can action for damages against a state governmental entity may not be asserted directly under the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d 438 F.Supp. at 816; <em>see also Jones v. McElroy, </em>429 F.Supp. 848, 853-60 (E.D.Pa.1977).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1328-13\">Upon reaching the merits, the district court determined that the question whether McKnight had been deprived without due process of a \u201cproperty\u201d interest \u2014 which depends on there being an independently-created property right of which McKnight had been stripped \u2014 was \u201csufficiently unclear [so as] to warrant abstention.\u201d In declining to deal with the question of McKnight\u2019s property-based claim to due process, the district court left its resolution to the state courts.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1329-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1233\">*1233</page-number>The district court then discussed McKnight\u2019s contention that he had suffered grave detriment to his reputation and his future employment prospects \u2014 and thus to a protected \u201cliberty\u201d interest \u2014 as a consequence of his discharge on the grounds of intoxication. The court ruled that defendant\u2019s accusation regarding McKnight\u2019s intoxication was \u201cnot sufficiently stigmatizing\u201d of him to rise to the level of an abridgement of his \u201cliberty\u201d interest, and thus could not act to trigger due process safeguards.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1329-4\">After thus disposing of the constitutional issues, the district court exercised its discretion and dismissed the pendent state law claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-7\">We turn first to the district court\u2019s analysis of the scope of federal jurisdiction over the present action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-8\">In concluding that an action under \u00a7 1983 may not be maintained against SEPTA, for \u201ca state governmental entity such as SEPTA is not a \u2018person\u2019 within the meaning of the (Civil Rights) Act,\u201d the district court relied on a line of Supreme Court cases reaching back to <em>Monroe v. Pape, </em>365 U.S. 167, 187-92, 81 S.Ct. 473, 5 L.Ed.2d 492 (1961). <em>See also City of Kenosha v. Bruno, </em>412 U.S. 507, 511-13, 93 S.Ct. 2222, 37 L.Ed.2d 109 (1973); <em>Moor </em>v. <em>County of Alameda, </em>411 U.S. 693, 706-10, 93 S.Ct. 1785, 36 L.Ed.2d 596 (1973). The theory of <em>Monroe, </em>with respect to the point in question, is that Congress did not intend to bring municipal corporations within the ambit of the Act. <em>See </em>365 U.S. at 187-92, 81 S.Ct. 473.</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-13\">However, the Supreme Court recently reanalyzed the relevant legislative history and came to the opposite conclusion regarding the liability of local governments. It specifically overruled <em>Monroe v. Pape </em>\u201cinsofar as it holds that local governments are wholly immune from suit under \u00a7 1983.\u201d <em>Monnell </em>v. <em>Department of Social Services of the City of New York, </em>436 U.S. 658, 659, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 2019, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-14\"><em>Monnell </em>set forth the following interpretation of the reach of \u00a7 1983:</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-15\">Our analysis of the legislative history of the Civil Rights Act of 1871 compels the conclusion that Congress <em>did </em>intend municipalities and other local government units to be included among those persons to whom \u00a7 1983 applies. Local governing bodies, therefore, can be sued directly under \u00a7 1983 for monetary, declaratory, or injunctive relief where, as here, the action that is alleged to be unconstitutional implements or executes a policy statement, ordinance, regulation, or decision officially adopted and promulgated by that body\u2019s officers. Moreover, although the touchstone of the \u00a7 1983 action against a government body is an allegation that official policy is responsible for a deprivation of rights protected by the Constitution, local governments, like every other \u00a7 1983 \u2018person,\u2019 by the very terms of the statute, may be sued for constitutional deprivations visited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1234\">*1234</page-number>pursuant to governmental \u2018custom\u2019 even though such a custom has not received formal approval through the body\u2019s official decisionmaking channels.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (emphasis in original)</p>\n<p id=\"b1330-4\">Thus, to the extent that the district court relied on the Supreme Court\u2019s articulation of the law prior to <em>Monnell, </em>its analysis may no longer be sustained. We must accordingly mandate further consideration, in light of <em>Monnell, </em>of MeKnight\u2019s claim for damages under \u00a7 1983.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1330-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1330-6\">The history of the phrase \u201cdue process of the law\u201d extends at least from the time of Magna Carta, for in the century following the promulgation of that document in 1215, those words became the official English translation \u2014 conveyed in reissues of the charter \u2014 of the original <em>per legem terrae, </em>\u201cby the law of the land.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Reference to due process came to be viewed as a basic protection against arbitrariness in government.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1330-7\">Similarly, in modern American constitutional law, the guarantee of due process has been seen to represent \u201c . . .a profound attitude of fairness between . the individual and government . . . \u201d <em>Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee v. McGrath, </em>341 U.S. 123, 162, 71 S.Ct. 624, 643, 95 L.Ed. 817 (1951) (Frankfurter, J., concurring).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> As such, due process is not susceptible to easy or exact definition. Indeed, as Justice Frankfurter put it, \u201c[ejxpressing as it does in its ultimate analysis respect enforced by law for that feeling of just treatment which has been evolved through centuries of Anglo-American constitutional history and civilization, \u2018due process\u2019 cannot be imprisoned within the treacherous limits of any formula . Due process is not a mechanical instrument. . It is a delicate process of adjustment inescapably involving the exercise of judgment by those whom the Constitution entrusted with the unfolding of the process.\u201d <em>Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee v. McGrath, </em>341 U.S. at 162-63, 71 S.Ct. at 644.</p>\n<p id=\"b1330-17\">Perhaps because of its very capaciousness, the notion of due process has been expressed in a number of different doctrinal formulations.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Since <em>Board of Regents v. Roth, </em>408 U.S. 564, 569-72, 92 S.Ct. 2701, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1235\">*1235</page-number>33 L.Ed.2d 548 (1972), the requirement of due process has been said to arise so long as an individual has suffered a deprivation of protected \u201cliberty\u201d or \u201cproperty\u201d interests, which themselves have been deemed to depend on the existence of an independently-grounded right. <em>Cf. Bishop v. Wood, </em>426 U.S. 341, 344, 96 S.Ct. 2074, 48 L.Ed.2d 684 (1976); <em>Goss v. Lopez, </em>419 U.S. 565, 572-73, 95 S.Ct. 729, 42 L.Ed.2d 725 (1975); <em>Perry v. Sindermann, </em>408 U.S. 593, 599, 92 S.Ct. 2694, 33 L.Ed.2d 570 (1972). Accordingly, we shall focus our inquiry on whether McKnight has set forth allegations in his complaint of a deprivation of a protected \u201cliberty\u201d or \u201cproperty\u201d interest that are sufficient to survive defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b1331-4\">I. <em>The </em>\u201cLiberty\" <em>Interest</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1331-5\">The scope of protected \u201cliberty\u201d as a component of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment is \u201c(i)n a Constitution for a free people . . . broad indeed.\u201d <em>Roth, </em>408 U.S. at 572, 92 S.Ct. at 2707. The Supreme Court in <em>Roth, id. </em>quoted with approval the language of <em>Meyer v. Nebraska, </em>262 U.S. 390, 399, 43 S.Ct. 625, 626, 67 L.Ed. 1042 (1923), which underscored the breadth of the protection of \u201cliberty\u201d:</p>\n<p id=\"b1331-7\">While this [C]ourt has not attempted to define with exactness the liberty . guaranteed (by the Fourteenth Amendment), the term has received much consideration and some of the included things have been definitely stated. Without doubt, it denotes not merely freedom from bodily restraint but also the right of the individual to contract, to engage in any of the common occupations of life, to acquire useful knowledge, to marry, establish a home and bring up children, to worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience, and generally to enjoy those privileges long recognized . as essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness by free men.</p>\n<p id=\"b1331-10\">Any such enumeration of the interests conceived to be within the ambit of the \u201cliberty\u201d interest by its very nature is not exhaustive. Indeed, <em>Roth </em>stressed that, in addition to those interests named in <em>Meyer, </em>courts must safeguard individuals against harm to their \u201c \u2018good name, reputation, honor, or integrity . . . \u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>408 U.S. at 573, 92 S.Ct. at 2707. For \u201c(w)here a person\u2019s good name, reputation, honor, or integrity is at stake because of what the government is doing to him, notice and an opportunity to be heard are essential.\u201d <em>Wisconsin v. Constantineau, </em>400 U.S. 433, 437, 91 S.Ct. 507, 510, 27 L.Ed.2d 515 (1971).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The \u201cliberty\u201d interest arising from a person\u2019s stake in his reputation is what McKnight argues has been infringed here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1331-12\">McKnight\u2019s complaint avers that defendants accused him of being intoxicated at work,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and that \u201c(a)s a result of defendants\u2019 communication to others of SEPTA\u2019s discharge of plaintiff and other unsubstantiated charges against plaintiff, he has suffered loss of reputation in the community and the loss of opportunity for other employment.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Such allegations must be taken as true for the purpose of determining whether it is proper to grant a motion to dismiss, <em>see Gardner v. Toilet Goods Ass\u2019n, </em>387 U.S. 167, 172, 87 S.Ct. 1526, 18 L.Ed.2d 704 (1967), and they must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1236\">*1236</page-number>be construed in the light most favorable to McKnight, <em>see, e. g., Helstoski v. Goldstein, </em>552 F.2d 564, 565 (3d Cir. 1977). The complaint may not be dismissed unless \u201cit appears beyond doubt\u201d that McKnight can establish \u201cno set of facts in support of his claim\u201d that would give rise to an entitlement for relief. <em>Conley v. Gibson, </em>355 U.S. 41, 45-46, 78 S.Ct. 99, 102, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b1332-4\">In holding that the allegations in the complaint were not sufficient to withstand a motion to dismiss, the district court did not rest its conclusion on inadequate or unclear pleading. Indeed, it specifically granted that any such deficiency \u201ccould be cured by amendment.\u201d (438 F.Supp. at 824.) Rather, the district court declared that the \u201cfatal flaw\u201d in McKnight\u2019s position regarding his putative \u201cliberty\u201d interest is that \u201cthe accusation about which he complains is not sufficiently stigmatizing.\u201d <em>Id. As </em>the trial court wrote:</p>\n<p id=\"b1332-5\">(T)he charge that plaintiff \u201chad been intoxicated while at work\u201d referred to an isolated incident and therefore . is not of a stigmatizing character. A charge of intoxication does not reflect \u201cdishonesty,\u201d or \u201cimmorality\u201d or any similar \u201cserious character defects\u201d . Intoxication is not illegal. As defendants point out, there was no general charge of alcoholism, such as would seriously reflect on an individual\u2019s ability to perform adequately in an employment situation. At most, an isolated incident of intoxication reflects intemperance and unsatisfactory job performance . . . <em>.</em><footnotemark><em>14</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1332-6\">On appeal, McKnight maintains, first, that the assertion by the district court that the charge of his intoxication is not so stigmatizing as to amount to a deprivation of \u201cliberty\u201d constitutes a premature finding of fact entered before the evidence has been presented and thus, at this stage, is wholly insupportable. Second, McKnight urges that other requirements for stating a claim for relief from injury to one\u2019s \u201cliberty\u201d interest have been met in this case. Third, McKnight insists that his argument based on his \u201cliberty\u201d interest is buttressed by the fact that the Pennsylvania Constitution includes clauses specifically protecting a citizen\u2019s reputation. Such clauses, says the plaintiff, bring this case squarely within the class of situations involving an explicit, state-protected \u201cliberty\u201d interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1332-11\">We find persuasive McKnight\u2019s contention that the issue whether defendants\u2019 charge of intoxication is sufficiently stigmatizing to constitute an infringement of \u201cliberty\u201d is significantly a question of fact that cannot be appropriately determined at this juncture.</p>\n<p id=\"b1332-12\">One basic element of the \u201cliberty\u201d interest recognized by the Supreme Court is the protection against interference in the absence of due process with an individual\u2019s \u201c . . . later opportunities for . employment\u201d. <em>Goss v. Lopez, </em>419 U.S. 565, 575, 95 S.Ct. 729, 42 L.Ed.2d 725 (1975). In the complaint here, the \u201closs of opportunity for other employment\u201d is specifically cited as a detriment flowing from the defendants\u2019 action. Thus, the question arises whether the defendants\u2019 charge of McKnight\u2019s intoxication in fact has been so stigmatizing as to hinder McKnight in seeking other opportunities of employment. Simply by reading the complaint, it cannot be said with certainty whether such effects did or did not flow from defendants\u2019 conduct. Because a motion to dismiss should not be granted unless it appears \u201cbeyond doubt\u201d that there are no facts that would entitle plaintiff to relief,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and since allegations of substantial stigma are clearly set forth in the complaint, it would appear incorrect to assume \u2014 in the absence of any evidence \u2014 that sufficient stigma cannot be shown.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1333-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1237\">*1237</page-number>In response, defendants submit that allegations of harm to reputation resulting from discharge from public employment should be divided into two broad categories: those that involve charges pertaining to the employee\u2019s performance on the job itself, and those that ascribe to the employee some broad \u201cstatus\u201d beyond that necessarily entailed in the job. The idea underlying this suggestion is that only statements of the second sort rise to the level of a deprivation of a person\u2019s \u201cliberty.\u201d Because the charges against McKnight fall into the first classification, defendants urge, they cannot be said to be so stigmatizing as to abridge McKnight\u2019s \u201cliberty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1333-4\">Looked at critically, defendants\u2019 argument depends on the possibility of drawing a bright-line distinction between charges about an employee that impute to him inappropriate or wrongful behavior in a discrete context on the job, and statements about an employee that impute to him a general social status that is opprobrious and that transcends a given job. Yet such a would-be distinction is slippery at best.</p>\n<p id=\"b1333-5\">Of course, defendants concede \u2014 and we agree \u2014 that if an employer discharges an employee for being an \u201calcoholic\u201d or a \u201cthief,\u201d that employer may be said, because of the ordinary meaning of the words \u201calcoholic\u201d and \u201cthief,\u201d to have attributed to the employee a \u201cstatus\u201d of a general nature. Yet a problem arises when the employer\u2019s statement is not of the sort that ascribes a status to an employee, but rather is the type \u2014 present here \u2014 that accuses the employee of a particularized act, such as that of intoxication. Such a charge does not facially attribute an opprobrious status to an employee. However, that does not rule out the possibility that, for at least some people, a charge of \u201cintoxication\u201d would amount to an accusation that the employee is \u201ca drinker.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1333-6\">To put the point in another context, an employer might discharge an employee for stealing pencils. Many people might say that the action that was the ground for discharge was discrete and confined to a certain job. However, other people could plausibly argue that the accusation really cited the employee for being \u201ca thief\u201d of pencils \u2014 or in other words, that it charged the employee with a status transcending the employee\u2019s particular job. Indeed, it is hardly difficult to imagine that prospective employers would see very little practical difference between an assertion by an applicant\u2019s previous employer that he had stolen pencils, and a flat denunciation of him as a pencil thief. Such analysis indicates that the defendants\u2019 suggestion to base the legal determination of whether an employee\u2019s \u201cliberty\u201d interest in reputation has been infringed on such an elusive distinction as that between \u201cparticular charges\u201d and \u201cstatus charges\u201d is unacceptable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1333-8\">The alternative to the defendants\u2019 suggestion of categorizing different situations is, inevitably, to focus on the particular facts of a specific case- in ascertaining whether the cited harm to reputation and employment prospects has actually resulted from the employer\u2019s charge. Such concentration on the facts of the case at hand is reflected clearly in Supreme Court decisions dealing with claims of a deprivation of \u201cliberty\u201d flowing from discharge from employment. Thus, in <em>Board of Regents v. Roth, </em>the Court \u2014 in reviewing a grant of summary judgment \u2014 wrote:</p>\n<p id=\"b1333-9\">The State, in declining to rehire the respondent, did not make any charge against him that might seriously damage his standing and associations in his community. It did not base the nonrenewal of his contract on a charge, for example, that he had been guilty of dishonesty, or immorality. Had it done so, this would be a different case. . . . <footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1333-10\">Hence, on the record before us, all that clearly appears is that the respondent was not rehired for one year at one university. It stretches the concept too far to suggest that a person is deprived of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1238\">*1238</page-number>\u2018liberty\u2019 when he simply is not rehired in one job but remains as free as before to seek another.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1334-4\">Similarly, the Court in <em>Bishop v. Wood, supra </em>\u2014 once more reviewing a grant of summary judgment \u2014 again closely analyzed the particular facts in determining whether an employee was sufficiently stigmatized as a result of his dismissal to give substance to his claim of a deprivation of \u201cliberty\u201d. The Court stressed that the asserted reasons for the employer\u2019s decision \u201cwere communicated orally to the petitioner in private\u201d and that the \u201ccommunication was not made public.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Therefore, on the basis of the specific facts of the case, <em>Bishop </em>concluded that the plaintiff\u2019s \u201cliberty\u201d interest had not been abridged.</p>\n<p id=\"b1334-5\">In short, defendants have simply not provided an adequate answer to the question implicitly posed by McKnight of how a court is to know whether an employee has been so stigmatized by the employer\u2019s accusations against him as to have been precluded from other employment opportunities unless the court is exposed to pertinent evidence. Such evidence could relate, for instance, to the employee\u2019s applications for employment; the results of any such applications; the reasons given, if any, for his lack of success in securing other employment; and the practices among employers toward hiring security guards who have been discharged for intoxication. But defendants rely primarily on the district court\u2019s language to the effect that the charge of intoxication cannot be considered stigmatizing in modern society. The point still remains that McKnight has alleged that <em>in his case </em>\u2014 not in society generally\u2014 the charges against him foreclosed him from future employment opportunities by harming his reputation. It would appear unresponsive to assert a <em>priori </em>\u2014 even assuming that the assertion is correct \u2014 that overall such a result does not obtain.</p>\n<p id=\"b1334-12\">Consequently, we determine that it was incorrect to say in the absence of clear evidence that McKnight has not set forth adequate allegations of harm to his reputation constituting a deprivation of \u201cliberty.\u201d <footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1334-13\">This conclusion does not end discussion of McKnight\u2019s \u201cliberty\u201d interest, however, for defendants suggest that there are reasons other than the one cited by the district court for affirming the grant of their motion to dismiss. Thus, defendants declare that McKnight has run afoul of the principle of <em>Codd v. Velger, </em>429 U.S. 624, 627-28, 97 S.Ct. 882, 51 L.Ed.2d 92 (1977), that the individual claiming he has been denied due process should have actually challenged the charge made about him by the party said to have infringed his rights.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Defendants assert, in particular, that the paragraph of the complaint stating that the \u201callegations made by SEPTA officials were untrue\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> does not constitute such a direct challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1334-14\">We do not agree. The complaint makes it clear that McKnight denied the charge of intoxication, as well as any other accusations that were made about him. But even granting <em>arguendo </em>that there is ambiguity in the wording of the complaint, we cannot say that the pleading transgresses the admonition in <em>Codd, </em>for there the Supreme Court wrote that \u201c(n)owhere in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1239\">*1239</page-number>his pleading <em>or elsewhere </em>has respondent affirmatively asserted that the report (about him) . . . was substantially false\u201d (emphasis added). 429 U.S. at 627, 97 S.Ct. at 884. In contrast, McKnight has not failed totally to deny the charges about him.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1335-5\">Defendants contend further that the complaint does not adequately assert that there has been public disclosure of the charges relating to McKnight. They concede that the complaint set forth that there was \u201ccommunication to others\u201d of the discharge. But defendants characterize that averment as insufficient on the grounds that it does not explicitly allege \u201cpublic disclosure,\u201d and it does not set forth the nature of the facts disclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1335-6\">In our view, although there may be some ambiguity in the pleadings, that alone is not an adequate basis for a dismissal, especially since, as the trial court pointed out, any such deficiencies could have been corrected by amendment. Also, the complaint asserts that there was \u201ccommunication to others\u201d of the discharge, and it avows that this led to \u201closs of reputation in the community and the loss of opportunity for other employment.\u201d That is enough to preserve the issue, at least at this stage of the proceedings.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1335-9\"><em>Paul v. Davis </em>expressed a concern that we not unduly unsettle the relationship between the national and state governments by overly broadening the scope of federally protected \u201cliberty\u201d interest.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> That consideration would not appear to be present here. Article I \u00a7 1 of the Pennsylvania Constitution, which deals with the \u201cinherent rights of mankind,\u201d provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b1335-10\">All men are born equally free and independent, and have <em>certain inherent and indefeasible rights, among which are those of </em>enjoying and defending life and liberty, of acquiring, possessing and <em>protecting </em>property and <em>reputation, </em>and of pursuing their own happiness.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> (emphasis added)</p>\n<p id=\"b1335-11\">Since the state has already asserted its policy of protecting the right of reputation, the federally-based cause of action would be consistent, rather than contrary to, the state approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b1335-12\">In sum, we hold that the order granting defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss insofar as the argument regarding the \u201cliberty\u201d interest is concerned should be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1335-13\">2. <em>The \u201cProperty\u201d Interest</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1335-14\">As the Supreme Court has written with regard to \u201cproperty\u201d interests in general, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1240\">*1240</page-number>have such an interest one must have \u201cmore than a unilateral expectation\u201d or \u201can abstract need or desire\u201d for it. Rather, one must have \u201ca legitimate claim of entitlement to it.\u201d Such claims are \u201ccreated and their dimensions are defined by existing rules or understandings that stem from an independent source <em>such as state law </em>\u2014rules or understandings that secure certain benefits and that support claims of entitlement to those benefits.\u201d <em>Board of Regents </em>v. <em>Roth, </em>408 U.S. at 577, 92 S.Ct. at 2709 (emphasis added); <em>see also Bishop </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>426 U.S. at 344 &amp; n. 7, 96 S.Ct. at 2709.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1336-4\">The particular state statute that McKnight cites as the foundation of the \u201cproperty\u201d interest at stake in the present case is \u00a7 25(a) of the Act, 66 P.S.A. \u00a7 2025(a) (Purdon\u2019s Supp.1978). Section 25 deals, <em>inter alia, </em>with the classification of employees and their discharge, and subsection (a) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b1336-5\">The board shall classify all the offices, positions and grades of regular employment required, excepting that of the chairman of the board, . . . with reference to the duties thereof and the compensation fixed therefor and adopt rules governing appointments to any of such offices or positions on the basis of merit and efficiency. No discrimination shall be made in any appointment or promotion because of race, creed, color or political or religious affiliations. <em>No officer or employee shall be discharged or demoted except for just cause, </em>(emphasis added)</p>\n<p id=\"b1336-11\">McKnight\u2019s position is that the \u201cjust cause\u201d provision in the statute creates a protected \u201cproperty\u201d interest, for in mandating that an employee like McKnight shall not be discharged unless such action is supported by \u201cjust cause,\u201d the provision conditions the ability of the government to terminate his employment. The district court declined to reach this issue, holding instead that the meaning of the statute was sufficiently unclear so that abstention was warranted in order to give the state courts an opportunity to address the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1336-12\">Among the limited situations in which the Supreme Court has recognized abstention to be proper are those instances where a federal constitutional claim is premised on an unsettled question of state law whose determination by the state court might avoid or modify the constitutional issue. <em>Railroad Commission of Texas v. Pullman Co., </em>312 U.S. 496, 61 S.Ct. 643, 85 L.Ed. 971 (1941).<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Abstention under such circumstances generally serves the dual purposes of averting unnecessary adjudication of constitutional issues and precluding needless interference with legitimate and sensitive state programs.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1337-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1241\">*1241</page-number>Abstention, however, inevitably gives rise to a number of adverse consequences. Relegating the parties to the state courts often results in undue delay in the resolution of the controversy and greatly increases the costs of litigation, factors that heighten the danger that valuable federal rights might be lost.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Not surprisingly, the Supreme Court has consistently instructed that abstention</p>\n<p id=\"b1337-4\">. is an extraordinary and narrow exception to the duty of a District Court to adjudicate a controversy properly before it. Abdication of the obligation to decide cases can be justified under this doctrine only in the exceptional circumstances where the order to the parties to repair to the State court would clearly serve an important countervailing interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1337-5\"><em>County of Allegheny v. Frank Mashuda Co., </em>360 U.S. 185, 188-189, 79 S.Ct. 1060, 1063, 3 L.Ed.2d 1163 (1959), <em>quoted in Colorado River Water Conservation District v. United States, </em>424 U.S. 800, 813, 96 S.Ct. 1236, 47 L.Ed.2d 483 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1337-6\">Mindful of the Supreme Court\u2019s admonition that a federal court should abstain only when \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> exist, we are not convinced that the federal courts must abstain from deciding McKnight\u2019s \u201cproperty\u201d claim. We assume without deciding that \u00a7 25(a) of the Act and the relevant case law precedents are sufficiently unclear to justify resort to the <em>Pullman </em>doctrine,<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> and note that a clarifying pronouncement by the state courts to the effect that \u00a7 25(a) does not create a property interest would obviate a constitutional adjudication. Nonetheless, it appears that abstention in this case would not \u201cclearly serve an important countervailing interest.\u201d <footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1337-11\">On the one hand, if the district court\u2014 upon being confronted with the issue\u2014 would conclude that \u00a7 25(a) does not establish a property right, it would not have to decide the federal constitutional issue and would not interfere at all with the state\u2019s settled practice for dismissing employees. In that event, then, neither of the purposes that generally warrant abstention would be furthered.</p>\n<p id=\"b1337-12\">If on the other hand, the lower court\u2014 were it directed to decide McKnight\u2019s claim \u2014 would conclude that indeed the statute conferred a property right upon McKnight, it would have to reach the constitutional issue. But the question whether summary dismissal of an employee who has a property interest in not being dismissed \u201cexcept for just cause\u201d violates due process would not appear to be a difficult or novel one. Rather, it involves the application of settled principles to a clear fact pattern. Furthermore, such a determination would not upset sensitive state programs. The state would still be free to dismiss its employees; it would only have to afford them notice and an opportunity to be heard to the limited extent mandated by due process.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Should it find even these procedures to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1242\">*1242</page-number>too burdensome, the state through its legislature or courts would be free to amend or construe the statute and make explicit its intent that the employees not be invested with a property right. Since the court would be applying an established constitutional principle and would not be jeopardizing the implementation of state policies or restricting state prerogatives, abstention from a determination that \u00a7 25(a) of the Act establishes a property interest does not appear to be compelled by the values that justify abstention.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1338-4\">Thus, neither of the alternative constructions of \u00a7 25(a) by a federal court would substantially implicate the concerns manifested in the <em>Pullman </em>abstention doctrine. Indeed, in view of the fact that McKnight\u2019s \u201cliberty\u201d claim is being remanded to the district court, were that court now to abstain from reviewing McKnight\u2019s \u201cproperty\u201d claim, McKnight would be placed in the cumbersome position of having to litigate concurrently in two forums issues pertaining to the same congery of facts. The economic burden that would be placed upon McKnight and the inevitable delay in vindicating his constitutionally guaranteed rights, as well as the unnecessary duplication of federal and state judicial efforts, render such an approach unwise.</p>\n<p id=\"aue-dedup-0\">Although had we been faced with the abstention problem in the first instance, the foregoing considerations would have shaped our decision, we are unprepared \u2014 at least at this time \u2014 to declare that the district court has abused its discretion in choosing to abstain.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Nevertheless, in view of the fact that remand is necessitated by the disposition we have reached regarding McKnight\u2019s \u201cliberty\u201d interest, we suggest that the district court consider the question of McKnight\u2019s \u201cproperty\u201d interest as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b1338-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1338-9\">The judgment of the district court will be vacated, and the case remanded to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1328-8\">. McKnight asserts also that, in subsequent unemployment compensation proceedings, SEPTA officials arbitrarily altered their explanation of the justification for the discharge because of their inability to prove his intoxication.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1328-9\">. The district court noted in this regard that recently this Court has declined to decide the issue of municipal liability directly under the Fourteenth Amendment, see <em>Gagliardi v. Fling, </em>564 F.2d 112, 116 (3d Cir. 1977), and <em>Mahone v. Waddle, </em>564 F.2d 1019, 1024 (3d Cir. 1977), and that until there is a \u201cdefinitive ruling\u201d by this Court on the subject, it would adhere to the view expressed in <em>Jones, </em>429 F.Supp. 848 (E.D.Pa.1977). <em>See </em>438 F.Supp. at 817.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1328-15\">. <em>See </em>438 F.Supp. at 822, and 823, where the district court wrote:</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-16\">In my view, however, given the lack of state law clarity and the importance and sensitive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1233\">*1233</page-number>nature of the state policies implicated in this case, the considerations of federalism underlying the <em>Pullman </em>abstention doctrine outweigh whatever inconvenience plaintiff may suffer. I therefore shall adhere to the decision . that whether a SEPTA employee has a property interest in his job is an unsettled question of state law which initially should be decided by the Pennsylvania courts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1329-11\">. The district court also rejected McKnight\u2019s contention that he was denied a right to substantive due process, saying that it \u201cmust be linked to his alleged property interest in employment or liberty interest in reputation.\u201d Also, the district court said that \u201cthe substantive due process claim appears to be a disguised duplicate of plaintiffs pendent state claim under the Metropolitan Transportation Authorities Act . . . \u201d 438 F.Supp. at 827. Because of our resolution of the issues pertaining to McKnight\u2019s claim for procedural due process, we do not consider it necessary to treat separately his argument regarding substantive due process. The latter is, as the district court noted, closely linked with McKnight\u2019s position relating to his \u201cliberty\u201d and \u201cproperty\u201d interests.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1330-8\">. 436 U.S. at 690, 98 S.Ct. at 2036.

Having vacated that portion of the district court\u2019s order dealing with the reach of \u00a7 1983, we consider that it is not necessary to address the additional question whether SEPTA may be liable for damages directly under the Fourteenth Amendment. That matter should be dealt with in an appropriate case. However, just as the district court assumed that at least declaratory and injunctive relief can be obtained in this case, so shall we, and thus we proceed to the merits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1330-11\">. <em>See </em>Pennock, <em>Introduction, NOMOS XVIII: Due Process </em>xv (J.
