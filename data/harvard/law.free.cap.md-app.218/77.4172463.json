Maryland once boasted as many as 47 drive-ins;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> today, however, only Bengies Drive-In Movie Theatre (\u201cBengies\u201d) remains. This case involves a jury\u2019s verdict in favor of Bengies against Royal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>Farms for private nuisance. The jury awarded Bengies $838,000.00 in damages to construct a fence to block light that emanates at night from the Royal Farms. The Circuit Court for Baltimore County considered Royal Farms\u2019 Motion for Judgment Notwithstanding the Verdict (\u201cJNOV\u201d) and, after concluding there was insufficient evidence for a jury to find a private nuisance, set the jury\u2019s verdict aside and entered judgment in favor of Royal Farms.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">On appeal, Bengies, through its operator Blue Ink, Ltd., presents one question for our review,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which we have rephrased as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-6\">Was the evidence presented at trial, when viewed in the light most favorable to Bengies Drive-In, legally sufficient for the jury to find the existence of a private nuisance by a preponderance of the evidence?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">Two Farms, Inc. (doing business as \u201cRoyal Farms\u201d) filed a Cross-Appeal raising an additional issue, which we have rephrased as follows:<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-8\">In the event this Court concludes that the trial court erred in granting the Motion for JNOV, did Blue Ink Limited meet its burden to prove damages using the proper measure of damages?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-9\">Maryland requires that in order to recover for private nuisance, a plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendant\u2019s interference with plaintiffs property rights is both unreasonable and substantial, and that the harm or inconvenience created by such interference is \u201cobjectively reasonable\u201d to the ordinary person. Accordingly, we find the evidence presented at trial was not legally sufficient to support a jury verdict in favor of Bengies against Royal Farms for a private nuisance. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>In light of this holding, we do not address the Cross-Appeal. We affirm the judgment of the Circuit Court for Baltimore County.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">A. The Bengies Drive-In</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">In the late 1950s, Jack K. Vogel and his three brothers constructed Bengies Drive-In, which has remained a family business since its establishment. Eventually, D. Edward Vogel (\u201cMr. Vogel\u201d) began operating the drive-in and in 2000, negotiated a buy-lease agreement to purchase Bengies from his parents, Jack and Aileen Vogel. In order to facilitate a commercial loan in connection with the transfer,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Mr. Vogel needed to ensure that the property was accurately zoned. During the re-zoning process, Mr. Vogel entered into a Restrictive Covenant Agreement, dated August 25, 2004, with a community group called Bowleys Quarters Improvement Association. The Association agreed to forego opposition to the zoning reclassification in exchange for Bengies\u2019 agreement limiting future expansions on the property to an indoor theatre, a second outdoor drive-in screen, miniature golf, batting cages, a restaurant, a dairy bar, cell communications, and a souvenir shop. Drawings exhibiting two possible locations for a second screen accompanied the Agreement. Mr. Vogel officially acquired the property in December 2007, but apart from a cell communications tower, none of the other improvements were constructed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>Today, Bengies is located at 3417 Eastern Boulevard in an area that has been commercially developed for many years. Other businesses surrounding Bengies and pre-dating the Royal Farms include a Wal-Mart, McDonald\u2019s, Home Depot, Rite-Aid, and a restaurant called \u201cBy the Docks.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">B. <em>The Royal Farms</em></p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">Peppermint Woods, Ltd. owns the property at 3300 Eastern Boulevard located on the opposite side of Eastern Boulevard across from Bengies.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In 2003, Peppermint Woods, Ltd. filed a petition for special exception with the Zoning Commissioner of Baltimore County for the construction of a service station and accompanying carryout restaurant and rollover car wash. Mr. Vogel attended the public hearing on special exception to represent Bengies\u2019 interests. The Zoning Commissioner granted the petition, subject to submission of \u201ca landscape and lighting plan for review and approval by the Office of Planning and Avery Harden, Landscape Architect for Baltimore County\u201d that \u201cprovide[s] sufficient screening so that security lights, permanent lighting and vehicle headlines do not inappropriately spill onto adjacent properties, particularly the Bengies Drive-In Movie Theater.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">Avery Harden and the Office of Planning thereafter approved the plans for the construction of a convenience store, gas pumps, and a car wash. In an e-mail dated October 8, 2008, Avery Harden stated, \u201cAll together [Royal Farms\u2019 use of new LED technology] sounds like a precedent setting lighting design for convenience stores in Baltimore County. I can now point to this for others to follow. The drive-in should be fine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b104-8\">The Royal Farms opened its doors for business in December 2008. The general layout of the subject Royal Farms may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>be described as follows:<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-5\">[T]he gas station aspect of the facility consists of a number of gasoline pumps located below a canopy of the type designed to protect those pumping gas from inclement weather. The canopy runs parallel to Eastern Boulevard; the pumps are located below it. The pumps are illuminated by Crossover Ambient Canopy Lights and Crossover Focus Canopy Lights, which are aimed downward from the canopy to allow those pumping gas at night to see. Behind the canopy sits the Royal Farms convenience store, 3936 square feet in size.... Behind the convenience store sits a car wash.... There are parking spaces about the convenience store, illuminated by lighting mounted on the poles pointed downwards toward the parking spaces.... There are several lighted signs\u2014white, green and blue in color on and about the convenience store property ... which can be seen from the drive-in....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">Mr. Vogel filed an official complaint about the Royal Farms lights with Baltimore County Department of Code Enforcement (the \u201cDepartment\u201d). In 2010, when the Department declined to issue a citation for the lights, Mr. Vogel sought a Writ of Mandamus from the Circuit Court for Baltimore County, requesting that the court compel the Department to issue a citation. The circuit court dismissed the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">C. The Litigation</p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">On June 28, 2010, Bengies, by and through Blue Ink, Ltd. and The Last Picture Show, LLC (the landowner), filed a lawsuit against Peppermint Woods, Ltd. and Two Farms, Inc. in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County, alleging claims of negligence, trespass, and private nuisance relating to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>lights emanating from the Royal Farms premises onto Bengies\u2019 property.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> On May 22, 2012, the case proceeded to trial on the negligence and private nuisance claims.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">At trial, Mr. Vogel testified that the lights emitted from the Royal Farms prevent him from executing his plan to build the second screen. He admitted that no artificial light from Royal Farms is aimed or directed at the currently existing screen, but claimed that some of the lights are aimed \u201cinadvertently\u201d at the spot reserved for the second screen by \u201cbouncing off of the poles\u201d located in the back of the theatre. At the time of trial, Mr. Vogel had not initiated the steps necessary to build the second screen, such as applying for a permit. During cross-examination, Mr. Vogel admitted that the potential location for the second screen, as represented in the Covenant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>Agreement, would have been farther away from the Royal Farms store.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\">Mr. Vogel described himself as a diligent owner when monitoring activities affecting the drive-in\u2019s lighting and provided numerous examples of how he has resolved lighting concerns with other local business owners in the area. To provide examples, Mr. Vogel stated that he attended the hearing when the Wal-Mart opened, but ultimately concluded that the lights were not problematic. The Rite-Aid also assisted Mr. Vogel in correcting its light, and the \u201cBy the Docks\u201d restaurant owner replaced his outdoor lights with smaller bulbs to reduce the brightness per Mr. Vogel\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">Mr. Vogel framed the problem in this case as \u201c[t]he light interfer[ing] with the business that thrives on darkness.\u201d When asked during direct examination if there is \u201cany special sensitivity to light in the operation of a drive-in movie theatre,\u201d Mr. Vogel responded that with any theatre, \u201cyou have to watch light, of course, indoor or drive-in.\u201d During cross-examination, Mr. Vogel responded \u201cyes\u201d when asked whether drive-in theatres are unique in their need for darkness. He also conceded that if he owned a tire store or a doctor\u2019s office, the lights probably would not bother him and that he could not \u201cthink of any other occupation that would require that unique night sky.\u201d When asked whether he was sensitive to light, Mr. Vogel admitted that he was, explaining, \u201cI\u2019ve been trained to, in the art of projection and I am, I know how to keep that picture correct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">According to Mr. Vogel, attendance and profits at Bengies have increased annually. Further, Mr. Vogel did not receive customer complaints about the Royal Farms lights, even though he has a method in place for receiving complaints and had received complaints about other matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">Both parties called several witnesses to testify about whether the Royal Farms lights created a nuisance to Bengies. On behalf of Bengies, Dr. Brett Levinson, qualified as an expert in ophthalmology, provided testimony about the anatomy and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>mechanics of the human eye. To a reasonable degree of scientific certainty, Dr. Levinson opined that the blue and green lights emanating from Royal Farms, which is situated in viewers\u2019 peripheral vision, are \u201cstimuli that\u2019s very well picked up by the retina\u201d and that eyes are \u201chighly sensitized to things at night, especially low light and blue greens.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">Bruce Dunlop, qualified as an expert in lighting design, opined to a reasonable degree of scientific certainty that the \u201cRoyal Farms store\u2019s lights creates [sic] a distraction for the moviegoer at the Bengies\u201d and that \u201clight pollution exists at the Bengies.\u201d Mr. Dunlop defined light pollution as \u201clight that emanates from the property and causes harm or inconvenience to another\u201d and light trespass as \u201clight that is generated on one property and impinges on another.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">Mr. Dunlop also testified that \u201c[o]ne reason [the lights create a distraction], other than the brightness and proximity of the lights to the patron, is the color of the light. The lighting at the Farms stores is cool white LED\u2019s and cool white metal halide sources, both of which the eye is sensitive to at night.\u201d He noted that eyes are also sensitive to blue and green lights at nighttime. Specifically, Mr. Dunlop testified that the pylon sign, the gas canopy, and the accent lights on the advertising above the pumps and car wash are the brightest lights. The accent lights refer to advertising panels above the pumps; these panels have LED accent lights, which are aimed to illuminate a vertical surface. In doing so, the lights reflect light off of the blue and green signs. In order to resolve the light pollution, Mr. Dunlop concluded that a barrier could block the light physically.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>Avery Harden was also called to testify on behalf of Bengies, and said that he thought the glare coming from lights over the pumps at the Royal Farms was a problem, but that \u201c[th]ere is a traffic signal that would be a little more off to the right ... than the Royal Farm that could be an issue too.\u201d When asked whether Baltimore County made a determination about the Royal Farms\u2019 lights, Mr. Harden replied, \u201cYeah, we judged it to be in compliance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\">On behalf of Royal Farms, Jayme Leonard, qualified as an expert in the discipline of lighting convenience stores and gas stations, opined that Royal Farms\u2019 site was very well-contained and did not generate light pollution; in fact, he believed that the lighting was too low for security purposes. Mr. Leonard also testified that from a foot candle measurement, there is no light pollution or light trespass from the Royal Farms store onto Bengies\u2019 property. Mr. Leonard based his opinions on his visual observations, not from meter measurements.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">Timothy Michael Kotroco, the former Director of Baltimore County\u2019s Department of Permits and Development Management, testified about investigating Mr. Vogel\u2019s formal complaint regarding Royal Farms\u2019 light. In his opinion, \u201cthere wasn\u2019t anything occurring that could infringe upon the people\u2019s enjoyment there to watch a movie\u201d and \u201cthe lights from the Royal Farms store did not inappropriately spill onto the Bengies Drive-In.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">On the issue of damages, Joseph Stallmann, Jr., president of Olympic Fence and Guardrail, testified that he consulted with Mr. Vogel about constructing an 850 x 25 foot stone wall to shield Bengies from Royal Farms\u2019 light. An exhibit admitted into evidence estimated the cost of construction as $798,000.00. Francesco Taliano, a partner at Patuxent Insurance Group, testified that the annual insurance premium for a fence of that size would be $10,000.00. This figure is based on the value of the fence, as opposed to its size.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">At the close of evidence, the circuit court granted Royal Farms\u2019 Motion for Judgment as to the negligence claim, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>denied its Motion as to the private nuisance claim. The jury-found in favor of Bengies and awarded $838,000.00 in damages, valuing the cost of constructing a fence to shield Bengies from Royal Farms\u2019 lights and an insurance policy. On July 9, 2012, Royal Farms filed a Motion for JNOV or, in the alternative, Motion for New Trial. On September 13, 2012, the circuit court issued a Memorandum Opinion and Order granting Royal Farms\u2019 Motion for JNOV.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">The court observed that the jury was provided with \u201cscant proof\u2019 depicting the actual lighting conditions at the drive-in at night; that neither party requested a view of the properties pursuant to Maryland Rule 2-515; and that, overall, there was \u201clittle objective evidence presented as to the intrusive or non-intrusive effect of the Royal Farms\u2019 lighting on the drive-in.\u201d The court noted that no customer testified that the lights from the Royal Farms store ever interfered with their viewing experience, and that \u201cMr. Vogel actually testified that \u2018[e]ach year [business] increases and it has had that habit since 1989 when I took over.\u2019 \u201d Plaintiffs evidence was beside the point:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Al\">Exhibits 10 through 15, introduced by Plaintiff strictly for the purpose of showing the locations of light meter readings, reflect objectively that the Farm Stores\u2019 lighting does not sit behind the movie screen, or anywhere near the movie screen, so as to diminish or distort the projected movie picture, but rather is located off to the right of the movie screen and on the far side of Eastern Boulevard\u2014at a distance from the Bengies property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">Based on what was presented at trial, the court found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-7\">All of the evidence adduced in this case, demonstrative and testimonial, established that Royal Farms lighting is not aimed, directed or oriented towards the Bengies property. The evidence established that the Royal Farms\u2019 light does not encroach onto the Bengies property or otherwise intrude or spill across Eastern Boulevard onto the drive-in land. And the evidence established that the Royal Farms\u2019 lighting is located away from the Bengies picture screen on a horizontal plane and does not distort or diminish the image projected onto the picture screen. At best, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>evidence established that a movie patron\u2019s attention could be drawn to the Royal Farms\u2019 operation by the color or the brightness of the Royal Farms\u2019 lighting as he or she watched a movie.... Bruce Dunlop, a lighting designer who testified not that the Royal Farms\u2019 lighting interfered with the projection of movie images at the Bengies at night, but rather, that because of the color and/or intensity of the Royal Farms\u2019 lights in the distance, theater patrons could be distracted.... The evidence also established that ... patrons could be distracted by the \u201cBy the Docks\u201d lighting or the other visible lighting along Eastern Boulevard.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">In its analysis, the court surveyed cases from Maryland and from other jurisdictions determining that drive-ins could not maintain a nuisance action due to the light-sensitive nature of their industry. The court noted that Mr. Vogel admitted that his drive-in was especially sensitive and found that the location of the drive-in \u201cin the midst of other commercial and retail establishments which must be adequately lit to do business at night makes the case for a finding of nuisance due to light spillage all the more impossible.\u201d Considering both Maryland and other jurisdictions\u2019 case law, the court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-6\">It is beyond any reasonable dispute that the drive-in operation involved in this action is one that is peculiarly sensitive to light, and that this drive-in\u2019s owner, Mr. Vogel, is a particularly sensitive drive-in owner. In any event, this Court finds that the evidentiary record in this action does not support a conclusion that light emanating from the Royal Farms\u2019 location would constitute a nuisance to a business \u201cno more than ordinarily susceptible to light\u201d such as another convenience store, a restaurant or any other commercial or industrial use. If the business located on the Bengies property was a 7 Eleven or a Walmart or a car dealership, there would not be even a colorable claim for nuisance based on light spillage. Therefore, the verdict reflecting a finding of nuisance cannot stand.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">(footnote omitted). The court continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-8\">Even assuming, however, that Maryland law or a common law principle recognized elsewhere allowed this verdict to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>stand, the facts presented simply do not allow for a rational jury conclusion that Royal Farms\u2019 lighting constitutes a nuisance to the drive-in. The Royal Farms\u2019 lighting is not aimed or directed or oriented towards the drive-in.... There is simply no reasoned or rational basis to conclude that these very typical and ordinary commercial lights, employed lawfully by a business on the far side of the road from the drive-in could conceivably have constituted the type of substantial and unreasonable interference with the operation of the drive-in required by Maryland Law before a fact-finder can conclude that there is nuisance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">Accordingly, the circuit court set aside the judgment in favor of Bengies and entered judgment in favor of Royal Farms.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">It is the responsibility of the court to aid a jury in the correct discharge of its duty and to correct error.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The Maryland Rules equip circuit courts with several means to minimize or correct trial errors. <em>Gen. Motors Corp. v. Seay, </em>388 Md. 341, 352-53, 879 A.2d 1049 (2005) (discussing the legislative history of Maryland Rule 2-532). Maryland Rule 2-532, which governs motions for JNOV, is intended \u201cto <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>reduce costs to litigants and promote time efficiency by reducing both retrials and duplicate trials due to errors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 352, 879 A.2d 1049. A motion for JNOV under Rule 2-532 \u201ctests the legal sufficiency of the evidence.\u201d <em>Impala Platinum, Ltd. v. Impala Sales (USA), Inc., </em>283 Md. 296, 326, 389 A.2d 887 (1978). It gives the circuit court a last chance to order the judgment that the law requires. <em>See, e.g., Goss v. Estate of Jennings, </em>207 Md.App. 151, 174, 51 A.3d 761 (2012) (affirming a circuit court\u2019s grant of JNOV because it was \u201capparent that the evidence was legally insufficient to establish\u201d negligence); <em>Gallagher v. H.V. Pierhomes, LLC, </em>182 Md.App. 94, 957 A.2d 628 (2008) (affirming a circuit court\u2019s grant of JNOV because the evidence presented at trial was \u201clegally insufficient to support the imposition of strict liability in tort for the conduct in issue, or to establish a private or public nuisance\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\">On review of a circuit court\u2019s decision to grant or deny a motion for JNOV, we are concerned with the dichotomy between the role of the judge, to apply the law, and the role of the jury, to decide the facts. As we explained in <em>Pickett v. Haislip, </em>73 Md.App. 89, 98, 533 A.2d 287 (1987), \u201c[o]nly where reasonable minds cannot differ in the conclusions to be drawn from the evidence, after it has been viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, does the issue in question become one of law for the court and not of fact for the jury.\u201d Although we review the circuit court\u2019s legal findings <em>de novo, MBC Realty, LLC v. Mayor &amp; City Council of Balt., </em>192 Md.App. 218, 233, 993 A.2d 1190 (2010), we must determine \u201cwhether on the evidence presented a reasonable fact-finder could find the elements of the cause of action by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>Univ. of Md. Med. Sys. Corp. v. Gholston, </em>203 Md.App. 321, 329, 37 A.3d 1074 <em>cert. denied, </em>427 Md. 65, 46 A.3d 406 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">Bengies argues that the circuit court erred in granting Royal Farms\u2019 Motion for JNOV because Bengies presented sufficient evidence at trial upon which the jury could conclude that the Royal Farms lights caused an unreasonable and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>substantial interference with the use and enjoyment of its property. As Bengies correctly argues on appeal, if the record presents any evidence, however slight, from which the jury could have reached its verdict, then Royal Farms is not entitled to a JNOY. <em>Nationwide Mut. Fire Ins. Co. v. Tufts, </em>118 Md.App. 180, 190-91, 702 A.2d 422 (1997) (citing <em>Houston v. Safeway Stores, Inc., </em>109 Md.App. 177, 183, 674 A.2d 87 (1996)). Applying this standard, we find that the circuit court correctly set aside the jury\u2019s verdict where the evidence did not support a private nuisance action.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">The concept of nuisance is deeply-rooted in common law and in Maryland case law. <em>Wash. Suburban Sanitary Comm\u2019n v. CAE-Link Corp., </em>330 Md. 115, 124, 622 A.2d 745 (1993). Although the doctrine originally aimed to safeguard private landowners from being dispossessed of their property, it evolved to protect private landowners from \u201csubstantial interferences\u201d with the possession of land. <em>Wietzke v. Chesapeake Conference Ass\u2019n, </em>421 Md. 355, 373-74, 26 A.3d 931 (2011) (citing David A. Thomas, Thompson on Real Property \u00a7 67.01.02, at 111, 113 (2d ed. 2010 Supp.)).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Maryland courts have adopted Section 821D of the Restatement (Second) of Torts (1965), which more narrowly defines a private nuisance as \u201ca nontrespassory invasion of another\u2019s interest in the private use or enjoyment of land.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Rosenblatt v. Exxon Co., U.S.A., </em>335 Md. 58, 80, 642 A.2d 180 (1994); <em>Exxon Corp. v. Yarema, </em>69 Md.App. 124, 147, 516 A.2d 990 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\"> Nuisance is not confined to physical intrusions onto another\u2019s property; rather, it broadly encompasses all tangible invasions, including noise, odor, and light. <em>Yarema, </em>69 Md.App. at 147, 516 A.2d 990. And, although there is no requirement that a plaintiff demonstrate physical injury from an alleged nuisance, a plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendant\u2019s interference with the plaintiffs property rights is both unreasonable and substantial in order to recover for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>nuisance. <em>Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Albright (Albright I), </em>433 Md. 303, 409-11, 71 A.3d 30 <em>modified on other grounds, Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Albright (Albright II), </em>433 Md. 502, 71 A.3d 150 (2013); <em>accord Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Ford, </em>433 Md. 426, 485-86, 71 A.3d 105 (2013) (following <em>Albright I\u2019s </em>rationale and concluding that appellees with potable wells that had not tested positive for contamination failed to show substantial interference sufficient to sustain actions in nuisance).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">The case before us involves an action for a private nuisance \u201cin fact\u201d as opposed to a nuisance <em>per se. </em>\u201cA nuisance <em>per se </em>is an act, occupation, or structure which is a nuisance at all times and under any circumstances regardless of location or surroundings[,]\u201d whereas \u201c[a] nuisance in fact is an act, occupation, or structure, not a nuisance <em>per se, </em>but one which becomes a nuisance by reason of the circumstances, location, or surroundings.\u201d <em>Adams v. Commis. of Trappe, </em>204 Md. 165, 170, 102 A.2d 830 (1954). More than a century ago, the Court of Appeals explained that not all interference to neighboring landowners will justify limiting the reasonable use of property:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-6\">In determining the question of nuisance in such cases, the locality and all the surrounding circumstances should be taken into consideration; and [], where expensive works have been erected and carried on, which are useful and needful to the public, <em>persons must not stand on extreme rights, </em>and bring actions in respect of every trifling annoyance, otherwise, business could not be carried on in such places. But still, if the result of the trade or business thus carried on is such as to <em>interfere with the physical comfort, by another, of his property, or such as to occasion substantial injury to the property itself, </em>there is a wrong to the neighboring owner for which an action will lie.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b115-7\"><em>Susquehanna Fertilizer Co. v. Malone, </em>73 Md. 268, 280, 20 A. 900 (1890) (emphasis added). Thus, a finding of nuisance involves \u201ca balance of the competing property interests at stake.\u201d <em>Wietzke, </em>421 Md. at 382-83, 26 A.3d 931. The nuisance must, in the judgment of reasonable individuals, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>create a condition that is \u201cnaturally productive of actual physical discomfort to persons of ordinary sensibilities, tastes, and habits\u201d and, in light of the circumstances, is \u201cunreasonable and in derogation of the rights of the party.\u201d <em>Meadowbrook Swimming Club v. Albert, </em>173 Md. 641, 645, 197 A. 146 (1938) (citing <em>Hamilton Corp. v. Julian, </em>130 Md. 597, 101 A. 558 (1917); <em>Woodyear v. Schaefer, </em>57 Md. 1, 12 (1881)).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the parties do not dispute that light may amount to nuisance when it substantially interferes with another\u2019s reasonable use and enjoyment of his or her property. Instead, the parties dispute whether Bengies, as an establishment that requires darkness to operate, may demand that Royal Farms modify the lighting on its property so that it cannot be seen at night from Bengies\u2019 property. Royal Farms argues that under Maryland private nuisance law, Bengies\u2019 need for darkness was extreme, and the evidence produced at trial was insufficient because it failed to demonstrate objective harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">A finding of private nuisance requires a two-part analysis: (1) viewing the defendant\u2019s activity, was the interference unreasonable and substantial? and (2) viewing the plaintiffs alleged harm, was the inconvenience or harm caused by the interference objectively reasonable? First, the court found that Bengies failed to present sufficient evidence to demonstrate that Royal Farms\u2019 use of its lights at nighttime was unreasonable and substantial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-7\">The Royal Farms\u2019 lighting is not aimed or directed or oriented towards the drive-in.... There is simply no reasoned or rational basis to conclude that these very typical and ordinary commercial lights, employed lawfully by a business on the far side of the road from the drive-in could conceivably have constituted the type of substantial and unreasonable interference with the operation of the drive-in required by Maryland Law before a fact-finder can conclude that there is nuisance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b116-8\">No testimony was presented to demonstrate that the Royal Farms lights were <em>unreasonable </em>based on its location, given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>that Eastern Boulevard is a heavily-traveled road flanking many commercial businesses, such as Wal-Mart and McDonald\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">Second, Bengies failed to demonstrate that the alleged harm or inconvenience was objectively reasonable. The Court of Appeals explained the second part of the private nuisance analysis in <em>Albright I, </em>a case involving an underground gasoline spill. In addressing the \u201cnon-detect appellees,\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> the Court instructed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-6\">Appellees\u2019 adjustments in the use of their properties appear to derive not from Exxon\u2019s actual interference \"with their property, but rather from their fear of contamination and its possible impacts. In order to recover for nuisance, however, a plaintiff must establish that any adjustments he, she or it makes in the use of his, her, or its property as a result of the defendant\u2019s tortious conduct are objectively reasonable .... [T]hese Appellees\u2019 fear of future contamination and resultant effects thus far is not objectively reasonable ... in the absence of physical injury to real property resulting from Exxon\u2019s actions, Appellees must demonstrate more than modest adjustments in their use of their real property resulting from the leak in order to establish nuisance.[<footnotemark>15</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b117-7\"><em>Id. </em>(Emphasis added). Thus, in determining whether the Appellees in <em>Albright I </em>were inconvenienced or harmed by the underground gasoline spill, the Court applied an objective rather than a subjective test. This principle\u2014that the alleged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>inconvenience be \u201cobjectively reasonable\u201d\u2014was recently illustrated by our decision in <em>Schuman v. Greenbelt Homes, Inc., </em>212 Md.App. 451, 456, 69 A.3d 512 (2013), a case involving a hyper-sensitive plaintiff. David Schuman lived in a townhome adjacent to Darco and Svetlana Popovic. <em>Id. </em>at 456, 69 A.3d 512. The Popovics smoked cigarettes, and Mr. Schuman claimed that their cigarette smoke infiltrated the common wall shared by their townhomes. <em>Id. </em>Unable to resolve the issue out of court, Mr. Schuman filed a complaint against the Popovics in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County for breach of contract, nuisance, trespass, negligence, and permanent injunctions.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>After a trial on the merits, the circuit court granted Mr. Schuman\u2019s request for a permanent injunction against Mr. Popovic\u2019s indoor smoking pursuant to Mr. Popovic\u2019s consent; however, the court found in the Popovics\u2019 favor on all remaining counts. <em>Id. </em>at 459, 69 A.3d 512. Mr. Schuman appealed, arguing, <em>inter alia, </em>that the circuit court erred in ruling in the Popovics\u2019 favor on the nuisance claim. <em>Id. </em>at 459-60, 69 A.3d 512. This Court explained that in order to identify a nuisance in fact, we must consider what \u201cordinary people, acting reasonably, have a right to demand in the way of health and comfort under all the circumstances\u201d and that \u201cit is not enough if a particular plaintiff is \u2018offended or annoyed if he is particularly sensitive.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 470, 69 A.3d 512 (quoting Harper, James &amp; Gray on Torts \u00a7 1.25 (3d ed. 2006)). We explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-5\">While this Court understands that Schuman may have a particular sensitivity to the smell of smoke, <em>nuisance is not subjective. </em>The circuit court did not have to ignore, and was free to determine, that Schuman did not prove a substantial interference for a reasonable person by a preponderance of the evidence. It was reasonable to find that Mr. Popovic\u2019s smoke would not cause physical discomfort <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>and annoyance of persons of ordinary sensibilities, nor would it seriously interfere with the comfort and enjoyment of the average person\u2019s home.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b119-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 473, 69 A.3d 512 (emphasis added). Because the plaintiff was unable to show that the inconvenience caused by the defendants\u2019 smoking was \u201cobjectively reasonable,\u201d in that an ordinary person would be offended or harmed by the smoke, we affirmed the court\u2019s ruling on the nuisance claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">In the matter before us, the circuit court correctly noted that other state jurisdictions, in accord with Maryland\u2019s objective nuisance standard, have applied the standard in cases addressing whether a drive-in movie theatre can maintain a private nuisance claim based on an adjacent property owner\u2019s lights. For example, in <em>Amphitheaters, Inc. v. Portland Meadows, </em>184 Or. 336, 198 P.2d 847 (1948), an outdoor drive-in theatre filed a lawsuit against the race track adjacent to its property, alleging claims of trespass and nuisance based on the race track\u2019s evening lighting. The race track\u2019s flood lights were generally aimed at the track, but the evidence indicated that the light spilled onto the drive-in theatre\u2019s premises. <em>Id. </em>at 850. In the absence of any binding precedent, the Supreme Court of Oregon reviewed the fundamentals of nuisance jurisprudence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-7\">No action will lie for a nuisance in respect of damage which, even though substantial, is due solely to the fact that the plaintiff <em>is abnormally sensitive </em>to deleterious influences, or uses his land for some purpose which requires <em>exceptional freedom from any such influences </em>.... \u2018So if I carry on a manufacture or other business which is so sensitive to adverse influences that it suffers damage from smoke, fumes, vibrations, or heat, which would in no way interfere with the ordinary occupation of land, the law of nuisance will not confer upon me any such special and extraordinary protection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b119-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 853 (emphasis added) (quoting Salmond on the Law of Torts 238, 239 (9th ed. 1936)). The court ultimately held, as a matter of law, \u201cthat the loss sustained by the plaintiff by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>spilled light which has been reflected onto the highly sensitized moving picture screen from the defendant\u2019s property 832 feet distant\u201d is a loss without injury. <em>Id. </em>at 858.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">Similarly, in <em>Belmar Drive-In Theatre Co. v. Illinois State Toll Highway, </em>34 Ill.2d 544, 216 N.E.2d 788 (1966), Belmar Drive-In Theatre Company filed an action against the Illinois State Toll Highway Commission, as well as the operators of business concessions at a toll-road service center, seeking damages caused by the bright lights emanating from the toll center adjacent to the theatre. <em>Id. </em>at 790. The Supreme Court of Illinois reviewed persuasive authority for guidance:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A5\">[As] stated in Joyce, Law of Nuisances, sec. 26, in this manner: \u201c * * * But the doing of something not in itself noxious does not become a nuisance merely because it does harm to some particular trade of a delicate nature in the adjoining property where it does not affect any ordinary trade carried on there nor interfere with the ordinary enjoyment of life. <em>A man who carries on an exceptionally delicate trade cannot complain because it is injured by his neighbor doing something lawful on his property, if it is something which would not injure an ordinary trade or anything but an exceptionally delicate trade.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b120-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 791 (emphasis added) (internal citations omitted). And, specifically in regard to cases alleging light as a nuisance:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ACm\">Again, it is stated in 5 A.L.R.2d 705: \u201cThe private nuisance light cases, considered as a whole, seem to warrant the generalization that if the intensity of light shining from adjoining land is strong enough to seriously disturb a person of ordinary sensibilities, or interfere with an occupation which is no more ordinarily susceptible to light, it is a nuisance; if not, there is no cause of action. <em>The courts will not afford protection to hypersensitive individuals or industries.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b120-7\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added) (internal citations omitted). Relying on these authorities, the court affirmed the trial court\u2019s dismissal of the nuisance count. <em>Id.; see also Sheridan Drive-In Theatre, Inc. v. Wyo., </em>384 P.2d 597, 600-01 (Wyo.1963) (affirm<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>ing the trial court\u2019s directed verdict in favor of the defendant on Sheridan Drive-In Theatre\u2019s private nuisance claim based on the lack of damages and evidence of an actionable nuisance, based on the extraordinary and unusual nature of the drive-in\u2019s property use); <em>Lynn Open Air Theatre, Inc. v. Sea Crest Cadillac-Pontiac, Inc., </em>1 Mass.App.Ct. 186, 294 N.E.2d 473 (1973) (noting that the defendant\u2019s lights would not injuriously impact ordinary property owners in a developed, commercial vicinity and that \u201cinjury to a particular user of specially sensitive characteristics does not render the lights an actionable nuisance\u201d (citations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">In the present case, the circuit court properly concluded that a reasonable fact-finder could not have found a private nuisance under Maryland law by a preponderance of the evidence presented at trial. Specifically, the court observed that, overall, there was \u201clittle objective evidence presented as to the intrusive or non-intrusive effect of the Royal Farms\u2019 lighting on the drive-in.\u201d Mr. Vogel, the proprietor of Bengies, testified that the lights from the Royal Farms, located across Eastern Boulevard (a heavily-travelled road in a commercial district), interfered with his current business and prevented him from constructing a second drive-in screen on his property. He also admitted, however, that he never took the necessary steps to begin construction of a second screen, and that the potential location for the second screen, as represented in the Covenant Agreement, would have been even farther away from the Royal Farms store.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">Mr. Vogel admitted several times that a drive-in is a unique business in its need for darkness to operate. He also conceded that if he owned a tire store or a doctor\u2019s office, the lights probably would not bother him and that he could not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>\u201cthink of any other occupation that would require that unique night sky.\u201d As noted <em>supra, </em>Mr. Vogel framed the problem in this case as \u201c[t]he light interfering] with the business that thrives on darkness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">Mr. Vogel, who conceded that he is personally sensitive to light, testified that the lights caused harm to the drive-in. No other evidence was presented that an ordinary person, or even patrons or employees of the drive-in, were ever harmed or inconvenienced by the lights at the Royal Farms. Instead, the testimony was that Bengies had no complaints from customers about the lights, even though Bengies had a method in place for receiving complaints and had received complaints about other matters. And, although Bengies presented expert testimony to support its claim that the lights interfered with the drive-in, <em>Albright II, </em>433 Md. at 504-05, 71 A.3d 150 the testimony did not link the <em>possibility </em>of interference with testimony that any objectively reasonable actual harm or inconvenience occurred. Dr. Brett Levinson, qualified as an expert in ophthalmology, testified that Royal Farms\u2019 blue and green lights <em>could </em>affect a viewer\u2019s vision at nighttime, and Bruce Dunlop, qualified as an expert in lighting design, opined that the Royal Farms lights <em>could </em>create a distraction to moviegoers, but they also had to admit that lighting from other sources on the same Eastern Avenue horizon <em>could </em>distract moviegoers.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">Bengies established that it is uniquely sensitive to light, but a private nuisance action cannot be maintained based solely on the special sensitivities of a plaintiff. <em>Schuman, </em>212 Md.App. at 470, 69 A.3d 512. As the circuit court explained in its Memorandum Opinion, \u201cthe evidentiary record in this action does not support a conclusion that light emanating from the Royal Farms\u2019 location would constitute a nuisance to a business \u2018no more than ordinarily susceptible to light\u2019 such as another convenience store, a restaurant or any other commercial or industrial use.\u201d Because Maryland requires that a plaintiff demonstrate that the defendant\u2019s interference with the plaintiffs property rights is both unreasonable and substantial in order to recover for nuisance, <em>Albright I, </em>433 Md. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>409-11, 71 A.3d 30 and that the inconvenience created by the interference be one that is \u201cobjectively reasonable\u201d to the ordinary person, <em>id., </em>we find the evidence presented at trial was not legally sufficient to support a jury verdict in favor of Bengies against Royal Farms for a private nuisance.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\">We clarify that we do not hold that a drive-in cannot ever maintain an action for a private nuisance. Certainly a scenario could exist in which the lights emanating from an adjacent property could support a private nuisance action, but those lights must be so intrusive as to interfere with an ordinary business\u2019s reasonable, ordinary use of its property. The evidence in this case simply did not present such a scenario. <em>Cf. Gallagher, supra, </em>182 Md.App. at 113-14, 957 A.2d 628 (affirming a circuit court\u2019s grant of JNOV based on insufficient evidence to prove private nuisance). We do not believe the evidence at trial shows that the Royal Farms lights will substantially impact Bengies\u2019 continuing vitality as Maryland\u2019s last remaining outdoor drive-in theatre.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b101-14\">.

Historically, drive-in theaters across the country have contended with nuisance actions brought against them for the antipodal display of light: movie scenes in view of the general public. Intending to prevent youths from viewing obscene films, counties in several states enacted and enforced laws prohibiting drive-ins from screening such films if those films were visible from public property; however, these ordinances had to be carefully crafted in order to satisfy constitutional muster. <em>See Erznoznik v. City of Jacksonville, </em>422 U.S. 205, 95 S.Ct. 2268, 45 L.Ed.2d 125 (1975) (holding that a Jacksonville, Florida ordinance, intended to prohibit youths from viewing obscene films, was facially invalid due to its over-broad language); <em>Rabe v. Washington, </em>405 U.S. 313, 92 S.Ct. 993, 31 L.Ed.2d 258 (1972) (holding that a Washington ordinance was impermissibly vague by failing to afford fair notice that criminal liability could be imposed based on a showing\u2019s location).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">Interestingly, in 1974, the Baltimore County Council passed such an ordinance. Bill No. 8-74, 1974 Leg. (Balt.Cnty., Md. Jan. 7, 1974) (codified at Balt. Cnty.Code \u00a7 21-9-102 (2004)). This ordinance prohibited drive-ins from showing x-rated films that could be seen by the nonpaying public, which was deemed to be a public nuisance, and declared the penalty to be a misdemeanor subject to a fine not to exceed $100. The County then charged the owner of Valley Drive-In under this provision for playing \"Supervixens\u201d in a location visible from a public road. Segrave, <em>supra, </em>at 159. Based on Supreme Court\u2019s decision in the <em>Erznoznik </em>case, the Maryland district court judge threw the charges out, stating \u201cI don\u2019t see how we can stop it.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b106-8\">.

Mr. Dunlop measured the light, or \"luminance,\u201d using the metric of foot lambert, as opposed to foot candela, because foot lambert is the established measurement for obtrusive light pursuant to the Illuminating Engineering Society. Mr. Dunlop testified that \"candela is the specific direction of a beam of light\u201d and \"foot lambert takes into, depending on the luminance meter you\u2019re using, the one degree spot meter measures the luminance at that point.\u201d In other words, \"foot candle is light delivered to a point\u201d and \u201ccandela is the direct brightness of that source.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b112-8\">.
