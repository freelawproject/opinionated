In 2009, when he was terminally ill, regularly taking opiates for pain, and completely dependent upon his brother, who had taken him from Maryland to Kentucky and held him there incommunicado, he executed a second will in which he revoked the earlier will and gave all of his assets to his brother.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-10\">McClintock challenged the second will, contending that it had been procured by fraud and undue influence. After a bench trial that extended over five days, the Circuit Court for Allegany County agreed. As a consequence of that decision, the earlier will, which favored McClintock, became the decedent\u2019s last will and testament. We shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-11\">\n<em>Factual and Procedural History</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b363-12\">The multi-volume record in this case discloses few areas of agreement between the contending parties. Our obligation, however, is not to review and weigh the parties\u2019 respective contentions, but to recount the facts in the light most favorable to McClintock, the party who prevailed below. <em>L.W. Wolfe Enters., Inc. v. Maryland Nat\u2019l Golf, L.P., </em>165 Md.App. 339, 343, 885 A.2d 826 (2005). Those facts are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b363-13\">A. <em>The Parties</em></p>\n<p id=\"b363-14\">1. <em>The Testator, Kenneth Green. </em>The testator, Kenneth Green (\u201cKenneth\u201d), was born on May 20, 1934, and died on January 19, 2010. Kenneth was raised on a farm that was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>owned by his parents in Lonaconing, Maryland. His only sibling was his brother Albert Green (\u201cAlbert\u201d). Kenneth never married and had no children.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">Except for a few brief periods (when he was in the military, when he moved to Ohio for a job, and at the very end of his life), Kenneth spent the entirety of his life on or near the Green farm. For much of his life, he worked for Westvaco in Allegany County.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">Before his father died, Kenneth lived on the farm with his parents, to whom he was devoted. After his father\u2019s death, Kenneth remained on the farm alone, raising cattle and hay. Aside from his mother, the farm and his cattle were the most important things in Kenneth\u2019s life.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">2. <em>The Beneficiary, Albert Green. </em>Kenneth\u2019s brother Albert also worked for Westvaco for many years, but moved to West Virginia, near the border with Garrett County, in 1987. Kenneth\u2019s and Albert\u2019s mother, Ida, joined Albert in West Virginia after their father died. In 1998, a few years after his mother died, Albert retired and moved to Kentucky, where his sons lived.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">3. <em>The Personal Representative, Andrew Green. </em>Albert\u2019s son, Andrew Green (\u201cAndrew\u201d), is the personal representative under the will that has been challenged in this case. Andrew, who lives in Kentucky, had only limited contact with his uncle Kenneth for many years.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-9\"><em>4. The Caveator, Betty McClintock. </em>Betty McClintock was one of Kenneth\u2019s co-workers at Westvaco. During the time when she and Kenneth worked for Westvaco, she spoke with him regularly, on almost a daily basis. Kenneth admired her because she had raised four children on her own after her husband died in an automobile accident in the 1970s.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>The circuit court found that, from the late 1980s onward, Kenneth and McClintock had a long-term, stable, caring, and supportive relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">B. <em>Ida Green\u2019s Death and the Litigation Over Her Estate</em></p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">The roots of the present dispute can be traced back to May 1995, when Kenneth\u2019s and Albert\u2019s mother, Ida, died, without a will to direct who would inherit the Green farm or her other assets. For several years, no one opened an estate on her behalf. Instead, Kenneth continued to live on the farm and to raise cattle and engage in other farming activities there.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">In about 2000 or 2001, Kenneth approached James Oberhaus, the president of Maryland Fuel Corporation, which owned the mineral rights under the Green farm. Kenneth asked Oberhaus for assistance in obtaining sole title to the Green farm. Oberhaus hired John Robb, a local attorney familiar with real estate matters, to assist Kenneth. With Robb\u2019s assistance, Kenneth opened an estate for his mother in August 2002, more than seven years after her death.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">The estate proceedings prompted a dispute between Kenneth and his brother Albert. Kenneth contended that the farm was his and that the $192,000.00 in assets in Ida\u2019s estate were to be divided equally between the brothers; Albert, on the other hand, contended that the farm and the other assets should be divided evenly between the two brothers. In October 2003, the orphans\u2019 court agreed with Albert that the farm should go to the brothers as tenants in common, and Kenneth appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-9\">C. <em>Kenneth\u2019s First Will, in 2003</em></p>\n<p id=\"b365-10\">In the midst of the legal dispute between Kenneth and his brother, Oberhaus (of Maryland Fuel) suggested to Kenneth that he should have a will. Oberhaus was motivated, in part, by the prospect of obtaining title to the surface rights to the Green farm <em>(i.e., </em>the right to strip-mine the farm), which he had previously attempted to obtain from Kenneth. Oberhaus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>referred Kenneth to Maryland Fuel\u2019s lawyer, Donald Nelson, for the purpose of drafting a will.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">Oberhaus arranged Kenneth\u2019s first meeting with Nelson. The meeting took place in Oberhaus\u2019s office, and Oberhaus was present for the first 10 to 15 minutes of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">Kenneth told Nelson that he wanted his entire estate to go to McClintock because she was a hard worker and had devoted a great deal of effort to raising her children after her husband\u2019s death. Neither Nelson nor Oberhaus knew McClintock at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">Kenneth specifically told Nelson that he did not want Albert or Albert\u2019s wife, Stella, to get any of his property. Consistent with that directive, the will makes no provision for Albert or any member of Albert\u2019s family.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-8\">On Nelson\u2019s advice, Kenneth agreed to have the will include a provision that gave Maryland Fuel the option to purchase the Green farm from his estate after his death. The provision contained a mechanism to establish the purchase price. In addition, it directed that if Maryland Fuel exercised the option, the purchase price would go to McClintock.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b366-9\">Kenneth executed the 2003 will at an M &amp; T Bank branch office on March 5, 2003. According to Oberhaus\u2019s employee, Linda Malamis, who was a witness to the will, Kenneth told a bank employee at the time that he wanted to take care of McClintock. In addition, according to the bank employee, Kenneth stated that he disliked Albert\u2019s wife because she wanted all of his money and property and that he did not want Albert\u2019s wife to receive any of his assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>D. <em>The Settlement of the Litigation Concerning Ida Green\u2019s Estate</em></p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">In April 2004, a little over a year after he had executed his will, Kenneth traveled to Kentucky to take Albert\u2019s deposition in his appeal in the litigation concerning their mother\u2019s estate. Kenneth had never previously gone to Kentucky in his life.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">Before any substantive questioning began in the deposition, Kenneth and Albert met privately and reached an agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, Kenneth would receive the Green farm, while Albert would receive all the money in their mother\u2019s estate, except for an advance that Kenneth already received.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">While he was in Kentucky in connection with the deposition and the settlement discussions, Kenneth did not go to Albert\u2019s farm or meet with any of Albert\u2019s family members, including Albert\u2019s son, Andrew, the personal representative under the will that has been challenged in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">E. <em>After the Settlement With Albert</em></p>\n<p id=\"b367-9\">After the settlement with Albert, the personal representatives of the estate conveyed the Green farm to Kenneth. Kenneth later told his neighbor, Jeremy Kiddy, that he had had a hard time getting the farm.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-10\">Over the next several years, Kenneth continued to live alone on the farm and to work the farm. He remained close to a small circle of friends and had no meaningful contact with Albert, Albert\u2019s wife Stella, or Albert\u2019s son Andrew. Kenneth\u2019s friends included Kiddy, who helped him on the farm and saw him on almost a daily basis from 2004 until late July 2009, and McClintock, who accompanied Kenneth on errands and saw him on at least a weekly basis from March 2006 until late July 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-11\">In addition to the farm, Kenneth owned a number of annuities, savings bonds, bank accounts, and brokerage accounts. Beginning in 2004, Kenneth started making McClintock the beneficiary on his accounts. In addition, he enlisted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>the aid of Oberhaus\u2019s employee, Linda Malamis, to make McClintock the payee on his savings bonds upon his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">F. <em>Kenneth\u2019s First Serious Illness, in 2006, and Its Aftermath</em></p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">In May 2006, Kenneth was diagnosed with rectal cancer. Several months earlier, he had given McClintock a healthcare power of attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">After undergoing a colostomy in Morgantown, West Virginia, Kenneth stayed with his niece (Albert\u2019s daughter) Amy Thompson. While he was staying with the Thompsons, however, Kenneth asked McClintock to take him to his chemotherapy treatments.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">Kenneth became distrustful of Thompson\u2019s family, suspecting that someone had gone through the personal papers that he kept in the trunk of his car. He told Malamis that he did not want his family to know his financial situation. He requested that McClintock keep all of his banking and investment records, which she did until September 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-9\">G. <em>The Period from Late 2006 to Early 2009</em></p>\n<p id=\"b368-10\">After several months with the Thompsons, Kenneth returned to the Green farm. Thereafter, McClintock and Kenneth would meet at least weekly, and she would accompany him on his errands. On one of those excursions, Kenneth took McClintock to the Green cemetery, showed her his parents\u2019 graves, and told her that he wanted to be buried beside his parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-11\">During this same period, Kenneth instructed Malamis and the lawyer, Nelson, that he wanted McClintock to inherit all of his assets and that he wanted to leave nothing to his brother and his family. He expressed similar sentiments to his neighbor, Kiddy.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>H. <em>The Onset of Kenneth\u2019s Second and Final Illness</em></p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\">In April 2009, McClintock took Kenneth to his regular physician, who told Kenneth that he was experiencing a relapse. In May 2009, McClintock took Kenneth to an oncologist, who diagnosed Kenneth with metastatic rectal cancer, which had spread to his lungs.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">Around this time, Albert, his son Andrew, and other family members visited Kenneth on the Green farm for Kenneth\u2019s birthday (which was on May 20). After the guests left, Kenneth told Kiddy that he informed Albert and his family that they did not need to worry about the farm because they would not be inheriting it.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">Shortly thereafter, Kenneth underwent surgery. During his recovery, Kenneth stayed with Adam Johnson, his great-nephew (and Albert\u2019s grandson). McClintock continued to see Kenneth once a week during this period.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">I. <em>Kenneth\u2019s Admission to Sacred Heart Hospital</em></p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">On July 31, 2009, McClintock went to visit Kenneth at the home of his great-nephew and saw that he appeared to be very ill. On that day, Kenneth was admitted to Sacred Heart Hospital in Cumberland.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-9\">Upon his admission, Kenneth\u2019s discharge plan was that he would return to the Johnson home upon his release. In fact, the Johnsons requested that home health services from the hospital be made available when Kenneth arrived at their home. While at the hospital, Kenneth was placed on a fentanyl patch and oxycodone. The hospital nurses noted some confusion on Kenneth\u2019s part and described Kenneth as giddy or happy. Kenneth remained on those opioid analgesics until his death several months later.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b369-10\">McClintock visited Kenneth in the hospital every day until his discharge on August 13, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>J. <em>Albert\u2019s Offer of Assistance</em></p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">On August 3, 2009, a few days after Kenneth\u2019s admission to the hospital, Albert told the hospital staff that he was willing to take Kenneth to Kentucky and that he did not want Kenneth to live in a nursing home. Kenneth\u2019s medical records, however, contained no previous mention of a nursing home. Moreover, the reference to a nursing home conflicts with the prior discharge plan, under which Kenneth was to return to his great-nephew\u2019s home in Maryland.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">On August 6, 2009, a few days after Albert had offered to take Kenneth to Kentucky, Albert met with Kenneth\u2019s oncologist and Kenneth. While he was in Maryland, Albert and his son Andrew also visited the Green farm.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">K. <em>The Limited Power of Attorney in Favor of McClintock</em></p>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">On August 7, 2009, Malamis brought Kenneth\u2019s advance directive to the hospital, and it was inserted into his medical records. Kenneth told the hospital staff that he did not want his family to know that he had a do-not-resuscitate order in effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-9\">While Malamis was at the hospital, Kenneth informed her that he wanted McClintock to perform some tasks for him, and they discussed giving her a power of attorney. Kenneth then spoke by telephone with his attorney, Nelson, who prepared a limited power of attorney in favor of McClintock. Nelson emailed the power of attorney to Malamis, and Malamis presented it to Kenneth, who executed it. The limited power of attorney instructed McClintock that Kenneth wanted his records to go to her home, that he wanted her to close his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>account at First Peoples Federal Credit Union and to deposit the proceeds into his M &amp; T Bank account, and that she should cash some of his savings bonds to pay some of the medical bills that had accumulated.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\">After executing the power of attorney, Kenneth spoke to Oberhaus of Maryland Fuel and confirmed that the instrument appropriately documented his wishes.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">Albert and his son Andrew were at the hospital on that date. Notably, as of that date, the discharge plan remained unchanged\u2014Kenneth was to return to his great-nephew\u2019s house in Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">L. <em>Kenneth\u2019s Announcement that He \u201cHad to Go to Kentucky\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">On McClintock\u2019s regular, daily visit to the hospital on August 9, 2009,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Kenneth told her that he \u201chad to go to Kentucky\u201d with Albert. Otherwise, Kenneth said, he would have to go to a nursing home. Kenneth had never previously said anything to McClintock or to his acquaintances (Malamis, Nelson, or Kiddy) about going to Kentucky after his discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">McClintock offered to allow Kenneth to stay at her house and questioned why he would want to leave Maryland and stay with Stella, whom he disliked.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> During the conversation, Kenneth became distraught and had a breakdown. McClintock did not pursue the issue further.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-9\">M. <em>Stella Green\u2019s Conversation with the Hospital Social Worker</em></p>\n<p id=\"b371-10\">On August 11, 2009, the hospital \u201cstaff\u2019 informed a hospital social worker that Kenneth wanted to go to Kentucky. Ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>cording to Kenneth\u2019s medical records, the social worker had talked to Albert\u2019s wife, Stella, who told her that \u201cthey want to bring him back to the farm where they live and where they grew up.\u201d The circuit court found that the reported statement was \u201cblatantly and deliberately false,\u201d as Kenneth had gone to Kentucky only once in his life\u2014for his brother\u2019s deposition in their litigation over their mother\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">In addition, according to the medical records, Stella reportedly warned the social worker to be careful of McClintock, saying that she was an old co-worker with the reputation of being a \u201cblack widow\u201d and that she was using a power of attorney to keep Kenneth in Maryland.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">N. <em>Kenneth\u2019s Conversation with Kiddy about Going to Kentucky</em></p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">Like McClintock, Kenneth\u2019s neighbor, Kiddy, would also regularly visit Kenneth in the hospital. Kiddy reported that Kenneth was concerned about his farm and his cattle.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-8\">Kiddy thought that Kenneth\u2019s discharge plan was for him to stay with Betty McClintock.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> On a visit on August 13, 2009, however, Kenneth told Kiddy that he was leaving for Kentucky with Albert. When Kiddy questioned the reasons for this sudden change of plans, Kenneth said that he was staying there only for two weeks and would then return to the farm. Albert confirmed that he would bring Kenneth back in two weeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-9\">O. <em>McClintock\u2019s Last Conversation with Kenneth</em></p>\n<p id=\"b372-10\">On that same day, August 13, 2009, McClintock visited Kenneth again and reiterated that he could stay at her house. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>When McClintock had to leave for work, Kenneth asked if she would come back after work. She replied that she would.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">McClintock never saw Kenneth again: later that day, Albert and his son Andrew removed Kenneth from the hospital and took him to Kentucky.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">P. <em>The First Kentucky Power of Attorney</em></p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">The following day, August 14, 2009, Andrew downloaded a power of attorney from the internet. He called a friend and a notary to request that they come to Albert\u2019s home to witness the signing of a power of attorney by his uncle. Kenneth was seated in a hospital bed, with metal rails to prevent him from falling out, when Andrew read the document to him. Kenneth executed the power of attorney, which was in favor of Albert Green.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">Q. <em>Andrew and Albert Take Control of Kenneth\u2019s Accounts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b373-9\"><em>A </em>day or two later, Andrew and Albert returned to Maryland to obtain control of Kenneth\u2019s assets. They went first to the First Peoples credit union, where Albert presented the new power of attorney. There, they learned that Kenneth\u2019s account had been closed and the proceeds disbursed.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b373-10\">Upon receiving that information, Andrew and Albert telephoned Kenneth and told him that McClintock had closed the account and taken his money. Andrew and Albert then went to M &amp; T Bank and obtained Kenneth\u2019s records, using the power of attorney.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In addition, they effected a change of address to Albert\u2019s home in Kentucky.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>While they were in Maryland, Andrew and Albert retrieved some items from Kenneth\u2019s home. Either on this visit or an earlier visit when Kenneth was still in the hospital, Andrew and Albert obtained Kenneth\u2019s lock box and brought it back to Kentucky. Among other items, the box contained Kenneth\u2019s 2003 will.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">A few days later, Albert, using the power of attorney, withdrew $10,162.55 from Kenneth\u2019s M &amp; T bank account. During this same period, Albert and Andrew communicated with Robert Watson, a Maryland attorney, with regard to the Green farm.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">R. <em>The Powers of Attorney</em></p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">On August 23, 2009, Andrew asked two friends and a notary to come to Albert\u2019s house to witness Kenneth\u2019s signing of several additional documents: a statement denying that Kenneth had executed the power of attorney in favor of McClintock; a document indicating his desire to transfer his farm to Albert; and a statement directing the attorney, Nelson, to cease activity on Kenneth\u2019s behalf. The signing was recorded on video at Andrew\u2019s insistence.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">Andrew read the series of documents to Kenneth, who was wearing a hospital gown and lying in a hospital bed in Albert\u2019s house. Albert was present as well, as was an unidentified woman whose voice is heard on the recording.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-9\">While he was signing the third document, Kenneth, who was smiling at the time, said: \u201cWe can handle it. It may not be right, but we can handle it. Rescind any power of attorney to Donald Nelson.... Where to sign ... knows he needs to sign his name.\u201d When Kenneth had finished signing, Andrew said, \u201c[Tjhat will be good enough, I hope.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b374-10\">On that same day, August 23, 2009, Kenneth executed another power of attorney, this one in favor of Andrew. No <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>one made a video recording of the execution of that power of attorney.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">S. <em>Efforts to Cut Off Kenneth\u2019s Access to McClintock</em></p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">Meanwhile, on August 27, 2009, a palliative care visit occurred at Albert\u2019s house. The medical records from the visit reflect that someone\u2014presumably a member of Albert\u2019s family\u2014told the nurse that McClintock was one of Kenneth\u2019s former friends and that she should not be provided any information about Kenneth\u2019s health status.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">On the following day, August 28, 2009, Dr. Ann Colbert visited Kenneth at Albert\u2019s house. During the visit, Stella told the doctor that \u201cthere had been a lot of trouble with a woman named Betty McClintac [sic] who had forged her signature on the [power of attorney].\u201d Stella also told the doctor that McClintock had wanted to place Kenneth in a nursing home and had \u201ctaken quite a bit of his money.\u201d She instructed the doctor that McClintock was \u201cnot to be involved\u201d in Kenneth\u2019s care and that she and Albert had prevented McClintock from coming to visit or being involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">T. <em>The 2009 Will</em></p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">By September 2, 2009, Leslie Richardson, a Kentucky attorney, had drafted a new will for Kenneth. The circuit court found no evidence, however, that Richardson actually knew Kenneth or had ever met him. Instead, Andrew had communicated with Richardson about the will, and Albert and Stella had picked up the draft will from her office. Kenneth was housebound and thus unable to pick up the will.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b375-9\">On September 2, 2009, Andrew asked a few of his friends to come to his father\u2019s home and witness the execution of the new will. While Kenneth was in his hospital bed, Andrew <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>stood beside the bed and read the will. Kenneth \u201cagreed\u201d with the will and executed it, and it was witnessed and notarized. No one made a video recording of the execution of the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">U. <em>The Use of the Power of Attorney to Convey the Farm to Albert</em></p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">On September 3, 2009, the day after the execution of the will, Andrew traveled to Maryland to see Robert Watson, his Maryland attorney. Using his power of attorney, Andrew executed a deed by which he conveyed Kenneth\u2019s farm to Albert. The deed recites that Kenneth is \u201cincapacitated.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">V. <em>Additional Steps to Take Control of Kenneth\u2019s Assets</em></p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">On September 16, 2009, Albert used his power of attorney to open a bank account for himself and Kenneth at Citizens Bank in Kentucky. Despite the power of attorney, Albert established the account as a joint account rather than as a fiduciary account.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-9\">Meanwhile, beginning in mid-August 2009, either Albert or Andrew had communicated with Kenneth\u2019s investment managers and with others who held his assets. By October 1, 2009, Albert and Andrew had succeeded in changing all beneficiary designations on Kenneth\u2019s accounts from McClintock to Albert.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b376-10\">Andrew or Albert sold Kenneth\u2019s cattle during this time period as well. There was no evidence that the proceeds of the cattle sale were deposited into any of Kenneth\u2019s bank accounts.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b377-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>Between October 1, 2009, and December 31, 2009, Albert withdrew $21,338.38 from Kenneth\u2019s account to pay for an addition to Albert\u2019s home. Also, on January 15, 2010, four days before Kenneth\u2019s death, Albert paid Andrew $2,000 from Kenneth\u2019s account as \u201creimbursement for travel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\">W. <em>Additional Efforts to Hold Kenneth Incommunicado</em></p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">Beginning in mid-August 2009, Malamis and Kiddy repeatedly tried to communicate with Kenneth in Kentucky. Kiddy was successful in talking briefly to him on one occasion, but Malamis was unable to reach him. Both Kiddy and Malamis left numerous phone messages that were never returned. Kiddy even traveled to Kentucky to find Kenneth, but was unable to locate Albert\u2019s farm.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">In September 2009, Nelson, the attorney, spoke with Kenneth once as well. Kenneth wanted to make sure that \u201ceverything was okay\u201d with his property and will, and Nelson reassured him that nothing was amiss based on the information that he had at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">Between August 13, 2009, when Albert and Andrew took him to Kentucky, and his death on January 19, 2010, Kenneth had no other contact with anyone in Maryland with whom he had previously been close.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">Throughout that period, Kenneth was homebound. He went outside only once. He left his brother\u2019s house only to be transported to a hospice shortly before he died. He was completely dependent on his brother and sister-in-law for food, shelter, and medical care.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-9\">X. <em>The Orphans\u2019 Court Proceedings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b377-10\">After Kenneth\u2019s death, Malamis and Nelson sought to introduce the 2003 will to probate, while Andrew Green sought to introduce the 2009 will. In his notice of judicial probate, Andrew specifically asserted that Kenneth was domiciled in Allegany County at the time of his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-11\">On June 18, 2010, the orphans\u2019 court held a hearing for the purpose of admitting the 2009 will to probate. At the hearing, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>Andrew asserted that, although Kenneth\u2019s death certificate states that Allegany County was his usual residence, he had established a residence in Kentucky by the time of his death. Thus, Andrew asserted that the estate should be opened in Kentucky rather than Maryland. The orphans\u2019 court, however, unanimously decided that the estate should remain in Maryland. In so doing, the court accepted the 2009 will for probate and appointed Andrew to administer the estate.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">Andrew did not appeal the orphans\u2019 court\u2019s rejection of his argument that Kentucky, and not Maryland, was the appropriate forum for the proceedings to probate Kenneth\u2019s estate. He informed us at oral argument that he has taken no steps to open an estate in Kentucky.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">Y. <em>The Caveat Proceeding</em></p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">On September 9, 2010, McClintock filed a petition to caveat the 2009 will, alleging that the will was procured as a result of fraud, undue influence, or duress imposed by Albert or Albert\u2019s other family members. In response, Andrew petitioned to transfer the caveat proceeding to the circuit court in accordance with Md. Rule 6-434. In his response, Andrew specifically stated that Rule 6-434 empowers the orphans\u2019 court \u201cto transmit issues of fact within its jurisdiction for trial in the Circuit Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">When the orphans\u2019 court transferred its record to the circuit court for the caveat proceeding, the register of wills certified that she had sent \u201cthe original papers as stated on the estate docket in the Estate of Kenneth William Green, late of Allegany County, Maryland.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b378-9\">As previously stated, after a lengthy bench trial, the Circuit Court for Allegany County held that the 2009 will was invalid because it was procured by fraud and undue influence. Andrew filed this timely appeal, in which he not only challenges several rulings at trial, but also whether Maryland had juris<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>diction to adjudicate the validity of the will that he himself submitted to probate.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">\n<em>Questions Presented</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">Andrew presents three questions for our review, which we have rephrased as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-7\">I. Does Maryland lack subject matter jurisdiction over the estate of Kenneth Green?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-8\">II. Did the circuit court err in allowing Kenneth Green\u2019s former attorney, Nelson, to testify regarding confidential communications made by Kenneth Green with regards to the 2003 will?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-9\">III. Was there sufficient evidence for the court to find that the 2009 will was the product of fraud and undue influence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-10\">We find no error and, hence, shall affirm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-11\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b379-12\">I. <em>Maryland Has Jurisdiction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b379-13\">Andrew submitted the 2009 will to probate in Maryland, specifically asserting that Kenneth was domiciled in Allegany County at the time of his death. As a consequence, a Maryland probate court vested Andrew with the status of Kenneth\u2019s personal representative. As such, Andrew gained a number of procedural advantages in the dispute with McClintock, including the right to assert Kenneth\u2019s attorney-client privilege and the ability to require McClintock to bear the burden of proof in the caveat proceeding. Andrew himself petitioned to transmit the caveat proceeding to the circuit court, asserting, in support of his petition, that Md. Rule 6-434 empowered the orphans\u2019 court to transmit contested issues of fact \u201cwithin its jurisdiction.\u201d Nonetheless, now that the circuit court has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>ruled against him in that dispute, Andrew raises a preliminary issue that he either chose not to raise or neglected to raise in the circuit court\u2014whether Maryland may exercise subject matter jurisdiction over Kenneth\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">It is tempting to hold that Andrew has either waived that issue (because of his neglect) or is equitably estopped from raising it (because of his gamesmanship). A party, however, cannot waive an objection to a court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction. <em>See, e.g., State v. Walls, </em>90 Md.App. 300, 305, 600 A.2d 1165 (1992). Moreover, just as parties are unable to agree to confer subject matter jurisdiction upon a court <em>(Stewart v. State, </em>287 Md. 524, 527, 413 A.2d 1337 (1980); <em>Walls, </em>90 Md.App. at 305, 600 A.2d 1165), so too are they unable to create subject matter jurisdiction by estoppel. <em>See, e.g., StreetEasy, Inc. v. Chertok, </em>752 F.3d 298, 306 (2d Cir.2014) (citing <em>Williams v. United States, </em>947 F.2d 37, 39 (2d Cir.1991)). Indeed, because a court has no power to decide a dispute unless it has subject matter jurisdiction, a party can question the existence of subject matter jurisdiction at any time\u2014even on an appeal in a case in which the existence of jurisdiction was neither raised nor decided below. <em>Harris v. Simmons, </em>110 Md.App. 95, 113, 676 A.2d 944 (1996); <em>Walls, </em>90 Md.App. at 305, 600 A.2d 1165. Consequently, we must consider Andrew\u2019s challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">Although Andrew frames his challenge in terms of subject matter jurisdiction, he does not explain why, in his view, the subject matter of this dispute falls outside the scope of what the orphans\u2019 court and circuit court were empowered to decide. He certainly does not raise a typical objection to subject matter jurisdiction, such as an objection that a court has decided a type of case that it is not empowered to decide <em>(e.g., </em>an objection that a circuit court decided a replevin action, which lies within the exclusive original jurisdiction of the district court). Md. Code (2013 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 4-401(2) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article. Nor does he complain that the court purported to exercise a power that has not been conferred upon it <em>(e.g., </em>a complaint that a district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>attempted to exercise general equity jurisdiction, which, by statute, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 4-402(a), it does not have). In fact, in none of his arguments about subject matter jurisdiction does Andrew ever cite or discuss the statutory basis for probate jurisdiction in Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">The basis for that jurisdiction is found in title 2, subtitle 1, of the Estates and Trusts Article. Under Md. Code (1974, 2011 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 2-102(a) of the Estates and Trusts Article, the orphans\u2019 court \u201cmay conduct judicial probate, direct the conduct of a personal representative, and pass orders which may be required in the course of the administration of an estate of a decedent.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Furthermore, under Md. Code (1974, 2011 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 2-105(b) of the Estates and Trusts Article, the orphans\u2019 court \u201cshall\u201d transmit issues of fact to \u201ca court of law\u201d upon \u201cthe request of an interested party\u201d \u201cmade before the [orphans\u2019 court] has determined the issue of fact.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The courts in this case proceeded in precise accordance with these jurisdictional grants: the orphans\u2019 court conducted judicial probate proceedings (in response, in part, to the notice of judicial probate that Andrew had filed); the probate proceedings included the caveat petition that McClintock had filed; and at McClintock\u2019s request (and with Andrew\u2019s consent), the orphans\u2019 court transmitted the caveat case to the circuit court, a court of law, for a determination of the relevant factual issues. In these circumstances, it is not immediately clear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>how the Maryland courts have exceeded their subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">Without citation to any authority, however, Andrew argues that in a probate ease a Maryland court has subject matter jurisdiction only if the decedent was domiciled in Maryland at the time of his or her death. Andrew\u2019s argument is difficult to reconcile with Md. Code (1974, 2011 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 5-103(a) of the Estates and Trusts Article, which specifically recognizes that a Maryland court can probate the estate of a person who was domiciled elsewhere at the time of his or her death, at least as long as the decedent owned property in Maryland at that time:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-5\">The venue for administrative or judicial probate is in the county in which the decedent had his domicile at the time of his death, or, <em>if the decedent was not domiciled in Maryland, </em>the county in which the petitioner believes the largest part in value of the property of the decedent in Maryland was located at the time of his death.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-6\"><em>Accord Wright v. Nugent, </em>23 Md.App. 337, 353, 328 A.2d 362 (1974), <em>aff'd, </em>275 Md. 290, 338 A.2d 898 (1975) (per curiam) (holding that Talbot County was the proper venue for administrative probate of the estate of a decedent who was domiciled in the District of Columbia at the time of his death, because the petitioner for probate believed that the decedent\u2019s property in Talbot County represented the largest part in value of his property located in Maryland); <em>see also </em>Restatement (Second) of Conflicts of Law \u00a7 314 cmt. b (1971) (stating that, as a general rule, \u201c[a]ny state has jurisdiction to admit a will to probate or to appoint an executor or administrator for a decedent\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">In other words, if the decedent was domiciled in a particular county at the time of death <em>or </em>if the decedent had more property in that county than anywhere else in the State (in the belief of the person who petitions for probate), the orphans\u2019 court for that county is the proper venue for probate proceedings. But because a court can be a proper venue only if it has jurisdiction, jurisdiction cannot depend solely on whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>decedent was domiciled in Maryland at the time of his or her death: the court may also have jurisdiction if the decedent simply had property in Maryland at the time of death. <em>See Kortobi v. Kass, </em>182 Md.App. 424, 431, 957 A.2d 1128 (2008), <em>aff'd, </em>410 Md. 168, 978 A.2d 247 (2009) (stating that the State may subject all property within its borders to its laws).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">Both parties urge us to decide where Kenneth was domiciled at the time of his death. The issue of domicile, however, requires a fact-intensive inquiry into Kenneth\u2019s intentions <em>(see Blount v. Boston, </em>351 Md. 360, 367-73, 718 A.2d 1111 (1998)), which the circuit court was not asked to conduct, and which it would be inappropriate for an appellate court to conduct in the first instance. <em>Cf. Von Dunser v. Aronoff, </em>915 F.2d 1071, 1072-76 (6th Cir.1990) (where party challenged subject matter jurisdiction for first time on appeal by raising issue of domicile, and thus of diversity of citizenship, court remanded for factual determination regarding domicile).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">Furthermore, although it is fairly clear that Kenneth owned at least some property in Allegany County at the time of his death,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> we need not decide whether Maryland had jurisdiction over his estate on that ground: the orphans\u2019 court rejected Andrew\u2019s challenge to its jurisdiction at the outset of the case, and Andrew failed to exercise his right to appeal that ruling. Hence, the orphans\u2019 court\u2019s ruling operates as collateral estoppel on the issue of jurisdiction. <em>Tucker v. Tucker, </em>35 Md.App. 710, 712-15, 373 A.2d 16 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">In <em>Tucker, </em>35 Md.App. at 711, 373 A.2d 16, Mr. Tucker moved to revise a divorce decree that obligated him to pay his ex-wife\u2019s medical expenses and those of their minor children. In support of his motion, Mr. Tucker contended that the court had lacked jurisdiction to enter that portion of its decree. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>The circuit court disagreed, and Mr. Tucker failed to appeal\u2014 nor, apparently, did he pay the expenses. <em>Id. </em>Instead, in a subsequent proceeding, in which his ex-wife sought to have him held in contempt, he attempted to reassert his jurisdictional argument. <em>Id. </em>The circuit court declined to entertain the argument, and this Court affirmed, stating that \u201cprinciples of res judicata apply to a jurisdictional question when that question has actually been raised, litigated and determined in favor of jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 713, 373 A.2d 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">These same principles apply in this case. When the orphans\u2019 court rejected his jurisdictional challenge to a Maryland court\u2019s power to administer Kenneth\u2019s estate, Andrew had the right to appeal either to this Court<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> or to the circuit court,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> because the ruling was a \u201cfinal judgment\u201d in the context of the probate proceedings. <em>Wright v. Nugent, </em>23 Md.App. at 357-58, 328 A.2d 362 (a party may appeal from the orphans\u2019 court\u2019s determination that it has jurisdiction over an estate and that it may admit a will to probate, because the determination is a \u201cfinal judgment\u201d for purposes of probate proceedings); <em>see also Pattison v. Firor, </em>146 Md. 243, 249, 126 A. 109 (1924) (a party may appeal from the orphans\u2019 court\u2019s denial of a petition contending that the decedent had not resided in the jurisdiction and thus that the court should not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>issue letters testamentary or of administration).<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\"> Indeed, Andrew was not only permitted to appeal the ruling on jurisdiction, but he was required to appeal if he continued to dispute the court\u2019s power to administer the estate. Once a probate court has rebuffed a challenge to its jurisdiction, as it did here, the court (and interested parties) are entitled to act in reliance upon that decision in disbursing estate assets to creditors, professionals, and (in some estates) perhaps even some beneficiaries. Thus, if a party, like Andrew, could challenge the court\u2019s jurisdiction after it had authorized those sorts of disbursements, the party could create great uncertainty in estate administration by threatening to invalidate the court\u2019s actions long after they had occurred. It follows that if an orphans\u2019 court rejects a party\u2019s challenge to its jurisdiction, the party must immediately exercise its right to appeal, and must prevail on its appeal, or else he or she will be barred from raising future challenges to the court\u2019s jurisdiction.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">Andrew may have failed to appeal the orphans\u2019 court\u2019s ruling because he was unaware of his appellate rights. Or he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>may have failed to appeal because he was willing to forgo his rights in light of the court\u2019s acceptance of what was, in effect, his alternative argument, that he should be the personal representative if the estate were to be administered in Maryland. In either case, however, collateral estoppel bars him from relitigating the issue of jurisdiction after it had been \u201craised, litigated and determined\u201d against him in a final, appealable judgment, from which he had the right to appeal <em>(Wright v. Nugent, </em>23 Md.App. at 357-58, 328 A.2d 362), but from which he failed to appeal. <em>Tucker, </em>35 Md.App. at 713, 373 A.2d 16. Accordingly, we reject Andrew\u2019s attack on the circuit court\u2019s exercise of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">II. <em>The Circuit Court Did Not Commit Prejudicial Error in Permitting Kenneth\u2019s Attorney to Testify About Kenneth\u2019s Estate Plan </em>t</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">Andrew argues that the circuit court erred when it allowed Kenneth\u2019s attorney, Nelson, to testify about communications with Kenneth about his estate planning and the preparation of the 2003 will and about a communication with Kenneth after Albert and Andrew had taken him to Kentucky. Andrew complains that the court violated Kenneth\u2019s attorney-client privilege, which Andrew, as personal representative, was entitled to assert. We see no error, and certainly no prejudicial error.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">Kenneth undoubtedly had an attorney-client relationship with Nelson, at least in connection with the 2003 will and the limited power of attorney that he drafted for Kenneth while he was hospitalized in Maryland in August 2009. Hence, the attorney-client privilege potentially applies at least to some communications between Kenneth and Nelson. <em>See, e.g., Zook v. Pesce, </em>438 Md. 232, 240-42, 91 A.3d 1114 (2014); <em>Greenberg v. State, </em>421 Md. 396, 408-09, 26 A.3d 955 (2011); <em>El. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co. v. Forma-Pack, Inc., </em>351 Md. 396, 414-15, 718 A.2d 1129 (1998); <em>Harrison v. State, </em>276 Md. 122, 134-35, 345 A.2d 830 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>Maryland has adopted Wigmore\u2019s definition of the attorney-client privilege:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-4\">(1) Where legal advice of [any] kind is sought, (2) from a professional legal adviser in his capacity as such, (3) the communications relating to that purpose, (4) made in confidence, (5) by the client, (6) are at his insistence permanently protected, (7) from disclosure by himself or by the legal adviser, (8) except the protection [may] be waived.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-5\"><em>See, e.g., Harrison, </em>276 Md. at 135, 345 A.2d 830 (quoting 8 John H. Wigmore, Wigmore on Evidence \u00a7 2922, at 554 (McNaughton rev. ed. 1961)); <em>accord Greenberg, </em>421 Md. at 409, 26 A.3d 955; <em>Forma-Pack, </em>351 Md. at 415, 718 A.2d 1129.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">Nonetheless, the Court of Appeals has cautioned that, \u201cbecause the application of the attorney-client privilege withholds relevant information from the fact finder, the privilege contains some limitations and should be narrowly construed.\u201d <em>Forma-Pack, </em>351 Md. at 415, 718 A.2d 1129.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">Within its proper bounds, the attorney-client privilege will survive the client\u2019s death. <em>See Zook, </em>438 Md. at 240-42, 91 A.3d 1114; <em>Trupp v. Wolff, </em>24 Md.App. 588, 609, 335 A.2d 171 (1975). Ordinarily, therefore, an attorney may not disclose a client\u2019s confidential communications even after the client dies. <em>Trupp, </em>24 Md.App. at 609, 335 A.2d 171. As the Supreme Court has explained, \u201cKnowing that communications will remain confidential even after death encourages the client to communicate fully and frankly with counsel\u201d without concern about \u201creputation, civil liability, or possible harm to friends and family.\u201d <em>Swidler &amp; Berlin v. United States, </em>524 U.S. 399, 407, 118 S.Ct. 2081, 141 L.Ed.2d 379 (1998); <em>accord Zook, </em>438 Md. at 242, 91 A.3d 1114.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">But despite the general rule of continued confidentiality after death, Maryland recognizes a \u201ctestamentary exception\u201d to the attorney-client privilege. That exception establishes that, \u201cin a dispute between putative heirs or devisees under a will or trust, the attorney-client privilege does not bar admission of testimony and evidence regarding communication between the decedent and any attorneys involved in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>creation of the instrument, provided that evidence or testimony tends to help clarify the donative intent of the decedent.\u201d <em>Zook, </em>438 Md. at 242, 91 A.3d 1114; <em>see Benzinger v. Hemler, </em>134 Md. 581, 586, 107 A. 355 (1919).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">Andrew concedes the existence of the testamentary exception, but contends that it applies only to the will that is being <em>contested\u2014i.e., </em>in this case, to the 2009 will. Hence, he contends that the circuit court erred in permitting Nelson to testify about Kenneth\u2019s intentions in regard to his earlier will and estate plan. In <em>Zook, </em>however, the Court of Appeals rejected a similar contention. <em>Zook, </em>438 Md. at 251, 91 A.3d 1114.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">In that case, the beneficiary of a trust alleged that her sister had exercised undue influence over their father, the settlor, in inducing him to revise the trust shortly before his death. <em>Zook, </em>438 Md. at 236-39, 91 A.3d 1114. Because a change in the father\u2019s estate plan could constitute proof of undue influence <em>(see Moore v. Smith, </em>321 Md. 347, 353, 582 A.2d 1237 (1990)), the beneficiary sought to discover and to introduce the earlier trust. <em>Zook, </em>438 Md. at 239-40, 91 A.3d 1114. The Court of Appeals held that it was error (though not reversible error in the circumstances of that case) for the circuit court to bar the discovery and introduction of the earlier trust. <em>Id., </em>at 251, 91 A.3d 1114. In view of the allegations of undue influence in this case, therefore, it might well have been error for the circuit court <em>not </em>to have permitted testimony about Kenneth\u2019s intentions before he radically altered his estate plan in adopting the 2009 will. <em>See id.; accord In re Everett\u2019s Will, </em>105 Vt. 291, 166 A. 827, 835 (1933) (holding that \u201cevidence of previous wills, executed or unexecuted, was admissible\u201d in determining whether there was undue influence in procuring a later will).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">In any event, even if the circuit court erred in allowing Nelson\u2019s testimony about the 2003 will, we would still affirm, because the testimony was cumulative and thus harmless. <em>See Zook, </em>438 Md. at 251, 91 A.3d 1114 (to obtain reversal, an appellant \u201cmust not only show error but must demonstrate that the error was prejudicial\u201d). In his testimony concerning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>the 2003 will, Nelson focused on three matters: (1) Kenneth\u2019s intention to give his estate to McClintock; (2) his antipathy toward his sister-in-law, Stella; and (3) his approval of the option in favor of Maryland Fuel. Yet, other witnesses, including McClintock, Kiddy, Malamis, and Oberhaus, gave similar testimony concerning these same matters. For instance, Malamis testified that, when Kenneth executed the will at an M &amp; T Bank branch office in 2003, he told her and a bank employee why he wanted to give his estate to McClintock and explained his disdain for Stella. Similarly, Oberhaus testified that Kenneth \u201cwas agreeable\u201d to the option in favor of Maryland Fuel. Indeed, the 2003 will itself evidences Kenneth\u2019s intention to give his estate to McClintock and to grant the option.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">As a separate and final matter, while Andrew also objected to Nelson\u2019s testimony about a September 2009 conversation in which Kenneth asked him whether \u201ceverything is still okay\u201d with his property and his will, we think that the testimony also falls well within the testamentary exception. In particular, the testimony \u201chelps to clarify the donative intent of the decedent,\u201d <em>Zook, </em>438 Md. at 244, 91 A.3d 1114 as it suggests that Kenneth had no idea at the time that he had changed his will (or that Andrew had used a power of attorney to convey the farm to Albert). The circuit court, therefore, did not err in permitting Nelson to testify about that conversation.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">III. <em>The Record Contains Sufficient Evidence to Support the Circuit Court\u2019s Findings of Fraud and Undue Influence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">In his final challenge, Andrew argues that there was insufficient evidence to support a finding of fraud or undue influence. In view of the abundance of evidence that Andrew and Albert employed false pretenses to abduct their dying relative from Maryland and then held him, incommunicado, in Kentucky, where he was housebound, highly medicated, and completely dependent on them for sustenance and support, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">In examining Andrew\u2019s argument, we must employ two different standards of review. First, we must evaluate wheth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>er the record contains sufficient evidence to support the circuit court\u2019s factual findings. Then, we must evaluate whether those factual findings support the conclusion that the will was the product of fraud or undue influence.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">We review the circuit court\u2019s factfinding under the clearly-erroneous standard, under which the findings will not be overturned unless there is no competent and material evidence to support them. <em>See, e.g., L.W. Wolfe Enters., </em>165 Md.App. at 343, 885 A.2d 826.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">A. <em>Undue Influence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">We shall first address the sufficiency of the evidence to support the circuit court\u2019s conclusion regarding undue influence.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">The Court of Appeals has stated that, \u201c \u2018[generally, undue influence amounts to physical or moral coercion that forces a testator to follow another\u2019s judgment instead of his own.\u2019 \u201d <em>Zook, </em>438 Md. at 248, 91 A.3d 1114 (quoting <em>Moore, </em>321 Md. at 353, 582 A.2d 1237). To be \u201cundue,\u201d the influence must be \u201c \u2018unlawful,\u2019 \u201d \u201c \u2018on account of the manner and motive of its exertion, and must be exerted to such a degree as to amount to force or coercion, destroying free agency.\u2019 \u201d <em>Zook, </em>438 Md. at 248, 91 A.3d 1114 (quoting <em>Koppal v. Soules, </em>189 Md. 346, 351, 56 A.2d 48 (1947)); <em>accord Moore, </em>321 Md. at 353, 582 A.2d 1237 (quoting <em>Nalley v. Nalley, </em>253 Md. 197, 202, 251 A.2d 849 (1969)). The caveator bears the \u201cheavy\u201d burden of establishing undue influence <em>(Zook, </em>438 Md. at 248, 91 A.3d 1114), but \u201cthe quantum of proof necessary to establish undue influence varies according to the susceptibility of the testator.\u201d <em>Moore, </em>321 Md. at 360, 582 A.2d 1237.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-9\">Although the Court of Appeals has \u201cnot laid down a test to determine the existence of undue influence with mathematical accuracy,\u201d <em>Moore, </em>321 Md. at 353, 582 A.2d 1237, it \u201chas recognized the following list of elements characteristic of undue influence\u201d <em>(Zook, </em>438 Md. at 248, 91 A.3d 1114):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-10\">1. [t]he benefactor and beneficiary are involved in a relationship of confidence and trust;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>2. [t]he will contains substantial benefit to the beneficiary;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-5\">3. [t]he beneficiary caused or assisted in effecting execution of will;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-6\">4. [tjhere was an opportunity to exert influence;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-7\">5. [tjhe will contains an unnatural disposition;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-8\">6. [tjhe bequests constitute a change from a former will; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-9\">7. [tjhe testator was highly susceptible to the undue influence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b391-10\"><em>Id., </em>at 248, 91 A.3d 1114; <em>Moore, </em>321 Md. at 353, 582 A.2d 1237.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-11\">A caveator need not prove the presence of all seven of these factors, <em>Orwick v. Moldawer, </em>150 Md.App. 528, 534, 822 A.2d 506 (2003), but the first and seventh factors (relationship of confidence and trust, and high susceptibility to undue influence) do appear to be necessary conditions for a finding of undue influence. <em>See id. </em>at 533-34, 822 A.2d 506; <em>see Upman v. Clarke, </em>359 Md. 32, 49, 753 A.2d 4 (2000) (affirming a finding of no undue influence where the evidence showed no abuse of a confidential relationship); <em>Anderson v. Meadowcroft, </em>339 Md. 218, 229, 661 A.2d 726 (1995) (affirming the dismissal of a complaint alleging undue influence where the pleading did not contain sufficient allegations of the testator\u2019s high susceptibility to influence).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-12\">Nearly all of the factors are present in this case, including the essential first and seventh factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-13\">As for the first factor, a confidential relationship exists when \u201c \u2018two persons stand in such a relation to each other that one must necessarily repose trust and confidence in the good faith and integrity of the other.\u2019 \u201d <em>Upman, </em>359 Md. at 42, 753 A.2d 4 (quoting <em>Green v. Michael, </em>183 Md. 76, 84, 36 A.2d 923 (1944)). \u201c[D]ependence\u201d is \u201cthe key factor\u201d in the existence of a confidential relationship. <em>Id. </em>at 41, 753 A.2d 4 (citing <em>Green, </em>183 Md. at 84, 36 A.2d 923).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-14\">Here, there is no question that Albert and Kenneth were in a relationship of trust and confidence and thus that the crucial first factor is satisfied. After Albert and Andrew <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>took Kenneth from the hospital in Maryland to Albert\u2019s house in Kentucky, he was in what the circuit court found to be a \u201cseverely weakened condition\u201d\u2014dying of cancer that had metastasized through his body, on \u201copiates for pain,\u201d \u201chouse bound\u201d [sic], and \u201ctotally dependent upon his brother and Stella for food, personal hygiene and a roof over his head.\u201d Kenneth was also dependent on his brother and nephew to manage his finances, having given them the powers of attorney that they used to convey his farm to Albert (for no consideration), sell his cattle, and liquidate his accounts. <em>See Moore, </em>321 Md. at 358, 582 A.2d 1237 (\u201c[i]n light of the intimate nature of [the testator\u2019s] physical limitations and reliance on [the defendant] to attend his personal and physical needs, as well as [the testator\u2019s] financial affairs, the development of a confidential relationship was inevitable\u201d). Even Andrew concedes that there was a relationship of trust between the brothers.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">The analysis is similar for the crucial seventh factor (high susceptibility to influence). Kenneth\u2019s advanced illness, the pain medications that he took, his almost-total immobility, and his abject dependence on Albert and his family \u201ccreated a perfect setting over which someone could take advantage.\u201d <em>Moore, </em>321 Md. at 357, 582 A.2d 1237. Worse yet, Albert and his family members cut off Kenneth\u2019s ability to communicate with his friends and acquaintances in Maryland, including McClintock, thereby further isolating him and rendering him even more susceptible to influence. Hence, not only was this second factor clearly satisfied, but Kenneth\u2019s confirmed susceptibility has the effect of diminishing the \u201cquantum of proof\u2019 that McClintock would otherwise have to establish. <em>Id. </em>at 360, 582 A.2d 1237.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">The second and third factors are satisfied as well. Regarding the second factor, the will contains substantial benefits for Albert because it grants him the entire estate. Regarding the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>third, Albert assisted in executing the will by putting Andrew in contact with the lawyer who drafted it, picking up the will from the lawyer, and having Andrew arrange for witnesses and a notary to be present at the signing of the will. <em>See Moore, </em>321 Md. at 359, 582 A.2d 1237 (finding undue influence in part because the caveatee arranged for the attorney who prepared the new will).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">For the fourth factor, Albert had the opportunity to exert influence because Kenneth was secluded in Kentucky, immobilized in a hospital bed, housebound in Albert\u2019s and Stella\u2019s home, and highly medicated. In fact, the court\u2019s findings imply that Albert did not merely have the opportunity to exert influence, but that he did exert it\u2014by, for example, spiriting Kenneth away to Kentucky on the false pretense that he would return in two weeks, having his son use a power of attorney to convey Kenneth\u2019s farm to him for no consideration, moving Kenneth\u2019s assets into a joint account of which he was the co-owner, and using Kenneth\u2019s funds to construct an addition on his house. The fourth factor also weighs in favor of a finding of undue influence.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">The fifth factor tends to weigh against a finding of undue influence, because the 2009 will contains a \u201cnatural\u201d disposition in the sense that it gives Kenneth\u2019s property to a family member. <em>See Rowe v. Rowe, </em>124 Md.App. 89, 94, 720 A.2d 1225 (1998) (\u201c[i]n Maryland, there exists a common law presumption against disinheritance of ... next of kin\u201d). Nonetheless, given Kenneth\u2019s antipathy toward Albert\u2019s wife, his struggle to win the farm from his brother in the litigation over their mother\u2019s estate, his continued frustration about that struggle (as reported to his neighbor, Kiddy), his reported <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>statement to Albert in as late as May 2009 that Albert would not inherit the farm, and his long-term, stable, caring, and supportive relationship with McClintock, a sudden decision to divest McClintock and to give his entire estate to his brother could be construed as unusual. Consequently, this factor is neutral at best; it is certainly not dispositive in Andrew's favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">Finally, for the sixth and last factor, the will is completely changed from the 2003 will, which gave McClintock the entirety of the estate. <em>See Moore, </em>321 Md. at 358, 582 A.2d 1237 (affirming a finding of undue influence in part because of an abrupt change in a longstanding plan). While Andrew attacks the legitimacy of the earlier will, that issue was not before the circuit court, nor is it before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">In summary, based on the circuit court\u2019s central findings, which have not been shown to be clearly erroneous, a reasonable factfinder, viewing the facts in the light most favorable to McClintock, could conclude that the will resulted from the exertion of undue influence by Albert and his family members. Accordingly, we reject Andrew\u2019s challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence supporting that conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">B. <em>Fraud</em></p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">Lastly, we turn to the issue of fraud, which, in a will contest, a caveator is required to prove only by a preponderance of the evidence, and not by the higher standard of clear and convincing evidence that applies to common-law fraud. <em>See Krouse v. Krouse, </em>94 Md.App. 369, 378, 617 A.2d 1098 (1993) (citing <em>Griffith v. Diffenderffer, </em>50 Md. 466, 489 (1879)).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-9\">Andrew argues that, in a will contests, fraud occurs only when someone deceives the testator about the will\u2019s provisions or when the testator does not know that he or she is signing a will (as opposed to some other kind of document). Thus, he argues that fraud in the inducement will not suffice to invalidate a will. His position is inconsistent with longstanding principles of Maryland law.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-10\">In <em>Tufts v. Poore, </em>219 Md. 1, 15, 147 A.2d 717 (1959), the Court of Appeals affirmed a jury verdict that invalidated a will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>on grounds of fraud in the inducement. In that case, the testator, Mrs. Poore, had originally executed a will that gave her 14-acre estate to her daughter, Nancy Poore Tufts, for life, with the remainder to her granddaughter, Suzanne Poore. <em>See id. </em>at 6, 147 A.2d 717. The daughter, Tufts, knew of her mother\u2019s plans and was embarrassed that she would receive the estate only for her life (evidently because her family members might regard it as a kind of slight). <em>See id. </em>at 9, 147 A.2d 717. Consequently, Tufts promised her mother that if she changed her will to give Tufts the estate in fee simple, Tufts would simultaneously execute a will by which she would convey her interest, at death, to the granddaughter Suzanne. <em>See id. </em>(she \u201cwould simultaneously execute and continue in existence of will of her own which would accomplish substantially the same disposition of her mother\u2019s estate\u201d). Tufts \u201cmade the promise with a present intention not to perform the agreement,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 10, 147 A.2d 717, which amounts to fraud in the inducement. <em>Id. </em>at 10-11, 147 A.2d 717. In fact, while Tufts did execute a will, she did not deliver it to the bank with her mother\u2019s will, but retained possession of it and later destroyed it <em>(id. </em>at 9, 147 A.2d 717), never telling her mother \u201cthat the will was destroyed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 8, 147 A.2d 717. On these facts, the Court of Appeals held that the circuit court properly submitted the issue of fraud to the jury. <em>Id. </em>at 11, 12, 147 A.2d 717.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">In reaching that decision, <em>Tufts </em>cited and quoted <em>Davis v. Calvert, 5 </em>Gill &amp; J. 269 (1883). In that case, the Court of Appeals reversed the verdict in a caveat proceeding because the court had excluded evidence that the defendants had deceived the testator into believing that he had fathered the children for whom he provided in the will. It would appear, therefore, that the doctrine of fraudulent inducement is not a recent development in will contests in Maryland.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">Under <em>Tufts </em>and <em>Davis, </em>McClintock generated sufficient evidence of fraud. Based on the trial court\u2019s findings, Andrew <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>and Albert falsely asserted that McClintock stole Kenneth\u2019s money in order to deceive Kenneth and to make him change his will and disinherit McClintock. While Andrew and Albert deny that those statements were false, we defer to the judgment of the trial judge on the credibility of witnesses. <em>Morris v. State, </em>153 Md.App. 480, 489, 837 A.2d 248 (2003). The trial judge chose to believe McClintock when she stated that she closed Kenneth\u2019s bank account and sold off his assets only at his behest. Thus, because the judge found Andrew\u2019s and Albert\u2019s statement to be false, and because it was clearly aimed at turning Kenneth against McClintock, it is sufficient to support a finding of fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">In summary, we hold that the Maryland courts have subject matter jurisdiction over Kenneth\u2019s estate; that the circuit did not err in admitting Nelson\u2019s testimony concerning Kenneth\u2019s intentions in regard to his 2003 will or, in the alternative, that any error was harmless because the testimony was cumulative; that the circuit court did not err in admitting Nelson\u2019s testimony concerning his September 2009 testimony with Kenneth; and that the circuit court was not clearly erroneous in finding the 2009 will to be invalid on grounds of fraud and undue influence. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment below.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR ALLEGANY COUNTY AFFIRMED.

In its findings of fact, the circuit court observed that Stella did not testify at the trial. Nor did Albert.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b372-12\">. In its findings of fact, the circuit court incorrectly stated that, in Kiddy's understanding, the discharge plan was for Kenneth to return to the home of his great-nephew, Adam Johnson.

This approach serves \u201cthe very purpose of the final judgment rule, which is to avoid piecemeal appeals that create inefficiencies in both the appellate and trial courts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In probate proceedings, however, the interests of efficiency are often better served by permitting some immediate appeals, and thus a modified final judgment rule applies. <em>See Schlossberg v. Schlossberg, </em>275 Md. 600, 612, 343 A.2d 234 (1975) (explaining that the appealable final judgments of an orphans\u2019 court are \"those judgments, orders, decisions, etc. which, in caveat proceedings, finally determine the proper parties, the issues to be tried and the sending of those issues to a court of law\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b392-6\">.

While Andrew challenges the court\u2019s findings that Kenneth was cut off from his Maryland contacts and about the medications he took, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>cannot say that the court was clearly erroneous. Andrew does not dispute that Kenneth received a total of only two phone calls over the course of five months from friends who had previously visited him in the hospital nearly every day. Nor can Andrew dispute the evidence that at least two of these people tried to reach him on multiple occasions. Furthermore, even though Andrew is correct that Kenneth was on only two opiates (fentanyl and oxycodone), instead of three (fentanyl, oxycodone, and morphine), it does not change the fact that he was highly medicated and highly susceptible to influence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b395-7\">. Consistent with this long lineage, the Maryland Civil Pattern Jury Instructions recognize fraudulent inducement as a ground for invalidat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>ing a will. MPJI-Cv 29:5 (\"[f]raud means that a false representation was made to the maker of the will by another person who knew the representation was false and who made the representation with an intent of deceiving the maker\u201d); <em>see also Krouse v. Krouse, </em>94 Md.App. 369, 375-78, 617 A.2d 1098 (1993) (affirming a finding of fraud in a case in which the court employed the pattern jury instruction concerning fraudulent inducement as a ground for invalidating a will); Restatement (Second) of Property, Donative Transfers, \u00a7 34.7 cmt. c (1992) (a fraudulent transfer may occur if a person makes \"fraudulent representations [that] cause the donor not to make a donative transfer that the donor would otherwise have made and instead makes the donative transfer to someone else\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
