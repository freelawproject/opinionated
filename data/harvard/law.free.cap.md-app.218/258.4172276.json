(\u201cRaven\u201d). The finding of child abuse stemmed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>from appellant\u2019s repeatedly making sexual abuse allegations against Raven\u2019s father and taking the child to multiple sexual abuse examinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\">Appellant appealed the Department\u2019s finding to the Office of Administrative Hearings (\u201cOAH\u201d) in January 2011, and an administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) affirmed the Department\u2019s finding in October 2011. Appellant then sought judicial review of the ALJ\u2019s determination in the Circuit Court for Washington County, which affirmed the ALJ\u2019s decision on May 2, 2013. Appellant filed a timely appeal to this Court on May 30, 2013, and presents four questions for our review, which we have rephrased and consolidated into three:<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-5\">1. Did the record contain competent, material, and substantial evidence sufficient to support the ALJ\u2019s decision?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-6\">2. Did the ALJ err by admitting evidence that violated the privilege laws of Maryland and Pennsylvania?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-7\">3. Did the ALJ violate the immunity provisions of the Family Law and Courts and Judicial Proceedings Articles?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b283-8\">For the reasons set forth below, we answer question one in the affirmative, and conclude that questions two and three have not been preserved for our review. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"ABb\">\n<em>Family Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">On May 6, 2005, Raven was born to appellant and her then-husband John H. Each parent had substance abuse problems and accused the other of domestic violence. Appellant also accused Mr. H. of sexually abusing her. On August 2, 2006, appellant and Mr. H. separated after nineteen years of marriage, and they legally divorced on February 25, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">After her parents\u2019 divorce, Raven lived with appellant, who had primary physical custody, and had unsupervised visitation with her father three weekends per month and one weeknight per week. Mr. H. remarried, as did appellant. Appellant\u2019s second husband, Michael M., died of a heart attack in December 2009. Appellant now lives with a live-in partner.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">\n<em>Original Abuse Allegations &amp; Investigations</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">During the approximately three-and-a-half year period from June 2007 to November 2010, appellant took Raven to the hospital nine times for physical examinations related to sexual abuse allegations. The examinations shared two common features: first, the evaluations occurred after Raven made sexual abuse allegations following visitation at her father\u2019s home; second, Raven presented with physical symptoms immediately prior to each examination.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> None of these examinations, however, confirmed that Raven had been sexually abused.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">At first, Raven alleged that her father or step-brother had molested her or penetrated her with small objects, and later described assaults involving a needle, cream, or the family\u2019s pets. Raven generally made these accusations in the presence of her mother. The allegation Raven made on June 28, 2010 typified the nature of the child\u2019s claims. On that day, Raven informed her mother and her babysitter that her father \u201cpoked me with a needle in my front bottom.\u201d Raven later <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>told a nurse that she felt \u201csad [because] of how I got hurt,\u201d and that the needle was \u201cblue [with] 5 green stripes.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">Raven displayed very similar physical symptoms at the time of each appointment, including genital redness and swelling, and occasionally vaginal discharge, which indicated a urinary tract infection.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> At the second forensic examination, on February 21, 2008, Dr. Ruth Ann Dwyer diagnosed Raven with \u201cvulvitis-normal variant in pre-pubertal female,\u201d and the terms \u201cvulvitis\u201d and \u201cvaginitis\u201d were often used to described the irritation experienced by Raven.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">Both the irritation and the infections observed in Raven are common in children her age, and can often be attributed to poor hygiene. At the February 2008 visit, Dr. Dwyer noted toilet paper on Raven\u2019s genitals, an indication of poor hygiene, and discussed \u201croutine good hygiene care\u201d with appellant. On more than one occasion, appellant received education about how to prevent the irritation of Raven\u2019s genitals, which included the child\u2019s avoiding bubble baths and wearing underwear overnight.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">Dr. Dwyer also reported in Raven\u2019s medical chart that a \u201cnormal exam does not exclude a history of sexual abuse,\u201d and personally explained to appellant that abuse could not be ruled-out. As indicated above, however, no examination revealed definitive signs of sexual abuse. In addition, and importantly, from February 2008 until May 2010, the Depart<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>ment conducted fourteen sexual abuse investigations, all of which ruled out sexual abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">\n<em>Mental Injury Inquiry &amp; Evaluations of Raven</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">On May 14, 2010, the Department began an investigation into appellant for causing mental injury to Raven. Dr. Carlton E. Munson, a licensed certified social worker with a Ph.D. in clinical social work, evaluated Raven for mental injury on July 16 and August 4, 2010, after receiving a referral from Bruce McCarthy, an investigator from Child Protective Services (\u201cCPS\u201d). Previously, Dr. Munson assessed Raven on July 24 and September 10, 2008 upon referral from CPS.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">On October 29, 2010, Dr. Munson finalized his report on Raven, and diagnosed the child as having indications of mental injury. Dr. Munson determined that Raven had a \u201cpositive insecure attachment to her mother and father,\u201d and categorized her disorder under Axis I of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) as \u201cParent-Child Relational Problem.\u201d This finding echoed the diagnosis made by Raven\u2019s therapist, Amy Hershey, whom Dr. Munson interviewed. Hershey diagnosed Raven under Axis I as having an \u201cAdjustment Disorder with Mixed Anxiety and Depressed Mood,\u201d related to \u201cdealing with parental conflict and disagreement between households.\u201d Thus, both professionals determined that Raven had a mental injury that implicated her relationship with her family.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">According to Dr. Munson\u2019s report, Raven\u2019s mental injury manifested itself in various forms of emotional distress. Dr. Munson observed that Raven demonstrated neediness and insecurity around her immediate family, but in particular around appellant. Raven also displayed symptoms of generalized anxiety. Dr. Munson noted that Raven suffered from abnormally severe sleep disturbances and nightmares. Finally, Dr. Munson commented on the unusual nature of the sexual abuse allegations Raven made during his evaluation and the therapy sessions with Hershey. According to Dr. Munson, Raven generally made these disclosures to her family <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>and therapists, but not to investigators, and exhibited a willingness to expose herself.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">Dr. Munson further observed that Raven\u2019s mental injury had impaired Raven\u2019s emotional, social, and intellectual function. Dr. Munson reported that Raven was \u201ccurrently having functional problems at school.\u201d Dr. Munson gave an IQ test to Raven, which revealed a twenty-six-point discrepancy between the child\u2019s verbal and nonverbal scores. Dr. Munson theorized that the discrepancy could be caused by familial trauma. Finally, Dr. Munson\u2019s testing demonstrated an \u201coverall decline in meeting milestones\u201d since the evaluations he performed in 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">At the end of his report, Dr. Munson offered his opinion on the cause of Raven\u2019s mental injury and impairment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-6\">Based on the scales administered, the clinical interviews conducted, the collateral interviews conducted, and the documents reviewed, it is my professional opinion that Raven [ ] has been mentally injured and the source of the mental injury gives indication of being due to the mother\u2019s engaging in conscious or unconscious suggestive utterances to Raven about abuse by the father and engaging in alienating activities related to the father.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">In addition to Dr. Munson, McCarthy contacted Ronald E. Zuskin and requested that he conduct an assessment of Raven. From August 2010 to October 2010, Zuskin, a licensed certified social worker-clinical, reviewed Dr. Munson\u2019s report and interviewed appellant, Hershey, Mr. H., and Mr. H.\u2019s second wife, but did not interview Raven.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-9\">Zuskin\u2019s assessment of Raven was similar to Dr. Munson\u2019s evaluation. Zuskin adopted Hershey\u2019s diagnosis of \u201cAdjustment Disorder with Mixed Anxiety and Depressed Mood.\u201d Zuskin, like Dr. Munson, also determined that Raven had an unhealthy attachment to her mother, which he described in terms of an \u201cextreme over-involvement, intrusiveness and dominance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b288-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>Also like Dr. Munson, Zuskin reported that Raven\u2019s functioning had become impaired:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-4\">Raven\u2019s relations with authority figures, her peer relations, and her own reactivity to disruption in the environment indicate that not only is her current level of functioning impaired, but that without treatment and significant environmental changes she is a risk of greater disruption and regression.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">Zuskin also concluded that appellant exploited Raven through making repeated sexual abuse allegations, and that such exploitation caused Raven\u2019s impairment.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">\n<em>Procedural History</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">On December 15, 2010, the Department notified appellant that it had determined that she was responsible for indicated child abuse by mental injury. On January 14, 2011, appellant appealed the Department\u2019s finding of indicated child abuse-mental injury to the OAH. The ALJ held a contested case hearing on the matter on August 16 and September 19, 2011. On October 25, 2011, the ALJ issued a written decision, in which she concluded that (1) the finding of indicated child abuse-mental injury was supported by credible evidence and was consistent with the law, and (2) appellant was responsible for the indicated abuse.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">On November 23, 2011, appellant petitioned the Circuit Court for Washington County for judicial review of the ALJ\u2019s decision. On May 2, 2013, the circuit court affirmed the ALJ\u2019s decision. On May 30, 2013, appellant filed a timely notice of appeal to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>\n<em>STANDARD OF REVIEW</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">In <em>Charles County Department of Social Services v. Vann, </em>382 Md. 286, 855 A.2d 313 (2004), the Court of Appeals set forth in detail the appropriate standard of judicial review of the final decision of an administrative agency:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-5\">As a court sitting in judicial review of an administrative agency decision, this Court reviews the decision in the same posture as that of the courts below. That is to say, we reevaluate the decision of the agency under the same statutory standards as would the circuit court, and we do not employ those standards to reevaluate the decision of the circuit or intermediate appellate court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-6\">[Maryland Code (1984, 1999 Repl.Vol., 2003 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7 10-222(h) of the State Government Article (\u201cSG\u201d) ] sets forth standards of judicial review over agency decisions in contested cases and varies those standards depending on the type of agency determination under scrutiny. With regard to agency factual determinations, the standard of review is whether the finding is \u201cunsupported by competent, material, and substantial evidence in light of the entire record as submitted,\u201d also known as substantial evidence review. Under substantial evidence review of an agency\u2019s factual findings, a court is limited to ascertaining whether a reasoning mind could have reached the same factual conclusions reached by the agency on the record before it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-7\">With regard to agency legal conclusions, judicial review is less deferential to the agency. When an agency makes \u201cconclusions of law\u201d in a contested case, the [Administrative Procedure Act] permits the court, on judicial review, to decide the correctness of the agency\u2019s conclusions and to substitute the court\u2019s judgment for that of the agency\u2019s. Even with conclusions of law, however, an agency\u2019s legal interpretation of the statute it administers or of its own regulations is entitled to some deference from the courts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-8\">Other agency decisions fall -within categories that are neither legal conclusions nor factual findings, and some fall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>within both. These latter sort commonly are known as \u201cmixed questions of law and fact\u201d or applications of law to facts: The agency has correctly stated the law and its fact-finding is supported by the record, but the question is whether it has applied the law to the facts correctly. When the agency decision being judicially reviewed is a mixed question of law and fact, the reviewing court applies the substantial evidence test, that is, the same standard of review it would apply to an agency factual finding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b290-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 294-96, 855 A.2d 313 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">I. Substantial Evidence <em>&amp; </em>Legal Error</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">Appellant\u2019s main argument is that the record does not support the factual findings and legal conclusions made by the ALJ. The ALJ concluded her opinion by stating that \u201cAppellant's act of making multiple allegations of sex abuse of Raven by her father and subjecting Raven to repeated sexual abuse exams constitutes child abuse mental injury.\u201d The ALJ supported this conclusion with a lengthy review of the evidence, in which she heavily relied upon the evaluations of Dr. Munson and Zuskin:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-8\">This matter is complicated from th[e] standpoint [of assessing mental injury, because] the family dynamics and Raven\u2019s psychological state are intertwined and complex. I have given significant weight to both Dr. Munson\u2019s and [ ] Zuskin\u2019s test and reports. Their reports were thorough and provided clear and rational explanations for how the data they collected during their assessments supported their conclusions.... Both of the assessments address the information required by [the regulation concerning mental injury].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b290-9\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-10\">Accordingly, appellant attacks the ALJ\u2019s findings of fact by challenging the conclusions of Dr. Munson and Zuskin. Notably, appellant does not attack the evaluator\u2019s conclusions regarding the nature of Raven\u2019s mental injury or her impair<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>ment, described above, but instead objects to: (1) the admissibility of the expert opinions and their methodologies generally, and (2) the sufficiency of the experts\u2019 findings regarding <em>the cause </em>of Raven\u2019s mental injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">Furthermore, as part of her attack on sufficiency of the evidence with regard to causation, appellant challenges the ALJ\u2019s legal conclusion regarding scienter. Appellant argues that the ALJ erred by concluding that she was responsible for indicated child abuse by mental injury without determining whether she acted with the requisite intent. For the reasons set forth below, we reject appellant\u2019s arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">A. <em>Admissibility</em></p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">\n<em>\u201cCredibility\u201d Experts &amp; The Frye Standard</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">Appellant\u2019s first claim involves the admissibility of the expert opinions and assessments proffered by Dr. Munson and Zuskin. Appellant first contends that the assessments of Dr. Munson and Zuskin \u201cintruded into the power of the judge to assess credibility.\u201d More specifically, appellant asserts that the evaluators dismissed Raven\u2019s accusations based on their own assessments of the girl\u2019s credibility. Accordingly, appellant concludes that \u201c[e]xpert testimony that encroaches [on] the judge\u2019s function to adjudicate credibility is inadmissible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">Appellant also argues that \u201cneither Dr. Munson nor [] Zuskin provided the foundation of scientific acceptance for their opinions\u201d as required by <em>Frye v. United States, </em>293 F. 1013 (D.C.Cir.1923). Appellant claims that neither expert established that his assessment tools demonstrated scientific reliability and validity for the purpose of establishing a mental injury to a child as required by <em>Frye.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b291-9\">Appellant\u2019s arguments regarding the experts\u2019 improper credibility assessments and the <em>Frye </em>standard have been waived. <em>See Delmarva Power &amp; Light Co. v. Pub. Serv. Comm\u2019n of Md., </em>370 Md. 1, 32, 803 A.2d 460, <em>aff'd on other grounds, </em>371 Md. 356, 809 A.2d 640 (2002) (\u201cWe do not allow issues to be raised for the first time in actions for judicial review of administrative agency orders entered in contested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>cases because to do so would allow the court to resolve matters <em>ah initio </em>that have been committed to the jurisdiction and expertise of the agency.\u201d). Appellant never raised these issues before the ALJ, and in fact she accepted Dr. Munson and Zuskin as experts and allowed their reports and expert opinions to be admitted into evidence without objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">B. <em>Description of Bad Acts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">Appellant next attacks the substance of the evidence presented against her. We observe at this junction that to reach a finding of \u201cindicated\u201d requires that \u201cthere is credible evidence, which has not been satisfactorily refuted, that abuse, neglect, or sexual abuse did occur.\u201d Md.Code (1984, 2012 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 5-701(m) of the Family Law Article (\u201cFL\u201d). Child abuse is defined as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-6\">(b) Abuse.\u2014\u201cAbuse\u201d means:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-7\">(1) the physical or mental injury of a child by any parent or other person who has permanent or temporary care or custody or responsibility for supervision of a child, or by any household or family member, under circumstances that indicate that the child\u2019s health or welfare is harmed or at substantial risk of being harmed; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-8\">(2) sexual abuse of a child, whether physical injuries are sustained or not.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-9\">FL \u00a7 5-701(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-10\">COMAR 07.02.07.12(A)(3) (2014)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> sets forth the criteria for a finding of indicated child abuse by mental injury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-11\">(3) Abuse\u2014Mental Injury. A finding of indicated child abuse with mental injury is appropriate if there is credible evidence, which has not been satisfactorily refuted, that the following four elements are present:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-12\">(a) A current or prior mental injury characterized by an observable, identifiable, substantial impairment to the child\u2019s mental or psychological ability to function, which may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>be shown by the need for specific psychiatric, psychological, or social work intervention;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-4\">(b) The mental injury was caused by a parent, a caretaker, or household or family member;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-5\">(c) The alleged victim was a child at the time of the incident; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-6\">(d) The nature and extent of the mental injury indicate that the child\u2019s health or welfare was harmed or was at substantial risk of harm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">FL \u00a7 5-706 requires that any investigation into mental injury include two assessments by licensed physicians, licensed psychologists, or licensed social workers. FL \u00a7 5-706(d)(2). COMAR 07.02.07.09(B)(1)(b) sets forth the requirements of the assessments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-8\">(b) The professional assessment shall include:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-9\">(i) A determination whether the child has sustained a mental injury;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-10\">(ii) If applicable, a description of observable, identifiable, and substantial impairment of the child\u2019s mental or psychological ability to function; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-11\">(iii) If applicable, an explanation of the act or omission that is believed to have caused the mental injury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-12\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-13\">Based on this statutory and regulatory framework, appellant argues that the Department failed to sufficiently describe the <em>\u201cact or omission </em>that is believed to have caused the mental injury,\u201d and thus concludes that the ALJ had no basis on which to make a finding of indicated child abuse by mental injury. <em>See </em>COMAR 07.02.07.09(B)(11(b)(iii) (emphasis added). Appellant describes two insufficiencies in this regard that we address in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-14\">\n<em>Unconscious Acts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b293-15\">Appellant first asserts that the term \u201cact,\u201d as used in COMAR 07.02.07.09(B)(1)(b)(iii), \u201cdenotes a finding that the parent\u2019s conduct was voluntary and conscious.\u201d Appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>claims that the Department\u2019s assessments, conducted by Dr. Munson and Zuskin, described Raven\u2019s mental injury as caused by \u201cvague, unintentional acts\u201d that cannot constitute child abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">For example, appellant contends that Dr. Munson ascribed Raven\u2019s injury to appellant\u2019s unconscious behavior. Appellant supports this position with the following statement from Dr. Munson\u2019s report:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-5\">Based on the scales administered, the clinical interviews conducted, the collateral interviews conducted, and the documents reviewed, it is my professional opinion that Raven [ ] has been mentally injured and the source of the mental injury gives indication of being due to the mother\u2019s engaging in conscious or unconscious suggestive utterances to Raven about abuse by the father and engaging in alienating activities related to the father.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">According to appellant, Zuskin similarly determined that appellant\u2019s repeated sexual abuse allegations amounted to \u201cexploitation of Raven,\u201d which manifested as \u201canimated closesness and protectiveness [that] inadvertently reinforc[ed]\u201d continued sexual abuse allegations by Raven.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">Appellant mischaracterizes the experts\u2019 conclusions. Dr. Munson and Zuskin do in fact describe intentional acts as the cause of Raven\u2019s mental injury, specifically appellant\u2019s utterances and her making of sexual abuse allegations. When the experts referred to \u201cunconscious\u201d and \u201cinadvertent\u201d behavior, they did not intend to define appellant\u2019s abusive actions, but rather meant to describe either (1) the motivation behind appellant\u2019s actions, or (2) the effects resulting therefrom. In other words, the evaluators indicated that appellant committed these acts without consciously appreciating that (1) they were motivated by her desire to alienate Raven from her father, and (2) that they would cause Raven to repeatedly make false and detrimental sexual abuse allegations. Dr. Munson and Zuskin did not suggest that the \u201cact\u201d that injured Raven was involuntary, like a hiccup or a Tourette\u2019s outburst.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>This interpretation of the assessments is consistent with the ALJ\u2019s understanding of the evidence. After explaining why appellant\u2019s sexual abuse allegations were not justified, the ALJ concluded that appellant\u2019s actions <em>\u201cwere a result of </em>her subconscious efforts to have Raven remain close to her.\u201d (Emphasis added). In other words, appellant was <em>motivated </em>by her \u201csubconscious effort\u201d to keep Raven very close. According to the ALJ, the <em>act </em>that caused the injury, however, was the \u201cact of making multiple allegations of sex abuse of Raven by her father and subjecting Raven to repeated sexual abuse exams.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">\n<em>Speculative Acts &amp; Causation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">As part of her second argument regarding her alleged misconduct, appellant argues that Dr. Munson\u2019s and Zuskin\u2019s respective references to \u201cutterances\u201d and \u201cexploitation\u201d were unacceptably vague. More specifically, appellant criticizes Dr. Munson\u2019s and Zuskin\u2019s assessments for presenting circumstantial and non-specific evidence of her abusive behavior that was \u201cnever seen or described by any eyewitness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">Appellant also accuses the experts of speculating as to the causal link between appellant\u2019s behavior and Raven\u2019s mental injury, arguing, for example, that Dr. Munson used Raven\u2019s repeated sexual abuse allegations as \u201ca launching point to speculate concerning unobserved acts of mental injury by the mother.\u201d Appellant concludes that \u201cnothing scientific showed that the leap from repeated examinations to Raven\u2019s symptoms was to any reasonable degree of certainty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">Appellant is correct that her alleged misconduct cannot be reduced to taking Raven to the repeated examinations. Moreover, Dr. Munson and Zuskin did work backwards to some extent, first diagnosing Raven\u2019s mental injury and then associating that injury with a recognized pattern of abusive relationships. Contrary to appellant\u2019s argument, however, the experts presented evidence establishing that the abusive pattern did in fact exist and that it caused Raven\u2019s injury. In the process, the assessments made references to specific acts performed by appellant. We explain below.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>Dr. Munson described the exact nature of Raven\u2019s mental impairment, which, as stated above, appellant does not dispute. He described her as suffering from anxiety and from \u201cpositive insecure attachment to her mother,\u201d the latter of which he described as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-4\">[T]he child has an attachment to the parent, but they feel uncertain about the attachment in terms of whether the parent would play the protective role, will be the protector of them. So, they will also sometimes themselves become protective of the parent if they feel any kinds of distress in the parent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">Dr. Munson based this assessment on clinical evaluations and interviews, and described how Raven had multiple meltdowns in which she exhibited anxiety and protective behavior:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AbL\">During the four-hour evaluation session with [appellant], Raven had three episodes of extreme emotional distress. The first episode occurred when I attempted to escort Raven from the waiting room to the evaluation room. She clutched [appellant], cried and repeatedly stated she did not want to be asked any more questions, and she did not want her mother to have to fill out any more forms.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">(Emphasis added). Dr. Munson further observed that Raven\u2019s emotional distress was generally more apparent when the child interacted with appellant than it was when she visited with her father.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">Zuskin provided the best explanation of the mechanism that caused Raven\u2019s impairment.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-8\">The literature on false allegations lists a type of falsehood know as \u201cexaggerated positive feedback.\u201d In such instances the child senses the parent\u2019s need to hear certain things said. The parent responds with animated closeness and protectiveness, inadvertently reinforcing such behavior in the child.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-9\">Zuskin categorized this pattern of behavior as a form of \u201cexploitation,\u201d manifesting in this ease as \u201cextreme over-involvement, intrusiveness and dominance\u201d on the part of appellant. The positive feedback loop described by Zuskin <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>also explains how appellant\u2019s behavior caused Raven\u2019s symptomatic anxiety and inappropriate protectiveness. Appellant\u2019s \u201cneed to hear certain things\u201d put pressure on Raven to provide for her mother and protect her mother from any dissatisfaction when those needs were not met.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">The experts pointed to evidence demonstrating that the positive feedback loop existed between appellant and Raven. Zuskin stated that the \u201ccycle of making statements about abuse seems inextricably linked to visitation,\u201d because Raven\u2019s disclosures always occurred during reunions \"with appellant. This indicated to Zuskin that the abuse allegations were \u201crituals for re-establishing closeness,\u201d <em>ie. </em>reinforcing mutual protectiveness that comprised the positive feedback loop. Zuskin also noted that a link existed between the timing of appellant\u2019s accusations of abuse and declines in Raven\u2019s conditions. For example, Raven experienced a \u201cregression around the time of another sexual abuse allegation/investigation being made,\u201d after she had recovered from a previous regression triggered by her stepfather\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">The positive feedback loop was also indicated as a cause of Raven\u2019s mental injury, because Dr. Munson and Zuskin excluded other possible sources of injury. Zuskin observed that Raven\u2019s allegations did not include the \u201celaborative detail\u201d associated with statements about sexual abuse typically revealed by three- to five-year old children. Dr. Munson noted that Raven \u201cshowed no sexual behavior symptoms that are typical of a child that has experienced sexual abuse\u201d and also observed that Raven\u2019s affectionate relationship with her father was not typical of a child who was being sexually abused by that parent. Hershey informed Zuskin that \u201cRaven does not present with sexual-abuse specific symptoms or behaviors, but more generalized symptoms of trauma.\u201d Finally, according to the ALJ, there was \u201cabsolutely no medical evidence of any injury consistent with ongoing sexual abuse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">Dr. Munson also determined that inheritable mental illness as the source of Raven\u2019s impairment was unlikely, because children her age do not normally present with such disorders. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>Dr. Munson asserted that, with regard to Raven\u2019s \u201cdevelopmental setbacks,\u201d the \u201conly factor present is the repeated allegations of sexual abuse initiated by the mother.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">Lastly, the assessments of Dr. Munson and Zuskin provide specific examples of appellant\u2019s misconduct. Both Dr. Munson and Zuskin pointed to appellant\u2019s making allegations of abuse and taking Raven to exams, actions that they placed in the context of the positive feedback loop as a trigger for Raven to assert an unhealthy protectiveness of her mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">There were also examples of negative utterances. During the forensic exams, appellant expressed frustration about the legal process not taking the sexual abuse allegations seriously. On one occasion, appellant told the forensic nurse at Chambersburg hospital that \u201cthe Judge wont [sic] help her. They keep sending her back with her dad.\u201d Such comments gave Raven the impression that her mother was seeking something from the exams that she was not receiving, which Raven would then try to provide. Similarly, appellant rated Raven as having highly elevated trauma indicators on Dr. Munson\u2019s assessment, which suggested to Dr. Munson that appellant may have been \u201cfaking bad\u201d and creating a negative image of Raven.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">We conclude that the reports of Dr. Munson and Zuskin provide sufficient evidence of what acts appellant committed and how those acts caused Raven\u2019s mental injury. The ALJ accepted the \u201cexaggerated positive feedback\u201d loop as the cause of Raven\u2019s mental injury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-7\">It is the opinion of Dr. Munson that Raven has been mentally injured and that the source of the injury is [ ] [a]ppellant\u2019s exploitation of Raven by her use of sexual abuse allegations, investigations and examinations which encourages the development and reinforcement of aberrant behavior by drawing Raven in a closer relationship to [] [a]ppellant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-8\">Zuskin attributed the injury to [ ] [a]ppellant\u2019s exploitation of Raven. He explained that [ ] [a]ppellant\u2019s sexual abuse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>allegations that have resulted in exams and investigations constitute \u201cextreme over involvement, intrusiveness, and dominance.\u201d ... He stated that in his opinion Raven sensed [ ] [ajppellant\u2019s need to hear such statements and when [ ] [a]ppellant responded with animated protectiveness and closeness, she was reinforcing Raven\u2019s behavior.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-4\">Therefore, we hold that a reasoning mind, taking into account the facts presented and any reasonable inferences drawn therefrom, could have made the same findings as the ALJ. Accordingly, the ALJ\u2019s decision was supported by \u201ccompetent, material, and substantial evidence.\u201d SG \u00a7 10-222(h) (1984, 2009 Repl.Vol.).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">C. <em>Lack of Scienter</em></p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">Appellant argues that the ALJ erred by failing to determine whether appellant had intentionally or recklessly injured Raven. In other words, appellant contends that a finding of indicated child abuse must include some element of scienter. Appellant claims that without a scienter requirement, the sphere of parental action that could cause abuse by mental injury would become unconscionably vast:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-7\">Likewise, the parent\u2019s choice of the wrong school, public or private, or insistence on home schooling, could be indicated child abuse if some agency-appointed physician, psychologist, or social worker disagreed and opined that such had caused an \u201cimpairment\u201d of the child\u2019s \u201cmental or psychological ability to function.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">Appellant asserts that, under <em>In re Yve S., </em>373 Md. 551, 819 A.2d 1030 (2003), such a broad application of the State\u2019s power to find indicated child abuse is unconstitutional, because it would infringe on a \u201cparent\u2019s Fourteenth Amendment liberty interest in raising his or her children as he or she sees fit, without undue interference by the State.\u201d According to appellant, a scienter requirement of either intent or recklessness would be an appropriate limitation on the State\u2019s power.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-9\">Appellant also claims that the scienter requirement already exists in the context of indicated physical child abuse. Appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>lant cites to <em>Taylor v. Harford County Department of Social Services, </em>in which the Court of Appeals determined that, \u201cwhere an act by a parent or caregiver is injurious to that person\u2019s child, and the injury was unintentional, under Title 5 of the Family Law Article and COMAR 07.02.07.12, <em>the injurious act should not constitute \u2018indicated\u2019 child physical abuse unless it can be shown to have been reckless conduct.\u201d </em>384 Md. 213, 216, 862 A.2d 1026 (2004) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">The Department counters that <em>Taylor </em>does not apply to the case <em>sub judice, </em>because <em>Taylor </em>involved indicated physical child abuse, and not abuse by mental injury. The Department observes that the physical abuse regulation relevant to the <em>Taylor </em>decision contained an explicit scienter element. By contrast, the Department asserts, the mental injury regulation does not contain any scienter requirement, and that the \u201clegislative history confirms the plain statutory meaning.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">The parties\u2019 arguments essentially pit the statute and regulations against the <em>Taylor </em>decision. After careful consideration of each argument, we agree with the Department that no scienter requirement is required for a finding of indicated child abuse by mental injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>\n<em>Scienter in Title 5 of the Family Law Article &amp; COMAR</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\">The Department correctly states that the statute and regulations pertaining to indicated child abuse by mental injury do not include a scienter element. As indicated above, a parent must simply have \u201ccaused\u201d the mental injury. COMAR 07.02.07.12(A)(3)(b). The statute defines \u201cmental injury\u201d as an \u201cobservable, identifiable, and substantial impairment,\u201d but does not describe the mental state associated with inflicting the injury. FL \u00a7 5-701(r).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">Also, as the Department pointed out, the statutory and regulatory scheme does not reveal any intention on the part of the legislature or agency to require a scienter element in cases of indicated child abuse by mental injury. For example, the definition of \u201cruled out\u201d child abuse in COMAR 07.02.07.12 specifically requires the presence of scienter vis-a-vis physical injury, but does not extend such requirement to mental injury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ayi\">C. Ruled Out Child Abuse. A finding of ruled out child abuse is appropriate if child abuse did not occur. A finding of ruled out may be based on credible evidence that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-6\">(1) There was no physical or mental injury or, in the case of suspected sexual abuse, no sexual molestation or exploitation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-7\">(2) In the case of physical abuse:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-8\">(a) The alleged abuser was not responsible for the injury for reasons including, but not limited to, one of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-9\">(i) The contact with the child was accidental and unintended and under the circumstances, the injury was not foreseeable!.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b301-10\">COMAR 07.02.07.12(C) (emphasis added). The presence and then absence of language defining or describing child abuse by physical injury and by mental injury is significant in the construction of the regulation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-11\">\u201c[W]hen the legislature [or agency] uses certain language in one part of the statute and different language in another, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>the court assumes different meanings were intended. In like manner, where the legislature has carefully employed a term in one place and excluded it in another, it should not be implied where excluded. The use of different terms within related statutes generally implies that different meanings were intended.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b302-4\"><em>Toler v. Motor Vehicle Admin., </em>373 Md. 214, 223-24, 817 A.2d 229 (2003) (first alteration in original) (emphasis added) (quoting 2A Norman J. Singer, <em>Sutherland Statutes and Statutory Construction </em>\u00a7 46.06 (6th ed.2000)); <em>see also Brown v. Brown, </em>287 Md. 273, 277, 412 A.2d 396 (1980) (\u201cGenerally speaking, the same rules that are applicable to the construction of statutory language are employed in interpreting constitutional verbiage[.]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">The legislative history of the mental injury statute itself is also instructive. As appellant observed, the legislature adopted child abuse by mental injury in 1994 for \u201cthe purpose of ... altering the definitions of child abuse and neglect; ... requiring the investigation to include a certain assessment if mental injury is suspected[.]\u201d 1994 Md. Laws, Chap. 728, at 3232-33. Appellant notes that these changes were necessary in order to maintain compliance with federal law and eligibility for federal funds. The federal regulation, however, never defined mental injury. <em>See </em>45 C.F.R. \u00a7 1340.2(d) (2013). Ultimately, the statute and regulations pertaining to mental injury simply do not contain a scienter requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\"><em>The </em>Taylor <em>Decision</em></p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">As the Department indicated, the <em>Taylor </em>decision involved only physical abuse, specifically where a father intentionally kicked a foot stool in anger, which unintentionally struck his daughter in the face. <em>Taylor, </em>384 Md. at 217, 862 A.2d 1026. The Harford County Department of Social Services found the father responsible for indicated child physical abuse, and an ALJ upheld the decision. <em>Id. </em>at 215, 862 A.2d 1026.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-8\">The case required the Court of Appeals to address an earlier version of statutory definition of \u201cruled out\u201d child <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>abuse. <em>See id. </em>at 223-26, 862 A.2d 1026. In relevant part, the previous version of COMAR 07.02.07.12(C) provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-4\">C. Ruled Out Child Abuse. A finding of ruled out child abuse is appropriate if child abuse did not occur. A finding of ruled out may be based on credible evidence that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-5\">(1) There was no physical or mental injury or, in the case of suspected sexual abuse, no sexual molestation or exploitation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-6\">(2) In the case of physical abuse:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-7\">(a) The alleged abuser was not responsible for the injury for reasons including, but not limited to, one of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-8\">(i) The act causing the injury was accidental or unintentional and not reckless or deliberate!.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b303-9\">COMAR 07.02.07.12(C) (2004) (emphasis added). As stated above, subparagraph 2(a)(i) currently reads: \u201cThe contact with the child was accidental and unintended and under the circumstances, the injury was not foreseeable[.]\u201d COMAR 07.02.07.12(C)(2)(a)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-10\">Getting ahead of the agency, the ALJ in <em>Taylor </em>applied a foreseeability standard and concluded that \u201cphysical abuse had occurred because appellant had intentionally kicked the footstool and that under a foreseeability analysis that intent to kick the footstool was the equivalent of an intention to injure and thus met the \u2018intent\u2019 standard of the statute and regulation.\u201d 384 Md. at 216, 862 A.2d 1026. Based on the then-existing language of COMAR 07.02.07.12(C)(2)(a)(i), the Court of Appeals held that the ALJ should have applied a recklessness standard, instead of a foreseeability standard, to determine whether the lather\u2019s unintended injury of his child constituted indicated physical abuse. <em>Id. </em>at 232-33, 862 A.2d 1026.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-11\">Although the <em>Taylor </em>Court\u2019s holding was limited to the determination of \u201cruled out\u201d physical abuse, the language of the decision suggested a much broader application. Appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>claims that the language of <em>Taylor </em>requires a finding of intent or recklessness for all child abuse. Appellant relies on the following passage from <em>Taylor:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-4\">The threshold question that must be determined in a case such as this is whether the act causing injury to a child was done with an intent to injure or was done recklessly and injury resulted. In the case <em>sub judice, </em>intent is relevant only insofar as determining whether there was an intent actually to injure the child. .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-5\">Furthermore, if we were to abide by the methodology by which the ALJ interpreted \u00a7 5-701 of the Family Law Article and the pertinent COMAR regulations, it appears that <em>any </em>intentional act by a parent or caretaker which has the unintentional consequence of harming that person\u2019s child would amount to child abuse, and result in the parent being placed on the central registry of individuals responsible for child abuse, basically creating a strict liability standard for parents or caretakers who unintentionally injure their children.... We doubt that either \u00a7 5-701 of the Family Law Article or COMAR 07.02.07.12 intends for such a draconian strict liability standard always to attach to the intentional acts of parents or caretakers who unintentionally injure their children.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b304-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 230-31, 862 A.2d 1026 (bold emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">Although in the cited passage above the Court of Appeals does not expressly limit the application of a scienter requirement to physical abuse, we refuse to read a scienter requirement into mental abuse where the statute and regulations are silent.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The <em>Taylor </em>Court\u2019s admonition against strict liability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>is strong, but cannot compel this court to usurp the role of the legislature or agency and write in a crucial element of the law that does not exist. <em>See Toler, </em>373 Md. at 223-24, 817 A.2d 229. The ALJ therefore did not err by failing to include scienter as an element of indicated child abuse by mental injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">II. Privilege</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">Appellant contends that the ALJ erred by allowing McCarthy, Dr. Munson, and Zuskin to testify about their communications with Hershey, the social worker who provided therapy to both Raven and appellant. Appellant contends that her communications with Hershey, as well as those of Raven, are privileged under Maryland Code (2006, 2013 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 9-121 of the Courts <em>&amp; </em>Judicial Proceedings Article (II) (\u201cCJ\u201d). Because Hershey is licensed in Pennsylvania, where the therapy took place, appellant also contends that Pennsylvania privilege law prohibits the disclosure of her family\u2019s therapy sessions with Hershey. Appellant argues that the ALJ summarily denied her privilege assertion without conducting the necessary inquiry into the existence and coverage of the privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">The Department responds that the social-worker privilege does not apply to Hershey because CJ \u00a7 9-121 applies to individuals \u201clicensed as certified social worker[s] under [Maryland] Title 19 of the Health Occupations Article\u201d and appellant failed to establish that Hershey was licensed anywhere other than Pennsylvania. The Department also contends that no Pennsylvania privilege would apply, and even if such privilege <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>did apply, there is an exception for the disclosure of Hershey\u2019s opinions and reports for the purpose of any child abuse proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">Appellant\u2019s argument is not preserved for our review, because she failed to raise before the ALJ any privilege under Maryland or Pennsylvania law.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> When appellant objected to testimony from McCarthy regarding his conversations with Hershey and the use of her report, appellant did not assert any privilege. Instead, appellant referenced the fact that communications with Hershey had been deemed privileged in the collateral child custody proceeding. Because Raven had not waived her privilege in that proceeding, appellant expressed concern that she would not be able to call Hershey as witness, and thus her ability to rebut McCarthy\u2019s testimony would be undermined. The colloquy read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-5\">[DEPARTMENT]: All right. Did you ever speak to Raven\u2019s therapist?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-6\">[MCCARTHY]: I did. I also obtained a written statement of her\u2014summarizing her work with Raven up until that time, which was December 2010.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-7\">[DEPARTMENT]: And what did she state?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-8\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Your Honor, I\u2019d like to object to this, and here\u2019s why. In the collateral civil custody case, the best interest attorney for Raven did not waive Raven\u2019s privilege. And at that lawyer\u2019s direction, no evidence was therefore permitted as to what Raven\u2019s therapist said or didn\u2019t say, what findings she made or didn\u2019t make.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-9\">So, I\u2019d ask that since we can\u2019t\u2014even if we had been inclined to subpoena Raven\u2019s therapist, the best interest attorney would not permit that. And so, the therapist would have effectually come here and said, I can\u2019t testify because I\u2019m under\u2014I\u2019m under an assertion of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>privilege by the child\u2019s agent, the best interest attorney.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-4\">This isn\u2019t evidence we would even be able to rebut. It just\u2014if it comes in, sadly, it\u2019ll just come in. And I don\u2019t think it\u2019s even appropriate for it to come in. I haven\u2019t talked to Ms. Sadikian (phonetic), the attorney for the child in that other case. But that\u2019s my motion, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-6\">[ALJ]: Do you want to respond?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-7\">[DEPARTMENT] I believe it would come in under the hearsay [rules]. And this\u2014I know that custody is a totally different animal. And it was part of his notes and part of the investigation in collateral who he talked to and what they said.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-8\">[JUDGE]: I\u2019m going to overrule the objection. You can go ahead.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-9\">[MCCARTHY]: Well, I had a brief telephone conversation with her, and I summarized\u2014what I just read is my summary of what she told me. And she followed that up with a written summary, which is contained in the record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-10\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL] Your Honor, I\u2019m going to respectfully not continue to make this objection over and over again. I would like\u2014Your Honor\u2019s overruled my objection. I would like leave in light of that to bring Amy Hershey. Maybe just leave that one issue open for her testimony, because, again, we\u2019ve been\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-11\">[JUDGE]: Okay. Well, we\u2019ll get to that ... in your case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b307-12\">No specific privilege applicable to the instant case was ever mentioned, and appellant even suggested calling Hershey during her own case. In addition, appellant did not object to the admission of the reports of McCarthy, Dr. Munson and Zuskin, all of which incorporated their communications with Hershey.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-13\">In sum, appellant failed to assert any privilege during the administrative proceeding as she was required to do. <em>See, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number><em>e.g., Catler v. Arent Fox, LLP, </em>212 Md.App. 685, 702-03, 71 A.3d 155 <em>cert. denied, </em>435 Md. 502, 79 A.3d 947 (2013) (concluding that in the context of attorney-client privilege, it is well-established that the burden of establishing the privilege is on the party asserting the privilege). Instead, her counsel relied on the failure to waive Raven\u2019s privilege in the civil custody matter. Thus we conclude that the privilege issue was not preserved for appellate review. <em>See Delmarva Power &amp; Light Co., </em>370 Md. at 32, 803 A.2d 460.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">III. Immunity</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">Finally, appellant claims that she should be granted immunity, because she was required to report child abuse to the Department. Again, appellant failed to raise such issue before the ALJ. Appellant claims, nevertheless, that the issue has been preserved under <em>Motor Vehicle Administration v. Lytle, </em>because the claim is \u201cexpressly encompassed in the final decision of the ALJ.\u201d 374 Md. 37, 55, 821 A.2d 62 (2003) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">An issue can be preserved without having been previously raised if the resolution of that issue is integral to the legal determination of the case. <em>Eng\u2019g Mgmt. Servs., Inc. v. Md. State Highway Admin., </em>375 Md. 211, 235, 825 A.2d 966 (2003). A legal defense, such as immunity, that does not appear in the statute or in the implementing regulations does not qualify as integral and can be waived. Thus appellant\u2019s immunity claim has not been preserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">For the reasons set forth above, we uphold the decision of the ALJ that appellant was responsible for child abuse by mental injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-8\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR WASHINGTON COUNTY AFFIRMED; APPELLANT TO PAY COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b283-9\">. Appellant\u2019s original questions read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-10\">1. Whether the OAH decision was supported by competent, material, and substantial evidence in light of the entire record, or was otherwise arbitrary or capricious?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-11\">2. Whether purported subconscious efforts by a mother to have her daughter remain close to her are sufficient to find that the mother is responsible for indicated mental injury of a child under the child abuse laws?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-12\">3. Whether the OAH decision resulted from or was affected by the ALJ\u2019s decision to admit evidence in violation of both Maryland and Pennsylvania law governing privilege?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-13\">4. Whether the OAH decision against the Petitioner violated the immunity provisions of Family Law Article \u00a7 5-708 and Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article \u00a7 5-620?</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b284-9\">. Appellant also took Raven to eight appointments with her pediatrician for symptoms similar to those that prompted the physical exams.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b285-7\">. Raven elaborated on this allegation by stating that her father used the needle on her because \"he had to sew up my front bottom and back bottom up because the [family\u2019s pet] goat bit through it.\u2019\u2019 Such fantastical sounding allegations were not standard for Raven, but also not uncommon. For example, Raven also told hospital staff on another occasion that a \u201cmonster came from a cave and touched her.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b285-8\">. The one exceptional forensic finding consisted of a \"black course hair\" found on Raven's genitals on November 17, 2010, during a doctor\u2019s visit at which Raven referenced sexual abuse. Physician's Assistant Jane Shughart determined that the hair \u201cdid not look like a hair from a head.\" Under instructions from Shughart, appellant took Raven to Washington County Hospital, where a police officer interviewed Raven. The hospital did not examine Raven or the hair based on instructions from the Department.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b288-9\">. The Department also investigated appellant for child neglect, and, on October 4, 2010, made a finding of indicated child neglect. Appellant appealed this finding as well, and the ALJ determined that the finding of indicated child neglect should be modified to ruled-out child neglect. The Department did not seek judicial review of the ALJ's decision in this regard.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b292-13\">. Unless otherwise indicated, all citations to COMAR refer to the 2014 regulations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b300-6\">. The Department also claims that the scienter issue is not preserved for appellate review, because appellant did not raise it before the ALJ. Like the circuit court, we reject this argument. The scienter issue is integral to the legal disposition of this matter and thus is preserved. <em>See Eng'g Mgmt. Servs., Inc. v. Md. State Highway Admin., </em>375 Md. 211, 235, 825 A.2d 966 (2003). The Court of Appeals stated in <em>Engineering Mianagement Services, Inc.:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-7\">The [agency] argues, and the Court of Special Appeals agreed, that the issue of the [Board\u2019s] failure to promulgate rules was not preserved for review as [the appellant] failed to raise the issue during the proceedings before the [Board]. Judicial review of administrative decisions generally is limited to the issues raised before the agency. We reach this issue, however, not because [the appellant] raised it on appeal, but rather because it is an integral, and thus unavoidable, component of our determination of the properly raised issue of whether the [Board\u2019s] grant of summary disposition was appropriate in this case. This is because the [Board\u2019s] failure to adopt pertinent procedural rules in the case <em>sub judice </em>interferes with the ability of the courts to perform their constitutional function of review.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b300-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 235, 825 A.2d 966 (citations omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b304-8\">. It instructive to note that physical abuse cannot occur unless the child bears the brunt of the parent\u2019s force, whether the parent intended to strike the child, (a purposeful smack to the head), or not, (a collision with a poorly kicked footstool). The regulations concerning child abuse by mental injury, however, clearly contemplate mental injury being caused by actions <em>not </em>directed at the child:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>(2) If an investigation of abuse or neglect suggests issues relating to a child\u2019s emotional or psychological well-being, a separate investigation of mental injury may be conducted after consideration of any of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-8\">(a) Implied or overt threat of death or serious injury to the child or other individuals;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-9\">(b) Implied or overt threat in the form of pet or animal torture;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-10\">(c) Constant denigration of the child;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-11\">(d) Extensive emotional or physical isolation or confinement of the child; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-12\">(e) Domestic violence in the home.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b305-13\">COMAR 07.02.07.08(C)(2) (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b306-10\">. Appellant also failed to establish that Hershey was a licensed social worker in Maryland. Thus Maryland Code (2006, 2013 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 9-121 of the Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Article (II) does not apply.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
