Proof of lack of consent will routinely consist of a negative response, either explicit or implicit, on the part of the victim. The key issue on this appeal arises, however, from the fact that the lack of consent may, under certain circumstances, be proved simply by showing a non-response. The negative response and the non-response may have the same effect but they are proved in very different ways. It is that difference in proof that gives rise to this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-11\">The appellant, James Lee Travis, was convicted in the Circuit Court for Worcester County by Judge Thomas C. Groton, III, sitting without a jury, of second-degree rape, a second-degree sexual offense, a third-degree sexual offense, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>and second-degree assault. For the second-degree rape, the appellant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 20 years with all but 10 years suspended to be followed by two years of probation. For sentencing purposes, the remaining convictions merged into that for second-degree rape. On appeal, the appellant raises three contentions, claiming</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-4\">1. that the State\u2019s evidence was not legally sufficient to support his convictions;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-5\">2. that the verdicts of guilty were inconsistent with his acquittal on the charge of a fourth-degree sexual offense; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-6\">3. that Judge Groton erroneously found him guilty of a second-degree sexual offense after earlier having announced that his verdict on that charge was \u201cnot guilty.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">Legal Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b438-8\">Although there were convictions for other peripheral sexual offenses, it will be convenient narratively to focus primarily on the conviction for rape. Rape was the core issue at the appellant\u2019s trial and it is for rape that he is serving an effective sentence of ten years imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-9\">What began as a convivial social evening among four acquaintances ultimately, after several hours of reasonably heavy drinking, turned criminal. The situs where the evening\u2019s activities both began and concluded was the small efficiency apartment of Kelly Belay in Ocean City. On the evening of May 23, 2013, the rape victim, a young woman who had been a friend of Ms. Belay since high school, went to her friend\u2019s apartment to celebrate the victim\u2019s birthday. The two young women initially \u201chung out, sat on the balcony, [and] had a couple beers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b438-10\">They were joined in the course of the evening by two young men, the appellant and one Kwamaine Fisher, a friend of Ms. Belay. There had been no prior romantic relationship between the victim and the appellant, but she had seen him \u201csocially\u201d \u201cquite a few times.\u201d The foursome sat on the balcony for \u201c45 minutes to an hour.\u201d They then all walked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>across the street to a bar called Pit-N-Pub and stayed there for \u201cmaybe about an hour and a half.\u201d While at the pub, the victim consumed \u201cone shot and maybe two beers.\u201d The victim could not recall what the appellant had to drink at the pub, but she did remember that all four of them had \u201ca shot\u201d at midnight. All four of them left the Pit-N-Pub at about 1:00 a.m., went across the street to get some food at a 7-Eleven, and then went back to Ms. Belay\u2019s apartment. The group \u201csat around\u201d for another hour or more.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">The victim decided to go to bed at approximately 2:00 or 2:30 a.m. She went to bed before everyone else because she had to be at work the following morning at 8:00 a.m. She went to bed in the interior room of the efficiency apartment, while the other three remained outside on the balcony. The victim went to sleep on a \u201cMurphy bed,\u201d \u201ca bed that pulls down out of the wall.\u201d She testified that as she was going to bed, she felt tired and \u201ca little bit\u201d intoxicated. She went to bed in her clothes, the same clothes that she had worn to work that day, black pants and a black shirt. Significantly, she went to bed alone and she went to sleep.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">In her testimony, Ms. Belay added that throughout the course of the evening, the victim and the appellant were not together as a couple. She confirmed that she did not believe that anything flirtatious was going on between them. She further testified that it was her impression, before she herself fell asleep, that Kwamaine Fisher and the appellant were not intending to spend the night at her apartment. The appellant specifically told Ms. Belay that he was going to drive home because he was not intoxicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">Approximately two hours after she went to sleep, the victim awoke in the process of being raped. She remembered \u201cwaking up and James was having sex with me.\u201d She was on her back in the bed and her pants had been pulled down to her knees. Her shirt was still on. Her testimony was that the appellant was on top of her, \u201chis penis was in [her] vagina,\u201d and he was \u201cthrusting, like if you were having sex.\u201d When she \u201cwoke up and realized ... what he was doing,\u201d she \u201cput <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>[her] hand on his chest to try to push him off.\u201d When he did not stop, she told him either, \u201cNo, I can\u2019t do this,\u201d or \u201cNo, this can\u2019t happen.\u201d When she spoke those words, the appellant \u201cstopped,\u201d got up, pulled up his pants, and walked out of the apartment without saying a word. She looked at her cell phone and saw that the time was 4:42 a.m. The victim immediately \u201cgot [her] belongings,\u201d tried unsuccessfully to wake Fisher, who was \u201cpassed out\u201d on the floor, and left the apartment in her car.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">At this point, we note that there is no dispute about the occurrence of the act of sexual intercourse <em>per se. </em>The appellant, in his statement to the police which he does not challenge, acknowledged that he had sexual intercourse with the victim. His defense was that the intercourse was consensual. He now argues, somewhat self-righteously, that he stopped immediately upon being told to stop by the victim. When asked by the police, however, if the victim had been awake when he first penetrated her, \u201che advised [the police] that he wasn\u2019t sure if she was awake or not at the time because he hadn\u2019t looked at her eyes to see if they were open.\u201d The appellant also told the police that he did not think he had ejaculated when he hurriedly dressed and left the apartment, prompting the police comment, \u201cwhich I found unusual.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">Saving for the moment our discussion of the consent issue on the rape charge, there is no dispute about the proof of the <em>actus reus of </em>second-degree rape or the <em>actus reus of </em>the necessarily lesser included simple assault. It is only with respect to the proof of the second-degree sexual offense and the third-degree sexual offense that we turn to the victim\u2019s testimony about her semi-conscious memory of what occurred before she came fully awake in the process of being raped. Judge Groton expressly found the victim to be completely credible. He accepted, as was his factfinding prerogative, not only her fully conscious memory but also her hazier quasi-conscious memory. The victim testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-7\">A. <em>I remember falling asleep on my right side, </em>and <em>I don\u2019t remember him getting in bed. </em>I <em>don\u2019t\u2014I remember him pulling on my left shoulder to turn me over. </em>And I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>remember <em>him\u2014I remember him kissing me on the mouth. I remember him putting his hands under my shirt. </em>I remember him\u2014I remember rolling\u2014trying to roll back over. And <em>I remember him pulling my pants down while I was on my right side. He was behind me. I remember him trying to have anal sex with me. I remember him pulling on my shoulder a few times hard enough where I had a bruise on my shoulder. </em>And when I woke up was when\u2014I mean, I <em>remember\u2014I remember him trying to put his penis in my mouth.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-5\">Q. Can you describe how that happened?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-6\">A. <em>I had rolled over on my left side. So we would have been facing each other. And I remember him like moving towards the top of the bed so </em>he <em>was\u2014he was lying above me.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-7\">THE COURT: <em>At what point did these things occur?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-8\">THE WITNESS: <em>Before\u2014before I woke up and tried to push him off.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-9\">THE COURT: Immediately before? Some time before?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-10\">THE WITNESS: I felt like it was right before. I mean, between when I went to bed at 2:00, around 2:00, and then when I woke up.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-11\">THE COURT: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-12\">THE WITNESS: I don\u2019t\u2014I don\u2019t know the time\u2014the time frame.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-13\">[PROSECUTOR]: <em>Did you fully wake up during any of this?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-14\">A. <em>No.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-15\">Q. Okay. So\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-16\">A. I remember\u2014I remember\u2014I remember it happening. I\u2014it\u2019s hard to\u2014it\u2019s hard to explain. <em>It almost felt like a dream.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-17\">Q. Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-18\">A. <em>I think that\u2019s why I kept trying to roll over.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-19\">Q. Did you realize what was happening?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-20\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>Q. So when you say you remember him trying to put his penis [in] your mouth, what exactly do you recall happening? You said\u2014you began to describe that he went to\u2014he scooted up the bed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-5\">A. Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-6\">Q. Can you describe what you remember happening?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-7\">A. I remember <em>him\u2014my mouth was dosed. I remember him trying to force his penis into my mouth. </em>And <em>I assume it was because I was so tired and I had been drinking, but I didn\u2019t have the strength\u2014all I could do was try and keep my mouth dosed, my teeth closed, so that\u2019s what I did.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-8\">Q. And at this time, is this when you described that you were face to face?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-9\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-10\">Q. And <em>when you say him trying to put his penis in your mouth, was there any contact between his penis and your mouth?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-11\">\n<em>A. It touched my teeth.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-12\">Q. And what did you do at that time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-13\">A. I remember rolling over.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-14\">Q. Do you recall if you went back to sleep after that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-15\">A. I don\u2019t recall. I don\u2019t know if I fell back asleep. I don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-16\">Q. And the next thing\u2014is the next thing you remember happening after that waking up to him having sex with you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-17\">A. <em>I\u2014I don\u2019t remember the order of how everything happened. </em>When\u2014when he <em>was\u2014the last thing that happened was him on top of me, having sex with me. </em>I don\u2019t remember what happened before that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-18\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-19\">In terms of the legal sufficiency of the proof of a second-degree sexual offense, fellatio qualifies as a \u201csexual act,\u201d which is the gravamen of the crime. For the appellant to place his penis inside the lips and in contact with the teeth of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>the victim qualifies as oral-genital contact within the contemplation of the term \u201cfellatio.\u201d <em>Thomas v. State, </em>301 Md. 294, 321-22, 483 A.2d 6 (1984). The appellant does not claim that the act of fellatio never occurred or that it was consensual.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\">In terms of the legal sufficiency of the proof of a third-degree sexual offense, the required \u201csexual contact\u201d for that offense is defined as \u201can intentional touching of the victim\u2019s or actor\u2019s genital, anal, or other intimate area for sexual arousal or gratification, or for the abuse of either party.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">Just as the rape necessarily included a second-degree or simple assault, so too, of course, did the second-degree sexual offense and so too did the third-degree sexual offense. The second-degree assault, an act of offensive touching, was proved three times over.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">Although the appellant seeks to characterize the victim\u2019s failure to report the rape to the police for a week as exculpatory, a fair reading of the victim\u2019s post-rape behavior could just as readily, if not more readily, be deemed strong evidence that the sexual intercourse had, indeed, been non-consensual. To get up suddenly within two hours of having gone to bed and to drive home at 5:00 a.m. is not a routine reaction for one who is comfortably content with the events of the preceding evening. The victim testified that she was reluctant to go to the police because she was not at all sure whether the appellant\u2019s contact with her, because of her having been asleep and because of her antecedent drinking, even constituted a crime. She was uncomfortably aware that her own behavior may have placed her in a compromised position. She recounted what had happened to her that very day, however, to Kelly Belay. She also promptly reported what had happened to Kwamaine Fisher.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">Very persuasive evidence of her state of mind, moreover, was what happened five days after the attack. She was out with friends at a bar when she unexpectedly saw the appellant. He walked by, turned and looked at her, and kept walking. Feeling as if she were going to have a panic attack, she went outside. An employee of the bar, Mike Bowling, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>noticed the strange interaction between the two. When he went outside to smoke a cigarette, he saw the victim \u201ccompletely distraught\u201d and crying. He spoke to her for 20 to 25 minutes and the victim recounted to him what had happened five days earlier. He went back inside and told the appellant to leave the bar. It was Bowling, moreover, who persuaded the victim to report the incident to the police the next day. She did.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">The day after her report to the police, the victim was seen by a forensic nurse examiner who conducted an external examination of her based on her complaint of pain in her genital area. The nurse observed redness to the posterior fourchette area of her genitals.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">Factfinding Is Not Our Job</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">Before turning to the legal issue of what constitutes proof of non-consent, a comment is in order about the pertinence of certain standard defense arguments we invariably receive on the issue of the legal sufficiency of the evidence in cases of this sort. In arguing legal sufficiency here, the appellant observes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-8\">At the conclusion of direct examination [the victim] testified that she did not consent to any of the sexual contact that occurred between herself and Appellant. <em>Her actions, </em>however, <em>tell a different story.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-9\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-10\">The appellant goes on to put a decidedly puritanical spin on the behavior of the victim, including such misogynistic, if not indeed mid-Victorian, insinuations as the revelation that she was not wearing any underwear and the disapproving observation that she had been drinking all evening. For shame! Even accepting, <em>arguendo, </em>such characterizations, however, what difference should it make to us that her actions tell a different story? Is the appellant trying to persuade us of facts as if we were the factfinders? Virtually every crime testified to by multiple witnesses could give rise to half a dozen conceivable scenarios or different stories. That is why <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>we have factfinders. We, on the other hand, are not concerned with those other possible stories, because we are not factfinders. The factfinding job has already been done by someone else. All that matters at this juncture is that the factfinding judge believed the victim\u2019s story. Unless clearly eironeous (a rare phenomenon, indeed), Judge Groton\u2019s findings of fact are the only facts in the case as far as we are concerned. There are no other stories. No other facts or factual scenarios even exist and it is pointless, therefore, to bring them up. In assessing legal sufficiency, we are required to take that version of the evidence most favorable to the prevailing party. What then is the appellant seeking to do by beguiling us with \u201cdifferent stories\u201d which are immaterial to the only legal issue before us? An appraisal of legal sufficiency is not a proper venue for jury argument. Appellate concern is not with what should be believed, but only with what could be believed.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">The Absence of Consent</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">The appellant\u2019s core argument on the issue of lack of consent is too clever by half. Maryland Code, Criminal Law Article, \u00a7 3-304(a) describes at least three (and perhaps five) modalities by which one might commit the crime of second-degree rape.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-7\">(a) Prohibited.\u2014A person may not engage in vaginal intercourse with another:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-8\">(1) by force, or the threat of force, without the consent of the other;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-9\">(2) if the victim is a mentally defective individual, a mentally incapacitated individual, or a physically helpless individual, and the person performing the act knows or reasonably should know that the victim is a mentally defective individual, a mentally incapacitated individual, or a physically helpless individual; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-10\">(3) if the victim is under the age of 14 years, and the person performing the act is at least 4 years older than the victim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>Regardless of which particular modality is employed on a particular occasion, second-degree rape is a single crime with a single penalty provision. Notwithstanding the variation in modalities, the critical denominator is the act of engaging in sexual intercourse with a woman without her consent. The modalities simply represent different ways in which that consent may be found to have been lacking. Consent may, of course, be lacking because it was expressly denied. Consent may also be lacking because it was implicitly denied, the denial being evidenced by either some degree of resistance or by a rational fear of resisting. By way of significant contrast, consent may also be lacking because the victim, for a variety of reasons, may have been incapable of giving any consent at all or incompetent to give legally cognizable consent. All of these absences of consent, however, are simply variations on a common theme. In this case, the charging document simply alleged, with respect to the rape, a violation of \u00a7 3-304(a). It did not particularize which precise modality or combination of modalities the appellant employed.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">Indeed, until the 1976 and 1977 legislative sessions codifying the various sexual offenses in Maryland, the crime of rape in Maryland was the common law felony of that name. The statutory codification was essentially for the purpose of graduating the possible penalties for different circumstances under which the rape or other sexual offense was committed. It was well explained by \u201cRape and Other Sexual Offense Law Reform in Maryland, 1976-1977,\u201d 7 <em>U. Balt. L.Rev. </em>151, 152 (1977):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-6\"><em>Prior to the 1976 session </em>of the Maryland Legislature, <em>the Maryland rape statute was primarily a sentencing law, </em>fixing the penalties without actually defining the crime. Therefore, in order <em>to discern what constituted the crime of rape, an examination of the common law was necessary</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-7\"><em>Common law rape was often defined as \u201cthe act of a man having unlawful carnal knowledge of a female </em>over the age of ten years by force <em>without the consent and against the will of the victim.\u201d </em>However, other courts have defined the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>crime in more general terms as <em>\u201cunlawful carnal knowledge of a woman without her </em>consent.\u201d Other typically required elements for common law rape were force, <em>absence of the victim\u2019s consent, </em>and penetration.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">In <em>Goldberg v. State, </em>41 Md.App. 58, 64, 395 A.2d 1213 (1979), this Court spoke to the same effect.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-7\">Prior to 1976, <em>the Maryland rape statute was primarily a sentencing law, fixing the penalties without actually defining the crime. </em>The common law definition of rape that has been applied in Maryland is: <em>\u201cthe act of a man having unlawful carnal knowledge of a female </em>over the age of ten years by <em>force without the consent and against the will of the victim.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">(Emphasis supplied). See also <em>State v. Rusk, </em>289 Md. 230, 424 A.2d 720 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-9\">Basically, the underlying crimes, particularly rape, were substantively unchanged by the codification. The new statutes, to be sure, provided some precise definitions, a process which at the earlier common law would have been left to judicial interpretation. Section 3-301, providing a number of definitions, however, did not undertake to define the word \u201cconsent\u201d or the phrase \u201cwithout the consent of the other.\u201d What is pertinent in such a case of non-statutory definition is \u00a7 3-302, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-10\">In this subtitle <em>an undefined word or phrase that describes an element of common-law rape retains its judicially determined meaning, </em>except to the extent it is expressly or impliedly changed in this subtitle.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b447-11\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-12\">The appellant\u2019s specific contention is that his conviction for rape was necessarily erroneous because of \u201cthe trial judge\u2019s erroneous belief that lack of consent was not a required element of these offenses in this case.\u201d That is a bold charge and we do not remotely find any merit in it. It may nonetheless be a profitable exercise to figure out precisely how the appellant could have arrived at such a conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>In the course of closing argument in this non jury trial, Judge Groton, in various exchanges with counsel, made it unmistakably clear that his specific finding was that the victim was \u201cphysically helpless\u201d by virtue of \u201cbeing asleep.\u201d \u201cShe was asleep when he began.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m basing my decision on the fact that she was asleep.\u201d \u201c[WJhen the sexual intercourse occurred ... when it started, she was asleep.\u201d The judge and both of the lawyers were walking through the reviewing process together, looking at all of the statutory provisions and opining as to which modalities fit the case and which did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">In one exchange, during closing argument, between defense counsel and Judge Groton, the discussion focused in on which of \u00a7 3-304\u2019s (the second-degree rape statute) five modalities for establishing non-consent would best fit the facts of this case. Subsection (a)(3) could immediately be eliminated as inapplicable, dealing with a victim \u201cunder the age of 14 years.\u201d The first of subsection (a)(2)\u2019s three victim characterizations\u2014 that of being a \u201cmentally defective individual\u201d\u2014was also, by definition, eliminated. Three plausibly eligible modalities remained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-6\">[1.] (a)(1) by force, or the threat of force, without the consent of the other;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-7\">[2.] (a)(2) if the victim is ... a mentally incapacitated individual;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-8\">[3.] (a)(2) if the victim is ... a physically helpless individual[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b448-9\">The discussion involved a comparison of those three closely related situations, all producing a functionally similar result, to wit, the absence of consent. We note again that these are not three different crimes. They are simply three different but closely related modalities for committing the same crime. The court was discussing the statutory definition of second-degree rape. Specifically, the court was contrasting (a)(1) with the special conditions or statuses of a victim dealt with in (a)(2).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-10\">[Section] 3-304 is rape in the second degree: A person may not engage in vaginal intercourse with another, number <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>one\u2014a, number one, <em>by force, or threat of force, without the consent of the other.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-4\"><em>Then you go on to number two: If the victim </em>is mental<em>ly\u2014is a mentally defective individual, a mentally incapacitated individual, or a physically helpless individual, </em>and the person performing the act knows or reasonably should know that the victim is <em>mentally defective, which we don\u2019t have, </em>mentally incapacitated or physically helpless.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-5\">And <em>what I\u2019m saying is, as to subsection 2, </em>mentally incapacitated or physically helpless, if, in <em>fact\u2014my interpretation is that sleep would cause a person to be mentally incapacitated or physically helpless, </em>and, therefore, <em>he\u2019s in violation of (a)(2), having nothing to do with consent.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"ALQ\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">\u201c... having nothing to do with consent.\u201d Those are, alas, six unfortunate words\u2014but unfortunate only in the sense that they have generated such perplexing appellate mischief. There was nothing wrong with the verdict. Judge Groton found, with solid support in the evidence, that the victim was asleep when the appellant engaged in sexual intercourse with her. As will be discussed <em>infra, </em>to be asleep is <em>ipso facto </em>to be \u201cphysically helpless.\u201d In assessing sexual intercourse with a physically helpless individual, the absence of consent is automatic, as a matter of law, and does not have to be redundantly proved a second time over. The appellant does not challenge the efficacy of the evidence to support the verdict. The evidence established that the appellant engaged in sexual intercourse with the victim without her consent. That is what the judge found the appellant guilty of having done. The appellant complains only about the words the judge used in discussing the crime. Due process requires that the element of lack of consent actually be proved. It is not concerned with how the process of proving it is articulated. The appellant essentially is complaining that the judge did not articulate his reasoning more artfully.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">When a judge renders a verdict in a bench trial, it is not like taking a guilty plea or taking a waiver of a jury trial. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>There are no prescribed drills that the judge must perform on the face of the record. On review, we are concerned with what the judge actually did. We are not obsessed with the words he used to describe what he did. Due process requires that the element of lack of consent actually be proved by legally sufficient evidence. It is not concerned with how the process of proving it is articulated.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">Even in terms of the words used, moreover, the appellant\u2019s argument collapses once we take a healthy step back and look at the totality of the context in which the words were uttered. The appellant has grabbed six words out of a larger context and has ignored the context. The context was a discussion between court and counsel that had nothing to do with whether the victim had somehow consented to sexual intercourse with the appellant. The discussion concerned only the academic problem of selecting the most apt of the three possible modalities. Judge Groton specifically was contrasting subsection (a)(1) with subsection (a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">Subsection (a)(1)\u2014\u201cby force, or the threat of force, without consent of the other\u201d\u2014deals with an act of sexual intercourse committed on a victim who is both conscious and competent. Such a victim must make a choice: \u2018Tes, I will\u201d or \u201cNo, I won\u2019t.\u201d The very reason that the elements of \u201cforce\u201d or \u201cthreat of force\u201d are a part of (a)(1), but not a part of (a)(2) or (a)(3), is that in the case of a conscious and competent victim, mere passivity on the victim\u2019s part will not establish the absence of consent. The law looks for express negation or implicit negation as evidenced by some degree of physical resistance or an explanation of why the will to resist was overcome by force or fear of harm. That is the lesson of such cases as <em>Hazel v. State, </em>221 Md. 464, 157 A.2d 922 (1960), and <em>State v. Rusk, </em>289 Md. 230, 424 A.2d 720 (1981). The entire factual controversy over degree of resistance is something that arises under (a)(1) but that the court does not have to bother with under (a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">When (a)(2) or (a)(3) deal with legally incompetent or unconscious victims, on the other hand, the lack of consent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>does not have to be established independently by showing either resistance or fear of resistance but is automatically established, as a matter of law, by the status of the victim. This is a significant evidentiary difference when the prosecutor sets out to prove a case of rape. Must the lack of consent be proved independently or has it already been proved automatically by virtue of the State\u2019s having proved something else which is the equivalent of lack of consent?</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">Under (a)(2), in contrast to (a)(1), a victim who is \u201cmentally defective,\u201d \u201cmentally incapacitated,\u201d or \u201cphysically helpless\u201d need not establish the lack of consent by resisting. To that not insignificant extent, (a)(2), indeed, has \u201cnothing to do with consent.\u201d The proof of lack of consent has not been obviated; it has rather been finessed. This is all that Judge Groton was talking about with his six-word observation. He was referring to independent proof of lack of consent required under (a)(1) but not required under (a)(2). Under (a)(2), one does not have to prove the absence of consent independently because it has already been proved automatically. The three classes of victim dealt with in (a)(2) are incapable of consenting. They, therefore, do not have to resist. Under (a)(1) the proof of lack of consent must be factually <em>ad hoc; </em>under (a)(2) it is categorical. That is a significant difference. The State is relieved from having to prove directly what it has already proved indirectly. Unlike the appellant, we do not look at the six-word phrase he obsesses over in a vacuum. We look at the obvious intendment of those words in full context. We hold that the Due Process Clause has not been undermined and the convictions need not be reversed because of any failure of proof of the lack of consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">A Reflection</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">As we emerge from what seems to have been more of a Platonic dialogue than a measurement of legal sufficiency, it occurs to us that we have been presiding over a furious battle over nothing but the choice of words. Appellant\u2019s counsel and the trial court at times used the same words, but in different ways, and they ended up talking across each other. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>problem was with how they talked about the \u201clack of consent.\u201d In its simplest conceptualization, it is a binary or dualistic choice between \u201cYes, I will\u201d or \u201cNo, I won\u2019t.\u201d The proof of such a simple choice is subject to the normal vicissitudes of production and persuasion. The complicating factor, of course, is that the lack of consent embraces not only the obvious negative choice but the more elusive and less obvious failure to choose, in the case of rape, because of the inability or incompetence to choose. This latter aspect of lack of consent is proved in a very different way, automatically by virtue of having proved something else.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">When the judge said that subsection (a)(2) did not involve the lack of consent, he meant only that proof under (a)(2) did not involve a factual issue of the victim making a binary choice between \u201cYes, I will\u201d and \u201cNo, I won\u2019t.\u201d Lack of consent may mean not only a negative response but also a non-response, and the two are proved in different ways. Under (a)(2) consent does not have to be proved independently because it is implicit in the (a)(2) conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">Defense counsel now argues, however, that the judge erroneously ruled that the crime of rape does not have as one of its elements the absence of consent. In reality, the two were simply using the same words to mean different things, one of them referring to the very existence of non-consent while the other was referring only to the method of proving nonconsent. It confirms our long-standing belief that a large percentage of legal problems are simply linguistic problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">Extending the Rationale</p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">The appellant has actually raised this contention charging that the trial judge erroneously failed to appreciate the need for a finding of lack of consent and, therefore, erroneously failed to find the lack of consent with respect to the second-degree sexual offense and the third-degree sexual offense as well as with respect to the second-degree rape. Our answer to the contention in these broader applications, as well as our analysis arriving at our answer, is exactly the same in the cases of a second-degree sexual offense and a third-degree sexual offense as it is in the case of second-degree rape.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>Just as second-degree rape distinguishes between the conscious and competent victim in \u00a7 3-304(a)(1), where lack of consent had to be established as a matter of fact, and the unconscious or legally incompetent victim in \u00a7 3-304(a)(2), where proof of the very status of the victim establishes lack of consent as a matter of law, a second-degree sexual offense makes the same verbatim distinction as it distinguishes \u00a7 3-306(a)(1) from \u00a7 3-306(a)(2). The only distinction between the two crimes is the distinction between a \u201csexual act\u201d and \u201cvaginal intercourse.\u201d Their respective modalities for finding non-consent are the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">In not quite so verbatim terms, a third-degree sexual offense distinguishes between the conscious and competent victim in \u00a7 3-307(a)(1) and the unconscious or legally incompetent victim in \u00a7 3-307(a)(2). Only in the first case must the lack of consent be directly proved as a matter of fact. In the second case, lack of consent is once again necessarily implicit in the very status of the victim. It does not have to be proved directly not because it is not required but only because it is implicit in the victim\u2019s condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">A Sleeping Victim Is A Non-Consenting Victim</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">As the best explanation of why a sleeping victim is necessarily a rape victim, Judge Groton settled on \u00a7 3-304(a)(2) and, within that subsection, on a \u201cphysically helpless individual.\u201d Section 3-301(d) defines such a victim.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-8\">(d) <em>Physically helpless individual.\u2014\u201cPhysically helpless individual\u201d means an individual who:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-10\">(1) <em>is unconscious; </em>or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-11\">(2) (i) does not consent to vaginal intercourse, a sexual act, or sexual contact; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-12\">(ii) is physically unable to resist, or communicate unwillingness to submit to, vaginal intercourse, a sexual act, or sexual contact.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-13\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-14\">The common law of rape has long recognized that engaging in sexual intercourse with a woman who is asleep is a form of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>rape. In Lewis Hochheimer, <em>Crimes And Criminal Procedures, </em>\u00a7 429 \u201cRape,\u201d p. 456 (2d ed. 1904), it is said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-5\"><em>Carnal knowledge of a woman is said to be by force and against her consent, if, </em>to the knowledge of the accused, <em>she was </em>in such an imbecile or idiotic state of mind, or so drunken, <em>or unconscious from sleep, </em>or affected by drugs, <em>as to be unable to assent.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">In 3 <em>Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law, </em>\u00a7 289 \u201cIncapacity to Consent,\u201d p. 38 (Charles E. Torcia, ed., 14th ed. 1980), it is similarly stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-8\"><em>A female is </em>obviously <em>incapable of consenting </em>to sexual intercourse <em>when </em>she is <em>unconscious or asleep.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-9\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-10\">Although dealing with incompetence due to drunkenness rather than to being asleep, this Court did hold in <em>Cranford v. State, </em>36 Md.App. 393, 400, 373 A.2d 984 (1977):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-11\">It is well settled that unlawful sexual intercourse with a female person without her consent constitutes the common-law felony of rape. It is also settled that unlawful <em>sexual intercourse with a woman who is incapable of giving or withholding consent is rape.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-12\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-13\">With respect to the absence of consent by a sleeping victim, the national case law is in essential agreement. <em>King v. State, </em>978 P.2d 1278, 1280 (Alaska App.1999); <em>Harvey v. State, </em>53 Ark. 425, 14 S.W. 645, 646 (1890); <em>Davis v. State, </em>538 So.2d 515, 516 (Fla.App.1989); <em>Brown v.

Commonwealth, </em>155 S.W.3d 727, 731 (Ky.App.2004) (\u201cAlthough sleep may not always be a fully unconscious condition, \u2018[i]t is axiomatic that sleep is the antithesis of awareness. It is that periodic state of rest in which consciousness is suspended.

Rush, </em>278 N.J.Super. 44, 650 A.2d 373, 375-76 (App.Div.1994) (\u201c[A] person who is actually asleep is incapable of fleeing or communicating unwillingness to act.\u201d); <em>State v.

Puapuaga, </em>54 Wash.App. 857, 776 P.2d 170, 172 (1989) (\u201cThe state of sleep seems to be universally understood as unconsciousness or physical inability to communicate unwillingness.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">Sleep As A Variety Of Unconsciousness</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">The appellant seeks to parry \u00a7 3-301(d)\u2019s definition of a \u201cphysically helpless individual\u201d as \u201can individual who is unconscious\u201d by pointing to an arguably hypertechnical distinction between unconsciousness and sleep. As far as the absence of consent that is implied in the case of a victim who is unable to choose between consenting and not consenting, however, it is a distinction without a difference. Unconsciousness is a broader category than sleep, but it includes sleep. One might well be unconscious for reasons other than being asleep: a brain tumor, a severe concussion, extreme intoxication, anesthesia, narcolepsy, or a fainting spell. The broader category nonetheless includes the state of being asleep. For the appellant to assert that all who are unconscious are not asleep by no means yields his desired conclusion that all who are asleep are not unconscious. A sleeping victim is not excluded from \u00a7 3-301 (d)\u2019s definition of a \u201cphysically helpless individual.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">In his reply brief, the appellant attempts to draw a critical distinction between unconsciousness and sleep.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-7\">The State\u2019s attempt, on appeal, to equate being asleep with being unconscious fails to acknowledge a significant differ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>ence between the two. <em>A person who is unconscious is unable to respond to stimuli like sound or touch such as being shaken; a person who is asleep will respond to such sensory stimuli. </em>See, e.g., http://nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ ency/article/000022.htm (\u201cBeing asleep is not the same thing as being unconscious. <em>A sleeping person will respond to loud noises or gentle shaking\u2014an unconscious person will not.\u201d). </em>A person who is unconscious cannot consent; a person who is asleep can wake up and consent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">Section 3-304(a)(2)\u2019s protection of one who is a \u201cphysically helpless individual\u201d by virtue of being \u201cunconscious\u201d applies to all forms of unconsciousness, including sleep. The critical common denominator is that such an individual is unaware of what is then happening or is about to happen sexually. Such an individual, while in that state of unconsciousness, is unable to make a choice between consenting and not consenting. To draw a meaningless distinction between how difficult or easy it might be to rouse the victim from the state of unconsciousness after the criminal sexual violation had already occurred is beside the point. The critical moment of consent <em>vel non </em>occurs before the victim is awake, not afterward.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">To say, as the appellant does, that one who is merely asleep, as opposed to one who might be unconscious for other reasons, can more easily \u201cwake up and consent\u201d has no remote pertinence to anything we have been talking about. What matters is that one cannot consent before waking up. Being asleep qualifies as an instance of being unconscious.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">Were the Verdicts Inconsistent?</p>\n<p id=\"b456-8\">In this non jury trial, Judge Groton rendered five verdicts, four of guilty and one of not guilty. In his second contention, the appellant claims that the mixed verdicts of guilty and not guilty were fatally inconsistent.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-9\">The appellant was convicted of second-degree rape. In the most simplistic terms, that is an act of vaginal intercourse with a woman without her consent. The appellant was, secondly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>convicted of a second-degree sexual offense. In simplistic terms, that is a sexual act (in this case, fellatio), without the victim\u2019s consent. The appellant was, thirdly, convicted of a third-degree sexual offense. Simplistically, that is sexual contact with another person without that person\u2019s consent. The absence of consent, in various permutations, was a factor in all three of those crimes.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">The appellant was, by contrast, acquitted of a sexual offense in the fourth degree. In simplistic terms, that is sexual contact with another without that person\u2019s consent. The appellant contends that the acquittal of the fourth-degree sexual offense necessarily established that the State had failed to prove the absence of consent on the part of the victim and that such a finding by the trial judge was incompatible with the three convictions, in each of which the absence of consent was a necessary element.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">As we address this claim of verdict inconsistency, some legal background is necessary to establish an intelligible context.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">A Mere Secondary Contention of Awesome Complexity</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">Although a vexing problem throughout the common law world, inconsistency between verdicts is not a matter of constitutional dimension. <em>United States v. Powell, </em>469 U.S. 57, 65, 105 S.Ct. 471, 83 L.Ed.2d 461 (1984); <em>Harris v. Rivera, </em>454 U.S. 339, 344-48, 102 S.Ct. 460, 70 L.Ed.2d 530 (1981). At least since 1932, however, the overwhelming majority of American states has followed the lead of the Supreme Court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">There is a wide variety of possible inconsistencies. There is the relatively rare problem of an inconsistency between two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>convictions. There is the far more prevalent problem of an inconsistency between a conviction and an acquittal. There may be an inconsistency between verdicts on different counts in the same indictment or on different indictments against a single defendant in a single trial. Although a rarer occurrence in the case law, there may be inconsistent verdicts against different co-defendants in a trial against multiple defendants. There is a vast difference between inconsistent verdicts rendered by a judge in a non jury trial and inconsistent verdicts rendered by a jury. There is also the little explored rarity of inconsistency between one verdict rendered by a jury and another verdict rendered by a judge in a mixed judge/jury trial. See, for instance, <em>Galloway v. State, </em>371 Md. 379, 401, 809 A.2d 653 (2002). There is a significant difference (not touched on in this opinion) between inconsistent verdicts in civil trials and inconsistent verdicts in criminal trials. There is also a difference enjoying more recent attention between what, in Maryland at least, is referred to as legal inconsistency and what is referred to as factual inconsistency. In short, inconsistency between verdicts is by no means a simple or one-dimensional problem. It is a collection of what can be very different problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">\u201cAn Ounce of Prevention ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">When the State unexpectedly loses a hard earned victory at the eleventh hour, the most wasteful and the most unnecessary cause is that of inconsistency between the verdicts. In the flush of apparent success at the end of a trial, it is all too easy to allow impatience and untidiness to compromise the mopping up operation. Although lesser charges may seem to be little more than superfluous clutter, every \u201ci\u201d must carefully be dotted and every \u201ct\u201d must carefully be crossed before the victory celebration is permitted to begin. Following a conviction for a greater inclusive offense, e.g., not guilty verdicts should never be rendered on lesser included offenses simply to clear the deck. If, as Emerson tells us, \u201ca foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds,\u201d a careless inconsistency is the hobgoblin of impatient minds.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>A Common Law Provenance</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">The legal rules and precepts for handling inconsistent verdicts in Maryland, as well as nationally, are of common law origin. There are neither statutes nor rules of court governing the subject. It is all a matter of slowly evolving case law. In <em>Price v. State, </em>405 Md. 10, 18, 949 A.2d 619 (2008), Judge Eldridge discussed the source of Maryland\u2019s inconsistent verdict law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-5\">In Maryland, <em>the principles </em>concerning inconsistent verdicts <em>have judicially developed over time as part of this State\u2019s common law. </em>Unlike several other jurisdictions, <em>there are no Maryland statutes </em>or <em>promulgated procedural rules which relate to inconsistent verdicts </em>generally or relate to specific types of inconsistent verdicts. Moreover, the Maryland common law principles governing inconsistent verdicts are themselves confusing and somewhat inconsistent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">Over the years, however, Maryland did to a significant extent follow the lead of the Supreme Court as inconsistent verdict law has been evolving.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-8\">Inconsistent Verdicts of Conviction</p>\n<p id=\"b459-9\">As this Court noted in <em>Tate v. State, </em>176 Md.App. 365, 382, 933 A.2d 447 (2007) <em>(\u201cTate I </em>\u201d), remanded for reconsideration in light of <em>Price v. State, </em>405 Md. 10, 949 A.2d 619 (2008), but reaffirmed by <em>Tate v. State, </em>182 Md.App. 114, 957 A.2d 640, <em>cert. denied, </em>406 Md. 747, 962 A.2d 373 (2008) <em>(\u201cTate II </em>\u201d), \u201cTraditionally, a distinction has always been made between 1) two inconsistent convictions and 2) a conviction and an inconsistent acquittal.\u201d The relatively rare problem of inconsistent convictions, whether emanating from a jury alone or from a judge alone or from a combination of the two, is a self-contained phenomenon that may here be quickly noted and conveniently set to one side. Even to discuss inconsistency between convictions when dealing with the very different problem of an inconsistency between a conviction and an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>acquittal is to compare apples with oranges, a practice sedulously to be avoided.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">Inconsistency between convictions has always been recognized as an error that calls for some sort of correction. In now fashionable Maryland terms, moreover, it is a legal inconsistency rather than a less virulent factual inconsistency. It occurs when, in a single trial, one of the convictions necessarily establishes an element which is incompatible with an element necessary to the other conviction. The two contradictory elements cannot coexist.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">A classic example of inconsistent convictions is the early Maryland case of <em>Heinze v. State, </em>184 Md. 613, 42 A.2d 128 (1945). Each of two defendants was charged with both the larceny of $20 and receiving $20 of stolen goods. Notwithstanding an ultimately unsuccessful effort by the clerk of the court to correct the jury\u2019s verdict, the actual verdict rendered by the jury foreman was that each defendant was guilty on both counts. In the days before Maryland\u2019s 1978 Consolidated Theft Law, however, a defendant could not for the same act be both a thief and a receiver of stolen goods. Although ultimately finding that the defendants, under the special circumstances of the case, had suffered no prejudice, the statement of the Court of Appeals was clear as to the legal incompatibility of the two such guilty verdicts.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-6\">It is unquestioned that <em>a finding of guilty on two inconsistent counts is invalid. </em>Thus, where a defendant is charged in one count with larceny and in another count with receiving stolen goods, and it plainly appears that the property alleged to have been stolen is that also alleged to have been received, <em>a general verdict of guilty is fatally defective, because in law a thief cannot be guilty of the crime of receiving stolen goods which he himself has stolen, </em>and a guilty receiver of stolen goods cannot himself be the thief, and hence <em>the defendant could not be guilty on both counts.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AxD\">184 Md. at 617, 42 A.2d 128 (emphasis supplied).

Caution should be employed, therefore, not to draw glib or inapt analogies between phenomena that are not analogous. Inconsistency between convictions is a subject unto itself. As was pointed out by <em>Tate I, </em>176 Md.App. at 384-85, 933 A.2d 447:</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number><em>There is an almost unbridgeable divide between the case of an inconsistency between two convictions (by judge or jury), on the one hand, and an inconsistency between a jury\u2019s conviction and a jury\u2019s acquittal, on the other hand. </em>In the case of inconsistent convictions, the fact finder has necessarily and affirmatively found two things that are unquestionably irreconcilable. There is nothing to speculate about, and such an incongruous result is flatly prohibited. As the caselaw has been pointing out for 75 years, however, <em>there are a number of plausible explanations for an apparently inconsistent acquittal by a jury and the law does not mandate a reversal based on mere speculation as to what the actual explanation may have been. In the one case, appellate review is rigid. In the other case, it is extremely indulgent.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\"><em>These two species of inconsistency are so inherently different that doctrinal cross-fertilization is problematic in the extreme. </em>Statements made in the context of inconsistent conviction cases may have no applicability at all in the very different world of an inconsistency between a jury\u2019s conviction and a jury\u2019s acquittal. <em>Pronouncements quite correctly made in the first context can be treacherous if uncritically misapplied in the second. Such a doctrinal transplant does not always take.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">Inconsistency Between A Conviction And An Acquittal</p>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">It is the inconsistency between a verdict of conviction and, on another count or indictment against the same defendant, a verdict of acquittal that has commanded the lion\u2019s share of attention. It is in this area that we draw a distinction between the sources of the inconsistent verdicts. Was the source a jury? Was the source a judge in a non jury trial? Or was the source a combination of the two in a mixed trial scenario? That third possibility we can dispose of briefly.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-9\">A Mixed Verdict By Judge and Jury</p>\n<p id=\"b462-10\">The law has traditionally been far more tolerant of inconsistent verdicts handed down by a jury than of similar inconsis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>tency at the hands of a judge alone. For all intents and purposes, inconsistent verdicts rendered by the combination of judge and jury are held to the same rigorous standard as that regulating inconsistent verdicts rendered by the judge alone. Just as the judge is required to make his verdicts logically consistent with each other, the judge is similarly required, in a mixed trial scenario, to make his verdict conform to whatever verdict the jury has rendered. The obligation to be consistent is a one-way street.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">The 4-3 decision of the Court of Appeals in <em>Galloway v. State, </em>371 Md. 379, 809 A.2d 653 (2002), is a case in point. It also illustrates why a mixed trial modality is sometimes necessary, or at least desirable. Galloway was charged in a nine-count indictment. Counts one through seven charged a number of substantive offenses. Counts eight and nine charged the possession of a firearm after having been convicted previously of a crime. Galloway expressed concern over the possible prejudicial impact on the jury of his prior criminal record, a necessary element of counts eight and nine, on the remaining seven charges. With the acquiescence of Galloway, the trial judge determined that the jury would hear evidence on and would consider only the first seven counts. The trial judge, out of the presence of the jury, would hear the evidence about the prior criminal record and would then render her own verdict on counts eight and nine.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">The surprise came at verdict time as the jury returned verdicts of not guilty on counts one through seven even as the judge found Galloway guilty on counts eight and nine. Galloway appealed those convictions on the ground that his convictions by the judge for possessing a firearm while having a criminal record were inconsistent with his acquittal by the jury on count seven on the charge of carrying a handgun. There was no question that the firearm at issue in counts eight and nine was a handgun.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">Judge Cathell\u2019s opinion for the Court of Appeals had no difficulty in finding an inconsistency.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-8\">[Tjhere is no dispute as to whether the verdicts were inconsistent. <em>They are dearly inconsistent. </em>At a given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>point in time, <em>the jury held that appellant did not possess the handgun. The trial court necessarily held that, </em>at the same given point in time, <em>appellant, </em>a felon, <em>was in possession of the same handgun.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">371 Md. at 400, 809 A.2d 653 (emphasis supplied). The holding of the Court of Appeals was clear.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-6\">It makes no difference in criminal cases what the procedure is that results in the mingling of court and jury verdicts; <em>inconsistent verdicts </em>based on identical facts, <em>are not permitted unless the inconsistency is solely a jury inconsistency.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">371 Md. at 401, 809 A.2d 653 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">Where the court is involved in any way, either in verdicts rendered by the court alone or in the combined verdicts of court and jury, inconsistent verdicts will not be permitted.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-9\">Maryland\u2019s appellate courts have disapproved inconsistent verdicts in criminal cases <em>where the inconsistency involved court action.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b464-10\">371 Md. at 400, 809 A.2d 653 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-11\">With inconsistent verdicts by a judge and jury combined being subsumed into inconsistent verdicts rendered by a judge alone, the total picture becomes a bit less cluttered. We are dealing with either 1) inconsistency by a jury or 2) inconsistency charged to a judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-12\">Inconsistent Verdicts Of Guilty And Not Guilty By A Jury</p>\n<p id=\"b464-13\">The developing law with respect to inconsistency between verdicts has been predominantly, indeed almost exclusively, concerned with a conviction and an inconsistent acquittal at the hands of a jury.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The starting point was a generally recognized common law principle that inconsistent verdicts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>would not be permitted. The entire subject of inconsistent verdicts first achieved national prominence in 1925 as federal courts, soon followed by state courts, carved out a massive exception to the former prohibition for an inconsistency between a conviction and an acquittal both rendered by a jury. Instead of being strictly forbidden, inconsistency at the hands of a jury became almost universally tolerated.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">Contrary to popular understanding, the pioneering opinion was not that of Justice Holmes in <em>Dunn v. United States, </em>284 U.S. 390, 52 S.Ct. 189, 76 L.Ed. 356 (1932) in 1932, but that of Judge Learned Hand<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> for the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in <em>Steckler v. United States, </em>7 F.2d 59 (2d Cir.1925), in 1925. The Second Circuit was confronted with an undeniable inconsistency in the jury\u2019s verdicts.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-6\">There is a plain inconsistency in saying that the liquors were kept for sale, and in saying that the shop in which they were was not one in which the same liquors were kept for sale. <em>We cannot, </em>therefore, <em>avoid the question whether this inconsistency invalidated the verdict of guilty </em>on count 2.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A3q\">7 F.2d at 60 (emphasis supplied). Judge Hand recognized, moreover, that the court was plowing new ground.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-7\">No doubt <em>it has generally been assumed that, if the verdict was rationally inconsistent, the conviction ought not to stand, </em>and <em>probably that was the common law, though it is hard to find a case squarely so holding.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b465-8\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-9\">Judge Hand explained that the pertinent question in cases in which inconsistent verdicts of guilty and not guilty are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>returned is whether, with respect to the guilty verdict, the jury was truly persuaded of the defendant\u2019s guilt. Because the acquittal on one charge may well have been based upon a desire to guarantee lenity or upon a compromise to achieve jury unanimity, the not guilty verdicts do not cast sufficient doubt upon the jury\u2019s return of the guilty verdict to justify overturning it on mere speculation.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-5\">The most that can be said in such cases is that the verdict shows that either in the acquittal or the conviction the jury did not speak their real conclusions, but <em>that does not show that they were not convinced of the defendant\u2019s guilt. We interpret the acquittal as no more than their assumption of a power which they had no right to exercise, but to which they were disposed through lenity.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-6\">That the conviction may have been the result of some compromise is, of course, <em>possible; </em>but to consider so is to consider too curiously, unless all verdicts are to be upset on speculation. <em>That it represented their deliberate judgment seems to us beyond any reasonable doubt.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b466-7\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">It was seven years later that Justice Holmes bestowed the blessing of the Supreme Court on <em>Steckler </em>with his much heralded opinion in <em>Dunn v. United States, supra. </em>It was <em>Dunn </em>that gave the tolerance of jury inconsistency the prominence it has enjoyed for the last eighty-two years. A jury had convicted Dunn of maintaining a common nuisance by keeping intoxicating liquor for sale at a specified place. The same jury, however, had also acquitted Dunn of both 1) the unlawful possession of the intoxicating liquor and 2) the unlawful sale of said liquor. Dunn contended that the conviction could not stand in light of the inconsistent acquittals. Justice Holmes\u2019s opinion was brief but certain.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-9\"><em>Consistency in the verdict is not necessary. </em>Each count in an indictment is regarded as if it was a separate indictment. If separate indictments had been presented against the defendant for possession and for maintenance of a nuisance, and had been separately tried, the same evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>being offered in support of each, an acquittal on one could not be pleaded as <em>res judicata </em>of the other. Where the offenses are separately charged in the counts of a single indictment the same rule must hold.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">284 U.S. at 393, 52 S.Ct. 189 (emphasis supplied). After quoting with approval from Judge Hand\u2019s opinion in <em>Steckler, </em>Justice Holmes concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-6\">That the verdict may have been the result of compromise, or of a mistake on the part of the jury, is possible. But verdicts cannot be upset by speculation or inquiry into such matters.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">284 U.S. at 394, 52 S.Ct. 189.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">Lest any suspect that <em>Dunn v. United States </em>is now somehow superannuated, the 1984 opinion of a unanimous Supreme Court in <em>United States v. Powell, </em>469 U.S. 57, 105 S.Ct. 471, 83 L.Ed.2d 461, was a rousing re-endorsement. Chief Justice Rehnquist\u2019s opinion for the Court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-9\">Fifty-three years later <em>most of what Justice Holmes so succinctly stated retains its force. </em>Indeed, although not expressly reaffirming <em>Dunn this Court has on numerous occasions alluded to its rule as an established principle. </em>[The Court cited and briefly discussed <em>United States v. Dotterweich, </em>320 U.S. 277, 279, 64 S.Ct. 134, 135, 88 L.Ed. 48 (1943), and <em>Harris v. Rivera, </em>454 U.S. 339, 102 S.Ct. 460, 70 L.Ed.2d 530 (1981).]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-10\">These decisions indicate that this is not a case where a once-established principle has gradually been eroded by subsequent opinions of this Court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b467-11\">469 U.S. at 63, 105 S.Ct. 471 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-12\">The Court\u2019s opinion explained why inconsistent jury verdicts of conviction and acquittal are tolerated.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-13\"><em>The rule that the defendant may not upset such a verdict embodies a prudent acknowledgment of a number of factors. </em>First, as the above quote suggests, inconsistent verdicts\u2014even verdicts that acquit on a predicate offense while convicting on the compound offense\u2014should not necessarily be interpreted as a windfall to the Government at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>defendant\u2019s expense. <em>It is equally possible that the jury, convinced of guilt, properly reached its conclusion on the compound offense, and then through mistake, compromise, or lenity, arrived at an inconsistent conclusion on the lesser offense. </em>But in such situations the Government has no recourse if it wishes to correct the jury\u2019s error; the Government is precluded from appealing or otherwise upsetting such an acquittal by the Constitution\u2019s Double Jeopardy Clause.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">469 U.S. at 65, 105 S.Ct. 471 (emphasis supplied). The opinion explained that lenity is frequently the explanation for a jury\u2019s apparent inconsistency.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-6\"><em>Dunn </em>has been explained by both courts and commentators as <em>a recognition of the jury\u2019s historic junction, in criminal trials, as a check against arbitrary or oppressive exercises of power by the Executive Branch.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-7\"><em>... </em>The fact that <em>the inconsistency may be the result of lenity, </em>coupled with the Government\u2019s inability to invoke review, <em>suggests that inconsistent verdicts should not be reviewable.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">469 U.S. at 65-66, 105 S.Ct. 471 (emphasis supplied). As we earlier noted, the <em>Dunn-Steckler </em>acceptance of jury inconsistency has been followed by thirty-eight states.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b468-9\">From the first occasion on which it addressed the question of an inconsistency between a jury conviction and a jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>acquittal, Maryland regularly endorsed the rule of <em>Dunn. </em>In <em>Leet v. State, </em>203 Md. 285, 293, 100 A.2d 789 (1953), Chief Judge Sobeloff quoted with approval from both <em>Dunn </em>and <em>Steckler. </em>The conclusion of the Court of Appeals was brief but sure.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-5\">If we nevertheless assume that there was an inconsistency, the result is not necessarily to reverse the conviction. <em>While it is true that a finding of guilt on two inconsistent counts will be declared invalid in Maryland, it does not follow that a conviction on one count may not stand because of an inconsistent acquittal on another count.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AEJ3\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">For the next fifty-five years, Maryland continued to follow <em>Dunn v. United States. Williams v. State, </em>204 Md. 55, 64, 102 A.2d 714 (1954); <em>Ledbetter v. State, </em>224 Md. 271, 273-74, 167 A.2d 596 (1961); <em>Ford v. State, </em>274 Md. 546, 552-53, 337 A.2d 81 (1975); <em>Mack v. State, </em>300 Md. 583, 597, 479 A.2d 1344 (1984); <em>Hudson v. State, </em>152 Md.App. 488, 513, 832 A.2d 834 (2003); <em>Price v. State, </em>172 Md.App. 363, 388-90, 915 A.2d 432 (2007), <em>rev\u2019d, </em>405 Md. 10, 949 A.2d 619 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">Maryland Changes Course</p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">For Marylanders a sea change occurred in 2008. In <em>Price v. State, </em>172 Md.App. 363, 915 A.2d 432 (2007), the Court of Special Appeals had continued to follow the <em>Steckler-DunnPowell </em>tolerance of inconsistency between verdicts of conviction and acquittal in a jury trial, the position that Maryland had consistently taken since <em>Leet v. State, supra, </em>in 1953. In its <em>Price v. State, </em>405 Md. 10, 949 A.2d 619 (2008) (hereinafter <em>\u201cPrice </em>\u201d), the Court of Appeals reversed course and held that inconsistent verdicts of conviction and acquittal will no longer be tolerated in jury trials.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-9\">Judge Eldridge\u2019s opinion for the <em>Price </em>majority pointed out that consistency has always been demanded between verdicts rendered by a judge alone. <em>State v. Williams, </em>397 Md. 172, 189-90, 916 A.2d 294 (2007). The opinion further pointed out that consistency had similarly been demanded between a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>verdict rendered by a jury and a verdict rendered by a judge in a hybrid judge/jury trial. <em>Galloway v. State, </em>371 Md. at 401, 809 A.2d 653. Although referring to a totally different phenomenon and not to an inconsistency between a conviction and an acquittal, the <em>Price </em>opinion also noted that consistency has regularly been demanded between verdicts of conviction. <em>Shell v. State, </em>307 Md. 46, 55, 512 A.2d 358 (1986). The opinion concluded by observing that consistency is now demanded between verdicts (by judge or jury) in civil cases. <em>Southern Management v. Taha, </em>378 Md. 461, 467, 836 A.2d 627 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\"><em>Price\u2019s </em>thesis was that consistency law itself should at least aspire to consistency. Accordingly, it did, as Maryland joined Alaska<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and Florida<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> in seeming to reject totally the <em>StecklerDunn-Powell </em>rationale as to why jury inconsistency should be tolerated (actually, <em>Price </em>did not effect a total rejection of that tolerance, as we shall examine, infra). The majority opinion\u2019s conclusion in <em>Price </em>appeared to be a sweeping one.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-6\">Accordingly, with regard to the instant case, similarly situated cases on direct appeal where the issue was preserved, and verdicts in criminal jury trials rendered after the date of our opinion in this case, <em>inconsistent verdicts shall no longer be allowed.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">405 Md. at 29, 949 A.2d 619 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">Interestingly, the <em>Price </em>majority opinion neither mentioned <em>nor </em>recognized any possible distinction between legal inconsistency and factual inconsistency. Neither did it mention any requirement with respect to preservation of the issue for appellate review. In short order, it became clear that the major significance of the <em>Price </em>decision lay in the concurring opinion of Judge Harrell. That concurrence began by noting, \u201cThe Majority opinion ... does not penetrate further into the jurisprudential wilderness.\u201d 405 Md. at 35, 949 A.2d 619. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>Where the majority opinion did not penetrate, however, the concurring opinion did.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">Legal Versus Factual Inconsistency</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">In the universe of inconsistent verdicts, the percentage of factually inconsistent verdicts is far greater than is the percentage of legally inconsistent verdicts. As far as the prosecution is concerned, the opening words of Judge Harrell\u2019s concurrence removed 75-80% of <em>Price\u2019s </em>sting.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-7\">I think it important to note explicitly that <em>the Majority\u2019s holding applies only to \u201clegally inconsistent\u201d verdicts, not \u201cfactually inconsistent\u201d verdicts. </em>The Court should continue to recognize factually or \u201clogically\u201d inconsistent verdicts rendered by juries in criminal cases.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">405 Md. at 35, 949 A.2d 619 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-9\">The intolerance of jury inconsistency commanded by <em>Price </em>would, should the concurrence prevail, apply to a relatively small fraction of jury inconsistencies. A lion\u2019s share of the <em>Steckler-Dunn-Powell </em>tolerance of jury inconsistencies, therefore, would still abide.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-10\">The distinction between legal inconsistency and factual inconsistency, moreover, is essentially a new entry in the legal lexicon. One can apply the new distinction to the older cases, in state and out, and distinguish legal inconsistencies from factual ones, but the older cases did not consciously and articulately apply these characterizing tags. The academic literature, moreover, is also almost completely silent as to the legal-factual distinction which has now become a critical criterion in Maryland.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>The difficulty is that although the respective heartlands can be cleanly distinguished from each other, the borderline between legal inconsistency and factual inconsistency is often a blurred boundary. The concurring opinion offered the following distinction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-5\">A factually inconsistent verdict is one where a jury renders \u201cdifferent verdicts on crimes with distinct elements when there was only one set of proof at a given trial, which makes the verdict illogical.\u201d <em>The feature distinguishing a factually inconsistent verdict from a legally inconsistent verdict is that a factually inconsistent verdict is merely illogical.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">405 Md. at 35, 949 A.2d 619 (emphasis supplied). The concurring opinion also offered an illustrative example:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-7\">Assume a legally intoxicated or otherwise reckless driver causes a head-on collision, killing on impact the driver and passenger of the other car. The intoxicated driver is charged \"with two counts of vehicular homicide. The jury convicts the defendant of vehicular homicide as to the death of the driver of the other car, but finds the defendant not guilty of the same crime with regard to the death of the passenger. <em>Such a result would constitute factually inconsistent verdicts.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">405 Md. at 35-36, 949 A.2d 619 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-9\">Mere logical inconsistency is only factual inconsistency and will not condemn a jury\u2019s verdicts as fatally inconsistent.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-10\">The verdicts in the present case also contain a factual inconsistency. Price was acquitted of being a felon in possession of a handgun, but convicted of possessing a handgun in the course of drug trafficking. There was no dispute at trial as to Price\u2019s prior felony convictions. Therefore, <em>it is illogical for the jury to find that Price is guilty of possessing a firearm in the course of drug trafficking without possessing a firearm as a convicted felon. Despite the illogical verdict, this does not rise to the level of a legally inconsistent verdict.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b473-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>405 Md. at 37, 949 A.2d 619 (emphasis supplied).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\">A legal inconsistency, by contrast, must announce squarely contrary decisions with respect to actual elements of the two offenses. This does not mean contrary findings of fact which have logical implications with respect to elements. Every factual inconsistency necessarily has implications with respect to elements.

Judge Battaglia and Judge Wilner joined Judge Harrell in that part of the concurring opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">The reason for this iron-clad preservation requirement is clear. When inconsistent jury verdicts of conviction and acquittal are rendered, it is more frequently the acquittal that is at odds with the true belief of the jurors than it is the conviction. The verdict of acquittal is frequently returned in the interest of lenity and actually is a windfall for the defendant. It would be with exceeding ill grace that a defendant would accept the benefit of a jury\u2019s incongruous acquittal even while condemning the incongruous conviction, when logically the two should rise or fall together. The concurring opinion pointed out why a defendant might be well advised to keep silent rather than risk losing his incongruous acquittal.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-7\">In fact, quite often a defendant\u2019s optimal choice will be to remain silent, thus waiving his challenge to the inconsistent verdicts and accepting the conviction that may be inconsistent. <em>A defendant, aware of his or her guilt, </em>or the overwhelming evidence of guilt, of all of the crimes of which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>he or she stands charged, <em>may choose to accept the jury\u2019s lenity. A defendant may be wise to accept the inconsistent conviction </em>and accompanying sentence, <em>rather than look a gift horse in the mouth.

The <em>McNeal </em>opinion agreed that there was, indeed, an inconsistency, but noted that it was only a factual inconsistency and not a legal one.

State </em>is where the Maryland law now is with respect to inconsistent verdicts of conviction and acquittal at the hands of a jury. We should take note, however, of some modest fine-tuning by <em>Teixeira v. State, </em>213 Md.App. 664, 75 A.3d 371 (2013). The fine-tuning has been in two regards. <em>Teixeira, </em>by graphic example, makes more clearly marked than it theretofore had been the fine line separating legally inconsistent verdicts from factually inconsistent verdicts. <em>Teixeira </em>also explores a procedural nuance never before considered as it identifies the precise moment until which a defense objection to a jury\u2019s inconsistent verdicts may still be timely made.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-10\">A. Legal Versus Factual Inconsistency</p>\n<p id=\"b479-11\">In certain cases, there is, indeed, a very thin and nuanced line between legal inconsistency and factual inconsistency. The definitions that have been tendered, moreover, have been less than models of clarity. The decision in <em>Teixeira, </em>howev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>er, makes transparently clear the precise dividing line that had theretofore been a bit blurry.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">If there is any discernible pattern to jury inconsistency cases, it seems that a significant percentage of them involve unexpected acquittals on lesser charges involving the use or possession of weapons. It is as if the jurors were disdainful or at least neglectful if not of lesser charges generally, then of lesser charges involving weapons specifically.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">The verdicts in <em>Teixeira </em>seemed to follow such a pattern. The jury had no trouble convicting Teixeira of all substantive criminal offenses\u2014armed carjacking, simple carjacking, conspiracy to commit armed carjacking, armed robbery, simple robbery, unauthorized removal of property, first-degree assault, and second-degree assault. Notwithstanding the clear evidence that Teixeira had used a handgun in perpetrating the offenses, the jury for no apparent reason acquitted Teixeira of both 1) the use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence and 2) wearing, carrying, and transporting a handgun. On appeal, 213 Md.App. at 668, 75 A.3d 371 \u201cTeixeira main-tainted] that the jury\u2019s acquittal of the handgun charges renders inconsistent those guilty verdicts on charges that were based on the use or possession of a dangerous weapon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">This Court held that the verdicts were clearly inconsistent. As we observed, 213 Md.App. at 681, 75 A.3d 371 \u201cwhat we are left with are verdicts that are factually inconsistent for reasons known but to the jury.\u201d The issue before this Court was that of whether the verdicts were only factually inconsistent, which under <em>McNeal </em>would not require reversal, or were legally inconsistent, which under Price would necessitate reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-8\">In identifying that line of demarcation, <em>Teixeira, </em>213 Md. App. at 680, 75 A.3d 371 quoted from <em>McNeal, </em>426 Md. at 458, 44 A.3d 982 where it had in turn quoted with approval from <em>People v. Muhammad, </em>17 N.Y.3d 532, 935 N.Y.S.2d 526, 959 N.E.2d 463, 467 (2011), as the New York Court of Appeals explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>\u201c[A] verdict as to a particular count shall be set aside\u201d as repugnant [inconsistent] \u201conly <em>when it is inherently inconsistent when viewed in light of the elements of each crime </em>as charged to the jury\u201d without regard to the accuracy of those instructions. <em>The underlying purpose </em>of this rule is to <em>ensure that an individual is not convicted of \u201ca crime on which the jury has actually found that the defendant did not commit an essential element, </em>whether it be one element or all.\u201d <em>A person cannot be convicted of a crime if a jury has necessarily decided that one of the essential elements was not proven beyond a reasonable doubt.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">In making the distinction between legal inconsistency and factual inconsistency, the focus is not on inconsistent factual findings but on inconsistent elements. Sets of elements can be compared to each other in a vacuum without any reference to the actual facts in the case. This Court took that approach in <em>Teixeira.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">In comparing the convictions with the acquittals, we noted that the critical element in the two crimes resulting in acquittal was a handgun. The convictions for armed carjacking and armed robbery, on the other hand, did not involve, as an element, the use of a handgun. They were based on a different element\u2014the use of a deadly weapon generally. As we observed, 213 Md.App. at 681, 75 A.3d 371 \u201cNeither offense requires the use of a \u2018handgun.\u2019 \u201d Although the only factual evidence involved a handgun, a handgun was not an actual element of the crimes resulting in convictions. With respect to mere factual inconsistency, we concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-8\">The jury\u2019s choices in this regard, while a source of wonder, are beyond appellate scrutiny.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-9\">213 Md.App. at 683, 75 A.3d 371.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-10\">B. Closely Calibrating the Crack of Doom</p>\n<p id=\"b481-11\"><em>Teixeira </em>discovered a nuance that we had never thought about before. In announcing the rule of law that a defendant must make timely objection to inconsistent jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>verdicts in order to preserve the issue for appellate review, the case law has used various verbal formulations. The concurring opinion in <em>Price </em>at one point said that \u201ca defendant must note his objection to allegedly inconsistent verdicts <em>prior to the verdicts becoming final and the discharge of the jury.\u201d </em>405 Md. at 42, 949 A.2d 619 (emphasis supplied). This Court in <em>Tate II, </em>182 Md.App. at 182, 957 A.2d 640, characterized the <em>Price </em>concurrence as saying \u201che must present that claim to the circuit court <em>before the jury is discharged.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">Such words should not be taken literally, however, because the case law was not remotely considering the possibility of a difference between the rule that was being announced and the underlying reason for the rule that was being announced. The case law was not contemplating the thought that there might be some \u201cwriggle room\u201d between. In terms of the reason for the rule, the <em>Price </em>concurring opinion also announced that the thing that would \u201cconstitute waiver\u201d was the failure to object when the court still has an opportunity to remedy the error. 405 Md. at 42, 949 A.2d 619. An arcane little scenario that no one ever imagined prompted the question of what happens when the objection comes, to be sure, after the jury has been discharged but at a time when the court and jury can still unquestionably remedy the error?</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\"><em>Teixeira </em>raised the issue. After the jury found Teixeira guilty on all but the weapons counts, the jurors were polled and hearkened. The judge excused them and thanked them for their service, but then sent them back to the jury room, escorted by the clerk, in order to retrieve their personal belongings. It was at that moment that defense counsel raised the issue of inconsistent verdicts and asked the court for permission to argue the issue \u201cbefore the jury leaves.\u201d The judge directed the clerk to \u201chave the jury remain\u201d while that discussion took place. The ultimate issue in <em>Teixeira </em>was whether the defense objection was timely. This Court in <em>Teixeira </em>held that it was.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-7\">Although Teixeira did not question the verdicts until after the jurors were excused from the courtroom, <em>the trial judge </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number><em>directed, the clerk to hold the jury </em>shortly after counsel raised this issue. <em>The venire remained subject to recall </em>and was finally dismissed only after the trial judge heard argument and ruled. On the record before us, <em>we conclude that his question about the propriety of the verdicts was timely.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aju\">213 Md.App. at 674, 75 A.3d 371 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">Sitting in that jury room\u2014in what science fiction writers might call a \u201ctime warp\u201d\u2014and still isolated from the outside world was, to be sure, not a jury but 12 ex jurors still capable of being reconstituted as a jury at a moment\u2019s notice. If a hastily formulated rule inadvertently and informally used such a word as \u201cdismissed\u201d or \u201cdischarged,\u201d such a rule might hypertechnically have been offended. The reason behind the rule, however, was clearly not offended. Judge Thieme\u2019s opinion explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-6\">Thus <em>the operative element in determining when and whether a jury\u2019s functions are at an end is not when the jury is told it is discharged but when the jury is dispersed, </em>that is, has left the jury box, the court room or the court house, had an opportunity to discuss the case with others and <em>is no longer under the guidance, control and jurisdiction of the court. </em>We conclude that Teixeira may challenge the verdicts as inconsistent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">213 Md.App. at 677, 75 A.3d 371 (emphasis supplied). The ultimate concern is not with the dismissal of the jurors but with the dispersal of the jurors.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-8\">Inconsistent Verdicts From A Judge Alone</p>\n<p id=\"b483-9\">Notwithstanding the whirlwind roller coaster ride taken by the law of verdict inconsistency at the hands of a jury\u2014from the common law\u2019s stern prohibition to a century of benign indulgence per <em>Steckler-Dunn-Powell </em>to Maryland\u2019s apparent return to a blanket prohibition in <em>Price </em>to the ameliorating reassurances of the <em>Price </em>concurrence and <em>Tate II </em>and McNeal\u2014the law of verdict inconsistency at the hands of a judge alone (or the judge/jury combination) has, by contrast, never budged.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>If verdicts of conviction and acquittal are inconsistent (legally or factually) at the hands of a judge, the common law generally and Maryland specifically have always held such inconsistency to be reversible error. <em>Johnson v.

The distinction between legal inconsistency and factual inconsistency, now vitally important in assessing jury inconsistencies, thus has no pertinence when examining inconsistent verdicts by a judge alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>The law on inconsistent verdicts of conviction and acquittal returned by a judge is today exactly the same unameliorated law that it has been in Maryland since at least 1965.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">A Cautionary Note</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">The stark distinction between the treatment of inconsistent verdicts in jury trials and in bench trials illustrates something else. In this complicated whirl of inconsistent verdicts, there is little by way of a common denominator. Inconsistent convictions, for instance, are in a class by themselves and should not even enter into the discussion of inconsistencies between convictions and acquittals. Between jury trials and bench trials, moreover, there are more dissimilarities than similarities in handling their respective inconsistencies. Our analysis would be a lot cleaner, therefore, if we could carefully differentiate between the different types of inconsistency and refrain from trying to squeeze dissimilar problems under a single umbrella. Too many cases are cited that are not pertinent, and we spend too much time distinguishing.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">It is the highly particularized problem of arguably inconsistent verdicts by the judge alone that we are dealing with in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-8\">Marginal Evidence of Sexual Contact</p>\n<p id=\"b486-9\">In this case, the evidentiary proof of the vaginal intercourse and the fellatio, on the one hand, and the evidentiary proof of the \u201csexual contact\u201d that was the basis for both the third-degree and the fourth-degree sexual offense charges, on the other hand, were very different. The evidence as to the vaginal intercourse and as to the fellatio was loud and clear. With respect to the sexual contact, it was far more vaporous. Maryland Code, Criminal Law Article, \u00a7 3\u2014301(f)(1) defines \u201csexual contact.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-10\">\u201cSexual contact,\u201d as used in \u00a7\u00a7 3-307, 3-308, and 3-314 of this subtitle, means <em>an intentional touching of the victim\u2019s </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number><em>or actor\u2019s genital, anal, or other intimate area for sexual arousal or gratification, </em>or for the abuse of either party.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">What is involved in sexual contact is purposeful tactile contact and tactile sensation, not incidental touching. It is the sexually-oriented act of groping, caressing, feeling or touching of the genital area or the anus or the breasts of the female victim. It is something other than the necessarily involved contact that is merely incidental to the vaginal intercourse or the sexual act itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">The evidence of what the sexual contact consisted of, as a mere lesser included charge, was extremely vague. The only witness to the sexual contact was the victim herself during her intermittent periods of consciousness. The victim was necessarily conscious, of course, because her testimony, her recollection, was the only evidence we have of any sexual contact. She described her state of semi-consciousness.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-8\">Q. <em>Did you fully wake up during any of this?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-9\">A. <em>No.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-10\">Q. Okay. So\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-11\">A. I remember\u2014I <em>remember\u2014I remember it happening. </em>I\u2014it\u2019s hard <em>to\u2014it\u2019s hard to explain. It almost felt like a dream.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-12\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-13\">The victim\u2019s testimony as to sexual contact <em>per se </em>consisted exclusively of the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-14\">I remember him pulling on my left shoulder to turn me over. And I remember <em>him\u2014I remember him kissing me on the mouth. I remember him putting his hands under my shirt. </em>I remember him\u2014I remember rolling\u2014trying to roll back over. And 7 <em>remember him pulling my pants down </em>while I was on my right side. He was behind me. 7 <em>remember him trying to have anal sex with me. </em>I remem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>ber him pulling on my shoulder a few times hard enough where I had a bruise on my shoulder.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">If this trial had been about the sexual contact alone, the vagueness would have been inconceivable. The charge was largely neglected because it was only peripheral. When the appellant put his hands under the victim\u2019s shirt, did he feel her breasts? When he pulled her pants down, did he fondle her genital area? The court was never told. This was all left very imprecise, as if it were nothing more than background description for the proof of the major charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">The sexual contact in the fourth-degree sexual offense and the sexual contact in the third-degree sexual offense were, on the other hand, necessarily the same and we must look at the divergence in those two verdicts in more detail. With respect to the first two of the three alleged verdict inconsistencies, however, we have little difficulty. An acquittal on the charge of sexual contact and convictions for second-degree rape and a second-degree sexual offense (fellatio) would by no means be factually or logically incompatible. The evidence of sexual contact was a lot closer to being legally insufficient than was the evidence of vaginal intercourse and fellatio.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">Divergent Modalities of Proving Lack of Consent</p>\n<p id=\"b488-9\">As an abstraction and in a larger sense, the appellant is right that all four of the sexually oriented charges in this case (the three convictions and the acquittal) involve the lack of consent on the part of the victim. That generic concept of \u201cabsence of consent,\u201d however, can be established in various ways.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-10\">For the conscious and competent victim, mere passivity, as we have stated, is not enough. Some at least modest verbal or physical resistance must be shown by a victim or some additional or aggravating conduct on the part of the predator must be shown that either overcomes resistance or puts the victim in reasonable fear of resisting. That is why, for second-degree rape, \u00a7 3-304(a)(1) adds the element of \u201cby <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>force, or the threat of force.\u201d In verbatim fashion for a second-degree sexual offense, \u00a7 3\u2014306(a)(1) adds the element of \u201cby force, or the threat of force.\u201d For a third-degree sexual offense, \u00a7 3-307(a)(1) insists that the proscribed sexual contact not only be \u201cwithout the consent of the other\u201d but must be supplemented by at least one of four specific aggravating factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\">The State did not in this case prove the absence of consent by any of those modalities required when dealing with a conscious and competent victim. It turned instead to an alternative modality for establishing the lack of consent. In verbatim terms, \u00a7 3-304(a)(2), \u00a7 3-306(a)(2), and \u00a7 3-307(a)(2) forbid the prohibited sexual behavior</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AmV\">if the victim is a mentally defective individual, a mentally incapacitated individual, <em>or a physically helpless individual, </em>and the person performing the act knows or reasonably should know that the victim is a mentally defective individual, a mentally incapacitated individual, or a physically helpless individual[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">Under the statutory alternative for proving the lack of consent, proof of the very status of the victim, as one unable to give consent or to give legally competent consent, establishes the lack of consent automatically. It was this modality that the State employed for all three of its convictions. The State showed that the victim was asleep when the sexual intercourse began and when the fellatio began. As someone who was asleep, the victim was, in the terms of the statutory provisions, \u201ca physically helpless individual\u201d unable to give consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">When it came to the fourth-degree sexual offense, however, no such statutory alternative was available. As the verdict rendering process was winding down, the lack of that statutory alternative was decisive.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-8\">THE COURT: ... <em>Count No. </em>4 <em>sexual\u2014how is that distinguished from Count No. 3?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-9\">[THE PROSECUTOR]: <em>It doesn\u2019t have the added requirement that she be physically helpless, so it\u2019s any non-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number><em>consensual sexual contact. </em>So\u2014but it would merge into the third degree sex offense for that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-5\">THE COURT: Well, yeah, but I still need to make a finding. Okay. Well, it\u2019s a person may not engage in sexual contact with another without the consent. <em>It doesn\u2019t have the wording as to unaware or unable, so, </em>therefore, <em>I\u2019m, going to find him not guilty of Count No. 4.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">For the three convictions, the trial judge was able to find that the victim was asleep and, for that reason alone, could not give consent. For the acquittal, the statutory alternative of being asleep was not available. \u201cAnd that made all the difference.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The convictions were based on the finding that the victim was asleep. The acquittal made no finding to the contrary. We hold that there was no fatal inconsistency between the convictions and the acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">A Procedural Back-Up</p>\n<p id=\"b490-9\">Simply as a cautionary back-up position, we note that the appellant was either blissfully unaware of any inconsistency in his verdicts as they were announced or was content to enjoy his windfall of an acquittal. <em>McNeal v. State, </em>426 Md. at 466, 44 A.3d 982 not only raised to the authoritative level the <em>Price </em>concurring opinion\u2019s distinction between legal inconsistency and factual inconsistency but also its procedural requirement that any objection on inconsistency grounds shall be made promptly after the verdicts are rendered.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-10\"><em>Only a defendant, </em>not the State, <em>may object to an inconsistent verdict. The objection must be made prior to verdict finality </em>and discharge of the jury ..., thus preventing the defendant from accepting the inconsistent verdict and seeking thereafter a windfall reversal on appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-11\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-12\">As the trial ground to a halt, there was not a glimmer of an objection to inconsistent verdicts.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>THE COURT: ... It doesn\u2019t have the wording as to unaware or unable, so, therefore, <em>I\u2019m going to find, him not guilty of Count No. 4 </em>And then Count No. 5 is assault in the second degree. So <em>I will </em>enter\u2014based on the testimony, enter <em>a finding of guilty as to that count. Is there a need for a presentence investigation in this case ?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-5\">[PROSECUTOR]: I\u2019m not sure, Your Honor. I do have the Defendant\u2019s criminal record with me today. I don\u2019t know if [Defense Counsel] believes that a PSI is necessary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-6\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: 7 <em>would ask the court to proceed to sentencing.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-7\">THE COURT: All right.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">(Emphasis supplied). To ask the court to proceed to sentencing is not to lodge an objection to inconsistent verdicts.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-9\">A Non-Preserved Complaint</p>\n<p id=\"b491-10\">At the end of the trial, the arrival at the verdicts and the rendering of the verdicts was done in a relatively informal and almost collective fashion, as the judge and both lawyers essentially talked their way through the process as a joint enterprise, disposing of one charge before going on to the next. As the court disposed of the rape charge and moved on to the second-degree sexual offense charge, the collective discussion went as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-11\">THE COURT: Travis has violated Section 3-304, <em>rape in the second degree, </em>and, therefore, <em>I\u2019m going to find him guilty of that offense. Likewise\u2014well, 306 is sexual contact, </em>I believe.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-12\">[PROSECUTOR]: It\u2019s <em>the\u2014that\u2019s second degree sex offense, </em>Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-13\">THE COURT: I\u2019m sorry?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-14\">[PROSECUTOR]: <em>It\u2019s sexual act with the victim being physically helpless.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-15\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Okay. But\u2014but\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-16\">THE COURT: Okay. Well, <em>let me see what [the] sexual act is.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>[PROSECUTOR]: That would include\u2014that would be the\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-5\">THE COURT: Well, sexual act is\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-6\">[PROSECUTOR]: <em>Fellatio, that would be the State\u2019s theory.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-7\">THE COURT: <em>Do you want to be heard as to that?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-8\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Yeah. <em>I don\u2019t think there was the act of fellatio </em>as defined\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-9\">THE COURT: <em>I agree.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-10\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: And there was not anilingus. Although, there was some testimony to that effect, but there was no testimony of the elements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-11\">THE COURT: <em>Right. So I'll find him not guilty of Count 2. </em>Count 3\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-12\">[PROSECUTOR]: <em>Your Honor, can I respond briefly to that?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-13\">THE COURT: <em>Sure.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-14\">[PROSECUTOR]: <em>In terms of the second degree sex offense, the fellatio, any contact with the victim\u2019s mouth would be sufficient. So her describing that it touched her teeth, that\u2019s\u2014that would be the State\u2019s theory as to the second degree sex offense.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-15\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: And my response is, <em>there is some validity to the argument, but that would go to sexual contact, which is a third degree sex offense, which only requires a touching.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-16\">[PROSECUTOR]: And\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-17\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: That the act requires more. Because, otherwise, it wouldn\u2019t even be any need to have a third degree sex offense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-18\">[PROSECUTOR]: <em>Your Honor\u2014</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-19\">THE COURT: <em>Go ahead.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-20\">[PROSECUTOR]:\u2014if I may respond. <em>In the notes, fellatio is defined as encompassing oral contact with the </em>male\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-21\">THE COURT: Okay. <em>Wait a minute. Where are you reading?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>[PROSECUTOR]: I\u2019m sorry. The note that says <em>fellatio defined, </em>and it <em>refers to Thomas v. State.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-5\">THE COURT: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-6\">[PROSECUTOR]: <em>It defines it as oral contact with a male sexual organ and penetration of the mouth is not required. So any contact with the victim\u2019s mouth would be sufficient. </em>And with reference to [Defense Counsel]\u2019s comments, the [third] degree sex offense would be referring\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-7\">THE COURT: Well, <em>let\u2019s\u2014I\u2019m going to do one at a time. </em>Are <em>you\u2014do you have it, 158 at the bottom? Fellatio encompasses oral contact\u2014oral contact with the male sex organ and penetration of the mouth is not required. So based on the Thomas case, I\u2014because there is testimony that his perns did make contact with her teeth and she kept her teeth closed so </em>that that was the extent of what occurred, therefore, <em>I will find him guilty of Count No. 2.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"ANZ\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">The appellant now contends that principles of double jeopardy have been offended because he had been pronounced not guilty of the second-degree sexual offense and the judge subsequently subjected him to a second jeopardy. We do not read the finality into that still fluid discussion that the appellant chooses to. Everyone was simply thinking out loud, not yet pronouncing judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-9\">The easy answer, however, is that no objection was made and the point is not preserved for appellate review. From the context itself, it is clear that defense counsel was continuing to engage in the ongoing discussion of precisely what fellatio consists of. Double jeopardy is very much of an appellate afterthought.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-10\">Recognizing his non-preservation problem, the appellant invites us to notice plain error. In seeking to qualify for a relaxation of the preservation requirement, the appellant argues that he is requesting a \u201cplain error\u201d exemption from preservation not pursuant to the regularly invoked provision of Maryland Rule 8-131(a), but under the less familiar authority of Rule 8-131(c), which applies to the review of verdicts in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>non jury trials. As Judge Greene made clear for the Court of Appeals, however, in <em>Bryant v. State, </em>436 Md. 653, 668-69, 84 A.3d 125 (2014):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-5\">[W]e do not agree with Petitioner that Rule 8-131(c) provides an avenue for this Court to exercise its authority to review an otherwise unpreserved or waived issue. <em>Rule 8-131(c) neither expressly nor implicitly provides an exception to our general preservation rules </em>or the contemporaneous objection rule.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">Even if the appellant were able, <em>arguendo, </em>to persuade us that we could, should we wish to do so, notice plain error, he has failed to persuade us why we might wish to. The short answer is that we don\u2019t.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">JUDGMENTS AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b457-9\">. The appellant was also convicted of second-degree assault. We conveniently put to the side the inconsistency contention with respect to the conviction for second-degree assault. We are content to declare <em>ex cathedra </em>that a conviction for second-degree assault and an acquittal for a fourth-degree sexual offense are not fatally inconsistent verdicts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b457-10\">.
