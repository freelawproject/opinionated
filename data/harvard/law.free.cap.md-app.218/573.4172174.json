Parker, Sr., appellants, are the parents of the late Philip E. Parker, Jr., who was an inmate murdered by another inmate on February 2, 2005. Appellants brought suit individually and on behalf of their deceased son\u2019s estate against the State of Maryland (an appellee and cross appellant), and various persons who were State officials whom the appellants alleged bore responsibility for their son\u2019s death. In addition, appellants sued five correctional officers who were transporting inmates via bus when the assault and murder of appellants\u2019 son occurred. A twelve-day jury trial in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City resulted in a verdict in favor of appellants in the aggregate amount of $18.5 million, but the grant of certain post-trial motions resulted in the entry of judgments in a smaller amount. The trial court struck the jury\u2019s finding of gross negligence on the part of one of the individual defendants\u2014Sergeant Larry Cooper, another appellee\u2014and the court entered judgment in favor of all individual defendants pursuant to the doctrine of public official immunity and the immunity for State personnel under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>Maryland Tort Claims Act (\u201cMTCA\u201d). The court entered judgment in favor of appellants against only the State. The court concluded that the State was liable for three separate claims <em>(ie., </em>the survival action and a wrongful death claim for each parent), and the court entered judgment for $200,000 for each of the three appellants. Appellants noted the instant appeal. The State noted a cross-appeal, and contends that appellants are entitled to a single judgment of no more than $200,000.00 in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">QUESTIONS PRESENTED</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">Appellants present four questions for our consideration:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-7\">1. Whether the trial court committed reversible error in striking the jury\u2019s finding of gross negligence as to Sgt. Cooper?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-8\">2. Whether the trial court committed reversible error in applying qualified immunity to protect the individual defendant, Sgt. Cooper?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-9\">3. Whether the State remains liable for the full, uncapped amount of the award?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-10\">4. Whether the MTCA\u2019s cap on damages is unconstitutional, both on its face and as applied in this case?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-11\">The State\u2019s cross-appeal asks:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-12\">1. Does the MTCA limit recovery in this case to no more than $200,000?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-14\">With respect to the claims against Sgt. Cooper, we conclude that, because there was sufficient evidence of gross negligence on the part of Sgt. Cooper to have supported the jury\u2019s finding on that issue, the trial court erred in striking that part of the jury\u2019s verdict. We further conclude that the trial court erred in ruling that there was no special relationship between Sgt. Cooper and the inmates. Consequently, the trial court also erred in concluding that Sgt. Cooper was immune from liability and entering judgment notwithstanding the verdict in favor of Sgt. Cooper. Because Sgt. Cooper\u2019s tortious conduct was gross negligence, he was not entitled to immunity under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>MTCA; and, because Sgt. Cooper owed a duty arising out a special relationship with the inmates in his custody, he was not entitled to common law public official immunity. We will remand the case for further consideration of any other arguments that would permit a remittitur of the verdicts returned against Sgt. Cooper. (Because no party briefed any issue regarding the applicability of the general cap on non-economic damages pursuant to Maryland Code, Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Article (\u201cCJP\u201d), \u00a7 11-108, we express no opinion on that issue.)</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">With respect to the claims against the State, we do not reach appellants\u2019 argument that the State is liable for the full, uncapped verdict; that argument was neither raised in, nor decided by, the trial court. We reject the appellants\u2019 argument that the MTCA\u2019s $200,000 limit on the State\u2019s waiver of sovereign immunity is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">With regard to the State\u2019s cross-appeal, we hold that the trial court erred in entering three judgments against the State in the amount of $200,000 for each of the appellants. We agree with the State\u2019s contention that appellants are entitled to collect no more than $200,000 from the State pursuant to the MTCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b603-8\">On February 1, 2005, several inmates who were incarcerated at the Maryland Correctional Adjustment Center (hereafter referred to as \u201cSupermax\u201d) in Baltimore, were transported by bus to Hagerstown to participate in a hearing at which inmate Kevin Johns was to be sentenced for the murder of a cellmate, committed while Johns was already serving a sentence for another murder. In 2002, Johns had murdered his maternal uncle, nearly decapitating him. For that murder, Johns was sentenced to 35 years\u2019 incarceration, and sent to the Maryland Correctional Training Center (hereafter \u201cHagerstown Correctional Center\u201d) in Hagerstown. While incarcerated in the Hagerstown Correctional Center, Johns stomped his 16-year-old cellmate to death. After he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>convicted of that second murder, he was incarcerated in Baltimore at Supermax pending sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">On February 1, 2005, Johns and three other Supermax inmates were transported to Hagerstown for Johns\u2019s sentencing hearing in the Circuit Court for Washington County. The other three inmates, who testified on Johns\u2019s behalf at the hearing, were: Bradford Diggs, James Folk, and the appellants\u2019 son, Philip E. Parker, Jr.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">Johns was sentenced to life without the possibility of parole for the murder of the cellmate. After the sentencing hearing, the four Supermax inmates were placed on a bus and taken to Hagerstown Correctional Center for a brief period to await transportation back to Baltimore by correctional officers a few hours later. During that bus ride to Baltimore, Johns would murder Philip E. Parker, Jr.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">Two guards from Hagerstown Correctional Center\u2014Bradley Hott and B.J. Vest\u2014later submitted reports in connection with the internal investigation conducted after Parker was murdered. Officers Hott and Vest had transported the Super-max inmates from Hagerstown Correctional Center to the Circuit Court for Washington County for Johns\u2019s sentencing hearing, and back again to Hagerstown Correctional Center once the hearing was over to await the ride to Baltimore. Officer Hott\u2019s report indicated that Johns started laughing when he was sentenced to life without parole, and Johns later commented that \u201cthe killing [had] just begun.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b604-8\">Officer Vest\u2019s report was similar to Hott\u2019s, but provided greater detail as to Johns\u2019s threats to kill again. The report stated: \u201cOfficer Vest advised that Inmate JOHNS made the following comments, \u2018Gonna be trouble when I get back to Baltimore. They think its [sic] bad now, the killing has just begun. I\u2019ll be back in court for these charges for the rest of my life. They will have to put me to death to end this.\u2019 \u201d Neither Officer Hott nor Officer Vest reported these comments immediately to superiors in their chain of command because both officers regarded such comments as \u201cnot uncommon for an inmate in [Johns\u2019s] situation.\u201d Nor was anything <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>in this regard reported to the transportation team from Baltimore when it arrived to transport the Supermax inmates back to Baltimore.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">Shortly before 3 a.m. on the morning of February 2, 2005, the prisoners boarded a \u201cprison bus\u201d owned by the State. Bus # 2809 was a \u201crelatively new\u201d Bluebird bus that had been modified for the transport of prisoners. The front and rear of the bus were equipped with secured compartments in which correctional officers traveled. The officers\u2019 compartment in the rear of the bus was elevated to permit a better view of the interior of the bus. Bus # 2809 was fully loaded on the night in question. It carried 36 inmates and five correctional officers, one of whom acted as the bus driver.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">Bus # 2809 was staffed, as mentioned above, by five correctional officers. Corporal Charles Gaither was the bus driver. Cpl. Kenyatta Surgeon sat in the front of the bus directly behind the driver. Cpl. Earl Generette sat in the front of the bus, across the aisle from Cpl. Surgeon. Cpl. Robert Scott and Sgt. Larry Cooper\u2014the Officer in Charge\u2014sat in the elevated cage in the back of the bus. Seven and one-quarter feet in front of the elevated cage was the last bench seat in the passenger compartment of the bus. The passenger compartment itself was locked, and enclosed by a plexiglass and metal honeycombed grate.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">The five officers had various responsibilities prior to loading the inmates onto the bus. One of Cpl. Surgeon\u2019s responsibilities was to apply three-point restraints\u2014consisting of handcuffs, a lockbox, and a belly chain\u2014to Johns. Cpl. Surgeon did not secure these restraints properly, as the internal investigation later found, with the result that Johns had much more freedom of movement of his arms than he should have had.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">When it was time to board the bus, the Supermax inmates seated themselves on two bench seats in the very rear of the bus, directly in front of the officers\u2019 elevated compartment. This was a violation of a policy of the Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services which provided that Supermax inmates were to ride in one of the two enclosed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>security cages in the front of the bus. Although none of the officers testified that they were even aware of this policy, several officers testified that the two security cages were otherwise occupied on this particular trip.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> One security cage contained an immigration detainee who was required to ride separately from the other State prisoners on the bus. The other cage contained an inmate who had requested to be put in isolation to get away from the four Supermax inmates, with whom he said he had been \u201cbeefing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">The bus departed from Hagerstown Correctional Center shortly before 3 a.m., with Johns and Folk seated on the last bench directly in front of the elevated cage occupied by Cpl. Scott and Sgt. Cooper. In the seat in front of Johns and Folk, at the window, was Philip Parker. Seated next to Parker was Bradford Diggs. During the ride to Baltimore, Diggs got up from his seat and moved across the aisle, leaving the space next to Parker unoccupied. It is a violation of policy for inmates to get up and move around the bus, but none of the guards took corrective action in response to Diggs\u2019s movement.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">At some point during the trip, Johns got up from his seat, reached over the seat in front of him, and strangled Parker. After a time, Johns got up again, moved into the seat next to Parker, and continued strangling him. He also slashed Parker\u2019s neck with a razor blade that had somehow been smuggled onto the bus.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">At a motions hearing in connection with Johns\u2019s trial regarding Parker\u2019s murder, inmate Patrick Cook, who was on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>the bus the night of the murder, testified that he saw Johns murder Parker. Cook provided the following description:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AUEc\">[BY COUNSEL]: How could you see what happened if it was dark?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-5\">[BY COOK]: Because I could see by the, you know, it wasn\u2019t really cloudy out or anything. It was just, you know, if I remember correctly, the skies were fairly clear and it was starry. And at certain overpasses there\u2019s, you know, lights that shine in the bus windows.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-6\">Q Okay. Can you explain to me what you observed the Defendant [Johns] do and where those acts occurred?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AhO\">A As we were coming down Route 70, right as we got past where Route 40 splits off of Route 70 coming in Marriottsville\u2014where Marriottsville Road is, the Defendant and the victim were\u2014they were talking all the way down the road.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-7\">When we got to where Marriottsville Road is, there\u2019s a bridge right between where Route 40 splits off and Marriottsville Road is and there\u2019s a slight bend there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-8\">The Defendant stood up and used his arm to hook the victim and pull his head back over the seat in front of him and kept pressure on him the whole time, and choking him out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-9\">He held him until we got roughly to where Route 29 is, when the victim stopped moving around. Once we crossed over the bridge at the Patapsco River, the Defendant got up out of the seat that was in front of me and moved up into the same [seat] with the victim and grabbed ahold of him again, because the victim started to move.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-10\">And, again, clutched him with his arm and choked him out. By the time we reached the Baltimore Beltway, the victim wasn\u2019t moving anymore, and when we got down to the park and ride, the victim wasn\u2019t moving at all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-11\">I saw that when the Defendant got up out of the seat to move up into the seat with the victim, the man that was sitting in the seat with the victim got up and slid back to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>the seat that\u2019s directly across from me, because there was only one inmate in that seat.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-5\">As the victim [sic] was getting up, the boy that was sitting in the seat with the Defendant handed him razor blades. He spit them out of his mouth and handed them to the Defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-6\">And then, as I said, as the Defendant got up and got in the seat with the victim, he was choking him out, he used the razor blades to cut his neck.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-7\">And the whole time all of this was going on, he was saying, this is what I do best. This makes my dick hard.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-8\">By the time we come around out of the park and ride on to the exit to go on to Cooks Lane, the DOC [Department of Corrections] officers flipped the lights on in the bus to see what was going on.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-9\">At that time the Defendant had the victim pushed down in between the seats where he couldn\u2019t be seen and he\u2014 the boy that was sitting directly in front of me slid to the middle of the seat to block the view of the DOC officers in the back of the bus.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b608-10\">Mr. Cook\u2019s testimony is the most detailed account of what happened to Mr. Parker. All five of the correctional officers on board the bus claimed not to have seen the assault. Even Cpl. Scott and Sgt. Cooper\u2014who were seated only seven feet from where it occurred\u2014denied witnessing the assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-11\">The evidence established that, at the time of the assault, the interior lights of the bus were off, and music was playing. Cpl. Generette was riding in the front of the bus. He testified that he neither saw nor heard anything amiss, and did not realize there might be a problem until he received a call from Cpl. Scott on the internal bus phone. Cpl. Generette testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A4q\">[BY COUNSEL FOR THE STATE]: Did there come a time during the trip back to Baltimore then when something unusual occurred?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-12\">[BY CORPORAL GENERETTE]: Yes, sir. I got a call from Officer Scott.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>Q. And how did you get that call?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-5\">A. We have a\u2014it was an internal phone within the bus. You couldn\u2019t call out on it, just from the back to the front.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-6\">Q. All right. And what did Officer Scott tell you when he called? Did you answer it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-7\">A. Yes, sir, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-8\">Q. What did Officer Scott tell you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-9\">A. He said to me that the guy with the crazy hair [Johns] or just got up and moved around. He said they\u2019re back here playing around, whatever and he said can\u2014he asked me could I see anything and at that point I had Officer Gaither turn the light on the bus and I looked back to the guy he was talking about because I knew he was talking about the crazy guy\u2019s hair, these twisty things in his head. So when I looked back on the bus he was sitting back in his chair with his head laying back like this looking at the ceiling of the bus.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-10\">Q. Now did you use anything besides the interior bus lights to see him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-11\">A. No, sir. When the bus lights were on I could see like the tops of the\u2014it\u2019s kind of hard, but I could see the tops of their heads and I knew where they were sitting at so I know\u2014I knew where two were at.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-12\">Q. And at the time you looked back there you\u2019ve just described what you saw that inmate doing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-13\">A. He had his head back on the chair with his head looking up towards the ceiling just sitting there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-14\">Q. Did you see anything unusual occurring at that time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-15\">A. No, sir, I didn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b609-16\">Cpl. Scott, who was in the back of the bus, described what prompted his call to Cpl. Generette:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-17\">[BY COUNSEL FOR THE STATE]: Okay. Did there come a time when something caught your attention?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-19\">[BY CORPORAL SCOTT]: Yes, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>Q. Can you please tell the jury about that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-4\">A. Well, I saw inmate Johns get up from his seat and move around to the seat in front of him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-5\">Q. What did that mean to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-6\">A. At the time it didn\u2019t mean anything because inmates move all the time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-7\">Q. Are they supposed to?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-8\">A. They\u2019re not supposed to, but we very rarely say anything to them about it because it\u2019s nothing we can do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-9\">Q. Okay. You rarely say anything to them because why?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-10\">A. There\u2019s nothing we can do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-11\">Q. And what do you mean by that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-12\">A. I could tell them to sit down, but I can\u2019t physically go in there and make them sit down.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-13\">Q. Okay. And so what does that put you in a position of?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-14\">A. Huh?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-15\">Q. So what does that mean\u2014how does that affect you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-16\">A. Basically it didn\u2019t affect me until I found it was something going on.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-17\">Q. And when you saw inmate Johns move, can you tell the jury what you saw?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-18\">A. Well, I saw inmate James Folks [sic] slide to the side so he can get past. He moved around to the seat in front of him and he started leaning over like towards the window and he started moving doing something, but I couldn\u2019t see what he was doing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-19\">Q. Okay. So what did you do at that point?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-20\">A. I asked\u2014as soon as he did that I picked up the phone, I called [Generette] to the front, I told him that I seen inmate move from one seat and go to the seat in front of him and I asked him if he could see anything.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-21\">Q. Then what happened?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-22\">A. He was shining his light and myself and Officer\u2014 Sergeant Cooper was shining our lights. Basically it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>was lights going back and forth. I think he told Officer Gaither to cut the lights on, but to me it looked like it wasn\u2019t even any light on. It\u2019s like if somebody had a cigarette lighter. That\u2019s how much light was in the bus.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-5\">Q. What did you do with your flashlight?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-6\">A. I was trying to shine in between the window and the seat to see if I could see him moving.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-7\">Q. And did you see anything at that point?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-8\">A. I was\u2014I saw a blue shirt in between the window and the seat.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-9\">Q. And what seat would that be?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-10\">A. That was one\u2014three seats in front of me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-11\">Q. And did the blue\u2014what did you see, a blue shirt?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-12\">A. What appeared to be a blue shirt because\u2014yes, either a blue shirt or a blue jacket.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-13\">Q. Did that mean anything to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-14\">A. At that time, no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-15\">Q. Why didn\u2019t it mean something to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-16\">A. Because inmates wear blue\u2014blue shirt like pullover shirts and blue jackets. The shirt wasn\u2019t moving, but that\u2019s all I could see when he was laying down was a blue shirt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-17\">Q. So you thought somebody'\u2014you saw\u2014just what did you say again?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-18\">A. I said I couldn\u2019t see what it was. I seen a blue shirt or a jacket, but I couldn\u2019t see what inmate Johns\u2014I mean Johns was doing at the time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b611-19\">Despite the fact that Cpl. Scott testified that he could not see anything definitive, Cpl. Scott was suspicious enough that he told Cpl. Generette that all the officers should \u201cgo into the back of the bus as a team\u201d when the bus arrived at Supermax \u201c[b]ecause I didn\u2019t know if the inmates back there were planning something or if they were already doing something in the back.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b612-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>Cpl. Scott\u2019s seatmate in the back of the bus was also the Officer in Charge during the bus ride, Sgt. Larry Cooper. Pursuant to Departmental policy, the Officer in Charge should have been seated in the front of the bus. During the internal investigation of this incident, Sgt. Cooper admitted that he was unaware of this policy, along with several other Departmental policies. Sgt. Cooper\u2019s testimony at trial was, essentially, that he did not see anything, and could not explain why he did not see anything:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-4\">[BY THE STATE]: Now at that time, early February of 2005, was it the practice to drive to Baltimore with interior lights on or off?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-5\">[BY SGT. COOPER]: No, it was never the practice to drive back with\u2014with the lights on. It was always off[;] unless you had reason to turn them on they stayed off.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-6\">Q. With the lights off were you able to see into the rear compartment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-7\">A. You could not see clearly, but you could just see images of people. You couldn\u2019t see exactly who it was or, you know, pretty much what was going on.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-8\">Q. ... in looking into the rear compartment of the bus, were you able to see silhouettes of persons?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-9\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-10\">Q. Were you able to see person\u2019s movements?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-11\">A. It\u2019s\u2014sometimes. It depends on actually where you were on Route 70 coming back down because it\u2019s\u2014there\u2019s no lights on the highway there and it\u2019s\u2014when it\u2019s pitch black it\u2019s dark.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-12\">Q. Did you have flashlights?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-13\">A. Yes, we did carry flashlights.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b612-14\">On cross-examination, Sgt. Cooper was asked to provide more details about the bus ride, but he was never able to explain why he failed to see the assault and murder of Philip Parker, Jr., which took place just a few feet in front of him. His testimony included the following exchange:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>[BY COUNSEL FOR APPELLANTS]: ...

Possibly.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">Although Sgt. Cooper claimed that he did not see anything particularly troubling in the back of the bus, Cpl. Gaither, the driver, testified that Cpl. Generette relayed to him that Cpl. Scott \u201csaid something was going on\u201d in the back of the bus. With the bus lights out, Cpl. Gaither \u201cpicked up the pace a little bit\u201d and proceeded to Supermax.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-8\">When the bus arrived at Supermax, the inmates were called off the bus one at a time, with the four Supermax inmates called first. Diggs and Folk were called and exited the bus. Next, Johns was called. His shirt was observed to be bloody, and he had a cut on his arm. Cpl. Surgeon took Johns inside Supermax. Philip Parker\u2019s name was then called. After he failed to reply, he was found unconscious on the bus, wedged between his seat and the bus window. Cpl. Scott and Cpl. Gaither had to remove his restraints to pull him out from under the seat. The officers carried Parker to the front of the bus, where Cpl. Gaither administered three rounds of CPR until EMTs arrived. At that point, Cpl. Gaither and Cpl. Scott carried Parker off the bus, and the EMTs took over. Photographs introduced at trial demonstrated that there was blood smeared on top of the seat back and in the seat portion of the bench seat in which Philip Parker was sitting when he was murdered.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-9\">Battalion Chief (then Lieutenant) Theresa Harp of the Baltimore City Fire Department EMS service testified that she was summoned to Supermax at approximately 4:00 a.m. on the morning of February 2, 2005. She found Philip Parker \u201cunresponsive and in cardiac arrest\u201d when she arrived, and he was being worked on by other EMS personnel. Eventually, Philip Parker was transported to Mercy Hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 4:57 a.m., without ever having re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>gained consciousness. The official cause of death was determined to have been strangulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-4\">An internal investigation was launched, which resulted in the terminations from State service of Cpl. Surgeon and Cpl. Scott. Both terminations were upheld on appeal. Sgt. Cooper also was going to be terminated for his role in these events, but he opted instead to retire. Cpl. Gaither and Cpl. Generette were also disciplined; each was given an official reprimand, with Cpl. Generette also receiving a five-day suspension without pay. The disciplinary documents, including Notices of Termination, generated by the internal investigation were admitted, over the State\u2019s objection, at the trial of this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">After providing timely notice pursuant to the Maryland Tort Claims Act, appellants filed a complaint and jury demand on May 15, 2006, naming as defendants: the State of Maryland; Mary Ann Saar, then-Secretary of the Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services; Frank C. Sizer, Jr., then-Commissioner of Corrections; Lehrman Dotson, then-Warden of Supermax; and the five individual correctional officers identified above who staffed the bus. The suit was brought by appellants Melissa Rodriguez, individually and as personal representative of Philip Parker, Jr.\u2019s estate, and Philip Parker, Sr. The original complaint included six counts. Count 1 asserted a claim pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 for violation of Philip Parker, Jr.\u2019s rights under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. Count 2 alleged that the defendants violated Philip Parker, Jr.\u2019s rights under Articles 24 and 26 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. Count 3 alleged wrongful death. Count 4 was a survival action. Count 5 alleged assault and battery against the individual officers in connection with their actions after the bus arrived back at Supermax. And Count 6 sought funeral expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">On June 29, 2006, the State removed the case to federal court. On February 8, 2008, the State filed a motion to dismiss or, in the alternative, for summary judgment. On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>April 30, 2008, appellants filed their response, along with their own motion for summary judgment. A motions hearing was held on July 25, 2008, and on July 31, 2008, the United States District Court for the District of Maryland granted the State\u2019s motion for summary judgment and dismissed, with prejudice, the federal claims. The order further provided that the federal court would decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the state law claims, and the court remanded those claims to the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. Because the parties to this appeal disagree on the import of the federal court\u2019s memorandum opinion which was filed with the order, we will discuss it in more detail later in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">Following remand to the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, the case was stayed while appellants pursued an appeal, ultimately unsuccessfully, to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. In early 2011, the Circuit Court for Baltimore City issued a scheduling order providing that trial would begin on October 11, 2011. As scheduled, trial proceedings took place on October 11-14, 17-21, and 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">On October 24, the jury returned its verdict, responding as follows to the questions submitted. The jury found that Cpl. Scott, Cpl. Surgeon, Cpl. Gaither, and Sgt. Cooper had been negligent, and that the negligence of each was a proximate cause of Mr. Parker\u2019s death. The jury found Cpl. Generette not to have been negligent at all. The jury found that, of the five officers, Sgt. Cooper alone had also been grossly negligent. The jury also answered in the affirmative the question of whether it found that \u201cany employee of the State of Maryland in addition to the above named individual correctional officers was negligent toward Philip E. Parker, Jr.,\u201d and whether that negligence was a proximate cause of Mr. Parker\u2019s death. In addition to awarding appellants $15,000.00 in funeral expenses, the jury awarded non-economic damages to Mr. Parker\u2019s estate in the amount of $10,000,000.00, non-economic damages to the father in the amount of $1,000,000.00, and non-economic damages to the mother in the amount of $7,500,000.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>Timely post-trial motions were filed by the defendants. By reference to docket entries, we glean that, on November 1, 2011, the defendants filed two motions for remittitur, a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict as to the jury\u2019s finding that Sgt. Cooper had been grossly negligent, and a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict as to all individual defendants, asserting the immunity of the individual defendants under both common law public official immunity and the Maryland Tort Claims Act.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Appellants filed oppositions to the motions, the defendants filed responses to the oppositions, and finally, on April 9, 2012, a hearing was conducted.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">On June 8, 2012, the two orders that have prompted this appeal and cross-appeal were docketed. Those orders: 1) struck the jury\u2019s finding of gross negligence as to Sgt. Cooper, 2) recognized the immunity from liability of all individual defendants, including Sgt. Cooper, \u201cunder both Public Official Immunity and the Maryland Tort Claims Act, Maryland Code, State Government Article \u00a7 12-104(a),\u201d 3) entered judgments notwithstanding the verdict in favor of each of the individual defendants, including Sgt. Cooper, 4) ruled that there were three claims under the Maryland Tort Claims Act, and granted remittiturs of the jury\u2019s awards of compensatory damages to $200,000 for each of the three appellants, and 5) entered judgment in the amount of $200,000 in favor of each of the three appellants ($600,000 in the aggregate) against only the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">Timely appeals were noted to this Court by both sides. Appellants argue that the trial court erred in striking the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>jury\u2019s finding of gross negligence as to Sgt. Cooper, finding that immunity protected Sgt. Cooper from liability, and in remitting the jury\u2019s award in any amount. Appellants also argue that the limit on damages in the Maryland Tort Claims Act is unconstitutional, both on its face and as applied in this case. In the State\u2019s cross-appeal, it contends that the court erred in remitting the award to $600,000.00; the State asserts that the total amount collectible under the MTCA is limited to $200,000.00 for all appellants collectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">I. Gross Negligence</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">The term \u201cgross negligence\u201d has been described as an amorphous concept, resistant to precise definition. In <em>Barbre v. Pope, </em>402 Md. 157, 187, 935 A.2d 699 (2007), the Court of Appeals recognized that \u201c[tissues involving gross negligence are often more troublesome than those involving malice because a fine line exists between allegations of negligence and gross negligence.\u201d \u201cGross negligence has been equated with \u2018wilful and wanton misconduct,\u2019 a \u2018wanton or reckless disregard for human life or for the rights of others.\u2019 \u201d <em>Foor v. Juvenile Services Admin., </em>78 Md.App. 151, 170, 552 A.2d 947 (quoting <em>White v. King, </em>244 Md. 348, 223 A.2d 763 (1966)). It has also been described as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-8\">an intentional failure to perform a manifest duty in reckless disregard of the consequences as affecting the life or property of another, and also implies a thoughtless disregard of the consequences without the exertion of any effort to avoid them. Stated conversely, a -wrongdoer is guilty of gross negligence or acts wantonly and willfully only when he inflicts injury intentionally or is so utterly indifferent to the rights of others that he acts as if such rights did not exist.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AJS\"><em>Liscombe v. Potomac Edison Co., </em>303 Md. 619, 635, 495 A.2d 838 (1985) (quoting <em>Romanesk v. Rose, </em>248 Md. 420, 423, 237 A.2d 12 (1968)).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-9\">\u201cWhether or not gross negligence exists necessarily depends on the facts and circumstances in each case. It is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>usually a question for the jury and is a question of law only when reasonable men could not differ as to the rational conclusion to be reached.\u201d <em>Romanesk, supra, </em>248 Md. at 423, 237 A.2d 12 (citation omitted). Courts have said that the question of whether a defendant\u2019s conduct rises to the level of gross negligence is a question for the trier of fact to decide: \u201cOrdinarily, unless the facts are so clear as to permit a conclusion as a matter of law, it is for the trier of fact to determine whether a defendant\u2019s negligent conduct amounts to gross negligence.\u201d <em>Taylor v. Harford County Dept. Of Social Services, </em>384 Md. 213, 229, 862 A.2d 1026 (2004) (quotation marks and citations omitted). <em>See also Artis v. Cyphers, </em>100 Md.App. 633, 652, 642 A.2d 298 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">In the present case, the trial court gave two reasons for granting the judgment notwithstanding the verdict as to the jury\u2019s finding of gross negligence on the part of Sgt. Cooper: (1) because \u201cthe allegations of gross negligence [in the complaint] are practically non-existent,\u201d and (2) because \u201c[n]o evidence presented adequately supports the assertion that Sgt. Cooper\u2019s actions .. . rose to the level of \u2018outrageous\u2019 or \u2018utterly indifferent to the rights of others.\u2019 \u201d We hold that these rulings were erroneous for the reasons set forth below. But the defendants also argue that, even if the trial court erred in granting judgment notwithstanding the verdict as to the finding of gross negligence on the part of Sgt. Cooper, the finding of gross negligence should nevertheless be vacated because it was the product of certain improperly admitted evidence. Finally, the defendants argue that the federal court\u2019s rejection of appellants\u2019 federal claims required a ruling by the trial court against the appellants on the gross negligence issue. We reject these last two arguments for the reasons set forth below.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">A. Pleading requirements</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">On Friday, October 21, 2011, after a two week trial and while arguing its motion for judgment at the close of evidence, the defendants asserted, among other things, that there was not sufficient evidence of gross negligence, but they did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>assert that there was a defect in the pleadings. On Monday, October 24, 2011, just before jury instructions were given, the defendants for the first time asserted that the complaint did not sufficiently allege gross negligence on the part of the correctional officers. The court denied both the October 21 motion for judgment and the October 24 request to reconsider. But seven months after the trial, the court reversed course in its memorandum opinion and order of June 8, 2012, granting the State\u2019s motion for JNOV on the gross negligence issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the adequacy of the complaint remained open to challenge after the close of evidence at trial, <em>see </em>Maryland Rule 2-324(a), we are satisfied that the allegations in the complaint were sufficient to state a claim for damages based upon gross negligence. In <em>Tavakoli-Nouri v. State, </em>139 Md.App. 716, 730-31, 779 A.2d 992 (2001), in reviewing the trial court\u2019s dismissal of a <em>pro se </em>complaint for failure to state a claim, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-6\">[I]t is not essential for the plaintiff to identify the particular \u201clegal name\u201d typically given to the claim he has pled. The critical inquiry is not whether the complaint specifically identifies a recognized theory of recovery, but whether it alleges specific facts that, if true, would justify recovery under any established theory. Essentially, a complaint is sufficient to state a cause of action even if it relates \u201cjust the facts\u201d necessary to establish its elements. This is consistent with the \u201cnotice\u201d purpose of the modern complaint; \u201c[a] pleading shall contain only such statements of fact as may be necessary to show the pleader\u2019s entitlement to relief....\u201d Md. Rule 2\u2014303(b); <em>see Scott v. Jenkins, </em>345 Md. 21, 28, 690 A.2d 1000 (1997).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">Here, the record is plain that, even before the complaint was filed, the State was aware that gross negligence would be at issue in this case. The notice of claim sent to the State Treasurer in April 2005 put the State on notice that appellants would be asserting a claim for \u201cacts and omissions that amount to gross negligence[.]\u201d Moreover, a review of the complaint reveals that facts which would constitute gross <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>negligence were sufficiently pled by appellants; the complaint included the following allegations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-5\">30. At some time during the transport of inmates from Hagerstown to Baltimore, the deceased was strangled, assaulted, battered and had his throat slashed. This, despite a prolonged struggle, yelling for help, suspicious movements and actions by a number of inmates, and other conduct which should have led to prompt measures being taken to stop the brutal attack and to save the deceased\u2019s life. The failure of the correctional staff to provide timely and proper assistance to the deceased in his helpless condition amounted to <em>deliberate indifference on the part of all defendants.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-6\">31. Upon information and belief, one or more of the staff assigned to the transport vehicle were sleeping, listening to a radio or watching a portable televison, inattentive and/or unwilling to become involved in stopping the brutal attack upon the defenseless deceased leading to his death.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-7\">34. Upon information and belief, the officers on the transport vehicle knew, or reasonably should have known, of impending violence in general, and particularly in regard to inmate Johns who had threatened to kill. Despite this knowledge and/or the ability to obtain the knowledge, nothing was done to provide care, safekeeping and protection to the deceased. The failure to properly supervise and control Johns while transporting him in a bus full of restrained inmates constituted both <em>cruel and unusual punishment and deliberate indifference to the helpless state of the decedent </em>and others riding on the said transport vehicle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-8\">35. Upon information and belief, when the said transport vehicle arrived at Supermax and Philip E. Parker was observed by correctional staff and while still living, was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>removed from the same vehicle by yanking him off of the seat where he was slumped over bleeding, pulled by his legs down the aisle of the bus, and dragged off the bus with his head striking each step and onto the concrete where the bus had stopped.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-5\">36. Upon information and belief, once being taken off the said vehicle, the deceased was allowed to lay in place for a period of time before being taken to Supermax at which time his body was allowed to lay on the ground in a holding area for a significant and unreasonable amount of time before any one of a number of officers standing around, began to administer CPR in an attempt to resuscitate and revive the still living Philip E. Parker, Jr., all of these acts, errors and omissions constituted <em>cruel and unusual punishment and deliberate indifference to the helpless state of the decedent </em>and others riding on the said transport vehicle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-6\">37. That for a substantial period of time prior to the events of February 1 and February 2, 2005 the defendants, the State, Saar, and Sizer, their agents[,] servants and employees acting within the scope of their employment had received numerous and repeated complaints from wardens, supervisory and managerial employees, and subordinates, other administrative personnel, correctional officers, inmates, families of inmates, and other interested person that there was inadequate staff, and resources, improper assignment of staff, improper hiring, training, supervision, improper equipment, including vehicles, and inadequate policies, directives, procedures, as well as the failure to follow written and verbal policies, directives and procedures, all of which created hazardous and unconstitutional conditions, especially with respect to the manner and methods used to transport Supermax inmates, such as Johns. In addition, said defendants had actual and constructive notice and knew, or reasonably should have known, that many of the policies, procedures and directives, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>including those that are written and disseminated to State correctional employees, from top to bottom, were regularly, habitually and continuously not followed, not expected to be followed, and could not have been followed, given the shortage of personnel and the allocation of staff and resources and the lack of adequate staff and resources and equipment needed to ensure even the most basic safety requirements in a constitutionally sufficient fashion and the administration as a whole, and thereby the State of Maryland, <em>has shown a deliberate indifference to the safety of employees, inmates generally and particularly the deceased, </em>especially in the area of transportation of inmates, and in particular regarding the facts and circumstances, acts, errors and omissions, <em>which exceed mere negligence or gross negligence, </em>and which led to and proximately caused and/or contributed to the death of the decedent. All of this <em>constituted deliberate indifference to the safety of all inmates </em>assigned for care, safekeeping and protection, by the defendant state and such indifference also has placed correctional staff involved in the day to day operation of the State\u2019s prison facilities and more particularly, involved in the transport of inmates from one facility to another at great risk for their safety.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-5\">42.

This was enough to assert a claim of gross negligence. Accordingly, it was error for the trial court to have decided, post-trial, that gross negligence was not sufficiently pled.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-8\">B. The trial court erred in substituting its view of evidence for the jury\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-9\">As noted above, the question of whether or not gross negligence exists is one for the jury. Here, the jury made a specific finding that defendant Cooper \u201cwas grossly negligent toward Philip Parker, Jr.\u201d In <em>Barnes v.

Cooper was grossly negligent. There was evidence that Sgt. Cooper was required, during transport, to maintain \u201cdirect observation\u201d of inmates, which is defined as \u201ccontinuous, unobstructed surveillance.\u201d He was seated just a little more than seven feet from where the violent attack on Philip Parker occurred, yet performed his surveillance duties with such indifference and disregard for Parker\u2019s safety that Sgt. Cooper failed to take any action to stop the attack and prevent the murder occurring right in front of him. The attack occurred in phases. Initially, Johns <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>stood and hooked his arm around Philip Parker\u2019s neck from behind, choking him. Later, when Philip Parker began to make guttural sounds, Johns changed seats in order to continue the attack. Others in the bus saw and heard the attack. Moreover, the State performed a reenactment of the attack in the course of its investigation, and concluded that Johns\u2019s movements inside the bus should have been readily observable by a person in Sgt. Cooper\u2019s position even with the lights completely off and only a small amount of ambient light from outside.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">Yet Sgt. Cooper claimed to have seen nothing unusual on the night in question, not even Johns\u2019s change of seats. Sgt. Cooper claimed to have heard nothing unusual. The movement by inmates inside the bus was contrary to policy, and Cpl. Scott even reported Johns\u2019s movement to Sgt. Cooper. Cpl. Scott called the front of the bus and asked that the lights be turned on. There was evidence that Cpl. Scott and Sgt. Cooper shined their flashlights in the vicinity of where Johns was sitting, but did not leave their seats to investigate further. Despite the claims of seeing no unusual activity, there was evidence that the officers on the bus were sufficiently concerned that something \u201cunusual\u201d had or was happening that the driver of the bus increased his speed, and the officers formulated a plan to enter the bus as a team upon arrival at Supermax. This was contrary to the usual deboarding procedure, and was an acknowledgment that the \u201cunusual\u201d events that had taken place on the bus indicated potential danger to personal safety. But Sgt. Cooper, as the Officer in Charge, failed to conduct or order any effective investigation of the unusual activity among the inmates on the bus. Sgt. Cooper\u2019s own testimony that he did not see what was there to be seen right in front of him\u2014Johns standing and later changing seats in order to strangle and cut Parker, and Parker\u2019s futile (and, according to the testimony of Patrick Cook and Johns\u2019s own statement, noisy) struggles\u2014could support a rational inference that Sgt. Cooper was \u201cso utterly indifferent to the rights of others the inmates in his custody] that he act[ed] as if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>such rights did not exist.\u201d <em>Romanesk, supra, </em>248 Md. at 423, 237 A.2d 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-4\">In <em>Catterton v. Coale, </em>84 Md.App. 337, 579 A.2d 781 (1990), we held that a motion to dismiss a negligence and malicious prosecution suit against a county social worker should not have been granted because, we observed, the plaintiffs allegation in that case that the social worker had fabricated a report \u201cis sufficient to show malice or gross negligence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 343-44, 579 A.2d 781.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">In <em>Newell v. Runnels, </em>407 Md. 578, 967 A.2d 729 (2009), the Court of Appeals reversed the grant of summary judgment in favor of the State\u2019s Attorney for Caroline County, who had been sued after firing two employees who had campaigned for the opposing candidate in the election in which the State\u2019s Attorney won his job. The issue for the court was whether the plaintiffs had generated \u201ca triable issue as to whether [the State\u2019s Attorney] acted with ... gross negligence when he fired them, such that he, in his individual capacity, could be held liable under the MTCA.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 606, 967 A.2d 729. The Court held that summary judgment should not have been granted because the fired employees had \u201cgenerated a material dispute of fact concerning the issue of possible gross negligence on [the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s] part.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 638, 967 A.2d 729. Finding that \u201ca reasonable trier of fact reasonably could infer that [the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s] decision to terminate Plaintiffs reflected a conscious disregard for their rights as employees,\u201d and further finding that Plaintiffs \u201carticulated facts tending to show that Newell\u2019s decision to fire them was, at worst, a targeted reprisal for speaking against him or, at best, a reckless disregard for their rights to free speech,\u201d the Court concluded that summary judgment had been improper. <em>Id. </em>at 639, 967 A.2d 729.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">Similarly, there was adequate evidence for the jury to find gross negligence in the acts and omissions of Sgt. Cooper in the present case. Gross negligence was properly pled and was supported by the evidence. The jury\u2019s finding on that factual issue should not have been disturbed by the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>C. The trial court\u2019s evidentiary rulings were not erroneous and do not require a new trial on the gross negligence of Sgt. Cooper.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">The defendants argue that, even if the trial court erred in granting judgment notwithstanding the verdict as to the finding of gross negligence on the part of Sgt. Cooper, the finding of gross negligence should be vacated because it was the product of certain improperly admitted evidence. Specifically, the defendants argue that the trial court committed reversible in admitting into evidence redacted versions of (1) \u201cAdministrative Charging Documents,\u201d and (2) an \u201cout of court statement of Kevin Johns.\u201d We find no error in the admission of this evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">The defendants fail to identify by exhibit number the \u201cAdministrative Charging documents\u201d to which they object. In context, however, the defendants appear to be referring to the \u201cNotices of Termination\u201d issued to several correctional officers by the State and signed by Secretary Saar. The only objections made at trial when these Notices of Termination were offered were that the documents constituted inadmissible hearsay and were unduly prejudicial. We hold that the Notices of Termination that were signed by Secretary Saar were properly admitted against the State pursuant to Maryland Rule 5-803(a) as statements of a party opponent.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">Rule 5-803(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-8\">The following are not excluded by the hearsay rule, even though the declarant is available as a witness:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-9\">(a) Statement by party-opponent. A statement that is offered against a party and is:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-10\">(1) The party\u2019s own statement, in either an individual or representative capacity;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-11\">(2) A statement of which the party has manifested an adoption or belief in its truth;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-12\">(3) A statement by a person authorized by the party to make a statement concerning the subject; [or]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>(4) A statement by the party\u2019s agent or employee made during the agency or employment relationship concerning a matter within the scope of the agency or employment ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b631-5\"><em>See, e.g., Crane v. Dunn, </em>382 Md. 83, 96, 854 A.2d 1180 (2004) (\u201c \u2018Admissions, in the form of words or acts of a party-opponent, may be offered as evidence against that party.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Briggeman v. Albert, </em>322 Md. 133, 586 A.2d 15 (1991)); <em>B &amp; K Rentals &amp; Sales Co. v. Universal Leaf Tobacco Co., </em>324 Md. 147, 157-58, 596 A.2d 640 (1991) (\u201cStatements by agents concerning a matter within the scope of the agent\u2019s employment and made during the existence of the agency relationship should be admissible without the necessity of proving that the agent had authority to speak or that the statements were part of the <em>res </em>gestae.\u201d (Citing Federal Rule of Evidence 801(d)(2)(D))).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">The \u201cNotices of Termination\u201d reflected the results of the State\u2019s investigation and were the State\u2019s official position on the conduct of its employees during the incident. These Notices of Termination stated on their face that they were issued \u201c[u]nder the authority of Title 11 of the State Personnel and Pensions Article,\u201d and were signed and \u201capproved by\u201d Secretary Saar. The State was and is a party to the action, as was Secretary Saar. These documents contained \u201cstatements of a party opponent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">The State, however, contends that the documents did not contain \u201cadmissions\u201d of the State and Secretary Saar because the documents included charges of recklessness, intentional misconduct, and gross negligence on the part of correctional officers, and because neither the State, nor Secretary Saar, could ever be liable for such conduct under the MTCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-8\">The short answer to this contention is that Rule 5-803(a) provides for the introduction in evidence of \u201cstatements\u201d of a party opponent and the party\u2019s agents, and is not limited to statements which constitute an admission by the party. Professor Lynn McLain explains in her treatise on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>Maryland evidence that the statement of a party opponent need not be an admission against interest:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-5\">The term \u201cadmission\u201d is misleading, in that it suggests that an out-of-court statement must have been against the party-opponent\u2019s interest at the time it was made in order for it to qualify under the hearsay exception. This suggestion is compounded by frequent confusing references to this hearsay exception as involving \u201cadmissions against interest.\u201d To the contrary, in order for a statement to qualify under the party-opponent hearsay exception, there is no requirement that the out-of-court statement have been against the party\u2019s interest at the time it was made; it may even have been self-serving then.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">Lynn McLain, 6A Maryland Evidence \u00a7 801(4):1 at 332 (3d ed.2013) (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">Moreover, the documents <em>did </em>contain numerous admissions which supported the claim against the State. The Notices of Termination contained admissions as to a number of duties owed by the State and its employees to the decedent. For example, the Notice of Termination issued to Sgt. Cooper admitted that, \u201c[p]rior to seating the inmates on the bus, the CTU officers were responsible for securing the inmates in a three-piece restraint device that consists of handcuffs, leg irons and a waist restraint chain, secured by a metal box and a padlock.\u201d In the Notice of Termination, the State admitted that the Officer in Charge, Sgt. Cooper, \u201cwas responsible for supervising the transportation detail.\u201d The Notice of Termination admitted that the correctional officers, including Sgt. Cooper, had a duty to be \u201cfamiliar with the directives pertaining to the transportation bus\u201d and a duty to be \u201calert and attentive at all times during their tour of duty.\u201d The Notices of Termination contained admissions by the State that the officers, including Sgt. Cooper, breached duties owed to the decedent. For example, the Notice of Termination issued to Sgt. Cooper stated that, \u201cas the Officer-in-Charge, Mr. Cooper had a duty to take the appropriate steps necessary to prevent inmate Johns\u2019 murder of inmate Parker. The investigation revealed that he failed to issue any orders to subor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>dinate staff or to the inmate in custody.\u201d The Notice of Termination issued to Sgt. Cooper also stated: \u201cAfter reviewing the investigative findings, it was determined that Mr. Cooper violated several Post Orders, Institutional Directives and Department of Public Safety &amp; Correctional Services\u2019 policies and procedures.\u201d The admission of these documents was not error.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">The defendants also include a single sentence in a footnote in their brief critical of the admission in evidence of Exhibits 43 and 44. The footnote states: \u201cSimilarly, the memoranda on which Secretary Saar based her decision to approve the termination, admitted as Plaintiffs\u2019 Ex. 43 and 44, were, as defense counsel observed, riddled with prejudicial and inadmissible hearsay.\u201d The defendants, however, did not provide any further argument regarding Exhibits 43 and 44, and did not include the referenced exhibits in their Appendix. It appears that Exhibit 43 was a memorandum prepared by the Department proposing termination of Cpl. Scott, and Exhibit 44 was a similar memorandum proposing termination of Sgt. Cooper. In the absence of any argument from the defendants as to why these documents should be treated differently from the Notices of Termination discussed above, we decline to address this argument further. <em>Shell Oil Co. v. Ryckman, </em>43 Md.App. 1, 4, 403 A.2d 379 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">Finally, the defendants assert that the trial court erred in admitting into evidence the transcribed statement that Johns gave to a State investigator three days after the murder. The defendants\u2019 objection to the statement at trial was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Al1\">So our general objection to the confession would be that Mr. Johns wasn\u2019t competent to testify or help himself or anything like that on February 1st. So we\u2019re not sure\u2014we have no idea what his state of mind was [on the date of the statement], but we don\u2019t think he would have been a competent witness. So we think that\u2019s one basis for excluding a confession.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-9\">And then I guess just to post generally of course we have no ability to cross-examine Mr. Johns when he was talking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>to the IIU investigator with regard to this. And we just found out recently that this transcript was available....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-5\">So if this court were actually\u2014is going to hold that the confession is admissible, there are parts that we think are, excerpts not admissible, like where he gives statements where he doesn\u2019t\u2014where he makes conjecture and he says things that are not based in fact. So I would\u2014like he says, he says, for example, Officer Scott had to have seen what happened. Well, he doesn\u2019t know whether Officer Scott should\u2014you know, could have seen or not. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s admissible at all and I would ask that be stricken.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-6\">We haven\u2019t had time to go through it line by line, but if this court were to say it were admissible despite our objection, there\u2019s some parts unfortunately we would really like to keep out of the jury\u2019s view.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">Although the defendants now claim that the transcribed statement was inadmissible hearsay, the word \u201chearsay\u201d does not appear anywhere in the defendants\u2019 objection at trial. Generally, Maryland litigants are not required to state the specific ground for an objection unless requested to do so by the trial court. Maryland Rule 2-517. But, if counsel argues specific grounds for an objection, the litigant may raise on appeal only those grounds actually presented to the trial court. All other grounds for the objection, including those appearing for the first time in a party\u2019s appellate brief, are waived. <em>See, e.g., United States Gypsum Co. v. Baltimore, </em>336 Md. 145, 173-75, 647 A.2d 405 (1994). Because no hearsay objection was argued at trial, none will be entertained on this appeal.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b635-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>D. The federal court\u2019s rejection of the federal claims did not require a ruling against appellants on the gross negligence issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">The defendants argue that, \u201cin light of the federal district court\u2019s ruling that Sgt. Cooper\u2019s conduct was merely negligent, the circuit court\u2019s ruling [granting judgment notwithstanding the verdict as to Sgt. Cooper\u2019s gross negligence] was required [in order] to prevent legally\u2014and factually\u2014 inconsistent final judgments in the same case.\u201d This argument assumes that the federal court considered and rejected a claim of gross negligence under Maryland State law. That was not the case. Appellants\u2019 federal claim was brought under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 for an alleged violation of the decedent\u2019s rights under the 8th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. The opinion of the federal court dealt with the legal question of whether the officers were \u201cdeliberately indifferent\u201d to the decedent\u2019s rights to a degree that would support the federal claim. The Fourth Circuit held that this standard requires a plaintiff to show that the officer \u201cknows of and disregards an excessive risk to inmate health and safety\u201d and this standard \u201csets a particularly high bar to recovery.\u201d While the \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d standard under federal law may have similarities to the \u201cgross negligence\u201d standard under state law, they are not fungible. Indeed, the federal court specifically abstained from deciding any State law issue and remanded all of those issues, including the issue of gross negligence, to the State courts. The ruling of the federal court on the federal claim was not dispositive of State claims based upon gross negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">II. Immunities</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">Our holding that the trial court erred in striking the jury\u2019s finding of gross negligence on the part of Sgt. Cooper requires us to examine the implications of that finding with respect to the liability of the various defendants and the application of any immunities. The defendants argue that the trial court correctly found that Sgt. Cooper was shielded from liability by common law public official immunity and by immunity under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>the MTCA. Appellants respond that public official immunity, regardless of its source, is destroyed in the presence of gross negligence and/or a special relationship, both of which exist here. We will address and examine each potential source of immunity. Because we conclude that Sgt. Cooper is not entitled to protection of immunity under either the MTCA or common law public official immunity, we will then address the impact of that loss of immunity on the judgments in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">A. Immunity under the MTCA</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">Because the jury\u2019s finding that Sgt. Cooper acted with gross negligence must be reinstated, Sgt. Cooper is not eligible for immunity under the MTCA, and the State retains its sovereign immunity with respect to the claims against Sgt. Cooper. The MTCA is codified at Maryland Code (1984, 2009 Repl.Vol.), State Government Article (\u201cSG\u201d), \u00a7 12-101 <em>et seq. </em>Section 12-104 provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-7\">(a) (1) Subject to the exclusions and limitations in this subtitle and notwithstanding any other provision of law, the immunity of the State and of its units is waived as to a tort action, in a court of the State, to the extent provided under paragraph (2) of this subsection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-8\">(2) The liability of the State and its units may not exceed $200,000 to a single claimant for injuries arising from a single incident or occurrence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-9\">(b) Immunity is not waived under this section as described under \u00a7 5-522(a) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b636-10\">Section 5-522 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article\u2014referenced in SG \u00a7 12-104(b)\u2014provides, in pertinent part that, when State personnel commit a tortious act or omission with gross negligence, then (a) the sovereign immunity of the State is not waived, and (b) there is no statutory immunity under the MTCA for the State personnel who committed the act or omission. Section 5-522 provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b636-11\">(a) Immunity of the State is not waived under \u00a7 12-104 of the State Government Article for:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>(1) Punitive damages;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-5\">(2) Interest before judgment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-6\">(3) A claim that arises from the combatant activities of the State Militia during a state of emergency;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-7\">(4) Any tortious act or omission of State personnel that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-8\">(i) Is not within the scope of the public duties of the State personnel; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-9\">(ii) Is made with malice or gross negligence;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-10\">(5) A claim by an individual arising from a single incident or occurrence that exceeds $200,000; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-11\">(6) A cause of action that law specifically prohibits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-12\">(b) State personnel, as defined in \u00a7 12-101 of the State Government Article, are immune from suit in courts of the State and from liability in tort for a tortious act or omission that is within the scope of the public duties of the State personnel and is made without malice or gross negligence, and for which the State or its units have waived immunity under Title 12, Subtitle 1 of the State Government Article, even if the damages exceed the limits of that waiver....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b637-13\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b637-14\">When we read SG \u00a7 12-104 and CJP \u00a7 5-522 together, it is clear that State personnel are immunized for their tortious conduct committed within the scope of their public duties, unless that conduct was, as in the case of Sgt. Cooper, committed \u201cwith malice or gross negligenee[.]\u201d CJP \u00a7 5-522(a)(4)(ii). The jury\u2019s finding that Sgt. Cooper acted with gross negligence defeats his claim to immunity for State personnel under the MTCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-15\">B. Common law public official immunity</p>\n<p id=\"b637-16\">Common law public official immunity applies when (1) the actor is a public official, and (2) the complained-of conduct occurred in the course of the actor\u2019s performance of discretionary\u2014as opposed to ministerial\u2014acts, which were (3) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>within the scope of the actor\u2019s official duties. <em>Houghton v.

Prince George\u2019s County, </em>288 Md. 315, 323 n. 9, 418 A.2d 1173 (1980), \u201cdid not purport to overrule <em>Carder\u2019s </em>specific holding that a prison guard was a public official in the context of public official immunity\u201d). Ministerial duties are those to which nothing is left to the official\u2019s discretion, while discretionary acts are those involving \u201cthe freedom and authority to make decisions and choices.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Clark v. Ferling, </em>220 Md. 109, 113, 151 A.2d 137 (1959). No dispute has been raised in this case as to whether Sgt. Cooper\u2019s actions were discretionary or ministerial. Like the police officer who was deemed a public official in <em>Houghton, supra, </em>412 Md. at 585, 989 A.2d 223, Sgt. Cooper also was empowered with the discretionary \u201c \u2018freedom to act according to one\u2019s judgment in the absence of a hard and fast rule.\u2019 \u201d (Quoting <em>Schneider v. Hawkins, </em>179 Md. 21, 25, 16 A.2d 861 (1940)). Sgt. Cooper fell within the class of employees who might enjoy <em>common </em>law public official immunity based on being a public official, engaged in the performance of discretionary acts, within the scope of his employment. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">Common law public official immunity does not protect a defendant against personal liability in cases where the official committed an intentional tort, <em>Houghton, supra </em>at 586, 989 A.2d 223, or acted with malice, <em>Robinson v. Board of County Comm\u2019rs for Prince George\u2019s County, </em>262 Md. 342, 348, 278 A.2d 71 (1971) (\u201cIndeed we can not think of any reason why a public official should not be held responsible for his malicious actions even though he claims they were done within the scope of his discretionary authority.\u201d). But, in this case, there was no finding of actual malice; nor was there a finding of liability in connection with any intentional tort. These two disqualifications for common law public official immunity therefore do not apply to the case at hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>In the briefs in this case, the parties disagree about the impact the jury\u2019s finding of gross negligence has upon the applicability of common law public official immunity. The appellants insist that either gross negligence or (as we shall discuss later) a special relationship defeats common law public official immunity. The defendants argue that only malice provides an exception to common law public official immunity. In support of the defendants\u2019 position, they cite <em>McCoy v. Hatmaker, </em>135 Md.App. 693, 763 A.2d 1233 (2000); <em>Lee v. Cline, </em>384 Md. 245, 863 A.2d 297 (2004); <em>Livesay v. Baltimore County, </em>384 Md. 1, 862 A.2d 33 (2004); and <em>D\u2019Aoust v. Diamond, </em>424 Md. 549, 36 A.3d 941 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-4\">In <em>McCoy, </em>the widow of a man who died suddenly in his car sued Hatmaker, a Baltimore City paramedic, and Schwaab, a Baltimore City police officer, alleging that neither man\u2014both trained first responders\u2014complied with the relevant standard of care when each assessed the decedent as beyond resuscitative help. The widow asserted that Hatmaker and Schwaab acted with gross negligence. Hatmaker and Schwaab raised the Good Samaritan Act and the Fire and Rescue Company Act as defenses, and argued that, because they did not act with gross negligence, they were immune from suit under both statutes. The trial court agreed, and granted summary judgment in their favor. On appeal, we affirmed because the appellant could not point to any facts showing \u201ca deliberate choice not to give McCoy a chance to survive.\u201d In affirming, we also noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-5\">Even if appellant could have proven gross negligence, Officer Schwaab, as a law enforcement official, also qualifies for public official immunity under the rule of <em>DiPino v. Davis, </em>354 Md. 18, 48-49, 729 A.2d 354 (1999). Such immunity is hard to defeat. Under the rule of <em>DiPino, </em>the court must find that two factors exist simultaneously before it can relieve a governmental official of liability for his negligent acts. First, the actor whose conduct is at issue must be a public official rather than a mere government employee or agent. Second, the tortious conduct must have occurred while he was performing discretionary rather <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>than ministerial acts in furtherance of his official duties. If the official can establish those two factors, he receives qualified immunity, that is, immunity <em>in the absence of malice.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">135 Md.App. at 719, 763 A.2d 1233 (emphasis added). Accordingly, there is <em>dicta </em>(but not a holding) in <em>McCoy </em>indicating that public official immunity would have been applicable \u201c[e]ven if the appellant could have proven gross negligence.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">In <em>Lee v. Cline, </em>384 Md. 245, 863 A.2d 297 (2004), a case interpreting the MTCA, the Court of Appeals discussed common law public official immunity only tangentially. The passing reference to gross negligence in <em>Lee </em>appears in the context of a discussion of immunity under the MTCA. <em>Id. </em>at 261, 863 A.2d 297 (\u201c[T]he purpose of the [Maryland] Tort Claims Act\u2019s immunity is to insulate state employees generally from tort liability if their actions are within the scope of employment and without malice or gross negligence.\u201d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\"><em>Livesay v. Baltimore County, </em>384 Md. 1, 862 A.2d 33 (2004), was a Local Government Tort Claims Act (LGTCA) case in which a Baltimore County correctional officer\u2014Officer Fore\u2014 was sued for his failure to render direct assistance to an inmate who had attempted suicide. The correctional officer described himself as being \u201cin shock\u201d upon finding the inmate \u201csitting slumped on the floor of his cell, a bed sheet tied between his neck and the bunk bed.\u201d Officer Fore called the jail\u2019s Emergency Response Team, but made no other effort to provide care to the inmate while waiting for the team to arrive. By the time the team arrived, the inmate suffered hypoxic brain damage. The inmate subsequently filed a negligence action against Officer Fore, the correctional officer who initially discovered the attempted suicide. The circuit court granted summary judgment to Officer Fore on the basis of common law and statutory public official immunity. Among Livesay\u2019s contentions on appeal was his argument that a county employee is not a \u201cmunicipal\u201d employee, a notion the Court of Appeals rejected. In affirming the circuit court\u2019s finding that Officer Fore was entitled to statutory public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>official immunity \u201cso long as he is acting in a discretionary capacity, without malice, and within the scope of his employment or authority,\u201d the Court also noted that LGTCA expressly preserved, in CJP \u00a7 5-503(d), \u201cany common law or statutory defense or immunity in existence as of June 30, 1987.\u201d The Court further discussed public official immunity at common law as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-5\">We have held that the purpose of [CJP] \u00a7 5\u2014507(b)(1) \u201cwas to codify existing public official immunity, and not to extend the scope of qualified immunity beyond its Maryland common law boundaries.\u201d <em>Lovelace v. Anderson, </em>366 Md. 690, 704, 785 A.2d 726, 734 (2001) (quoting <em>Ashton v. Brown, </em>339 Md. 70, 116 n. 23, 660 A.2d 447, 470 n. 23 (1995)). As discussed <em>infra, </em>officials of Maryland counties enjoy common law public official immunity. Section 5-507(b)(1) codified the common law, and while it did not extend the scope of the common law, it did not limit it either. Under the common law, county public officials enjoyed immunity; accordingly, despite the seemingly narrower drafting, \u00a7 5-507(b)(1) applies to county as well as municipal officials. As appellees point out, a contrary holding would produce the absurd result that when city and county police respond to the same emergency, the former enjoy immunity but the latter do not. We do not believe the Legislature intended this result.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-6\">Because we hold that \u00a7 5-507(b)(1) merely codified Maryland common law public official immunity, and because the case law on common law public official immunity is more developed, we shall analyze Fore\u2019s situation in that context. A governmental representative is entitled to public official immunity under the common law when he or she is acting as a public official, when the tortious conduct occurred while that person was performing discretionary rather than ministerial acts, and when the representative acted without malice. See <em>Lovelace v. Anderson, </em>366 Md. 690, 714, 785 A.2d 726, 739 (2001) (citing James <em>v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>288 Md. 315, 323, 418 A.2d 1173, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>1178 (1980)); <em>Williams v. Mayor &amp; City Council of Baltimore, </em>359 Md. 101, 137, 753 A.2d 41, 61 (2000).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b642-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 12, 862 A.2d 33 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">On its face, the statement in <em>Livesay </em>indicating that a government representative is entitled to common law public official immunity if the representative acted \u201cwithout malice\u201d seems to imply that only malice can defeat such immunity. But the <em>Livesay </em>Court expressly avoided reaching such a conclusion, stating, <em>id. </em>at 18, 862 A.2d 33:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-7\">Livesay, for the first time [on appeal], contends that Fore established a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d with him, and that under our holdings in <em>Williams </em>[359 Md. 101, 753 A.2d 41 (2000),] and <em>Ashburn </em>[306 Md. 617, 510 A.2d 1078 (1988) ], this defeats Fore\u2019s claim of immunity. Livesay also contends for the first time that Fore acted with \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d when he failed to render direct aid.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-8\">Because these issues were not raised below, we shall not consider them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b642-9\"><em>D'Aoust v. Diamond, </em>424 Md. 549, 36 A.3d 941 (2012), dealt with a foreclosure sale in which the property owner claimed that the court-appointed trustees failed to send proper notice to her at her last known address, and then lied about having accomplished service in an affidavit filed with the court. For that reason, the property owner argued, the trustees were not \u201cpublic officials\u201d entitled to public official immunity. Both the trial court and this Court ruled that the trustees were protected by qualified judicial immunity. But the Court of Appeals sided with the property owner, and held that the trustees enjoyed neither qualified judicial immunity nor common law public official immunity. The Court of Appeals noted that it had never recognized a \u201cqualified judicial immunity.\u201d 424 Md. at 585, 36 A.3d 941. Moreover, the Court held that, because the trustees \u201cwere clearly not public officials,\u201d it was plain that \u201cthe concept of qualified public official immunity is inapplicable to their actions in connection with the judicial sale of [the property owner\u2019s] condominium.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 592, 36 A.3d 941. Consequently, <em>D\u2019Aoust </em>offers no guidance on the question of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>whether public official immunity protects Sgt. Cooper from personal liability in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">In the cases above, the Court described common law public official immunity as being available to a governmental representative when he or she is acting as a public official if the tortious conduct occurs while performing discretionary rather than ministerial acts and the representative acts without malice. But none of these cases specifically holds that a finding of malice is the only way to defeat common law public official immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">Appellants cite two cases which they argue constitute \u201ccontrary and more recent authority\u201d in support of their contention that gross negligence defeats common law public official immunity: <em>Hines v. French, </em>157 Md.App. 536, 852 A.2d 1047 (2004), and <em>Lovelace v. Anderson, </em>366 Md. 690, 785 A.2d 726 (2001). But our examination of these cases does not persuade us that either case provides compelling support for appellants\u2019 argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\"><em>Hines </em>involved an appeal from a grant of summary judgment in favor of a deputy sheriff who allegedly attacked the plaintiff during a traffic stop and, without provocation, forced her face into the side of her vehicle despite having noticed that she had recent TMJ surgery. In reversing the summary judgment in favor of the deputy sheriff, we held: \u201cAssuming a jury found these allegations to be true, [the deputy\u2019s] conduct would constitute <em>malice, </em>and thus, qualified immunity would not be available to him as a defense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 564, 852 A.2d 1047 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-8\">In <em>Hines, </em>we explained that, when a claim is made under the MTCA, State personnel are immune, pursuant to CJP \u00a7 5-522(b), from liability in tort for an \u201c <em>\u2018act or omission, that is within the scope of the public duties of the State personnel and is made without malice or gross negligence </em>....\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 562, 852 A.2d 1047 (quoting CJP \u00a7 5-522(b)) (italics in quoted opinion). We then stated: \u201cAccordingly, whether under common law qualified immunity or the statutory qualified immunity provided by the MTCA, [the defendants] may only avoid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>liability for a claim of negligence if their conduct was within the scope of the duties of State personnel and each acted without malice or gross negligence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 562, 852 A.2d 1047. To the extent that the quoted language from <em>Hines </em>suggested that gross negligence might also defeat common law public official immunity (as it does MTCA statutory immunity), such statement was clearly <em>dicta </em>because there was no claim of gross negligence in that case. <em>Hines </em>did not hold that the gross negligence of a defendant defeats public official immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\"><em>Lovelace </em>involved an appeal from a grant of summary judgment on grounds of public official immunity in favor of a hotel security guard and his employer. The privately-employed security guard\u2014who was an off-duty police officer\u2014 shot and injured a hotel guest while engaged in a gun battle with two armed robbers in the hotel lobby. <em>Lovelace </em>held that the security guard would not be entitled to public official immunity if a finder of fact concluded that he was acting as a private security guard for the hotel rather than as a public official. Consequently, the circuit court should not have granted summary judgment on the basis of immunity. Although the <em>Lovelace </em>Court cited other cases for the proposition that common law public official immunity may not apply under circumstances where there is a special relationship between a police officer and a victim, <em>id. </em>at 706-07, 785 A.2d 726, the Court did not hold that proof of gross negligence would defeat common law public official immunity if the official could otherwise qualify for such immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">We conclude that existing case law does not definitively answer the question of whether gross negligence defeats common law public official immunity. Appellants nonetheless insist that this Court should recognize such a rule (a) because, \u201cwhen the legislature codified public official immunity [in the MTCA], it specifically included gross negligence as an exception,\u201d and (b) because \u201cthe interplay between the MTCA and Article 19 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights mandates adoption of the gross negligence standard for piercing public official immunity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b645-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>We find it unnecessary to resolve the dispute between the parties as to whether common law public official immunity can be defeated by proof of gross negligence; there is an alternative ground for invalidating Sgt. Cooper\u2019s claim of common law public official immunity. The Court of Appeals has stated: \u201cIn the presence of a \u2018special relationship,\u2019 liability may lie, and [public official] immunity may not survive.\u201d <em>Williams v. Mayor &amp; Council, </em>359 Md. 101, 144, 753 A.2d 41 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-4\">Here, there was clearly a special relationship between Sgt. Cooper and the decedent, Philip Parker, Jr., and also a special relationship between Sgt. Cooper and the murderer, Kevin Johns. To the extent the trial court found otherwise, such ruling was clear error. Indeed, the defendants, on appeal, do not contest the existence of a special relationship between Sgt. Cooper and the inmates under his charge. Rather, they disagree about the impact such a relationship has upon the availability of common law public official immunity under Maryland law. Defendants argue that, whether a special relationship exists is a factor which has bearing on only the issue of whether a public official owes a duty to the plaintiff, and is not a factor which has any impact in determining whether the official is entitled to immunity if such a duty is breached. However, this position is at odds with <em>Williams, </em>in which the Court of Appeals held that a public official\u2019s breach of a duty arising out of a special relationship not only gives rise to liability but also defeats a claim of common law public official immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\"><em>Williams </em>involved a negligence suit against a police officer arising out of a domestic violence incident. There was no claim that the officer either acted with malice or committed gross negligence, but, viewed in a light most favorable to the plaintiffs, the facts supported a finding of a special relationship between the defendant police officer and the plaintiffs. The police officer responded to the home of a domestic violence victim who had been beaten by her abuser. While the victim was giving a statement to the police officer, her abuser called her. After hanging up the phone, the victim told her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>mother, in the police officer\u2019s presence, that her abuser had threatened to return to the home. A short while later, the abuser phoned the home again, and this time the victim\u2019s mother answered. The mother expressed her anger at the abuser, and hung up the phone. The police officer took statements from the victim and her mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">According to the mother, the officer told her \u201cthat he had to write his report, and that she was to go in the house, because he was going to remain outside.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 150, 758 A.2d 41. Unfortunately, the police officer grew impatient waiting for someone to bring him a camera to photograph the daughter\u2019s injuries, and, without telling the mother or daughter he was leaving, the police officer decided to drive to the police station to get a camera. Before he returned with a camera, the abuser returned. The abuser shot and killed the daughter, and also shot the mother, who survived but was partially paralyzed. <em>Id. </em>at 107, 753 A.2d 41.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">Suit was subsequently filed against the police officer, alleging that a special relationship had arisen between him and the two women as a result of his actions and express promise of protection. The plaintiffs alleged that this special relationship imposed a duty on the police officer beyond that which would ordinarily be owed generally to citizens threatened by crime. The circuit court granted summary judgment in favor of the police officer based on the court\u2019s finding that, as a matter of law, the police officer \u201cwas acting in a discretionary capacity, without malice, at the time of the incident and was therefore entitled to qualified immunity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 112, 753 A.2d 41. Although this Court affirmed the grant of summary judgment in favor of the police officer, the Court of Appeals reversed, relying on the \u201cthe special relationship exception\u201d to qualified immunity. <em>Id. </em>at 130-31, 753 A.2d 41. The Court held that the police officer\u2019s \u201caffirmative actions, directions and specific promises of protection ... if they occurred and were reasonably relied upon by [the plaintiffs], may have created a special relationship between [the officer] and [the plaintiffs] that would establish a duty of care on the part of [the officer] to protect them; therefore his actions at [the home of the</p>\n<p id=\"b647-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>plaintiffs] might not be protected by either statutory or common law immunity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 112-13, 753 A.2d 41. The <em>Williams </em>Court reiterated this holding in its \u201cConclusion\u201d section of the opinion, <em>id. </em>at 151, 753 A.2d 41, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-5\">LW]e hold that [the police officer\u2019s] affirmative actions and specific promises of protection to [the mother and daughter], if in fact they occurred, are sufficient to have created a special relationship between himself and [the mother and daughter]. This special relationship, if it existed, may have created a duty of protection on the part of [the police officer]. If so, his actions at [the victims\u2019 residence] may not warrant protection under either statutory or common law immunity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">Although <em>Williams </em>appears to be the only case in which the Court of Appeals has expressly held that common law public official immunity may be defeated by proof of a special relationship, similar language appears in <em>Lovelace v. Anderson, </em>366 Md. 690, 785 A.2d 726 (2001). In <em>Lovelace, </em>the Court of Appeals stated: \u201cAnother limitation to a police officer\u2019s defense of public official immunity occurs when, under the circumstances, a special relationship exists between the officer and the injured person which creates a duty on the part of the officer to protect the victim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 706, 785 A.2d 726 (citing <em>Williams, supra, </em>359 Md. at 143-45, 753 A.2d 41). The appellees fail to discuss\u2014or even <em>cite\u2014Williams </em>and <em>Lovelace </em>in their briefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">There was clearly a special relationship between Sgt. Cooper and the decedent\u2014and between Sgt. Cooper and Kevin Johns\u2014that imposed a duty on Sgt. Cooper to protect the decedent from Johns. In <em>Ashburn v. Anne Arundel County, </em>306 Md. 617, 630 n. 2, 510 A.2d 1078 (1986), the Court of Appeals explained that a special relationship exists where there is an ongoing custodial relationship:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-8\">We also note that under \u00a7 315(a) of the Restatement (Second) of Torts a duty would be imposed upon an officer to prevent physical harm caused by another to a third person where a special relationship exists between the police officer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>and the actor. Such special relationships have been found as to: parent and child, master and servant, landowner and licensee, those in charge of persons with known dangerous propensities, and those who have custody of others. See <em>Lamb v. Hopkins, </em>303 Md. 236, 492 A.2d 1297 (1985); Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7\u00a7 316 to 320. In order for such a relationship to be found between police and perpetrator, it must be alleged that there was some type of ongoing custodial relationship between the police officer and the actor. <em>Lamb v. Hopkins, supra; </em>see <em>Jackson v. Clements, </em>146 Cal.App.3d 983, 194 Cal.Rptr. 553, 555 (1983). Such was not the case sub judice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">In <em>Lamb v. Hopkins, </em>303 Md. 236, 492 A.2d 1297 (1985), the Court of Appeals \u201cexpressly adopt[ed] \u00a7 319 [of the Restatement (Second) of Torts] as the law of this State governing the duty of those in charge of persons having dangerous propensities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 245, 492 A.2d 1297. <em>Accord Remsburg v. Montgomery, </em>376 Md. 568, 591, 831 A.2d 18 (2003). Section 319, captioned \u201cDuty of Those in Charge of Person Having Dangerous Propensities,\u201d provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-7\">One who takes charge of a third person whom he knows or should know to be likely to cause bodily harm to others if not controlled is under a duty to exercise reasonable care to control the third person to prevent him from doing such harm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b648-8\">The Comments to \u00a7 319 are illuminating. Comment a states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Abb\">a. The rule stated in this Section applies to two situations. The first situation is one in which the actor has charge of one or more of a class of persons to whom the tendency to act injuriously is normal. The second situation is one in which the actor has charge of a third person who does not belong to such a class but who has a peculiar tendency so to act of which the actor from personal experience or otherwise knows or should know.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b648-9\">Johns, a Supermax inmate, and a two-time murderer, was within \u201cthe class of persons to whom the tendency to act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>injuriously is normal.\u201d And there can be no doubt that the correctional officers transporting Johns back to Supermax had knowledge of Johns\u2019s potentially injurious tendencies. Sgt. Cooper, in particular, was an experienced corrections officer who was the Officer in Charge of the transportation detail. Managing the behavior of individuals like Johns is a component of a corrections officer\u2019s job.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">Similarly, the special relationship that imposes a duty upon correctional officers to protect persons in their custody from harm is recognized in \u00a7 320 of the Restatement (Second) of Torts, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-6\">One who is required by law to take or who voluntarily takes the custody of another under circumstances such as to deprive the other of his normal power of self-protection or to subject him to association with persons likely to harm him, is under a duty to exercise reasonable care so to control the conduct of third persons as to prevent them from intentionally harming the other or so conducting themselves as to create an unreasonable risk of harm to him, if the actor</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-7\">(a) knows or has reason to know that he has the ability to control the conduct of the third persons, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-8\">(b) knows or should know of the necessity and opportunity for exercising such control.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b649-9\">Comment c to \u00a7 320 indicates that the duty is applicable when a jailer has custody of a prisoner who is unable to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>protect himself from \u201cnotoriously dangerous\u201d persons, \u201cas where a prisoner is put in a cell with a man of known violent temper.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">In its resolution of the post-trial motions at issue here, the trial court concluded that no special relationship existed, citing <em>Clark v. Ferling, supra, </em>220 Md. 109, 151 A.2d 187, as \u201cprecedential\u201d and factually \u201canalogous\u201d to the instant ease. In <em>Clark, </em>the parents of a juvenile inmate of the Maryland Reformatory sued Ferling (who was the superintendent of that institution) after their son was beaten to death in prison by other inmates. In the suit, the parents alleged that their son had testified against certain inmates; that the inmates bore the Clarks\u2019 son \u201cgreat hatred and animosity\u201d and \u201cwere determined to seek revenge against him at the first opportunity\u201d; and that Ferling had permitted their son to be housed in the same dormitory with the inmates, which led, the parents alleged, to his fatal beating. Their case was dismissed by the circuit court on demurrer, and the plaintiffs appealed. The Court of Appeals affirmed the dismissal, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-6\">[T]he declaration here has no allegation of malice or evil design on the part of defendant, and further it contains no flat or direct statement that he knew there were \u201cvicious, brutal and homicidal inmates\u201d confined in the dormitory to which the deceased was assigned, that the deceased had testified against anyone causing his conviction, or that anyone had hatred or animosity toward the deceased. Therefore, all that we need to hold in order to decide this case, and all that we do hold, is that the defendant\u2019s duties in safely confining the deceased were public in character ...; and that he is not liable for injuries inflicted by one of his prisoners upon another, at least, in the absence of an allegation of malice or evil purpose on his part, that he knew of some unusual danger to the party injured, or that he participated in inflicting the injury. <em>Cf. St. Julian v. State, </em>La.App., 1957, 98 So.2d 284.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b650-8\">Accordingly, the holding in <em>Clark </em>is easily distinguished from the present case by the lack of knowledge on the part of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>the superintendent in that case and his absence from the scene of the inmates\u2019 assault. <em>Clark </em>does not support the trial court\u2019s erroneous conclusion that there was no special relationship between Sgt. Cooper and the inmates involved in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">Because a special relationship existed between the inmates and Sgt. Cooper, and because that relationship gave rise to a duty which was clearly breached, the trial court erred in finding that Sgt. Cooper was entitled to the benefit of common law public official immunity. <em>Williams, supra, </em>359 Md. at 112-13, 151, 753 A.2d 41.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">III. Should the State be held liable for the full uncapped amount of the verdict?</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">Appellants argue that our conclusion that Sgt. Cooper was not entitled to immunity under either the MTCA or common law public official immunity compels restoration of the jury\u2019s full award of damages against Sgt. Cooper. We agree, subject however, to any rights of remittitur that may remain unaddressed by the trial court.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b651-8\">Without citation to authority, the appellants also argue \u201cthat the State is required to indemnify Larry Cooper in order to avoid a conflict of interest in the Office of the Attorney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>General because the same member of that office represented both the officer and the State at Trial.\u201d The appellants\u2019 argument is that the \u201cinterests of the State and the individual Defendants are irreconcilable as to the issue of malice/gross negligence and in connection with the post trial motions\u201d and that this divergence in interests gives rise to an \u201cunwaivable conflict of interest under Maryland Rule 1.7.\u201d The only remedy to address this conflict of interest, the appellants assert, is to require the State to fully indemnify Sgt. Cooper.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">The State responds: (1) \u201cthere was no conflict of interest because counsel for the State admitted that there was negligence and that the State was therefore liable up to the $200,000 which the State has already paid\u201d; (2) \u201cif there were a conflict of interest, that would be for Sgt. Cooper to raise, not the plaintiffs\u201d; (3) \u201cif the plaintiffs could raise the issue, it would not be in an appeal from the verdict below, but in a separate proceeding to enforce the judgment\u201d; and (4) \u201cthe law is clear that the State\u2019s agreement to represent a State officer or employee never includes an obligation to indemnify.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">These arguments are not ripe for appellate review because it does not appear to us that they were raised in the circuit court. There is no ruling of the circuit court addressing these issues, and we decline to consider such potential issues further. Maryland Rule 8-131(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">IV. Constitutionality of the MTCA\u2019s \u201ccap\u201d on damages</p>\n<p id=\"b652-8\">The appellants ask us to consider the constitutionality of the MTCA\u2019s \u201ccap\u201d on damages, arguing that it violates Article 19 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, the constitutional mandate of separation of powers, the constitutional right to trial by jury, and the constitutional right to equal protection of the law. The State responds that the MTCA\u2019s restriction on recovery is actually a limit of the State\u2019s waiver of sovereign immunity, not a legislative \u201ccap\u201d on damages. In <em>Proctor v. Washington Metro. Transit Authority, </em>412 Md. 691, 723, 990 A.2d 1048 (2010), the Court of Appeals explained that, although the MTCA\u2019s limit functions like a cap, \u201cit is more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>accurately described as a limit on the State\u2019s waiver of sovereign immunity.\u201d The Court stated unequivocally: \u201c[T]he limit on damages contained in \u00a7 12-104(a) of the State Government Article is a term of the State\u2019s waiver of sovereign immunity, not a cap on damages.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 722-23, 990 A.2d 1048. We agree with the State that only the General Assembly can expand that waiver. <em>Jekofsky v. State Rds. Comm\u2019n, </em>264 Md. 471, 474, 287 A.2d 40 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">Moreover, in <em>Gooslin v. State, </em>132 Md.App. 290, 752 A.2d 642 (2000), <em>cert. denied, </em>359 Md. 334, 753 A.2d 1031 (2000), this Court previously considered and rejected two of the four arguments advanced by the appellants, namely, that the MTCA\u2019s limited waiver of sovereign immunity violates Article 19 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, 132 Md.App. at 296, 752 A.2d 642, and violates the constitutional right to equal protection, <em>id. </em>at 298, 752 A.2d 642. We decline to reconsider our decision in <em>Gooslin.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">We also reject appellants\u2019 remaining two arguments, namely (1) that the MTCA\u2019s limited waiver of sovereign immunity violates the constitutional mandate of separation of powers, and (2) violates the constitutional right to trial by jury. Appellants argue that the MTCA\u2019s limited waiver of immunity violates the separation of powers doctrine because it interferes with the right of judiciary to curb excessive jury verdicts and to render and enforce judgments. This argument is unavailing. The limited waiver of sovereign immunity did not limit the ability of Maryland judges to enter and enforce damage awards against the State. To the contrary, the limited legislative waiver of sovereign immunity established the ability of judges to enter damage awards where no ability previously existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">The argument that the limited waiver violates the constitutional right to trial by jury is similarly unavailing. Prior to the enactment of the limited legislative waiver of sovereign immunity, there was no right to recover tort damages against the State\u2014by jury trial or otherwise. The partial waiver of sovereign immunity created a limited right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>jury trial where none had previously existed. Accordingly, we hold that the MTCA, which permits a right to jury trial where no such right previously existed, does not violate appellants\u2019 constitutional right to jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">V. The MTCA limits recovery against the State to no more than $200,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">We turn now to the issue raised by the State on its cross appeal. The State argues that the MTCA limits recovery against it to $200,000 and that the trial court erred in entering multiple judgments in the aggregate amount of $600,000. For the reasons to follow, we agree with the State on this point and hold that the appellants\u2019 judgments against the State are limited to $200,000 in the aggregate.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">The MTCA provides, in pertinent part, that \u201c[t]he liability of the State and its units may not exceed $200,000 to a single claimant for injuries arising from a single incident or occurrence.\u201d SG \u00a7 12-104(a)(2). The State relies on COMAR 25.02.02.02, an implementing regulation promulgated by the State Treasurer governing the administration of the MTCA. The State asserts that the following provisions of COMAR 25.02.02.02D are dispositive:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-8\">D. Limits of Liability. Within total budgeted funds available for self-insurance coverage of tort claims, the limits of State liability shall be:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-9\">(1) Subject to \u00a7 D(2) of this regulation, $200,000 per claimant for all injury, loss, and damage to person and property arising from a single incident. For the purpose of determining the limits of liability under this subsection, all persons claiming damages resulting from:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-10\">(a) Bodily injury to, or the death of, any one person shall be considered to be one claimant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b654-11\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b654-12\">Appellants argue that the language of the implementing regulation varies from the plain language of the statute, which specifies only a $200,000 limitation per claimant, without at<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>tempting to define or delimit \u201cclaimant.\u201d Appellants contend that the State\u2019s regulation is at odds with the plain language of the statute, is entirely self-serving, and deserves no deference. Accepting these arguments, the trial court found that the implementing regulation was \u201ccontradictory to the legislative intent\u201d; that legislative history did not support such a restrictive interpretation of \u00a7 12-104 as the State was attempting to ascribe to it with its regulation; and that the regulation relied on by the State \u201cdirectly contravenes both the plain language of the MTCA and the demonstrated legislative intent.\u201d Consequently, the trial court concluded that there were three separate claimants\u2014Mr. Parker, Sr.; Ms. Rodriguez; and the Estate of Mr. Parker, Jr.\u2014and that each was entitled to collect $200,000 from the State under the MTCA, for a total recovery of $600,000. We conclude that the trial court erred in this regard.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">No reported case from either appellate court of this State has ever squarely considered the question presented here, namely the weight to be given the implementing regulation at issue, COMAR 25.02.02.02(D).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> For the following reasons, we hold that the regulation is entitled to substantial weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>A. Statutory Interpretation</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">The Court of Appeals, in <em>Forster v. Public Defender, </em>426 Md. 565, 45 A.3d 180 (2012), observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-6\">The goal of statutory interpretation is to \u201cascertain and implement, to the extent possible, the legislative intent.\u201d An appellate court interprets a statute by first looking to its plain language, giving the words their natural and ordinary meaning. To determine the plain meaning of language, we consider also the statutory scheme in which the particular provision or provisions appear. If the language is clear and unambiguous on its face, our inquiry ends.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b656-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 579-80, 45 A.3d 180 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-8\">Although the trial court\u2019s interpretation of SG \u00a7 12-104(a)(2) is at issue in this appeal, there are other statutes and regulations relevant to our analysis. CJP \u00a7 3\u2014904(f) establishes that there can be but one action for wrongful death. That provision was at issue in <em>State v. Copes, </em>175 Md.App. 351, 927 A.2d 426 (2007), where an action for wrongful death was initially brought by only one of a decedent\u2019s three adult daughters. This Court found that the proper notice given pursuant to the MTCA by one daughter sufficed to put the State on notice of the claims of the other daughters. <em>Id. </em>at 444-45. <em>Copes </em>also bears on the instant case because it discusses the effect of certain implementing regulations for the MTCA, including the notice provisions of COMAR 25.02.03.02.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-9\">In <em>Copes, </em>we noted that SG \u00a7 12-106, which requires a \u201cclaimant\u201d to provide notice to the State Treasurer of a claim within one year after the injury giving rise to the claim, does not otherwise define the term \u201cclaimant.\u201d Because SG \u00a7 12-106 was \u201cnot clear on that point,\u201d we concluded that an ambiguity existed, which required us to resort to other \u201ctools of statutory construction at our disposal,\u201d including COMAR. <em>Copes, </em>175 Md.App. at 381, 927 A.2d 426 (citing <em>Reier v. State Dep\u2019t Of Assessments and Taxation, </em>397 Md. 2, 26, 915 A.2d 970 (2007)). In <em>Copes, </em>we discussed the same section of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>COMAR at issue in the case at bar, the \u201cState Insurance Programs\u201d subtitle.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-4\">Our discussion in <em>Copes </em>noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-5\">Administrative regulations have the force of law when they are \u201clegislative\u201d and not merely \u201cinterpretive.\u201d A regulation is \u201clegislative\u201d when it \u201caffects individual rights and obligations\u201d and \u201cthe agency intended the rule to be legislative as \u2018evidenced by such circumstantial evidence as the formality that attended the making of the law, including the rule making procedure and publication.\u2019 \u201d Moreover, a \u201clegislative\u201d regulation is enacted under the authority of an express delegation of power from the legislature....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-6\">An \u201cinterpretive\u201d regulation, in contrast, \u201csimply state[s] what the administrative agency thinks the statute means, and only \u2018remind[s]\u2019 affected parties of existing duties.\u201d While an interpretive regulation does not carry the force of law, it is entitled to deference because it reflects the agency\u2019s interpretation of its own statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b657-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 380, 927 A.2d 426 (internal citations omitted). We ultimately concluded in <em>Copes </em>that the regulations at issue should be treated as interpretative in nature, and \u201caccord[ed] appropriate deference.\u201d Our conclusion is the same here.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-8\">As in <em>Copes, </em>the pertinent regulations in the instant case went through a notice and comment period, as documented in the <em>Maryland Register. </em>The specific language now found in 25.02.02.02(D)(1)(a) was first proposed in January 1990, and adopted effective April 16, 1990. 17:1 Md. R. 93; 17:7 Md. R. 853. Although there is no express delegation of rulemaking authority to the Treasurer in the MTCA, the Treasurer is directed to \u201cadopt necessary regulations: (1) to set policies and procedures for payment on losses, including adjustment and approval; ... and (3) otherwise to carry out the duties of the Treasurer under this title.\u201d Maryland Code (2001, 2009 Repl.Vol.), State Finance and Procurement Article (\u201cSFP\u201d), \u00a7 9\u2014104(b)(1), (3). Section 9-104(a)(1) establishes that the State Treasurer is responsible for the State Insurance Program, and \u00a7 9-104(a)(2) establishes that the Treasurer is the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>administrator of the State Insurance Trust Fund, which is the source of payments for losses under the MTCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">In <em>Comptroller v. John C. Louis, Co., </em>285 Md. 527, 404 A.2d 1045 (1979), the Court of Appeals recognized that administrative interpretations that have been \u201cacquiesced in by the Legislature\u201d are entitled to \u201cgreat weight,\u201d although such interpretations are not binding on the courts. <em>Id. </em>at 543, 404 A.2d 1045. In that case, the Court of Appeals discussed factors that must be taken into account when determining the \u201cproper weight to be accorded an administrative interpretation or practice[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 544, 404 A.2d 1045. These factors include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-6\">the consistency of the administrative interpretation or practice with the purposes of the statute. Still another is the thoroughness, breadth, and validity of the considerations underlying the administrative interpretation or practice. The method by which the agency established its interpretation or practice reflects varying degrees of study and evaluation of the particularized problem. Thus, if an administrative interpretation has not resulted from a contested adversary proceeding ... or from a <em>promulgated </em>administrative decision, rule, regulation or department statement, it is entitled to relatively little weight. Similarly, if the administrative practice has not been publicly established, it is not entitled to substantial weight.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-7\">An additional significant factor is the consistency and length of the administrative interpretation or practice. Like an affirmative act, a failure to act can create inconsistency. When an agency fails to implement or enforce a statute in accordance with its own interpretation, it is acting inconsistently. Its failure to enforce diminishes the impact of the administrative interpretation. Accordingly, that interpretation is entitled to very little weight.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b658-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 544-45, 404 A.2d 1045 (internal citations omitted) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-9\">We conclude that COMAR 25.02.02.02 is entitled to substantial weight. As noted, it is an administrative regula<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>tion, promulgated by the office in charge of handling MTCA claims (the State Treasurer), and, prior to its final adoption, the regulation was subject to a public notice and comment period. It has existed for over twenty years. As stated earlier, we have not been directed to, nor are we aware of, a published decision of either appellate court interpreting the claim limit provisions of the MTCA in the manner appellants urge. On the contrary, Maryland cases have consistently held that, as the Court of Appeals recognized in <em>Proctor v. WMA-TA, </em>412 Md. 691, 713, 990 A.2d 1048 (2010), among the \u201cnotable features\u201d of the MTCA is that \u201cthe State retains its immunity for damages arising out of a single claim or occurrence in excess of $200,000.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">In reaching this conclusion, we necessarily reject the appellants\u2019 argument that the legislative history of the MTCA demands a different interpretation of the statute. Appellants point out that the limits on liability under the MTCA prior to 1985 \u201cwere $100,000 per individual claim and $500,000 per total claims arising from the same occurrence.\u201d Amendments to the MTCA later provided that sovereign immunity was waived to the extent of insurance coverage carried by the State. In 1999, the Maryland legislature again amended the statute to its current form. Citing this series of events, appellants argue that \u201cit is evident that the Legislature did not intend the current statute to include an aggregate limit on the total value of all claims by all claimants arising from a single incident,\u201d and the General Assembly \u201cspecifically did away with the aggregate limit ... evidencing the legislative intent that there be no such limit.\u201d The appellants urge us to conclude that \u201c[t]he Legislature had just done away with a much higher $500,000 aggregate cap in a stated effort to <em>bnroaden </em>liability. Applying the much lower $200,000 cap in an aggregate fashion, as the State suggests would be a comparative <em>lessening </em>of <em>liability\u2014the exact opposite of the legislative intent.\u201d </em>We disagree. In our view, the clear intent of the General Assembly in eliminating the \u201cper occurrence language\u201d was indeed to broaden the State\u2019s liability, but to do so by permitting recovery by multiple individuals who sustained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>bodily injury in the same occurrence up to a limit of $200,000 per injured party. It was not the legislative intent, however, to allow an unlimited number of derivative claimants each to recover up to $200,000 for bodily injury to a single person in a single occurrence.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">The COMAR provisions are consistent with the purposes of the MTCA. Although SG \u00a7 12-102 requires the MTCA to be \u201cconstrued broadly, to ensure that injured parties have a remedy,\u201d it is also the case that waivers of sovereign immunity are strictly construed in favor of the State. <em>Bd. of Educ. v. Zimmer-Rubert, </em>409 Md. 200, 212, 973 A.2d 233 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">The COMAR provisions are also consistent with holdings by our appellate courts in other cases. In <em>Board of County Commissioners of St. Mary\u2019s County v. Marcas, LLC, </em>415 Md. 676, 687, 4 A.3d 946 (2010), a case interpreting the LGTCA, the Court concluded \u201cthat the General Assembly intended that courts would use the insurance industry\u2019s definitions of \u2018individual claim\u2019 and \u2018same occurrence\u2019 when applying C.J. \u00a7 5-303,\u201d the LGTCA corollary to the MTCA liability limits set forth in SG \u00a7 12-104.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>See also West American Ins. Co. v. Popa, </em>352 Md. 455, 470, 723 A.2d 1 (1998) (\u201c[T]he monetary limit under the Maryland Tort Claims Act is very much like a private defendant\u2019s liability insurance limits.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">Cases interpreting \u201cper claim\u201d and \u201cper occurrence\u201d language in insurance polices have consistently held that the \u201cper claim\u201d limit sets the upper ceiling on recovery for an injury involving one person, whether it be for direct or derivative claims. One bodily injury gives rise to a claim for personal injury (if the injured party survives), or wrongful death (if he does not), and can spawn claims derivative of that single bodily injury; but one bodily injury equals one \u201cclaim.\u201d More than one bodily injury triggers the \u201cper occurrence\u201d language. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>\u201cUnder policies fixing a maximum recovery for \u2018bodily injury\u2019 to one person, the vast majority of courts have held that such a \u2018per person\u2019 liability limitation applies to all claims of damage flowing from such bodily injury. Therefore, such consequential or derivative damages are computed together with the claim for bodily injury of which they are a consequence.\u201d <em>Daley v. USAA, </em>312 Md. 550, 553-54, 541 A.2d 632 (1988) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">A similar interpretation of the per claim limit has been applied in cases arising under the LGTCA. <em>See, e.g., Surratt v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>320 Md. 439, 454, 578 A.2d 745 (1990); <em>Espina v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>215 Md.App. 611, 647, 82 A.3d 1240 (2013), <em>cert. granted sub nom., Espina v. Jackson, </em>438 Md. 142, 91 A.3d 613 (2014); <em>Leake v.

USAA, </em>supra\u2014is a \u201cwasted exercise,\u201d we have made reference in prior decisions to the \u201cCourt of Appeals\u2019 repeated statements that, in construing limitations on local government tort liability, courts should look to definitions in the insurance industry.\u201d <em>Leake, supra, </em>204 Md.App. at 413, 40 A.3d 1127. We are persuaded that interpretation of the claim limits in the MTCA deserve similar review.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that appellants are entitled to collect a total of no more than $200,000 from the State of Maryland pursuant to the MTCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-8\">JUDGMENTS OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY AFFIRMED IN PART AND VACATED IN PART. CASE REMANDED FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS NOT INCONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION. COSTS TO BE PAID ONE-HALF BY APPELLANTS AND ONE-HALF BY THE STATE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b606-8\">. The State notes in its brief: \"Unaware of that policy, the transportation detail did not intervene when the four [Supermax] inmates selected seats near each other in the rear-most compartment.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b606-9\">. The State notes in its brief that, before boarding the bus in Hagerstown, \"the inmates were strip-searched by Officers Scott and Generette,\u201d and the bus itself was searched by Officer Gaither \"for contraband and weapons,\u201d but the razor blade with which Johns later slashed Parker\u2019s neck was not discovered.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b613-22\">. An internal investigation was launched in the early-morning hours of February 2, once the bus arrived back at Supermax and Mr. Parker was taken to the hospital, where he was pronounced dead. The correctional officers on the bus were separated and directed to write a report of the bus trip; the report was called a \u201cNotice of Incident/Matter of Record.\u201d Cooper\u2019s report mentions nothing about any conversation between himself and Scott.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b619-7\">. The motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict does not appear in the record. Instead, where it should appear, there is a paper, apparently inserted by the Clerk of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City prior to the transmittal of the record to this Court, recognizing that this filing was docketed as Document # 63, but it is now \u201cMISSING/' and \"Attempts to obtain copies have been unsuccessful.\u201d The two motions for remittitur also are not in the circuit court\u2019s record; instead, a paper noting that they are \u201cMISSING\u201d appears in the court\u2019s file.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b619-8\">. We were provided no transcript of the hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b634-8\">. Moreover, although the defendants complain in their brief that \"Mr. Johns\u2019s statements about the officers\u2019 ability to see him assault the victim or hear the victim make sounds did not qualify as a declaration against interest,\u201d and therefore should not satisfy an exception to the hearsay rule, they fail to acknowledge that the trial court actually redacted these very statements from the transcribed confession before submitting it to the jury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b649-10\">. In the Notice of Termination issued to Sgt. Cooper, which came into evidence as Plaintiff's Exhibit 23, the then-Secretary of Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services wrote that the \"primary duty\u201d of the officers on the bus was \"to maintain custody, security and control of inmates under their supervision.\u201d The internal investigation revealed, in the words of the Notice of Termination, that \"Mr. Cooper was grossly negligent in the performance of his duties\u201d; that \"[Cooper\u2019s] failure to conform his behavior within acceptable standards amounts to insubordination and a reckless disregard of institutional policies and procedures\u201d; and that Cooper\u2019s \u201cperformance lapses breached the safety and security of inmate Parker and contributed to his death.\u201d The Department took action to terminate Cooper's employment on the basis of its finding that he had acted in a grossly negligent manner during and immediately after this incident.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b651-9\">. On the basis of the record before us, we cannot determine the amount of the verdict that should be eventually entered against Sgt. Cooper on remand. We hold only that Sgt. Cooper is not entitled to the protections of the MTCA or common law public official immunity. Because the trial court erred in striking the finding of gross negligence, the trial court did not address other potential grounds for remittitur. For example, there is a statute potentially applicable to this case which would cap the non-economic damage award. CJP \u00a7 11-108 imposes caps on awards of non-economic damages in personal injury cases generally. We previously noted that, although the docket entries reflect that two motions for remittitur were filed by the State on November 1, 2011, neither is present in the record or appendix for our review. We do not know for certain the grounds covered in either motion for remittitur, but the appellants\u2019 opening brief states that \"the Office of the Attorney General filed [post trial] motions seeking to reduce the State\u2019s liability to $200,000 and Defendant Cooper\u2019s liability to the much higher limit under Section 11-108 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b655-6\">. The trial court rejected another of the appellants\u2019 arguments, namely that there were also three separate incidents (misconduct on the day of the murder, misconduct the day prior and the State\u2019s negligence in failing to properly train and supervise its employees) that should entitle them to separate sets of limits on liability for each incident. Appellants failed to raise any challenge to this aspect of the trial court's decision in their opening brief. The argument that appellants are entitled to a separate set of limits based on multiple alleged incidents is not preserved for review and will not be addressed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b655-7\">. Although the alleged conflict between the statute and the regulation was briefed in <em>Goss v. Estate of Jennings, </em>207 Md.App. 151, 175, 51 A.3d 761 (2012), we did not address the merits of the arguments in that case. We noted that the trial court had concluded that, \"if the State were liable, a damage award would be limited to $200,000 despite the presence of multiple plaintiffs in the case,\u201d given that \"there was [only] one victim and one accident.\u201d But, because we concluded in <em>Goss </em>that the State had no liability, we did not address whether the trial court had been correct in stating that there could not be more than one award of $200,000 in a case in which there was but one victim and one accident.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b660-8\">. Maryland Code (1973, 2006 Repl.Vol.), C.J. \u00a7 5-303(a)(1) provides, in pertinent part: \"[T]he liability of a local government may not exceed $200,000 per an individual claim, and $500,000 per total claims that arise from the same occurrence....\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
