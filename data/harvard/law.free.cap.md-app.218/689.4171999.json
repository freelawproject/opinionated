The court did not ask the question, but as the court and parties recapped the questions after the court read them, the prosecutor told the court that it had in fact asked it, and Mr. Smith\u2019s counsel did not correct him. The State agrees with Mr. Smith that under <em>Moore v. State, </em>412 Md. 635, 989 A.2d 1150 (2010), the failure to ask the mandatory Defense-Witness question requires us to reverse his convictions for involuntary manslaughter and use of a handgun in the commission of a felony. The State argues nevertheless that defense counsel\u2019s failure to correct the prosecutor\u2019s misstatement to the court \u201cinvited\u201d the error, and thus Mr. Smith failed to preserve it. We disagree with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>State and reverse, and we address two other issues that are likely to recur on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">This appeal represents the latest chapter in a case that started on September 26, 2006 with the shooting death of Army Ranger Michael McQueen, Mr. Smith\u2019s then-roommate. Mr. Smith was tried and convicted once before, but the Court of Appeals reversed Mr. Smith\u2019s original convictions for depraved heart second-degree murder and use of a handgun in the commission of a felony. <em>See Smith v. State, </em>423 Md. 573, 32 A.3d 59 (2011). This appeal arises from his second trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">Between 12:00 and 1:00 a.m. on September 26, 2006, police responded to a 911 call by Mr. Smith and found him outside of the apartment he shared with Mr. McQueen. When the police arrived at the apartment, Mr. Smith was in hysterics, sitting on the sidewalk curb and covered in blood. Inside the apartment, the police found Mr. McQueen in the living room, dead from a gunshot wound to the right side of his head. His body was sitting in a chair facing a television, with a marijuana grinder in his lap and a bottle of beer, a bong, and a remote control on the floor next to the chair. Police did not find a gun next to the chair or anywhere else in the apartment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b718-8\">Police took Mr. Smith into custody and began questioning him at approximately 3:30 a.m. During the interrogation, Mr. Smith accounted for his contact with Mr. McQueen over the course of the evening. The pair began the evening by smoking marijuana in their apartment before going to several bars and consuming multiple alcoholic beverages. Mr. Smith then gave three different versions of the events that transpired after he and Mr. McQueen left the bars.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-9\">In the first version, Mr. Smith dropped Mr. McQueen off at the apartment before driving to his mother\u2019s house to pick up some clothes. Upon returning, Mr. Smith said he found Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>McQueen dead in the chair and dialed 911. Mr. Smith alluded to some potential suspects and stated that he did not keep any weapons in the apartment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">In the second version of events, Mr. Smith described how he came home from his mother\u2019s house to find Mr. McQueen dead with a .38 gun on the floor next to his hand. Mr. Smith testified that he owned the gun and realized that his fingerprints would be on the gun and ammunition. Mr. Smith said that he panicked, took the gun, and threw it away in a nearby lake. After disposing of the weapon, he returned to the apartment and called the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">After the interrogating officers pressed Mr. Smith regarding inconsistencies in his stories, Mr. Smith offered a third version. This time, Mr. Smith said that he had put the .38 inside the laundry basket at his mother\u2019s house, then went back to his apartment. Mr. McQueen was watching television, and Mr. Smith then took the gun out of the laundry basket and placed it on the floor, warning him that the gun was loaded. Mr. Smith proceeded to use the back bathroom in the rear of the apartment; as he was exiting the bathroom, he heard a gunshot and came out to see blood coming out of Mr. McQueen\u2019s head. Upon seeing the body, Mr. Smith grabbed the gun and threw it away in the nearby lake, then returned to the apartment and called the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">Mr. Smith was convicted at trial for depraved heart second-degree murder and use of a handgun in the commission of a felony, but the Court of Appeals reversed the conviction and remanded the case for a new trial. The second trial began on August 30, 2012 and lasted through September 17, 2012. The main issue at trial was whether Mr. McQueen\u2019s death was a homicide or suicide, and both the State and Mr. Smith presented a large amount of witnesses and evidence in support of their respective theories. The jury convicted Mr. Smith of involuntary manslaughter and use of a handgun in the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>mission of a felony on September 19, 2012. Mr. Smith filed a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">Mr. Smith raises six issues on appeal, but our resolution of the first limits the number we need to address.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We hold that the trial court\u2019s failure to ask the Defense-Witness question during <em>voir dire </em>requires us to reverse Mr. Smith\u2019s convictions. Additionally, and to guide the circuit court on remand, we hold that the trial court erred in admitting the unfairly prejudicial gun ownership and ammunition bag evidence, but we find no abuse of discretion in the court\u2019s decision to admit testimony regarding a witness\u2019s prior encounter with Mr. Smith.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">A. The Trial Judge Committed Reversible Error When It Refused To Ask The Defense-Witness <em>Voir Dire </em>Question.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">Mr. Smith begins by arguing that the trial judge committed reversible error by refusing to ask his Defense-Witness <em>voir dire </em>question. The State does not dispute that the question was mandatory, that Mr. Smith asked the court to ask it, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>that omitting the question normally requires reversal. Instead, the State argues that Mr. Smith waived any complaint about the omission by \u201cinviting\u201d the court\u2019s error when defense counsel did not catch and correct the <em>State\u2019s </em>misstatement to the court. We decline to hold defense counsel responsible for the State\u2019s mistake.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">Under Maryland law, \u201cif a question is \u2018directed to a specific cause for disqualification\u2019 then the question must be asked and failure to do so is an \u2018abuse of discretion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Moore v. State, </em>412 Md. 635, 654, 989 A.2d 1150 (2010) (quoting <em>Casey v. Roman Catholic Archbishop of Balt., </em>217 Md. 595, 605, 143 A.2d 627 (1958)). An abuse of discretion in this context is reversible error. <em>Id. </em>at 668, 989 A.2d 1150 (citations omitted). During <em>voir dire, </em>Mr. Smith asked the court to ask the following question (the \u201cDefense-Witness question\u201d) designed to identify jurors who might harbor a bias against defense witnesses:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-6\">Is there any member of the panel who would be less likely to believe a witness simply because they were called by the defense?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">The trial judge omitted this question from <em>voir dire </em>intentionally, and for two reasons: because \u201cthe issue in the question was ... raised by another question\u201d and because the court \u201cfound the question to be inappropriate for voir dire.\u201d Following <em>voir dire, </em>the court asked the parties to make any objections they had concerning omitted <em>voir dire </em>questions. Counsel for Mr. Smith then identified different omitted <em>voir dire </em>questions with which he took issue. In response to each question, the trial judge stated whether he had asked the question or explained his reasoning for why he did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-8\">Among these objections, Mr. Smith expressly challenged the omission of the Defense-Witness <em>voir dire </em>question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A0R\">[COUNSEL FOR MR. SMITH]: And then [the Defense-Witness <em>voir dire </em>question].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-9\">[COUNSEL FOR THE STATE]: You\u2019ve already asked that question. If you\u2019ll believe the credibility equally on both sides.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>THE COURT: That issue has been covered, just different words[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">After Mr. Smith went through all of the questions whose omission he challenged, the Court proceeded to swear the prospective jurors into the jury. The trial judge asked the defense three times whether it was satisfied with the jury; each time, counsel for Mr. Smith expressed satisfaction qualified by the exceptions he had made at the bench.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">Maryland Rule 4-323(c) governs the \u201cmanner of objections during jury selection,\u201d including objections made during <em>voir dire. Marquardt v. State, </em>164 Md.App. 95, 142, 882 A.2d 900 (2005) (citing <em>Baker v. State, </em>157 Md.App. 600, 609, 610, 853 A.2d 796 (2004); <em>Newman v. State, 156 </em>Md.App. 20, 50-51, 845 A.2d 71 (2003), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>384 Md. 285, 863 A.2d 321 (2004)). In order to object to a trial court ruling made during <em>voir dire,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-6\">it is sufficient that a party, at the time the ruling or order is made or sought, makes known to the court the action that the party desires the court to take or the objection to the action of the court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">Md. Rule 4-323(c); <em>see also Marquardt, </em>164 Md.App. at 143, 882 A.2d 900. This objection does not need to be a formal exception to the ruling, Md. Rule 4\u2014323(d); rather, the objector simply needs to make \u201cknown to the circuit court \u2018what [is] wanted done.\u2019 \u201d <em>Marquardt, </em>164 Md.App. at 143, 882 A.2d 900 (quoting <em>Baker, </em>157 Md.App. at 610, 853 A.2d 796).</p>\n<p id=\"b722-8\">In past cases involving excluded <em>voir dire </em>questions, we have interpreted Rule 4-323 to require objectors only to notify the trial court of their objections, not to explain or pursue their objections. The Court in <em>Neuman </em>did not require such an \u201cobjection to be stated with particularity or specific language\u201d to meet the requirements of Rule 4-323. 156 Md.App. at 51, 845 A.2d 71. An appellant preserves the issue of omitted <em>voir dire </em>questions under Rule 4-323 by telling the trial court that he or she objects to his or her proposed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>questions not being asked. <em>Marquardt, </em>164 Md.App. at 143, 882 A.2d 900.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b723-4\">There can be no serious dispute that Mr. Smith objected to the omission of the Defense-Witness question. During the time that the trial court set aside for objections to omitted <em>voir dire </em>questions, Mr. Smith listed several omitted questions, and the trial court ruled on each. With regard to the Defense-Witness question, the trial court agreed with the State\u2019s contention that the thrust of question was covered by a question already asked by Mr. Smith. Under both the plain language of Rule 4-323(c) &amp; (d) and the case law applying the Rule, raising the omitted question preserved Mr. Smith\u2019s objection to the omission, and Mr. Smith was not obligated to further pursue his objection regarding the exclusion of the question to preserve the issue for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">1. Invited error</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">Nevertheless, the State contends that Mr. Smith \u201cinvited\u201d the court\u2019s error when he did not correct \u201ca factual misstatement by the prosecutor.\u201d Under the \u201cinvited error\u201d doctrine, \u201c \u2018a defendant who himself invites or creates error cannot obtain a benefit\u2014mistrial or reversal\u2014from that error.\u2019\u201d <em>State v. Rich, </em>415 Md. 567, 575, 3 A.3d 1210 (2010) (quoting <em>Klauenberg v. State, </em>355 Md. 528, 544, 735 A.2d 1061 (1999)). According to the State, the court was misled into thinking that the Defense-Witness question had been asked, and Mr. Smith\u2019s failure to identify the error to the court waived any objection to the omission.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">The State\u2019s \u201cinvited error\u201d argument would, were we to adopt it, extend a reasonable anti-sandbagging principle to an absurd and unfair extreme. The invited error doctrine makes sense where an <em>affirmative </em>act of the appellant produced the error he raises on appeal. For example, our courts have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>applied the invited error doctrine correctly where the alleged error arose from jury instructions the appellant requested, <em>see id. </em>at 581, 3 A.3d 1210; <em>Olson v. State, </em>208 Md.App. 309, 363-66, 56 A.3d 576 (2012), <em>cert. denied, </em>430 Md. 646, 62 A.3d 731 (2013); <em>Wimbish v. State, </em>201 Md.App. 239, 264-65, 29 A.3d 635 (2011), <em>cert. denied, </em>424 Md. 293, 35 A.3d 489 (2012), from the appellant\u2019s own jury tampering, <em>see Ruth v. State, </em>133 Md.App. 358, 370-74, 757 A.2d 152 (2000); <em>Allen v. State, </em>89 Md.App. 25, 43-45, 597 A.2d 489 (1991), or testimony the appellant had elicited on cross-examination. <em>See Murdock v. State, </em>175 Md.App. 267, 294 n. 8, 927 A.2d 53 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">In contrast, the State argues here that Mr. Smith \u201cinvited the court\u2019s error\u201d by remaining \u201csilent in the face of a factual misstatement by the <em>prosecutor.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). The <em>State </em>made the misstatement, not the defendant, and yet the State asks us to find that Mr. Smith waived an objection his counsel made repeatedly (and that the circuit court had ample responsibility to address) because his counsel did not catch and correct <em>the State\u2019s </em>error. We decline to make that leap. The broader principle underlying our preservation decisions focuses on whether the party objecting on appeal gave the circuit court a proper opportunity to avoid or resolve errors during the trial, not on hyper-technicalities. In this case, Mr. Smith\u2019s counsel asked the court to ask potential jurors the Defense-Witness question, and the court decided (for reasons we evaluate next) not to ask it. The prosecutor\u2019s mistake appeared to be an honest one, and we do not mean to suggest any impropriety in the prosecutor\u2019s statement that the question had already been asked\u2014there was a lot going on at that point in the process, and to us the transcript reveals a straightforward misunderstanding. It is neither fair nor consistent with our preservation cases, though, to bootstrap the <em>State\u2019s </em>mistake into a waiver of Mr. Smith\u2019s otherwise well-preserved objections, particularly since, as we address next, the question at issue is a mandatory question.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">2. Defense-Witness <em>voir dire </em>question</p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">A Defense-Witness question is aimed specifically at revealing bias among the prospective jurors against witnesses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>for the defense. <em>Moore, </em>412 Md. at 642, 989 A.2d 1150. Both the State and Mr. Smith agree that under <em>Moore, </em>Mr. Smith was entitled to have the trial court ask the Defense-Witness question during <em>voir dire. </em>Both parties also agree that failure of a trial court to ask a requested Defense-Witness question \u201cis not, by definition, harmless\u201d error and that such an omission necessarily requires a new trial, <em>id. </em>at 668, 989 A.2d 1150, and we agree as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">A Defense-Witness question \u201cfalls within the very core of the purpose of <em>voir dire, </em>[because] it is designed to uncover venireperson bias.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 663, 989 A.2d 1150. Mr. Smith\u2019s Defense-Witness question specifically addressed juror preconceptions of defense witnesses as presumptively less credible, a perception that would directly infringe upon Mr. Smith\u2019s right to an impartial and fair trial. <em>Id. </em>\u201c[A] trial court must question the venire and consider whether any of the answers reveal such a bias\u201d in a prospective juror. <em>Id. </em>at 664, 989 A.2d 1150. For these reasons, failing to ask the Defense\u2014Witness question\u2014which was not covered by other questions the court did ask\u2014constitutes an abuse of discretion by the trial court. <em>Id. </em>at 667-68, 989 A.2d 1150. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the circuit court and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">B. The Trial Court Erred In Admitting Evidence Of Mr. Smith\u2019s Gun Ownership And A Bag Of Ammunition Found In The Apartment Shared By Mr. Smith And The Victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">Although we could stop here, we address two of Mr. Smith\u2019s other appellate questions that are likely to recur if he is tried again on remand. Among his remaining issues, Mr. Smith argues that the court erred in admitting evidence relating to eight firearms that he owned and to ammunition found in Mr. Smith\u2019s apartment. Mr. Smith argued at trial that this evidence was irrelevant and unfairly prejudicial because the weapons and ammunition were unrelated to the shooting in question. The court admitted the evidence over <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>Mr. Smith\u2019s objections, emphasizing how \u201c[i]t\u2019s not illegal to have other guns and other ammo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">Our review of the trial court\u2019s decision to admit the evidence involves two steps of analysis. \u201c \u2018First, we consider whether the evidence is legally relevant, a conclusion of law which we review <em>de novo.\u2019 \u201d Brethren Mut. Ins. Co. v. Suchoza, </em>212 Md.App. 43, 52, 66 A.3d 1073 (2013) (quoting <em>Wash. Metro. Area Transit Auth. v. Washington, </em>210 Md.App. 439, 451, 63 A.3d 609 (2013)). To qualify as relevant, evidence must tend \u201cto make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d Md. Rule 5-401. Evidence that is relevant is admissible, but the trial court does have not discretion to admit evidence that is not relevant. Md. Rule 5-402; <em>State v. Simms, </em>420 Md. 705, 724, 25 A.3d 144 (2011). After determining whether the evidence in question is relevant, we look to whether the court \u201c \u2018abused its discretion by admitting relevant evidence which should have been excluded\u2019 \u201d as unfairly prejudicial. <em>Brethren Mut. Ins. Co., </em>212 Md.App. at 52, 66 A.3d 1073 (quoting <em>Wash. Metro. Area Transit Auth., </em>210 Md.App. at 451, 63 A.3d 609).</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">Two characteristics of relevant evidence are \u201c \u2018materiality and probative value.\u2019 \u201d <em>Williams v. State, </em>342 Md. 724, 737, 679 A.2d 1106 (1996) (quoting <em>State v. Joynes, </em>314 Md. 113, 119, 549 A.2d 380 (1988)). Evidence is material if it bears on a fact of consequence to an issue in the case. <em>Id. </em>at 736-37, 679 A.2d 1106 (quoting <em>Joynes, </em>314 Md. at 119, 549 A.2d 380). Probative value relates to the strength of the connection between the evidence and the issue, to the tendency of the evidence \u201c \u2018to establish the proposition that it is offered to prove.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 737, 679 A.2d 1106 (quoting <em>Joynes, </em>314 Md. at 119, 549 A.2d 380).</p>\n<p id=\"b726-7\">It is not enough, though, for evidence to be relevant. Under Maryland Rule 5-403, the trial court should exclude relevant evidence if the probative value of the evidence \u201c \u2018is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.\u2019 \u201d <em>See Carter v. State, </em>374 Md. 693, 705, 824 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>123 (2003) (quoting <em>Andrews v. State, </em>372 Md. 1, 19, 811 A.2d 282 (2002)). \u201c \u2018Evidence is prejudicial when it tends to have some adverse effect ... beyond tending to prove the fact or issue that justified its admission.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hannah v. State, </em>420 Md. 339, 347, 23 A.3d 192 (2011) (quoting <em>King v. State, </em>407 Md. 682, 704, 967 A.2d 790 (2009)). We determine whether a particular piece of evidence is unfairly prejudicial by balancing the inflammatory character of the evidence against the utility the evidence will provide to the jurors\u2019 evaluation of the issues in the case. In order to admit evidence of a \u201chighly incendiary nature,\u201d the evidence must greatly aid the \u201cjury\u2019s understanding of why the defendant was the person who committed the particular crime charged.\u201d <em>Gutierrez v. State, </em>423 Md. 476, 495, 499, 32 A.3d 2 (2011) (declining to admit evidence describing the defendant\u2019s gang as more violent than other gangs). A court should <em>not, </em>however, admit evidence possessing weak probative value if the evidence might produce a jury inference that the defendant \u201chad a propensity to commit crimes\u201d or \u201cwas a person of general criminal character.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>342 Md. at 738, 679 A.2d 1106 (excluding defendant\u2019s crow bar and mace from evidence when the investigation of the scene of the burglary revealed no indication of a break in, forced entry, or any other link to the crimes with which the defendant was charged). We exclude prejudicial evidence to avoid the possibility \u201cthat a jury will convict the defendant \u2018because of something other than what he did in that case ... because of his criminal propensity.\u2019 \u201d <em>Snyder v. State, </em>210 Md.App. 370, 395, 63 A.3d 128 (2013) (quoting <em>Odum v. State, </em>412 Md. 593, 611, 989 A.2d 232 (2010), <em>cert. denied, </em>432 Md. 470, 69 A.3d 476 (2013)).</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">Although there was nothing illegal about Mr. Smith owning guns and ammunition, the evidence the court admitted regarding Mr. Smith\u2019s ownership of unrelated firearms and ammunition was minimally relevant, at best, and highly prejudicial, and should have been excluded from the trial of these charges. Neither the State nor the trial judge articulated how this evidence was relevant to whether Mr. Smith committed the alleged crimes. The fact that Mr. Smith legally possessed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>guns and ammunition does not make the weapons relevant to the victim\u2019s death, and we cannot see from this record how the inclusion of this evidence would help prove the offense charged. Without a more direct or tangible connection to the events surrounding <em>this shooting, </em>the evidence of the other weapons and ammunition owned by Mr. Smith failed the probativity/prejudice balancing test, and the trial court erred by admitting it.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">C. The Trial Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion In Admitting Testimony About A Prior Incident In Which Mr. Smith Mishandled A Gun And Was Reprimanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\"><em>Finally, </em>we address Mr. Smith\u2019s argument that the court erred in admitting testimony from Mr. Sutherland regarding Mr. Smith\u2019s handling of a gun at a barbecue in 2005. Mr. Smith asserts that the testimony suggested that he had a propensity to handle loaded weapons in an irresponsible manner, conduct that reflected negatively on his character. The State responds that Mr. Sutherland\u2019s testimony helped to demonstrate Mr. Smith\u2019s awareness of the consequences of mishandling a weapon. The testimony in question occurred during the trial on September 5, 2012:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-7\">[COUNSEL FOR THE STATE]: Okay. Getting back to the states and socializing with Gary Smith, was there a time when you or Gary Smith, socially, where he displayed a handgun?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-8\">[MR. SUTHERLAND]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-9\">[COUNSEL FOR THE STATE]: All right. Tell us about that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b728-10\">Mr. Smith objected to questioning about this topic, but the trial judge overruled his objection. Mr. Sutherland proceeded to describe an incident where he witnessed Mr. Smith mishandling a handgun at a cookout:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-11\">[MR. SUTHERLAND]: Okay. A grilling out. It was on, on post housing. It was a, like a town home, a townhouse type setup. And we were in the, the livingroom in the back of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>the house watching TV. And I was sitting on, it was kind of like a couch, like a futon type thing, if I recall. And he was sitting to my right and he had what appeared to be, to me, it was like a, like a collapsible stock type pistol with a clip. I don\u2019t know what kind of gun it was. I\u2019m not really into guns. I just remember that it was like, I think it was like a semi-automatic. Anyways\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-5\">[COUNSEL FOR THE STATE]: A handgun?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-6\">[MR. SUTHERLAND]: A handgun. It was a handgun, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-7\">[COUNSEL FOR THE STATE]: All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-8\">[MR. SUTHERLAND]: Like .9, .9 mm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-9\">[COUNSEL FOR THE STATE]: All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-10\">[MR. SUTHERLAND]: And you know, he, I don\u2019t know, he liked to pull it out. He was showing it, showing it off to us. And, and kind of, you know, fondling it and loading it. And\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-11\">[COUNSEL FOR THE STATE]: Loading it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-12\">[MR. SUTHERLAND]: Yes. Oh, yeah, he was putting, putting ... the bullets, actually, in the, in the clip. [COUNSEL FOR THE STATE]: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-13\">[MR. SUTHERLAND]: And I, I didn\u2019t, yeah, there was that time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-14\">[COUNSEL FOR THE STATE]: All right. So tell us what happened when he was loading the weapon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-15\">[MR. SUTHERLAND]: I didn\u2019t think he was being real safe with it. He had it kind of pointed kind of towards my leg while he was messing with it. I gave him a look. It wasn\u2019t really like any words exchanged, more of like gesturing. And\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-16\">[COUNSEL FOR THE STATE]: Explain your gesture.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AfL\">[MR. SUTHERLAND]: Well, it was like, kind of like, \u201cWhat are you doing, man?[\u201d] And, and, and his reaction was, like, you know, like he\u2019s got a, he\u2019s got a handle on it, like it\u2019s no big deal, so.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b730-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>On cross-examination, Mr. Sutherland clarified aspects of his testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-4\">[COUNSEL FOR MR. SMITH]: Okay. And you said he was already loading a weapon?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-5\">[MR. SUTHERLAND]: No. No. No. He, when he first sat down, he brought it out, you know, we saw it. And, you know, he had it in his hand. But no, it wasn\u2019t immediate. It was not immediate that he was loading it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-6\">[COUNSEL FOR MR. SMITH]: Okay. So at some point, he brings it out\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-7\">[MR. SUTHERLAND]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-8\">[COUNSEL FOR MR. SMITH]: \u2014and it\u2019s not loaded?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-9\">[MR. SUTHERLAND]: As far as I know, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-10\">[COUNSEL FOR MR. SMITH]: Okay. And so he reaches over and he takes some bullets and he\u2019s starting to put them in a clip.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-11\">[MR. SUTHERLAND]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-12\">[COUNSEL FOR MR. SMITH]: Is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-13\">[MR. SUTHERLAND]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-14\">[COUNSEL FOR MR. SMITH]: And did he put the clip back into the gun or just still\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-15\">[MR. SUTHERLAND]: I don\u2019t recall.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-16\">[COUNSEL FOR MR. SMITH]: Okay. So that,\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-17\">[MR. SUTHERLAND]: Uh-huh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-18\">[COUNSEL FOR MR. SMITH]: \u2014if you don\u2019t recall, then what happens is, is that he may be\u2014There\u2019s one of two scenarios, right? Either he put the clip back into the gun or the gun did not even have the clip in it. That\u2019s what you\u2019re really telling us, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-19\">[MR. SUTHERLAND]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-20\">[COUNSEL FOR MR. SMITH]: One or the other?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-21\">[MR. SUTHERLAND]: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-22\">[COUNSEL FOR MR. SMITH]: But whatever it is, whether the gun was empty\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>[MR. SUTHERLAND]: Uh-huh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-5\">[COUNSEL FOR MR. SMITH]: \u2014or the gun had a clip in it,\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-6\">[MR. SUTHERLAND]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-7\">[COUNSEL FOR MR. SMITH]: \u2014it was, as he\u2019s sitting there, this is all casual stuff, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-8\">[MR. SUTHERLAND]: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-9\">[COUNSEL FOR MR. SMITH]: And it\u2019s, it was, the gun, in some fashion, was pointed towards your knee?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-10\">[MR. SUTHERLAND]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-11\">[COUNSEL FOR MR. SMITH]: Right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-12\">[MR. SUTHERLAND]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-13\">[COUNSEL FOR MR. SMITH]: Okay. And so you had a look because you saw a barrel pointed, it didn\u2019t matter where, the knee or whatever, towards you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-14\">[MR. SUTHERLAND]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-15\">[COUNSEL FOR MR. SMITH]: You sort of looked at him, and it was like, and that was the gesture or whatever following, and that was the end of it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-16\">[MR. SUTHERLAND]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-17\">[COUNSEL FOR MR. SMITH]: And that\u2019s the end of the whole incident, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-18\">[MR. SUTHERLAND]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b731-19\">Maryland Rule 5-404(b) limits evidence of a defendant\u2019s prior \u201cbad act[s],\u201d and specifically precludes bad acts evidence offered for the purpose of proving that the defendant\u2019s character \u201cin order to show action in conformity therewith.\u201d Md. Rule 5-404(b); <em>Klauenberg v. State, </em>355 Md. 528, 546, 735 A.2d 1061 (1999). A \u201cbad act\u201d is an act or conduct \u201cthat tends to impugn or reflect adversely upon one\u2019s character, taking into consideration the facts of the underlying lawsuit.\u201d <em>Klauenberg, </em>355 Md. at 549, 735 A.2d 1061. This rule plays a role similar to the prohibition against unfairly prejudicial evidence, <em>i.e., </em>to prevent the jury from \u201c \u2018developing a predisposition of guilt\u2019 \u201d based on unrelated conduct of the defendant. <em>Sinclair v. State, </em>214 Md.App. 309, 334, 76 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>A.3d 442 (2013) (quoting <em>State v. Faulkner, </em>314 Md. 630, 633, 552 A.2d 896 (1989)).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">Although \u201cbad act\u201d evidence is inadmissible to prove a defendant\u2019s criminal character, Rule 5-404(b) does allow \u201cbad act\u201d evidence that has \u201cspecial relevance\u2014that it \u2018is substantially relevant to some contested issue.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wynn v. State, </em>351 Md. 307, 316, 718 A.2d 588 (1998) (quoting <em>State v. Taylor, </em>347 Md. 363, 368, 701 A.2d 389 (1997)). \u201cBad act\u201d evidence has a \u201cspecial relevance if it shows notice, intent, preparation, common scheme or plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.\u201d <em>Id.; </em>Md. Rule 5-404(b). Whether \u201cbad act\u201d evidence demonstrates one of these alternate purposes is a \u201c \u2018legal determination and does not involve any exercise of discretion\u2019 \u201d by the trial court; we review this determination <em>de novo. Wynn, </em>351 Md. at 317, 718 A.2d 588 (quoting <em>Faulkner, </em>314 Md. at 634, 552 A.2d 896).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">This leads to a two-step analysis. If we determine that the \u201cbad act\u201d evidence in question has special relevance, then we balance the probative value of and need for the evidence against the likelihood of undue prejudice.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201c \u2018This segment of the analysis implicates the exercise of the trial court\u2019s discretion,\u2019 \u201d and we will only reverse the court\u2019s balancing determination if the court abused its discretion. <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Faulkner, </em>314 Md. at 634-35, 552 A.2d 896).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">In this case, Mr. Sutherland\u2019s testimony included \u201cbad act\u201d evidence that reflected adversely upon Mr. Smith\u2019s character. Mr. Sutherland depicted Mr. Smith as irresponsible and unsafe in handling loaded weapons, which could encourage the jury to infer that Mr. Smith acted in conformance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>with this character on the night in question. Unless the testimony has an additional quality of special relevance to an issue in the case, then, it should have been excluded under Rule 5-404(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">The State argues here that this \u201cbad act\u201d has special relevance because it put Mr. Smith on notice of the injurious consequences of mishandling a weapon. As part of its burden of proving involuntary manslaughter, the State needed to demonstrate that Mr. Smith was aware of the risks to Mr. McQueen from mishandling a firearm. The State asserts that Mr. Sutherland\u2019s testimony was highly probative of Mr. Smith\u2019s knowledge of these risks. Although it is a close call, we ultimately find no abuse of discretion in the circuit court\u2019s decision to admit Mr. Sutherland\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">In <em>Duckworth v. State, </em>323 Md. 532, 594 A.2d 109 (1991), a battery case in which the defendant allegedly shot a child after his gun accidentally discharged, the trial court admitted testimony that, in a separate incident one week prior, the defendant had accidentally shot the child with a BB gun. <em>Id. </em>at 544, 594 A.2d 109. The Court of Appeals held that the testimony of the prior BB gun shooting was \u201cclearly relevant\u201d to show the defendant\u2019s recklessness in later pointing a gun at the child. <em>Id. </em>(\u201c[T]he jury could conclude that the accidental discharge of the BB gun in the earlier incident was a warning to [the defendant] that should have reinforced the need for substantial caution when handling firearms.\u201d). And the defendant\u2019s failure to heed the warning generated from the earlier BB gun shooting \u201cexacerbated the recklessness involved in the crime charged.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">The court in <em>Duckworth </em>held that the first shooting event put the defendant on notice as to the need for caution when handling guns. The same concept applies here, but the two cases are not perfect parallels. In <em>Duckworth, </em>the two incidents both resulted in the victim being shot and took place within one week of each other. <em>Id. </em>By contrast, the Smith-Sutherland encounter occurred a year earlier and involved a totally different victim. Moreover, the prior act in <em>Duckworth </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>was an actual shooting, whereas the prior act here took the form of a silent gesture or look by Mr. Sutherland and a silent response by Mr. Smith. <em>Id. </em>Nevertheless, Mr. Smith\u2019s encounter with Mr. Sutherland could well have imparted to Mr. Smith a warning about the need for caution when handling a weapon and demonstrated his awareness of the risks of mishandling a weapon, even if the relevance to the charges is less obvious than Mr. Duckworth\u2019s \u201cbad act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">For our purposes, though, the parallel need not be perfect. The trial court is charged with weighing the probative value of Mr. Sutherland\u2019s testimony against the likelihood of unfair prejudice. We find the question a close one, but find no abuse of discretion in the court\u2019s decision to allow Mr. Sutherland to testify about the prior incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY REVERSED AND REMANDED FOR PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION.
