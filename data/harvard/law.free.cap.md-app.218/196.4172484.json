The court sentenced appellant to a term of imprisonment totaling 65 years.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>On appeal, appellant presents three questions for our review, which we have rephrased slightly as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-5\">1. Did the circuit court abuse its discretion and violate appellant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to a public trial by closing the courtroom during the testimony of five undercover police officers?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-6\">2. Was the evidence sufficient to support appellant\u2019s drug kingpin convictions?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-7\">3. Did the circuit court err in imposing separate sentences for the convictions of volume dealing and possession with intent to distribute?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">For the reasons set forth below, we agree with appellant that his convictions for volume dealing merge, for sentencing purposes, with the convictions for possession with intent to distribute. Accordingly, we shall vacate the volume dealing sentences. Otherwise, we shall affirm the judgments of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-9\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b223-10\">Detectives in the Calvert County Sheriffs Department, who worked undercover in the Drug Enforcement Unit, began investigating appellant in the summer of 2010.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> They conducted surveillance of appellant and used confidential informants to assist in investigating appellant\u2019s drug activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-11\">Detective B. conducted several controlled buys from appellant with the assistance of an informant. Detective B. observed the informant purchase narcotics from appellant, and the informant would then give the narcotics to Detective B. The informant purchased narcotics from appellant at various <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>locations: appellant\u2019s residence; the King office building (the \u201cKing Building\u201d), where appellant\u2019s business, Kyler Photo Inc., was located; a barbershop; and a wireless telephone store, adjacent to the barbershop.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">Detective B. observed appellant engage in other hand-to-hand drug transactions between July and September 2010. One such transaction occurred behind the King budding, where appellant received money from an individual in exchange for what Detective B. believed, based on his training and experience, to be narcotics.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">Detective B. also observed what he believed to be hand-to-hand drug transactions arising from the barbershop. In one transaction, an unknown male exited the barbershop, walked across the street to a gas station, and placed an item on a cooler, at which time a woman walked to the cooler, placed money there, and walked away. The unknown male then took the money and returned to the barbershop.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">On several other occasions, Detective B. observed individuals pull in front of the barbershop, exit their vehicles, and go into the barbershop for such a short period of time that it was \u201cimpossible for them to get a haircut.\u201d At times, the visitors to the barbershop spent more time looking for a parking space than they spent inside the shop. Although the barbershop offered only men\u2019s haircuts, women were seen entering the shop alone and leaving several minutes later. Detective B. recognized several of the individuals he observed entering and quickly leaving the shop from prior CDS cases. Based on the visitor traffic at the shop, including the cars pulling in front of the shop and the drivers entering only briefly, Detective B. believed that the activity he witnessed was consistent with illegal drug activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">Detective B. saw appellant at the barbershop on approximately 20 occasions during his investigation. Appellant often visited the shop following days when there was a lull in activity. After his visit, however, traffic would pick up again. Appellant typically was inside the shop for approximately 30 minutes, although he stayed for one to two hours during <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>several visits. Sometimes, he would enter and leave the shop carrying a gym bag or a suitcase.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">Detective B. also observed activity that was consistent with illegal drug transactions at the wireless telephone store owned by appellant. After customers entered the wireless shop, they left without a bag, cell phone, or any other merchandise one would expect to be sold at a wireless store. The shop itself did not contain any cell phone or cell phone related merchandise; the only merchandise in the shop was clothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">Corporal P. assisted with the investigation. He conducted surveillance of appellant\u2019s activities at the King building, where the photo shop was located in Suite 220. The exterior of the shop consisted of a door with the numbers 2-2-0 on the outside; there was no indication that the business was a photo shop. Corporal P. never observed appellant enter or leave the shop with photography equipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">On October 14, 2010, four months after his investigation began, Corporal P. executed a search warrant for the photo shop, where he found evidence of drug dealing. Inside a locked, navy blue suitcase, Corporal P. found a large quantity of suspected cocaine and suspected crack cocaine, \u201cseveral items used in the process to convert cocaine into crack cocaine,\u201d a digital scale, and $14,000.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Corporal P. also found materials in the premises used to package cocaine and crack cocaine, as well as a candle, a hotplate, a mixer, and pyrex measuring glasses with a charred white residue. The police also found a lease agreement for the space in which the barbershop and wireless store were located.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">Appellant was present during the search of the photo shop. His person was searched, and the police recovered money, more than 10 grams of suspected crack cocaine, and \u201cindependence cards\u201d issued to individuals other than appellant.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Cor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>poral P. testified that these cards often are used by people to pay for drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">Greg Crump, a crime scene technician, analyzed the contents of the suitcase seized. He obtained from one of the measuring cups Corporal P. seized from the photo shop one latent fingerprint, which he sent to the Charles County crime lab. Earnest Jones, a fingerprint specialist with the Charles County Sheriffs Office, testified that the print on the measuring cup was from appellant\u2019s left middle finger.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">Detective B. also obtained a search warrant for the barbershop and wireless store. No items indicative of a functioning business, such as a cash register or a receipt book, were found. The police did find receipts for phones, cell phone equipment inside of a locked filing cabinet, and a sports bag with cell phones inside.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">Detective J. executed a search warrant for appellant\u2019s home. He seized a money counter from the closet of the master bedroom, as well as 37 cell phones and two memory cards. He did not find any cameras, photo paper, or other photo printing supplies.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">Detective B. believed that appellant might have a storage unit because \u201cdrug dealers often hide currency\u201d or \u201cevidence of illegal activity\u201d in storage units. He sent subpoenas to all the area storage facilities and learned that appellant leased a storage unit less than an eighth of a mile from the barbershop, on Calvert Beach Road.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">Corporal P. obtained and executed a search warrant for the storage unit. He found appellant\u2019s personal belongings, as well as documents with appellant\u2019s and Cranston Brown\u2019s names on them, including documents identifying appellant as Mr. Brown\u2019s employer.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>On October 21, 2010, in response to a tip, Corporal P. obtained a search warrant for an additional storage unit leased by appellant. That storage unit contained a dresser, which contained a black \u201claptop style carrying case\u201d with $91,000 in cash and a piece of paper with numbers written on it. Detective G., who had conducted surveillance of appellant at the barbershop, identified the black laptop bag as the same bag that she had seen appellant carry into and out of the barbershop on at least one occasion.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">During the course of the investigation, Detective B. connected two other men to the activities at the barbershop, Antoine Savoy and Roosevelt Brooks. Mr. Savoy rented the building in which the barbershop was located, and Mr. Brooks frequented the shop every few days.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">In one controlled-buy, an undercover police detective, Detective T., arranged to purchase crack cocaine from Mr. Brooks. He went to Mr. Brooks\u2019s front yard, and Mr. Brooks told him that he \u201chad to wait for his man to show up.\u201d Mr. Brooks received a phone call, and a few minutes later, a black Mercedes pulled in front of the house. Mr. Brooks got into the vehicle, and the vehicle drove around the block. Detective B. recognized the car as one he had seen Mr. Savoy drive to and from the barbershop, and Detective T. recognized Mr. Savoy as the driver. Mr. Brooks then exited the Mercedes and sold Detective T. cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">Detective G. applied for, and received, a search warrant for Mr. Brooks\u2019s home. During the search, she found a copy of the search warrant that was executed at appellant\u2019s house.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">Sergeant Matthew McDonough, a member of the Calvert County Sheriffs Office, testified as an expert in the field of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>CDS investigations. His expertise included methods of distribution and trafficking, CDS distribution organizations, packaging, use and value of CDS and paraphernalia, and circumstances indicative of CDS distribution and/or an intent to distribute CDS.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">Sergeant McDonough explained the significance of the evidence found. Five packages recovered from the photo shop appeared to contain cocaine in its powder form, and one package contained cocaine that had \u201cbeen converted back into its base form, which is known as crack.\u201d The packing of the cocaine and crack indicated that they would each be sold for $150 to $200. Other packages of cocaine found at the photo shop, which were packaged in much larger, quarter kilo amounts, indicated that the dealer had staff to whom he would give the quarter kilos to sell.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">Other items found in the photo shop were related to drug dealing. The hotplate and baking soda found in the suitcase in the office could be used to convert powder cocaine into crack cocaine. Acetone, a component of the nail polish remover, is used to wash cocaine, i.e., to dissolve the materials used in diluting the cocaine during the process of converting the cocaine to crack. Inositol is used to dilute cocaine to increase profits to dealers.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">The independence cards in other people\u2019s names, found on appellant\u2019s person, were also indicative of drug dealing activity. Sergeant McDonough explained that it is \u201cfairly common\u201d for people who do not have cash to purchase drugs with the funds on their independence cards by giving their cards to the dealer.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">Sergeant McDonough stated that the large amount of money recovered from the laptop bag in the storage unit, $91,000, as well as the \u201csubstantial amount of cocaine,\u201d indicated that appellant had sold a portion of an even larger amount of cocaine and was in the process of selling the remaining portion. He opined that the piece of paper that was found with the money appeared to be a ledger, where appellant kept track of money going in and out.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>With respect to appellant\u2019s visits to Mr. Brown, and his deposits into Mr. Brown\u2019s commissary accounts, Sergeant McDonough stated: \u201cIf a person is a standup person, does not give information to law enforcement and goes ahead and eats the charge or takes the arrest and goes to jail,\u201d then \u201cthe individual(s) who did not get charged will sometimes help out that person by putting money into their commissaries.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">Evidence that appellant had spent over $18,000 on rental cars over the course of 18 months was also significant to Sergeant McDonough. He explained that drug traffickers often drive different vehicles to avoid police surveillance and avoid having their personal vehicle forfeited in the event that they get caught. Drug traffickers also tend to avoid keeping any funds in a bank as an additional measure to avoid police detection. Based on the testimony and evidence presented against appellant, Sergeant McDonough opined that appellant was a mid-to-high level drug dealer.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">After the State rested its case, appellant moved for judgment of acquittal. With respect to the drug kingpin charges, counsel argued that there was insufficient evidence to establish that appellant was \u201can organizer, supervisor, financier, or manager\u201d of a drug distribution network. The State disagreed, arguing that there was evidence from which the jury could draw inferences that appellant was \u201cin a position of a supervisor, manager, organizer, [or] financier\u201d of a drug conspiracy. The court denied appellant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">Appellant then called John Boome, his cousin, who testified that appellant worked as a photographer, taking photos at events and parties. Beginning in 2006 or 2007, Mr. Boome worked, when he was available, as appellant\u2019s photography assistant, helping him photograph events on the weekends. Mr. Boome went with appellant to events, including night clubs, and accepted payments for appellant\u2019s services, which typically cost $700 or $800 for adult events, and $70 or $80 for children\u2019s parties. All of the payments for appellant\u2019s photography services were made in cash. Mr. Boome testified that appellant possessed \u201call kinds\u201d of photography equipment, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>including tripods, printers, and several cameras. The last event with which Mr. Boome helped occurred in August 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">Shemeka Cole, an event organizer, hired appellant from 2002 to 2008 to take photos at events. After she stopped working with appellant, she would still see him at events taking photographs. Appellant was always paid for his services in cash. April Harrod, appellant\u2019s ex-girlfriend, testified that appellant had a photography business called Flick It Up Photo.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">After the defense rested, the State moved into evidence several exhibits, including appellant\u2019s bank records, as well as a certificate from the Custodian of Records with the Comptroller of Maryland, which indicated that appellant had not paid income taxes in 2010.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Appellant then renewed his motion for judgment of acquittal, which the court denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">As indicated, the jury found appellant guilty of multiple drug charges. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b230-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b230-10\">Right to a Public Trial</p>\n<p id=\"b230-11\">Appellant contends that the circuit court \u201cabused its discretion and violated [his] Sixth Amendment right to a public trial\u201d when it closed \u201cthe courtroom to the public during the testimony of five undercover officers based solely on a general proffer from the State, without making the requisite case-specific findings of fact to support an \u2018overriding interest\u2019 that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>would justify the closure.\u201d He asserts that the denial of the constitutional right to a public trial is a structural defect, and therefore, we must remand his case for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">The State argues that appellant\u2019s contention is not preserved for this Court\u2019s review, noting that appellant did not object to the State\u2019s request to screen the officers from view or the court\u2019s proposed solution to close the courtroom during the testimony of the five officers. It asserts that appellant\u2019s \u201cfailure to make any noise about the State\u2019s request and the trial court\u2019s subsequent ruling invited any error that may have arisen as it negated the State\u2019s need for a more extensive proffer or the circuit court\u2019s need for more specialized findings.\u201d In any event, the State contends that the court acted \u201cwithin its discretion in allowing for the limited closure of the courtroom while instituting other accommodations for public consumption of the trial in order to protect the identities of undercover police officers during their testimony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">Proceedings Below</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">At the start of appellant\u2019s trial, the State expressed its concern regarding \u201cundercover officers who remain assigned in an undercover capacity\u201d being required to testify in \u201cthe open courtroom with their faces displayed to individuals who may be here watching the trial.\u201d The State requested that the court allow the officers to \u201ctestify from the side of the courtroom close to the jury box, screened from view of the gallery, and that precautions be made to close those portions of the courtroom that would allow them to be seen [by] individuals seated in the gallery of the courtroom.\u201d The State further requested that the court allow the officers to wear masks when they entered the courtroom, to block the view from the gallery, and then remove the masks when they were behind the screened area.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-9\">The court asked for input from appellant\u2019s counsel, and counsel replied that it would have \u201ca chilling effect in terms of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>giving [appellant] a fair trial.\u201d The following colloquy then occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-4\">THE COURT: The other alternative is we can clear the courtroom when they come in and then leave the screen up. For officer safety I think we need to have some accommodation for that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-5\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Perhaps if that can be done in such a way that\u2019s not obvious to the jury. I wouldn\u2019t have a problem with that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">The court stated that there were two options it could use to protect the identity of the officers: \u201cKeep the witness in the witness stand but clear the courtroom or have the witness testify over closest to the jury.\u201d The State clarified that either procedure would need to be employed for five witnesses, each of whom was an undercover police officer. At that point, appellant\u2019s counsel stated: \u201cI would ask the court to clear the courtroom if that\u2019s the choice.\u201d He then went on to elaborate on his election:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-7\">And again, I think given the choice, given those two choices from the defense\u2019s point of view, it\u2019s probably best to have all witnesses testify. It doesn\u2019t suggest that one witness maybe has greater importance than another. It might be a chilling effect. I don\u2019t think these jurors\u2014I think they\u2019re highly intelligent, and I think that they will perhaps view those precautions in a way that\u2019s suggestive that my client poses somehow a danger. They might misunderstand or misconstrue the purpose, and I think for those reasons, if the court\u2019s going to recognize these concerns from the [S]tate, best to have the witness testify here and we\u2019ll clear the courtroom.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">The State then expressed concern about appellant\u2019s \u201cright to have a public trial,\u201d stating: \u201cI don\u2019t want there to be an issue with respect to the lack of a public trial if certain witnesses are testifying without the public being permitted to observe.\u201d The State explained, however, that \u201cwe live in a small county and we have only so large a pool of officers to work in an undercover capacity,\u201d and as \u201c[t]hey continue in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>that assignment,\u201d their testimony raises \u201can officer safety issue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\">The court then suggested, as a way to accommodate the parties\u2019 concerns regarding officer safety and appellant\u2019s right to a public trial, that the courtroom could be closed, but individuals who wanted to listen to the testimony could do so by listening to recorded trial proceedings in another room. It believed that would resolve defense counsel\u2019s concern regarding \u201cperhaps highlighting those witnesses to the jury panel\u201d by having them testify behind a screen. The court stated that interested individuals could \u201clisten in to the trial and then they can come back and observe. So I think we\u2019ve solved both problems.\u201d Appellant\u2019s counsel voiced no objection to that arrangement.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">After speaking to the court administrator regarding setting up a listening room, the court then made the following findings, noting again its view that the proposed arrangement \u201csolves all concerns\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-6\">The court certainly makes an affirmative finding that we do live in a small community. Four or five of these witnesses are still working in an undercover capacity. It is a small community. For officer safety I think we need to make some accommodation for their safety as well as make an accommodation for a public trial for the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-7\">So the witnesses\u2014the observers will be able to listen to the testimony but not see the witnesses. And I do think [defense counsel\u2019s] comments of highlighting the witnesses either if they came in masked and sat behind a screen might highlight their testimony. So I think our jury .... will not realize that there\u2019s no one in the courtroom because there will be a rule on witnesses. So if anyone is going to be a witness, they wouldn\u2019t be allowed in the courtroom anyway. And then all of the witnesses will testify in the courtroom in the same spot.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">Appellant\u2019s counsel again voiced no objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-9\">The courtroom was closed during the testimony of the five undercover officers, and during that time, members of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>public were allowed to listen to the testimony in another courtroom. The courtroom otherwise was open during trial for public viewing.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">Waiver</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">We first address the State\u2019s preservation argument. Pursuant to Maryland Rule 8-131(a), an appellate court ordinarily \u201cwill not decide any ... issue unless it plainly appears by the record to have been raised in or decided by the trial court.\u201d The rationale for \u201cthe rule limiting the scope of appellate review to those issues and arguments raised in the court below \u2018is a matter of basic fairness to the trial court and to opposing counsel, as well as being fundamental to the proper administration of justice.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re: Kaleb K., </em>390 Md. 502, 513, 889 A.2d 1019 (2006) (quoting <em>Medley v. State, 52 </em>Md.App. 225, 231, 448 A.2d 363 (1982)).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">In <em>Robinson v. State, </em>410 Md. 91, 110, 976 A.2d 1072 (2009), the Court of Appeals held, \u201c[consistent with the vast majority of the courts that have spoken on the subject,\u201d that \u201ca claimed violation of the right to a public trial must be preserved for appellate review by a timely objection at trial.\u201d The Court stated that, although an appellate court has discretion to review an unpreserved claim of error, it should do so \u201c \u2018only when it is clear that it will not work an unfair prejudice to the parties or to the court.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 104, 976 A.2d 1072 (quoting <em>Jones v. State, </em>379 Md. 704, 714, 843 A.2d 778 (2004)). Unfair prejudice may result for several reasons, including \u201cwhen counsel fails to bring the position of [his or] her client to the attention of the trial court so \u2018that court can pass upon and correct any errors in its own proceedings.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Jones, </em>379 Md. at 714, 843 A.2d 778). Noting that \u201cthe very analysis Appellant complains was not done by the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>likely would have been done had he brought the matter to the court\u2019s attention,\u201d the Court declined to exercise its discretion under Maryland Rule 8-131(a) to address Robinson\u2019s unpreserved claim that the court erred in excluding Robinson\u2019s family from trial. <em>Id. </em>at 105, 976 A.2d 1072. It held that, under the circumstances, \u201cit would be unfair to the court and prejudicial to the State to review [Mr. Robinson\u2019s] unpreserved claim of error.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">The analysis in <em>Robinson </em>informs our decision in the present case. Here, although defense counsel expressed concern with the State\u2019s suggestion of erecting a screen to protect the identities of undercover police officers, stating that it might have \u201ca chilling effect,\u201d defense counsel voiced no objection to the procedures employed by the court. Indeed, when the court suggested clearing the courtroom and setting up an alternate listening site for members of the public during the testimony of the officers, defense counsel stated that he \u201cwouldn\u2019t have a problem with that\u201d if it was \u201cdone in such a way that\u2019s not obvious to the jury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">The State, not appellant, then addressed whether such an arrangement would implicate appellant\u2019s right to a public trial. After considering the State\u2019s concerns, as well as appellant\u2019s concerns about highlighting the testimony of the undercover officers, the court proposed a solution that would protect officer safety and address defense counsel\u2019s concern. Again, appellant voiced no objection to the court\u2019s proposal.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">Under these circumstances, it is clear that appellant\u2019s argument on appeal, that the alternative procedure employed by the court violated his constitutional right to a public trial, was not presented to the circuit court. We hold, as the Court of Appeals did in <em>Robinson, </em>410 Md. at 105, 976 A.2d 1072, that it \u201cwould be unfair to the court and prejudicial to the State to review [appellant\u2019s] unpreserved claim of error.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-9\">Drug Kingpin</p>\n<p id=\"b235-10\">Appellant next argues that the evidence was insufficient to support his drug kingpin conviction. He contends that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>\u201c[t]here was no evidence at trial from which a rational trier of fact could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that [he] organized, supervised, financed or managed Antoine Savoy, Roosevelt Brooks, or Cranston Brown in a drug conspiracy,\u201d and without such evidence, the State failed to establish the requisite elements of his drug kingpin status.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">The State disagrees. It argues that the evidence was sufficient to establish appellant\u2019s role as a drug kingpin, asserting that the evidence permitted the jury to find that appellant \u201coversaw the entire drug enterprise.\u201d The State contends that the evidence supported a finding that appellant\u2019s \u201crole was that of directing, managing, and supervising the drug conspiracy, which included a number of players,\u201d including Mr. Savoy, Mr. Brooks, and Mr. Brown.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">This Court recently set forth the applicable standard of review in determining the sufficiency of the evidence on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-6\">The test of appellate review of evidentiary sufficiency is whether, \u201c \u2018after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v.

The Court\u2019s concern is not whether the verdict is in accord with what appears to be the weight of the evidence, \u201cbut rather is only with whether the verdicts were supported with sufficient evidence\u2014that is, evidence that either showed directly, or circumstantially, or supported a rational inference of facts which could fairly convince a trier of fact of the defendant\u2019s guilt of the offense charged beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State v. Albrecht, </em>336 Md. 475, 479 [649 A.2d 336] (1994). \u201cWe \u2018must give deference to all reasonable inferences [that] the fact-finder draws, regardless of whether [the appellate court] would have chosen a different reasonable inference.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cox v.

Further, we do not \u201c \u2018distinguish between circumstantial and direct evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>because [a] conviction may be sustained on the basis of a single strand of direct evidence or successive links of circumstantial evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Montgomery v.

State, </em>329 Md. 1, 14, 616 A.2d 1275 (1992), the Court of Appeals applied well-settled rules of statutory interpretation in determining the meaning of the statute. Noting that the \u201c \u2018cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and effectuate legislative intent,\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>at 15, 616 A.2d 1275 (quoting <em>State v. Bricker, </em>321 Md. 86, 92, 581 A.2d 9 (1990)), the Court looked to the terms \u201corganizer,\u201d \u201csupervisor,\u201d \u201cfinancier,\u201d and \u201cmanager\u201d and determined that they are \u201ccommon words with well understood meanings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 11, 616 A.2d 1275. The Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>As these words are defined by Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (1981), an \u201corganizer\u201d is \u201cone who organizes\u201d (to \u201corganize\u201d is \u201cto unify into a coordinated functioning whole; ... to arrange by systematic planning and coordination of individual effort\u201d).

Accordingly, the Court looked to the \u201clarger context of the statute and to other relevant materials to ascertain legislative intent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 16, 616 A.2d 1275. <em>Accord Morse v. Erie Ins. Exch., </em>217 Md.App. 1, 34, 90 A.3d 512 (2014) (\u201cWhen the text is ambiguous, we must look beyond the statute\u2019s plain language to determine legislative intent.... \u2018The Court will look at the larger context, including the legislative purpose, within which statutory language appears.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Consol. Constr. Servs., Inc. v. Simpson, </em>372 Md. 434, 457, 813 A.2d 260 (2002)).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">After conducting this legislative review, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>It is plain to us that the phrase \u201cdrug kingpin\u201d was intended by the legislature to apply to a leader of a drug trafficking network. It thus follows that the words \u201corganizer,\u201d \u201csupervisor,\u201d \u201cfinancier,\u201d and \u201cmanager,\u201d read in the context of the statute, were not intended to encompass a person occupying a role substantially less than that of a large-scale drug trafficker. In other words, in looking to the larger context of the statute (which prescribes lesser penalties for non-kingpins); at the bill\u2019s title; and at external evidence in order to chart the blurry perimeters of the statute\u2019s operative terms, we believe that the legislature intended the statute\u2019s heightened penalties for \u201cdrug kingpins,\u201d or leaders, to have limited application to those acting as organizers, supervisors, financiers, or managers of large-scale drug trafficking operations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b239-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 17, 616 A.2d 1275.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">In <em>Williams, </em>the Court summarized Mr. Williams\u2019 limited role in the drug conspiracy as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-6\">(1)[ ]agreeing to and transporting the drugs ... to Salisbury; (2) negotiating the final purchase price of $34,000; (3) engaging a driver to transport him and the drugs to Salisbury; (4) receiving and counting the ... money; (5) secreting that money in his car; and (6) advising [the undercover officer] that he could be directly contacted for further sales.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A5Z\"><em>Id. </em>at 20, 616 A.2d 1275. Although the evidence indicated that Mr. Williams was \u201can important cog\u201d in effectuating a large drug transaction, and he was \u201cmore than a \u2018mule\u2019 or mere courier of the drugs,\u201d the Court held that the evidence did not permit a rational fact finder to conclude, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Mr. Williams\u2019 \u201cparticipation amounted to that of an organizer, a supervisor, or manager within the contemplation of the statute.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">In two cases decided by this Court, however, we held that there was sufficient evidence to allow the jury to determine that the respective defendants acted as drug kingpins. In <em>Allen v. State, </em>89 Md.App. 25, 52, 597 A.2d 489 (1991), <em>cert. denied, </em>325 Md. 396, 601 A.2d 129 (1992), this Court held that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>the evidence sufficiently demonstrated that Allen was more than just a co-conspirator; he was an organizer, manager, and supervisor, in addition to serving as a financier. The State \u201cpresented witnesses who testified that they participated in the narcotics operation under Peter Allen\u2019s supervision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 52, 597 A.2d 489. There was evidence that Mr. Allen paid his sister-in-law to transport money for him, that another witness used to sell drugs for him, and that Mr. Allen would supply that witness with drugs to sell. <em>Id. </em>at 52-53, 597 A.2d 489. We determined that the latter evidence, along with tapes played at trial of Mr. Allen organizing the times, locations, and prices of drugs to be sold, established that Mr. Allen \u201cwas a leader of a drug operation, rather than a mere player with no greater authority than the others.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 53, 597 A.2d 489. Accordingly, we held that \u201c[t]here was clearly sufficient evidence for the jury to find that Peter Allen was, indeed, a \u2018drug kingpin.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 53, 597 A.2d 489.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">Similarly, in <em>Velez v. State, </em>106 Md.App. 194, 203, 664 A.2d 387 (1995), we addressed whether there was sufficient evidence to find that Isabel Velez acted as a drug kingpin in a family drug operation. In that case, there was evidence that Ms. Velez \u201csupervised and orchestrated\u201d the family\u2019s drug transactions, including that she helped determine who owed the family money for drugs, directed others to collect money owed, gave approval before drug sales were made, made arrangements to purchase drugs from their supplier, and distributed drugs to lower-level players. <em>Id. </em>Under these circumstances, we determined that \u201ca rational fact-finder could have found that Velez\u2019s role was that of an organizer, supervisor, or manager of the drug operation, not just a low-level player with no more authority than the others.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">Based on these cases, it is clear that, to qualify as a drug kingpin, a defendant must be more than a \u201cmere player,\u201d <em>Allen, </em>89 Md.App. at 53, 597 A.2d 489, or an \u201cimportant cog\u201d in a trafficking scheme. <em>Williams, </em>329 Md. at 20, 616 A.2d 1275. Rather, there must be evidence that the accused acted as \u201ca leader of a drug trafficking network,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 16-17, 616 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>A.2d 1275, and he or she exercised a measure of control over the drug conspiracy. <em>Allen, </em>89 Md.App. at 51-52, 597 A.2d 489.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">With that background in mind, we address whether there was sufficient evidence to support appellant\u2019s drug kingpin conviction. Appellant argues that there was not sufficient evidence that he \u201corganized, supervised, financed or managed Antoine Savoy, Roosevelt Brooks, or Cranston Brown in a drug conspiracy.\u201d He asserts that there was no evidence establishing that he controlled their activities, as required by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">To be sure, unlike in <em>Allen </em>and <em>Velez, </em>there was no direct testimony in this case that appellant exerted control over Mr. Brooks, Mr. Savoy, or Mr. Brown. Rather, the State\u2019s case was based on circumstantial evidence that appellant was the leader of a drug conspiracy. A conviction, however, may be based on circumstantial evidence. <em>See Johnson v. State, </em>154 Md.App. 286, 305 n. 6, 839 A.2d 769 (2003) (\u201cCircumstantial evidence is entirely sufficient to support a conviction, provided the circumstances support rational inferences from which the trier of fact could be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused.\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>380 Md. 618, 846 A.2d 402 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">Here, the circumstantial evidence was sufficient to support the jury\u2019s verdict that appellant acted as a drug <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>kingpin, i.e., leader of the drug operation. Sergeant McDonough, an expert in drug distribution organizations, testified that appellant was a mid-to-high level drug dealer. He based his opinion on the large quantities of drugs, as well as materials used to package cocaine and crack cocaine for sale, and materials used to convert cocaine to cocaine base, or crack, found in appellant\u2019s photo shop. Moreover, the packages of cocaine found in the photo shop included: (1) packages that were packed to be sold for $150 to $200; and (2) larger, quarter kilo amounts, indicating a dealer who had staff to give the quarter kilos to sell. Appellant also had on his person several independence cards belonging to other people, a common method of payment for drug users, and he had been seen driving several rental cars during the surveillance period, consistent with the practice of drug traffickers. Thus, there was evidence for the jury to find that appellant was a high level drug dealer.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">The evidence also showed that appellant\u2019s drug operation included Mr. Brooks and Mr. Savoy, and that appellant was the leader of the operation. There was evidence that appellant visited the barbershop that Mr. Savoy co-leased with appellant, and Mr. Brooks frequented, approximately 20 times in the three month surveillance period. Appellant was seen entering and leaving the shop with a bag, and after he left, the CDS activity would increase.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Mr. Savoy and Mr. Brooks sold drugs to an undercover agent. A copy of the search warrant for appellant\u2019s house was found during a search of Mr. Brooks\u2019 house.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">In addition, almost $100,000 in cash was found inside a bag in appellant\u2019s storage unit, which was leased in his name. That bag, which matched the description of the bag that appellant was seen carrying when entering and exiting the barbershop, also contained what an expert determined was a ledger to track funds coming in and out. During the execution of the warrant for appellant\u2019s home, detectives found a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>money counter. Thus, in addition to being in possession of large quantities of CDS, and quantities of cocaine indicating a dealer who had staff to give large quantities of cocaine to sell, the evidence supported a finding that appellant was the person responsible for retaining large quantities of cash, as well as the means to count and track that cash. This evidence supports the jury\u2019s finding that appellant was a leader of a large drug operation, and that he managed the operation.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Accordingly, the evidence was sufficient to support the drug kingpin conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">Sentence</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">Appellant\u2019s final contention involves his sentences for possession with intent to distribute more than 448 grams of cocaine (count 3), possession with intent to distribute more than 50 grams of cocaine base (count 4), possession of cocaine with intent to distribute (count 5), and possession of cocaine base with intent to distribute (count 6).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> He argues that the circuit court erred in sentencing him \u201cboth for being a volume dealer and for possession with intent to distribute,\u201d asserting that his sentences for possession \"with intent to distribute cocaine and cocaine base (counts 5 and 6) should merge into the sentences for volume dealing of more than 448 grams of cocaine and more than 50 grams of cocaine base (counts 3 and 4).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>Appellant argues that merger is appropriate pursuant to any of the following four theories: (1) the required evidence test; (2) because legislative intent requires merger; (3) the rule of lenity; and (4) principles of fundamental fairness.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Noting that this argument was not raised below, appellant asks us to invoke the plain error doctrine to review the merits of his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">Preservation</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">Because the merger argument was not raised below, appellant asks us to invoke the plain error doctrine to review the merits of his claim. As the Court of Appeals has explained, however, when a court imposes a sentence that \u201cis not authorized by law, the sentence is illegal,\u201d and an illegal sentence claim \u201c \u2018is not subject to waiver.\u2019 \u201d <em>Waker v. State, </em>431 Md. 1, 7, 63 A.3d 575 (2013) (quoting <em>Johnson v. State, </em>427 Md. 356, 371, 47 A.3d 1002 (2012)). <em>Accord Fisher v. State, </em>367 Md. 218, 292-93, 786 A.2d 706 (2001) (\u201can illegal sentence can, and should, be addressed even if not preserved or properly raised\u201d). In <em>Britton v. State, </em>201 Md.App. 589, 598-99, 30 A.3d 236 (2011), Chief Judge Krauser, writing for this Court, explained that, \u201cwhen the trial court is required to merge convictions for sentencing purposes but, instead, imposes a separate sentence for each unmerged conviction,\u201d \u201cthe result is the imposition of a sentence \u2018not permitted by law.\u2019 \u201d (Quoting <em>Campbell v. State, </em>65 Md.App. 498, 510, 501 A.2d 111 (1985)). Thus, at least in a situation where merger is required under the required evidence test or the rule of lenity, the issue of merger is properly before us even in the absence of an objection below. <em>See Pair v. State, </em>202 Md.App. 617, 625, 649, 33 A.3d 1024 (2011) (Although the failure to merge multiple convictions pursuant to the required evidence test or the rule of lenity renders a sentence illegal, the failure to merge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>convictions pursuant to fundamental fairness is not inherently an \u201cillegal sentence.\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>425 Md. 397, 41 A.3d 571 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">Prior Statutory Scheme</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">Previously, this Court held that a conviction for possession with the intent to distribute merged into a conviction for possession of CDS in a designated amount. <em>See Simpson v. State, </em>121 Md.App. 263, 290, 708 A.2d 1126 (1998); <em>Anderson v. State, </em>89 Md.App. 712, 727, 599 A.2d 861 (1991). Those cases, however, addressed a different statutory scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">At the time the above cases were decided, Md.Code (1991 Supp.) Art. 27 \u00a7 286 provided as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-9\">(a) Except as authorized by this subheading, it is unlawful for any person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-10\">(1) To manufacture, distribute, or dispense, or to possess a controlled dangerous substance in sufficient quantity to reasonably indicate under all circumstances an intent to manufacture, distribute, or dispense, a controlled dangerous substance....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-11\">(f)(1) <em>If a person violates subsection (a)(1) of this section and the violation involves </em>any of the following controlled dangerous substances, in <em>the amounts indicated, </em>the person is subject to the penalties provided in paragraph (3) of this subsection upon conviction:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-12\">(ii) 448 grams or more of cocaine or 448 grams or more of any mixture containing a detectable amount of cocaine;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-13\">(iii) 50 grams or more of cocaine base, commonly known as \u201ccrack.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b245-14\">(Emphasis added). This statute, by its terms, provided that the elements of an offense charged under \u00a7 286(a) and \u00a7 286(f) contained the same elements, with the exception that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>\u00a7 286(f) contained a quantity requirement. <em>Anderson, </em>89 Md.App. at 726, 599 A.2d 861. Section 286 involved one offense, with an enhanced penalty when the violation involved listed CDS in certain amounts. <em>Wadlow v. State, </em>335 Md. 122, 125, 131-32, 642 A.2d 213 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">In 2005, however, the General Assembly revised CL \u00a7 5-612 and other sentencing enhancing provisions in response to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), which, as the legislature explained, held that \u201ca sentencing judge\u2019s imposition of an enhanced penalty, based on facts that were not admitted by the defendant or found by a jury, violated the defendant\u2019s right to a trial by jury.\u201d S.B. 429, Fiscal and Policy Note (Feb. 15, 2005). To avoid running afoul of <em>Blakely, </em>the Committee to Revise Article 27 recommended \u201crepealing the factual penalty enhancement in the penalty provisions and to place the factual circumstance that leads to the increased penalty into the factual elements of the underlying offense <em>to be charged as its own, separate, new offense.\u201d Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">Accordingly, the legislature revised CL \u00a7 5-612, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-6\">(a) A person who violates \u00a7 5-602 of this subtitle-with respect to any of the following controlled--dangerous -substances in the- amounts indieated is subjeet-on conviction to a--fine not exceeding $-100,000 and the enhanced penalty provided in subsection (c)-of-this section- may not manufacture, distribute, dispense, or possess:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-7\">(2) 448 grams or more of cocaine;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-8\">(4) 50 grams or more of cocaine base, commonly known as \u201ccrack\u201d;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-9\">(c)(1) A person who is convicted under-\u00a7 5-602 of-this subtitle with respect to a controlled dangerous substance in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>an amount indicated in of a violation of subsection (a) of this section shall be sentenced to imprisonment for not less than 5 years and is subject to a fine not exceeding $100,000.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Av1\">2005 Md.

State, </em>375 Md. 678, 691, 827 A.2d 68 (2003)). Separate sentences are prohibited when \u201c \u2018a defendant is convicted of two offenses based on the same act or acts and one offense is a lesser-included offense of the other.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sifrit, </em>383 Md. at 137, 857 A.2d 88 (quoting <em>Khalifa v.

State, </em>195 Md.App. 408, 440, 6 A.3d 396 (2010) (quoting <em>McGrath v.

Lancaster, </em>332 Md. 385, 391, 631 A.2d 453 (1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">Here, appellant asserts that all of the elements of possession with intent to distribute cocaine are also present in the offense of possession with intent to distribute more than 448 grams of cocaine, and that all of the elements of possession with intent to distribute cocaine base are also present in the offense of possession with intent to distribute more than 50 grams of cocaine base, and therefore, merger of the latter offenses is required. The State contends that \u201c[t]his argument is plainly wrong.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">CL \u00a7 5-602, entitled \u201cManufacturing, distributing, possession with intent to distribute, or dispensing controlled dangerous substance,\u201d provides, in pertinent part, that a person may not \u201cpossess a controlled dangerous substance in sufficient quantity reasonably to indicate under all circumstances an intent to distribute or dispense a controlled dangerous substance.\u201d Pursuant to the statute, the elements of possession with intent to distribute cocaine or cocaine base include: (1) possession of CDS; and (2) circumstances indicating an intent to distribute the CDS.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-9\">CL \u00a7 5-612, entitled \u201cVolume Dealer,\u201d provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AM\">\n<em>Unlawful Amounts.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-10\">(a) A person may not manufacture, distribute, dispense, or possess:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>(2) 448 grams or more of cocaine;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-5\">(4) 50 grams or more of cocaine base, commonly known as \u201ccrack.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">Pursuant to CL \u00a7 5-612, the elements of a volume dealer charge include: (1) manufacturing, distributing, dispensing or possessing CDS; and (2) in the requisite quantity.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">Each of these offenses contains an element that the other does not. CL \u00a7 5-602 requires an intent to distribute, which is not required by CL \u00a7 5-612. And CL \u00a7 5-612 requires a minimum quantity of drugs, which is not required by CL \u00a7 5-602. Accordingly, the offenses do not merge under the required evidence test. <em>See Lancaster, </em>332 Md. at 391, 631 A.2d 453 (\u201c[I]f each offense contains an element which the other does not, there is no merger under the required evidence test[,] even though both offenses are based upon the same act or acts.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-9\">Rule of Lenity</p>\n<p id=\"b249-10\">Appellant next argues that, even if his sentences do not merge under the required evidence test, merger is still required. In that regard, he asserts that \u201cit is clear that the Maryland legislature did not intend to authorize multiple punishments based on a single act of possession of a controlled dangerous substance,\u201d or, at the very least, the legislative intent is unclear. The State disagrees, arguing that \u201c[n]othing in the plain language of the statutes nor their legislative history indicates that separate punishments cannot be imposed for these separate crimes, to the contrary, it indicates that the circuit court\u2019s imposition of sentences here was entirely proper.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>Even if offenses do not merge under the required evidence test, merger may still be required under the rule of lenity. <em>Moore v. State, </em>198 Md.App. 655, 686, 18 A.3d 981 (2011). \u201cThe \u2018rule of lenity\u2019 is a principle of statutory construction\u201d that \u201camounts to an alternate basis for merger in cases where the required evidence test is not satisfied, and is applied to resolve ambiguity as to whether the Legislature intended multiple punishments for the same act or transaction.\u201d <em>Marlin v. State, </em>192 Md.App. 134, 167, 993 A.2d 1141 (2010). We have explained the rule of lenity as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-5\">\u201cTwo crimes created by legislative enactment may not be punished separately if the legislature intended the offenses to be punished by one sentence. It is when we are uncertain whether the legislature intended one or more than one sentence that we make use of an aid to statutory interpretation known as the \u2018rule of lenity.\u2019 Under that rule, if we are unsure of the legislative intent in punishing offenses as a single merged crime or as distinct offenses, we, in effect, give the defendant the benefit of the doubt and hold that the crimes do merge.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b250-6\"><em>Moore, </em>198 Md.App. at 686, 18 A.3d 981 (quoting <em>Clark v. State, </em>188 Md.App. 185, 207-08, 981 A.2d 710 (2009)). <em>Accord Quansah v. State, </em>207 Md.App. 636, 653, 53 A.3d 492 (2012), <em>cert. denied, </em>430 Md. 13, 59 A.3d 507 (2013) (where two sentences \u201cdo not merge under the required evidence test because each offense requires proof of distinct elements, nevertheless merger may be necessary if the Legislature did not intend to authorize multiple punishments based on a single act or there is uncertainty as to whether the Legislature intended to do so,\u201d and applying the rule of lenity); <em>Pair v. State, </em>202 Md.App. 617, 638, 33 A.3d 1024 (2011) (\u201cIf the Legislature intended two crimes arising out of a single act to be punished separately, we defer to that legislated choice ... If the legislature intended but a single punishment, we defer to that legislated choice. If we are uncertain as to what the Legislature intended, we turn to the ... \u2018Rule of Lenity\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Walker v. State, </em>53 Md.App. 171, 201, 452 A.2d 1234 (1982)).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>As explained, <em>infra, </em>the legislative history establishes that, when Article 27 \u00a7 286(f) was enacted, possession of a certain quantity of drugs was not intended to result in a sentence additional to that for possession with the intent to distribute. Rather, it was intended to \u201cdistinguish the volume drug dealer from the street corner dealer by establishing a mandatory minimum penalty of 5 years in jail for the possession of certain threshold quantities of a controlled dangerous substance.\u201d <em>State v. Wheeler, </em>118 Md.App. 142, 148, 701 A.2d 1221 (1997). Although the General Assembly subsequently changed CL \u00a7 5-612 to make it a separate offense from \u00a7 5-602, it did so to avoid a constitutional issue. There is no language in the amended statute, as there is in CL \u00a7 5-613, the drug kingpin statute, providing that a conviction under \u00a7 5-612 does not merge with other crimes. And CL \u00a7 5-612 continues to refer to the penalty as an \u201c[e]nhanced penalty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">Given these circumstances, it appears that the General Assembly did not intend that volume dealing be punished separately from the offense of possession with intent to distribute. At the very least, the intent is ambiguous. In that circumstance, we resolve that ambiguity in appellant\u2019s favor. <em>See Quansah, </em>207 Md.App. at 656, 53 A.3d 492 (\u201cWhen \u2018we are uncertain as to what the Legislature intended, we turn to the ... \u201cRule of Lenity\u201d by which we give the defendant the benefit of the doubt.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Walker, </em>53 Md.App. at 201, 452 A.2d 1234); <em>Handy v. State, </em>175 Md.App. 538, 577, 930 A.2d 1111 (2007) (\u201c \u2018doubt or ambiguity as to whether the legislature intended that there be multiple punishments for the same act or transaction \u201c \u2018will be resolved against turning a single transaction into multiple offenses\u2019 \u201d \u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">In applying the rule of lenity, however, the lesser penalty merges into the greater penalty. <em>See Spitzinger v. State, </em>340 Md. 114, 125, 665 A.2d 685 (1995) (\u201cwhere there is a merger of penalties as distinguished from offenses, on some ground, such as the rule of lenity, the lesser penalty generally merges into the greater penalty\u201d). Here, as indicated, appellant received 25 years for the conviction of possession with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>intent to distribute cocaine, 20 years, consecutive, for the conviction of possession with intent to distribute cocaine base, and 5 years, concurrent, for each of the volume dealer convictions. Accordingly, for sentencing purposes, appellant\u2019s convictions for volume dealing merge into his convictions for possession with intent to distribute.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">SENTENCES IMPOSED PURSUANT TO CL \u00a7 5-612 VACATED.

Mr. Brown was incarcerated at the time of trial. Prior to his arrest in 2008, he had been residing with appellant. He was in jail for his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>conviction for possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, based on cocaine that was found inside a safe in his closet at appellant\u2019s home. Mr. Brown ultimately pled guilty to the charge, although he initially told police investigators that the safe was there when he moved into appellant\u2019s residence. Certified records from the Division of Corrections indicated that appellant visited Mr. Brown in jail, and appellant deposited substantial funds into Mr. Brown's commissary account.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b230-12\">. Bank records from PNC Bank were for appellant, doing business as \u201cB &amp; K Multi Services,\u201d and bank records from M &amp; T Bank contained transactions by appellant, as well as Kyler Inc. The State sought to introduce the records to rebut testimony implying that the large amounts of cash found in appellant\u2019s possession could be explained as proceeds from his photography business. In closing, the State argued as follows: \u2018'You'll see in [appellant\u2019s] bank records....the amounts of deposits he makes and all of the expenditures he has.\u201d The State asserted that, relative to the large amounts of money found in his storage unit and suitcase, \"it does not add up.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b234-9\">.

Other courts similarly have defined these terms. <em>See U.S. v.

We note that, in other state and federal drug kingpin statutes, there is a requirement that the defendant supervise a certain number of co-conspirators. <em>See State v. Afanador, </em>134 N.J. 162, 631 A.2d 946, 952 (1993) (to convict a defendant as being a drug kingpin under the New Jersey statute there must be evidence that \"the drug-trafficking conspiracy involvefs] at least three persons: the kingpin defendant and two others\u201d); 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 848(c) (2014) (a defendant must \u201cact in concert with five or more other persons with respect to whom such person occupies a position of organizer, a supervisory position, or any other position of management\u201d). There is no such requirement in Maryland. <em>See Williams </em>v. <em>State, </em>329 Md. 1, 13, 616 A.2d 1275 (1992) (\"By stiffening the penalties for those who act in the management ranks of drug conspiracies, without regard to the number ... of coconspirators, the Maryland statute simply constructs a wider net\u201d than other kingpin legislation.).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b242-7\">. The police also found a lease agreement for the barbershop in the photo shop.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b243-8\">. Although Cranston Brown was incarcerated at the time of the central drug conspiracy at issue here, there was evidence that appellant was his \"employer\u201d and placed funds in his commissary account after he pled guilty to possession of drugs found in appellant\u2019s home. This evidence also permitted the jury to infer that appellant acted in a supervisory capacity with respect to Mr. Brown.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b243-9\">. The court sentenced appellant as follows: (1) 25 years for the possession with intent to distribute cocaine conviction; (2) 20 years, consecutive, for the possession with intent to distribute cocaine base conviction; and (3) 5 years, concurrent, for each of the convictions under the volume dealer statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b244-8\">.
