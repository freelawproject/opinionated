After a hearing (the \u201cTPR Hearing\u201d), the court grounded its finding of exceptional circumstances in: (1) Mother\u2019s refusal to allow physicians to administer medication to K\u2019Amora after she was born exposed to human immunodeficiency virus (\u201cHIV\u201d); (2) nearly two years of comprehensive but unsuccessful efforts by the Baltimore City Department of Social Services (\u201cDSS\u201d) to involve Mother in K\u2019Amora\u2019s life and assess Mother\u2019s ability to parent her; (3) Mother\u2019s historical inability to provide a safe environment for her other children; and (4) K\u2019Amora\u2019s positive and healthy experience with her foster family. Mother challenges the termination decision and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">K\u2019Amora was born on February 16, 2012 and, as the testimony at the TPR Hearing revealed, needed help immediately. As social worker Catherine Miller testified, right after K\u2019Amora\u2019s birth Mother\u2014who was HIV-positive and had a \u201chigh HTV viral load\u201d at the time\u2014refused HIV medication for herself and for K\u2019Amora, even though doctors advised her that K\u2019Amora\u2019s risk of contracting HIV from <em>in \u00fatero </em>exposure would fall \u201calmost down to zero\u201d with treatment. To compound the problem, Mother expressed irrational and inconsistent reasons for refusing treatment:<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-6\">[Sjometimes she would tell us that she didn\u2019t want to take the medications because she needed to take them on a full stomach.... And then the next time the medications were due, she would say that she couldn\u2019t take them because she needed to take them on an empty stomach. And the conversations would just go around and around, with no successful outcome.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b312-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>Mother acted erratically in the hospital in other ways. She called the police to the hospital at least three times, claiming that the staff were \u201ctrying to kidnap her baby, and lying about her.\u201d Because of concerns about K\u2019Amora\u2019s safety, hospital staff placed a \u201csitter\u201d (a \u201cprofessional who sits in the room to ensure ... the baby\u2019s safety\u201d) in Mother\u2019s hospital room. Ms. Miller summed up Mother\u2019s disposition by describing her as \u201cargumentative, irrational and difficult to work with,\u201d and hospital staff ultimately called DSS for an Emergency Family Involvement Meeting (\u201cFIM\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">Tricia Fayall, a child protective service worker at DSS, received Ms. Miller\u2019s report and oversaw the FIM at the hospital, the result of which was that \u201cbecause of [Mother\u2019s] mental state, ... we thought that it would be best for [K\u2019Amora] to go into foster care.\u201d It would be an understatement to say that the FIM did not go smoothly: \u201c[Mother] called the police on us, while we were there. And then she called the police on the police, while we were there.\u201d Mother evidently believed that Ms. Fayall (or hospital staff, it\u2019s not clear which) were \u201ctrying to take her baby ... right then and there,\u201d but called the police a second time because she felt that the responding officers were not \u201cdoing their job.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">Six days after K\u2019Amora was born, DSS placed her in the care of a foster family,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and Mother had weekly supervised visitation opportunities. Priscilla Iwuanyanwu, the assigned case worker beginning in March 2012, oversaw K\u2019Amora\u2019s placement and visits with Mother; she knew Mother because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>she had also overseen the care of Mother\u2019s three other children, whom we discuss below. Unfortunately, Mother\u2019s erratic behavior continued. Of her sixty-one scheduled visits with K\u2019Amora, she missed twenty-seven. She changed her phone number frequently and never kept DSS abreast of her whereabouts. And although Mother signed two service agreements with DSS, she refused to sign the third, which would have run from February 26, 2013 to August 29, 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">The visits Mother did attend failed to blossom into a healthy parent-child relationship. When K\u2019Amora cried at visits, and she often did, Mother became angry, frustrated, and confused. Mother expressed reluctance to take K\u2019Amora out of her car seat and was known to leave a visit early if K\u2019Amora did not settle down quickly. As K\u2019Amora advanced from infancy to toddlerhood, Ms. Iwuanyanwu saw no bond form between them, and expressed concern that Mother took pictures of K\u2019Amora rather than interacting with her. At one point, Mother even seemed to deny being K\u2019Amora\u2019s mother:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-5\">Most of the time she comes to visit, she\u2019s kind of quiet. She don\u2019t say nothing. If I try to tell her to try to interact with her child, <em>she would tell me, well, it\u2019s your child. That\u2019s not my child. I\u2019m just here to visit.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">(Emphasis added.) Mother\u2019s behavior at visits ranged from quiet to volatile; at one point she accused Ms. Iwuanyanwu of hitting K\u2019Amora, and on another occasion suggested that K\u2019Amora\u2019s foster mother had been breast-feeding her (even though she had no reason to think this was the case). Ms. Iwuanyanwu expressed frustration that Mother seemed to make no effort to bond with her daughter, and DSS remained uncomfortable with the prospect of K\u2019Amora living with her.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">Sharmika Spence, a Team Administrator with DSS, covered for Ms. Iwuanyanwu and supervised two of Mother\u2019s visits with K\u2019Amora. In January 2013, Mother complained at a visit that K\u2019Amora was upset and crying because her hair had been styled too tightly (even though Ms. Spence didn\u2019t believe that was the case). Ms. Spence recalled that Mother \u201cseemed to not know what to do\u201d in response to K\u2019Amora\u2019s crying. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>Although K\u2019Amora ultimately settled down, Ms. Spence expressed the belief that she did so because she \u201cwore herself out,\u201d not because Mother succeeded in comforting her. Ms. Spence saw \u201cno observation of a real bond of how a child would respond when they are familiar with someone and can be consoled.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">Ms. Spence supervised another visit in which Mother not only couldn\u2019t connect with K\u2019Amora, but blamed her crying on her foster parents\u2019 neglecting to feed her\u2014even though Ms. Spence observed that K\u2019Amora was of an appropriate height and weight, and DSS never had any concerns about her health or the quality of her foster family\u2019s care. Mother ended that particular visit early, and Ms. Spence observed that Mother again seemed unable to handle K\u2019Amora\u2019s fussiness. Ms. Spence also related an episode in which Mother called her into a visit and complained about a bruise on K\u2019Amora\u2019s thigh that the social worker explained came from an immunization. Mother insisted that the bruise resulted from abuse at the hands of K\u2019Amora\u2019s foster parents, and she contacted police. The police then required that a physician investigate, and Child Protective Services ruled out the possibility of any abuse (consistent with K\u2019Amora\u2019s medical records, which showed a recent immunization).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">Overall, Ms. Spence questioned Mother\u2019s \u201cability to parent K\u2019Amora safely\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-6\">I have concern about her, about the bond with the child. During visits there are times when I have been called in to a visit because [Mother] will not talk to the child, will not touch the child. And that\u2019s a concern for [DSS].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-7\">Because if you\u2019re displaying that kind of behavior or actions in a ... place where you know you\u2019re being monitored, then when you\u2019re at home Pm not sure that you\u2019re going to be displaying some loving care and affection for this child, if they are not reacting to you in a way in which you think they should.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-8\">And [Mother] has shown that she cannot ... reconcile two thoughts. So when I say that K\u2019Amora doesn\u2019t respond to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>her in a way that maybe a child who\u2019s been with their mother all along would respond. And I try to explain to [Mother] that this is why we have to continue to have visits, so that she becomes familiar with you, and things like that. She\u2019s ... it seems that she can\u2019t bring the two together. And she becomes upset with the child because she doesn\u2019t respond to her.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-4\">Mother also expressed to Ms. Spence the belief that DSS was \u201cplaying mind games with her, that the worker is jealous of her. And that\u2019s why she doesn\u2019t want to give her child back. Because the worker wants the child.\u201d Ms. Spence testified that Mother\u2019s mental health issues were the greatest impediment to reunification. Mother told Ms. Spence that she went to therapy only to mollify DSS, and Ms. Spence was concerned that Mother would not seek any mental health treatment at all if she got K\u2019Amora back. In their several FIMs, Ms. Spence found Mother combative, resistant to therapy or to addressing her mental health issues, and completely unwilling to consider taking medication.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">Indeed, Mother\u2019s mental health was a recurring theme throughout the TPR Hearing. Mother\u2019s therapist, Deborah Wells Lane, testified that Mother would not accept medications to treat her diagnosed \u201cmajor depression disorder.\u201d Mother\u2019s attendance at counseling sessions was \u201cinconsistent,\u201d and as of the date of the TPR Hearing, Mother had not appeared for a session for over five months. Because of her sporadic attendance, Ms. Lane described her improvement as \u201cslight.... [I]t was really still in the beginning stages.\u201d (Her treatment goals included developing coping skills, learning to manage the symptoms of her depression, and getting into a daily routine.) Much like Ms. Spence, Ms. Lane believed that Mother only attended treatment in order to try to get K\u2019Amora back. And Ms. Iwuanyanwu testified that although Mother agreed in services agreements to provide documentation of her mental health visits, she never did so, and when Ms. Iwuanyanwu confronted Mother, she would claim that her therapist was lying about her failure to appear.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>Mother\u2019s history with her other children, especially with her oldest daughter (\u201cSister\u201d),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> revealed prior incidents of neglect and abuse that several of the witnesses at the TPR Hearing corroborated. The juvenile court declared Sister a CINA in July 2011, when she was thirteen years old, after it found that Mother had beaten Sister with an extension cord, and Sister reported that Mother had punched and slapped her. But Sister repeatedly fled foster homes and returned to Mother, leading DSS to let her remain with Mother in spite of the abuse. (Although this seems counterintuitive, DSS thought it best for Sister to live with Mother because her case worker would know where she was and because, unlike K\u2019Amora, Sister was old enough to report any further abuse or neglect.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>) Mother\u2019s two other children were in the care of their respective fathers and, therefore, not formally declared CINA, but Ms. Iwuanyanwu had been their DSS case worker as well, and the record contained evidence that raised serious questions about Mother\u2019s ability to provide a safe environment for any of her children.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">Mother, on the other hand, viewed DSS\u2019s lesser-of-two-evils decision to allow Sister to remain with her as acknowledging her ability to care for K\u2019Amora:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-5\">[Mother] would say, I know how to care for my own child. If you think I\u2019m not good enough for K\u2019Amora, why did you send [Sister] home? There was so many time she had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>threaten that she bringing [Sister] back to us. She said [Sister] doesn\u2019t listen, she\u2019s stubborn, she don\u2019t go to school.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">Ms. Spence differentiated K\u2019Amora\u2019s situation from Sister\u2019s primarily by their age difference:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-5\">At K\u2019Amora\u2019s age it\u2019s important that she understands that there\u2019s going to be an adult present to meet her need, at the point she notifies us that there is a need to be met. And because she talks very little, her way to let someone know that she has a need is to cry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-6\">And if an adult around her is not able to console her, it internally creates something in the child that she\u2019s not going to be, her needs are not going to be met. And so, of course, that can produce things later on in life.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-7\">And so our concern is [Mother\u2019s] ability to meet her needs, to console her. To find out what is wrong with her, and to be able to address it at the time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">Both Ms. Spence and Ms. Iwuanyanwu recommended that the court terminate Mother\u2019s parental rights. Ms. Spence agreed with counsel for DSS that Mother was \u201cin control of the barriers to reunification,\u201d and that she had failed to take \u201cany steps to remove those barriers,\u201d despite DSS\u2019s efforts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AQ\">We have worked with [Mother] for some time towards reunification, without progress.... I have personally pleaded my case with her, with regard to just addressing the things that she needs to address, so that she can have her child back in her care, as she said she would like. And <em>it just has not moved forward.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-9\">I have grave concerns about her mental health and her ability to maintain K\u2019Amora\u2019s safety and well being. And <em>I don\u2019t think that </em>at this time, or at any time in the near future, if [Mother] does not address her mental health, that <em>she will be able to maintain K\u2019Amora\u2019s well being.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-10\">Ms. Iwuanyanwu likewise opined that the court should terminate Mother\u2019s parental rights because Mother was not following through with her service agreement, her court-ordered mental health treatment, or visits with K\u2019Amora. She <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>also stated that K\u2019Amora viewed her foster parents as her parents, and that she felt safe and well-cared for with them.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">K\u2019Amora\u2019s foster mother, Betty R. (\u201cMs. R.\u201d), then testified about the care she provided to K\u2019Amora right after her birth and about K\u2019Amora\u2019s life in the R. Family\u2019s home. K\u2019Amora had received all of her medications and was HIV-free at the time of the TPR Hearing. Ms. R. and her husband have two adult children (a son, forty-one, and a daughter, thirty-eight), two adopted children (a son in college and a daughter who was five years old at the time of the hearing), and also are foster parents to a boy about K\u2019Amora\u2019s age. Ms. R. described K\u2019Amora as a \u201cvery loving,\u201d and \u201cvery friendly, very happy\u201d child. As she put it, her foster son and K\u2019Amora were like siblings and played very well together. K\u2019Amora also had good relationships with Ms. R.\u2019s other children and grandchildren. Ms. R. described K\u2019Amora\u2019s involvement with church activities and considered her very much a part of the R. Family.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">Mother also testified at the TPR Hearing, after suggesting initially that she would not. Mother claimed that she had attended all of her visits with K\u2019Amora, cancelling \u201cmaybe like two times,\u201d and only because she had to go to therapy. She denied ever being told she needed medication for mental health issues. She contended that she went to therapy even though she was not depressed, and she denied ever telling Ms. Iwuanyanwu that she wanted to change therapists because hers was not telling the truth.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">Mother also professed the belief that DSS workers and the R. Family were harming K\u2019Amora. She recalled finding a lump on K\u2019Amora\u2019s thigh during a visit, and on another occasion saw \u201cpinch marks\u201d on her leg, but did not report these to anyone because \u201c[t]hey all know what they doing to the child.\u201d She claimed Ms. Iwuanyanwu would not permit her to take pictures of K\u2019Amora to document the latter incident. When asked about K\u2019Amora\u2019s crying during visits, Mother suggested that K\u2019Amora wanted to stay with her and would not have reason to cry if she were in Mother\u2019s care:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>I mean if she cries, well she\u2019s 2 now. If she cries it\u2019s because she could be hungry or just sleepy or just tired. It could be anything.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-4\">The hospitals\u2014usually when my children cry a lot, it could be that they might be hungry or need to be changed. But she\u2019s not a baby, she\u2019s a toddler now. So it\u2019s different from a baby.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-5\">When a baby cry, like [Sister\u2019s] son, when he cries and cries and cries, I know that he\u2019s teething. So it could be multiple things for a child to cry. But if it\u2019s a sever\u2014severe cry I know that she probably just want to go\u2014if I had her\u2014if the Judge order for her to come back I probably'\u2014She probably\u2014But she know who I am so it wouldn\u2019t be no reason and she\u2019s not in school.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-6\">It\u2019s not like she don\u2019t know who I am and not want to stay with me. She knows I\u2019m her momma.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">In response to questions from the court, Mother denied refusing to give K\u2019Amora medication at the hospital, denied that she had refused to pick up K\u2019Amora at visits, and denied ever having seen a bruise on any of her children like the bruise on K\u2019Amora that she reported to police after a shot at a physician\u2019s office.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">After closing arguments, the judge ruled from the bench and, in a decision that covered more than fourteen transcript pages, granted DSS\u2019s petition to terminate Mother\u2019s parental rights:</p>\n<p id=\"b319-9\"><em>First, </em>the court found that Mother had been \u201cuncooperative\u201d in the hospital after K\u2019Amora\u2019s birth, that she had refused medication for herself and for K\u2019Amora, and that her behavior overall was \u201cstrange.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b319-10\"><em>Second, </em>the court addressed the quantity and quality of her visits with K\u2019Amora and found that she missed 27, or 45%. The court characterized Mother\u2019s behavior overall as \u201cinconsistent\u201d: \u201cThe operative word that comes with regard to the efforts of [Mother] to reunify with [K\u2019Amora] is inconsistent. She\u2019s inconsistent with her total health care therapy. She\u2019s inconsistent with her visitation with [K\u2019Amora].\u201d The court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>also found that Mother repeatedly had not attended or completed other services that DSS offered her, such as parenting classes, and she had not kept DSS apprised of her whereabouts. And the court found that when Mother <em>did </em>attend visits, they were not positive experiences for her or for K\u2019Amora:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-4\">There would be combativeness between Mother and worker. There would be a lack of engagement between Mother and child. Workers would testify that at [one] point [Mother] was not even talking with the child and not even engaging with the child. Even when prompted to do so even by the workers who may have been present. Or her own mother who was present once or twice trying to mimic that which you do in order to console and engage with your own child.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AJ8\"><em>Third, </em>the judge expressed concern that Mother\u2019s history with her other children, especially Sister, demonstrated an inability to care adequately for the one (older) child who was in her care. And the court noted that DSS had provided services to Mother for K\u2019Amora\u2019s other brother and sister too, and that a CINA adjudication had only been avoided for them because their fathers had \u201cstepped in and taken [Mother\u2019s] place.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\"><em>Finally, </em>the court contrasted K\u2019Amora\u2019s foster family, where the older children \u201cappear to be on paths of success,\u201d and where K\u2019Amora had adjusted and was learning from her foster-sister. As the court put it, \u201c[f]rankly, all of this child\u2019s ties are to her foster family.\u201d The court found that terminating Mother\u2019s parental rights \u201cwould free [K\u2019Amora] to be reared and raised in what ... [t]his Court considers to be, a stable home with children who are similarly situated. With experienced parents who have provided stability in the past for children who are similarly situated.\u201d Although the court conceded that the issue of K\u2019Amora\u2019s medications had since been corrected, it still viewed as potentially harmful a decision <em>not </em>to terminate Mother\u2019s parental rights, explaining that \u201c[t]o uproot this child now would probably traumatize this child. <em>And she has never been in her mother\u2019s care.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>In light of these facts, the court found that \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d justified terminating Mother\u2019s parental rights:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A0g\">Would it be an unacceptable risk to return this child to [Mother] who has shown inconsistencies and a lack of stability and, in some respects a lack of even caring for herself, much less a 21-month-old child. I think those inconsistencies and that lack of stability almost has a geological effect on this case. Because when it comes to issues of termination of parental rights we\u2019re talking about pressure over a period of time. And this period of time, <em>from the date that the child was bom to today\u2019s date, and the efforts of the mother to prepare herself to have her child back, the efforts failed.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-5\"><em>So the Court finds that there are exceptional circumstances </em>in this case that will preclude this Court from returning [K\u2019Amora] to [Mother], This young child K\u2019Amora is doing well. This young child K\u2019Amora only knows Mr. and Mrs. R. as her mother and father. And only knows her extended family as her family.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-6\">So the Court finds that it would be rather unacceptable and <em>an unacceptable risk and detrimental to the best interest of the child to continue this parental relationship.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-7\">Whether [Mother] is an unfit parent or not by clear and convincing evidence, that\u2019s a little bit more difficult for the Court. Because housing has been provided.[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>] She is taking care of\u2014There is a child that resides in her home. And she is taking care of a young grandchild.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-8\"><em>But the Court is satisfied as to the other circumstances with regard to K\u2019Amora that would make it unacceptable to continue this parental relationship. </em>The inconsistences, it\u2019s everyone else\u2019s fault.

DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">The trial court remarked at the beginning of its ruling that \u201c[i]t\u2019s almost as if the termination process began once [K\u2019Amora] came out of the womb,\u201d and it is fair to say that Mother\u2019s refusal to allow K\u2019Amora to receive antiviral medication started them down a path that culminated in the TPR Hearing and decision at issue. But that is not to say that the outcome was preordained. In addition to that first (and ill-considered) medical decision, the court relied on a nearly two-year (for K\u2019Amora, life-long) pattern of erratic behavior, missed visits, and troubling mother-daughter interactions <em>and </em>on the positive environment in which K\u2019Amora had lived her entire life with her foster family to support its findings, by clear and convincing evidence, that \u201cthe other circumstances ... would make it unacceptable to continue this parental relationship\u201d and that \u201cit is in K\u2019Amora\u2019s best interest to grant the Department\u2019s petition.\u201d The court opted <em>not </em>to analyze Mother\u2019s fitness to serve as K\u2019Amora\u2019s parent, a question the court viewed as a closer one, but relied solely on the \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d prong of Md.Code (1984, 2006 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 5-323(b) of the Family Law Article (\u201cFL\u201d). In that way, then, this case is the analytical mirror image of our recent decision in <em>In re Jasmine D., </em>217 Md.App. 718, 94 A.3d 837 (2014), an unfitness case in which we recognized that the plain language of FL \u00a7 5-323(b) authorizes a termination of parental rights <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>to be premised on a finding <em>either </em>of unfitness or \u201cexceptional circumstances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">Mother contends broadly on appeal that \u201cthe trial court err[ed] by terminating [her] parental rights.\u201d We examine that question against a three-tiered, interrelated standard of review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-5\"><em>\u201c[First, </em>w]hen the appellate court scrutinizes factual findings, the clearly erroneous standard ... applies. <em>[Second, </em>i]f it appears that the [juvenile court] erred as to matters of law, further proceedings in the trial court will ordinarily be required unless the error is determined to be harmless. <em>Finally, </em>when the appellate court views the ultimate conclusion of the [juvenile court] founded upon sound legal principles and based upon factual findings that are not clearly erroneous, the [juvenile court\u2019s] decision should be disturbed only if there has been a clear abuse of discretion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-6\"><em>In re Yve S., </em>373 Md. 551, 586, 819 A.2d 1030 (2003) (quoting <em>Davis v.

We review the circuit court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and its ultimate decision to terminate Mother\u2019s parental rights for abuse of discretion. <em>See id.; see also In re Shirley B., </em>419 Md. 1, 19, 18 A.3d 40 (2011) (holding that to warrant reversal, the trial court\u2019s decision must \u201cbe well removed from any center mark imagined by the reviewing court and beyond the fringe of what that court deems minimally acceptable\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">A. The Statutory Framework For TPR Proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">When considering a petition to terminate parental rights, courts must balance the presumption that \u201ca continuation of the parental relationship is in the child\u2019s best interests,\u201d <em>In re Jayden G., </em>433 Md. 50, 53, 70 A.3d 276 (2013), \u201cagainst the fundamental right and responsibility of the State to protect children, who cannot protect themselves, from abuse and neglect.\u201d <em>In re Rashawn H., </em>402 Md. 477, 497, 937 A.2d 177 (2007). Accordingly, the Family Law Article authorizes courts to terminate parental rights without consent only under specific, narrow circumstances:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number><em>If, </em>after consideration of factors as required in this section, <em>a juvenile court finds by clear and convincing evidence </em>that a parent is unfit to remain in a parental relationship with the child <em>or that exceptional circumstances exist that would make a continuation of the parental relationship detrimental to the best interests of the child </em>such that terminating the rights of the parent is in a child\u2019s best interests, the juvenile court may grant guardianship of the child without consent otherwise required under this subtitle and over the child\u2019s objection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">FL \u00a7 5\u2014323(b) (emphasis added). A parent\u2019s right to raise her children \u201cis not absolute,\u201d <em>In re Darjal C., </em>191 Md.App. 505, 530, 992 A.2d 503 (2010), but the \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d standard imposes a greater burden than the \u201cmere preponderance\u201d standard we use in custody determinations. <em>Rashawn H., </em>402 Md. at 499, 937 A.2d 177; <em>compare Karen P. v. Christopher J.B., </em>163 Md.App. 250, 266-67, 878 A.2d 646 (2005) (undertaking \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d analysis in the context of a custody dispute). And this makes good sense, since a TPR determination is not merely a change in status, but represents the legal and total end to the parent\u2019s relationship with the child. <em>See Rashawn H., </em>402 Md. at 496, 937 A.2d 177 (termination of a parent\u2019s rights results in \u201ca total rescission of the legal relationship between parent and child\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">Beyond recognizing the presumption, though, a <em>parent\u2019s </em>rights do not drive our decision. As the Court of Appeals recently reaffirmed, <em>\u201cthe child\u2019s best interest </em>has always been the transcendent standard in ... TPR proceedings,\u201d <em>In re Ta\u2019Niya C., </em>417 Md. 90, 112, 8 A.3d 745 (2010) (emphasis added), and \u201ctrumps all other considerations,\u201d even the rights and interests of parents. <em>Id. </em>at 111, 8 A.3d 745.

There, the Court of Appeals reversed a termination order, holding that a father\u2019s failure to improve his circumstances over a long period of time could not, standing alone, justify termination based on exceptional circumstances. Although there were factors that favored termination,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the trial court had before it no expert testimony regarding the \u201cchildren\u2019s feelings and emotional ties\u201d with their father, nor did it \u201carticulate any finding that a continued parental relationship with [the father] would prove <em>detrimental </em>to their best interests.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 460, 987 A.2d 536 (emphasis added). In short, the Court of Appeals held that the trial court had erred by basing its decision almost solely on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>father\u2019s absence from his children\u2019s lives over time, even though the father had a fulltime job and a home that could accommodate the children: \u201cPassage of time, without explicit findings that the continued relationship with [the father] would prove detrimental to the best interests of the children, is not sufficient to constitute exceptional circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 463, 987 A.2d 536 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">The Court of Appeals has also directed trial courts to consider a parent\u2019s \u201cbehavior or character\u201d in the exceptional circumstances analysis. <em>See In re Adoption/Guardianship No. A91-71A, </em>334 Md. 538, 563, 640 A.2d 1085 (1994) (examining \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d in the context of a father\u2019s challenge to the adoption of his child by a third party and the attendant termination of his parental rights). The Court suggested in that case that exceptional circumstances <em>can </em>exist where a parent\u2019s behavior might not rise to the level of unfitness, but nonetheless contributes to a broader picture that could justify termination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-5\"><em>Behavior that may not be extreme enough to warrant a finding of unfitness is still relevant </em>to the ultimate finding of whether it is in the child\u2019s best interest to grant an adoption over the objection of the parent. Therefore, in making the best interest determination, <em>this evidence can, and should, be considered not only with regard to fitness, but as a potential factor which may give rise to exceptional circumstances </em>warranting the termination of parental rights.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b328-6\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">More recently, the Court of Appeals has emphasized the importance of stability and permanency for the child in the TPR analysis. In <em>In re Jayden G., </em>433 Md. 50, 70 A.3d 276 (2013), the trial court found <em>both </em>unfitness and exceptional circumstances and those factual findings went unchallenged on appeal. After noting that \u201c[a] critical factor in determining what is in the best interest of a child is the desire for permanency in the child\u2019s life,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 82, 70 A.3d 276 the Court explained the difficult limbo a foster child inhabits:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>The status of a foster child, particularly <em>for </em>the foster child, is a strange one. He\u2019s part of no-man\u2019s land.... The child knows instinctively that there is nothing permanent about the setup, and he is, so to speak, on loan to the family he is residing with. If it doesn\u2019t work out, he can be swooped up and put in another home. It\u2019s pretty hard to ask a child or foster parent to make a large emotional commitment under these conditions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b329-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 83-84, 70 A.3d 276 (quoting Joseph Goldstein, <em>Finding the Least Detrimental Alternative: The Problem for the Law of Child Placement, in </em>Parents of Children in Placement: Perspectives and Programs 188 n.9 (Paula A. Sinanoglu &amp; Anthony N. Maluccio eds., 1981)); <em>see also </em>Joseph Goldstein, Anna Freud <em>&amp; </em>Albert J. Solnit, <em>Beyond the Best Interests of the Child </em>43 (New Edition with Epilogue, 1979) (\u201cTherefore, to avoid irreparable psychological injury, placement, whenever in dispute, must be treated as the emergency it is for the child.\u201d); <em>id. </em>at n.* (\u201cThree months may not be a long time for an adult decisionmaker. For a young child it may be forever.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">Moreover, a parent\u2019s <em>actions </em>and <em>failures to act </em>both can bear on the presence of exceptional circumstances and the question of whether continuing the parent-child relationship serves the child\u2019s best interests. In <em>Jayden G., </em>the trial court terminated parental rights after finding the mother to be unfit <em>and </em>finding exceptional circumstances. The mother claimed that the court had focused improperly on the positive care that Jayden had received from his foster family rather than her continued involvement in Jayden\u2019s life. <em>Id. </em>at 101, 70 A.3d 276. The Court of Appeals noted that Jayden\u2019s mother had failed to make <em>any </em>positive progress over the two-plus years that Jayden lived in foster care which, coupled with Jayden\u2019s healthy adjustment to living with a foster family, led the Court to conclude \u201cthat a severance of the relationship with the [m]other <em>would not have a detrimental effect on Jayden, but ... would allow him to achieve permanency.\u201d Id. </em>at 102, 70 A.3d 276 (emphasis added); <em>see also Jasmine D., </em>217 Md. at 737, 94 A.3d 849. The facts in both <em>Jayden G. </em>and <em>Jasmine </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number><em>D., </em>although they differ in the specific details, bear a striking structural resemblance to the circumstances before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">C. The Trial Court Properly Found Exceptional Circumstances That Justified Terminating Mother\u2019s Parental Rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">This case presented an unusual fact pattern, at least among cases in which the court ultimately terminated the parent\u2019s rights. On the one hand, many of the family pathologies common to TPR cases were absent here. There was no allegation, for example, that Mother had affirmatively abused K\u2019Amora, nor any real opportunity for Mother to neglect her directly (she had gone straight from the hospital at birth to her foster home), nor any suggestion of substance abuse, nor an unstable housing situation. On the other hand, Mother had almost <em>no </em>actual involvement in K\u2019Amora\u2019s life, had failed in troubling and well-documented (and undisputed) ways to parent her other three children safely, all of whom had been removed from her care (and although DSS later returned Sister to Mother\u2019s case, it did so reluctantly and only under highly unconventional circumstances that press the outer boundaries of the \u201cleast detrimental alternative\u201d concept<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>). Mother had missed nearly half of her visits with K\u2019Amora, and, in the view of the judge who experienced her testimony first-hand, seemed floridly in denial about the state of her mental health and her responsibility to follow through with visits, parenting classes, and therapy. (As the trial judge saw it, Mother believed that \u201c[t]he inconsistencies [were] everyone else\u2019s fault.\u201d) So unlike <em>Alonza D., </em>this is not a case in which the termination decision was grounded entirely in the passage of time as the child lived with a stable foster family.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>The circuit court expressed some doubt about whether the evidence supported a finding by clear and convincing evidence that Mother is an unfit parent. But as in <em>Jay den G., &amp; failure </em>to parent can do as much damage as bad parenting. 433 Md. at 103, 70 A.3d 276 (noting that \u201ccontinuing to hold on to this concept of a parental relationship any longer\u2014in the face of the Mother\u2019s persistent inability to take charge of her life\u2014 was contrary to Jayden\u2019s best interest\u201d). And the court grounded its findings that exceptional circumstances were present and that K\u2019Amora\u2019s best interests were served by terminating her parental relationship with Mother in a lifelong series of failures and refusals on Mother\u2019s part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-4\">\u2022 Mother\u2019s refusal to allow K\u2019Amora to receive antiviral medication at birth;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-5\">\u2022 Mother\u2019s irrational and unfounded suspicions that hospital staff were attempting to kidnap K\u2019Amora;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-6\">\u2022 Mother\u2019s repeated denial of any mental health problems, in spite of professionals\u2019 advice that she undergo treatment and take medication, her refusal to participate meaningfully in counseling, and her concomitant failure to abide by service agreements with DSS;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-7\">\u2022 Mother\u2019s sporadic and unproductive visitation with K\u2019Amora, which averaged less than two hours a month, by our count, for the first twenty months of K\u2019Amora\u2019s life, and with the result that she failed to establish a bond at all with K\u2019Amora over that time;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-8\">\u2022 Social workers\u2019 specific concern that Mother could <em>not </em>\u201cmaintain K\u2019Amora\u2019s well-being\u201d if she were returned to Mother;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-9\">\u2022 Mother\u2019s failure to work for six years; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-10\">\u2022 Mother\u2019s history of failing to parent or provide safe environments for K\u2019Amora\u2019s older siblings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b331-11\">Mother argues that the circumstances here are not extraordinary, but rather \u201cquite ordinary,\u201d and that the court overreacted to Mother\u2019s hospital behavior and resistance to mental health care. She argues as well that Sister\u2019s return to Moth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>er\u2019s home undercuts the court\u2019s decision to terminate her parental rights: \u201c[M]other had a prior child protective services history involving [Sister], who was so bonded to her that she routinely ran from foster care and returned home, leading [DSS] to eventually conclude that she would be safer at home than constantly running.\u201d Mother acknowledges, though, that Sister (fifteen years old at the time of the TPR Hearing) is not in school, and now has a child of her own. And Mother is not the only one for whom counseling has been recommended; although a judge told <em>Sister </em>she should go to counseling, Mother disagreed that she needed it, and did not encourage her to go, because \u201cshe\u2019s not mental.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">We hold that the circuit court neither overreacted nor abused its discretion in terminating Mother\u2019s parental rights. The court faced the reality that sending K\u2019Amora to live with \u2019 Mother would have uprooted her from the safe and stable (and only) family environment she had known. The exceptional circumstances alternative is meant to cover situations, such as this, in which a child\u2019s transcendent best interests are not served by continuing a relationship with a parent who might not be clearly and convincingly unfit.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> And the court performed precisely the sort of child-specific analysis that FL \u00a7 5-323(b) requires. Some of the stereotypical markers of unfitness may be absent from K\u2019Amora\u2019s young life, but we see no abuse of discretion in the circuit court\u2019s decision not to send her to begin a life with a parent who refused her critical medical care, who has not been able or willing to secure medical care for herself, who has not participated consistently or effectively in visitation or programs designed to help the family, and with whom K\u2019Amora has formed no emotional or psychological bonds\u2014especially in the face of K\u2019Amora\u2019s safe and positive experience with the foster family that has cared for her since she left the hospital on Day Six.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>Mother\u2019s current parental relationship with Sister and Sister\u2019s baby son neither obviated nor limited the court\u2019s obligation to consider K\u2019Amora\u2019s \u201cbest interests\u201d individually:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AG\"><em>A court may reach different conclusions under FL Section 5-323(d) regarding different children of the same parent. </em>Indeed, as the facts of this case demonstrate, a parent may, for example, have regular and frequent contact with one child, but not the other, and have varying degrees of success in completion of different service agreements with respect to each child. Also, depending on the age at which the children of one parent were placed in foster care, the length of time they spent in foster care, and the frequency of contact with the natural parent, <em>one child may have maintained or formed an attachment to the natural parent, while the other child has not.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b333-4\"><em>Ta\u2019Niya C., </em>417 Md. at 116, 8 A.3d 745 (emphasis added); <em>see also In re Priscilla B., </em>214 Md.App. 600, 626, 78 A.3d 500 (2013) (pointing out that the \u201ccourt need not wait for an injury to occur before finding neglect\u201d). And we disagree with Mother\u2019s suggestion that the circuit court favored the foster family simply to improve K\u2019Amora\u2019s economic circumstances. The court did not view K\u2019Amora\u2019s best interests to lie with the foster family because of economics, nor should it. <em>See In re Priscilla B., </em>214 Md.App. at 604, 78 A.3d 500 (\u201c[P]overty does not render parents unfit or children unsafe.\u201d). Instead, it contrasted Mother\u2019s lack of any parenting at all with a family who had, in the best sense of the term, fostered K\u2019Amora\u2019s growth into a happy, healthy, well-adjusted child. We echo the sentiment Judge Harrell expressed in <em>Alonza D.:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-5\"><em>A </em>child is entitled to whatever stability in a loving and supportive familial environment that society can muster when parents are unwilling to provide it. [Mother\u2019s] creation of the opportunity for such an environment to unfold as it has, allowing the vacuum to continue for eight years, but desiring to unsettle what has been established or leave its continuation in doubt, cannot be tolerated or allowed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A9\"><em>Alonza D., </em>412 Md. at 469-70, 987 A.2d 536 (Harrell, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY AFFIRMED. COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b311-7\">. Mother also refused to allow a home nurse to administer medication to K'Amora after discharge, and occasionally (but not consistently) expressed doubt that K'Amora had been exposed to HIV in the first place (which she indisputably had).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b312-6\">. The procedural history leading up to the TPR hearing followed the normal course and is not at issue here. K\u2019Amora entered foster care pursuant to an emergency shelter order, after which DSS filed a petition to have K\u2019Amora declared a \"Child in Need of Assistance\u201d (\"CINA\u201d) that the juvenile court granted on June 26, 2012. <em>See </em>Md.Code (1974, 2013 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 3\u2014801(f) of the Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Article (\"CJ\u201d). After originally entering a permanency plan aimed at reunification with Mother, a juvenile master recommended on April 17, 2013 that the plan change to adoption by a non-relative, and the juvenile court adopted that recommendation on July 22, 2013. As required, DSS filed a Petition to terminate Mother's parental rights on May 15, 2013, and the TPR Hearing took place on November 12, 2013.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b316-6\">. Both Mother and DSS abbreviated the eldest daughter's name because they feared that its uniqueness might reveal the family's identity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b316-7\">. Ms. Iwuanyanwu explained that Sister would \"go AWOL\u201d from foster care almost weekly, returning to Mother or to her grandmother. At one point Sister reported being raped after she had run away from a foster home, and DSS preferred knowing that she was with Mother, where she could call DSS for help, rather than in limbo and on the run.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b316-8\">. Some of the DSS reports admitted in this case covered the family as a whole. Among other things, these records revealed that K\u2019Amora\u2019s brother did not attend school for a time in 2010, when he was about nine or ten years old, and that another sister had received treatment for gonorrhea when she was seven or eight. (We have inferred the children\u2019s approximate ages from the briefs.).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b321-9\">. There was no issue about the adequacy of Mother's housing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b321-10\">. The court also later found that DSS had made reasonable efforts to provide services of which Mother failed to take advantage, noting again <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>that \"the operative word in this case has been inconsistency on the part of the mother.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b327-6\">. In <em>In re Cross H., </em>200 Md.App. 142, 24 A.3d 747 (2011), <em>cert. dismissed, </em>431 Md. 371, 65 A.3d 679 (2013), we affirmed the trial court\u2019s finding that the <em>father </em>was unfit and that exceptional circumstances existed to justify termination of the <em>mother\u2019s </em>parental rights. Although the mother had a similar (lack of) relationship with the child there, we did not articulate what aspects of her history justified a finding of exceptional circumstances, as opposed to lack of fitness, or look at other cases examining extraordinary circumstances in the TPR context. <em>Id. </em>at 157-58, 24 A.3d 747; <em>compare, e.g., Karen P., </em>163 Md.App. at 267, 878 A.2d 646 (analyzing \"exceptional circumstances\u201d in a contested custody proceeding between a biological mother and a non-biological father).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b327-7\">. The children's father failed to complete parenting classes or abate lead in his residence despite a court order, the children were happy with a foster family who had cared for the children for the majority of their lives, and about four years had elapsed from the time Alonza and his brother were placed in foster care. <em>Aloma D., </em>412 Md. at 444, 987 A.2d 536.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b330-6\">. <em>See </em>Goldstein, Freud &amp; Solnit, <em>Beyond the Best Interests of the Child, </em>at 53 (\"The least detrimental alternative, then, is that specific placement and procedure for placement which maximizes, in accord with the child\u2019s sense of time and on the basis of short-term predictions given the limitations of knowledge, his or her opportunity for being wanted and for maintaining on a continuous basis a relationship with at least one adult who is or will become his psychological parent.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b332-5\">.
