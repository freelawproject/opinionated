(\u201cGrady Management\u201d), appeals an order of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County granting summary judgment in favor of appellee, Jesse Epps (\u201cMr. Epps\u201d). It presents one question<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for our review which we rephrase as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b737-11\">Did the circuit court err in granting appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment? For the reasons that follow, we shall affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\">Mr. Epps is a tenant residing in the Snowdens Ridge Apartments at 2108 Harlequin Terrace in Silver Spring, Maryland, an apartment project that receives federal funds under the Section 8 New Construction Program<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to subsidize the rent for its tenants. Mr. Epps and Grady Management entered into a model lease for such subsidized programs, which provides that \u201c[a]fter the initial term ends, the Agreement will continue for successive terms of one Year each unless automatically terminated as permitted by paragraph 23 of this Agreement.\u201d The termination clause (Paragraph 23) states, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-5\">23. Termination of Tenancy</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-6\">b. Any termination of this Agreement by the Landlord must be carried out in accordance with HUD regulations, State and local law, and the terms of this Agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-7\">c. The Landlord may terminate this Agreement for the following reasons:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-8\">1. the Tenant\u2019s material noncompliance with the terms of this Agreement;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-9\">d. the Landlord may terminate this Agreement for other good cause, which includes, but is not limited to, the tenant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>refusal to accept change to this agreement. Terminations for \u201cother good cause\u201d may only be effective as of the end of any initial[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>] or successive term.[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">The term material noncompliance with the lease includes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9T\">(1) one or more substantial violations of the lease....[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">On November 3, 2010, Grady Management brought an action, under the breach of lease statute, Md.Code (1974, 2010 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 8-402.1 of the Real Property Article (\u201cR.P.\u201d),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> in the District Court. The case was transferred to the circuit court after Mr. Epps requested a jury trial. The action alleged that Mr. Epps, a member of \u201chis household!,] or guest [made] excessive noises\u201d and \u201cthreatened another resident.\u201d On July 29, 2011, a jury found that Mr. Epps had breached the lease, and that the breach was substantial, but that it did not warrant eviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">On January 31, 2012, Grady Management sent Mr. Epps a Notice to Vacate by April 1, 2012 based on \u201cother good cause and/ or material noncompliance with the covenants and conditions of [Mr. Epps\u2019s] lease agreement[.]\u201d More specifically, that Mr. Epps or a guest of his household</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-6\">made excessive noise and disturbed [his] neighbors. [Mr. Epps,] an occupant[,] or guest threatened another resident. These incidents occurred in September 2010 in or about or close to [Mr. Epps\u2019s] premises of 2103 Harlequin Terrace, Silver Spring, MD. There were also prior incidents of noise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>making which occurred in June, August, September and November 2006 as well as April and May 2007[<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>] in or about or close to [Mr. Epps\u2019s] premises of 2103 Harlequin Terrace Silver Spring, MD. All of the herein described incidents were described in answers to discovery in [the breach of lease case]. A Montgomery County Circuit Court jury on or about July 29, 2011 found that this conduct constituted a substantial breach of the lease in [that case.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">When Mr. Epps refused to vacate, Grady Management filed a Tenant Holding Over<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Complaint in the District Court on April 10, 2012. In his answer, he argued that the complaint was barred by <em>res judicata </em>and collateral estoppel because of the breach of lease case. Mr. Epps again demanded a jury trial, and the case was transferred to the circuit court. Both parties filed motions for summary judgment on September 10, 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">In its motion for summary judgment, Grady Management argued that the burden of proof for removing a holdover tenant is much less than that in a breach of lease case. Arguing that the jury in the breach of lease case found that the excessive noise and threat qualified as a substantial breach of Mr. Epps\u2019s lease, there was good cause to terminate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>lease at the end of the term, even if those acts did not warrant an eviction during the term of the lease. Relying on <em>Carter v. Maryland Management Co., </em>377 Md. 596, 835 A.2d 158 (2003), Grady Management argued that a tenant holding over action can be brought against a federally subsidized tenant when the tenancy has been terminated for good cause. Grady Management stated, \u201c[t]he <em>[Carter </em>] Court held that the tenant does not have an indefinite tenancy or a never-ending lease and that when the original term expires the tenancy may be terminated for good cause and the tenant evicted pursuant to the tenant holding over statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">In his motion for summary judgment, Mr. Epps asserted that, because it could only be terminated for good cause, his \u201clease does not terminate upon the passing of an expiration date like a lease with a definite term, or at the discretion of the landlord as in a lease with an \u2018at will\u2019 term,\u201d and, therefore, the tenant holding over statute does not apply. In his supporting memorandum, citing <em>Cottman v. Princess Anne Villas, </em>340 Md. 295, 298, 666 A.2d 1233 (1995), he argued that the \u201c \u2018good cause\u2019 requirement gives [him] \u2018a continuing right of possession to the unit for an <em>indefinite time period.\u2019 \u201d </em>(Emphasis in memorandum). He explained that a tenancy under the New Construction Program is different from the tenancy in <em>Carter, </em>which was based instead on the Federal Low-Income Housing Tax Credit Program (\u201cLIHTC\u201d) and the Section 8 Tenant-Based Assistance Rental Voucher Program (\u201cVoucher Program\u201d). The <em>Carter </em>Court, he contends, allowed the landlord to proceed with the tenant holding over action because the lease in that case expired under its own terms, did not have a good cause requirement for termination, and the landlord had provided the requisite notice. Here, however, there was not \u201cgood cause\u201d for the landlord not to renew the lease. Because the reasons stated for termination were the same reasons given in the breach of lease case, the doctrine of <em>res judicata </em>precluded termination.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b743-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>In its opposition to Mr. Epps\u2019s motion for summary judgment, Grady Management responded that Mr. Epps was \u201con a year long lease which renewed every year[,]\u201d and thus, he was \u201ca tenant for a definite term[.]\u201d Any continuing right of possession \u201c[did] not mean that his tenancy is indefinite.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">Grady Management agreed that <em>res judicata </em>applied, but that the doctrine required a ruling in its favor because the jury had found a substantial breach of the lease and that finding provided the good cause required not to renew Mr. Epps\u2019s lease. Grady Management further explained that it could not have brought a tenant holding over action when it filed the breach of lease case because Mr. Epps was \u201cstill in his yearly term\u201d and therefore was not holding over. But, when Mr. Epps\u2019s lease was terminated for good cause at the end of his yearly term, he became a hold over tenant, and subject to a tenant holding over action.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">The circuit court held a hearing on October 18, 2012, and granted Mr. Epps\u2019s motion for summary judgment, reasoning that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-7\">the jury\u2019s prior verdict, that although it\u2019s finding a material breach, finding that that breach did not justify eviction is tantamount to\u2014you can phrase it different ways, but to preventing that jury verdict from constituting a good-cause basis not to renew, because I think there is\u2014clearly, everybody agrees on automatic right to renew unless there\u2019s good cause not to, and in essence, the jury verdict was \u201cthere\u2019s not good cause to remove this person from the property,\u201d and refusing to terminate is the equivalent in the context, the federal renewing lease situation is equivalent to eviction, and I will say that, as well, I do believe that the tenant holding over statute does not apply when in the renewing lease situation, that the basis for the alleged good cause here today has been litigated through a breach-of-lease <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>action that was heard by the jury. And now, in essence, the landlord is unilaterally saying \u201cwell, we find good cause because the jury did,\u201d or \u201cif our belief is bolstered by the jury verdict,\u201d and therefore, we are going to say \u201cno, we\u2019re not terminating,\u201d and even though the automatic right to terminate is there....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-5\">... I do think that refusing to continue the lease or to renew the lease is equivalent to terminating the lease, and the jury did not find that termination of the lease was appropriate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">Grady Management filed a timely appeal to this Court.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AOr\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">\n<em>The Arguments Presented</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b744-8\">On appeal, Grady Management argues that the termination clause of Mr. Epps\u2019s lease conforms with 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 880.607 in regard to the grounds for termination, and that it was not precluded by 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 880.607<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> from using the Maryland <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>tenant holding over statute to remove Mr. Epps. Grady Management also argues that the holding in <em>Carter, </em>that the tenant holding over statute can be applied to a federally subsidized voucher program, should be \u201cexpanded to provide that landlords are not precluded from using the Maryland tenant holding over statute to remove any federally-subsidized tenant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">According to Grady Management, under \u201c24 C.F.R. \u00a7 880.607, \u2018when a termination notice is issued for other good cause ... the notice will be effective, and it will so state, at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>end of a term and in accordance with the termination provisions of the lease.\u2019 \u201d The initial term of Mr. Epps\u2019s lease began on May 1, 2010 and ended on April 30, 2011, and the lease provides that \u201c[a]fter the initial term ends, the [Lease] will continue for successive terms of one Year each unless [] terminated as permitted by paragraph 23 of th[e Lease].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">Grady Management argues that the breach of lease statute, R.P. \u00a7 8-402.1, applies when \u201c \u2018an unexpired lease for a stated term provides that the landlord may repossess the premises prior to the expiration of the stated term if the tenant breaches the lease.\u2019 \u201d On the other hand, the tenant holding over statute, R.P. \u00a7 8-402, \u201cis available when \u2018a tenant under any periodic tenancy, or at the expiration of a lease ... shall unlawfully hold over beyond the expiration of the lease or termination of the tenancy.\u2019 \u201d Therefore, both the tenant holding over and breach of lease statutes can apply to New Construction Program tenants, depending on whether the action is brought during or at the end of the term, because the tenant holding over \u201cstatute applies to a tenancy for \u2018any <em>definite </em>term or at will\u2019 and the breach of lease statute applies to \u2018an unexpired lease for a <em>stated </em>term.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added). Grady Management contends that a \u201cdefinite term\u201d and a \u201cstated term\u201d are \u201ceffectively synonymous[,]\u201d but \u201c[e]ven if the semantic distinction between \u2018stated\u2019 and \u2018definite\u2019 is meaningful, Mr. Epps\u2019s position that his lease \u201cdoes not expire and is indefinite\u201d would \u201cmake it impossible for a Maryland New Construction Landlord to enforce its statutory and contractual right to terminate a tenancy for \u201cother good cause.\u201d If that were the case, landlords would be required to \u201cperpetually tolerate a habitual lease violator unless the Landlord could prove that the tenant committed a substantial breach which warranted the tenant\u2019s eviction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">In response, and denying the applicability of <em>Carter, </em>Mr. Epps distinguishes between tenant-based voucher programs, where the financial subsidy follows the tenant and are meant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>to operate as much like the unassisted market as possible,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and project-based subsidy programs. He contends that \u201c[t]he Court\u2019s rationale [in <em>Carter </em>] turns entirely on the fact that the Voucher Program lease at issue in that case did not contain a \u2018good cause\u2019 requirement that prevented the lease from expiration,\u201d and the one-year tenancy had expired. He states that \u201c[a]lthough the LIHTC Program requirements imposed a restriction on the landlord from terminating the tenancy except for \u2018good cause,\u2019 that \u2018good cause\u2019 requirement was not part of the lease agreement and therefore did not affect the Court\u2019s finding that the lease had expired.\u201d Therefore, the Court allowed \u201cthe landlord to proceed with a Tenant Holding Over action on the basis that the lease had expired (per the Voucher program) but requirfed] the landlord to prove \u2018good cause\u2019 at the Tenant Holding Over hearing (per the LIHTC program).\u201d His lease, however, does not expire and the \u201cgood cause\u201d requirement is part of the lease, and, therefore, \u201cthe rationale in <em>Carter </em>is inapplicable and does not justify [Grady Management\u2019s] circumvention of Maryland\u2019s statutory scheme in bringing a Tenant Hold Over action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">He argues further that, because the New Construction Program provides subsidies to project owners, the subsidy remains with the owner and not the tenant. For that reason, project-based programs provide the tenant with an \u201cendless lease\u201d that can be terminated only for good cause and \u201cdoes not expire on the passing of an expiration date like a typical private residential lease[.]\u201d Therefore, the tenant holding over statute is inapplicable because it only applies after the expiration of a tenancy for \u201cany definite term or at will.\u201d He points out that his lease \u201cexplicitly states that it will \u2018continue for successive terms of one Year unless terminated in accor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>dance with the termination provision [of the lease.]\u2019 \u201d Citing <em>Cottman, </em>340 Md. at 298, 666 A.2d 1233, he contends that the \u201cgood cause\u201d requirement for termination of his lease gives him a continuing right of possession for an indefinite period, and that, the end of any initial or successive term is not \u201ca fixed date that automatically ends the tenancy.\u201d It merely determines \u201cwhen [a landlord] may rely on \u2018other good cause\u2019 as a basis for terminating the tenancy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">Mr. Epps further contends that actions under the tenant holding over statute \u201cwere never meant to adjudicate the fact intensive issue of whether a tenant breached the lease and whether that breach gives the landlord the right to terminate the tenancy.\u201d In support of this argument, he cites Maryland Rule 3-711, pointing out that in a tenant holding over action \u201cpretrial discovery is not available, and only basic facts, such as the giving of proper notice and the passing of the lease\u2019s expiration date, need to be established\u201d and that breach of lease actions are not subject to this rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">Mr. Epps renews on appeal his argument that this action is barred by <em>res judicata </em>and collateral estoppel. He explains that <em>res judicata </em>applies because the parties are the same, the claim in the current action is identical to the previous adjudication, and there was a final judgment on the merits. Applying the transaction test,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> he asserts that the claims involve the same transaction because the facts in both cases \u201care predicated on the same lease dated September 14, 2010, and arise from the exact same breach of that lease.\u201d He argues that in both cases, Grady Management claimed the right to terminate Mr. Epps\u2019s lease because of a particular breach or set of alleged facts, and that, citing <em>Whitaker v. Whitaker, </em>60 Md.App. 695, 702, 484 A.2d 314 (1984), \u201ccannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>escape the bar of res <em>judicata </em>by bringing a new claim when that claim differs merely in form but not substance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">In regard to collateral estoppel, he argues that \u201c[a]lthough the element \u2018warrants an eviction\u2019 is not technically a part of the Tenant Holding Over statutory language, that element is necessarily \u201cimplicit in the definition of \u2018good cause\u2019 in this Tenant Holding Over action[,]\u201d and that \u201cthe federal \u2018good cause\u2019 standard[<footnotemark>15</footnotemark>] for breach and Maryland\u2019s Breach of Lease (R.P. \u00a7 8-402.1) standard are functionally identical in enabling the fact finder to weigh all of the relevant factors in determining whether a breach warrants an eviction.\u201d According to Mr. Epps, the jury\u2019s finding that the breach did not warrant an eviction precludes his landlord \u201cfrom establishing \u2018good cause\u2019 to terminate his lease in the Tenant Holding Over action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">He also argues that, even if his lease was not indefinite, Grady Management did not properly issue a notice to vacate \u201cand filed its Tenant Holding Over action prematurely.\u201d According to Mr. Epps, the tenant holding over statute only applies when a landlord has properly given notice and the tenant refuses to vacate at the end of the term. Here, Mr. Epps\u2019s \u201cinitial nominal term ended on April 30, 2011, [and] the lease continued for \u2018successive term[s] of one Year\u2019 to April 30, 2012 per the automatic renewal provision.\u201d The Notice to Vacate, given on January 31, 2012, stated that the date to vacate was April 1, 2012 and the tenant holding over action was filed on April 10, 2012, which was prior to the end of the renewal term. According to Mr. Epps, \u201c[bjecause there is no genuine dispute that [Grady Management] failed to provide a proper notice to vacate and filed its Tenant Holding Over <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>action prematurely,\u201d there is no issue of material fact and summary judgment was appropriate for that reason. Not only was this argument not the basis for the court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, it was not raised or decided in the circuit court and we will not address it in this opinion. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 8-131 (\u201cthe appellate court will not decide any other issue unless it plainly appears by the record to have been raised in or decided by the trial court\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\">\n<em>Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">Summary judgment may be granted when \u201cthe motion and response show that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and that the party in whose favor judgment is entered is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Md. Rule 2-501(e). Whether a grant of summary judgment was proper is a question of law that we review <em>de novo. Rockwood Cas. Ins. Co. v. Uninsured Emp\u2019rs Fund, </em>385 Md. 99, 106, 867 A.2d 1026 (2005). In determining whether a trial court\u2019s ruling as to summary judgment was legally correct, appellate courts \u201cconstrue the facts properly before the court, and any reasonable inferences that may be drawn from them, in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.\u201d <em>Jurgensen v. New Phoenix Atl. Condo., </em>380 Md. 106, 114, 843 A.2d 865 (2004). \u201cWe may not, ordinarily, affirm a summary judgment on a basis not relied upon by the circuit court[.]\u201d <em>Carter v. Aramark Sports &amp; Entm\u2019t Servs. Inc., </em>153 Md.App. 210, 246 n. 9, 835 A.2d 262 (2003) (citing <em>Hemmings v. Pelham Wood Ltd. Liab. Ltd. P\u2019ship, </em>375 Md. 522, 534, 826 A.2d 443 (2003)).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">Because we believe the differences in the federal leasing programs and the leases involved in <em>Carter </em>and in this case are important, our analysis begins with a discussion of the Court of Appeals\u2019s decision in <em>Carter. </em>In that case, the landlord participated in the Federal Low Income Housing Tax Credit Program<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and the tenant received housing assistance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>under the Voucher Program. <em>Carter, </em>377 Md. at 598, 835 A.2d 158. At issue was whether the landlord could use the Maryland tenant holding over statute to evict the tenant. <em>Id. </em>Carter argued that under the Low Income Housing Tax Credit Program, a landlord could not terminate a tenancy without good cause, so she had a right to continued occupancy and her \u201cfixed-term lease\u201d was converted \u201cinto an indefinite one[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 608-609, 835 A.2d 158. The Court rejected her argument, reasoning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-4\">At one time, the law may have supported petitioner\u2019s view of an indefinite lease. Prior to the consolidation of the certificate and voucher programs in a new \u00a7 1437f(o) in 1998, the leasing provisions governing those programs were contained in \u00a7 1437f(d)(1)(B), which provided, in relevant part, that (1) the lease between owner and tenant had to be for at least one year \u201cand shall contain other terms and conditions specified by the Secretary,\u201d and (2) the owner could not \u201cterminate the tenancy except for serious or repeated violation of the terms and conditions of the lease, for violation of applicable Federal, State, or local law, or for other good cause.\u201d Section 1437f(d)(1)(B)(iii) through (v) listed certain conduct that would be cause for termination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-5\">In 1995, the Secretary adopted new regulations for the certificate and voucher programs. <em>See </em>60 FR 34660 (July 3, 1995) adopting new 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.309. Those regulations required the lease to be for an initial term of at least one year and to provide either \u201c[f]or automatic renewal for successive definite terms (e.g., month-to-month or year-to-year); or ... [f]or automatic indefinite extension of the lease term.\u201d \u00a7 982.309(b)(1) and (2). It provided that the term of the lease would terminate if the owner, the tenant, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>or the two together terminated the lease, but stated that, during the term of the lease, the owner could not terminate the lease except for good cause. \u00a7\u00a7 982.309(b)(3), 982.310(a). In proposing those regulations, the Department noted that they were intended merely to \u201cconfirm and clarify\u201d the existing principle that \u201cthe tenancy continues automatically after the end of the initial lease term\u201d and that \u201c[t]here is no need or requirement for the parties to execute a new lease or lease extension\u201d as \u201c[t]he automatic extension is provided for in the lease originally executed by the landlord and family.\u201d 58 FR 11292 (Feb. 24, 1993)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-5\">We intimated as much, although the issue was not directly before us, in <em>Carroll v.

The issue there was whether a \u00a7 8 tenant, who challenged a tenant-holding-over action, had sufficiently alleged a controversy involving more than $500 to entitle her to a jury trial. Noting the good cause requirement in the Federal regulations, we concluded that she \u201chas a right to remain in her townhouse indefinitely until the Commission can establish good cause for eviction\u201d and that that right of continued tenancy, coupled with the rent subsidy, caused the value of the controversy to exceed $500. <em>Id. </em>at 525 [510 A.2d 540].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-6\">The statutory and regulatory regime changed significantly in 1998, however, when Congress consolidated the certificate and voucher programs in a new \u00a7 1437f(o). In place of the lease requirements of \u00a7 1437f(d), the new programs became subject to \u00a7 1437(o)(7) which, after requiring a one-year initial lease (unless the public housing agency approves a shorter term), provides that the lease shall (1) be \u201cin a standard form used in the locality by the dwelling unit owner,\u201d (2) \u201ccontain terms and conditions that\u2014(I) are consistent with State and local law; and (II) apply generally to tenants in the property who are not assisted under this section,\u201d and (3) \u201cprovide that during the term of the lease, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>the owner shall not terminate the tenancy except for serious or repeated violation of the terms and conditions of the lease, for violation of applicable Federal, State, or local law, or for other good cause.\u201d (Emphasis added). <em>See </em>P.L. 105-276, 112 Stat. 2461, 2599.

Recognizing that a showing of good cause remained necessary not to renew such leases, the Carter Court explained that while the changes in the Voucher Program</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-7\">were certainly intended to allow landlords more flexibility and to bring some aspects of the voucher program more in line with both private residential leasing practices and with State landlord-tenant law, we do not believe that they were intended to subject voucher tenants to the arbitrary whims of landlords who are reaping a significant tax advantage from the program. If we were to conclude that the good cause requirement applies only to mid-term evictions and not to renewal decisions, the program would lose substantial stability, as tenants could be evicted for no reason at the end of a one-year lease or at any time thereafter on 60 days notice. That would hardly be consistent with the declared Congressional purpose of \u201caiding low-income families in obtaining a decent place to live and of promoting economically mixed housing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b753-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 613, 835 A.2d 158 (citing 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437f(a)). The Court concluded that although a participating landlord cannot evict a voucher program tenant without good cause, that neither the tax credit program nor the voucher program precluded the use of the tenant holding over statute to remove a tenant who is holding over after expiration of a lease term. See <em>id. </em>at 614, 835 A.2d 158. To succeed in such an action, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>landlord \u201cmust comply with terms and conditions [of R.P. \u00a7 8-402] and establish good cause for refusing to renew the tenancy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">Mr. Epps\u2019s lease states it \u201cwill continue for successive terms of one Year unless automatically terminated\u201d in accordance with paragraph 23 of the lease. It, therefore, provides for automatic renewal and is more consistent with the voucher program leases prior to the amendment in 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">To terminate a New Construction Program lease, the landlord must \u201cassure due process to the tenant\u201d which \u201crequires a hearing and proof of good cause for eviction after notice of the grounds upon which eviction is sought.\u201d <em>Green v. Copperstone Ltd. P\u2019ship, </em>28 Md.App. 498, 517, 346 A.2d 686 (1975).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The question is whether the landlord\u2019s burden to establish good cause to terminate or not renew the lease at the end of a term is essentially the same as the landlord\u2019s burden to terminate during the term of the lease. Stated slightly differently, and in the context of this case: Can a claimed breach of the lease that did not warrant an eviction during the term of the lease constitute \u201cother good cause\u201d to terminate the lease at the end of a successive renewal term?</p>\n<p id=\"b754-7\">The lease before us provides for termination by the landlord for \u201cmaterial noncompliance,\u201d including \u201cone or more substantial violations of the lease; repeated minor violations of the lease[;]\u201d and for \u201cother good cause,\u201d but termination of the lease for \u201cother good cause\u201d is only effective at the end of a renewal term. Grady Management contends that \u201clandlords are not held to the more stringent requirements established by Maryland\u2019s breach of lease statute\u201d when establishing good cause to terminate or to not renew a lease at the end of a term. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>Because Mr. Epps\u2019s lease continues for successive terms, his right to possession continues for an indefinite period, and thus, until termination for good cause, he is in possession under what at that point in time is an \u201cunexpired lease.\u201d <em>See Cottman, </em>340 Md. at 298, 666 A.2d 1233 (\u201c[A] tenant in a federally subsidized housing unit ... had a continuing right of possession to the unit for an indefinite period.\u201d) (citing <em>Carroll v. Hous. Opportunities Comm\u2019n, </em>306 Md. 515, 525, 510 A.2d 540 (1986)).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> It follows that a decision to terminate \u201cfor other good cause,\u201d effective at the end of the term, or not to renew at the end of a term is an eviction and when based only on lease violations of the quiet enjoyment nature as claimed in this case, it is essentially a breach of lease case that should be treated no differently than a midterm eviction. <em>See Swann v. Gastonia Hous. Auth., </em>675 F.2d 1342, 1347 (4th Cir.1982)<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> (\u201cthe imposition of the good cause requirement recast all end-of-term evictions as evictions for violating the terms and conditions of the lease\u201d). Therefore, good cause to terminate a project-based lease at the end of a lease term or successive term based on a claimed lease <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>violation, appropriately and reasonably, should be subjected to Maryland\u2019s breach of lease standard for eviction. That conclusion is consistent with both federal and state policy and with the provision in Mr. Epps\u2019s lease that, <em>\u201cany </em>termination of this Agreement by the Landlord must be carried out in accordance with HUD regulations, State and local law, and the terms of this Agreement.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> (Emphasis added). The requirement of R.P. \u00a7 8-402.1 that a claimed \u201cbreach\u201d must \u201cwarrant ] an eviction\u201d does not, in our view, impose on a landlord seeking to terminate a project-based subsidized lease a \u201cmore stringent\u201d demonstration of good cause than is necessary.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">In <em>Sager v. Housing Commission of Anne Arundel County, </em>957 F.Supp.2d 627 (D.Md.2013), the tenant had a lease with an \u201callocation\u201d clause indicating that any payment not designated as rent could be applied by the landlord to outstanding maintenance charges and/or late fees or legal fees. 957 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>F.Supp.2d at 629-30. The court noted that the federally subsidized tenant was entitled to remain in her unit \u201cso long as she pa[id] her rent and refrain[ed] from actions deemed, after a hearing, to be \u2018serious or repeated violation of the terms of conditions of the lease or ... other good cause.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 633 (quoting 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437d(l)(5)). The court further explained that although the failure to pay rent could subject a tenant to Maryland\u2019s summary ejectment proceedings under R.P. \u00a7 8-401, other lease violations, such as poor maintenance of the unit, \u201cmust be dealt with\u201d through \u201ca more fulsome proceeding\u201d under R.P. \u00a7 8-402.1. <em>Id. </em>at 630, 638 n. 8.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\"> Similar to an ejectment proceeding, a tenant holding over action is an expedited repossession action. It applies to a tenant who unlawfully holds over beyond the expiration of the lease term and therefore does not contemplate a landlord\u2019s need to show good cause to terminate. Moreover, in a project-based subsidized lease program, such as the New Construction Program, the lease term continues, rather than expires, precluding holdover status until a determination of good cause to terminate the lease has been established. <em>See Jeffries v. Georgia Residential Fin. Auth., </em>503 F.Supp. 610, 622 (N.D.Ga.1980) (until termination for good cause, \u201chold over status will not arise, and the landlord cannot gain an eviction order in state court\u201d). We note that, in <em>Carter, </em>the tenant holding over action was initially brought together with a breach of lease action. The eviction in the tenant holding over action was upheld because good cause to terminate had been demonstrated in the holding over action and the tenant was thus deemed to be a tenant holding over. <em>See Carter, </em>377 Md. at 602, 614, 835 A.2d 158. We do not see where the issue of whether the burden to show good cause to terminate at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>end of the term was a lesser burden than that necessary to show good cause during the term of the lease was raised and expressly addressed in <em>Carter. </em>It is our view that it is not a lesser burden. That said, we are not holding that a holding over action based on a breach of a lease in the nature of the kind before us in this case cannot be brought based on \u201cother good cause\u201d to terminate effective at the end of a term. But, if that is done, there has to be a finding in the holding over action that good cause warrants an eviction. On the other hand, it also would be appropriate (and, because of the pretrial discovery issue, perhaps better) to bring a breach of lease case together with a tenant holding over action. The R.P. \u00a7 8-402.1 case could be decided first and then, if the claimed breach warrants an eviction, the R.P. \u00a7 8-402 holding over action would follow. Moreover, if the termination is based on \u201cother good cause,\u201d as in this case, but termination is not effective until the end of the term, the right to terminate could be obtained earlier so that, at the end of the term, the tenant is in fact holding over.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">This brings us to whether the grant of summary judgment in favor of Mr. Epps was correct as a matter of law.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> <em>Res judicata </em>and collateral estoppel \u201care based upon the judicial policy that the losing litigant deserves no rematch after a defeat fairly suffered, in adversarial proceedings, on issues raised, or that should have been raised.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Dep\u2019t of Human Res. v.

Clearly, the first and third requirements of <em>res judicata </em>and the second, third, and fourth requirements for collateral estoppel have been met in the breach of lease case. There was a final judgment, the parties are the same, and Grady Management was given a fair opportunity to be heard during the trial for the breach of lease. The only question is whether the claim and issue presented and decided in that case are identical to the issue presented in this case. The answer to that question hinges on whether the standard for showing good cause to terminate, effective at the end of the term, is subject to the R.P. \u00a7 8-402.1 standard that the claimed breach warrants eviction. We have held that it is.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">When Grady Management sought to terminate Mr. Epps\u2019s lease in the breach of lease case, the jury found that his breach of the lease, even though substantial, did not warrant an eviction. Even to the extent that a tenant holding over claim and action under R.P. \u00a7 8-402 may differ from a claim and action under R.P. \u00a7 8-402.1, they are, in the context of this case, essentially based on the same claim. Not only was Mr. Epps not a holdover tenant when the tenant holding over action was initiated, he does not reach holdover status until good cause has been established under the R.P. \u00a7 8-402.1 standard. The breaches of the lease that the landlord now claims constitute good cause to terminate the lease at the end of the term are the same lease violations that were fairly litigated in the breach of lease case and found not to warrant an eviction. Therefore, the grant of summary judgment in Mr. Epps\u2019s favor did not constitute error.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY AFFIRMED.
