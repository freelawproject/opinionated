The CIA has submitted a petition for rehearing, requesting reconsideration of the rulings set forth in Parts III and IV of our opinion, 697 F.2d at 1105-12, 1112-14. We are persuaded by the agency\u2019s argument that it has not acted in \u201cbad faith\u201d in processing McGehee\u2019s request for documents. Accordingly, we hereby grant the petition for rehearing and vacate Part IV of the opinion. Finding no reason any longer to doubt the credibility of the agency\u2019s affidavits, we approve the District Court\u2019s determination that the CIA adequately demonstrated that exemptions 1 and 3 of the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 552(b)(1), (3) (1976), entitle it to withhold, in whole or in part, 44 documents responsive to McGehee\u2019s claim, and we affirm the court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to the agency insofar as it pertains to those documents. All other aspects of our original opinion are reaffirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
