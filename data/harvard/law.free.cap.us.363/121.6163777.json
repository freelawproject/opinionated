The Court heard the claims together, but treats them in two opinions. This opinion deals solely with Florida\u2019s claims. The result as to the other States is discussed in one opinion, <em>\u2022ante, </em>p. 1. All the claims arise and are decided under the Submerged Lands Act of 1953.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b169-12\">The Act granted to all coastal States the lands and resources under navigable waters extending three geographical miles seaward from their coastlines. In addi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>tion to the three miles, the five Gulf States were granted the submerged lands as far out as each State\u2019s boundary-line either \u201cas it existed at the time such State became a member of the Union,\u201d or as previously \u201capproved by Congress,\u201d even though that boundary extended further than three geographical miles seaward. But in no event was any State to have \u201cmore than three marine leagues into the Gulf of Mexico.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This suit was first brought against Louisiana by the United States, <em>United States </em>v. <em>Louisiana, 350 </em>U. S. 990, invoking our original jurisdiction under Art. 111, \u00a7 2, cl. 2, of the Constitution, to determine whether Louisiana\u2019s boundary when it became a member of the Union extended three leagues or more into the Gulf, as Louisiana claimed, so as to entitle it to the maximum three-league grant of the Submerged Lands Act. After argument on the Government\u2019s motion for judgment against Louisiana, we suggested that the interests of all the Gulf States under the Act were so related, \u201cthat the just, orderly, and effective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>determination\u201d of the issues required that all those States be before the Court. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>354 U. S. 515, 516. All are now defendants, each has claimed a three-league boundary and grant, which the United States denies, and the issues have been extensively briefed and argued by the parties. As stated, this opinion deals only with the United States-Florida controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">Florida contends that the record shows it to be entitled under the Act to a declaration of ownership of three marine leagues of submerged lands, because (1) its boundary extended three leagues or more seaward into the Gulf when it became a State, and (2) Congress approved such a three-league boundary for Florida after its admission into the Union and before passage of the Submerged Lands Act. Since we agree with Florida\u2019s latter contention, as to congressional approval, we find it unnecessary to decide the boundaries of Florida at the time it became a State.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">Florida claims that Congress approved its three-league boundary in 1868, by approving<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> a constitution submitted to Congress as required by a Reconstruction Act passed March 2, 1867. 14 Stat. 428. That constitution carefully described Florida\u2019s boundary on the Gulf of Mexico side as running from a point in the Gulf \u201cthree leagues from the mainland\u201d and \u201cthence northwestwardly three leagues from the land\u201d to the next point.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>United States concedes that from 1868 to the present day Florida has claimed by its constitutions a three-league boundary into the Gulf.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The United States also admits that Florida submitted this constitution to Congress in 1868, but denies that the Gulf boundary it defined was \u201capproved\u201d by Congress within the meaning of the Submerged Lands Act.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This is the decisive question as between Florida and the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">The 1868 Florida Constitution was written and adopted by Florida pursuant to the congressional Act of March 2, 1867<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> as supplemented by a second Act of March 23, 1867.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> These Reconstruction Acts purported \u201cto provide for the more efficient Government of the Rebel States,\u201d including Florida. The States involved were divided into military districts and subjected to strict military authority. Detailed provisions were made for registration of voters, election of delegates to constitutional conventions, the framing of constitutions \u201cin conformity with the provisions\u201d of these Reconstruction Acts, and submission of the constitutions to the people of those States for their ratification and approval \u2014 all under the supervision and control of commanding generals. Constitutions so adopted were then to be \u201csubmitted to Congress for examination and approval,\u201d after which approval by Congress and after ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment by each State, each should be \u201cdeclared entitled to representation in Congress.\u201d Florida\u2019s Constitution was writ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>ten, considered and voted upon in the State in accordance with these statutory directions and under the eye and control of an Army general. When submitted to Congress it was much debated, and thereafter on June 25, 1868, another Act was passed authorizing the admission of Florida and other Southern States \u201cto Representation in Congress.\u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> 15 Stat. 73. The preamble to this \u201cAdmission Act\u201d declared that these States had adopted their constitutions \u201cin pursuance of the provisions\u201d of the 1867 Acts, which Acts, as has been pointed out, required \u201cexamination and approval\u201d of the constitutions as a prerequisite to readmission of congressional representation. Thus by its own description, Congress not only approved Florida\u2019s Constitution which included three-league boundaries, but Congress in 1868 approved it within the meaning of the 1867 Acts. In turn, the approval the 1867 Acts required appears to be precisely the approval the 1953 Act contemplates.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">The Government argues, however, that these readmission enactments did not contemplate and Congress did not make a general scrutiny of all the provisions of the state constitutions, but only that the constitutions had been duly adopted and were republican in form. The Government makes many references to debates which indicated that some Senators and Congressmen were satisfied with such a limited examination of the constitutions.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Florida, on the other hand, points out many <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>other remarks which indicated a much closer examination of the state constitutions.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">It is beyond doubt that the proposed constitutions were printed, then read, discussed, and amended in the Congress. For instance, the very 1868 bill that admitted Florida\u2019s congressional representatives contained a proviso rejecting certain parts of the Georgia Constitution.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> That at least some Congressmen scrutinized the constitutions to see if amendments were necessary is persuasively shown by the remarks of Congressman Thaddeus Stevens, set out below.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Mr. Stevens was Chairman of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>all-important Joint Committee on Reconstruction, and, because of his leading role as architect of the reconstruction plan finally adopted and carried out by Congress, has appropriately been called \u201cthe Father of the Reconstruction.\u201d <footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">The voluminous references to the Reconstruction debates fail to show us precisely how closely the Southern States\u2019 Reconstruction Constitutions were examined. We cannot know, for sure, whether all or any of the Congressmen or Senators gave special attention to Florida\u2019s boundary description. We are sure, however, that this constitution was examined and approved as a whole, regardless of how thorough that examination may have been, and we think that the 1953 Submerged Lands Act requires no more than this. Moreover, the Hearings and the Reports on the Submerged Lands Act show, as the Government\u2019s brief concedes, that those who wrote into that measure a provision whereby a State was granted up to three leagues if such a boundary had been \u201cheretofore approved by Congress,\u201d had their minds specifically focused on Florida\u2019s claim based on submission of its 1868 Constitution to Congress. When Florida\u2019s claims were mentioned in the hearings it was generally assumed that Congress had previously \u201capproved\u201d its three-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>league boundaries.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The Senate Report on a prior bill, set forth as a part of the report on the 1953 Act, pointed out that \u201cIn 1868 Congress approved the Constitution of Florida, in which its boundaries were defined as extending 3 marine leagues seaward and a like distance into the Gulf of Mexico.\u201d S. Rep. No. 133, 83d Cong., 1st Sess. 64-65.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The language of the Submerged Lands Act was at least in part designed to give Florida an opportunity to prove its right to adjacent submerged lands so as to remedy what the Congress evidently felt had been an injustice to Florida. Upon proof that Florida\u2019s claims met the statutory standard \u2014 \u201cboundaries . . . heretofore approved by the Congress\u201d \u2014 the Act was intended to \u201cconfirm\u201d and \u201crestore\u201d the three-league ownership Florida had claimed as its own so long and which claim this Court had in effect rejected in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>339 U. S. 707; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>339 U. S. 699; and <em>United States </em>v. <em>California, </em>332 U. S. 19. As previously shown, Congress in 1868 did approve Florida\u2019s claim to a boundary three leagues from its shores. And, as we have held, the 1953 Act was within the power of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>Congress to enact. <em>Alabama </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>347 U. S. 272. See also <em>United States </em>v. <em>California, </em>332 U. S. 19, 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">We therefore deny the United States' motion for judgment. We hold that the Submerged Lands Act grants Florida a three-marine-league belt of land under the Gulf, seaward from its coastline, as described in Florida's 1868 Constitution. The cause is retained for such further proceedings as may be necessary more specifically to determine the coastline, fix the boundary and dispose of all other relevant matters. The parties may submit an appropriate form of decree giving effect to the conclusions reached in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">\n<em>It is so ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b177-7\">The Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Claric took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b177-8\">Mr. Justice Frankfurter, whom Mr. Justice Brennan, Mr. Justice Whittaker and Mr. Justice Stewart join, concurring.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark></judges>\n<p id=\"b177-9\">Considering the variety of views evoked by these cases, I deem it appropriate to add a few words to the two Court opinions which I have joined.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-10\">The one thing which I take to be incontestable is that Congress did not, by the Submerged Lands Act of 1953, make an outright grant to any of the Gulf States in excess of three miles. Congress only granted to each of these States the opportunity to establish at law that it possessed a boundary in excess of three miles, either by virtue of possession of such a boundary at the time of its admission to the Union or by virtue of congressional \u201capproval\u201d of such a boundary prior to the enactment of the Submerged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>Lands Act. A Gulf State that can successfully establish such a judicially ascertainable fact is entitled to a grant of the submerged lands beyond three miles to a distance of the lesser of three leagues or of the boundary so established. Congress, in the Submerged Lands Act itself, did not determine the existence of a boundary for any State beyond three miles, either explicitly or by implied approval of a claim presented to it in the course of the legislative process. Nor of course did Congress vest this Court with determination of a claim based on \u201cequity\u201d in the layman\u2019s loose sense of the term, for it could not. Congress may indulge in largess based on considerations of policy; Congress cannot ask this Court to exercise benevolence on its behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">There is no foundation in the Act of 1953 or its legislative history for the view that particularized, express approval of a State\u2019s boundary claim by a prior Congress is required to make a defined boundary the measure of the grant. To the contrary, in the case of Florida, authoritative legislative history makes it perfectly clear that the very question deliberately preserved by the Act of 1953 was whether congressional approval of the new Florida Constitution in the Reconstruction legislation of 1867-1868, by which Florida was restored to full participation in the Union, amounted to an approval of the three-league boundary which that constitution explicitly set forth.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>I sustain Florida's claim because I find that its boundary was so approved.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">The proper construction of the effect of congressional \u201capproval\u201d of the Florida Reconstruction constitution presents problems quite different from those stirred by the constitutional controversy and its resulting problems that are compendiously known as Reconstruction. See Lincoln's last public address, April 11, 1865. 8 Basler, The Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln, 399. The readjustment of the relationship between the States that had remained in the Union and those that had seceded presented major issues not only for the political branches of the Government, the President and the Congress, but also for this Court. Insofar as the perplexing and recalcitrant problems of Reconstruction involved legal solutions, the evolution of constitutional doctrine was an indispensable element in the process of healing the wounds of the sanguinary conflict. It was in aid of that process that this Court formulated the doctrine expressed in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>famous sentence in <em>Texas </em>v. <em>White: </em>\u201cThe Constitution, in all its provisions, looks to an indestructible Union, composed of indestructible States.\u201d 7 Wall. 700, 725.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">This theory served as a fruitful means for dealing with the problems for which it was devised. It is unrelated to the question now before us, namely, whether, when it \u201capproved\u201d as an entirety the Florida Constitution as a condition to the recognition of that State\u2019s full membership in the Union, Congress exercised its undoubted power to approve the seaward boundary claim contained within it. It is in essence the contention of the United States that approval could only have been manifested explicitly, that Congress must have ratified the boundary provision in so many words, either expressly in the Reconstruction Acts, or by an authoritative gloss upon them in a committee report or a speech on the floor by a responsible chairman. But in these matters we are dealing with great acts of State, not with fine writing in an insurance policy. Florida was directed to submit a new constitution for congressional approval as a prerequisite for the exercise of her full rights in the Union of States and the resumption of her responsibilities. In this context it would attribute deceptive subtlety to the Congresses of 1867-1868 to hold that it is necessary to find a formal, explicit statement by them, whether in statutory text or history, that the boundary claim, as submitted in Florida\u2019s new constitution, was duly considered and sanctioned, in order to find \u201capproval\u201d of that claim.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b169-13\"> 67 Stat. 29, 43 U.

As shown in the Court\u2019s opinion relating to the other States involved in the litigation <em>(ante, </em>pp. 16-36), a state seaward boundary satisfy<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>ing the requirements of the Submerged Lands Act must be one which by virtue of Congressional action would have been <em>legally effective </em>to carry, as between State and Nation, submerged land rights under the <em>Pollard </em>rule, as Congress conceived that rule to have been prior to this Court\u2019s decision in the <em>California </em>case, 332 U. S. 19. That test supplies the meaning and content not only of the phrase \u201cboundaries ... as they existed at the time such State became a member of the Union,\u201d but also of the phrase \u201cboundaries ... as heretofore approved by Congress,\u201d contained in \u00a7 2 of the Submerged Lands Act <em>(ante, </em>p. 9, note 7). Florida must satisfy that test if it is to prevail in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">The Court\u2019s Florida opinion conceives the issue to be whether Congress in 1868 made a \u201cgeneral scrutiny of all the provisions of\u201d Florida\u2019s Constitution, and states that the Submerged Lands Act requires only that it have been \u201cexamined and approved as a whole.\u201d The concurring opinion asserts that the relevant inquiry is \u201cwhether congressional approval of the new Florida Constitution . . . amounted to an approval of the three-league boundary which that constitution explicitly set forth.\u201d In my view, neither formulation adequately characterizes the nature of the question left by the Submerged Lands Act to this Court. It may be conceded that Congress scrutinized all the provisions of Florida\u2019s Constitution and that by accepting the Constitution it, in an abstract sense, approved the boundary provision. The further and controlling inquiry that must be made is whether the <em>legal effect </em>of such action was to establish a valid three-league boundary for Florida. If not, Florida would not have owned the submerged lands to that distance under Congress\u2019 concept of the <em>Pollard </em>rule, and it would therefore be entitled to no better rights under the Submerged Lands Act. On neither branch of its claims do I believe that Florida\u2019s showing measures up to that standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">My difficulty with Florida\u2019s \u201creadmission\u201d claim begins with the proposition that a State relying on a readmission boundary stands on quite a different legal footing than one relying on an original admission boundary. In the latter instance the .fixing of a boundary is a necessary incident of Congress\u2019 power to admit new States. A newly admitted State, in the absence of an express fixation of its boundary by the Congressional act of admission or an articulated rejection of its preadmission boundary, may, I think, rely on a presumed Congressional purpose to adopt whatever boundary the political entity had immediately prior to its admission as a State.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> That would seem to be the effect of <em>New Mexico </em>v. <em>Colorado, </em>267 U. S. 30, and <em>New Mexico </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>275 U. S. 279, 276 U. S. 557.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">Different considerations, however, obtain in the case of a State readmitted to \u201crepresentation in Congress\u201d after the Civil War. Such a State renounced the Union with boundaries already fixed by Congress at the time of orig<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>inal admission. When it was restored to full participation in the Union, there is no reason to suppose its territorial limits would not remain the same. So much indeed finds sound support in the constitutional doctrines evolved in the so-called reconstruction cases, even though they related to different problems arising out of the Civil War. See <em>Texas </em>v. <em>White, </em>7 Wall. 700, 726; <em>White </em>v. <em>Hart, </em>13 Wall. 646, 649-652; <em>Gunn </em>v. <em>Barry, </em>15 Wall. 610, 623; <em>Keith </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>97 U. S. 454, 461. Since, as will be shown later <em>(post, </em>pp. 140-141), Florida renounced the Union with a seaward boundary no greater than three miles, the issue here is whether upon readmission Congress <em>changed </em>that boundary to three leagues. Unlike the situation at original admission, where the necessity of fixing some boundary for a newly admitted State leads readily to the presumption of Congressional approval of a tendered preadmission boundary, no similar presumption arises in connection with an alleged change in a state boundary already fixed by Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">After a painstaking examination of the legislative materials I can find no evidence whatever that the Congress intended to change Florida\u2019s seaward boundary from one not in excess of three miles to one of three leagues when the State was readmitted to representation in 1868. Certainly the Act of readmission (Act of June 25, 1868,15 Stat. 73), upon which Florida relies, affords no basis for a claim that Congress <em>expressly </em>approved the State\u2019s three-league boundary provision.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The statute refers in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>no way to boundaries; it does not even undertake to approve Florida\u2019s Constitution, let alone the boundaries described therein; and it is entitled merely as \u201cAn Act to admit . . . Florida, to Representation in Congress,\u201d not as an act to admit it to the Union. Cf. <em>White </em>v. <em>Hart, supra, </em>at 652.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>Nor can I find any basis in the legislative record for a conclusion that' Congress <em>impliedly </em>changed Florida\u2019s boundary. The Congressional debates and reports may be searched in vain for a single reference \u2014 even a casual one \u2014 to the boundaries of any of the readmitted States. The preamble of the Act of June 25, 1868, and the Congressional debates affirmatively show that all with which Congress was concerned was whether the constitutions of the readmitted States had been validly adopted and were republican in structure, and, in a few instances, whether they contained provisions in palpable violation of the Federal Constitution.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> No territorial questions at all appear to have figured in the debates. In these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>circumstances the case of <em>Virginia </em>v. <em>Tennessee, </em>148 U. S. 503, upon which Florida relies in support of its argument as to implied approval, is quite inapposite. There the two States had made a compact with respect to the boundary between them. Subsequently Congress adopted the line so established in setting up districts for judicial, revenue, election, and appointive purposes. It was held that Congress had thereby impliedly approved the interstate compact. <em>Id., </em>521-522. In the present instance we have no affirmative action by Congress respecting the 1868 proffered Florida boundary in any way comparable to that in this earlier case.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">Nor can a purpose to change Florida\u2019s boundary be inferred from the bare context of the Congressional action. The constitutional area in which the Congress was moving in 1868 should not be forgotten. Congress was not undertaking to exercise its power to fix state boundaries incident to the admission of new States. Rather, it was engaged in \u201cre-establishing the broken relations of the State [s] with the Union,\u201d and in satisfying itself that the constitutions of the States lately in rebellion had been validly adopted and were republican in form, all pursuant to Congress\u2019 constitutional obligation to guarantee to each State a republican form of government. See <em>Texas </em>v. <em>White, supra, </em>727-728. This is not to say that Congress <em>could </em>not at the same time have changed any State\u2019s original admission boundary, but only to raise the question whether it in fact <em>did </em>so. While the exercise of a particular constitutional power does not of course preclude resort to others, the nature of the power exerted in 1868 does seem to me to negative the idea that Congress also purported to exercise its power to change Florida\u2019s boundary.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>In the last analysis I think that Florida\u2019s claim here could only be sustained on the view that Congress was under a <em>duty </em>to speak with reference to the State\u2019s boundary provision, failing which Congress\u2019 silence should as a matter of law be deemed the equivalent of acceptance of the provision. In light of factors already adverted to I cannot perceive how such a duty could be found to exist. To uphold Florida\u2019s claim on any such theory would be novel doctrine indeed, particularly where property rights of the United States are involved. Cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>California, supra, </em>at 39-40. Moreover, to say that such a duty existed seems to me to misconceive the nature of the \u201capproval\u201d of the constitutions of the seceded States contemplated by the reconstruction statutes. Such approval was not of the sort involved in the case of a constitution submitted to a constitutional convention for adoption or ratification, where the failure to reject a particular provision would be equivalent to its acceptance. Instead, the whole tenor of the reconstruction debates clearly shows that all that was meant by \u201capproval\u201d was that before any seceded State was restored to representation, Congress must be satisfied that its constitution had been properly adopted and was republican in its general structure. That kind of a requirement of \u201capproval\u201d does not lend itself to the conclusion that this Court would be attributing to the 1868 Congress a \u201cdeceptive subtlety\u201d unless it regards silence upon Florida\u2019s boundary provision as tantamount to its acceptance. Especially so, when that provision was quite outside the realm of matters upon which Congress <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>had been called upon to act. \u201cGreat acts of State\u201d these events of the reconstruction period were indeed, but I do not think they can now be taken as having encompassed acceptance of the territorial pretensions of any particular State.</p>\n<p id=\"AFN\">In sum, I believe the conclusion inescapable that all that Congress can properly be taken to have done in readmitting Florida was to declare that nothing in the State\u2019s new constitution disqualified its Senators and Representatives from taking their seats in Congress. While such action may in some abstract sense have constituted \u201capproval\u201d of Florida\u2019s boundary provision:, since it was included in its constitution, in my opinion it did not represent the sort of advertent, affirmative Congressional action which legally would have been necessary to effectuate an actual change in Florida\u2019s original admission boundary. It therefore did not \u201capprove\u201d Florida\u2019s three-league boundary within the only sense contemplated by the Submerged Lands Act.</p>\n<p id=\"Afq\">II</p>\n<p id=\"AIW\">It is clear that the State fares no better on its alternative claim, based upon its original admission boundary. Since the Court does not reach this claim, it will be enough to state briefly the reasons which require its rejection.</p>\n<p id=\"AHV\">The territory which now comprises the State of Florida was originally acquired by England from France and Spain by the Treaty of Paris of February 10, 1763.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> By the proclamation of October 7, 1763,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> King George III divided the acquired territory into East and West Florida. East Florida was declared to be \u201cbounded to the west<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>ward by the Gulf of Mexico and the Apalachicola river . . . and to the east and south by the Atlantic ocean and the gulf of Florida, including all islands within six leagues of the sea coast.\u201d West Florida was declared to be \u201cbounded to the southward by the gulf of Mexico, including all islands within six leagues of the coast, from the river Apalachicola to Lake Pontchartrain . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">By the Treaty of Versailles of September 3, 1783, England ceded to Spain the territory described merely as \u201cEast Florida, as also West Florida.\u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> By the Treaty of Amity, Settlement, and Limits of February 22, 1819, Spain ceded to the United States \u201call the territories which belong to [Spain], situated to the eastward of the Mississippi, known by the name of East and West Florida.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Both the Act establishing Florida as a Territory,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and the Act admitting it to the Union,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> describe it in terms of the territories of East and West Florida ceded by the Treaty of 1819.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">Florida contends that the provision in King George\u2019s proclamation relating to all islands within six leagues of the coast was an assertion of a territorial boundary at that distance along the entire coast, and that subsequent conveyances necessarily incorporated that description. The opinion of the Court relating to Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama disposes of that contention (ante, pp. 66-82), and what has been said there need not be repeated here.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>Florida also relies on many of the same treaties as does Louisiana to show that this country's predecessors in title claimed large amounts of territorial sea. Without elaborating on what has already been said <em>(ante, </em>pp. 73-74), it is sufficient to point out here that these treaties did not constitute territorial assertions, but merely established obligations between the parties of a special and limited nature, and varied so widely in the distances specified as not to be of any value whatever in showing a uniform practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">I would grant the Government\u2019s motion for judgment as to Florida.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b182-8\"> More is required of Texas in this case because of the manner in which the Joint Resolution admitting Texas to the Union was drawn.

The actual physical location of those respective boundaries, however, was in dispute. In the former, the Court held that the location of the boundary was fixed by the event of admission in accordance with a survey of the 37th parallel which had been theretofore made, even though it might not have been a correct survey. In the latter case, it held that since the location of the Rio Grande\u2019s channel in 1850 had been continuously accepted as the location of New Mexico\u2019s boundary prior to statehood, and had been so specified in its constitution when admitted to the Union, that became the location of the State\u2019s boundary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b183-6\"> In pertinent part the Act reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-7\">\u201cWhereas the people of North Carolina, South Carolina, Louisiana, Georgia, Alabama, and Florida have, in pursuance of the provisions of an act entitled \u2018An act for the more efficient government of the rebel States,\u2019 passed March second, eighteen hundred and sixty-seven, and the acts supplementary thereto [see note 4, <em>post], </em>framed constitutions of State government which are republican, and have adopted said constitutions by large majorities of the votes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>cast at the elections held for the ratification or rejection of <em>the </em>same: Therefore,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-5\"><em>\u201cBe it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, </em>That each of the States of North Carolina, South Carolina, Louisiana, Georgia, Alabama, and Florida, shall be entitled and admitted to representation in Congress as a State of the Union when the legislature of such State shall have duly ratified the amendment to the Constitution of the United States proposed by the Thirty-ninth Congress, and known as article fourteen, upon the following fundamental conditions: That the constitutions of neither of said States shall ever be so amended or changed as to deprive any citizen or class of citizens of the United States of the right to vote in said State, who are entitled to vote by the constitution thereof herein recognized, except as a punishment for such crimes as are now felonies at common law, whereof they shall have been duly convicted under laws equally applicable to all the inhabitants of said State: <em>Provided, </em>That any alteration of said constitution may be made with regard to the time and place of residence of voters; and the State of Georgia shall only be entitled and admitted to representation upon this further fundamental condition: that the first and third subdivisions of section seventeen of the fifth article of the constitution of said State, except the proviso to the first subdivision, shall be null and void, and that the general assembly of said State by solemn public act shall declare the assent of the State to the foregoing fundamental condition.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b184-6\"> Reliance is placed on the Act of March 2, 1867, 14 Stat. 428, providing for a State\u2019s readmission when, among other things, its \u201cconstitution shall have been submitted to Congress for examination and approval, and Congress shall have approved the same I find nothing in this provision, or in those of any of the other so-called reconstruction legislation, Act of March 23, 1867, 15 Stat. 2; Act of July 19, 1867, 15 Stat. 14; Act of March 11, 1868, 15 Stat. 41, which warrants the conclusion that the constitutions of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>readmitted States were to be \u201capproved\u201d by Congress, except in the sense that Congress must be satisfied that they had been duly adopted and were republican in form.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b185-8\"> The following excerpts from the Congressional debates are typical of many others: \u201cNow, sir, what is the particular question we are considering?
