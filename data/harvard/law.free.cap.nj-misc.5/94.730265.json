By the borough of Haworth an assessment of $117,700, called reservoir and intake. By the borough of Emerson an assessment of $150,000, called reservoir and improvements. Those assessments were canceled by the state board of taxes and assessment on the ground that they were duplicate assessments. With this conclusion of the state board we agree. The state board filed a memorandum stating its reasons for the action taken. That memorandum in part is as follows: \u201cWe are now asked by the respondent to add this assessment [i. e., the borough of Closter] to the value of the lands already assessed and on which taxes have been paid. This should not be done, as there is nothing before us to indicate whether or not such a course would increase the assessment of the lands beyond their true value. There was no testimony taken relative to the value of these lands. The appellant contends that we are dealing with a duplicate assessment, while the respondent insists that the board should correct the misnomer, revise the assessment and add the amount in dispute to the assessed value of the land. We prefer to regard this assessment as a duplication, with the result that it is canceled and the action of the Bergen county board of taxation reversed.\u201d We concur in the above reasons of the state board. Hence, the judgment in each of the three cases is affirmed and the rule to show cause why a <em>certiorari </em>should not issue heretofore granted in each ease is discharged.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
