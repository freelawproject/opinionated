The cause was tried at the Essex Circuit Court in the absence of counsel for the defendant, under circumstances which we deem sufficient to warrant a setting aside of the judgment. That this should be the disposition of the matter is made more conclusive by an examination of the evidence upon which the verdict was founded.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-14\">The judgment and verdict are therefore set aside and a <em>venire de novo </em>awarded; costs to await the result of a retrial of the issue.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
