JOHN G. SCOTT, BUILDING INSPECTOR OF THE CITY OF EAST ORANGE, ET AL.</parties>\n<otherdate data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b77-4\">Argued October term, 1926</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"ADW\">Decided December 30, 1926.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b77-7\">Before Gum mere, Grief Justice, and Justices Trenuhard and M intern.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b77-8\">For the relator, <em>Leber &amp; liuback.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b77-9\">For the respondents, <em>Walter O.

The city has been divided into districts, and in certain districts, apparently, for police and sanitary reasons the erection of a public garage is prohibited.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">In <em>Hench </em>v. <em>East </em>Orange, 2 <em>N. J. Mis. R. </em>510, we declare that the presumption is that such a zoning ordinance is within the police power, and the burden is on the property owner to show the contrary; and quite recently that rule was applied to the ordinance in question, in the case of <em>Long </em>v. Scott, 4 <em>Id. </em>587, where the same prohibition was laid against vacant land, and it was declared that the burden was on the relator to show that the provision in question was not reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">In the case of <em>Portnof </em>v. Bigelow, 4 <em>N. J. Mis. R. </em>539, this court refused to permit a public garage in a residential district, saying: \u201cWe are unable to perceive anything unreasonable about forbidding a large public garage in the midst of a continuous block of closely-built dwelling-houses. How much stronger is the present case in its ground for refusal, in the known built-up character of'the residence district, the proximity of school houses to the relator\u2019s land, and the physical division of Park avenue as a street.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">We think these adjudications sufficiently declare the governing legal principle, and clarify the situation presented by the facts in this case, to warrant the denial of the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">Such will be the rule.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
