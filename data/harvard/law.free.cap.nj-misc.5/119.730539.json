Each of the plaintiffs obtained verdicts. Application was made to the trial judge for rules to show cause, and such application was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>denied by him. The application for such rules is now made to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">The points urged are:</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">1. A nonsuit should have been granted because no negligence was established against the defendant and because of the contributory negligence of the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">2. The verdicts are against the weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">3. The verdicts are excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">Our examination of the matter satisfies us that the application for the rules should be denied, and it is therefore denied, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
