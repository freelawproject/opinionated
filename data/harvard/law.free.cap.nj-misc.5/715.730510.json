The building inspector denied the permit for the sole reason that the land in question was in residence \u201cA\u201d district, which was zoned against apartment-houses.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">The relator thereupon obtained an alternative writ of <em>mandamus </em>to which a return was made, which was demurred to. There is also presented a stipulation as to the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">It thereby appears that the city of Orange has a board of adjustment, whose powers have been amplified by the act of <em>1926, </em>chapter 315, and that no appeal was taken by the relator to that board. In that situation the relator is not entitled to a writ of <em>mandamus </em>against the building inspector. So the Supreme Court has determined in several cases. See <em>Burg </em>v. <em>Ackerman, </em>5 <em>N. J. Mis. R. </em>96; <em>Paramount Realty Co. </em>v. <em>Schmitt, </em>5 <em>Id. </em>177; <em>State </em>v. <em>Dowling, </em>5 <em>Id. </em>180.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">The application for the writ of <em>mandamus </em>must be denied, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
