The trial judge\u2019s finding on the evidence* was that there was a failure to exercise that degree of care upon the part of the defendants sufficient to rebut the presumption of negligence and gave judgment for the plaintiff as above stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">The only two grounds relied on and argued in the brief of counsel of appellant are: 1. That there are no facts supporting the finding of negligence. 3. That there was no competent evidence as to the damage submitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">Neither of these contentions seems to be sound. The contract of storage was that the automobile was not to be taken out of the garage without the permission of the nlaintiff. No such permission had been given by the plaintiff. That the automobile was taken out of the garage without permission of the plaintiff and damaged is not fairly open to dispute. There was therefore proof of a breach of the contract of storage by the defendants for which breach the defendants are answerable. The motion for a nonsuit was therefore properly denied. We think the facts of the present case fall within the reasoning of Mr. Justice Swayze, speaking for this court in <em>Corbett </em>v. <em>Smeraldo, </em>91 <em>N. J. L. </em>39 (at <em>p. </em>30) ; 103 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>889.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">In <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>McDonald, </em>70 <em>N. J. L. </em>594, the general legal principle is laid down that where chattels are delivered to a bailee in good condition and are returned to the bailor in a damaged state, the law will presume the negligence of the plaintiff to have been the cause. In the cited case, a mare in sound condition when delivered for hire to the defendant was later in the day returned by the defendant to the owner suffering from a fracture of the illium of the left leg and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>the owner was permitted to recover his damages from the defendant on the ground that the injury to the mare, in the absence of exculpating circumstances, will be presumed to have resulted from negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\">The ground of appeal, that there was no competent evidence of the damage sustained by the plaintiff, is without substance. An expert automobile mechanic who, after qualifying as such, testified as to his knowledge of the cost of repairs and of parts of automobiles; that he had examined the automobile in question, and estimated the reasonable cost of necessary repairs to it at $119, for which sum judgment was given.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">Judgment is affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
