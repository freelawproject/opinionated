Mylod.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b937-9\">Eor the appellee, <em>Sidney W.

The other \u201cspecifications\u201d are either general, <em>i. </em>e., they do not specify (Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4) or point to no judicial action whatever (No. 6).</p>\n<p id=\"b937-12\">The first specification, that the court allowed the witness Hays to be cross-examined over objection regarding his knowledge of the custom of plaintiff\u2019s business, is technically faulty, but we have examined the point on its merits. Hays was called by plaintiff as subscribing witness to a document. It was, of course, technical error to permit cross-examination outside of that point; but, practically, it was harmless, as a moment later defendant made Hays his own witness, and whether he was testifying on direct or cross meant nothing to the jury under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-13\">As to the refusal to nonsuit: Murphy had been in the employ of Larkin company and resigned March 31st, to take <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"922\">*922</page-number>effect May 1st. The company discharged him as of March 31st. It was open to the jury to find that he was employed by the month, and hence entitled to a month\u2019s notice, which was not given. <em>Beach </em>v. Mullin, 34 <em>N. J. L. </em>343. Plaintiff had advanced Murphy moneys aggregating $266.66, and when he resigned exacted of him an I O U in the following language:</p>\n<p id=\"b938-4\">\u201cMarch 31st, 1925.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-5\">\u201cMy resignation as salesman with J. K. Larkin &amp; Co., Inc., 253 Broadway, New York City, has been accepted by them to-day and effective to-day.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-6\">\u201cThis is to state that I owe J. K. Larkin &amp; Co., Inc., New York, the sum of $266.'66. This amount is due to $100 loaned me by the company quite some time ago, and $166.66 for advanced salary made by Mr. Brodhead, former treasurer of J. K. Larkin &amp; Co., Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-7\">\u201cThere are no legal defenses in the above amount of $266.66.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-8\">\u201cJames B. Murphy.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-9\">\u201cWitness:</p>\n<p id=\"b938-10\">\u201cWm. C. Hays,</p>\n<p id=\"b938-11\">\n<em>\u201cVice-President, J. K. Larkin &amp; Co., Inc.\"</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b938-12\">This paper was the basis of the plaintiff\u2019s suit. Murphy filed a set-off for two weeks\u2019 wages, amounting to $166.66, which the jury allowed, and awarded plaintiff the balance of $100.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-13\">It is argued that this paper is a contract. It is not; it is an admission of indebtedness but not conclusive, and subject to attack by parol testimony like a receipt, or a promissory note as between the parties maker and payee.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-14\">It is further argued that there was no consideration for the agreement alleged by Murphy in his testimony, that plaintiff promised him half a month\u2019s wages in view of his quitting at once. But if Murphy was entitled to a month\u2019s notice, or even if there was a fair question whether he was so entitled, the settlement of that was a legal consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-15\">We find no injurious error properly assigned, and conclude that the judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
