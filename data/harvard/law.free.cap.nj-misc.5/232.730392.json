Record, page 11. In that decision, the facts are quite fully and clearly stated. The statute under which the order is sought is cited, viz., <em>Pamph. L. </em>1911, <em>p. </em>374, \u00a7 17, and the reasons given for the making of the order dismissing the prosecutor\u2019s petition. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>We think no further discussions of the points involved is required, other than what is contained in the board\u2019s written decision. Eor the reasons therein stated, the order of the board, dated September 30th, 1926, dismissing the prosecutor\u2019s petition, is affirmed, and the writ of <em>certiorari </em>is dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
