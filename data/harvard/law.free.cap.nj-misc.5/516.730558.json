Nutley, 99 <em>N. J. L. 389. </em>That case in the Court of Errors and Appeals is binding on this court in the absence of modification by that court, and as yet there has been none.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-14\">The relator is entitled to judgment, with costs, and a peremptory writ will issue.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
