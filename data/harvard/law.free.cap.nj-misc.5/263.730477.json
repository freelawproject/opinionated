J. L. </em>205.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-12\">The application for re-argument is denied because in the opinion of this court discharging the rule to show cause it was not held that the testimony respecting ventilation was irrelevant and because the verdict of the plaintiff Anthony Toseani cannot be attacked \u2014 because nowhere before or at the trial was it urged that a recovery could not be had because of the reasons urged upon the argument of the rule to show cause based upon <em>Hetzel </em>v. <em>Wasson Piston Ring Co., supra.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
