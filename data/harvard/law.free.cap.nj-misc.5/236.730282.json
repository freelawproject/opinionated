Reasons for- setting aside the motion or order passed by the commission granting a license or consent to operate motor buses from Hackensack to Little Ferry, New Jersey.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-13\">The <em>certiorari </em>is attacked on the ground that nowhere in the record or state of the case does the right of the prosecutor appear to have allowed a writ of <em>certiorari. </em>There is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>nothing to show any personal or property interests of the prosecutor affected by the action of the Hackensack improvement commission, in granting the permit or license to the Suburban Bus Line, Incorporated. There is nothing to show who or what the prosecutor, Public Service Railway Company, is or how it is affected. This is imperative under the case of <em>Tallon </em>v. <em>Hoboken, </em>60 <em>N. J. L. </em>212, in the Court of Errors and Appeals. There the rule is stated, thus, <em>\u201ccertiorari </em>will not lie in favor of private prosecutors to review the action of public officials, unless such prosecutors have a personal or property interest which will be specially and immediately affected by the action complained of\u201d or \u201cunless he shows that he will suffer a special injury.\u201d The writ of <em>certiorari </em>will therefore be dismissed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
