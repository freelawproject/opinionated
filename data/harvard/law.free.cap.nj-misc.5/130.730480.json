The trial resulted in a verdict in favor of each of the plaintiffs against the Franklin company.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-12\">The only grounds upon which we are asked to make the rule absolute are that the trial court erred in refusing to nonsuit the plaintiffs, and also in refusing to direct a verdict in favor of the defendant the Franklin company.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-13\">Our examination of the proofs in the case satisfies us that there was no error in the rulings complained of. The question whether Yannitte was negligent, and whether his negligence if it was proved, was the sole cause of the collision, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>were clearly question^ of fact to be determined by the jury. So, too, the question whether Yannitte at the time of this accident was an employe of the Franklin company, and then engaged in the latter\u2019s service, was also a question for the jury. The rule to show cause will be discharged.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
