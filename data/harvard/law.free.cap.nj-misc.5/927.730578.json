That thereafter hills were sent to the defendant and never returned, objected to, or paid. That a few days before the trial some of the goods in question were bought from the defendant at the latter\u2019s place of business.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-14\">The defendant\u2019s evidence was that he bought the goods from Brower as principal, and paid him therefor; that he returned the bills sent to him by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"928\">*928</page-number>The defendant\u2019s appeal is rested upon the contention that there was no evidence of agency. We think there was sufficient in the facts and circumstances to present a jury question. It has been held that \u201cwhere goods are bought by a person claiming to have authority to order from the plaintiff, and are shipped by the plaintiff in cases plainly marked with his address, and bills and demands are sent to the defendant to which no reply is made, it is for the jury to judge of the circumstances.\u201d <em>Sturtevant </em>v.
