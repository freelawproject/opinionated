A public school; 2. A duly-organized school giving regular instruction at least five days a week for eight or more months a year; 3. A hospital; 4. A church; 5. A theatre or opera house or other building used or intended to be used for theatrical \"or operatic purposes or for public entertainment; 6. A public library; or <em>7. </em>A public art museum.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">The Supreme Court, on application of the relator, awarded an alternative writ in an opinion reported in 4 <em>N. J. Mis. R. </em>819. We have now a demurrer to the return made to such writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-9\">No doubt such provision of the ordinance, so far as it goes, is a legitimate exercise of the police power of the municipality. It has been so determined by <em>Schait </em>v. <em>Senior, 97 N. J. L. </em>390 But there is raised by the pleadings the ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>tion -whether the language of the ordinance \u201csituated within a radius of two hundred feet of (1) a public school,\u201d &amp;c., means within a radius of two hundred feet of the building in question, or means the nearest point of the curtilage, and, hence, whether the present ease is within the ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">This question is raised because we have the following state of facts: Diagonally opposite the nearest corner of the lot proposed to he utilized for a gasoline station are the grounds and buildings of a church orphan asylum. The tract of land is about seven hundred and thirty feet in front on Lyons avenue, and about seven hundred and eighty feet deep, and all the buildings are set well back from the street, and toward the middle of the tract. The nearest corner of the land is one hundred and five and six-tenths feet from the nearest corner of the relator\u2019s premises, while the nearest corner of the nearest building (marked \u201cchapel and home\u201d) is two hundred and sixty-six feet; of an outlying chapel, three hundred and twelve feet; of the \u201cschool building,\u201d about three hundred and eighty-live feet.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">We feel constrained to hold that the present case is not within the ordinance, which, being designed to limit the use of property, must be construed strictly.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">The result is that a peremptory writ must he awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
