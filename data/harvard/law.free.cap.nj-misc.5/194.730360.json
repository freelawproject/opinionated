The defense was that plaintiff did not fall in front of defendant\u2019s premises, but in front of a neighboring property. The jury found in favor of the defendant on January 21st, 1926. This rule to show cause why a new trial should not he granted on the ground of newly-discovered evidence, was not applied for until six months later.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-12\">Our examination of the proofs result in the conclusion that the newly-discovered evidence is merely cumulative and corroborative of evidence heard at the trial, and, hence, more especially in view of the long delay, will not justify a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-13\">The rule will be discharged.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
