First, because the ordinance in section 6 provides, such application for licenses, \u201cthe same <em>may </em>be approved and allowed after the expiration of fifteen days from the date of its filing, and thereupon when such approval is endorsed upon such application,\u201d &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">This seems to invest a discretion in the commissioners; if so, a <em>mandamus </em>never issues when the subject if one of discretion. <em>Uszkay </em>v. Dill, 92 <em>N. J. L. </em>327.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">The board is not required to license any sort of a place that an applicant may wish to conduct. Even if there is no discretion under the ordinance, the writ must be denied in this ease because the facts and the law are not settled and clear; in such cases the writ is never directed to issue. <em>Browne </em>v. Lee, 98 <em>N. J. L. </em>4; <em>Borough of Secaucus </em>v. <em>Kiesewetter, </em>83 <em>Id. </em>227.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">The rule to show cause will be discharged and the issuing of a writ of <em>mandamus </em>denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
