The relator owned a plot of ground in East Orange. He applied to the building inspector of the city for a permit for the erection thereon of a two-story brick building to be used for stores and offices. The permit was refused upon the sole ground that the proposed building was in a district designated as a medium volume residence district in the zoning ordinance of the city, in which a building of the character proposed by the relator was excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-12\">We think that this case falls within the case of <em>State </em>v. <em>Nutley, 99 N. J. L. </em>389. That case in the Court of Errors and Appeals is binding on this court in the absence of modification by that court, and as yet there has been none.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-13\">The relator is entitled to judgment, with costs, and a peremptory writ will issue.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
