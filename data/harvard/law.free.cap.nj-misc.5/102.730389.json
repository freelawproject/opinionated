Application was made to the building inspector, who denied it, and then the matter was brought before the borough council at a meeting held September 13th, 1926, which body also denied the application upon the ground that the proposed apartment-house, if constructed, would violate the set-back regulation of the building code as well as the provisions of the zoning ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-12\">The zoning ordinance regulates and restricts development in Knox avenue, in the section where relator\u2019s property is situated, to one and two-family houses.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-13\">Section 18 of the building code provides as follows: \u201cWhere at least one-half of the buildings situated on either side of the street between two intersecting streets conform to a minimum set-back line, no new buildings shall be erected and no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>existing building shall be reconstructed or altered to project beyond such set-back line.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\">Such a provision in an ordinance we think so clearly violates the constitutional rights o\u00ed property owners as not to permit of argument or require citation of authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">The other reasons assigned by respondents against the allowance of the writ applied for are such only as have been repeatedly passed upon by the Court of Errors and Appeals and this court, adversely to respondents\u2019 contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">The question of appeal to the board of adjustment is not raised by respondents nor have we before us any proof that such a board or body exists in the borough of Cliifside Park.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">A peremptory writ of <em>mandamus </em>is therefore allowed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
