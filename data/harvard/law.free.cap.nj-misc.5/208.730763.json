In the stipulation of facts it appears that the relator was the owner of property in Maplewood, on which stood a one-family house. He applied for a permit to convert the same into a two-family house according to .certain plans and specifications. The building inspector declined to issue the permit for the erection and alterations of the building solely because a zoning ordinance of the township of Maplewood zoned the property in question as a single-family residence district.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-12\">Of course, under the authority of <em>State </em>v. <em>Nutley, </em>99 <em>N.
