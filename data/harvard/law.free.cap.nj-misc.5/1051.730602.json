On the last day of the agreement Katzen took Louis Satinov to Crumbie as a purchaser, and the latter made formal tender of performance under its terms. This Crumbie refused, declaring that he did not know Katzen. The action was then brought by Young to the use of himself and Katzen, trading as partners, and on the trial a verdict was directed by the court in favor of the plaintiff for $15,000. To this ruling an exception was taken by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-8\">Among the grounds of appeal is one that the contract was presonal to Young and that Crumbie was not obliged to deal with Katzen. We think the direction of a verdict was error. A broker or agent authorized to sell property or to procure a purchaser is ordinarly without authority to delegate his powers to another. 2 <em>Corp. Jur. </em>686, and cases cited. There is nothing in the ease to indicate that it is an exception to the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-9\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
