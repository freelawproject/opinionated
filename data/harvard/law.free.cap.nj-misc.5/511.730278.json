MORRIS RUBIN, PLAINTIFF IN ERROR.</parties>\n<otherdate data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b527-6\">Submitted January 28, 1927</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AE7\">Decided May 13, 1927.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b527-9\">Before Gummbbe, Chief Justice, and Mr. Justice Teenciiaed.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b527-10\">Eor the plaintiff in error, <em>John J. Carlin (George E. Cutley, </em>of counsel).</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b527-11\">For the defendant in error, <em>John Milton, </em>prosecutor of the pleas.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b527-12\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"b527-13\">Bubin was convicted in the Hudson County Quarter Sessions upon an indictment charging him with larceny from the person in that he stole $65 from one Charles E. Sparrow.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>The testimony tended to show that Sparrow was on the Hudson tube train in the midst of a crowd and found himself jostled by two men; that one of them was Rubin, who hit him on the left trousers pocket as Sparrow was leaving the train, and took $65 from his pocket. Upon-Rubin\u2019s arrest later Sparrow identified him as the man who jostled him and who picked his pocket.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">The defendant complains that the judge erred in refusing to direct a verdict of not guilty at the close of the testimony. That complaint is manifestly without merit. Indeed, no reason for such action was suggested.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">It is next said that by the charge of the court the jury \u201cwere led to believe that their function was not to acquit the defendant if the evidence satisfied them beyond a reasonable doubt, but were justified in finding tlie defendant guilty according to a criterion which has no basis in the criminal law.\u201d Whatever that may mean, our examination of the whole charge satisfies us that there is no merit in the apparent contention. The jury was told distinctly and without qualifications that it was their duty to acquit unless defendant\u2019s guilt was established to the satisfaction of the jury beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">The defendant contends that there was error in the comment of the judge upon the failure of the defendant to testify. We think that the comment was justified by the rule in <em>State </em>v. <em>Kisik, </em>99 <em>N. J. L. </em>385.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">Other objections to the charge are without merit, the matters objected to being legitimate comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-8\">The judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
