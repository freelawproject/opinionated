The application was refused by the building inspector on the ground that the lot upon which the building was to he erected was in a part of the city zoned by ordinance for residences only. The present writ was then allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-12\">An examination of the petition for the; writ and of the return to the writ itself evinces that the case falls squarely within the decision of the Court of Errors and Appeals in <em>Ignaciunas </em>v. <em>Risley, </em>98 <em>N. J. L. </em>712.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-13\">The facts not being in dispute, a peremptory writ will be awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
