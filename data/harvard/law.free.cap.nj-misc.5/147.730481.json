The building to be thirty feet deep, twenty feet in width, fourteen feet in height, to be set back from the building line twenty feet, to be used for the storage of ice. The application was rejected on the ground that the land on which the building is proposed to be erected is located in a district zoned by the board for residential purposes. We think a peremptory writ of <em>mandamus </em>should issue as prayed for upon the condition that the relator comply with all the preliminary conditions, such as getting a permit from the superintendent of buildings or to file plans with such official as is required by the building code of Jersey City. Such will be the order of the court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
