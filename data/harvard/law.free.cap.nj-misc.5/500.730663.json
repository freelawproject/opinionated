J. L. </em>389. That case in the Court of Errors and Appeals is binding in this court in the absence of modification in that court, and as yet there has been none.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-14\">The relator is entitled to judgment, with costs, and a peremptory writ will issue.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
