This is so fundamental that no citation of authorities is called for.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-13\">The proposed ordinance, if adopted, would by its terms legalize acts in the city of Camden which the supreme law making body of the state has prohibited by that legislation known as the Yice and Immorality act.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-14\">The resolution under review must therefore be set aside, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
