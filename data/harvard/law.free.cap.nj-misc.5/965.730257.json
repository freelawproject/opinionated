The defendant appealed and filed seven grounds of appeal, only two of which are argued in the appellants\u2019 brief, viz., the sixth and seventh. We find no error, except in the amount of damages. There is nothing in the case to show that the plaintiff was under any legal obligation to pay the lender the interest sued for. Nor is there anything to show that the defendants agreed to pay interest by way of damages for a breach of their agreement to accept the loan of $50,000. But as we find the only question with respect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"966\">*966</page-number>to which the verdict is wrong is the amount of the verdict, which is senarable, the jury having settled the question of liability upon sufficient evidence, the judgment will be affirmed for $1,600 under the case of <em>Robinson </em>v. Payne, 99 <em>N-. J. L. </em>135.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-4\">The judgment of the Atlantic County Circuit Court will be affirmed for $1,600.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
