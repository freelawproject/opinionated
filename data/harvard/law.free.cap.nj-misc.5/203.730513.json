STEPHEN KAPUSA AND GREENSPAN BROTHERS, INCORPORATED, A CORPORATION, DEFENDANTS.</parties>\n<otherdate data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b219-4\">Submitted October 16, 1920</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"ArN\">Decided January 28, 1927.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b219-7\">Before Gummere, Chief Justice, and Justices Trenchaed and Minturn.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b219-8\">For the plaintiff, <em>Isidor M. Diibrow.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b219-9\">For the defendant Greenspan Brothers, Incorporated, <em>Freeman Woodbridge.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b219-10\">For the defendant Stephen Kapusa, <em>Kalisch &amp; Kalisch.</em></attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b219-11\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"b219-12\">These are two rales to show cause. The plaintiff sued the two defendants to recover for injuries sustained by him while riding with defendant Kapusa, on the latter\u2019s invitation, in the latter\u2019s automobile, in a collision between the latter and the defendant Greenspan Brothers\u2019 automobile. The jury at the Middlesex Circuit rendered a verdict in favor of plaintiff and against defendant Greenspan Brothers for $2,500, and a verdict in favor of the defendant Kapusa of no cause of action. Greenspan Brothers obtained a rule to show cause why plaintiff\u2019s verdict and the verdict in favor of Kapusa should not be set aside; and the plaintiff obtained a rule to show cause why the verdict in favor of Kapusa should not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>be set aside, in which, it was also ordered that defendant Greenspan Brothers show cause why the verdict in favor of plaintiff, Sharkey, should not be set aside as inadequate as to damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">Briefly and generally stated, the evidence tended to show that the automobile of Kapusa, in which plaintiff was riding by invitation, was proceeding on the road from Rahway to Carteret at a speed of about twenty-five or thirty miles an hour; that \u00e1t a sharp curve in the road plaintiff and his companion sighted the automobile of defendant Greenspan Brothers suddenly rounding the sharp curve and on Greenspan\u2019s wrong side of the road; that plaintiff\u2019s driver immediately applied the brakes but the car skidded around and was struck by the Greenspan truck, which, according to the testimony, was proceeding \u201cpretty lively,\u201d in the rear, and jammed the plaintiff forward against the front seat of the car, breaking his leg.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">We think there was evidence of negligent operation of the truck of defendant Greenspan Brothers, and the verdict holding them is not against the weight of the evidence. We are also unable to say that the verdict of $2,500 against Greenspan Brothers, in favor of plaintiff, was inadequate as contended by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">With respect to the claim that the verdict in favor of Kapusa should be set aside, we think that the question of his negligence in the circumstances was properly resolved by the jury in the defendant\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">The rules to show cause will be discharged.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
