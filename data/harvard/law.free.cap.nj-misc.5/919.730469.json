The owner and the driver of the garbage truck were joined as defendants, but a nonsuit was allowed as to them, and the suit proceeded against the railway company.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-8\">The defendant\u2019s three points hinge on the contention that there was no proof of negligence as against the defendant company.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-9\">The defendant\u2019s case\u2018was that the garbage truck was stopped diagonally in the street away from the car tracks; that as the car approached the truck it started suddenly, and ran into the trolley car, thus causing the damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-10\">There was, however, also evidence that the garbage truck had proceeded slowly to a point alongside the parked auto, so that the seats of the two vehicles were abreast of each other when the trollej'' car struck the garbage truck, and forced it into the parked car, thus causing the damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-11\">The photographs offered in evidence showed the parked car of the plaintiff damaged in the front and on the side, but not in the rear. We think that situation presented a question of fact which was within the province of the court, sitting as a jury, to determine, and there being a reasonable basis of fact to support the judgment we will not disturb it.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-12\">The judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
