Case No. 272 is a rule to show cause why a writ of <em>mandamus </em>should not issue directing the award of the contract to be made to the next highest bidder, John H. Cooney, for $510,812. In these cases it is probably of more importance that a prompt decision be rendered than the form in which the decision may be expressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-12\">We have examined these cases with the following result:</p>\n<p id=\"b406-13\"><em>First. </em>We are unwilling to set aside the award of the contract in this case to Biggs, Distler &amp; Company for $509,000 on the sole ground that the specifications invite \u201calternative bids.\u201d The cases of <em>Armitage </em>v. Newark, 86 <em>N. J. L. </em>5; <em>Tice </em>v. <em>Long </em>Branch, 98 <em>Id. </em>214, are not in point on the facts. Our research has revealed no case in which this point has been directly considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number><em>Second. </em>We can find no evidence that the specifications have been unfairly manipulated in favor of the contractors to whom the award was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\"><em>Third. </em>The <em>addendum </em>provides: Nos. 3 <em>(2) </em>\u201cUnder the Vacuum Heating System necessary apparatus, specialties and valves as manufactured by Dunham Co., Barnes &amp; Jones, or other approved standard makes, shall be considered as equal to Warren &amp; Webster specialties, valves, traps,\u201d &amp;c. Under this clause $3,000 was deducted from Riggs, Distler &amp; Company bid of $512,000, thus reducing the bid to $509,000, making it the lowest bid and next to that of John H. Cooney of $510,812, to which $2,000 was to be added if the Warren &amp; Webster specialties were adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\"><em>Fourth. </em>The writ of <em>certiorari </em>is a discretionary writ. The suit is not a personal action. In the absence of fraud or manifest manipulation the award in this case should not be set aside at the instance of a taxpayer.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\"><em>The </em>cases <em>of McCarty </em>v. <em>Boulevard </em>Commissioners, 91 N. <em>J. L. </em>142; <em>affirmed, </em>92 <em>Id. </em>519; <em>Atlantic Gas, &amp;c., Co. </em>v. <em>Atlantic City, </em>73 <em>Id. </em>360, should be applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">Our conclusions are in Case No. 271 the writ of <em>certiorari </em>should be dismissed and the award of the contract to Riggs, Distler &amp; Company confirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-9\">In Case No-. 272 the rule to show cause should be discharged. No costs allowed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
