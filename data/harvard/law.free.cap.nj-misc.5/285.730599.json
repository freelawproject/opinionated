The defendant put in no defense. The trial judge charged the jury: \u201cYour are considering the claim of a passenger in a motor bus of the Public Service Transportation Company, suffered by that passenger while riding upon the bus, on the theory that there was negligence on part of the company, through its agents in the operation of the bus and so of the care of the passengers. The evidence on the subject is uncontradicted, and the court charges you that the plaintiff is entitled to a verdict for such damages as you find from the evidence he has suffered by reason of this accident, so the court will not go further into the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">There was an exception taken to the charge as follows: \u201cI will except to that part of the charge wherein the court said the plaintiff was entitled to a verdict for such damages as he suffered by reason of the accident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">It is to be observed that the exception is taken only to that part of the charg\u00e9 which related to the question of damages and not to&gt; what the court said on the subject of negligence. No other part of the court\u2019s charge was excepted to. It is quite clear that there is no error in the instruction to the jury that the plaintiff was entitled to a verdict for such damages as he suffered by reason of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">It is argued in the appellant\u2019s brief that the judge erred in that part of the charge where he said: \u201cYou are considering the claim of a passenger in a motor bus of the Public Service Transportation Company, suffered by that passenger while riding upon the bus on the theory that there was negligence on the part of the company through its agents, in the opera<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>tion of the bus. The evidence on the subject is uncontradicted and the court charges you that the plaintiff is entitled to a verdict.\u201d * * * But to this part of the court\u2019s charge no exception was taken and, therefore, the legal proposition involved is not properly before us. But even if the matter were before us for decision, we think, as the case stood, with the facts uncontroverted it fell squarely within the legal rule enunciated in <em>Doyon </em>v. <em>Massoline Motor Car Co., </em>98 <em>N. J. L. </em>510 (at <em>p. </em>543), where our Court of Errors and Appeals said: \u201cNo question for a jury arises where the facts are uneontroverted, unless from the facts conflicting inference may be drawn.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\">Surely, the uncontradicted facts in the present case do not permit conflicting inferences to be drawn, but, on the contrary, unerringly point to negligent conduct on part of the defendant\u2019s servants.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">Judgment is affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
