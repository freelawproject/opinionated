This, we think, is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-5\">The next reason urged'is that the verdict is excessive. The case shows that the plaintiff, while not bruised or hurt, was made ill from nervousness resulting from the assault upon her, and consulted a doctor twice, and that in the assault her night dress was torn.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-6\">If the jury believed her testimony they were warranted in awarding punitive damages, and with that purpose in view we cannot say from the amount awarded that they were influenced by passion or prejudice, which is the determining factor in such cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-7\">We think the rule should be discharged.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
