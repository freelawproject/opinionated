HANS JOHNSON, DEFENDANT.</parties>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b681-4\">Decided June 17, 1927.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b681-7\">Before Justices Kalisch, Katzenbacii and Lloyd.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b681-8\">For the rale, <em>Freeman Woodbridge.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b681-9\">\n<em>Contra.

Nor would the trial judge have been warranted to nonsuit the plaintiff on the ground of contributory negligence. The burden of establishing that the plaintiff\u2019s negligence proximately contributing to his injury was upon the defendant. Under the testimony in the present case it was a disputed question of fact, pre-eminently, for a jury to decide. Nor can we say that the verdict is so contrary to the weight of the evidence as to shock the sense of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">The point that the verdict is excessive is abandoned in defendant\u2019s brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">The rule to show cause is discharged, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
