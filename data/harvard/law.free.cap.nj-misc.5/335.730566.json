The only reason advanced for a refusal to issue a permit is the ordinance of March 15th, 1921, which divides the township into two districts, one of which is a residential district, the premises involved being in that district in which the erection of buildings to he used as stores is prohibited. This is not a legal excuse under the many eases decided by onr courts, such as <em>Ignaciunas </em>v. <em>Risley, </em>98 <em>N. J. L. </em>712; <em>affirmed, </em>99 <em>Id. </em>389. A peremptory writ of <em>mandamus </em>is directed to issue in this case. The relator is entited to costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
