The application was first made to the trial judge, who denied it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-12\">The reasons advanced were (1) that the verdicts are excessive, and (2) that they are against the weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-13\">With respect to the latter reason it is sufficient to say that a careful consideration of the evidence shows that the verdicts are not against the weight of the evidence; that on the contrary they are plainly supported by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-14\">Now, with respect to the contention that the verdicts are excessive, the evidence makes it quite plain that the verdict in favor of the infant plaintiff for $1,000 and that in favor of the mother of the boy for $500 are not excessive, but on the contrary are moderate in amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-15\">The rule applied for is denied, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
