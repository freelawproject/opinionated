He applied for a permit to the building inspector for leave to erect a four-story brick apartment-house upon this tract. The building inspector refused to issue the permit solely because the zoning ordinance of the municipality fore-bade the erection of apartment-houses of the kind proposed in that zone, which is designated in the ordinance as a \u201cSmall Volume Residence District.\u201d The case is controlled by the decision of the Court of Errors and Appeals in the case of <em>State </em>v. Nutley, 99 <em>N. J. L. </em>389.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-12\">A peremptory writ will be ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
