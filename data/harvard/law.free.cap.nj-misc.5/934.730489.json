The trial court excluded testimony tending to fasten this condition upon the agreement, and this ruling presents the substantial basis of the defendant\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-4\">In <em>Freeman </em>v. <em>Van Wagener, </em>90 <em>N. J. L. </em>358, an attempt to make a similar agreement applicable only if the property was sold to a certain buyer, and this court held such an attempt to be within the parol evidence rule. Here, the contention is that the agreement was to become applicable only if a certain sale in negotiation would not be consummated. We think the same rule of exclusion is equally applicable, and that the trial court was correct in so holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-5\">The judgment will be aifirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
