There is nothing before us upon which we can pass upon this question other than the state of the case which sets forth that this was the amount of damage established.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-15\">Point three is that although the judge was present the clerk of the court received the verdict. We are unable to see anything irregular or harmful in this.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>Point five is that the clerk refused to poll the jury. There is nothing before us showing that a request to poll was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-4\">Point six is there was no evidence of actual damage. This has 'already been disposed of under points one, two and four. The judgment under 'review is affirmed, with costs. '</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
