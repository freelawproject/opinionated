When appellee started to cross the street the automobile was one-half a block from her, and when she had reached within a few feet from the opposite curb, toward which she was walking, she was struck and injured. The only grounds of appeal are error in refusing to nonsuit and direct a verdict in favor of defendant below because there was no evidence of negligence and because of the contributory negligence of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-14\">There was evidence to sustain the trial judge\u2019s findings upon both these points, and, therefore, we will not disturb his findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-15\">The judgment below will be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
