Clark &amp; Son, Inc. The trial resulted in a verdict in his favor and against that defendant. The other defendant, who was the owner of the steamship' upon which the accident happened, was exonerated by the jury. The plaintiff\u2019s damages were assessed at $3,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-12\">The only question argued before us on this rule is the alleged excessiveness of the verdict. Our examination of the testimony leads us to the conclusion that the award of the jury is not so plainly excessive as to justify our setting it aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-13\">The rule to show cause will be discharged.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
