The accident happened after night fall. Action was brought against defendant and upon a trial thereof at the Union Circuit the infant plaintiff obtained a verdict of $5,000 and his father a verdict of $2,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-13\">Three reasons are urged why these verdicts should be set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>1. Error in refusing to direct a verdict for the defendant because Springfield avenue had been closed to traffic by the board of chosen freeholders of Union county, and, therefore, the infant plaintiff was a trespasser, or, at best, a mere licensee, and there was no evidence of willful wg:ong-doing.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\"><em>2. </em>Refusal to charge requests 3, 4, <em>5 </em>and <em>7 </em>of defendant, and error in -charging plaintiffs\u2019 request No. 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">Our examination and consideration of the proofs and these reasons brings us to the conclusion that the verdicts should not be disturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">In some respects this case is not unlike that of <em>Sadlon </em>v. Jannarone, 132 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>749.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">The rule to show cause is discharged, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
