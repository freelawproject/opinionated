We think the rights of the prosecutor will be fully protected if the respondent highway commission is permitted to proceed with its work of filling in and constructing the embankment upon which the roadway is proposed to be constructed, but that all other and further work and construction be stayed until the further order of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-13\">An order for a stay, so limited, may be taken and entered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
