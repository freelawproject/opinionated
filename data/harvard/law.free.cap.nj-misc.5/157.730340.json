The tank exploded in the defendant\u2019s garage while being repaired.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-13\">The defendant writes down eight reasons for a new trial, which are argued in the brief under two heads, viz., the infant plaintiff, Stephen W. Swenty, stood in a place of danger,</p>\n<p id=\"AiF\">going beyond the bounds of his invitation, and the damages awarded by the jury are excessive. These were questions of fact properly submitted to the jury under the evidence. We see no reason for disturbing the verdicts. The rule to show cause is therefore discharged.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
