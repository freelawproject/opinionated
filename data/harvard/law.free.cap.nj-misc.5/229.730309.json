As part of the arrangement a bond was given by the defendant to the plaintiff and the other creditors, the latter of whom assigned their interest to the plaintiff before this action was brought.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">The bond contained several provisions as conditions precedent to any liability thereunder, as follows: (1) That creditors refrain from applying for a receivership, and that a creditors\u2019 committee be appointed; (3) that $11,000 due on mortgage be paid to Camarata; (3) that creditors shall not be paid in full their claims at windup of Troy Realty Company\u2019s affairs. The three above conditions were fulfilled.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">The obligation or penalty of the bond was that the defendant pay a sufficient amount (not exceeding $5,000) \u201cto make the percentage of loss, if any, sustained by the parties of the second part (the creditors) no greater than if the said party of the first part had not received the sum of $11,000 on the mortgage hereinabove mentioned, but had shared equally its proportionate loss together with the parties of the second part.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">The defendant contends that there was error in the court\u2019s refusal to grant its motion for a directed verdict and in granting a like motion in plaintiff\u2019s behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-9\">To this we deem it to be a sufficient answer to say that this contention is unsound, and that under the undisputed facts the verdict was properly directed for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-10\">We find no error in the admission of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-11\">The judgments below will be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
