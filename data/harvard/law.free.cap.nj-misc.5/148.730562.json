L. </em>1911, <em>p. </em>376, \u00a7 15, as amended by <em>Pamph. L. </em>1921, <em>p. </em>390. We think this question must he answered in the affirmative under the authority of <em>Acquackanonk Water Co. </em>v. <em>Board of Public Utility Commissioners, </em>97 <em>N. J. L. </em>366; <em>affirmed, </em>98 <em>Id. </em>449, under the title of the East Jersey Water Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>The brief of the prosecutors is largely if not exclusively devoted to an attempt to demonstrate that this case is not controlled by the cited cases, pointing out what seems to be to the prosecutors important differences and distinctions. It would serve no useful purpose to pursue this subject further in detail, as we are satisfied that those cases are controlling; hence, the judgment of the board of public utility commissioners sought to be reviewed is affirmed, and the writ of <em>certiorari </em>is dismissed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
