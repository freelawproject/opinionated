The trial resulted in a verdict in favor of the father for $1,050, and against the daughter and in favor of the defendant company as to her claim. The defendant seeks to have a verdict set aside so far as it awarded damages to the father and the plaintiffs seek to have it set aside so far as it denied compensation to the daughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-12\">In view of the fact that both the plaintiffs and defendant concur in the view that the verdict as a whole is erroneous, and because it is manifestly self-contradictory, the rules to show cause will each of them be made absolute.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
