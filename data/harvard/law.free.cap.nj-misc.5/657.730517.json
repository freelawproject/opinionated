There are no assignments of errors nor specifications of causes for reversal. If it was intended to have the case reviewed on strict writ of error, on bills of exceptions, or simply on defects in the record, the printed cause should have disclosed assignments of errors specifying the particular errors relied on for a reversal of the judgment. If it was intended to have .the conviction reviewed under the one hundred and thirty-sixth section of the Criminal Procedure act, then it is essential that it should appear by a certificate of the trial judge that the proceedings transmitted by him comprise the entire record of the proceedings had upon the trial. Furthermore, there must also be a specification of cause for reversal, which should point out with particularity the error relied on for a reversal. The printed case before us contains neither a certificate of the trial judge as above stated, nor any assignment of errors, nor any specification of causes for reversal. '</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">The writ is dismissed and judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
