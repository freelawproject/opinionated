The trial of the cause resulted in his conviction, and he thereupon sued out the present writ of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1011\">*1011</page-number>The first ground for reversa] specified in the reasons filed is that the trial court, having permitted \u201ccounsel for the defendant to be forcibly thrown into his chair and mistreated and abused in the presence of the jury, to the prejudice of the defendant,\u201d then refused to withdraw a juror and declare a mistrial, upon the application of the defendant\u2019s counsel, based his alleged forcible seating. An examination of the state of the case bearing upon this matter disclosed the following situation: A Mrs. Hubert was being examined on behalf of the state, and testified that her husband frequented the defendant\u2019s place, and that he frequently came home drunk. She was then asked if she knew where he got the liquor, to which she answered, \u201cYes.\u201d Then followed this question: \u201cHow do you know?\u201d Counsel for defendant objected to the question, and the court overruled the objection, allowing counsel an exception to the ruling. The question was then repeated, and the witness answered: \u201cWhy, my son has often went there with his father, and his father has went in sober and come out drunk.\u201d Counsel for defendant then said, \u201cJust a moment.\u201d Apparently he was on his feet when he said it, for the court said in reply: \u201cShe is telling how she knows: she may do it. Sit down.\u201d Counsel replied, \u201cI want to register my complaint.\u201d The court again said, \u201cSit down;\u201d to which counsel replied, \u201cI have the right\u201dThe court then said, \u201cMr. Beddows, will you put him down ?\u201d Counsel, disregarding the order of the court, then proceeded, saying, \u201cI have the right to register my objection.\u201d This, as we have stated, he had already done, and an exception had been allowed to him to the court\u2019s ruling upon it. \u201cThereupon,\u201d to recite from the state of the case, \u201cMr. Beddows, a court officer, placed Mr. Ely in his chair by the counsel table.\u201d It is apparent from this recital that the ground for reversal above specified is based upon alleged facts that have no existence; namely, that \u201ccounsel for defendant was forcibly thrown into his chair and mistreated and abused.\u201d The trouble seems to have been that counsel considered that he was superior to the court in the determination of the methods to be pursued by him in the trial of the cause, and that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1012\">*1012</page-number>court disagreed with him and undertook to demonstrate the unsoundness of counsel\u2019s position. The method adopted by the court seems to us not legally objectionable under the circumstances, and, if the occurrence prejudiced the defendant in his trial on the merits, his counsel alone is responsible for that result. We conclude, therefore, that the motion to discharged juror and direct a mistrial was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-4\">The only other grounds upon which a reversal is asked are that the court refused to direct an acquittal of the defendant at the close of the state\u2019s case, and again at the close of the entire case. The sole basis upon which these motions were rested was that there was no evidence that would support the charge made in the indictment. Our examination of the proofs satisfies us that the contrary was the fact, and that the motions were properly refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-5\">The judgment under review will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
