The court directed a verdict for the defendants on the second count \u2014 receiving stolen goods. It is now urged for a reversal that the trial court erred in refusing to grant the motion to direct a verdict on the third count \u2014 for false pretenses. Let this be as it may, it will not cause a reversal for the conviction on the first count of grand larc\u00e9ny, as that count is not attacked. That count is sufficient to support the judgment. State v. <em>Huggins, </em>84 <em>N. J. L. </em>254; <em>State </em>v. <em>Rommel, </em>3 <em>N. J. Mis. R. </em>204; <em>affirmed, </em>3 <em>N. J. Adv. R. </em>1401.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-13\">The judgment of the Essex Court of Quarter Sessions is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
