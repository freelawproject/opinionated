They were tried together. The trial resulted in verdicts for the plaintiffs, as follows: Julius Archer Cohn, six cents; Max Polisky, $662.35; Clara Polisky, his wife, $250. A rule to show cause why a new trial should not be granted upon the question of damages only, was allowed the plaintiffs, on the ground that the damages awarded by the jury are insufficient and inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-13\">Our reading of the briefs and the transcript of the evidence taken at the trial lead us to the conclusion that the damages awarded by the-jury to the plaintiffs are inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-14\">The rule is therefore made absolute as to damages only, and the new trial will be confined to the 'question of damages.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
