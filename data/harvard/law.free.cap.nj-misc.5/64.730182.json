The legal rule is settled that \"if the property is otherwise sufficiently indentified, or casting out what is false in the description, there is still enough left to clearly point out the place where the property is, a misdescription as to location will not avoid the policy.\u201d 26 <em>Corp. Jur. </em>164, \u00a7 203, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>The legal correctness of part of the charge is made the basis of the next point. The defendant sets up as separate defense \u2014 (1) breach of warranty; (2) material misrepresentation; (3) fraudulent representation; all being directed to the description, use and location of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">What was charged by the court in relation to alleged fraudulent representations is criticised as not being correct in connection with the defense of breach of warranty. \u2022 The defendant submitted various requests fully covering these three defenses, all of which are fully charged by the court. The contention, therefore, is manifestly without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">It is finally urged that the verdict is against the weight of the evidence, on the question whether the structure containing the insured goods was a dwelling or a combined dwelling and dance hall. This contention, obviously, is disposed of by what has been stated with reference to the previous contentions supplemented by the fact that the defendant offered no witnesses in support of the contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">The rule will be discharged.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
