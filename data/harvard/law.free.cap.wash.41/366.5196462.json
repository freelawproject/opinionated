A jury was empanelled and sworn to fix the value of the property to be thus taken by the city. Kumerous witnesses gave evidence as to the value of the parcel sought to be appropriated. These witnesses testified as to the location, character, surroundings, accessibility, desirability, and disadvantages of said strip of real estate, and each gave his estimate as to its reasonable value. The lowest estimate of value placed upon the property by any witness was $400, and several of them fixed the amount in many times this sum. The jury, by consent of the parties, viewed the premises and, having heard all of the evidence, returned a verdict wherein they fixed the value of said property at $300. The appellants moved for a new trial upon the ground that the jury erred in assessing the amount of the recovery in that it was too small, and that the verdict was not supported by the evidence, but that it was contrary thereto in that the -.amount of the recovery was grossly inadequate. This motion was overruled\u00bb by the trial court, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>judgment entered upon the verdict. An appeal is taken therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">It was urged by appellant that the amount of the verdict, $300, being less than the lowest estimate of value fixed by any witness, said verdict is unsupported and contrary to the evidence, and that for that reason the trial court should have granted a new trial. We do not third?: this necessarily follows. In a case of this kind the granting of a motion for a new trial is peculiarly within the discretion of the trial court. It was suggested by respondent that, inasmuch as the members of the jury themselves viewed the premises and doubtless used the information they thereby gathered, we cannot review their verdict for the reason that what they themselves learned by an inspection of the premises constituted evidence which we cannot have before us, and that we must therefore apply the rule which prevents an appellate court from reviewing questions of fact where all of the evidence is not brought up. We do not think the rule invoked should he applied to a matter of this kind. The jury is not permitted to view the premises for the purpose of gathering evidence, but for the purpose of better understanding the evidence which has been adduced before it regarding said premises. We will therefore review questions such as are presented here notwithsanding it appears that the premises were inspected by the WW-</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">Answering appellants\u2019 contention that there was no evidence to sustain a verdict for less than $400, we call attention to the fact that the placing of an amount upon this propferty by each of the witnesses as its value was merely the expressing of the opinion of such witness. If there were no evidence in the case except these expressions of opinions by the various witnesses, and no evidence or facts which could he deemed at variance therewith, we would doubtless feel that a case was presented wherein the trial court should have granted a new trial. But there was other evidence. One of the witnesses, although he had fixed the value- of the parcel of land <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>at a certain sum, nevertheless in speaking thereof, said it had \u201cvirtually none, in the ordinary way and sense of selling property.\u201d Each and all of these witnesses gave a description of this property, and stated numerous facts calculated to show its advantages and disadvantages, considerable evidence being given as to the selling price of other real estate in that part of the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">All of this evidence had to do with facts which the jury had a perfect right, and which it was their duty, to consider in arriving at their verdict. The facts thus established by this evidence evidently led the jury to reach an opinion in their own minds which was different from that of any of the witnesses. The evidence of these various witnesses as to the condition, qualification, environment, merits and demerits of this property, and as to the prices for which other property had sold in that neighborhood, viewed in the light of their own observations when they viewed the premises, induced the jury to fix the value of said premises in an amount lower than that estimated by any witness except the one who said it had \u201cvirtually none.\u201d As a matter of law, it was certainly the privilege of the jury to do this. Having done so, and the appellants having moved for a new trial, it then became the duty of the trial judge to ascertain whether or not there were any reasons for setting aside'such verdict. If he believed the verdict to be grossly inadequate, or that a fair legal trial was not had,_ he should have granted a new trial. Ho passion or prejudice, or facts from which it would necessarily be inferred, are charged; and this is not made a ground of the motion for a new trial. We cannot therefore presume that the jury was thus affected.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">To the contention that, in the light of all of the evidence, the verdict was so grossly inadequate as to make it an abuse of discretion for a trial judge to permit it to stand, we must say that it does not so appear. The case was tried by a resident judge of Seattle who may be reasonably presumed! <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>to have known, at least in a general way, of the situation, character and value of this property and perhaps not unacquainted with the witnesses. The latter were personally before bim. He beard their testimony and saw their appearance and conduct upon the stand. He could observe their manner of answering questions and giving testimony. All of these matters furnished the trial judge a much better opportunity to weigh the testimony than has a judge in an appellate court. In view of these facts, and especially in view of the fact that the amounts stated by the various witnesses were but the expression of opinion, and keeping in mind that there was much other evidence touching the character and condition of the property, we cannot say that the trial judge was guilty of an abuse of discretion in not granting the motion for a new trial. That courts should be slow to overturn verdicts rendered in proceedings of this kind, may be seen by an examination of the following authorities: 7 Ency.
