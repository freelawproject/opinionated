At trial, Ms. Wakeel testified as follows.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">Tiffany stated that, one day appellant approached her in her bedroom, touched her chest and vaginal area, and then touched her behind. As Tiffany was talking about this episode, she became visibly upset and teary-eyed and her voice was quivering.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">Megan stated that, one day as she was going downstairs and appellant was coming upstairs, appellant reached for her vaginal area as if he was going to pick her up, touched her vaginal area, and \u201ctouched her chest area.\u201d Megan then pinched him on the leg. The touching occurred over Megan\u2019s clothes. As Megan was recounting the events, she appeared \u201cvery angry.\u201d Megan also stated that appellant hit her a lot on the face and on the arms; that she was not close to appellant; and that she knew him because he was staying at her babysitter\u2019s house.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-9\">Raven stated that, one day when she was watching television, appellant came in and sat down on the bed with her and pulled her so that she was seated between his legs. As she was sitting there, \u201che put his arms around her and placed his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>hands in her vaginal area and rubbed his private area against her buttocks.\u201d The touching occurred over Raven\u2019s clothes.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\">Tiffany\u2019s mother testified that in January, 2002, Tiffany, Megan and Raven told her something had happened with appellant. She called appellant and asked him to come home from work. When he arrived, she and Tiffany confronted him, but he denied their accusations. The mother of Megan and Raven threatened to call the police, and appellant left.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">Appellant testified that he did not have any sexual contact with any of the children. He cooperated with the police, at whose suggestion he wrote a letter of apology to the children, explaining that he had never intended to touch them improperly. As stated above, appellant was convicted of six counts of third degree sexual offense and one count of child abuse.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"Aye\">I &amp; II</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">The Confrontation Clause guarantees the right of a criminal defendant to \u201cbe confronted with witnesses against him.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. VI.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> \u201cThe primary interest se<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>cured by the confrontation clause is the right of cross-examination.\u201d <em>Crawford v. State, </em>282 Md. 210, 214, 383 A.2d 1097 (1978); <em>Douglas v. Alabama, </em>380 U.S. 415, 418, 85 S.Ct. 1074, 13 L.Ed.2d 934 (1965). In 1980, the United States Supreme Court stated that the introduction of a hearsay declaration will not violate a criminal defendant\u2019s right of confrontation if the declaration is either (1) a \u201cfirmly rooted\u201d exception to the rule against hearsay,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> or (2) bears \u201cparticularized guarantees of trustworthiness.\u201d <em>Ohio v. Roberts, </em>448 U.S. 56, 62-66, 100 S.Ct. 2531, 65 L.Ed.2d 597 (1980) (citing <em>Mattox v. United States, </em>156 U.S. 237, 243, 15 S.Ct. 337, 39 L.Ed. 409 (1895)).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">Both <em>Crawford v. State </em>and <em>Ohio v. Roberts </em>presented the question of whether the Confrontation Clause required that the trial judge exclude preliminary hearing testimony that had been given by a witness who was unavailable to testify at trial. In <em>Crawford, </em>the Court of Appeals held that the preliminary hearing testimony was admissible because the appellant \u201chad a full opportunity\u201d to cross examine the witness during the preliminary hearing. 282 Md. at 222, 383 A.2d 1097. Although the United States Supreme Court could have taken that very same approach in <em>Roberts </em>(because the witness who was unavailable at trial had been called to the stand by defense counsel during the preliminary hearing), the <em>Roberts </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>Court held that the preliminary hearing testimony was admissible under the \u201cparticularized guarantees of trustworthiness\u201d standard. 448 U.S. at 66, 100 S.Ct. 2531. CP 11-304 represents a legislative response to <em>Roberts.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">Recognizing that the \u201cconfrontation\u201d issue arises if the child does not testify, CP 11-304 expressly conditions the admissibility of the statements on a showing that the statements contain \u201cparticularized guarantees of trustworthiness.\u201d <em>See </em>(e)(1). In making this determination, a court must evaluate thirteen separate factors,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and \u201cmake a finding on the record as to the specific guarantees of trustworthiness that are in the statement.\u201d <em>See </em>(f). Before making this finding, the court must examine the child, either in chambers, the courtroom, or another suitable location where the public is not in attendance. <em>See </em>(g)(1). In the case at bar, the circuit court complied with all of the statutory preconditions for admitting the children\u2019s hearsay statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">CP 11-304 is the most recent version of the tender years statute that originally appeared in Md.Code Ann., Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings (C.J.) \u00a7 9-103.1.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Under C.J. \u00a7 9-103.1, which was enacted in 1988, an out of court statement made by an alleged child victim was admissible \u201cif the child [was] subject to cross-examination about the out of court statement and testifie[d]: (i) at the criminal proceeding; or (ii) by closed-circuit television.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 48 &amp; n. 187 (quoting former C.J. \u00a7 9-103.1(c)(1)). The statement was also admissible if the child was unavailable to testify due to (1) death, (2) absence from the jurisdiction, (3) serious physical disability, or (4) inability to communicate about the alleged offense due to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>serious emotional distress. <em>Id. </em>at 48 <em>&amp; </em>n. 188 (citing former C.J. \u00a7 9-103.1(c)(l)(i)).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> When the child declarant was unavailable to testify, the statute conditioned admissibility of the statements on the existence of corroborative evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 47 &amp; n. 181 (citing C.J. \u00a7 9-103.1(c)(2)(iii)). In 1994, the legislature amended C.J. \u00a7 9-103.1 to allow the use of the tender years exception regardless of whether the child is available to testify. Whether that amendment was consistent with <em>Ohio v. Roberts </em>is now a moot question.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">On March 8, 2004, in <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S.-, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004), the United States Supreme Court held that the Confrontation Clause bars the introduction of a \u201ctestimonial\u201d hearsay statement unless (1) the hearsay declarant is unavailable, and (2) the defendant had a prior opportunity to cross examine the declarant. <em>Id. </em>at 1374. In that case,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> which we must apply to the \u201cconfrontation\u201d issue presented in the case at bar,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Crawford\u2019s conviction was reversed on the ground that the introduction of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>wife\u2019s hearsay statement to police officers violated his right of confrontation.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The trial court had admitted the statement on the ground that the statement contained \u201cparticularized guarantees of trustworthiness.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The jury found Crawford guilty of assault. <em>Id. </em>Using a nine-factor test, the Washington Court of Appeals reversed, concluding that the statement was not trustworthy. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>21</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The Supreme Court of Washington reinstated the conviction, holding that the statement <em>did </em>contain particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">The United States Supreme Court <em>(Crawford </em>Court) traced the criminal defendant\u2019s right of confrontation to English common law,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> <em>id. </em>at 1360 (citations omitted), noting that many <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>of the American Colonies (including Maryland) adopted Declarations of Rights that expressly included the right of confrontation. <em>Id. </em>at 1362. The First Congress included the Confrontation Clause in the proposal that became the Sixth Amendment.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">The <em>Crawford </em>Court concluded that, because \u201cthe principal evil at which the Confrontation Clause was directed was ... use of <em>ex parte </em>examinations as evidence against the accused,\u201d the Confrontation Clause applies to some out of court statements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-5\">An off-hand, over-heard remark might be unreliable evidence and thus a good candidate for exclusion under hearsay rules, but it bears little resemblance to the civil-law abuses the Confrontation Clause targeted. On the other hand, <em>ex parte </em>examinations might sometimes be admissible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>under modern hearsay rules, but the Framers certainly would not have condoned them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b177-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 1364.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\"><em>Crawford </em>draws a distinction between two different kinds of out-of-court statements, those that are \u201ctestimonial\u201d and those that are not.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Because the Confrontation Clause applies to \u201ctestimony\u201d against the accused, the introduction of testimonial statements offends the Confrontation Clause. <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The <em>Crawford </em>Court rejected the proposition that an unsworn statement was not \u201ctestimonial,\u201d and expressly held that interrogations by law enforcement officers are included within the class of \u201ctestimonial\u201d hearsay,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> as are \u201cprior testimony at a preliminary hearing, before a grand jury, or at a former trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1364-65, 1374.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>The <em>Crawford </em>Court ultimately concluded that \u201cthe Framers would not have allowed admission of testimonial statements of a witness who did not appear at trial unless the witness was unavailable to testify, and the defendant had had a prior opportunity for cross-examination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1365. The <em>Crawford </em>Court explained that (1) while there have always been exceptions to the rule against hearsay, there is \u201cscant evidence that exceptions were invoked to admit <em>testimonial </em>statements against the accused in a <em>criminal </em>case,\u201d and (2) exceptions such as business records and statements made in furtherance of a conspiracy are not \u201ctestimonial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1367. (citation omitted) (footnote omitted).<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">When the admissibility of nontestimonial hearsay is at issue, the individual states are entitled to determine what statements should be admitted and what statements should be excluded,<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> but when \u201ctestimonial evidence is at issue .. ., the Sixth Amendment demands what the common law required: una<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>vailability and a prior opportunity for cross examination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1374.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\"> We are persuaded that the statements testified to by Ms. Wakeel at trial were \u201ctestimonial.\u201d As the trial court stated: \u201cThe children were interviewed for the expressed purpose of developing their testimony by Ms. Wakeel, under the relevant Maryland statute that provides for the testimony of certain persons in lieu of a child, in a child sexual abuse case....\u201d In light of Crawford,<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> appellant is entitled to a new trial at which the State will be prohibited from introducing any testimonial hearsay declarations of a person who (1) is available to testify,<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> or (2) made the testimonial hearsay statements on an occasion at which the defendant did not have an opportunity for cross-examination.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">The Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution provides that no person shall \u201cbe subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy.\u201d <em>Lockhart v. Nelson, </em>488 U.S. 33, 38, 109 S.Ct. 285, 102 L.Ed.2d 265 (1988); <em>State v. Griffiths, </em>338 Md. 485, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>489, 659 A.2d 876 (1995).<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Likewise, under Maryland\u2019s common law of double jeopardy,<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> a defendant cannot be \u201cput in jeopardy again for the same offense\u2014in jeopardy of being convicted of a crime for which he had been acquitted; in jeopardy of being twice convicted and punished for the same crime.\u201d <em>Gianiny v. State, </em>320 Md. 337, 347, 577 A.2d 795 (1990). We disagree with appellant\u2019s assertion that there was insufficient evidence before the trial court to prove that (1) appellant touched the complainants\u2019 for the purpose of sexual arousal, and (2) appellant committed six counts of third degree sexual offense.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">The court relied upon the following evidence when it found appellant guilty of child abuse and the related offenses:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-5\">The children were interviewed for the expressed purpose of developing their testimony by Ms. Wakeel, under the relevant Maryland statute that provides for the testimony of certain persons in lieu of a child, in a child sexual abuse case in court earlier on a\u2014well, it was in the context of the trial, but technically it\u2019s a pretrial motion\u2014did accept, after interviewing the children, did accept the testimony of Ms. Wak-eel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>Accordingly, the Court does believe that the children were of the belief that they were improperly touched, whether they knew it or not, in violation of Maryland law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-4\">The police officer who was assigned the investigation did arrest the Defendant, did conduct an interview with the Defendant, an interrogation if you will. The Defendant, at the conclusion of that session, did agree, after having signed an advice of rights form, did make certain voluntary admissions in the form of what can only be described as two abortive efforts at a letter of apology and one more complete letter of apology. It is the Court\u2019s specific finding that these statements from the Defendant were voluntary in nature; that they were not coerced or induced by an illegitimate means such as a promise of some type, or the like.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-5\">I conclude, frankly from these letters, that the Defendant was hopeful that if it was sincerely accepted by the young girls and probably as importantly by their mothers, that the charges would not be pursued and that he would not have to face the circumstances of which he finds himself involved today.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-6\">The most revealing, obviously, is the last letter in which it says: \u201cGirls, I\u2019m very sorry that this happen. It was a accident. You girls are always playing with me and accidents do happen.

The <em>Crawford </em>Court concluded that, because the introduction of statements found to be reliable by the trial judges is \u201cfundamentally at odds with the right of confrontation,\u201d multiple-factor tests for reliability are, ironically, unreliable. <em>Id. </em>at 1370. Providing examples in support of its conclusion that the <em>Roberts </em>test is too \"malleable,\" the <em>Crawford </em>Court explained that the <em>Roberts </em>test is both (1) excessively broad because \u201cit applies the same mode of analysis whether or not the hearsay consists of <em>e.x parte </em>testimony;\u201d and (2) overly narrow because \"fit] admits statements that <em>do </em>consist of <em>ex parte </em>testimony upon a mere finding of reliability.\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>at 1369-70.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b179-9\">. Because the State did not establish that the children were unavailable to testify, hearsay statements admitted in the case at bar did not satisfy either of the <em>Crawford </em>foundational requirements.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b179-10\">. Although the ultimate goal of the Confrontation Clause is to ensure that evidence is reliable, the defendant's prior opportunity for cross-examination is now a \"necessary\u201d precondition for the introduction of a testimonial statement made by a person who is unavailable to testify at trial. <em>Id. </em>at 1370-71.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b180-6\">. The Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment was made applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>Benton v.

Although the Maryland Constitution contains no express double jeopardy provision, such a protection exists under Maryland common law. <em>Ware v.

The crime of third degree sexual assault is codified as Md.Code Ann., Crim Law \u00a7 3-307 (2003). The statute prohibits sexual contact with a person under the age of fourteen when \"the person performing the sexual contact is at least 4 years older than the victim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at (a)(3). Sexual contact is described as the \"intentional touching of any part of the victim\u2019s or actor's anal or genital areas or other intimate parts for the purposes of sexual arousal or gratification or for abuse of either party.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at (f)(1). \"It does not include acts commonly expressive of familial or friendly affection, or acts for accepted medical purposes.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"36\">\n<p id=\"b182-7\">. The standard for our review of the sufficiency of the evidence is \"whether after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Bloodsworth v. State, </em>307 Md. 164, 167, 512 A.2d 1056 (1986) (citing <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 313, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979)). When, as in appellant\u2019s situation, a case is tried without a jury, this Court is required to \"review the case on both the law and the evidence.\" Md. Rule 8\u2014131 (c); <em>Elias v.
