Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>344 Md. 70, 684 A.2d 1338 (1996). In this appeal, we must determine whether a firefighter\u2019s surviving, dependent spouse is similarly entitled to collect both service related pension benefits and workers\u2019 compensation benefits when the firefighter\u2019s death results from an occupational disease. Resolution of the case requires us to construe several provisions of the Labor and Employment Article (\u201cL.E.\u201d) of the Maryland Code (1991, 1999 Repl.Vol., 2003 Supp.).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\">Ernest Johnson, appellee,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> a Baltimore City fireman, died from colon cancer, a compensable occupational disease under L.E. \u00a7 9-503(c). Mr. Johnson\u2019s widow, Jesse Johnson, collects his service pension benefits. Because of Mr. Johnson\u2019s status as a public safety employee, Mrs. Johnson claims that, pursuant to L.E. \u00a7 9-503(e), she is also entitled to collect workers\u2019 compensation benefits, so long as the total amount does not exceed Mr. Johnson\u2019s average weekly wage at the time of his death. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission (the \u201cCommission\u201d) agreed with Mrs. Johnson.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">Thereafter, the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore (the \u201cCity\u201d or the \u201cEmployer\u201d), appellant, appealed to the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. Relying on L.E. \u00a7 9-610, the City claimed that its payment of the pension benefits, in a sum greater than the compensation benefits, satisfied the City\u2019s obligation with regard to payment of workers\u2019 compensation benefits. The circuit court disagreed. This appeal followed, in which the City asks:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-6\">Did the lower court err in ruling that the offset provision in [L.E.] \u00a7 9-503(e) applies to the receipt of benefits by the surviving dependents of a deceased firefighter?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-7\">For the reasons that follow, we shall reverse and remand.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b596-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>\n<em>FACTUAL SUMMARY</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">Mr. Johnson worked as a Baltimore City firefighter for thirty-two years. In connection with his duties, he was routinely exposed to heat, smoke, noxious fumes, and toxic substances. In January 1993, while still employed as a fireman, Mr. Johnson was diagnosed with colon cancer. He succumbed to that illness on March 11, 1994. At the time of his death, Mr. Johnson earned an average weekly wage of $989.75. The parties agree that Mrs. Johnson was wholly dependent upon her husband, and that Mr. Johnson\u2019s cancer constituted an occupational disease under L.E. \u00a7 9-503(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">As a result of Mr. Johnson\u2019s death, his widow received a service pension benefit of $603.90 per week from the City\u2019s pension system. <em>See </em>Baltimore City Code (2003), Art. 22, \u00a7 34(h). On February 13,1998, Mrs. Johnson filed a Workers\u2019 Compensation claim,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which the City initially contested. At a hearing held by the Commission on December 10, 2002, Mrs. Johnson was the only witness. She testified that her husband joined the Fire Department in September 1961; in January 1993, while Mr. Johnson was still employed with the Fire Department, he was diagnosed with colon cancer; and he died from that illness on March 11,1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">Appellee introduced in evidence a letter from Dr. Stephen Glasser, a doctor of internal medicine, oncology, and hematology, who reviewed Mr. Johnson\u2019s medical records in 2002. Dr. Glasser opined that, to \u201ca reasonable degree of medical probability ... Mr. Johnson\u2019s malignancy was directly related to his [lengthy] occupational exposure ... to the carcinogenic products of fire particularly during the earlier years of inadequate protection.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b597-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>In an Order dated December 24, 2002, the Commission found that the claimant died from an occupational disease arising out of and in the course of employment. Further, it ruled that Mrs. Johnson, the \u201cspouse of the deceased employee, was totally dependent\u201d upon Mr. Johnson at the time of his death. It also determined that Mrs. Johnson receives $603.90 per week from the City\u2019s pension system, and that Mr. Johnson earned an average weekly wage of $989.75 when he died. However, it deferred ruling on the issue of \u201cwhat set off provision applies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">Thereafter, the City asked the Commission to address the question of the set off. In an Order dated January 31, 2003, the Commission determined \u201cthat the appropriate set off provision in this case is [L.E. \u00a7 ] 9-503(e).\u201d In all other respects, the Commission affirmed its Order of December 24, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">The City subsequently appealed to the circuit court, where the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment that were heard on June 30, 2003. The circuit court filed a Memorandum and Opinion on July 3, 2003, in which it granted appellee\u2019s summary judgment motion and denied the City\u2019s summary judgment motion. It also issued two orders, both dated July 2, 2003; one denied the City\u2019s motion and the other granted appellee\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">In its opinion, the circuit court rejected the City\u2019s contention that the dependents of firefighters are subject to the offset provision generally applicable to government employees, found in L.E. \u00a7 9-610. In its view, the Employer\u2019s position was at odds with the purpose of L.E. \u00a7 9-503 and the Act. The court reasoned that, by enacting L.E. \u00a7 9-503, \u201cthe Legislature intended to recognize and grant special consideration to those government employees, such as firefighters, who are engaged in and subjected to hazardous work.\u201d Moreover, the court believed that \u201cthe Legislature intended that the special benefits provided to public safety employees pursuant to [L.E.] \u00a7 9-503 be enjoyed and used for the benefit of the employee\u2019s dependants as well.\u201d Because appellee was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>entitled under the Act to recover dual benefits while he was alive, the court deemed it \u201cinconsistent\u201d to award benefits to certain public service employees while alive and sick, and then terminate those benefits to the dependants when the public service employee dies from the very disease that was acquired during the course of the employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">The parties vigorously dispute whether Mrs. Johnson is entitled to receive a combination of both workers\u2019 compensation benefits and pension benefits. But, there is much about which they do agree. For example, they agree that colon cancer is a type of \u201crectal cancer\u201d within the scope of L.E. \u00a7 9-503(c), and that Mr. Johnson died from that occupational disease. Moreover, there is no dispute about appellee\u2019s average weekly wage, the rate of workers\u2019 compensation benefits, or the amount of pension benefits that Mrs. Johnson receives from the City. Nor does Mrs. Johnson contend that any recovery of combined benefits can exceed appellee\u2019s average weekly wage at the time of his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">To understand the parties\u2019 various contentions, which we discuss at length, <em>infra, </em>it is helpful to begin with a review of the relevant provisions of the Act.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ahz-dedup-0\">Section 9-501. Accidental personal injury.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-8\">(a) <em>In </em>general.\u2014Except as otherwise provided, each employer of a covered employee shall provide compensation in accordance with this title to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-9\">(1) the covered employee for an accidental personal injury sustained by the covered employee; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>(2) the dependants of the covered employee for death of the covered employee:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-4\">(i) resulting from an accidental personal injury sustained by the covered employee; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-5\">(ii) occurring within 7 years after the date of the accidental personal injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-6\">(b) <em>Employer liable regardless of </em>fault.\u2014An employer is liable to provide compensation in accordance with subsection (a) of this section, regardless of fault as to a cause of the accidental personal injury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">\u00a7 9-502.

In effect, it provides special treatment for certain public safety employees. In regard to firefighters, a person who is a paid firefighter or a volunteer firefighter covered under L.E. \u00a7 9-234, and who has a specified occupational disease, including rectal cancer, is legally presumed to have developed the disease in the line of duty. Under certain circumstances, \u00a7 9-503(e) permits a public safety employee simultaneously to collect workers\u2019 compensation benefits and retirement benefits, up to a maximum that does not exceed the worker\u2019s weekly wage. L.E. \u00a7 9-503 states, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-8\">\u00a7 9-503.

It states:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-8\">\u00a7 9-610. Offset against other benefits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-9\">(a) <em>Covered employee of governmental unit or quasi-public </em>corporation.\u2014(1) Except for benefits subject to an offset under \u00a7 29-118 of the State Personnel and Pensions Article, <em>if a statute, charter, ordinance, resolution, regulation, or policy, regardless of whether part of a pension system, provides a benefit to a covered employee of a governmental </em>unit or a quasi-public corporation that is subject to this title under \u00a7 9-201(2) of this title <em>or, in case of death, to the dependents of the covered employee, payment of the benefit by the employer satisfies, to the extent of the payment, the liability of the employer </em>and the Subsequent Injury Fund for payment of similar benefits under this title.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-10\">(2) If a benefit paid under paragraph (1) of this subsection is less than the benefits provided under this title, the employer, the Subsequent Injury Fund, or both shall provide an additional benefit that equals the difference between the benefit paid under paragraph (1) of this subsection and the benefits provided under this title.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>(3) The computation of an additional benefit payable under paragraph (2) of this section shall be done at the time of the initial award and may not include any cost of living adjustment after the initial award.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-4\">(c) <em>Poivers of </em>Commission.\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-5\">(1) The Commission may:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-6\">(i) determine whether any benefit provided by the employer is equal to or greater than any benefit provided for in this title; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-7\">(ii) make an award against the employer or the Subsequent Injury Fund or both to provide an additional benefit that equals the difference between the benefit provided by the employer and the benefits required by this title.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-8\">(2) A claim that comes under this section is subject to the continuing powers and jurisdiction of the Commission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b603-9\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-10\">L.E. \u00a7 9-681 pertains to workers\u2019 compensation death benefits. Pursuant to L.E. \u00a7 9-681, the death benefit is equal to two-thirds of the average weekly wage of the deceased covered employee. And, under L.E. \u00a7 9\u2014681(b), the amount of the benefit cannot exceed the State average weekly wage. L.E. \u00a7 9-681 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-11\">\u00a7 9-681. Wholly dependent individuals.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-12\">(a) <em>In general.\u2014If there are individuals who were wholly dependent on a deceased covered employee </em>at the time of death resulting from an accidental personal injury or occupational disease, <em>the employer or its insurer shall pay death benefits in accordance with this section.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-13\">(b) <em>Amount of death </em>benefit.\u2014(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, the death benefit payable under this section shall equal two-thirds of the average weekly wage of the deceased covered employee, but may not:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-14\">(i) exceed the State average weekly wage; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>(ii) be less than $25.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-5\">(2) If the average weekly wage of the deceased covered employee was less than $25 ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-6\">(c) <em>Duration of payment\u2014In </em>general.\u2014Except as otherwise provided in this section, the employer or its insurer shall pay the weekly death benefit:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-7\">(1) for the period of total dependency; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-8\">(2) until $45,000 has been paid.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-9\">(d) <em>Same\u2014Surviving spouse who remains wholly depen</em>dent.\u2014If a surviving spouse who was wholly dependent at the time of death continues to be wholly dependent after $45,000 has been paid, the employer or its insurer shall continue to make payments to the surviving spouse at the same weekly rate during the total dependency of the surviving spouse....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b604-10\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-11\">As we noted, Mr. Johnson had an average weekly wage of $989.75 at the time of his death; two-thirds of that amount equals $659.83. However, under L.E. \u00a7 9-681, because the State average weekly wage at the time of Mr. Johnson\u2019s death was $510, the workers\u2019 compensation death benefit is capped at $510. In light of the maximum workers\u2019 compensation death benefit of $510, and Mrs. Johnson\u2019s receipt of a weekly pension benefit from the City in the amount of $603.90, the City insists that its payment of the pension death benefit payment \u201ccompletely satisfies ... the City\u2019s liability for death benefits under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law.\u201d Consequently, it maintains that Mrs. Johnson \u201cis not entitled to any payment beyond the amount of the pension benefit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b604-12\">To support its position, the City relies on L.E. \u00a7 9-610, contending that it \u201capplies \u2018to <em>all </em>employees of governmental units and quasi-public corporations, including, presumably, firefighters.\u2019 \u201d (Citation omitted). Under L.E. \u00a7 9-610(a)(l), says the City, \u201ca government\u2019s payment of a death benefit to the surviving dependents of a deceased employee under a pension plan will offset part or all of the worker\u2019s compensation death benefit due to the surviving dependents.\u201d As Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>Johnson was an employee of a governmental unit, the City claims that the pension death benefit payable to Mrs. Johnson \u201cis subject to \u00a7 9~610(a).... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">According to the City, the \u201conly exception to \u00a7 9-610 is that provided in \u00a7 9-503,\u201d which applies to paid public safety employees who are actually alive and \u201creceiving benefits as a result of the effects of an occupational disease specified in \u00a7 9-503.\u201d The City concedes that, when appellee was alive, he was entitled to both compensation and pension benefits, pursuant to L.E. \u00a7 9~503(e), capped at his weekly wage. But, the City argues that the favorable treatment authorized by L.E. \u00a7 9-503(e) ends upon a worker\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">Observing that \u00a7 9-503 provides \u201cspecial, unique benefits to a specific group of employees,\u201d appellant maintains that only a <em>living </em>public safety employee is entitled to receive both workers\u2019 compensation benefits and pension payments. It reasons that L.E. \u00a7 9-503(e) constitutes an exception to general workers\u2019 compensation law, and insists that it \u201cshould not be judicially expanded beyond the extent clearly specified by the legislature, because it is in contradiction to the general legislative purpose in creating the offset provisions for governmental employers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">Appellant looks to the statutory text to support its argument. Noting the absence of any language in L.E. \u00a7 9-503 that extends the combined benefits to surviving dependents, the City claims that Mrs. Johnson is not entitled to recover dual payments. The City states: \u201cThe plain language of the statutory provisions makes it clear that \u00a7 9-503 does not allow the Appellee to receive dual benefits, even though Mr. Johnson could have done so prior to his death.\u201d Appellant adds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-8\">In the present case, there is no language in \u00a7 9-503 providing for the receipt of both pension and workers\u2019 compensation benefits, capped only by the amount of the deceased employee\u2019s weekly wage, by the surviving dependents of a deceased employee. The language of \u00a7 9-503 is clear and unambiguous. Therefore, there is no reason to go <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>beyond the clear language to determine the legislative intent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-5\">* Hi H:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-6\">Therefore, while retired public safety employees may simultaneously receive pension and workers\u2019 compensation benefits limited only by the amount of their weekly wage, their surviving dependents may not, because \u00a7 9-503 does not include an exception to the limitations imposed by \u00a7 9-610.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">Appellee presents equally cogent arguments, all to the contrary. Distilled to its essence, appellee contends that Mrs. Johnson\u2019s benefits \u201care subject to the cap in the public safety employee section, not the offset provision for government employees.\u201d Appellee relies on the principles of statutory construction and the salutary purpose of the Act to support the contention that L.E. \u00a7 9-503(e) applies to Mrs. Johnson.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-8\">According to appellee, the Legislature carved out certain professions involved in public safety, including firefighters, as deserving of special protection. In appellee\u2019s view, when \u201cthe Legislature carved out these exceptions for firefighters, it also carved out an exception to the general off-set provision for government employees,\u201d codified in \u00a7 9-503(e). In light of the Legislature\u2019s recognition of the increased risks to which firefighters are exposed, appellee argues that the statutory text of \u00a7 9-503(e) must be construed to permit firefighters <em>and </em>their surviving dependents to receive a combination of pension and workers\u2019 compensation benefits, not to exceed the firefighter\u2019s average weekly wage.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-9\">Appellee argues that the City\u2019s analysis is flawed because, under the City\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 9-503(e), \u201cfirefighters who die of the listed occupational diseases would be treated the same as any other government employee,\u201d and that view is at odds with the Legislature\u2019s intent. The City\u2019s position, says appellee, overlooks that \u201cthe Legislature intended the considerations granted to firefighters to extend beyond their death and for firefighters who suffer or die from the listed occupa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>tional diseases to be given more consideration than other government employees.\u201d Appellee explains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-4\">[T]his is because the firefighters were routinely exposed to risks of disability or death \u201cnot shared by other government employees.\u201d [ ] Given the background of the Act and subsection (e), it strains credibility to suggest that the Legislature intended for firefighters who suffer and ultimately dies [sic] from one of the listed occupational diseases to receive less consideration than firefighters who develop the condition and survive.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">(Footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">While appellee acknowledges that \u00a7 9-503(e) does not specifically \u201creference the dependents of the firefighters\u201d who die from covered diseases, appellee nonetheless insists that the provision must be read \u201cin context.\u201d Appellee contends that the City\u2019s position ignores the language of L.E. \u00a7 9-503(a), (b), and (c), as well as the statutory scheme as a whole. Considering the statutory purpose, appellee maintains that the benefits extended under \u00a7 9-503(a) through (d) \u201care incorporated into subsection (e) by reference,\u201d because \u201csubsection (e) is part of a larger compensation system\u201d that \u201crecognizes the fundamental connection between occupational diseases and death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">Claiming \u201cthat the dependent of a covered employee stands in the employee\u2019s shoes,\u201d appellee states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-8\">The Act generally accepts that covered employees who develop occupational diseases may die, it requires employers to compensate the surviving dependents of these employees, and it treats the surviving dependents as the living representatives of the deceased employees. Subsection (e) ... does incorporate by reference the subsections discussing the entitlement of firefighters to receive [combined] compensation if they develop or die from a listed occupational disease.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b607-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-10\"> The issue here is whether L.E. \u00a7 9-503(e) extends to a surviving, dependent spouse of a deceased firefighter who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>died from an occupational disease recognized by L.E. \u00a7 9-503(c).

Therefore, under L.E. \u00a7 9-509(a), compensation pursuant to the Act is ordinarily an injured employee\u2019s exclusive remedy with respect to the employer. <em>The Great Atl. &amp; Pac. Tea Co., Inc. v. Imbraguglio, </em>346 Md. 573, 578, 697 A.2d 885 (1997).

But, as the Court of Appeals has explained several times, including in Polomski, 344 Md. at 76, 684 A.2d 1338, \u201c[although the Act\u2019s name suggests that it was intended solely for the benefit of employees, the preamble to the 1914 Act, and, indeed, [the Court\u2019s] previous holdings, reveal otherwise.\u201d The Court has made clear that, \u201c[i]n reality, the Act protects employees, employers, and the public alike.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 76, 684 A.2d 1338; <em>see Waters, </em>361 Md. at 104, 760 A.2d 663. The <em>Polomski </em>Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-4\">To be sure, the Act maintains a no-fault compensation system for employees and their families for work-related injuries where compensation for lost earning capacity is otherwise unavailable. <em>See Bethlehem-Sparrows Point Shipyard v. Damasiewicz, </em>187 Md. 474, 480, 50 A.2d 799 (1947); <em>Paul v. Glidden Co., </em>184 Md. 114, 119, 39 A.2d 544 (1944). At the same time, however, the Act also recognizes the need to protect employers from the unpredictable nature and expense of litigation, and the public from the overwhelming tax burden of \u201ccaring for the helpless human wreckage found [along] the trail of modern industry.\u201d <em>Liggett &amp; Meyers Tobacco Company v.

Rowe Price, </em>329 Md. 709, 736-37, 621 A.2d 872 (1993). In other words, the Act provides employees suffering from work-related accidental injuries, regardless of fault, with a certain, efficient, and dignified form of compensation. In exchange, employees abandon common law remedies, thereby relieving employers from the vagaries of tort liability. <em>Belcher, </em>329 Md. at 736, 621 A.2d 872 <em>(citing </em>1 Arthur Larson, <em>The Law of Workmen\u2019s Compensation, </em>\u00a7 1.20 at 2 (1992)).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b610-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 76-77, 684 A.2d 1338 (Footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">Thus, the <em>\u201cquid pro quo\u201d </em>for absolute but limited compensation, unrelated to fault, is that employers are \u201crelieved of the prospect of large damage verdicts often associated with litigation.\u201d Arthur Larson, <em>The Law of Workmen\u2019s Compensation, </em>\u00a7 100.01, at 100-2.

At its inception, the Act excluded coverage for occupational diseases; it provided compensation only to employees who were injured in workplace accidents. <em>Harriss, </em>375 Md. at 29, 825 A.2d 365. By 1939, however, the Legislature recognized that accidents are not the only cause of injury to employees. <em>Polomski, </em>344 Md. at 77, 684 A.2d 1338. Therefore, pursuant to Chapter 465 of the Acts of 1939, \u201ccertain occupational diseases\u201d were, for the first time, \u201cdeemed compensable if contracted during the course of employment.\u201d <em>Polomski, </em>344 Md. at 77, 684 A.2d 1338. As a result, employees who were disabled or killed as a result of \u201cspecific enumerated occupational diseases\u201d were deemed eligible for compensation benefits \u201c \u2018as if such disablement or death were an injury by accident.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting Ch. 465. \u00a7 32B of the Acts of 1939).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">By 1951, \u201cthe practice of enumerating specific diseases\u201d in the Act was \u201cabandoned,\u201d and all occupational diseases suffered during the course of employment were \u201cdeemed com-pensable,\u201d subject to certain conditions not pertinent here. <em>Polomski, </em>344 Md. at 77-8, 684 A.2d 1338. But, as with accidental injuries, the claimant had the burden of proving the occupational nature of the disease or condition. <em>Id. </em>at 78, 684 A.2d 1338.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">Then, in 1971, some thirty years after the Act was amended to permit compensation for occupational diseases, the General Assembly amended the Act again, \u201cgrant[ing] a presumption of compensability in favor of certain classes of fire fighters suffering from heart or lung disease, or hypertension.\u201d <em>Id. See </em>Chapter 695 of the Acts of 1971. Similarly, the Legislature adopted what is now L.E. \u00a7 9-503(c), which provides that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>a firefighter who develops leukemia, pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, rectal cancer, or throat cancer is presumed to have done so as a result of his employment. These enactments reflect the Legislature\u2019s view that firefighters are \u201csusceptible to diseases formerly not recognized as occupational.\u201d <em>Polomski, </em>344 Md. at 78, 684 A.2d 1338. In 1972, the Act was further extended to afford similar protections to certain categories of police officers. <em>See </em>Ch. 282 of the Acts of 1972.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">With this framework, we return to the issue before us. Although we have not uncovered any Maryland case directly on point, <em>Polomski is of </em>interest, because it concerned a retired and disabled firefighter\u2019s attempt to recover dual benefits under L.E. \u00a7 9-503. While the case is not controlling, in that it did not address the question of a surviving spouse\u2019s entitlement to combined benefits, it is helpful to review it.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">After working as a firefighter for more than thirty years, Polomski obtained a \u201ctime-earned\u201d service retirement, from which he received $564.35 per week. <em>Id. </em>at 73, 684 A.2d 1338. Soon thereafter, pursuant to L.E. \u00a7 9-503, Polomski also sought workers\u2019 compensation benefits, based on a variety of work-related ailments, including hypertension and heart disease. <em>Id. </em>The Commission awarded Polomski compensation benefits of $451 per week. <em>Id. </em>at 74, 684 A.2d 1338. The combined pension and compensation benefits substantially exceeded Polomski\u2019s average weekly salary of $676.32. On appeal to the circuit court, the City did not challenge the worker\u2019s right to dual benefits. Instead, the City argued that, under the express terms of L.E. \u00a7 9\u2014503(d)(2) (now \u00a7 9-503(e)(2)), the total payment to the firefighter could not exceed the worker\u2019s salary. Therefore, the City maintained that Polomski\u2019s compensation benefits had to be limited to $111.97. <em>Id. </em>The circuit court upheld the Commission. <em>Id. </em>at 75, 684 A.2d 1338. Agreeing with the City that Polomski\u2019s combined total benefits could not exceed his weekly wage, we reversed. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b613-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>Unhappy with the reduction of his compensation award, Polomski sought <em>certiorari. </em>In the Court of Appeals, he argued that the offset provision in former L.E. \u00a7 9\u2014503(d)(2) \u201conly applies when workers\u2019 compensation benefits and retirement benefits are the result of the same disabling event.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 79, 684 A.2d 1338. Because his retirement benefits were service-related, paid to him \u201cby virtue of age and length of service,\u201d <em>id., </em>Polomski claimed he was \u201centitled to the full measure of both workers\u2019 compensation benefits and retirement benefits, without reduction or offset.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court disagreed. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b613-4\">The Court considered whether former \u00a7 9\u2014503(d)(2), the predecessor to what is now L.E. \u00a7 9\u2014503(e)(2), required the \u201creduction of workers\u2019 compensation benefits for a disability caused by an occupational disease paid to a retired fire fighter who is also receiving retirement benefits under a service pension plan.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 73, 684 A.2d 1338. Significantly, the Court took no issue with the firefighter\u2019s recovery of dual benefits. But, the Court made clear that payment of such dual benefits \u201cshall be adjusted\u201d so that the weekly total of the retirement benefits and workers\u2019 compensation benefits \u201cdoes not exceed the weekly salary that was paid to the ... firefighter.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 82, 684 A.2d 1338. It observed, <em>id. </em>at 84, 684 A.2d 1338:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-5\">[T]he clear language of \u00a7 9\u2014503(d)(2) [now \u00a7 9\u2014503(e)(2) ] negated the need to look elsewhere for its meaning. The section specifically and unambiguously requires that Polom-ski\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation benefits be reduced to the extent that, when combined with his retirement benefits, the sum does not exceed his weekly salary. If [the statute] is to be amended to require a setoff against only \u201csimilar benefits,\u201d that amendment must come from the General Assembly, not this Court. Polomski\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation benefits must accordingly be reduced.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">Under <em>Polomski, </em>L.E. \u00a7 9-503(e) permits a retired, disabled firefighter suffering from an occupational disease to collect compensation benefits and service pension benefits, capped at the amount of the worker\u2019s salary. But, \u00a7 9-503(e) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>contains no corresponding language authorizing payment of combined benefits to a firefighter\u2019s surviving, dependent spouse. In contrast, \u00a7 9\u2014610(a)(1) specifically states that compensation benefits paid by a governmental unit to a covered employee, \u201cor, in the case of death, to the dependents of the covered employee,\u201d shall be offset by payment of any governmental pension benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">Resolution of the dispute presented here leads us directly to the principles of statutory construction. The seminal tenet of statutory construction compels us to ascertain and effectuate the legislative intent. <em>Consolidated Constr. Servs., Inc. v.

L.E. \u00a7 9-681(a) states: \u201cIf there are individuals who were wholly dependent on a deceased covered employee at the time of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>death resulting from an accidental personal injury or occupational disease, the employer or its insurer shall pay death benefits in accordance with this section.\u201d The text of that section is in marked contrast to the text of L.E. \u00a7 9-503(e); the latter provision contains no language that expressly permits the payment of combined benefits to a surviving dependent of a firefighter who has died from an occupational disease. Surely, if the Legislature intended a surviving dependent to recover dual benefits, it would have said so.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Indeed, as the Court observed in <em>Polomski, </em>344 Md. at 83, 684 A.2d 1338, the General Assembly is not obligated \u201cto treat all public employees in relation to their pension and retirement benefits similarly.\u201d It follows that the Legislature is not required to treat equally a firefighter and his or her spouse. Rather, the Legislature may have sought to find a balance between compensation to firefighters, in accordance with the presumption, and protection of a municipal employer\u2019s \u201cpublic coffers.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">Even assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that the Legislature inadvertently omitted the word \u201cdependent\u201d from L.E. \u00a7 9\u2014503(e), that would not advance appellee\u2019s cause. When \u201c \u2018an omission in the language of a statute ... appeared to be the obvious result of inadvertence,\u2019 \u201d a court may \u201c \u2018not invade the function of the legislature\u2019 by reading missing language into a statute\u201d to correct the error. <em>Graves v. State, </em>364 Md. 329, 351, 772 A.2d 1225 (2001) (citation omitted). <em>See also Fisher and Utley v. State, </em>367 Md. 218, 292, 786 A.2d 706 (2001) (Bloom, J., concurring and dissenting) (stating that courts \u201cmay not ... <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>supply missing language when there is a <em>casus omissus </em>in the legislative scheme by judicially creating a statutory provision that the legislature would probably have added if it had given any thought to the problem it had not addressed\u201d); <em>Mutual Life Ins. Co. of New York v.

Because we cannot graft language onto L.E. \u00a7\u00a7 9-503(e) that is not part of that provision, we conclude that the Commission and the circuit court erred in finding that, under L.E. \u00a7 9-503(e), Mrs. Johnson is entitled to receive combined compensation and pension benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY REVERSED.

COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLEE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b595-8\">. Although Ernest Johnson is deceased, the parties refer to him as the appellee. We shall do the same.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b596-7\">. Mrs. Johnson claimed that she did not file the claim until 1998 because she did not know that she had the right to do so. In proceedings before the Commission, the Subsequent Injury Fund, which was impleaded by the City, raised the issue of the statute of limitations. The Fund is not a party to this appeal, nor has the City pursued the issue of limitations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b598-10\">. Appellant cites the provisions as they appear in the 2003 Supplement of the Code. Although that precise language was not necessarily in effect at the time of Mr. Johnson\u2019s death or when the Commission or the circuit court ruled, any differences are not material with respect to the issue presented here. Therefore, we shall cite to the current statutory text.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b608-5\">. L.E. \u00a7 9\u2014101(e)(1) defines \"compensation\u201d as \"the money payable under this title to a covered employee or the dependents of a covered employee.\u201d In <em>Victory Sparkler &amp; Specialty Co. v. Francks, </em>147 Md. 368, 379, 128 A. 635 (1925), the Court defined an occupational disease as \"one which arises from causes incident to the profession or labor of the party\u2019s occupation or calling. It has its origin in the inherent nature or mode of work of the profession or industry, and it is the usual result or concomitant.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b618-6\">. We note that, to support its position, the City relies on language in L.E. \u00a7 9-503(e) referring to a <em>\"paid </em>firefighter....\u201d It argues from that language that, because a dead firefighter cannot be \"a paid firefighter,\u201d the section obviously does not authorize dual payments to a dead firefighter's surviving dependent. In focusing on the word \"paid,\u201d we believe the City has taken the term out of context. Elsewhere in L.E. \u00a7 9-503, the text discusses benefits to both paid public safety officers and volunteer public safety officers. More than likely, the use of the word \"paid\u201d in L.E. \u00a7 9-503(e) was meant to refer to those individuals who are not volunteers, rather than those who are still alive.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
