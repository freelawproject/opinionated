RODOWSKY (retired, specially assigned), Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b739-12\">Here we are asked to determine the proper distribution of the assets of Saul Feld, who died testate on March 9, 1997, leaving a multi-million dollar estate. Alvin Frater and Milton Williams, the personal representatives of Mr. Feld\u2019s estate, appellants, challenge an order of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, exercising the jurisdiction of an orphans\u2019 court (hereinafter Orphans\u2019 Court), directing them to amend their Revised Sixth and Final Administration Account (the Final Account). Mr. Feld\u2019s widow, Adele Feld, timely had elected to take a statutory share of her husband\u2019s estate. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>order directs the appellants to credit Adele Feld with one-half of the net value of the estate as of the time of distribution, rather than as of the time of Mr. Feld\u2019s death, as appellants had proposed. David Paris (Paris), the trustee of the Adele Feld Revocable Trust, appellee, the assignee of Adele Feld\u2019s interest, represents Mrs. Feld\u2019s interests in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">The Personal Representatives present the following question for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-6\">\u201cDid the [Orphans\u2019 Court] err when it ordered on May 22, 2003 that Mrs. Feld, as electing surviving spouse, \u2018is to receive one half of the net estate for distribution, ... and including fifty percent (50%) [of] all income earned on estate assets up to the date of distribution,\u2019 because: (a) she was not entitled to a statutory share of any part of her late husband[\u2019s] estate except that of which he was seized or possessed when he died, and (b) her share was fixed and limited at and as of the date of his death and not at any subsequent date of distribution?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">For the reasons set forth below, we shall dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-8\">FACTS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b740-9\">Three days after Mr. Feld\u2019s death, on March 12, 1997, his will was submitted to the Register of Wills for Montgomery County. On March 21, Mrs. Feld timely elected to take her statutory share, <em>i.e., </em>fifty percent of the estate,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> rather than any bequest to her under her husband\u2019s will. After an auditor in the Register of Wills\u2019 office questioned the distribution in the proposed Final Account that had been filed on April 30, 2002, the appellants, by letter of August 30, 2002, requested a hearing \u201cto resolve the determination of the amount due Adele Feld[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b741-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>The Personal Representatives formally petitioned the court on October 23, 2002, to accept the Final Account. Their petition explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-5\">\u201cYour Petitioners calculated [Mrs. Feld\u2019s] share to be $1,202,089.45, which is one-half of the decedent\u2019s gross estate on March 9, 1997, $2,404,434.88, less debts owed by decedent, $255.98, leaving a net estate of $2,404,178.90, all in accordance with <em>Grove v. Frame, </em>285 Md. 691, 402 A.2d 892 (1979), as stated in the annotation to Sec 3-203 of the Estates and Trusts Article, that \u2018In the absence of fraud, the only interest a widow can assert in lieu of taking under her husband\u2019s will is to a share of the property owned by her deceased husband at the time of his death.\u2019 \u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">Paris opposed the distribution proposed in the Final Account, asserting that Mrs. Feld\u2019s share was a fifty percent interest in the net estate, calculated at the time of <em>distribution </em>rather than on the date of her husband\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">On May 2, 2003, after a hearing on the issue, the court ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-8\">\u201c[F]or the purposes of this case, the Court directs the personal representatives to correct the computation in the account and reflect the share of Adele Feld to include the assets plus any realized gain in income as opposed to excluding same.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b741-9\">A docket entry, dated May 2, 2003, reads: \u201cMinutes of hearing on the petition to accept sixth and final account. Denied (see file)[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b741-10\">Thereafter, on May 22, 2003, the Orphans\u2019 Court issued a written order, the relevant part of which stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-11\">\u201cORDERED, that the Personal Representatives shall forthwith restate the Sixth and Final Account to properly reflect that she, Adele Feld, or her assignee, is to receive one half <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>of the net estate for distribution, after deduction for the payment of debts of the decedent and expenses of administration, but without deduction for Federal Estate or Maryland Estate taxes paid by the estate, and including fifty percent (50%) of all income earned on estate assets up to the date of distribution.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">A docket entry for that date reads: \u201cOrder of court approving restated second and final account ... (ROW note: Should read order directing restated sixth and final account be filed).\u201d The Personal Representatives noted this appeal on June 23, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AsQ5\">Preliminary Issues</p>\n<p id=\"b742-7\">Paris asserts that the appeal is not properly before us. He argues, first, that the Personal Representatives lack standing to appeal the order of the Orphans\u2019 Court because they, in their representative capacities, were not \u201caggrieved\u201d by that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-8\">Second, he contends that the appeal was untimely. He submits that the May 2, 2003 oral ruling, when entered on the docket sheet, constituted the \u201cfinal judgment,\u201d rather than the May 22, 2003 written order that was docketed that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-9\">In support of his argument on standing, Paris relies on a number of Maryland cases, which we shall review below.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-10\">In <em>Webster v. Larmore, </em>270 Md. 351, 311 A.2d 405 (1973), the personal representative sought an order in the orphans\u2019 court directing distribution of the residue of the testator\u2019s estate to certain beneficiaries. The court directed that these monies be distributed differently than the personal representative had suggested. Thereafter, the personal representative appealed, but the Court of Appeals held that the appeal was not properly before it. The Court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-11\">\u201c[Ojnce a will has been construed by an equity court, a personal representative is bound to make distribution in accordance with that court\u2019s order, since the personal repre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>sentative is fully protected by it .... We see no reason why the same rationale should not be applied to the order of an orphans\u2019 court directing distribution particularly when [Md. Code (1957, 1973 Cum. Supp.),] Art. 93, \u00a7 9\u2014112(c), under which [the personal representative] acted, specifically granted him protection^]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b743-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 354, 311 A.2d at 406.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Because the personal representative was fully protected, he \u201ccould be in no way aggrieved[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>Further, since the appeal in no way benefited the estate, the Court held, \u201cthe estate should not be reduced by an appeal from which it would gain no advantage[.]\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">In <em>Alston v. Gray, </em>303 Md. 163, 492 A.2d 900 (1985), the personal representative, after having been informed that the testator may have fathered an unborn child, filed in the orphans\u2019 court a petition for instructions regarding the final distribution of the assets of the estate. After conducting a legitimacy hearing, the orphans\u2019 court directed the personal representative to list the unborn child as an interested party in subsequent proceedings, and to allocate a distributive share of the testator\u2019s assets to the unborn child. The personal representative appealed the order, but the Court of Appeals dismissed the appeal as not properly before it because the personal representative was not aggrieved by the order from which she appealed. The Court outlined the reasons for this rule as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-7\">\u201cFirst, ... once a court determination is made, a personal representative is bound to make distribution in accordance with the order, and is fully protected by it. Second, an unrestricted right of appeal would subject the court to a myriad of collateral and incidental matters, and \u2018would open the door to appeals presenting issues which might well be moot, or seeking opinions on abstract propositions.\u2019 To these formerly articulated reasons, we also recognize that an unlimited right of appeal, in the hands of the executor or representative, could seriously deplete a small estate and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>might delay indefinitely the distribution of the estate assets to deserving heirs.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b744-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 167, 492 A.2d at 902 (quoting <em>Webster, </em>270 Md. at 353, 311 A.2d at 406).</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\"><em>Buchwald v. Buchwald, </em>175 Md. 103, 199 A. 795 (1938), involved an executor who filed, both in his individual and representative capacities, a bill in the orphans\u2019 court against the heirs at law, requesting the court to determine the legal effect of the bequests in the will. The orphans\u2019 court held a number of provisions in the will to be inoperative and void. The executor appealed that order, in both his individual and representative capacities. After determining that the orphans\u2019 court indeed had erred in invalidating certain provisions in the will, including some affecting the executor, individually, the Court of Appeals dismissed, for lack of ag-grievement, the appeal by the executor in his representative capacity. <em>Id. </em>at 114, 199 A. at 800.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">The executor in <em>Surratt v. Knight, </em>162 Md. 14, 158 A. 1 (1932), requested an orphans\u2019 court to determine the validity of the residuary clause of the will, and to determine the validity and effect of assignments made by the residuary legatees under a compromise settlement agreement with the testator\u2019s daughter. The orphans\u2019 court dismissed the complaint and the executor appealed. Concluding that the executor was not aggrieved, either individually or in his representative capacity, the Court of Appeals dismissed the executor\u2019s appeal, holding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-7\">\u201c[A]fter the dismissal by the chancellor, the executor had no personal interest in further litigation. There is no question affecting the proceeds of the testator\u2019s estate in his hands for distribution, no doubt of who the residuary legatees are, nor of their identity and of their capacity to take. The executor\u2019s commissions and allowances are not involved, and he has no interest in the fund to be divided. Every one but the executor is satisfied, and no one has united in the appeal. It does not appear from the record that the executor has in any capacity such an interest in the subject-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>matter as entitles him to appeal, and therefore this appeal must be dismissed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b745-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 17, 158 A. at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">In <em>Grabill v. Plummer, </em>95 Md. 56, 51 A. 823 (1902), an administratrix petitioned an orphans\u2019 court to allow attorney\u2019s fees, after she successfully had defended a caveat to the will. The court granted the request, but ordered that the counsel fees be deducted only from the share of those beneficiaries taking under the will, and not from the share of the testatrix\u2019s widower, who had elected a statutory share of his deceased wife\u2019s estate. Dismissing the administratrix\u2019s appeal from the orphans\u2019 court\u2019s order, the Court of Appeals held that the administratrix \u201chal'd] no interest in the subject-matter of the appeal, and [could] not be aggrieved by the passage of the order.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 60, 51 A. at 824.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-7\">Here, there is no appeal by any of the legatees whose participation in the distribution of income earned during administration would be reduced in a Final Account, revised to comply with the order of the court below.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Under the cases reviewed above, the personal representatives have no standing to appeal the order of the court below. Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b745-8\">The Merits</p>\n<p id=\"b745-9\">In light of the possibility of further appellate review, judicial efficiency prompts us also to address the merits. These turn on the construction of the controlling statute, ET \u00a7 3-203. It is best understood in its historical context.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-10\">Md.Code (1924), Article 93, \u00a7 311, in relevant part, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>\u201cIf the election be of the legal share of both real and personal estate, the surviving husband or wife shall take one-third of the lands, as an heir, and one-third of the surplus personal estate (if the deceased spouse shall be survived by descendants) and one-half of the lands, as an heir, and one-half of the surplus personal estate (if the deceased spouse shall not be survived by descendants) and no more.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">The Court of Appeals interpreted \u201csurplus personal estate\u201d in this statute in <em>Gardner v. Mercantile Trust Co. of Baltimore, </em>164 Md. 280, 280, 164 A. 663, 665 (1933). The orphans\u2019 court dismissed exceptions to an account in which the executor had credited to the surviving spouse, who had elected her statutory share, one-half of the estate balance at the time of distribution. The Court of Appeals affirmed the approval of the account, interpreting \u201csurplus personal estate\u201d to mean \u201cthe entire balance of personal estate, principal and income, at the time of distribution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 283, 164 A. at 665. The Court explained that whether a surviving spouse elects to take under the will or a statutory share, the surviving spouse is \u201centitled to possession only at the time of distribution; the amount in the one case being fixed in advance by the will, in the other being undetermined until ascertainment of the surplus for distribution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 282-83, 164 A. at 664-65. The <em>Gardner </em>holding was applied in <em>Mercantile Trust Co. of Baltimore v. Schloss, </em>165 Md. 18, 31, 166 A. 599, 604 (1933).</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">In Md. Code (1957, 1964 Repl. Vol.), former \u00a7 311 appeared as part of Article 93, \u00a7 329(b). In 1969, as a result of the proposals of the Henderson Commission, former \u00a7 329 was revised, and the provisions conferring the right of election and the proportion of the elective share were separated. The former, codified as Article 93, \u00a7 3-203, in relevant part read: \u201cThe surviving spouse may elect to take, in lieu of such property, if any, as may be left to him by will, the share which he might take in intestacy ..., except that under no circumstances may the surviving spouse who makes such an election take more than the share described in subsection (3) of \u00a7 3-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>102 [specifying shares in intestacy].\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Md. Code (1957, 1969 Repl. Vol., 1969 Cum. Supp.), Article 93, \u00a7 3-203. Incorporated \u00a7 3-102 referred to a surviving spouse\u2019s share of the \u201cnet estate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 3-101 and 3-102.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">In 1974, former Article 93 was revised and recodified in the Estates and Trusts Article. Former \u00a7 3-203 became Md. Code (1974), ET \u00a7 3-203 and read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-6\">\u201c(a) General.\u2014Instead of property left to him by will, the surviving spouse may elect to take the share which he might take in intestacy under \u00a7 3-102.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-7\">\u201c(b) Limitation.\u2014The surviving spouse who makes this election may not take more than the share described in \u00a7 3-102(d).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b747-8\">The statute next was amended by the Acts of 1978, ch. 111. At that time, subsection (c) was added, which read: \u201c(c) <em>Calcvlation of net </em>estate.\u2014For the purposes of this section, the net estate shall be calculated without a deduction for the tax as defined in \u00a7 11-109.\u201d Md. Code (1974, 1978 Cum. Supp.), ET \u00a7 3-203(c). Subsection (a) was revised at that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>time to specify that the share that a surviving spouse may elect is, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201ca one-half share of the net estate\u201d if there is no surviving issue. In subsection (b), the words \u201cone-half share of the net estate\u201d were substituted for \u201cthe share described in \u00a7 3-102(d).\u201d A 1992 amendment simply substituted a reference to a section of the Tax-General Article in subsection (c), in place of ET \u00a7 11-109.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">The result of these amendments is the version of ET \u00a7 3-203 that was in force at the time of Mr. Feld\u2019s death, and which is the subject of this appeal. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-6\">\u201c(a) General.\u2014Instead of property left to him by will, the surviving spouse may elect to take a one-third share of the net estate if there is also a surviving issue, or a one-half share of the net estate if there is no surviving issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-7\">\u201c(b) Limitation.\u2014The surviving spouse who makes this election may not take more than a one-half share of the net estate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-8\">\u201c(c) <em>Calculation of net </em>estate.\u2014For the purposes of this section, the net estate shall be calculated without a deduction for the tax as defined in \u00a7 7-308 of the Tax-General Article.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b748-9\">Md. Code (1974, 2001 Repl. Vol.), ET \u00a7 3-203. The term \u201cnet estate\u201d is defined in ET \u00a7 1-101, as \u201cthe property of the decedent exclusive of the family allowance and enforceable claims against the estate, except as used in \u00a7\u00a7 3-102 and 3-203.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b749-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>The appellants deny the applicability of <em>Gardner, </em>asserting that it was decided under a statute that is no longer in effect. Paris contends that the holding of <em>Gardner </em>is just as applicable to the 1997 version of ET \u00a7 3-203 as it was to Md. Code (1974), Article 93, \u00a7 311. He argues that in \u201c[rjeplacing the use of a decedent\u2019s surplus personal estate and realty as the basis for calculating the intestate share of a surviving spouse renouncing a will [with the \u201cnet estate\u201d], the net estate was clearly intended [by the Legislature] only to effectuate the merger of real and personal property.\u201d Our review of the statute\u2019s evolution reveals nothing to suggest that the Legislature, through its amendments, or the Henderson Commission, in its recommendations to the Legislature, intended to change Maryland law under which the elective share participates in income produced during administration.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-4\">The Personal Representatives urge us to extrapolate upon the reasoning of <em>Grove v. Frame, </em>285 Md. 691, 402 A.2d 892 (1979), an action by a widow against her late husband\u2019s estate. The parties had experienced significant marital discord, and the wife had filed a complaint seeking alimony. Between the time that the alimony complaint was filed, and the date of the hearing on that matter, the husband, for a nominal consideration and for the purpose of forcing his wife out of the home, conveyed away the home. He had owned the home prior to their marriage, and it remained titled solely in his name until conveyed. The wife contended that the conveyance was a fraud, committed by the husband during his lifetime, on her rights, either to alimony or to share in his estate. Holding that the husband had every right to convey away the property before his death, the Court of Appeals commented that \u201ca widow is entitled to no part of her husband\u2019s estate except that of which he died seized or possessed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 695, 402 A.2d at 895. Because the husband relinquished all control of the home during his lifetime, that property could not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>considered part of his estate at death. <em>Id. </em>at 696, 402 A.2d at 895. Referencing the wife\u2019s claim of fraud, the Court stated that the wife could only set aside her husband\u2019s transfer of the home by providing proof that he defrauded her by failing fully to relinquish control over the property. In this context, the Court explained: \u201cIn the absence of fraud, the only interest she can assert in lieu of taking under her husband\u2019s will is to a share of the property owned by her deceased husband at the time of his death.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 697, 402 A.2d at 896.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">The Personal Representatives conclude from the quoted language that only the value of assets held by the decedent at the moment of death forms the basis for calculating a surviving spouse\u2019s elective share. It is clear, however, from reading the statement in context that the Court of Appeals was holding that only property actually owned, <em>ie., </em>property that the decedent holds an interest in, at the time of his death, is included in his estate. As such, <em>Grove </em>says nothing about how the intestate share of a surviving spouse is calculated from that estate. Significantly, <em>Grove </em>in no way concerned the elective share statute. It concerned the gross probate estate. Literally to apply the election statute to the probate estate as of the moment of death would clash with the plain language of ET \u00a7 3-203 which directs, <em>inter alia, </em>that creditors be paid before calculating the elective share on the net estate. <em>Grove </em>is inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-7\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b740-10\">. Because the Felds had no issue, Mrs. Feld\u2019s statutory share was fifty percent. Md. Code (1974, 2001 Repl. VoL), \u00a7 3-203(a) of the Estates &amp; Trusts Article (ET) (\"Instead of property left to him by will, the surviving spouse may elect to take a one-third share of the net estate if there is also a surviving issue, or a one-half share of the net estate if there is no surviving issue\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b741-12\">. The Personal Representatives also explained that they had provided for payment of a $5,000 family allowance to Mrs. Feld. They withheld from Mrs. Feld\u2019s share direct inheritance tax of $11,020.89, and did not deduct any Federal or Slate estate tax.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b743-8\">.

Thus, we have no need to decide the appellee\u2019s alternate ground for dismissal, the asserted lack of timeliness of the appeal. But see Maryland Rule 6-171 and <em>Anthony v.

Had Mr. Feld died on or after October 1, 2003, this appeal likely would not be before us. This is because, by Chapter 234 of the Acts of 2003, effective on October 1, 2003, the Legislature amended ET \u00a7 3-203 to specify that the spouse who elects a statutory share is entitled to a share of the net estate as of the time of distribution. Current ET \u00a7 3-203(e) states: \"For the purposes of this section, a surviving spouse who has elected to take against a will shall be entitled to the surviving spouse's portion of the income earned on the net estate during the period of administration based on a one-third or one-half share, whichever is applicable.\u201d Md.
