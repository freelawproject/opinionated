The case involves a dispute between Heartwood 88, Inc. (\u201cHeartwood\u201d), appellant, and Montgomery County (the \u201cCounty\u201d), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>appellee, with regard to a tax sale of real property conducted by the County, at which it mistakenly sold 331 properties to Heartwood for which the owners were not then delinquent in payment of their real property taxes. Upon discovery of the errors, the County refunded the purchase monies to Heartwood for all of the sales, along with interest at the rate of 8%. Nevertheless, Heartwood claimed that it was entitled to interest at the \u201credemption rate\u201d of 20%, amounting to $208,648.17, because that is the rate that would have applied if the sales had been valid and the owners had redeemed their properties. Appellant also sought to recover statutory attorney\u2019s fees of $400 for each of the 331 properties, totaling $132,400, along with other expenses. The Circuit Court for Montgomery County rejected Heartwood\u2019s claims and ordered Heartwood to return the County\u2019s interest payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">Heartwood poses two questions for our consideration:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-5\">I. Did the circuit court err in refusing to award Heartwood interest at the 20% redemption rate plus statutory attorney\u2019s fees and other expenses incurred?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-6\">II. Did the circuit court err in concluding that interest paid to Heartwood by Montgomery County was paid without legal authority and that the County was therefore entitled to judgment?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">For the reasons discussed below, we shall affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">\n<em>FACTUAL SUMMARY</em>\n<footnotemark>\n<em>1</em>\n</footnotemark>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b361-9\">In May 2000, the County advertised its annual sale of parcels of real property located in the County, for which the payment of property taxes was delinquent. The County\u2019s notice of sale stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-10\">The tax sale is open to the public. Prospective bidders should investigate the properties. There is no warranty, expressed or implied, that a property has a marketable title <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>or that it contains the area of land which it is said to contain; therefore, the purchaser assumes all risks in that regard. Purchasers will receive a certif\u00edcate of sale as required by law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-4\"><em>In the event a tax sale is subsequently invalidated, the tax sale purchaser, upon the surrender of the Tax Sale Certificate, mil receive a refund of the amount paid at tax sale, including interest calculated at 8%. The County will pay no expenses associated with the sale or invalidation. </em>The list of delinquent taxpayers shown below may include taxpayers who paid their taxes since the list was submitted to the newspaper for publication, and does not necessarily mean that their taxes are still delinquent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-5\">During the advertising period, May 18th through June 8th [of 2000], properties will be removed from groups [of properties for sale] predicated on payments received from taxpayers. Therefore, the final newspaper advertisement on June 8th will list groups with fewer properties then were originally advertised.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-6\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-7\">Pursuant to 1999 tax sale legislation, the County must establish a high-bid premium for all properties sold in groups and/or by a sealed bid process. This high-bid premium is 20% of the amount by which the bid exceeds 40% of the properties\u2019 full cash value. The high-bid premium is payable at the same time the successful bidder pays the tax sale amount.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-8\">The County will refund the high-bid premium, <em>without interest, </em>to the holder of the tax sale certificate on redemption of the property or to the plaintiff in an action to foreclose the right of redemption on delivery of a tax sale deed for the property for which the high-bid premium was paid. The high-bid premium is not refundable after the time required (under Section 14-833) for the filing of an action to foreclose the right of redemption, if there has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>no redemption and if an action to foreclose the right of redemption has not been filed within that time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">Appellant participated in the tax sale, which was held on June 12, 2000. At that time, the County sold approximately 1,900 properties in twenty-four groups. The sale of the properties was organized by group to insure the sale of all properties, including those that were regarded as less desirable. Appellant was the high bidder for twenty of the groups, consisting of 1,385 individual properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">Accordingly, on June 13, 2000, Heartwood paid the County the sum of $6,868,442.56. Of that sum, $3,934,555.09 represented the amount due for taxes, interest, and penalties. The remaining sum of $2,933,887.47 constituted a statutory, interest-free \u201chigh-bid premium.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellant\u2019s purchases were evidenced by a \u201cCertificate Of Tax Sale,\u201d which the County tendered to appellant for all 1,385 properties. Each tax sale certificate provided, in pertinent part: \u201cUpon redemption, the holder of this certificate will be refunded the sums paid on account of the bid price together with ... interest and penalty ... The interest and penalty will be computed at the rate of 8% and 12% per annum respectively from the date of the tax sale to the date of redemption, together with all other amounts specified by Section 14\u2014813, Annotated Code of Maryland. .. .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">The County concedes that it \u201cmistakenly offered [331] properties at the tax sale even though the taxes had been paid.\u201d According to Glenn Wyman, then Chief of the Treasury Division for the County\u2019s Department of Finance, it was Heartwood that first discovered that the County had sold properties for which the owners were not in arrears. Over a period of months, beginning in December 2000 and continuing through <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>October 2001, the County verified that, as of the time of the tax sale on June 12, 2000, the delinquent taxes and other charges had already been paid by the owners of the 381 properties inadvertently sold by the County at the tax sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">Accordingly, about ten months after the tax sale, in April 2001, the County refunded the sum of $1,276,522.42 to Heartwood, representing reimbursement for the purchase price for the 331 properties. The County also paid Heartwood interest in the amount of $83,621.22, calculated at the rate of <em>8%, </em>consistent with the County\u2019s tax sale notice. In addition, the County refunded the high bid premium that Heartwood had paid, in the amount of $890,537.39, but without interest.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">Heartwood was not satisfied with the interest payment at the 8% rate. It claimed that, because the sale of 331 properties was void, it was entitled to interest at the County\u2019s redemption rate of 20%, amounting to $208,648.17, pursuant to T.P. \u00a7 14-848 and other statutory provisions. Therefore, Heartwood sought an additional $125,026.95 from the County. Further, appellant claimed it was entitled to statutory attorneys\u2019 fees of $400 for each of the 331 properties, totaling $132,400, plus expenses of $2475, pursuant to T.P. \u00a7 14-843.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">On December 6, 2001, after the County refused to pay the additional sums claimed by Heartwood, appellant instituted suit in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County. Styled as a \u201cComplaint For Declaratory Judgment And For Judgment That Tax Sales Were Void,\u201d appellant sued the County and Timothy Firestine, Collector of Taxes and Director of Finance for the County.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In its suit, appellant asked the court to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>declare void the sales of the 331 properties; to order the County to pay interest at the redemption rate of 20%; and to require the County to pay attorneys\u2019 fees of $400 per property, along with costs. The County filed a counterclaim and request for declaratory judgment, seeking to recover the 8% interest that it had previously paid to Heartwood.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\">Following a hearing in October 2002 on the parties\u2019 cross-motions for summary judgment, the circuit court issued a written \u201cOpinion and Order\u201d on December 18, 2002, in which it granted judgment in favor of the County and Firestine. Noting that the parties \u201cagree that the sale of the 331 properties in question was void at the time of the tax sale ... \u201d, the court ruled that Heartwood was not entitled to the requested relief of interest on the refund at the redemption rate of 20%, statutory attorneys\u2019 fees, and expenses. The court said: \u201cSimply put, in order for [Heartwood] to recover interest at the redemption rate, there must be a redemption of the property by the owner.\u201d In its view, \u201c[t]here was no redemption with regard to the 331 properties at issue ... because the sale was void from its inception,\u201d and thus the properties were \u201cnever subject to redemption.\u201d As \u201cthere was no sale for the court to void,\u201d the court determined that T.P. \u00a7\u00a7 14-848 and 14-843 had no application here.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">Moreover, the court determined that appellant was obligated to reimburse the County in the amount of $83,621.22, representing the 8% interest that the County had previously paid to appellant. The court reasoned that the tax collector \u201cdid not have the authority to pay 8% interest because no statute applied to the void tax sale,\u201d and such payment \u201cwas in violation of law.\u201d While acknowledging \u201ca clear representation\u201d that the County would pay interest at 8% for an invalid sale, and noting that \u201cthe three elements of equitable estoppel would appear to be met,\u201d the court nonetheless pointed out <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>that the doctrine of equitable estoppel \u201chas limited application against municipalities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">The court concluded that \u201c[t]he doctrine of equitable estop-pel does not prevent the County from [obtaining] reimbursement of the 8% interest paid in error.\u201d It reasoned that, as against a municipality, the doctrine, <em>\u201cwhen applicable, must be bottomed on the need for the interpretation or clarification of an ambiguous statide or ordinance </em>...\u201d (Citation omitted)(emphasis in court\u2019s opinion). Satisfied that \u201cthere is no ambiguous statute or ordinance that is subject to interpretation,\u201d the court rejected appellant\u2019s argument that the County was \u201csubject to estoppel because the County and the Tax Collector were following a long-standing administrative interpretation .... \u201d Rather, the court was of the view that \u201cthe common law rule of caveat emptor applies to tax sales.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">We shall include additional facts in our discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-8\">Pursuant to Article Xl-A of the Maryland Constitution, known as the \u201cHome Rule Amendment,\u201d counties that opt to adopt a home rule charter for purposes of local governance are able \u201cto achieve a significant degree of political self-determination.\u201d <em>Tyma v. Montgomery County, </em>369 Md. 497, 504, 801 A.2d 148 (2002); <em>see McCrory Corp. v. Fowler, </em>319 Md. 12, 16, 570 A.2d 834 (1990). The \u201cExpress Powers Act,\u201d Md. Ann.Code (1957, 1998 Repl.Vol., 2001 Supp.), Article 25A, is \u201cthe legislative response ... to the directive contained in \u00a7 2 of Article Xl-A\u201d of the State Constitution, which required the General Assembly \u201cto provide a grant of express powers for charter home rule counties.\u201d <em>Tyma, </em>369 Md. at 505, 801 A.2d 148.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-9\">Montgomery County is a charter or home rule county. Therefore, it exercises the express powers granted to it by State law, <em>Tyma, </em>369 Md. at 505, 801 A.2d 148, which means that it enjoys \u201cfull legislative power ... to pass all ordinances\u201d that it \u201cdeem[s] expedient under the police power ...,\u201d sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>ject to the laws of the State and the provisions of Article 25A. <em>Tyma, </em>369 Md. at 506, 801 A.2d 148. These express powers include the right \u201c[t]o provide for the prompt collection of all taxes due the county; and for the sale of real estate, as well as leasehold and personal property, for the payment of the same.\u201d Code, Art. 25A, \u00a7 5(0). However, as noted, there are limitations on a home rule county\u2019s legislative power. Under Section 5(S) of the Express Powers Act, for example, a charter county may not enact an ordinance that conflicts with State law. <em>Tyma, </em>369 Md. at 505-06, 801 A.2d 148.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\">Tax sales of real property \u201care concerned with the payment of taxes on land....\u201d <em>Lippert v. Jung, </em>366 Md. 221, 229, 783 A.2d 206 (2001). The laws regarding tax sales reflect a blend of State and local governmental power. The State\u2019s Tax Sale statute authorizes the State\u2019s political subdivisions to sell real property located in their own jurisdictions, for which property taxes are in arrears. While the General Assembly has carefully crafted legislation that governs much of the process and procedure with respect to such tax sales, <em>see </em>T.P. \u00a7\u00a7 14-808 to 14-863, the local subdivisions are entitled to set the redemption rate of interest that an owner must pay after a tax sale in order to recover the property sold at the sale. That rate, often referred to as the redemption rate, is considered \u201ca matter of local concern.\u201d <em>Fish Market Nominee Corp. v. G.A.A., Inc., </em>337 Md. 1, 11, 650 A.2d 705 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">As Heartwood explains, the effect of a properly conducted tax sale under the State\u2019s statutory scheme is to provide \u201cinterest-free financing\u201d to local subdivisions for unpaid real estate taxes. Because the State\u2019s Tax Sale statute is at the center of this appeal, we begin with a review of the statute and its salient provisions, many of which are interrelated, as well as the pertinent Maryland rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">Upon proper notice to the necessary parties, the Tax Sale statute authorizes a local tax collector to sell property at public auction if an owner\u2019s real property taxes are in arrears. <em>See </em>T.P. \u00a7\u00a7 14-808; 14-817; <em>LaValley v. Rock Point Aero Sport Club, Inc., </em>104 Md.App. 123, 126, 655 A.2d 60, <em>cert. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number><em>denied, </em>339 Md. 354, 663 A.2d 72 (1995). The statute also authorizes the tax collector to set the terms for conducting the tax sale. T.P. \u00a7 14-817 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-4\">\u00a7 14-817. Sale at public auction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-5\">(a) <em>Conduct of sale.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-6\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-7\">(4) The conduct of the sale shall be according to terms set by the collector, and published with a reasonable degree of specificity in the public notice of the tax sale, to ensure the orderly functioning of the public auction and the integrity of the tax sale process....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">Pursuant to County law, the Director of the Department of Finance must conduct the tax sale on the second Monday in June at an hour and place specified in a published notice. That notice is sent by the Department to the owners of property for which taxes remain unpaid. Montg. Co. Code \u00a7 52-36 (1994, as amended).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-9\">Under T.P. \u00a7 14-818, the person or entity who makes a tax sale purchase must pay to the municipality, no later than the day after the tax sale, \u201cthe full amount of taxes due on the property sold\u201d at tax sale, \u201ctogether with interest and penalties on the taxes, expenses incurred in making the sale, and the high-bid premium, if any.\u201d The remainder of the purchase price \u201cremains on credit.\u201d <em>Fish Market, </em>337 Md. at 4, 650 A.2d 705. In return, \u201c[t]he purchaser ... receives a certificate of sale, which is freely assignable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing T.P. \u00a7 14-820, \u00a7 14-821).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-10\">The Tax Sale statute provides for a variety of events to occur after a properly conducted tax sale, some of which are in the alternative. An understanding of these alternative scenarios is important to this case. In general, they involve three categories: the first concerns the owner\u2019s right to redeem the property; the second involves the tax purchaser\u2019s right to foreclose on the property; the third concerns the time period applicable to the right to foreclose. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>First, under T.P. \u00a7 14-827, the property owner has the right to redeem the property sold by the tax collector \u201cat any time until the right of redemption has been finally foreclosed....\u201d To do so, T.P. \u00a7 14-828 requires the redeeming party to pay the tax collector the \u201ctotal price paid at the tax sale for the property together with interest\u201d; plus taxes, interest, and penalties paid by the certificate holder; and taxes, interest, and penalties that have accrued since the date of the tax sale until the date of redemption. <em>See Fish Market, </em>337 Md. at 4, 650 A.2d 705.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\">T.P. \u00a7 14-828(a) states, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-5\">\u00a7 14-828. Required payments; interest rate on redemption; notice to holder of certificate; execution of certificate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">(a) <em>Payments to </em>collector.\u2014If the property is redeemed, the person redeeming shall pay the collector:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-7\">(1) the total price paid at the tax sale for the property together with interest;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-8\">(2) any taxes, interest, and penalties paid by any holder of the certificate of sale;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-9\">(3) any taxes, interest, and penalties accruing after the date of the tax sale....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b369-10\">T.P. \u00a7 14-828(b) provides that the \u201cinterest rate on redemption\u201d is \u201cset under [T.P.] \u00a7 14-820.\u201d The sums referred to in T.P. \u00a7 14-828 are paid by the tax collector to the tax sale purchaser in exchange for the \u201csurrender of the certificate of sale.\u201d <em>See </em>T.P. \u00a7 14-828(c). In <em>Fish Market, </em>337 Md. at 5, 650 A.2d 705, the Court said: \u201cIf the property is redeemed, the holder, upon surrendering the certificate, receives the redemption amount paid to the collector, excluding taxes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b369-11\">In addition, T.P. \u00a7 14-843 pertains to attorney\u2019s fees due \u201con redemption.\u201d It requires the redeeming party to pay attorney\u2019s fees of $400 for each property, plus expenses, to the certificate holder.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-12\">Pursuant to T.P. \u00a7\u00a7 14-833 through 14-844, no sooner than six months from the date of the certificate of tax sale, but no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>later than two years from that date, the certificate holder may file a complaint to foreclose the owner\u2019s right of redemption of the property. T.P. \u00a7 14-836 identifies the various parties to the proceedings. In particular, it denominates the holder of the certificate as the plaintiff and the record title holder of the property as one of the defendants. The form of a complaint to foreclose the right of redemption is governed by T.P. \u00a7 14-835 and Md. Rule 14-502. T.P. \u00a7 14\u2014835(a)(3) and Rule 14-502(a)(3) both provide that the party filing such a complaint must state \u201cthat the property has not been redeemed by any party in interest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">Upon the filing of a complaint to foreclose, the court issues summonses to all defendants and an order to publicize the foreclosure proceeding. <em>See </em>T.P. \u00a7\u00a7 14-839, 840; <em>Fish Market, </em>337 Md. at 6, 650 A.2d 705. Until the court issues a final decree foreclosing the right of redemption, however, the owner\u2019s right of redemption continues. <em>Fish Market, </em>337 Md. at 6, 650 A.2d 705. Moreover, in the event of a controversy as to the amount required for redemption, it is the court\u2019s responsibility to resolve that issue. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">T.P. \u00a7 14-842 is also significant, because it concerns a challenge to the validity of a tax sale. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-6\">\u00a7 14-842. Validity of taxes and sale presumed unless attacked in answer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-7\">In any proceeding to foreclose the right of redemption, it is not necessary to plead or prove the various steps, procedure and notices for the assessment and imposition of the taxes for which the property was sold or the proceedings taken by the collector to sell the property. <em>The validity of the procedure is conclusively presumed unless a defendant in the proceeding shall, by answer., set up as a defense the invalidity of the taxes or the invalidity of the proceedings to sell or the invalidity of the sale. </em>A defendant alleging any jurisdictional defect or invalidity in the taxes or in the proceeding to sell, or in the sale, <em>must particularly specify in the answer the jurisdictional defect or invalidity and must affirmatively establish the defense.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b371-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>(Emphasis added). <em>See also </em>Rule 14-505 (\u201cAny issue as to the validity of the taxes, the proceedings to sell the property, or the sale, shall be raised by separate affirmative defense.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\">In the event the owner fails to redeem the property by the specified date, the court issues a final decree foreclosing the right of redemption. T.P. \u00a7 14-844. Then, upon payment of any amounts that are due, the tax collector issues a deed to the tax purchaser. In this way, the tax purchaser acquires fee simple title to the property. <em>See Gordon Family Partnership v. Gar On Jer, </em>348 Md. 129, 139, 702 A.2d 753 (1997); <em>LaValley, </em>104 Md.App. at 127, 655 A.2d 60 (stating that \u201cthe purchaser acquires absolute title to the property.\u201d). As the Court said in <em>Lippert, </em>366 Md. at 230, 783 A.2d 206: When there is \u201ca valid tax sale and proper foreclosure of the equities of redemption,\u201d the prior title is terminated and a new title is created and \u201cgranted by the sovereign.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">The certificate holder must file a proceeding to foreclose the right of redemption within two years from the date of the tax certificate. If the tax purchaser fails to do so, the sums paid by the tax sale purchaser for the tax certificate, including the high-bid premium, are forfeited. <em>See </em>T.P. \u00a7 14-817(b)(2)(vi); T.P. \u00a7 14-833(d); <em>Gordon Family Partnership, </em>348 Md. at 137, 702 A.2d 753.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">As we have seen, the tax sale purchaser is entitled to a certificate of tax sale. The content of the certificate of tax sale is prescribed by T.P. \u00a7 14-820(a).

It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>\u00a7 14-848.

In this situation, says appellant, T.P. \u00a7 14-848 requires the County to pay \u201cinterest at the rate provided in the certificate of tax sale,\u201d plus \u201cexpenses properly incurred in accordance with this subtitle____\u201d Although the County stated in its notice of sale that it would pay interest of 8% in the event of an invalid sale, appellant asserts that, in setting that amount, the County \u201csimply misconstrued\u201d T.P. \u00a7 14-848. In essence, Heartwood claims that the term \u201cinterest rate\u201d really means the \u201credemption rate\u201d\u2014the sum of the interest and penalty rates of 8% and 12%, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-9\">As noted, T.P. \u00a7 14-848 provides for payment of interest to the tax purchaser at the rate provided in the certificate of sale, as well as payment of \u201call expenses properly incurred in accordance with this subtitle.\u201d T.P. \u00a7 14-843 governs those expenses. It provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-10\">\u00a7 14-843. Plaintiff or holder of certificate of sale reimbursed for expenses incurred.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-11\">(a) <em>In </em>general.\u2014Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, <em>on redemption, </em>the plaintiff or the holder of a certificate of sale is entitled to be reimbursed for expenses incurred in any action or in preparation for any action to foreclose the right of redemption.

Titled \u201cJurisdiction of court,\u201d it states, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-6\">The circuit court, on the filing of a complaint to foreclose the right of redemption, has jurisdiction to give complete relief under this subtitle, in accordance with the general jurisdiction and practice of the court, and with all laws and rules of court that relate to the circuit courts for the county in which the property is located, except as otherwise provided in this subtitle....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">T.P. \u00a7 14-851 concerns the repeal of inconsistent acts and states, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-8\">Any act, whether public general or public local, inconsistent with the provisions of Parts I through III of this subtitle, is repealed to the extent of the inconsistency; but all laws repealed by this subtitle shall nevertheless remain in force in respect to any tax sale made or instituted before December 31, 1943. Any tax sales made or instituted after December 31, 1943, shall be made only in accordance with the provisions of Parts I through III of this subtitle....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-10\">Both sides have presented cogent, multifaceted arguments in support of their diametrically opposing positions.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>Heartwood claims that T.P. \u00a7 14-848 governs the resolution of this case, because it pertains to a tax sale that is void, and these sales were void since the owners had paid their delinquent taxes prior to the tax sale. The underlying premise of Heartwood\u2019s position is its view that the \u201cpurpose of [T.P.] \u00a7 14-848 is to place the tax sale purchaser in the same position [it] would have been in had the sale [of the 331 properties] been properly conducted.\u201d Therefore, Heartwood contends that the properties in issue were subject to a redemption rate of 20%, and the court erred in failing to award Heartwood interest at the redemption rate of 20%. In addition, Heartwood contends that it was entitled by statute to recover attorneys\u2019 fees of $400 for each of the 331 properties in issue, because statutory attorney\u2019s fees are an \u201cexpense\u201d under T.P. \u00a7 14-843 and, under T.P. \u00a7 14-848, the County is liable for \u201call expenses properly incurred in accordance with this subtitle.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">Appellant observes that, \u201cif the payment of the taxes on these properties had not been discovered until after actions to foreclose the right of redemption had been brought and served on the property owners, those property owners would have sought, and been entitled to the entry of, orders declaring the sales void.\u201d In that circumstance, says appellant, the sales would have been voided and then they would have fit squarely within T.P. \u00a7 14-848. In its view, this case is conceptually indistinguishable from the hypothetical outlined above. It matters not, insists Heartwood, that the errors were discovered prior to the filing of an action to foreclose, so that the sales were deemed void without the necessity of legal action by the owners or the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">According to Heartwood, because the County refused to recognize its statutory responsibility under T.P. \u00a7 14-848, Heartwood had the right to initiate legal action to obtain a judicial determination that the sales were void. Appellant maintains that its position is consistent with the view expressed by the County Council that the tax sale purchaser performs \u201ca service to the public\u201d and such activities \u201cshould be encouraged.\u201d To that end, appellant observes that T.P. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>\u00a7 14-832 expressly requires liberal construction of the statute, and T.P. \u00a7 14-834 confers \u201cbroad jurisdiction\u201d on the circuit court in these kinds of matters. Therefore, Heartwood claims that, merely because the taxes on the 331 properties had \u201calready been paid\u201d at the time of the tax sale, and they were \u201cvoid from their inception,\u201d this does not mean that \u201cthere was no sale for the court to void.\u201d Appellant asserts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-4\">To the contrary, if the payment of the taxes on these properties had not been discovered until after actions to foreclose the right of redemption had been brought and served on the property owners, those property owners would have sought, and been entitled to the entry of, orders declaring the sales void.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">Appellant reasons that \u201cthere are many ... examples of sales which, in retrospect, are void from their inception, to which \u00a7 14-848 nevertheless applies.\u201d To illustrate, appellant points to sales for which the legal description in the notice of sale is erroneous, sales of properties that were omitted from the notice of sale, and sales of properties in which the owners go into bankruptcy. Appellant states: \u201cIndeed, it is difficult to imagine an example of a void sale which is not, in retrospect, void from its inception.\u201d Thus, appellant argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-6\">The fact that, in retrospect, these sales were void from their inception, cannot curtail the ability of Heartwood to institute an action to foreclose the rights of redemption in the properties. Heartwood still holds possession of the certificates of sale and was entitled, as it did in this proceeding, to institute actions to foreclose since it had not received all amounts it claims are due under the terms of the certificates and \u00a7 14-848.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">Further, appellant contends that the limiting terms of the County\u2019s tax sale notice are without effect, because the County cannot contravene the provisions of T.P. \u00a7 14-848. Insisting that T.P. \u00a7 14-848 applies here, and authorizes payment of the redemption rate of 20%, appellant asserts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-8\">Surely, the General Assembly did not intend that the County could sell property on which no taxes were due, then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>unilaterally declare the sale void, as the County seeks to do here, and thereby cut off the certificate holder\u2019s right to institute an action to foreclose the right of redemption so as to obtain the return of the amount deposited (with interest). To accept the circuit court\u2019s ruling would produce this result, however. The logical extension of the Court\u2019s conclusion that \u00a7 14-848 does not apply is that the County, in spite of its concession, was not required to refund the deposit amount either. Such an absurd result cannot be countenanced....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">The County vigorously disagrees with appellant. It presents an argument that is sequential in nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">While conceding that it \u201cmistakenly offered\u201d the 331 properties at the tax sale, because the owners had already paid their overdue taxes, the County nevertheless claims that T.P. \u00a7 14-848 was never triggered. It reasons that, because the owners of the 331 properties had paid their delinquent taxes prior to the tax sale, they never had to redeem their properties. As there was no basis for the owners to redeem their properties, the County argues that Heartwood had no basis to file an action to foreclose the right of redemption. In the absence of a foreclosure action, says the County, the court had no basis to declare the tax sales void. And, absent such a judicial determination, the County contends that the remedies in T.P. \u00a7 14-848 \u201cnever became available to Heartwood.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">The County asserts: \u201cTo read the statute to encompass a sale that should not have occurred because the taxes were paid, defies common sense. Heartwood\u2019s construction of the statute fails to comply with Maryland\u2019s statutory construction principles.\u201d In its view, \u201cHeartwood knew the risks associated with purchases of property at tax sale and cannot realistically argue that the Legislature intended a profit in these unusual circumstances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">According to the County, there are only \u201ctwo situations in which a purchaser of property at a tax sale receives expenses and interest on the purchase price as a remedy-when an owner redeems the property, and when a court declares a sale</p>\n<p id=\"b379-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>void in the course of a suit to foreclose redemption.\u201d In its view, \u201c[n]either situation existed in the present case.\u201d The County states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-4\">The General Assembly has accounted for the possibility that an owner may redeem the property at any time before a purchaser obtains a court order and a deed that forecloses the right of redemption. The Legislature also has provided a remedy for those instances in which a purchaser seeks to foreclose the right of redemption, but the court declares the tax sale to be void. In [only] these two situations, the purchaser at the tax sale enjoys remedies beyond the return of the purchase price.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">Moreover, the County maintains that \u201cthe tax collector has no power to sell the property unless the taxes remain unpaid.\u201d Because the taxes were paid prior to the sale, the County claims that all 331 sales were \u201cnull and void.\u201d In this regard, the County argues that it has the independent authority to invalidate and declare \u201cvoid\u201d the 331 sales, without paying the sums that might otherwise be required under T.P. \u00a7 14-848.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">Appellee adds that \u201cthe court reasonably may infer that the absence of a clear remedy reflects consideration and rejection of a remedy for the situation that occurred in this case.\u201d The County states: \u201cAbsent a clear statutory provision that provides a remedy, common law remains in effect,\u201d including the doctrine of <em>caveat emptor. </em>In the County\u2019s view, \u201c[u]nder applicable common law principles, the County had to return only the purchase price and the high-bid premium to Heartwood.\u201d Further, the County argues that \u201c[t]he payment of interest derives solely from statute, so the circuit court correctly ordered Heartwood to return the interest to the County based on the absence of a statutory remedy for the circumstances of this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">Appellee also contends that the plain language of the statute does not provide for reimbursement of legal fees or expenses, except in the case of redemption by the owner or by judicial order in an action to foreclose the right of redemption. As <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>neither event materialized, the County claims that appellant cannot recover legal fees or expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">\u201c[A] tax sale of property on which taxes have been paid is invalid.\u201d <em>Bugg v. State Roads Com., </em>250 Md. 459, 461, 243 A.2d 511 (1968); <em>see Jannenga v. Johnson, </em>243 Md. 1, 8, 220 A.2d 89 (1966); <em>Mullen v. Brydon, </em>117 Md. 554, 559, 83 A. 1025 (1912). Because the delinquent taxes for the 331 properties in issue had actually been paid by the time of the tax sale, the parties agree that the sales of the 331 properties were invalid and void at the time of the sale. Heartwood apparently recognizes that, as a predicate to obtaining the remedies contemplated by T.P. \u00a7 14-848, it must secure a judicial determination that the tax sales were void. Appellant insists, however, that, even though the 331 sales were void at their inception, it was entitled to obtain a judicial declaration pronouncing the sales as void. Then, according to Heartwood, it could invoke T.P. \u00a7 14-848 and require the County to pay the remedies prescribed by that provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">To be sure, appellant did not receive the monies it anticipated from the tax sale. Given the County\u2019s error in regard to the sale of the 331 properties, the question remains whether the County was legally obligated to pay Heartwood the redemption rate of 20%, plus statutory legal fees and expenses, to make appellant whole. The principles of statutory construction frame our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">It is well settled that the interpretation of a statute is a judicial function, <em>Muhl v. Magan, </em>313 Md. 462, 481-82, 545 A.2d 1321 (1988), and requires us to determine and effectuate the legislature\u2019s intent. <em>Consolidated Construction Services, Inc. v.

The tax sale provisions first appeared in the 1902 version of the Maryland Code. The predecessor to T.P. \u00a7 14-848, Chapter 519 of the 1902 Laws of Maryland, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-5\">That where property is erroneously sold for taxes in any of the counties of the State of Maryland through an error in description, <em>or for any other reason, </em>that the parties purchasing said property at tax sales shall be entitled <em>to the same rate of interest </em>as if the sale were made in due and proper form, and whenever an error is discovered at any tax sale, as aforesaid, the County Treasurer or the Commissioners of any county in which there is no treasurer shall make payment to the purchaser of the property sold at said tax sale upon his transferring to them his certificate of purchase at such sale from any funds in their hands.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">The provision quoted above remained in effect until 1943. <em>See </em>Md. Ann.Code (1939), Article 81, \u00a7 200. Then, pursuant to Chapter 761 of the 1943 Laws of Maryland, the State\u2019s tax sale laws were again revised. The scheme set forth in Chapter 761, which is similar to the modern version of the statute, was modeled on Chapter 540 of the 1941 Acts. The 1941 legislation amended the Code of Public Local Laws for Baltimore City, and revised the text with regard to the matter of the payment of interest to a City tax sale purchaser in the event of an invalid tax sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">The 1941 legislation contained in \u00a7 58K of Chapter 540 a provision titled <em>\u201cSale Deemed Invalid. Return of Purchase </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number><em>Price.\u201d </em>It authorized the Baltimore City Solicitor to invalidate a sale and return the sum paid by the tax sale purchaser, <em>but without interest. </em>It stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-4\">When, in the opinion of the City Solicitor, any sale made under the provisions of this Act, was not validly made, for any cause whatever, the purchaser at any such invalid sale shall be refunded the full amount of purchase money paid by him on account of the said sale.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">In addition, \u00a7 62S of Chapter 540 of the 1941 Acts provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AhZ\">If the final decree of the court declares the sale void and sets it aside, the holder of the certif\u00edcate shall be repaid the amount paid to the Collector on account of the purchase price of the property sold, with interest thereon <em>at the rate of six per cent </em>per annum, together with all taxes and other municipal liens accruing subsequent to the date of sale, which were actually paid by the holder of the certificate of sale or his predecessor therein, and all expenses properly incurred in accordance with the provisions of the Act. The Collector shall proceed to a new sale of the property under the provisions of this Act and shall include in such new sale all taxes and other municipal liens which were included in said void sale, and all unpaid taxes and other municipal liens accruing subsequent to the date of the sale declared void.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AqT\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">Notably, the portion of the 1941 enactment contained in \u00a7 58K was not incorporated into the State\u2019s 1943 law. Nor does such a provision appear in the current statute. Appellant suggests that the General Assembly\u2019s failure in 1943 to adopt the 1941 legislation for Baltimore City evidences the legislature\u2019s intent, and establishes that the County \u201chas no authority to declare a sale void without paying the sums required by [T.P.] \u00a7 14-848.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">The language of the 1943 Act resembles the text that is currently in effect. Chapter 761, \u00a7 90P of the 1943 Laws stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-8\"><em>If the final decree of the court declares the sale void and sets it aside, the holder ,of the certificate shall be repaid the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number><em>amount paid to the Collector on account of the purchase pnce of the property sold, with interest thereon </em>at the rate of six per cent per annum, together with all taxes accruing subsequent to the date of sale, which were actually paid by the holder of the certificate of sale or his predecessor therein, <em>and all expenses properly incurred </em>in accordance with the provisions of the sub-title. If the Collector shall have paid the claims of any other taxing agency or agencies he shall be entitled to a refund thereof from such taxing agency or agencies with interest at 6% per annum. The Collector shall proceed to a new sale of the property under the provisions of this sub-title and shall include in such new sale all taxes which were included in said void sale, and all unpaid taxes accruing subsequent to the date of sale declared void.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">The language set forth above remained in effect until 1985, when there was a general revision of the tax laws by the Code Revision Commission. At that time, however, only minor changes were made in the wording of the statute. <em>Compare </em>Annotated Code of Maryland (1951), Article 81, \u00a7 114, and Annotated Code of Maryland (1957), Article 81, \u00a7 116, with Chapter 8, 1986 Laws of Maryland (T.P. \u00a7 14-848) and the Revisor\u2019s Note to T.P. \u00a7 14-848 contained in the Tax-Property Article (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">T.P. \u00a7 14-848 was again revised by Chapter 825 of the 1986 Laws of Maryland. That legislation changed the rate of interest payable to a certificate holder in the case of a void sale from 6%, as enacted in 1943, to \u201cthe rate provided in the certificate of tax sale.\u201d According to appellant, that \u201cchange further emphasizes the intent to restore the purchaser at a void sale to the position he would have been in had the sale been proper and the property subsequently redeemed.\u201d While the statutory interest rates have changed over time, appellant points out that the Code revisions adopted in 1943, 1951, 1957, and 1985 have largely been ones of \u201cstyle.\u201d <em>See </em>Revisor\u2019s Note to T.P. \u00a7 14-848 (1986). <em>See also </em>Md.Code Ann., Chap. 761 (1943); Md.Code, Art. 81 \u00a7 114 (1951); Md. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>Code Ann., Art. 81 \u00a7 116 (1957); Md.Code., T.P. \u00a7 14-848 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">In our view, analysis of the statutory scheme as a whole exposes appellant\u2019s flawed construction of the statute. The legislative history of T.P. \u00a7 14-848 does not establish that the legislature intended the tax sale purchaser to recover the redemption rate from the local government under the circumstances attendant here. Indeed, considering that tax sale purchasers are regarded as performing a public service, it is hard to reconcile how appellant\u2019s position would comport with the public interest; the municipality that is meant to benefit from the tax sale would have to bear a hefty cost, ultimately at taxpayer expense. Moreover, we see no statutory or historical basis that would lead us to conclude that the legislature sought to protect or favor tax sale purchasers in the way that appellant suggests, by eliminating the risk associated with an error committed by the municipality. We explain further.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">By its terms, for a tax purchaser to obtain the remedies provided by T.P. \u00a7 14-848, the court must \u201cdeclare[ ] the [tax] sale void and set[ ] it aside.... \u201d As noted, in an attempt to come within the ambit of T.P. \u00a7 14-848, appellant sought to obtain a judicial ruling that the 331 sales were void, although the parties agreed they were void at inception. Heartwood has not convinced us that the unusual situation presented here entitled it to such a judicial declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">The statute clearly recognizes that there may be invalid tax sales. In that event, a court is certainly empowered to declare a tax sale as invalid. For that to occur, however, the tax purchaser must first present to the court a complaint to foreclose the owner\u2019s right of redemption, T.P. \u00a7 14-833 et. seq., <em>and, </em>in response, the defendant must then file an answer alleging as an affirmative defense the \u201cinvalidity of the taxes or the invalidity of the proceedings to sell.... \u201d T.P. \u00a7 14-842.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">In this case, because the 331 owners had paid their delinquent taxes prior to the tax sale, redemption was not warranted. In turn, Heartwood was not statutorily entitled to file a complaint to foreclose, because it could not represent to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>court that \u201cthe property has not been redeemed,\u201d as required by T.P. \u00a7 14-835(a)(3). And, without a complaint to foreclose, the record owners had no grounds on which to file answers challenging the validity of the tax sales, as provided by T.P. \u00a7 14-842.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">Nor did Heartwood have a statutory right to insist that the court issue a judicial decree to declare the 331 sales as void, just so that it could bring itself within the purview of T.P. \u00a7 14-848. Put another way, Heartwood had no viable cause of action to foreclose the rights of redemption, which was a predicate to a judicial determination with regard to the validity of the tax sales. And, the plain language of T.P. \u00a7 14-848 establishes that, because the court did not declare void the sales of the 331 properties (and had no grounds to do so), appellant did not qualify for the remedies provided in T.P. \u00a7 14-848.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">Even assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that T.P. \u00a7 14-848 extends to the situation in the case <em>sub judice, </em>involving the County\u2019s mistaken sale of properties, we do not construe T.P. \u00a7 14-848 to authorize payment to Heartwood at the redemption rate of 20%. As we observed, the redemption rate is \u201ca matter of local concern.\u201d <em>Fish Market, </em>337 Md. at 11, 650 A.2d 705. In the County, the redemption rate represents the sum of the interest rate of 8% and the penalty rate of 12%, two distinct components. Indeed, the County\u2019s Certificate of Tax Sale clearly distinguishes between interest and penalties. It provides that, \u201c[u]pon redemption,\u201d the certificate holder is entitled to a refund of the \u201csums paid on account ... together with interest and penalty----The interest and penalty will be computed at the rate of 8% and 12% per annum respectively....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b388-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>The County\u2019s notice of the tax sale for June 12, 2000, is consistent with the notion that the interest rate is a separate element of the redemption rate. It stated, in part: \u201cIn the event a tax sale is subsequently invalidated, the tax sale purchaser, upon the surrender of the Tax Sale Certificate, will receive a refund of the amount paid at tax sale, including interest calculated at <em>8%.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">Interestingly, while T.P. \u00a7 14-820(b) refers to the \u201crate of redemption,\u201d and the cases have recognized a \u201credemption rate\u201d in regard to tax sales, <em>see, e.g., Fish Market, </em>337 Md. at 5, 650 A.2d 705, the statute distinguishes between interest and penalties. To illustrate, T.P. \u00a7 14-843(a) refers to both \u201cinterest and penalties on the taxes\u201d that the owner must pay to redeem the property. Similarly, in connection with a sale declared void by the court, T.P. \u00a7 14-848 expressly requires payment to the holder of the certificate of sale of \u201cthe amount paid to the collector on account of the purchase price of the property sold, with <em>interest </em>at the rate provided in the certificate of tax sale____\u201d (Emphasis added). Significantly, the legislature could have used the term \u201credemption rate,\u201d but it did not do so. In any event, it is clear that the County\u2019s certificate of tax sale provides for payment of \u201cinterest\u201d at the rate of 8% and penalties at the rate of 12%, rather than interest at a single redemption rate of 20%.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">With respect to the statutory attorneys\u2019 fees of $400 per property, appellant\u2019s contention is clearly at odds with the principles of statutory construction. T.P. \u00a7 14-843 expressly states that, <em>\u201con </em>redemption,\u201d the holder of a certificate of sale is entitled to the statutory attorney\u2019s fees. Therefore, redemption is a condition precedent to the obligation to pay the statutory attorney\u2019s fees. Yet, no redemption occurred here. Therefore, there is no statutory entitlement to attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">Moreover in contrast to T.P. \u00a7 14-848, which makes clear that \u201cthe collector\u201d shall repay the tax purchaser if the sale is declared void, T.P. \u00a7 14-843 makes no mention of reimbursement by the collector. Instead, it contemplates payment for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>the itemized expenses by the party seeking to redeem the subject property. Again, that did not happen here.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">IY.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">Although we do not perceive a statutory basis for appellant\u2019s claim of entitlement to the redemption rate of interest, we agree with appellant\u2019s alternative argument that, based on the principles of equitable estoppel, it was entitled to recover interest from the County at the rate of 8%. Because the County represented in its notice of sale that it would pay interest at 8% in regard to any invalid sales, the circuit court erred in concluding that appellant had to reimburse the County for the 8% interest that the County had previously paid to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">In its ruling, the circuit court concluded not only that there was no authority under the tax sale statute by which appellant was entitled to payment of interest from the County, but also that the doctrine of equitable estoppel did not apply to the County. In appellant\u2019s view, \u201cit would be inconsistent with equity and good conscience and result in unjust enrichment of the County to require Heartwood to return such funds.\u201d Appellant states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-7\">Heartwood paid a valuable consideration, $1,276,522.42 and the County used those funds for many months before returning them to Heartwood. The interest paid to Heartwood by the County represents both a payment for the County\u2019s use of Heartwood\u2019s funds as well as compensation for Heartwood\u2019s inability to realize the expected return on those funds, that is, the redemption rate of interest which would have been paid by property owners on redemption. The County responds that equitable estoppel does not apply</blockquote>\n<p id=\"An6\">\u201cto situations in which a government entity misinterprets a clear law.\u201d Rather, it asserts that equitable estoppel applies only \u201cwhen a misconstrued provision is ambiguous or when a party has acquired vested rights.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Appellee maintains that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>because \u201cHeartwood knew the risks associated with purchase of property at tax sale,\u201d Heartwood \u201ccannot realistically argue that the Legislature intended a profit in these unusual circumstances.\u201d Further, it states: \u201cThe applicable statute neither mentions this particular situation nor specifies that interest should accompany the refund to the purchaser. Under applicable common law principles, the County had to return only the purchase price and the high-bid premium to Heartwood.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">In <em>Mona Elec. Co. v. Shelton, </em>377 Md. 320, 334, 833 A.2d 527 (2003), the Court of Appeals defined equitable estoppel as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-5\">[EJquitable estoppel [is] \u201cthe effect of the voluntary conduct of a party whereby he is absolutely precluded, both at law and in equity, from asserting rights which might perhaps have otherwise existed, either of property, of contract, or of remedy, as against another person, who has in good faith relied upon such conduct, and has been led thereby to change his position for the worse, and who on his part acquires some corresponding right, either of property, of contract, or of remedy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">(Citations omitted). <em>See also Jurgensen v.

It necessarily implies prejudicial reliance of the insured upon some act, conduct, or nonaction of the insurer.\u201d). A party asserting the benefit of an estoppel \u201cmust have been misled to his injury and have changed his position for the worse, having believed and relied on the representations of the party sought to be estopped.\u201d <em>Rubinstein v.

As the <em>Inlet </em>Court explained, 313 Md. at 437, 545 A.2d 1296, a party \u201c \u2018dealing with officers and agents of a municipality is charged with knowledge of the nature of their duties and the extent of their powers ... \u2019\u201d Therefore, \u201csuch a person cannot be considered to have been deceived or misled by their acts when done without legal authority.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In that circumstance, the doctrine of equitable estoppel cannot \u201c \u2018defeat the municipality in the enforcement of its ordinances,\u2019 \u201d or in its \u201crequired adherence to the provisions of its charter,\u201d merely because of \u201c \u2018an error or mistake committed by one of its officers or agents....\u201d\u2019 <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). <em>See Gontrum, </em>182 Md. at 378, 35 A.2d 128 (stating that \u201cno estoppel as applied to a municipal corporation can grow out of dealings with public officers of limited authority where such authority has been exceeded, or where the acts of its officers and agents were unauthorized or wrongful.\u201d); <em>Lipsitz v. Parr, </em>164 Md. 222, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>227-28, 164 A. 743 (1933); <em>Alternatives, </em>155 Md.App. at 424-429, 463-66, 843 A.2d 252.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">We explained in <em>Anne Arundel County v. Muir, </em>149 Md. App. 617, 817 A.2d 938 (2003), that, with respect to equitable estoppel in regard to a municipality, \u201c \u2018there must have been some positive acts by such officers that have induced the action of the adverse party\u2019 and \u2018[i]t must appear ... that the party asserting the doctrine incurred a substantial change of position or made extensive expenditures in reliance on the act.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 636, 817 A.2d 938 (citation omitted). Again, we recognized that estoppel may apply to municipalities, stating, <em>id. </em>at 636-37, 817 A.2d 938:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-5\">A municipality may be estopped to deny the actions of its officers when they were taken within the scope and course of their actual authority. <em>Lipsitz v. Parr, </em>164 Md. 222, 227, 164 A. 743 (1933). <em>See also Marzullo v. Kahl, </em>366 Md. 158, 196, 783 A.2d 169 (2001); <em>Inlet Assocs. v. Assateague House Condo.

On the other hand, estoppel will not apply to an act of a municipal corporation\u2019s officer that is outside his actual authority, <em>see Gregg Neck Yacht Club v. Co. Comm\u2019rs of Kent County, </em>137 Md.App. at 775, 769 A.2d 982; <em>see also Maryland Classified Employees Assoc. v.

But, the acceptance of its terms through bidding resulted in an executory contract; the terms of sale contained in the advertisement became part of the sale contract. <em>White v. Simard, </em>152 Md.App. 229, 244-45, 831 A.2d 517 (2003). <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number><em>also Donald v. Chaney, </em>302 Md. 465, 477-78, 488 A.2d 971 (1985)(in foreclosure sale, terms of sale contained in advertisement of sale became binding and enforceable upon ratification); <em>Restatement (Second) of Contracts (\u201cRestatement\u201d) </em>\u00a7 28(2) (1981)(\u201cUnless a contrary intention is manifested, bids at an auction embody terms made known by advertisement, posting or other publication of which bidders are or should be aware, as modified by any announcement made by the auctioneer when the goods are put up\u201d). By bidding on the property at the public sale, a bidder \u201coffers\u201d to purchase the property under the express terms advertised by the director of finance. In other words,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-4\">\u201cbidders are or should be aware of terms ... published or announced. A bid need not repeat such termfs]; it is understood as embodying them. Hence the bidder is held to the published or announced terms even though he may have neglected to read them or may have arrived at the auction after the announcement was made.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-5\"><em>Simard, </em>152 Md.App. at 245, 831 A.2d 517 <em>(quoting Restatement </em>\u00a7 28 cmt. e).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">Thus, by agreeing to purchase almost 1,900 properties in 24 groups, Heartwood accepted the terms of the advertisement. Significantly, the County has never claimed that any of its agents exceeded their actual authority in regard to the terms of the sale by stating in the advertisement that, \u201c[i]n the event a tax sale is subsequently invalidated, the tax sale purchaser, upon the surrender of the Tax Sale Certificate, will receive a refund of the amount paid at tax sale, including interest calculated at <em>8%.\u201d </em>To the contrary, it contends that equitable estoppel does not apply when \u201ca government entity misinterprets a clear law. Rather, the doctrine applies only when a misconstrued provision is ambiguous or when a party has acquired vested rights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">The County asserts it misinterpreted a \u201cclear\u201d law. In our view, the law was hardly clear. In electing to do business with the County, which would inure to the benefit of appellant and the County, Heartwood relied upon the County\u2019s repre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>sentations that invalidated sales would yield interest of <em>8% </em>to tax purchasers. Those representations were consistent with the County\u2019s prior conduct and were made within the scope of authority. Indeed, Wyman acknowledged that, in previous cases where property was sold in error, the County refunded the amount paid at the tax sale, plus interest at 8%.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">In <em>Permanent Financial, </em>308 Md. at 241, 518 A.2d 123, Montgomery County issued a building permit for an office building in Silver Spring. Almost nine months later, after the shell of the building was- complete, the County \u201csuspended the building permit and issued a stop work order on the grounds that the building violated statutory height limitations, set-back requirements, and floor area ratio restrictions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 241-42, 518 A.2d 123. The developer appealed to the County Board of Appeals and applied for an exemption, but the Board denied relief. <em>Id. </em>at 242, 518 A.2d 123. We affirmed, but the Court of Appeals reversed. <em>Id. </em>It stated that two reasonable explanations existed regarding the definition of \u201cnonhabitable structures,\u201d and the County\u2019s practice at the time the disagreement arose conformed to the appellant\u2019s interpretation of \u201cnonhabi-table structures.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 251, 518 A.2d 123. The Court held that because the County had been allowing builders to continue pursuant to appellant\u2019s definition of \u201cnonhabitable structures,\u201d principles of equitable estoppel barred the County from requiring Permanent Financial to remove the building\u2019s additional story. <em>Id. </em>at 252, 518 A.2d 123.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">We believe the same rationale applies here. Therefore, we conclude that the County is estopped from refusing to pay the 8% interest on the invalid tax sales.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">At the end of the court\u2019s eight page Opinion and Order of December 18, 2002, the court ordered appellant to return the interest previously paid by appellee and declared that appellant was not entitled to a return on the failed tax purchase. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>However, the circuit court did not issue a separate Declaratory Judgment.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">The appellate courts have repeatedly said that, \u201c \u2018when a declaratory judgment action is brought, and the controversy is appropriate for resolution by declaratory judgment, \u201cthe trial court must render a declaratory judgment.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Information Systems and Network Corp. v.

Woodfin Equities Corp., </em>344 Md. 399, 414, 687 A.2d 652 (1997)) (quoting <em>Christ by Christ v. Maryland Dep\u2019t. of Natural Res., </em>335 Md. 427, 435, 644 A.2d 34 (1994)). In <em>Woodfin, </em>344 Md. at 414-15, 687 A.2d 652, the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-5\">\u201c[WJhere a party requests a declaratory judgment, it is error for a trial court to dispose of the case simply with oral rulings and a grant of ... judgment in favor of the prevailing party.\u201d <em>Ashton v. Brown, </em>339 Md. 70, 87, 660 A.2d 447 (1995), and cases there cited.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-6\">The fact that the side which requested the declaratory judgment did not prevail in the circuit court does not render a written declaration of the parties\u2019 rights unnecessary. As this Court stated many years ago, \u201cwhether a declaratory judgment action is decided for or against the plaintiff, there should be a declaration in the judgment or decree defining the rights of the parties under the issues made.\u201d <em>Case v. Comptroller, </em>219 Md. 282, 288, 149 A.2d 6 (1959). <em>See also, e.g., Christ v.

This is not just a matter of complying with a hypertechnical rule.

In its brief, the County expressly accepted appellant\u2019s version of the facts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b363-9\">. As the County explained in its notice of tax sale, the \"high bid premium\u201d is refunded to the holder of the tax sale certificate \"on redemption of the property or to the plaintiff in an action to foreclose the right of redemption or delivery of a tax sale deed for the property for which the high-bid premium was paid.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b364-7\">. Appellant does not challenge the County\u2019s failure to pay interest on the high-bid premium. See T.P. \u00a7 14-817(b)(2)(v).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b364-8\">. Prior to the institution of suit, the County agreed that it was not necessary for appellant to join the property owners as parties. In a letter of July 20, 2001, to counsel for Heartwood, the County said:</p>\n<p id=\"b364-9\">[W]e accept your offer to bring a single action in which only the County (and not the record title holders) would be joined as a defendant. The County agrees that it will not raise as a defense in any such suit that the record title owners have not been joined as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>parties and that more than ten certificates have been joined in a single proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">The parties have not identified Firestine as a party to this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b373-8\">. The County admitted in its answers to interrogatories that its redemption rate is 20%. Moreover, when payment was made by the owners of the 331 properties, the County collected interest at 8% and the penalty of 12% on the taxes in arrears. <em>See </em>T.P. \u00a7\u00a7 14-605 (interest); T.P. \u00a7\u00a7 14-702 and 14-703 (tax penalty) and Montgomery County Code \u00a7 52-2(h) (\u201cOrdinary taxes when overdue are subject to interest at the rate specified in state law. In addition to interest, taxes are also subject to a penalty at the rate established by resolution of the County Council\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b373-9\">. As appellant points out, a redemption rate of 20% is not really tantamount to a return of 20%. The effective rate of interest for a tax sale purchaser is less than the redemption rate, because the General Assembly amended T.P. \u00a7 14-817(b) to permit counties to require tax sale purchasers to pay, in addition to the unpaid taxes, interest, and penalties, an interest-free \"high-bid premium.\u201d The premium is equal to \"20% of the amount by which the highest bid exceeds $40% of the property's full cash value.\" T.P. \u00a7 14\u2014817(b)(2)(ii). Upon redemption, the County refunds the high-bid premium, but <em>without interest. </em>T.P. \u00a7 14\u2014817(b)(2)(v). As appellant explains, \"[t]his required interest-free posting has the effect of significantly reducing the investor\u2019s overall rate of return, while providing the County with additional capital at no cost, which the County either employs in its operations or reinvests.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b387-8\">. We need not decide whether T.P. \u00a7 14-848 would have applied if it had been necessary for the parties or the property owners to seek a judicial determination declaring that the sales were void. That case simply is not before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b389-8\">. Appellant points out that the County claimed below that appellant could not recover based on the theory ol unjust enrichment, but did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>argue that equitable estoppel is inapplicable to the County. Appellant advanced an equitable estoppel claim, however, and the court considered the issue. Therefore, we shall address it. In contrast, because the County has not pursued its unjust enrichment claim on appeal, we decline to consider that issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b397-7\">. On February 3, 2004, this Court remanded the case to the circuit court for entry of a separate judgment consistent with the requirements of Maryland Rule 2-601(a). On March 4, 2004, the circuit court issued an Order that, <em>inter alia, </em>entered judgment in favor of Montgomery County in the amount of $83,621.22 and denied appellant\u2019s claim for interest at the redemption rate. Unfortunately, in our Order, we did not specifically point out the circuit court\u2019s failure to issue a declaratory judgment, and that omission was not cured by the circuit court\u2019s Order of March 4, 2004.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
