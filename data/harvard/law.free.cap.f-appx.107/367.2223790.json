He contends on appeal that the district court erred in assigning him one criminal history point, pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 4A1.1(c)(1) (2002), for a prior seven-day West Virginia sentence for fleeing on foot from a law enforcement officer.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because the offense of fleeing is similar to an offense listed in \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(1), we vacate Sanders\u2019 sentence and remand for resentencing. We grant Sanders\u2019 motion for leave to file a supplemental brief addressing the effect on his sentence of <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). We deem the motion to be the supplemental brief, and we conclude that the <em>Blakely </em>claim is without merit. <em>See United States v. Hammoud, </em>No. 03-4253, 2004 WL 1730309 (4th Cir. Aug.2, 2004) (order).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-17\">\u201cThe Guidelines create a general presumption that all prior sentences within the applicable time period will be included in calculating a defendant\u2019s criminal history category.\u201d <em>United States v. Harris, </em>128 F.3d 850, 853 (4th Cir.1997). An exception is made for sentences for misdemeanor and petty offenses that are listed in USSG \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(l) or are similar to a listed offense. Sentences for these offenses are counted only if (1) the prior sentence was a term of at least one year of probation or thirty days imprisonment, or (2) the prior offense was similar to the instant offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-18\">In the district court, Sanders maintained that his prior conviction for fleeing was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>similar to resisting arrest and to providing false information to a police officer; both are offenses listed in \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(l). The district court rejected his argument. We review the district court\u2019s legal determination de novo. <em>United States v. </em>Caplinger; 339 F.3d 226, 233 (4th Cir.2003). In this appeal, Sanders again argues that fleeing is similar to the listed offenses of resisting arrest and argues for the first time that it is similar to \u201chindering or failure to obey a police officer,\u201d which is also a listed offense. We conclude that fleeing and \u201chindering or failure to obey a police officer\u201d are similar offenses;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> thus, we do not consider Sanders\u2019 argument concerning the offense of resisting arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">In <em>Hams, </em>we adopted a \u201csimilar elements\u201d test for determining whether two offenses are similar under \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(l). We look to West Virginia law for the elements of the predicate offense of fleeing and to federal law for the elements of the listed offense and the ultimate determination of similarity. <em>United States v. Tigney, </em>367 F.3d 200, 202 (4th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">The elements of the West Virginia offense of fleeing are that (1) the defendant intentionally flees by means other than a vehicle (2) from a law enforcement officer acting in his or her official capacity who is attempting to make a lawful arrest (3) with knowledge (or reason to know) that the law enforcement officer is attempting to arrest him or her. W. Va.Code Ann. \u00a7 61-5-17(d) (Michie Supp.2003). A defendant hinders or fails to obey a police officer under federal law if he (1) fails to comply (2) with a lawful order (3) issued by a police officer. <em>Tigney, </em>367 F.3d at 202 n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">Although there is some difference between the elements of these offenses, under <em>Hams </em>we need only find that the elements are \u201cnearly corresponding\u201d or \u201cresembling in many respects.\u201d 128 F.3d at 854. We conclude that the essential elements of fleeing and \u201chindering or failure to obey a police officer\u201d sufficiently resemble each other that Sanders\u2019 sentence for fleeing was excludable under \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-10\">Consequently, Sanders\u2019 sentence for fleeing should not have been counted toward his criminal history score.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-11\">We therefore vacate the sentence imposed by the district court and remand for resentencing in accord with this opinion. We grant Sanders\u2019 motion to file a supplemental brief addressing <em>Blakely </em>and we deny the <em>Blakely </em>claim. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-12\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b406-11\">. The misdemeanor offense of non-vehicular flight from a law enforcement officer is currently set out in W. Va.Code Ann. \u00a7 61-5-17(d). (Michie 2000 &amp; LexisNexis Supp. 2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b407-8\">. Although Sanders did not make this particular claim in the district court, we may consider it because he preserved for appeal the question of whether a criminal history point was properly awarded for his fleeing sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
