(\u201cBarko\u201d) manufactures large and expensive machines called \u201cfeller-bunchers.\u201d Used in the logging industry, feller-bunchers utilize saws to shear off trees near their base and metal arms to stack the logs on the ground. C.W. Wattle (\u201cWattle\u201d), a veteran logger with 30 years of experience, purchased a feller-buncher from Barko in 1998. Soon after the purchase, Wattle was operating the feller-buncher when it caught on fire, destroying much of the machine. Wattle sued Barko for breach of various warranties. After a three-day trial, during which experts testified on the cause of the fire and the value of the fellerbuncher, the jury returned a verdict for Wattle. Barko moved the district court for judgment as a matter of law and for a new trial. Both motions were denied, Barko appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-15\">We must affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Barko\u2019s motion for a new trial unless there is a \u201cclear showing of an abuse of discretion\u201d by the district court. <em>Hidden Oaks Ltd. v. City of Austin, </em>138 F.3d 1036, 1049 (5th Cir.1998). Barko argues that the district court abused its discretion by allowing the submission of expert opinions,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> after the close of discovery, from Jim Swain (\u201cSwain\u201d) and Dan Olsen (\u201cOlsen\u201d) \u2014 both of whom testified as to the cause and origin of the fire. In particular, Barko claims that it was prejudiced by the late-designated experts. <em>See Campbell v. Keystone Aerial Surveys, </em>138 F.3d 996 (5th Cir.1998); <em>Bradley v. U.S., </em>866 F.2d 120 (5th Cir.1989). In the cases Barko relies on, the parties were prejudiced because they lacked adequate time to prepare for the expert witnesses; here, however, Barko had ample opportunity to prepare \u2014 Swain and Olsen were designated by Wattle over a year before trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-16\">Barko also asserts that Olsen\u2019s testimony was neither relevant nor reliable, two requirements for admission of expert testimony. <em>See Daubert v. Merrell Dow Phar</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number><em>maceuticals, Inc., </em>509 U.S. 579, 592, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469 (1993). The district court concluded, based on Olsen\u2019s professional background, the scope of his investigation, and the methodology of his report, that Olsen\u2019s report was reliable. Barko fails to rebut these findings, instead offering arguments that conflate the reliability of the report with its <em>correctness. </em>But as this Court has noted, under <em>Daubert </em>one \u201cneed not prove to the judge that the expert\u2019s testimony is correct.\u201d <em>Moore v. Ashland Chemical Inc., </em>151 F.3d 269, 276 (5th Cir.1998). The district court did not abuse its discretion, and accordingly we will not overturn its denial of Barko\u2019s motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">Barko also claims that he deserves judgment as a matter of law. We review the district court\u2019s ruling on a motion for judgment as a matter of law <em>de novo. See, e.g., Mississippi Chemical Corp. v. Dresser-Rand Co., </em>287 F.3d 359, 365 (5th Cir. 2002). A judgment as a matter of law is granted by the district court if \u201cthere is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find\u201d for Wattle. Fed. R.Civ.P. 50(a); <em>Whitehead v. Food Max of Mississippi, Inc., </em>163 F.3d 265, 269 (5th Cir.1998). Barko relies exclusively on <em>Coursey v. Broadhurst, </em>888 F.2d 338 (5th Cir.1989). In <em>Coursey, </em>the plaintiff failed to submit any proof of the after-value for the tractor of his damaged tractor-trailer, and the plaintiff lost his appeal because of that omission. Barko asserts that <em>Coursey </em>requires this Court to separate a product into its component parts and the parties to offer proof of damage for each component. Specifically, Barko argues that the saw-head and the rest of the feller-buncher were in fact two separate entities, and that Wattle\u2019s failure to offer proof of damage to the sawhead alone entitles Barko to judgment as a matter of law. There is no language in <em>Coursey, </em>however, to support Barko\u2019s contention. The court there was faced with the limited question of sufficiency of proof vis-\u00e1-vis the tractor \u2014 the question of trailer damages was not appealed\u2014 and did not face the questions of first, whether the trailer was part of the tractor or vice versa, or second, whether proof of damage to the tractor-trailer was sufficient for the tractor alone.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Barko\u2019s reliance on <em>Coursey </em>is thus misguided and the district court was correct to find that the proof of damages for the whole feller-buncher was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b435-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b435-13\">. Barko has two other complaints regarding witnesses. First, Barko argues that Wattle inappropriately testified to the after-value of the feller-buncher, an argument without merit considering Wattle did not testify <em>at all </em>about the after-value of the feller-buncher. Second, Barko asserts that the testimony of another witness on the issue of damages, Dexter Meredith, was prejudicial because Barko \"had no idea\u201d about the contents of Meredith\u2019s opinions. The evidence does not support Barko's claim: Meredith was listed as a witness on the pretrial order and his background as a claims adjuster was also disclosed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b436-5\">. We also reject Barko\u2019s objection to the jury instructions because the objection was premised on this faulty separation claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
