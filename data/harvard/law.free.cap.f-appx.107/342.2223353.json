Edwards appeals the district court\u2019s order granting Defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss Edwards\u2019 claims under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (\u201cADEA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 621 <em>et seq., </em>and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>Americans with Disabilities Act (\u201cADA\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12101-12213 (2000). Edwards also appeals the dismissal of his intentional infliction of emotional distress claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">Because the district court considered materials outside the parties\u2019 pleadings, we construe its action in granting Appellees\u2019 motions as granting summary judgment. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 12(b). In reviewing an appeal from a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, this court conducts a review de novo, assessing whether there is a genuine question of material fact, drawing all factual contentions and justifiable inferences to favor the nonmovant. <em>See, e.g., Brinkley v. Harbour Recreation Club, </em>180 F.3d 598, 606 (4th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">We agree with the district court that Edwards\u2019 ADEA claims are procedurally barred. <em>See Dennis v. County of Fairfax, </em>55 F.3d 151, 156 (4th Cir.1995) (holding that claims that exceed scope of EEOC charge are procedurally barred). We also agree that Edwards failed to present a prima facie claim of discrimination under the ADA. <em>See Haulbrook v. Michelin N. America, </em>252 F.3d 696, 702 (4th Cir.2001) (stating elements that comprise a prima facie case of discrimination under the ADA). Finally, we agree that Edwards\u2019 allegations of intentional infliction of emotional distress failed to rise to the level of an actionable claim. <em>See Harris v. Jones, </em>281 Md. 560, 380 A.2d 611, 614 (1977) (stating Maryland state law elements claimant must establish to make out a claim for the intentional infliction of emotional distress). Because we find Edwards\u2019 claims either procedurally barred or without merit, we do not reach the question of individual liability under the ADA or the ADEA. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Edwards\u2019 claims. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
