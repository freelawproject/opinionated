Pistenmaa, M.D., appeals the district court\u2019s denial in part of his summary judgment motion asserting a qualified immunity defense to the First Amendment retaliation claims of Suresh Dutta, M.D. The summary judgment evidence revealed two versions of the relevant facts. Dr. Dutta\u2019s version was that his employment contract was not renewed for his assistant professor position because he criticized the hospitals\u2019 disparate treatment of insured patients who could pay for services and uninsured ones who were indigent. Dr. Pistenmaa\u2019s version was that the nonrenewal of Dr. Dutta\u2019s contract was based on Dr. Dutta\u2019s poor work habits, his hostile attitude, and his condescending and disrespectful treatment of staff and faculty members.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>To establish a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 cause of action for a First Amendment claim of retaliation, an employee must show: (1) that he suffered an adverse employment action, (2) as a result of speech involving a matter of public concern, (3) that his interest in commenting on the matter of public concern outweighed the defendant\u2019s interest in promoting efficiency, and (4) that the adverse action was motivated by the protected speech. <em>Foley v. Univ. of Houston Sys., </em>355 F.3d 333, 340 (5th Cir.2003). The district court denied summary judgment on the basis of, <em>inter alia, </em>the fourth factor, i.e., there were genuine issues of fact regarding causation. Because the district court\u2019s decision falls into a non-appealable category, i.e., a genuine issue of fact exists regarding whether the defendant engaged in conduct that violated a clearly established constitutional right, this court lacks jurisdiction to hear this appeal. <em>See Kinney v. Weaver, </em>367 F.3d 337, 346 (5th Cir.2004)(en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">DISMISSED FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b447-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
