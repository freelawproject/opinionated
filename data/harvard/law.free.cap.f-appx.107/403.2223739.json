Davis, </em>531 U.S. 230, 121 S.Ct. 714, 148 L.Ed.2d 635 (2001), was impermissibly applied retroactively to deprive him of eligibility for a one-year reduction in his sentence. Contrary to Clayton\u2019s belief, <em>Lopez </em>did not create a new law that denied him eligibility for early release under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3621(e). Because <em>Lopez </em>merely declared permissible a regulation that had gone into effect prior to Clayton\u2019s conviction, there is no retroactivity issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-11\">Clayton argues that when his sentence was recalculated he acquired a liberty interest in early release and that the subsequent change in his eligibility status for early release violated his due process rights. His claims fail because there is no protected liberty interest in early release under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3621(e). <em>See Rublee v. Fleming, </em>160 F.3d 213, 216 (5th Cir.1998); <em>Venegas v. Henman, </em>126 F.3d 760, 765 (5th Cir.1997). Accordingly, the district court did not err in denying Clayton\u2019s petition, and its judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b442-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
