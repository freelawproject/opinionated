He was sentenced to a total of 360 months\u2019 imprisonment and three years\u2019 supervised release. His conviction for conspiracy was subsequently vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-20\">Through retained counsel, Puma filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion alleging that his conviction and sentence for CCE violated his due process rights pursuant to a right which was newly recognized by the Supreme Court in <em>Richardson v. United States, </em>526 U.S. 813, 119 S.Ct. 1707, 143 L.Ed.2d 985 (1999), and which was made retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review. Citing to <em>United States v. Lopez, </em>248 F.3d 427 (5th Cir.2001), the district court denied Puma\u2019s instant motion because it held that his <em>Richardson </em>claim was procedurally barred, he had failed to show actual prejudice in order to overcome that procedural bar, and he had failed to show that the alleged error would result in a complete miscarriage of justice. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>district court, however, granted a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) as to the following issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-4\">Whether <em>United States v. Lopez </em>... requires a holding in this case that defendant PUMA procedurally defaulted his <em>Richardson </em>... claim. This Court interpreted <em>Lopez </em>to mandate that the <em>Richardson </em>continuing criminal enterprise claim was procedurally defaulted because such issue was not raised on direct appeal. Defendant PUMA\u2019s direct appeal, however, was initiated in May 1990, was decided in July 1991, and <em>Richardson </em>was not decided until 1999.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A4-\">This court\u2019s review is limited to issues for which a COA has been granted. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c); <em>United States v. Kimler, </em>150 F.3d 429, 430 (5th Cir.1998). This court has held that appellate review of uncertified issues is inappropriate where there is no explicit request to broaden the grant of COA. <em>Kimler, </em>150 F.3d at 431 <em>&amp; </em>n. 1. In the instant appeal, Puma has failed to address whether the procedural bar is applicable to his <em>Richardson </em>claim, which was the sole issue for which COA was granted. Moreover, Puma has not specifically requested expansion of the grant of COA to encompass the issues contained in his appeal brief. Puma has thus abandoned the only cognizable issue in the instant appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">Even if Puma had briefed the issue for which COA was granted, his argument would fail. In <em>Lopez, </em>the movant\u2019s conviction became final prior to the issuance of <em>Richardson, </em>but this court nevertheless held that Lopez had procedurally defaulted his <em>Richardson </em>claim by failing to raise it on direct review. 248 F.3d at 429, 433. Accordingly, because the instant case is procedurally identical to <em>Lopez, </em>the procedural bar was applicable to Puma\u2019s <em>Richardson </em>claim because he failed to raise that claim on direct review.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">Finally, Puma has not shown cause or prejudice sufficient to overcome the procedural bar, nor has he shown a complete miscarriage of justice in the resulting conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b475-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
