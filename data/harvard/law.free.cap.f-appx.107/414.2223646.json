He argues that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to investigate and challenge an enhancement in the indictment alleging that the offense occurred within 1000 feet of a playground; Solis pleaded true to the enhancement at the advice of counsel. The district court found that although counsel\u2019s failure to investigate and challenge was deficient, Solis had not shown prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-11\">In order to obtain relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, Solis must show that the reasoning of the state court \u201cwas contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1). Solis asserts that under Texas law, prejudice is inherent because counsel\u2019s error resulted in an increase in the statutory minimum sentence from five years\u2019 imprisonment to 15 years\u2019 imprisonment. An error in state law is insufficient to warrant habeas relief. <em>Manning v. Warden, Louisiana St. Penitentiary, </em>786 F.2d 710, 711 (5th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-16\">Solis alleges that various state courts use mathematical precision to determine the midpoint range of a guideline sentence and that if the jury had considered the proper range of punishment, it is reasonable to assume that they would have imposed a sentence proportionally below the new midpoint range of the guidelines. Any error in not following the law of another state will not merit habeas relief. <em>Manning, </em>786 F.2d at 711. Although Solis contends that it would not have been an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law for the Texas courts to use a mathematical-precision analysis, he has not established that the <em>failure </em>to do so constituted an unreasonable application either. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-17\">Solis contends that the district court used the wrong standard by requiring him to show that his sentence was increased \u201cdue to\u201d counsel\u2019s error. He maintains that the proper standard under <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 696, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), is that \u201cthe decision reached would reasonably likely have been different absent the error[ ].\u201d Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the district court applied the wrong standard, Solis has not established that he was entitled to habeas relief; he has not shown that it was \u201creasonably likely\u201d that his sentence would have differed.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-18\">Solis also contends that the unreasonable severity of his sentence shows prejudice. Solis has not established that his sentence was wholly unreasonable for the offense he did commit and for his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>criminal history. Consequently, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b453-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
