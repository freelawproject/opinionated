Polan appeals from the district court\u2019s order imposing sanctions against him in the amount of $10,000 plus one-third of certain costs. The sanction resulted from Polan\u2019s failure to properly notify the court, during a proceeding in which he and his father were the defendants, that his father had died and that he was not a co-executor of his father\u2019s estate, as the plaintiffs believed. As a result of these failures, a judgment previously entered in favor of the plaintiffs in the amount of $208,637.50 had to be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-28\">We find that the district court acted within its discretion in imposing sanctions against Polan. <em>See Chambers v. NASCO, Inc., </em>501 U.S. 32, 111 S.Ct. 2123, 115 L.Ed.2d 27 (1991). Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>See Glucksberg v. Polan, </em>No. CA-99-129-3 (S.D.W. Va. June 12, 2003). We deny Polan\u2019s motion for oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
