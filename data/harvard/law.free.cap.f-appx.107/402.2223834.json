Gallagher originally filed his habeas petition in the Eastern District of Louisiana, which transferred it to the Middle District of Louisiana based on the LDPSC\u2019s geographical location in the transferee district. In turn, the transferee district dismissed Gallagher\u2019s petition for lack of jurisdiction because he had neither been convicted and sentenced nor incarcerated there. Gallagher argues on appeal that the Middle District of Louisiana was correct in its jurisdictional ruling and that his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition should be heard in the Eastern District of Louisiana where he had filed it in the first place. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>A prisoner may bring a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition in either the district where he is confined or the district where the state court that convicted and sentenced him is located. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241(d); <em>Carmona v. Andrews, </em>357 F.3d 535, 537-38 (5th Cir.2004). The LDPSC is not a state court, either administratively or for the purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241(d). <em>See </em>La.Rev.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 36:401; <em>Carmona, </em>357 F.3d at 538. As Gallagher was convicted and sentenced in a state court located in the Eastern District of Louisiana and is incarcerated in a state facility likewise located in that district, the Eastern District of Louisiana is the only court with jurisdiction to hear his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition. <em>See id. </em>at 537-39. Accordingly, the judgment of dismissal is affirmed and the case is remanded to the Middle District of Louisiana with instructions to transfer it back to the Eastern District of Louisiana.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">DISMISSAL AFFIRMED; CASE REMANDED with instructions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b440-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
