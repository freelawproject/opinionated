Tex.Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.07 \u00a7 3(a); <em>Grunsfeld v. State, </em>843 S.W.2d 521, 523-26 (Tex.Crim. App.1992); <em>Givens v. Cockrell, </em>265 F.3d 306, 309 n. 3 (5th Cir.2001). Because the sentencing transcript reveals that the court considered Weaver\u2019s testimony in determining Gordon\u2019s sentence, a showing of prejudice is not precluded. <em>See Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 689-94, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). However, the portion of the sentencing transcript containing Weaver\u2019s testimony and any objections thereto is not part of the record in this court. Thus, it is impossible for this court to determine whether Gordon can satisfy the deficient-performance-prong of <em>Strickland </em>by showing that counsel failed to object to the introduction of Weaver\u2019s testimony. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b443-19\">The respondent reasserts the time-bar as a basis for denying relief. The two cases relied on by the district court in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>denying the respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss Gordon\u2019s petition as time-barred are distinguishable from the instant case. See <em>Emerson v. Johnson, </em>243 F.3d 931, 934-35 (5th Cir.2001); <em>Lookingbill v. Cockrell, </em>293 F.3d 256, 261 (5th Cir.2002), <em>cert. denied, </em>537 U.S. 1116, 123 S.Ct. 878, 154 L.Ed.2d 793 (2003). In both cases, after the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals (TCCA) denied state habeas relief, the petitioner filed, within the one-year period of \u00a7 2244(d), a motion to reconsider. <em>See Emerson, </em>243 F.3d at 932, 935-36; <em>Lookingbill, </em>293 F.3d at 261. In the instant case, Gordon did not file his motion for reconsideration until May 17, 2002, after the one-year period had expired. Thus, Gordon\u2019s petition arguably was untimely unless the late notice from the TCCA of the denial of state habeas relief provided a basis for equitable tolling.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">Gordon asserted that he received the TCCA\u2019s notice of the denial of habeas relief on March 15, 2002. He did not file his \u00a7 2254 petition until two months later, on May 14, 2002. This court has indicated that a one-month delay in filing a \u00a7 2254 petition after notice from the state court of the denial of relief does not preclude equitable tolling, but a four-month delay does. <em>Melancon v. Kaylo, </em>259 F.3d 401, 408 (5th Cir.2001); <em>Phillips v. Donnelly, </em>216 F.3d 508, 511 (5th Cir.), <em>modified on reh\u2019g, </em>223 F.3d 797 (2000). See also <em>Simmons v. Johnson, </em>No. 98-21054, 210 F.3d 368, 2000 WL 293959 (5th Cir. Feb. 17, 2000)(unpub-lished). (Equitable tolling not warranted where petitioner waited more than one month after receiving notice of the denial of state post conviction relief to file his \u00a7 2254 petition.)</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s denial of Gordon\u2019s claim that counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the introduction of Weaver\u2019s testimony is VACATED, and this case is REMANDED for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b443-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
