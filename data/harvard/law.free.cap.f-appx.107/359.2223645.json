An individual seeking to file a \u201csecond or successive\u201d motion for collateral relief must first move in the court of appeals for an order directing the district court to consider his motion. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A) (2000). \u201cThe court of appeals may authorize the filing of a second or successive application only if it determines that the application makes a prima facie showing that the application satisfies the requirements of [\u00a7 2244(b) ].\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(C). This requirement also applies to motions made under Rule 60(b) where permitting the movant to proceed without authorization under \u00a7 2244 would allow him to \u201cevade the bar against relitigation of claims presented in a prior application.\u201d <em>United State v. Winestock, </em>340 F.3d 200, 203 (4th Cir.2003). In this matter, Harris failed to seek authorization from this court to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. Accordingly, the district court was without jurisdiction to consider the claims, and it properly dismissed the motion. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b397-24\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b397-18\"> To the extent Harris\u2019 notice of appeal and informal brief could be construed as an application for authorization under \u00a7 2244, we deny authorization because Harris does not allege newly discovered evidence or a new rule of constitutional law made retroactively applicable by the Supreme Court to cases on collateral review. <em>See Winestock, </em>340 F.3d at 208.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
