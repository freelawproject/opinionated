We conclude we lack jurisdiction to review this claim. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-21\">While we do not have jurisdiction to consider the Board\u2019s denial of Gan\u2019s asylum claim, we retain jurisdiction to consider the denial of her request for withholding of removal, which is not subject to the one-year time limitation. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.4(a) (2004). \u201cTo qualify for withholding of removal, a petitioner must show that [s]he faces a clear probability of persecution because of h[er] race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d <em>Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 324 n. 13 (4th Cir.2002) (citing <em>INS v. Stevic, </em>467 U.S. 407, 430, 104 S.Ct. 2489, 81 L.Ed.2d 321 (1984)). Based on our review of the record, we conclude substantial evidence supports the finding that Gan has failed to meet this standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-22\">Accordingly, we dismiss the petition for review in part and deny it in part. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-23\">\n<em>PETITION DISMISSED IN PART; DENIED IN PART</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
