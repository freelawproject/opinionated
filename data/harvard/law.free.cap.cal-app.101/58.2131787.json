The complaint set up three causes of action, the first alleging the performance by plaintiff of legal services of the reasonable value of $2,145.42, of which sum $319.75 had been paid, the second an open, mutual and current account and the third an account stated. The answer consisted of specific denials as to each cause of action, and as a separate defense \u201cand by way of counterclaim\u201d it set up alleged negligence on the part of respondent while acting as appellant\u2019s attorney, claiming that by reason thereof the latter had been damaged in the amount of $2,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-9\">The court found that the services had been rendered and were reasonably worth $1,030 and that $304.30 of that sum had been paid, leaving a balance due of $725.67. With this finding appellant has no quarrel except that he points out an obvious error in the figures, the complaint having admitted a credit of $319.75, which would make the balance due $710.25. Respondent concedes this point. A reversal is sought by appellant for reasons which we shall discuss <em>seriatim.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b92-10\">The first contention advanced has to do with the allowance of interest on the sum found due, amounting to $163. The finding of indebtedness was solely upon the cause of action pleading a <em>quantum meruit. </em>There was therefore no support for the finding that \u201csaid sum of $725.67 became due and payable on the 17th day of February, 1923, and that plaintiff is entitled to have and recover interest on said sum from said date.\u201d \u201cIn an action to recover the reasonable value of services performed by a plaintiff, the amount, character and value of which can only be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>established by evidence in court . . . the plaintiff is not entitled to interest prior to verdict or judgment.\u201d <em>(Swinnerton </em>v. <em>Argonaut Land etc. Co., </em>112 Cal. 375 [44 Pac. 719, 720]; <em>Cox </em>v. <em>McLaughlin, </em>76 Cal. 60 [9 Am. St. Rep. 164, 18 Pac. 100]; <em>Erickson </em>v. <em>Stockton &amp; T. C. R. Co., </em>148 Cal. 206 [82 Pac. 961]; <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Arp, </em>173 Cal. 472 [160 Pac. 551].)  While we are in accord with appellant\u2019s contention that interest should not have been allowed, the error in including it is not one in itself necessitating a reversal but is one which may be corrected by a modification of the judgment to that extent. <em>(Fox </em>v. <em>Hale &amp; Norcross Silver Min. Co., </em>122 Cal. 219 [54 Pac. 731], <em>Supreme Lodge </em>v. <em>Los Angeles Lodge, </em>177 Cal. 132 [169 Pac. 1040], and <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Arp, supra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">We glean from the ill-prepared record before us that the court below attempted to cure this error as well as that in the computation of the credit due to appellant, since we find in \u201cPlaintiff\u2019s Bill of Exceptions\u201d (but not elsewhere in the transcript) reference to an order denying a motion for new trial \u201cupon plaintiff\u2019s failing consent to a reduction of judgment as follows: $163.00 interest as of date of entry of judgment, $15.45 error in computation of credits\u201d and providing that \u201cunless such consent is filed in five days after notice of this order, motion for new trial is granted.\u201d But as to whether or not such consent was filed or as to the date of the order, the record before us is silent.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">Appellant\u2019s second point is that the court failed to find on the issues presented by the counterclaim (which appellant also refers to as a cross-complaint) and the answer thereto. The only finding as to the counterclaim is as follows: \u201cThe court further finds that all the allegations contained in the complaint of the plaintiff, the answer and counterclaim, or cross-complaint of the defendant, and the answer of the plaintiff to counterclaim, or cross-complaint of defendant, inconsistent with the foregoing findings of fact are untrue.\u201d This is not sufficient as a finding. The allegations of the counterclaim as to respondent\u2019s alleged negligence and the damage to appellant caused thereby are not necessarily inconsistent with the fact of rendition of legal services by respondent and the indebtedness of appellant therefor. Findings of fact should be definite and certain. <em>(De Cou </em>v. <em>Howell, </em>190 Cal. 741 [214 Pac. 444]; <em>Chambers</em></p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>v. <em>Gibson, </em>178 Cal. 416 [173 Pac. 752].) A finding similar to that above quoted was thus criticised in <em>Goodnow </em>v. <em>Griswold, </em>68 Cal. 599 [9 Pac. 837] : \u201cThe court below found: \u2018The court finds that the several allegations of said complaint not in conflict with the foregoing findings are true. \u2019 We are not informed which of the other findings were, in the opinion of the court below, in conflict with the findings referred to as the \u2018 foregoing findings. \u2019 In <em>Harlan </em>v. <em>Ely, </em>55 Cal. 340, a finding \u2018all and singular the allegations of the amended answer are untrue, except so far as the same accord with the foregoing facts, \u2019 was held insufficient. This court there said: \u2018The court below should have assumed the labor of comparing the allegations of the answer with the facts by it found; as it is, we are not informed which of the allegations of the answer were, in the opinion of the court below, true, which untrue. We cannot assume the function of determining for the first time the truth or falsity of any of them, either by reference to the testimony or to the facts actually found. \u2019 The finding here is subject to a like objection, and on the authority of <em>Harlan </em>v. <em>Ely </em>the judgment and order should be reversed. \u2019 \u2019 Mr. Justice Thornton in a concurring opinion in the same case said: \u2018 \u2018 The court finds that several matters are not true, and then proceeds to find that the several allegations of said complaint not in conflict with the foregoing findings are true. This is not in accordance with the statute (Code Civ. Proc., sec. 632), which requires the court below to find facts. Such duty is not imposed on this court. The court below must find facts and place them in its decision, so that this court may see when an appeal is taken, what facts the lower court has found, and whether the correct judgment has been pronounced on them. This court is not called on to determine what allegations of a complaint are not in conflict with certain matters found not to be true.\u201d See, also, <em>Perkins </em>v. <em>West Coast Lbr. Co., </em>5 Cal; Unrep. 674 [40 Pac. 982],</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">Appellant earnestly asserts that \u201csufficient evidence was produced by the defendant to establish a <em>prima facie </em>claim for damages on account of the defendant\u2019s counterclaim or cross-complaint, which said damages were not found by the court,\u201d and that if there had been a finding on the issues presented by the counterclaim the amount of respondent\u2019s recovery would inevitably have been diminished if not en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>tirely eliminated. He also complains of numerous rulings of the trial court on questions of the admission or exclusion of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">Respondent with equal fervor contends that the counterclaim fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a counterclaim or cause of action, that there was no evidence which would have justified or supported a finding in appellant\u2019s favor, and hence that this is a proper case for the application of the rule that failure to find upon an issue raised by answer or cross-complaint is not reversible error where, if the finding had been made, it would necessarily have been adverse to the appellant. <em>(Reveal </em>v. <em>Stell, </em>56 Cal. App. 463 [205 Pac. 875] ; <em>Cross </em>v. <em>Thiele, </em>51 Cal. App. 780 [197 Pac. 974] ; <em>Llano Inv. Co. </em>v. <em>Minton, </em>190 Cal. 752 [214 Pac. 855].)</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">We think the counterclaim, while somewhat carelessly drafted, contained sufficient facts to raise an issue as to respondent\u2019s alleged negligence and appellant\u2019s claim of loss therefrom. Stripped of its unessentials it alleges that \u201cas such attorney the plaintiff counseled and advised with defendant and represented defendant in certain collection cases\u201d; that \u201cthe advice and counsel given by plaintiff was wrongful . . . and that the plaintiff was careless and negligent in the handling of defendant\u2019s affairs,\u201d and that by reason of this defendant was subjected to a series of criminal and civil actions, to his loss and damage in the sum of $2,000.  This was a sufficient pleading of negligence, which may be alleged in general terms without specifying the particular act or omission which rendered the conduct negligent. <em>(Stein </em>v. <em>United Railroads, </em>159 Cal. 368 [113 Pac. 663] ; <em>Mathes </em>v. <em>Aggeler &amp; Musser Seed Co., </em>179 Cal. 697 [178 Pac. 713].)</p>\n<p id=\"b95-9\">The questions as to the sufficiency, or lack, of evidence relating to the issues tendered by appellant\u2019s pleadings, as well as those having t\u00f3 do with the trial court\u2019s rulings on evidence, we are precluded from considering on this appeal by reason of the condition of the record before us. The appeal is taken under the original method, which requires the preparation and inclusion in the record of a bill of exceptions when it is sought to review the evidence and the rulings thereon. (Sec. 950, Code Civ. Proc.) The requirements as to the contents of such a bill, the time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>within which it must be served on the adverse party, the time and method of proposing amendments thereto and of presentation thereof to the court for settlement are set forth in section 650 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which further provides that after settlement of the bill of exceptions by the trial judge \u201cthe bill must thereupon be engrossed and presented to the judge to be certified, by the party presenting it, within ten days.\u201d There are few, if any, of the requirements of this section which appear to have been complied with in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">The transcript on appeal, in addition to the judgment-roll which shows that the judgment appealed from was entered May 10, 1926, and that the notice of appeal was filed May 17, 1926 (there is no indication of service thereof on the respondent), contains two documents styled respectively \u201cBill of Exceptions\u201d and \u201cPlaintiff\u2019s Amendments to Defendant\u2019s Bill of Exceptions.\u201d These are followed in the transcript by an order reading as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-6\">\u201cIt is hereby ordered that the foregoing Bill of Exceptions and Amendments thereto be, and the same is hereby settled and approved and I hereby certify that the same constitutes the Bill of Exceptions on appeal herein of the defendants therein named.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-7\">\u201cDated: October 28th, 1926.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-8\">\u201cP. E. Keeler,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-9\">\u201cJudge of the Superior Court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Agq\">The \u201cBill of Exceptions\u201d is signed by counsel for appellant but is accompanied by no proof, by affidavit of service, admission of receipt of copy or otherwise, that it or a copy thereof was ever served on the adverse party a,s required by the code section last referred to. The document styled \u201cPlaintiff\u2019s Amendments,\u201d etc., is equally devoid of any indication of service on defendant. The transcript following the court\u2019s order above set forth contains the following: \u201cEndorsed: Filed Oct. 28, 1926. L. E. Lampton, County Clerk; by J. D. John, deputy.\u201d There is nothing specific to indicate what this refers to, but we may be justified in assuming, from the order immediately preceding it and from the clerk\u2019s certificate, that it refers to both of the documents we are discussing.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>Apart from the unexplained lapse of more than five months\u2019 time between the filing of the notice of appeal and the order settling the \u201cBill of Exceptions aiid Amendments Thereto,\u201d no <em>engrossed </em>bill of exceptions has ever been filed. The situation here is almost identical with that in <em>Fritsch </em>v. <em>Stampfli, </em>117 Cal. 441 [49 Pac. 559], where the appellant relied upon alleged insufficiency of the evidence to support the findings. We quote from the opinion in that ease: \u201cThere appears in the transcript on appeal a paper entitled, \u2018Bill of Exceptions,\u2019 purporting to set forth evidence received at the trial, concluding with the statement that, \u2018The foregoing was substantially all the evidence touching the said tract of land\u2019; following this is another document, headed \u2018Defendants\u2019 amendments to plaintiff\u2019s bill of exceptions\u2019; the amendments cover several pages of printed matter, and are proposed for insertion at sundry places designated by reference to numbers of lines and pages in the original draft of the plaintiff\u2019s bill (as we surmise), but there is nothing in the transcript here to indicate the points of insertion; next is a stipulation of counsel that the amendments suggested were correct, and \u2018that the plaintiff\u2019s bill of exceptions herein, with the defendants\u2019 amendments thereto attached be settled, \u2019 etc. Then appears an order signed by the judge settling and allowing the \u2018 within bill of exceptions. \u2019 There was no engrossment\u2014no incorporation of the proposed bill and amendments in one paper\u2014 and the statement at the close of plaintiff\u2019s proposed bill that the matter preceding it \u2018was substantially all the evidence, \u2019 was permitted to stand. For the reason that the so-called bill of exceptions is not presented in a manner to be considered in this court, and is unintelligible, the judgment must be affirmed. <em>(Marlow </em>v. <em>Marsh, </em>9 Cal. 259; <em>Skillman </em>v. <em>Riley, </em>10 Cal. 300; <em>Baldwin </em>v. <em>Ferre, </em>23 Cal. 461; <em>Kimball </em>v. <em>Semple, </em>31 Cal. 657.)\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">In <em>Vierra </em>v. <em>Fontes, </em>135 Cal. 126 [66 Pac. 241, 242], the question of the necessity for an engrossment of the proposed bill of exceptions and of the allowed amendments thereto was again before the Supreme Court. The transcript in that ease contained a \u201ccertificate\u201d signed by the trial judge attached to the draft of a bill of exceptions presented by the appellant, wherein it was certified that \u201cthe foregoing bill of exceptions, with the amendments thereto <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>offered by the defendant, which are allowed, is true and correct, and is hereby allowed and settled.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">It also contained what appeared to be defendant\u2019s proposed amendments. This was held not to comply with the requirement that after having been settled \u201cthe bill must thereupon be engrossed and presented to the judge to be certified, by the party presenting it, within ten days\u201d (sec. 650, Code Civ. Proc.). Said the court: \u201cThe bill of exceptions as completed by the amendments was not engrossed, and, of course, there was no engrossed bill certified by the judge\u2014which has been held necessary by numerous decisions of this court. <em>(Fritsch </em>v. <em>Stampfli, </em>117 Cal. 441 [49 Pac. 559], and cases there cited.) For these reasons there is no bill of exceptions before us.\u201d Referring to the judge\u2019s certificate in that case the court pointed out that \u201cwhat the amendments allowed were does not appear in anything that precedes the certificate.\u201d So here there is nothing in the certificate or elsewhere in the transcript to indicate which, if any, of the plaintiff\u2019s amendments were allowed and should have been incorporated in an engrossed bill of exceptions, certified by the trial judge to be correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">Because of the trial court\u2019s failure to find upon the issues tendered by the counterclaim and the answer thereto, the cause must be remanded. There is no necessity, however, for a retrial of the issues as to the rendition of legal services by plaintiff as set forth in the complaint and as to the reasonable value thereof. As to these matters the judgment is modified by deducting from the amount thereof the sum of $163, interest erroneously allowed, and the further sum of $15.45, the difference between the credit admittedly due to appellant and the figures erroneously incorporated in the findings, thus reducing the amount awarded respondent to $710.25. As so modified that portion of the judgment is affirmed, subject, however, to whatever, if any, diminution of the amount thereof the court, on a retrial of the issues raised by the counterclaim and the answer thereto, may find and determine the defendant to be entitled to. For the purpose of a retrial as to such issues the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">Craig, Acting P. J., and Thompson (Ira F.), J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>A petition for a rehearing of this cause was denied by the District Court of Appeal on October 29, 1929, and a petition by respondent to have the cause heard in the Supreme Court, after judgment in the District Court of Appeal, was denied by the Supreme Court on November 25, 1929.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">All the Justices concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
