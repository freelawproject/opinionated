App. 700, 279 Pac. 190). Appellant filed his opening brief pursuant thereto, which is the subject of the attack on this second motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">Respondent, in his notice of motion to dismiss the appeal, uses the following language: \u201cthat said second and further opening brief does not comply with Rule VIII of this court, in that it fails to present \u2018any point separately, under an appropriate heading, showing the nature of the question to be presented\u2019; that the appellant\u2019s opening brief last filed contains but one and a single heading, to-wit: Statement of Case.\u201d A careful examination of appellant\u2019s opening brief discloses that the opposite of this statement is true, i. e., appellant\u2019s brief contains a \u201cstatement of the case,\u201d with its appropriate heading in black type; thereafter follows appellant\u2019s argument, presenting the point that the judgment is contrary to the findings; this point is properly set apart from the other portions of the brief and it is preceded by an appropriate heading in black type \u201cshowing the nature of the question to be presented.\u201d It is true that but one point is raised in the brief but this is immaterial in view of the fact that it is properly set forth.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">The other contentions made by respondent deal with the merits of the case, which fact precludes us from any discussion thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">Motion denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-9\">Works, P. J., and Craig, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
