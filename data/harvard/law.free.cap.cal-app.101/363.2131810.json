J.</author>\n<p id=\"As7\">In this proceeding petitioner seeks to prevent the enforcement of an order made by the Superior Court in a supplementary proceeding brought under section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>717 of the Code of Civil Procedure, in aid of an execution issued pursuant to an order for the payment of alimony in a certain divorce action commenced by Julius Robbins, plaintiff, against Pauline Robbins, defendant. After the supplementary proceeding had been commenced the plaintiff filed a dismissal of his action.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-3\">It is contended that the order for payment of alimony and attorney\u2019s fees <em>pendente lite </em>became inoperative upon dismissal of the action, and therefore that petitioner cannot be examined under the order in supplementary proceedings. Petitioner contends also that supplementary proceedings can be based only upon a judgment, and that an order for the payment of alimony and attorney's fees <em>pendente lite </em>is not a judgment. In our opinion these contentions of petitioner are without merit. We do not doubt that upon the dismissal of the action further payments under the order would no longer accrue; but we think that payments which already had accrued and were due and payable remain so due and payable, notwithstanding dismissal of the action. In section 137 of the Civil Code, where the allowance of money necessary for the prosecution or defense of the action and for support and maintenance is authorized, it is provided that \u201cexecution may issue therefor in the discretion of the court.\u201d Section 140, contained in the same article and same chapter, authorizes the court to require reasonable security for providing maintenance, etc., and \u201cmay enforce the same by the appointment of a receiver, or by any other remedy applicable to the case.\u201d Section 717 of the Code of Civil Procedure is the section which relates to the examination on supplemental proceedings of debtors of a judgment debtor or of those having property belonging to him. It provides that \u2018 \u2018 after the issuing or return of an execution against property of the judgment debtor,\u201d etc., these third parties above mentioned may be required to appear for examination.  The claim that an order for the payment of alimony <em>pendente lite </em>is not a judgment within the meaning of this statute ignores the fact that such order is in its essence, if not in name, a judgment. It has been so treated in the decisions. \u201cThe application for alimony, though it cannot be considered a separate suit, is a proceeding for a separate judgment, which, when granted, has nothing to do with the final judgment in the ease, and will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>not to be affected by it. It is a final judgment from which an appeal may be taken.\u201d <em>(Hite </em>v. <em>Hite, </em>124 Cal. 389, 393 [71 Am. St. Rep. 82, 45 L. R.
