RUBIN, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b484-23\">The district court rendered summary judgment rejecting a harborworker\u2019s claim under 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 905(b) and general maritime law against a vessel aboard which he was injured. It did so because: (1) the harborworker\u2019s accident resulted from an obvious danger, and (2) that danger was created by circumstances about which the vessel neither knew nor should have known. The injured harborworker had ample opportunity to produce evidence sufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact concerning the \u201cnegligence of [the] vessel\u201d required for recovery under \u00a7 905(b), but he failed either to do so or to invoke Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(f) to extend the time available for discovery prior to responding to the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Therefore, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">Because this is an appeal from summary judgment, we accept the version of the facts set forth in opposition to the motion for summary judgment insofar as it is supported by at least some evidence and is not purely speculative or argumentative.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">Richard Teply was employed by Reeled Tubing, Inc. He was assigned, together with Tony Cipriano as operator and two other Reeled Tubing employees, to work on a Mobil Oil Exploration and Producing Southeast, Inc. (MOEPSI) oil well that was on land but accessible only by barge. MOEPSI furnished the barge transportation for Reeled Tubing\u2019s equipment and employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">On February 4, 1986, Teply and his three co-workers drove a Reeled Tubing truck to the MOEPSI dock, arriving in the early morning during a pouring rain. MOEPSI employees required Cipriano to load the Reeled Tubing truck far to one side of the barge in order to leave room for other equipment. The barge was then moved to the well with the Reeled Tubing employees and equipment aboard. The MOEPSI employees traveled on another vessel.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">Reeled Tubing\u2019s machinery was operated from a console that was reached by a ladder. The ladder was in two parts, a top section permanently affixed to the console, and a portable section that was designed to reach from the last step of the top section to the ground or deck. Because of the Reeled Tubing unit\u2019s location on the barge, however, the ladder when attached hung over the edge of the barge. There is no evidence that MOEPSI employees knew of this problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-8\">After the barge had arrived at the well site, a MOEPSI employee instructed the Reeled Tubing crew to rig up as much as possible while they were waiting for other work to be done on the well. In order to rig up, Teply climbed the ladder into the console to check the pressure gauges. He then began to climb down, but, while one of his feet was on the first step of the fixed ladder and he was bringing the other foot down, he slipped and fell onto a pipe that was welded vertically to the edge of the barge. He suffered serious injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-11\">At his deposition, Teply testified that the Reeled Tubing unit was hydraulic, oil had leaked on the fixed ladder and its rails, and the steps were slippery. The ladder \u201cwas wet,\u201d he stated, \u201c[tjhere was oil all over the side of the unit and everything. It was slippery.\u201d The oil made it difficult to climb the ladder and Teply knew he had to be careful. However, Teply adduced no evidence that any MOEPSI employee knew of the danger, and MOEPSI adduced evidence that its employees were not aware of it. Natural Union Fire Insurance Company and Reeled Tubing have intervened in this action to assert a subrogation claim for Teply\u2019s compensation benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-13\">Teply asserts that MOEPSI was responsible for his injury in at least one of three ways: (1) it was responsible for Teply\u2019s slip from the ladder; (2) it was responsible for the problem with the bottom part of the ladder, which, Teply asserts, caused Reeled Tubing employees not to attach it and thus precluded him from grabbing it to break his fall, and (3) it was responsible for the dangerous position of the vertical pipe onto which Teply fell. Teply contends that summary judgment was improper because there was evidence from which the trier of fact might infer the company\u2019s negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-14\">Section 5(b) of the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 905(b), does not impose liability without fault on vessel owners. The statute is limited by its terms to negligence and expressly negates liability for unseaworthiness, which is a form of liability without fault. The Supreme Court interpreted \u00a7 905(b) as it applies to stevedores, but in principle as it applies to other har-borworkers who work on board vessels as well, in <em>Scindia Steam Navigation Company v. De Los Santos.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The Court held that the vessel owner has two duties under the Act: (1) to exercise reasonable care \u201cto <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>have the ship and its equipment in such condition that an expert and experienced stevedore will be able by the exercise of reasonable care to carry on its ... operations with reasonable safety,\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and (2) \u201cto warn the stevedore of hidden danger which would have been known to [the vessel owner] in the exercise of reasonable care.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The vessel owner has no duty \u201cto inspect or supervise the stevedoring operation,\u201d although \u201cthe vessel may be liable if it actively involves itself in the cargo operations and negligently [causes harm].\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">Undisputed facts preclude Teply\u2019s recovery under \u00a7 905(b). First, Teply testified that he slipped because of oil and water on the fixed ladder\u2019s steps, a danger caused wholly by Reeled Tubing\u2019s rather than MOEPSI\u2019s equipment. Furthermore, Teply was aware of the danger; indeed, given the uncontested fact that MOEPSI\u2019s employees were not present on the barge and did not supervise Teply\u2019s work closely, . MOEPSI could have known of the danger only if it was so obvious that Teply could not have failed to recognize it. Ship owners are not liable for obvious dangers that injure contractors aboard their vessels unless the contractors, in order to avoid the danger, would be forced either to leave the job or to face penalties for causing delay.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Although <em>Stass v. American Commercial Lines, Inc.</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>contains a broad dictum to the effect that \u201cthe shipowner has no defense that the hazard was ... \u2018open and obvious,\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the opinion in that case recognizes that this applies only when, \u201c\u2018 \u2018the longshoreman\u2019s only alternatives would be to leave his job or face trouble for delaying the work.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> There is no evidence that Teply was under any time or supervisory pressure, and a good deal of evidence to the contrary. MOEPSI therefore cannot be held liable for his fall.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-15\">Second, Teply claims that the absence of the bottom portion of the ladder precluded him from breaking his fall. However, the absence of the ladder plainly was not a hidden danger for which MOEPSI could be held liable under \u00a7 905(b). Rather, the danger was simultaneously so obvious to Teply and his co-workers as to preclude recovery, and unknown to MOEPSI\u2019s employees, who, the uncontradicted evidence demonstrates, were unaware both of the absence of the ladder and of its significance.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-16\">Third, Teply claims that the vertical pipe on the barge exacerbated his injuries, and that MOEPSI was responsible for the barge\u2019s dangerous condition. However, the pipe became dangerous only because of its proximity to the Reeled Tubing equipment, and again, any danger must have been obvious to Teply. Furthermore, there is no evidence that MOEPSI\u2019s employees either knew or should have known of the danger, a danger that could have been predicted only on the basis of considerable knowledge about Reeled Tubing\u2019s method of operation. Consequently, Teply has failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact that could demonstrate MOEPSI\u2019s negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-17\">Teply cites a number of cases in which the vessel owner was held liable for injuries to longshoremen and harborworkers or in which summary judgment was denied.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> However, there was evidence in each of those cases that the vessel owner knew or should have known of the condition aboard the vessel that caused the worker\u2019s injury. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>Here, as has been explained, there was no such evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\">Although Teply complains that he has not yet taken the deposition of one of the MOEPSI employees, he made no effort to take the deposition for more than a year. He filed suit on February 4, 1987, and in September the district court ordered discovery to be completed by March 21, 1988. The motion for summary judgment was filed on January 20,1988, and although the intervenors were denied additional time to respond under Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(f), Teply failed even to request further time to depose the MOEPSI employee. Under these circumstances, Teply\u2019s failure to depose the MOEPSI employee does not preclude entry of summary judgment against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">In <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett,</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the Supreme Court made clear that the party moving for summary judgment need not disprove its opponent\u2019s claim, but need show only that the party who bears the burden of proof has adduced no evidence to support an element essential to its case. Teply had the burden of proving that MOEPSI was negligent, and it therefore was incumbent on him to bring forth some evidence to this effect.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Teply not only failed to do so; his own deposition testimony made it clear that, under controlling principles of law, MOEPSI could not be held liable for his injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">The district court properly put a quick end to this litigation, saving all of the parties the labor and expense of a trial that would have been fruitless. Accordingly, its judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b485-9\">. 451 U.S. 156, 101 S.Ct. 1614, 68 L.Ed.2d 1 (1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b486-6\">. <em>Id., </em>451 U.S. at 167, 101 S.Ct. at 1622.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b486-7\">. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b486-8\">. <em>Id., </em>451 U.S. at 167-68, 101 S.Ct. at 1622.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b486-9\">. <em>See Morris v.
