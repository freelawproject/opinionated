On January 12, 1979, William Henry Hogan filed a voluntary petition in bankruptcy and routinely received a discharge. Listed as one of the debts was the balance due on student loans Hogan had secured between October 1968 and January 1976, a sum which, with interest, exceeds $8,000. The Wisconsin Higher Education Aids Board (Board), unsuccessful in its motion for a declaration of nondischargeability, appealed to the district court. That appeal was dismissed under Rule 8007 of the Local Bankruptcy Rules for the Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas, and the instant appeal was noticed by agreement of the parties pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1293(b).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Bound by our recent decision in <em>In the Matter of Williamson, </em>665 F.2d 683 (5th Cir.1982), we reverse and remand.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1084-12\">Hogan\u2019s petition was filed during the 11 month gap between the repeal, on November 6, 1978, of 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1087-3,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> a limited nondischargeability provision, and the date its more comprehensive successor, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(8),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> became effective on Oc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>tober 11, 1979. This hiatus was perceived as the product of congressional inadvertence, and not design, in part because of the legislative history of the corrective measure enacted by a subsequent Congress.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>See In the Matter of Williamson; Wisconsin Higher Educ. Aids Bd. v. Lipke, </em>630 F.2d 1225 (7th Cir.1980); <em>In re Adamo, </em>619 F.2d 216 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied sub nom. Williams </em>v. <em>New York State Higher Educ. Servs. Corp., </em>449 U.S. 843, 101 S.Ct. 125, 66 L.Ed.2d 52 (1980); <em>In re Hawes, </em>No. B78-28 (D.N.J.1979), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>633 F.2d 210 (3d Cir.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-4\">A prior panel of this court dispositively addressed this issue in <em>In the Matter of Williamson, </em>concurring in the judgment of our colleagues of the Second Circuit that judicial rectification was mandated, suggesting that a slavish application of \u00a7 317 of the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978 (repealing \u00a7 1087-3) \u201cwithout regard to the obvious intention of Congress would create an absurd result in accord with neither established principles of statutory construction nor common sense.\u201d <em>In re Adamo, </em>619 F.2d at 219. <em>In the Matter of Williamson </em>involved, as does the case at bar, the question of the dischargeability of a student loan scheduled in a bankruptcy petition filed between November 6, 1978 and August 14, 1979. We there stated and held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1085-5\">Like our brethern on the Second Circuit, we believe that common sense and evident statutory purpose must prevail. <em>See United States v. Brown, </em>333 U.S. 18, 26, 68 S.Ct. 376, 380, 92 L.Ed. 442 (1948); <em>United States v. Babcock, </em>530 F.2d 1051, 1053 (D.C.Cir.1976). A literal application of the effective date of \u00a7 317, repealing 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1087-3, would fly in the face of Congress\u2019 intended purpose. We hold that the premature repeal of that section is of no effect with respect to the proceedings below.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1085-12\">This decision by a prior panel of this court controls. Accordingly, we must hold that the premature repeal of 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1087-3 has no effect on the Hogan bankruptcy proceedings. While this holding precludes an automatic discharge of Hogan\u2019s educational loans, it does not prevent his seeking relief under the undue hardship proviso of \u00a7 1087-3.</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-13\">REVERSED and REMANDED for further proceedings consistent herewith.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1084-8\">. Section 236(a) of the 1978 Bankruptcy Reform Act adds 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1293(b), which provides that the courts of appeals shall have jurisdiction \u201cof an appeal from a final judgment, order, or decree of a bankruptcy court of the United States if the parties to such appeal agree to a direct appeal to the court of appeals.\u201d By operation of \u00a7\u00a7 405(c)(1) and (2), section 236(a) is applicable during the October 1979 \u2014 April 1984 transition period.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1084-9\">. The disposition of this case is compelled by <em>In the Matter of Williamson. </em>To preserve our institutional integrity, we must adhere to the precedent established by a prior panel. We cannot do so, however, without expressing our concern that in following the lead of our colleagues of the other circuits we have used a rule of statutory construction to effectively enact a law the Congress did not adopt. There is no ambiguity in the two statutes. The courts have strained to rectify congressional inadvertence by saying, in effect, that one statute is effective 11 months longer than Congress said it was. See, <em>e.g., Carnegia v. Georgia Higher Educ. Assistance Corp., </em>691 F.2d 482 (11th Cir. 1982); <em>In the Matter of Williamson; Wisconsin Higher Educ. Aids Bd. v. Lipke, </em>630 F.2d 1225 (7th Cir.1980); <em>In re Adamo, </em>619 F.2d 216 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied sub nom Williams v. New York State Higher Educ. Servs. Corp., </em>449 U.S. 843, 101 S.Ct. 125, 66 L.Ed.2d 52 (1980); <em>In re Hawes, </em>No. B78-28 (D.N.J.1979), <em>aff\u2019d per curiam, </em>633 F.2d 210 (3d Cir.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-10\">The result of these cases comports with one\u2019s sense of fairness, and would draw our votes if we were operating in a legislative setting. But we are not. In underscoring our concern, we highlight our apprehension that the course we have chosen to pursue has taken us over the line which separates legislative interpretation from legislating. We therefore caution those who would read this opinion to signal that such interpretative glossing will come easily in the future. It will not.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1084-14\">.
