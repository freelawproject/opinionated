We affirm the Tax Court\u2019s dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-25\">In a letter dated August 16, 1973, the Internal Revenue Service recognized the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>Church as a tax-exempt organization under \u00a7 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. Nearly eight years later, the Internal Revenue Service revoked the Church\u2019s tax-exempt status. In a letter mailed on August 7, 1981, Michael J. Murphy, District Director in Atlanta, stated that \u201c[t]his letter is to notify you that the revocation of the recognition of your exempt status is final effective as of August 16, 1973.\u201d Murphy explained that the National Office had concluded that the 1973 letter recognizing the Church\u2019s tax-exempt status should be revoked effective as of August 16, 1973.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">Section 7428(a) of the Internal Revenue Code<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> provides declaratory judgment relief for organizations which have received an adverse determination by the Secretary of the Treasury as to their continuing qualification under \u00a7 501(c)(3). Section 7428(b)(3) sets out the time for bringing such an action:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-5\">If the Secretary sends by certified or registered mail notice of his determination with respect to an issue referred to in subsection (a)(1) to the organization referred to in paragraph (1), no proceeding may be initiated under this section by such organization unless the pleading is filed before the ninety-first day after the date of such mailing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b604-16\">26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 7428(b)(3) (West Supp.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-17\">The record indicates that Murphy sent the August 7, 1981, letter by certified mail and that appellants received that letter on August 13, 1981. That letter qualifies as notice of the Secretary\u2019s determination with respect to the continuing qualification of the Church as a \u00a7 501(c)(3) organization. The Church filed its petition for declaratory judgment on January 12, 1982. That petition was not filed before the ninety-first day after August 7, 1981, the date of the mailing of the notice of the Secretary\u2019s determination. The timely filing of such a petition for declaratory judgment is jurisdictional. Rule 210(c)(3) of the Rules of Practice and Procedure of the United States Tax Court, 26 U.S.C.A. foil. \u00a7 7453 (West Supp.1982);<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Rule 13(c) of the Rules of Practice and Procedures of the United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>States Tax Court, 26 U.S.CA. foil. \u00a7 7453 (West Supp.1982);<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> cf. <em>Johnson v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, </em>611 F.2d 1015, 1018 (5th Cir.1980) (timely filing of petition for redetermination under \u00a7 6213(a) is jurisdictional).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">To escape the statutory requirements governing the time for bringing action, appellants argue that the August 7, 1981, letter did not constitute sufficient notice of the Secretary\u2019s determination disqualifying the Church from its \u00a7 501(c)(3) tax exempt status. This argument lacks merit. In the August 7, 1981, letter, District Director Murphy specifically explained that, if appellants sought to contest the Secretary\u2019s determination, they would have to file a petition for declaratory judgment in the courts before the ninety-first day after August 7, 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the order of the United States Tax Court is</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b604-6\">. 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 7428(a) (West Supp.1982) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-7\">\u00a7 7428.
