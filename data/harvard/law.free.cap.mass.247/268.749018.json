It appeared in evidence that the plaintiff left the market, went out the front door, turned to the right and started up Main Street; that when he had gone about fifteen feet north of the Public Market Building and north of the Public Market premises, he slipped on an overripe banana, fell, and received injuries. The trial judge at the conclusion of the evidence denied a written motion of the defendant for a directed verdict in its favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">The motion should have been allowed. The fact that the defendant sold bananas, and that bananas sometimes fell to the sidewalk from its fruit stand, do not warrant an inferential finding of fact that the banana on which the plaintiff slipped and fell on the sidewalk, not in front of the defendant\u2019s premises but about fifteen feet away, came from the rubbish <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>pile near the fruit stand of the defendant; nor that, if it did, the defendant was negligent in respect to its removal therefrom. Whether the banana came to the place of the accident through the negligence of the defendant, or through the careless conduct of some unknown person, is a matter of pure speculation and conjecture. <em>Goddard </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Maine Railroad, </em>179 Mass. 52. <em>Hotenbrink </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>211 Mass. 77. <em>Norton </em>v. <em>Hudner, </em>213 Mass. 257. <em>Lyons </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>204 Mass. 227. <em>Zugbie v.
