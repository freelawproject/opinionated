His own testimony was that he alighted from the automobile into the pathway of the trolley car, without looking to see if any car was coming; that he did not hear or see the car or know anything about it until it struck him. His view was unobstructed. He is bound by his own testimony. <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>224 Mass. 405. It is manifest that the slightest attention to his own safety would have prevented his injury. While he might depend to a reasonable extent on the expectation that the motorman would not be negligent, he was not justified in abandoning all precautions for self-protection, The circumstance that the automobile had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>stopped just beyond a white pole does not exculpate the plaintiff. It is common knowledge that trolley cars do not stop at white poles unless there are persons waiting to become passengers or passengers to alight. There is nothing to indicate that in the case at bar there was any occasion for this trolley car to stop at this pole. Merely that an automobile comes to a stop near a white pole without signal of any kind so far as appears was no notice to those in charge of the car to bring it to a standstill. The striking of the back light of the automobile by the trolley car has no bearing on the due care of the plaintiff. It does not appear that the plaintiff had any knowledge of the precise position of the automobile with reference to the trolley car or relied upon it in any degree. The plaintiff was in a place of entire safety within the automobile. He voluntarily and without exigency moved into a danger zone by getting in front of an on-coming trolley car, which must have been in plain sight and very near when he opened the door of the automobile and got out.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-3\">The case falls within the authority of numerous decisions. <em>O\u2019Neill </em>v. <em>Middlesex &amp; Boston Street Railway, </em>244 Mass. 510. <em>Gibb </em>v. <em>Hardwick, </em>241 Mass. 546. <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Chadwick, </em>236 Mass. 130, 137. <em>Driscoll </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>233 Mass. 232. <em>Pigeon </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Northeastern Street Railway, </em>230 Mass. 392. <em>Dwyer </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>220 Mass. 193. <em>Hayes </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>224 Mass. 303. <em>Smallwood </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>217 Mass. 375. <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>Worcester Consolidated Street Railway, </em>210 Mass. 132. <em>Kouyoumjian </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>212 Mass. 111. <em>Newburg </em>v. <em>Fitchburg &amp; Leominster Street Railway, </em>219 Mass. 21. <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>202 Mass. 66, and cases there collected. <em>Callaghan </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>200 Mass. 450. <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>197 Mass. 420.
