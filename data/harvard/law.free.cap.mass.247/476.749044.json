The question to be decided is, Was there any evidence for the jury that the defendant was responsible for the operation of the truck by his brother?</p>\n<p id=\"b503-12\">Benjamin Kalicka testified that he lived with the defendant; that without the latter\u2019s knowledge he took the truck <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>from the garage; that \u201che was on his way to collect some money which was due to him personally \u201d when the collision occurred; that he had no operator\u2019s license and when asked to show his license he took <em>\u201c </em>the . . . [defendant\u2019s] license, which was in the automobile, and exhibited that.\u201d The defendant testified that he did not give bis brother permission to use the truck at the time of the accident or at \u201c any other time.\u201d There was evidence that Benjamin Kalicka within \u201c one half hour or forty-five minutes of the accident \u201d was seen \u201c delivering a package from this truck, which was done up apparently in brown wrapping paper.\u201d One witness testified that Benjamin told him at the time of the accident that he (Benjamin) was wearing the defendant\u2019s overcoat and had his brother\u2019s registration and license.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">There was nothing in the evidence to show that the driver was in the employment of the defendant, nor that he was his servant or agent. If the evidence of the defendant and the driver were believed, the truck was operated without the knowledge of the defendant by one who had no authority to operate it and who was not the agent of the defendant. If this evidence were not believed, there was no testimony showing that the driver was the servant of the defendant or his agent. Mere ownership of an automobile is not sufficient to prove that it was engaged in the owner\u2019s business or was in the control of his agent. <em>Trombley </em>v. <em>Stevens-Duryea Co. </em>206 Mass. 516. <em>Canavan </em>v. <em>Giblin, </em>232 Mass. 297. <em>Haskell </em>v. <em>Albiani, </em>245 Mass. 233.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">The fact that the driver was seen delivering a package from the truck about the time of the accident and had the owner\u2019s license in his possession, is not enough to show that he was engaged in the defendant\u2019s business or that the truck was under the defendant\u2019s control.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">As there was no evidence warranting the submission of the case to the jury, judgment is to be entered for the defendant upon the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
