Stodder and Charles Hurwitz that the defendants Eosen Talking Machine Company, Sol M. Sugerman, Ben H. Sugerman and Lillie E. Sugerman be adjudged in contempt of court for failure to obey and comply with the terms of the final decree and injunction entered in the Superior Court, after rescript from the Supreme Judicial Court affirming the final decree previously entered in the Superior Court. The case in the Supreme Judicial Court is reported in 241 Mass. 245.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">The final decree, after rescript, ordered, adjudged, and decreed, <em>\u201c </em>That the defendant corporation, its officers, agents, servants and employees be and they hereby are forever enjoined and restrained from playing or permitting to be played either in the doorway or entrance outside of its store premises, No. 11 and 11A School Street, Boston, Mass., or inside the store premises near the door or doorway of the said store, any records on a talking machine, vietrola, graphophone, phonograph, or grafonola in such a manner as to cause the noise produced from the playing of records on said victrolas, talking machine, graphophone, phonograph, or grafonola to be appreciably audible or heard in any part of the respective places of business occupied by the plaintiff Frank F. Stodder at 10 and 14 School Street, Boston, and the plaintiff, Charles Hurwitz, at 12 School Street, Boston.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">The defendants appeared and filed answer to the petition, wherein they denied that they or any of them \u201c have in any manner failed to comply with the orders and terms of the final decree entered in this case; \u201d and also answered <em>\u201c . . . </em>that the respondents and each of them have in all respects <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>carefully observed and performed the decree in each of its several provisions respecting the rights of the respondent Talking Machine Company to play the graphophone \u2018 either in the doorway or entrance of its store premises \u2019 or \u2018 inside the store premises near the doorway of the said store; \u2019 \u201d and <em>\u201c </em>that the playing of the graphophone in the manner and form that the same has been played since the entry of the final decree has been in accordance with advice given to it by its counsel; that the playing of the said graphophone in the manner recommended by the said counsel was, it was advised, a compliance with said decree and that it has in all respects only operated the aforesaid graphophone in the manner advised by its counsel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b90-3\">Upon return of the order of notice upon this petition for contempt, and after hearing, the case was referred to a master \u201c to hear the parties and their evidence on the question of whether or not the decree has been violated by the defendants or any of them, the master to find the facts and report them to the court.\u201d The master heard the parties and their evidence, pursuant to the interlocutory decree appointing him master, and duly made his report. The court by an interlocutory decree sustained certain exceptions of the plaintiff to the report and confirmed the report, except in so far as it is affected by the decree sustaining the said exceptions. The court thereupon found and adjudged the defendants Rosen Talking Machine Company, Sol M. Sugerman and Ben H. Sugerman guilty of contempt, and the defendant Lillie E. Sugerman not guilty; and sentenced each of the defendants Rosen Talking Machine Company, Sol M. Sugerman and Ben H. Sugerman, to paya fine of $100. At the request of the defendants, and by agreement of the parties, the court suspended the said sentences and reported the case for the consideration of the Supreme Judicial Court upon the record in the original case, the rescript of the Supreme Judicial Court in said case, final decree after re-script, the petition for attachment for contempt and the answer of the defendants thereto, the report of the special master and the plaintiffs\u2019 exceptions thereto, and the memorandum of the trial judge of his findings, rulings, and order on the report of the special master.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>The master found that the defendants Sol M. Sugerman and Ben H. Sugerman admitted full knowledge and notice of the injunction; that \u201c after the final decree . . . [they] consulted their attorney and that thereafter they went ahead with full knowledge of the provisions of the final decree and advisedly took whatever steps were taken.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\">The master found with regard to the number of times which the machine has been played since the decree as compared with the number of times before the decree, that \u201c it has been played since the decree about one half as much as before the decree.\u201d With regard to the intensity of the sound since the decree in comparison with the intensity of the sound before the decree he found that \u201c the sound has been generally softer; \u201d that there has been some variation \u201c in the intensity of the sound, depending on the variety of the selection played and the amount of the traffic on School Street; \u201d that \u201c since the final decree the softest needles have been used in the graphophone; \u201d that before the decree the defendant used a louder needle; that on some occasions since the final decree \u201cpieces have been played in such a way that the sound produced and heard in the plaintiffs\u2019 places of business has been equal in volume and intensity to the sound heard on some occasions prior to the final decree, but the sounds produced on these occasions prior to the final decree with which comparison is here made were not the loudest sounds produced before the final decree; \u201d that since the final decree \u201c the loudest sounds produced have been equivalent to the medium sounds before the final decree; \u201d that in the intervals between the distracting noises of traffic \u201c with the softest needle which could be provided, pieces of a loud or noisy character or pieces wherein the human voice rises to a high pitch could be plainly made out even in the rear of Mr. Stodder\u2019s store, although not every note could be heard, especially when the music or singer fell into a softer strain.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">With the consent of the parties, the master took a view of the premises and made a test of the operation of the machine with different needles. As a result of that test counsel agree that \u201c at least one of the records that was played with a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>fibre needle which is supposed to give a very soft tone, could be heard in Mr. Stodder\u2019s store, even over as far as the corner of the store.\u201d They further agree that, \u201c out in front of Mr. Stodder\u2019s store on the sidewalk with the distracting noises of the street, one could not hear the same pieces as well as they could be heard if one went to the rear of the store and-inside.\u201d The master states that he considers the reason for this to be that standing on the sidewalk one is met with noises of greater volume than the graphophone but not of the same intensity, and that the intense sound carries farther. Counsel further agree that some part of every piece played on the graphophone on the day of the test was heard in Mr. Stodder\u2019s store, regardless of the needle used; and the master found such to be the case. The master found <em>\u201c </em>that the average selection played with a soft needle, being played under the ordinary conditions of traffic on School Street, created a sound which was perceptible in Mr. Stodder\u2019s store, but did not amount to such substantial proportions that ... it would interfere with the comfort of and enjoyment of life by the plaintiffs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b92-3\">The finding of the master, that the created sound did not amount to such substantial proportions that it would interfere with the comfort and enjoyment of life by the plaintiffs, affords a complete defence to and exoneration from the charge of contempt, if the words \u201c appreciably . . . heard \u201d of the decree are to be taken in the sense that noise may be produced at the places named in the decree, by means of the machines described in the decree, if the sounds so produced do not substantially and unreasonably interfere with the physical comfort of the plaintiffs. In support of such an interpretation and definition of the words <em>\u201c </em>appreciably . . . heard \u201d as used in the decree, the defendants quote the finding of the master in the original case <em>\u201c </em>that the injury or discomfort caused the petitioners and their employees is out of proportion to the advantage accruing to the defendant in the playing of the machine as it is played over what would accrue to it if it were played in such a way that it could not be heard or appreciably heard in the petitioner\u2019s place of business. If it is so played as to be only slightly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>heard inside the petitioner\u2019s place of business, it would not materially affect them or the success of their respective businesses; \u201d and argues therefrom that the word <em>\u201c </em>appreciably \u201d as used by the master and in the final decree was used therein to indicate that some concession to the necessities of the parties as to noise must be made by the plaintiffs, and some concession to the plaintiffs conferred by the defendants. However reasonable a decree might have been which restrained only a degree of noise which materially and injuriously affected the business of the plaintiffs, it is sufficient to say that the decree which the defendants were required to obey at their peril did not in terms or by necessary implication so provide.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-3\">The decree did not inhibit the use of the machines to the extent that no noise, no sound from the playing of records, would enter the plaintiffs\u2019 premises; and it did not permit the issuance of such noises if they did not cause substantial harm to the business of the plaintiffs or to their reasonable comfort and enjoyment of life. It pointed out in the words <em>\u201c </em>appreciably audible or heard \u201d that the defendants should not play the records upon any of the machines in a manner that caused the noise of the records to enter the premises of the plaintiffs, in such volume and intensity as to be there recognized by the senses as noises produced by the playing of records on the defendants\u2019 premises; that is, it should not be <em>\u201c </em>appreciably audible or heard in any part of the respective places of business \u201d occupied by the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\">The master further found that between June 9 and June 30,1922, which interval of time was after the final decree, the defendants, on each day for one half hour between three and four of the afternoon, operated a radiophone from the window in their building, which is twelve feet horizontally above the doorway or entrance outside their store at No. 11 and 11A School Street; that the mouth of the trumpet, called a \u201c magna vox,\u201d was pointed for three or four days directly toward the Stodder store, and afterward was pointed toward Washington Street from a window sixteen feet nearer Washington Street; \u201c that the noise coming from this devise was at times loud and unpleasantly noisy, that it sometimes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>emitted a roaring or rasping noise when out of adjustment, and that perhaps fifty per cent of the time it was in operation it emitted noises which were substantially audible in the premises of the plaintiff.\u201d It is plain the noises were appreciably audible within the terms and intent of the decree; and equally plain that the defendants are guilty of contempt, as the court found, if the terms of the decree are broad enough to cover and restrain the emission of sounds produced by the operation of the radiophone, which put out such sounds with the same effect upon the plaintiffs as would result from the operation of the machines at the identical place stated in the decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-3\">Noise from the use of the enumerated machines which was entirely within the control of the defendants and would be appreciably heard in the stores of the plaintiffs, and not the position of the machines upon which the records were played, was the injurious thing against the continuance of which the injunction spoke. The use of the radiophone to throw the sounds upon the premises and into the stores of the plaintiffs was a palpable invasion of the spirit, if not of the letter, of the decree. Courts will not permit defendants to evade responsibility for violating an injunction, by doing through subterfuge a thing which is not in terms a violation, yet produces the same effect by accomplishing substantially that which they were enjoined from doing. <em>Gibbs </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>12 Stew. 79. <em>Ex parte Miller, </em>129 Ala. 130. <em>Loder </em>v. <em>Arnold, </em>15 Jur.
