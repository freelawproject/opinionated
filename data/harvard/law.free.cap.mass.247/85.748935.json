It also could be found <em>\u201c </em>that there were five or six lamps with no metallic shades,\u201d and the electric current having been disconnected the defendant sent for the city wire inspector, who testified without objection by the plaintiff \u201c that he examined the cloth texture and, finding that the loose ends of the cloth would burn when touched to a match and that the wiring was not enclosed, he considered the fixture a fire hazard and forbade its use in connection with the public current.\u201d The defendant thereupon returned the fixture and prepaid the charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">The burden was on the plaintiff to satisfy the jury that it delivered <em>\u201c </em>one of \u201d its <em>\u201c </em>display fixtures \u201d as described in the contract, and they were so instructed. It was a question of fact on all the evidence, which included the testimony of its president, whether the plaintiff had fulfilled this requirement, and the motion for a directed verdict, and the first, and ninth requests in so far as not given, that, <em>\u201c </em>If the jury find that the fixtures shipped to the defendant were those which were ordered, and that they were returned to the plaintiff because of some municipal ordinance, regulation or requirement peculiar to the city of Fall River, not disclosed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>by the defendant and made a part of the contract, the plaintiff must recover; \u201d and <em>\u201c </em>If any defect appeared in the canopy, there is no presumption that such defect existed when shipment was made, and the plaintiff is entitled to a reasonable opportunity to remedy it,\u201d were properly denied. <em>Hanson &amp; Parker, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Wittenberg, </em>205 Mass. 319, 328.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">But the plaintiff was the manufacturer, and the defendant could show that, having been sold by description, the implied warranty of merchantability had been broken because of the unworkable and dangerous condition of the fixture itself when received and placed in position for the purpose for which it was designed and sold. The sixth request that there was no evidence that <em>\u201c </em>the fixtures were not merchantable \u201d flatly ignored the defendant\u2019s testimony, and the jury were correctly instructed, that if the defendant had made out this defence to their satisfaction he could rescind the sale, provided they also found that within a reasonable time after receiving the goods he shipped them back in as good condition as they were in when shipped. <em>Inter-State Grocery Co. </em>v. <em>George William Bentley Co. </em>214 Mass. 227. It is urged that notice of rescission was not given within a reasonable time, and therefore the implied warranty was discharged. The jury however were told without any exception being taken by the plaintiff, that the fixture was shipped back in proper condition within a proper time, and the plaintiff having failed to show reversible error, the exceptions must be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
