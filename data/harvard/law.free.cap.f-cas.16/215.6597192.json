There was no testimony taken in the case; and at the hearing in the district court, upon these pleadings and proceedings, the learned judge dismissed the libel without costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-31\">It is evident, that this decree was founded upon the opinion that the district court had not jurisdiction; and certainly, if it had not jurisdiction, independently of the consent of the parties, that consent could not confer it. But the circuit court is of opinion that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>district court had jurisdiction of the case, as presented in the libel, and admitted in the answer. The reasoning and authorities upon which this opinion rests, have been already stated in the case of Reppert v. Robinson [Case No. 11,703], in which the same questions arose; and it is unnecessary to repeat them here; but upon the grounds there stated, this court is of opinion that the decree of the district court in this case is erroneous, and must be reversed. Decree reversed with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
