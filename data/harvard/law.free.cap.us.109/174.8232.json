The vessel in this case did pass in by the way of Cap'e.Henlopen, and was spoken by a Delaware pilot after she had entered the Capes. A Delaware pilot tendered his-services to the incoming vessel within the exempted district bound for Philadelphia. The -services being refused, the vessel was libelled in the District Court of the United States for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania to recover the legal fees for them. The claim was resisted on the ground that the court had no jurisdiction., . The court allowed the claim, whereupon the attorney-general of the State of Pennsylvania applied to this court for a writ of prohibition to the court below, directing it ' to refrain from any further proceedings in the case.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b207-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number><em>Mr. I.

A court may act beyond its jurisdiction in taking cognizance of a particular cause of action, although within its general jurisdiction. When it clearly appears that the court below has exceeded its proper powers, this complete remedy is the proper, one. The brief cites and discusses <em>Quimbo Appo </em>v. <em>The </em>People, 20 N. Y. 531; <em>State </em>v. <em>Ridgell, </em>2 Bailey, 560; <em>Ex parte Gordon, </em>104 U. S. 515; <em>Ex parte Ferry Co., </em>104 U. S. 519; <em>Ex parte Hagar, </em>104 U.

S. 520, where it was held \"on the authority of <em>Ex pante Gordon, </em>id. 515, that as the admiralty court had-jurisdiction of the vessel sued, and the subject-matter of the suit, it could not be restrained by a-writ of prohibition from deciding all questions properly arising in that suit.' This, like that, is a suit for pilotage fees, and the question is, whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>a statute of Delaware, under which, the fees are claimed, is vali\u00e1. If valid' in Delaware it is in Pennsylvania, and. the court sitting in Pennsylvania is as cdmpetent to decide that question in a suit of which it has jurisdiction,. as a court in Delaware. The jurisdiction of \"the court in Pennsylvania is no more dependent oh the validity of the law than was that of the court in Delaware. The1 subject-matter of the suit is a claim of a Delaware pilot for his pilotage fees under a Delaware statute, and the sole question in the case is, whether the fees are recoverable. The vessel when seized was confessedly within the jurisdiction of the court in Pennsylvania, and she was properly brought into court to answer th\u00e9 claim which was made upon her. About that there is no dispute, as there was at the last term in <em>Devoe Manufacturing </em>Company, 108. U. S., where the question was as to the right of the court in New Jersey to send its process to the place where the seizure Was made. There the question was as to the jurisdiction of the court' oyer a particular place; here as to the liability of a vessel confessedly seized within the territorial jurisdiction of the court upon a claim subject tq judicial determination in an admiralty proceeding. The evident purpose of this application is to correct a supposed error in a judgment of an admiralty court on the merits of an action. That cannot be done by prohibition. The remedy, if any, is by appeal. If an appeal will not lie, then the parties are concluded by what has been done. Congress alone has the power \u2022 to. determine whether the judgment, of a court of the United States, of competent jurisdiction, shall be reviewed or not. If it fails to provide for such a review, the judgment stands as the judgment of the court of last resort, and settle? finally the rights of the parties which are involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">\n<em>The petition is dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
