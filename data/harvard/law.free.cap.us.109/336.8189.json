That court dismissed his petition, on the following facts found by it: In February, 1877, the appellant was tried on four charges and specifications,, before a general court-martial composed of ten officers. One of them, Colonel Merritt, was the colonel of the 5th cavalry. They were all present. The appellant being before the court, and the order appointing it being read, lie was asked if he had any objection to any1 member of the court present, named in the order, to which he replied in the negative. The oaths were then administered to the members of the court in the presence of the appellant. The first three of the charges and specifications were preferred by the lieutenant-colonel of the 5th cavalry, and the fourth by Colonel Merritt. The appellant was represented by counsel of his own selection.'\u2019 Tie pleaded not guilty. Colonel Merritt was sworn \u00e1s a witness on the part of the government, and gave testimony in support of the charge \u25a0 and specifications preferred by him, but gave no testimony in regard to the other charges and specifications. The day after the appellant pleaded not guilty, he withdrew, by leave of the court, his plea of not guilty to the second charge and its specifications, and entered a plea of guilty thereto. Colonel Merritt continued to sit as a member of the court throughout the trial, and participated in rendering the final judgment. At the close of the evidence, the appellant submitted, in writing, a statement of his defence, which was read to the court. It contained no objection or reference to the participation of Colonel Merritt in the trial, as a member of the court, or- to his having been so sworn and examined as a witness on behalf of the government. The court found the appellant guilty of all the charges and specifications, and sentenced him to be dismissed from the service. The proceedings, findings, and sentence of the court were approved by the President of the United States, who ordered that the sentence should take effect on the 28th of April, 1877. On the 27th of June, 1877, the \u2019\u00b0te not being in.res<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>sion, the president appointed Henry J. Goldman to be a second lieutenant in the 5th regiment of cavalry, and, on the 15th of October, 1877, he nominated Goldman tO' the. senate for' appointment as second lieutenant in said regiment in place of the. appellant, dismissed,, to date from June 15th, 1877.. The senate advised and consented to the appointment of Goldman, and he was. accordingly commissioned and still holds the office of such second lieutenant.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b370-5\">Mr,. <em>James' Cbliemam </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AhA\">I. Courts-martial are courts of limited and special jurisdiction, and it is essential to their validity that it should be affirmatively shown that they acted upon a case <em>dearly </em>within their jurisdiction, and that their proceedings were strictly regular/ No presumption can be indulged in favor of the validity of the judgment of such a court, and its judgment is everywhere treated <em>as a </em>nullity,. unless the record affirmatively shows both jurisdiction and regularity of proceeding. 3 Greenl.

It was held by this court, in <em>Blake </em>v. <em>United States, </em>103 U. S. 227, that the president has the power to supersede or remove an officer of the army by the appointment of another in his place, by and with the advice and consent of the senate, and that such power was not withdrawm by the provision of \u00a7 5 of the act of July 13th, 1866, c. 176, 11 Stat. 92, now embodied in \u00a7 1229 of the Revised Statutes, that \u201c no officer in the military or naval service shall, in time of peace, be dismissed from -service, except upon and in pursuance of the sentence of a court-martial to that effect, or in commutation thereof.\u201d It was held that this provision did not restrict the power of the president, by and with the' advice and consent of the senate, to displace officers of the army or navy, by the appointment of others in their places.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-9\">In regard to the rest of the time covered by the suit, it be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>comes necessary to decide the question raised as to the validity of the sentence of the court-martial. It is contended for the appellant that the court-martial had no jurisdiction to try him; that the fact that he made no objection to any member of the court was not a consent upon his part which conferred jurisdiction on the court-martial; and that the fact that Colonel Merritt was prosecutor, witness and judge rendered the proceedings of the court-martial void. The position is taken that, although there is no statute or regulation which forbids what was done in this case, the sentence of a court-martial in which one of the judges is prosecutor and witness is absolutely void, and that neither what the appellant said nor Avhat he omitted to say, at the time, can cure the defect in the organization of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"AKAl\">That the court-martial, as a general court-martial, had cognizance of the charges made, and had jurisdiction of the person of the appellant, is not disputed. This being so, whatever irregularities or errors are alleged to have occurred in the proceedings, the sentence.of dismissal must be held valid when it is questioned in this collateral way. <em>Thompson </em>v. Tolmie, 2 Peters, 157; <em>Voorhees </em>v. <em>Bank of United </em>States, 10 id. 449; <em>Cornett </em>v. Williams, 20 Wallace, 226, 249. This doctrine has been applied by this court to the judgment and sentence of a naval general court-martial, which was sought to be reviewed on a writ of <em>habeas corpus</em>. <em>Ex parte </em>Reed, 100 U. S. 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">Where there is no laAV authorizing the court-martial, or where the statutory -conditions as to the constitution or jurisdiction of the court are not observed, there is. no tribunal authorized by laAV to render the judgment. Of that character are the authorities cited and relied on by the appellant; but they do not apply to the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">Under the, foregoing Adeivs, Ave express no opinion as to the propriety of'the proceedings of the court-martial in the respects in which they are assailed.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">\n<em>The judgment. of the court of claims is affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b372-8\">Mr. Justice Field did not sit in. this case or take part-in its decision.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
