Va. of 1873, chi 88, \u00a7 31.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b512-4\">The evidence introduced at the trial proved the folloAving facts to the satisfaction of the court: The injury occurred at night, at a place Avhere, as the plaintiff himself testified, \u201c there Avas one network of tracks,\u201d in the defendant\u2019s railroad yard, near the junction of a branch road Avith the main road, and about ten rods from a higlrway crossing. The plaintiff had preAuously been employed on another part of the road. On the night in question, in the performance- of his duty as a brakeman on a freight train, he unlocked a switch Avhich enabled his train to pass from one track to another; and he Avas stooping doAvn, Avitli his lantern on the ground beside him, to unlock the ball of a second SAvitch to let the engine of his train pass to a third track, Avhen he Avas struck and injured by the tender of another freight engine, in no AAray connected with his train, backing doAvn on the second track. The tender projected ten inches beyond the rail. The distance betAveen the adjacent rails of the second and third tracks Avas about six feet. The second switch Avas a ground switch of a kind in common use, the lock of Avhich Avas in the centre of the space betAveen the tAvo tracks; and the handle of Avhich Avas about tAvo feet long, and Avhen lying flat extended towards either track, and Avhen throAvn one Avay opened the SAvitch, and Avhen throAvn the' other Avay closed it. The switch could be worked efficiently and safely by a man standing midway betAveen the tAvo tracks, using reasonable care. It could not be safely worked by standing at the end'of 'the handle Avhile an engine was coming on the track next that end. Upright SAvitches could not be used at a. place where the tracks Avere so near <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>together, without seriously interfering with the moving and management of the trains.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b513-4\">The plaintiff testified that he had never worked a ground switch before, and that the first switch was an upright switch. But he admitted on cross-examination that the two kinds of switches were unlocked in the same manner, and the other evidence established beyond doubt that the first switch was also a ground switch.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b513-5\">'A single witness, who' had been \u00e1 brakeman, called for the plaintiff, in answer to a question, often repeated, of his counsel, whether that was a safe and, proper switch to be used at that point, testified that he could not say it was a very safe place at that time there '; that he thought that was not a proper kind of switch, and an upright switch would have been more convenient to handle; that he did not think it was a very safe ball there; that he thought it was not a safe ball there; and that it could not be unlocked without danger while\" an engine or train was coming upon the other track.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b513-6\">The engine which struck the plaintiff was being driven at a speed of about twelve miles an hour, by an engineman in the defendant\u2019s employ, and there was evidence tending to show that it had no light except the headlight, and no bell, and that its whistle was not sounded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b513-7\">There was no evidence that the tracks were improperly constructed, or that the engineman was unfit for his duty. .The other grounds of action relied on were improper construction and arrangement of the switch; negligence of the defendant in running its engine, by an unskilful and negligent engineman, alleged to have been engaged in a different service for the defendant from that in which the plaintiff was engaged; and omission to comply rvith the requirements of the statute of West Virginia.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b513-8\">At the close of the whole evidence (of which all that is material is above stated), the court directed the jury , to return a verdict for the defendant, because the evidence was such that if a verdict should be returned for the plaintiff, the court would be compelled to set it aside. A verdict for the defendant was-accordingly returned, and the plaintiff sued out this writ of error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b514-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number><em>Mr. B.

After reciting the facts as above, he said:</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">1. It is the settled law of this court, that when the evidence given at-the trial, with all inferences that the jury could justifiably draw from it, is insufficient to support a verdict for the plaintiff, so that such a verdict, if returned, must b.e set aside, the court is not bound to submit the case to the. jury, but may direct a verdict for the defendant. <em>Pleasants </em>v. <em>Fant, </em>22 Wall. 116; <em>Herbert </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>97 U. S. 319; <em>Bowditch </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>101 U. S. 16; <em>Griggs </em>v. <em>Houston, </em>104 U. S. 553. And it has recently been decided by the House of Lords, upon careful consideration of the previous cases in England, that it is for the judge to say whether any facts have been, established by sufficient evidence, from which negligence can be reasonably and legitimately inferred; and it is for the jury to say whether from those facts when sfibmitted to them, negligence ought to be inferred. <em>Metropolitan Railway Co. </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>3 App. Cas. 193.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">Tried by this test, there was no sufficient evidence of any negligence on the part of the railroad company in the construction and arrangement of the switch, to warrant a verdict for the plaintiff on that ground. The testimony of the plaintiff and of his witness was too slight. A railroad yard, where trains are made up, necessarily has a great number of tracks and switches close to one another, and anyone who enters the service <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>of a railroad corporation, in any work connected with th\u00e9 making up or moving of trains, assumes the risks of that condition of things. Although it was night, and the. plaintiff had not been in this yard before, his lantern afforded the means of perceiving the arrangement of the switch and the position of the adjacent tracks. The switch was of a form in common use, and was, to say the least, quite as fit for its place and purpose asan upright switch would have been. It could have been safely and efficiently, worked by standing opposite the lock, midway between the tracks, using reasonable care; and it was unnecessary, in order to work it, to stand, as the plaintiff did, at the end of the handle, next the adjacent track.</p>\n<p id=\"AUQ\">2; The general rule of. law is now firmly established, that one who enters the service of another takes upon himself the ordinary risks of the negligent acts of his fellow servants in the course of the employment. This court has not hitherto had occasion to decide Avho are fellow servants, within the rule. In <em>Packet Company </em>v. McCue, <em>17 </em>Wall. 508, and in <em>Railroad Company </em>v. <em>Fort, 17 </em>Wall. 553, the plaintiff main-tained his action because at the time of the injury he was.-n.ot' acting under his contract of service with the defendant; inthe' one case, he had wholly ceased to be the defendant\u2019s servant; in the other, being a minor, he was performing, by direction of his superior, work outside of and disconnected with the contract which his father had made for him with the defendant. In <em>Hough </em>v. <em>Railway Company, </em>100 U. S. 213, and in <em>Wabash Railway Company </em>v. <em>McDaniels, </em>101 U. S. 454, the action Avas for the fault of the master ; either in providing an unsafe engine, or in employing unfit servants.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">Nor is it necessary, for the purposes ,\u00f3f \u00e9his cas\u00e9, to undertake to lay down a precise and exhaustive definition of the general rule in this respect, or to weigh the conflicting views which have prevailed in the courts of the several States; because persons standing in such a relation to one another as did this plaintiff and the engineman of the other train - are fellow servants, according to the very great preponderance of judicial authority in this country, as.well. as. the uniform course of decision in the House of Lords, and in the English and Irish <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>courts, as is clearly shown by the cases cited in the margin.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> They are employed and paid by the same master. The duties of the two bring them to-work at the same place at the same tipie, so that the, negligence of the\u2019one in doing his work may injure the other in doing his work. Their separate services have an immediate common object, the moving of the. trains. Neither works under the orders or control of the other. Each, by entering into his contract of service, takes the risk of the negligence of the .other in performing his service; and neither can maintain an action\" for an injury caused by. such negligence, against the corporation, their common master.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">The only cases cited by the plaintiff, which have any tendency to support the opposite conclusion, are the decisions of the Supreme \u2018Court of Wisconsin in <em>Chamberlain </em>v. <em>Milwaukee &amp; Mississippi Railroad Co., </em>11 Wis. 248, and of the Supreme Court of Tennessee in <em>Haynes </em>v. <em>East Tennessee &amp; Georgia Railroad Co., 3 </em>Coldw. 222, each of which wholly rejects the doctrine of the master\u2019s exemption from liability to one.servant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>for the negligence of another, and the first of which has been overruled by the later cases in the same State.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">This action cannot, therefore, be maintained for the negligence of the engineman in running his engine too fast, or in not giving due notice of its approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">3. The statute of West Virginia, on which the plaintiff relies, has no application to this case. There is no evidence that the engine which struck the plaintiff was about to cross a highway; and the main, if not the sole, object of the statute evidently was to protect travellers, on the highway. <em>O\u2019Donnell </em>v. <em>Providence &amp; Worcester Railroad Co., </em>6 R. I. 211; <em>Harty </em>v. <em>Central Railroad </em>Co., 42 N. Y. 468. It may perhaps ,in: elude passengers on the trains, or strangers not trespassers on the line of the. road. But it dobs not supersede the general rule of law which exempts the corporation from liability to its own servants for the fault of their fellow servants.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"AmEx\"> <em>Farwell v.
