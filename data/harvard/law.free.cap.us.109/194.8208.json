Eliza A. Quitman, the defendant in error and appellee, having died since the judgment below, William S. Lovell, her executor, appeared in her stead.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b227-8\">In the action at law, she hied a petition against George D. Cragin in the Circuit Court of the United States for the District of Louisiana, alleging that, she was a citizen of New York and he was a citizen of Louisiana; that on the 31st of January, \u25a01878, she sold a plantation to Orlando P. Fisk, for the price of $22,500, of which the sum of $4,500 was paid .in cash, and for the rest of which nine notes \u00f3f Fisk were given, for $2,000 each, payable in successive years, and secured by a mortgage of the estate; that Cragin had paid the first three of the notes, and the petitioner, by foreclosure and sale of the estate under the mortgage, had obtained the sum of $10,447.05, to be credited on the remaining notes under date of May 1,1874; and further alleging as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b227-9\">\u201cNow your petitioner represents that George D. Cragin is and was the real owner of said property, and liable to your petitioner, for the following reasons, viz :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b227-10\">\u201c That subsequently to the said purchase of property by said Fisk, by a certain proceeding filed in this honorable .court, the said Cragin did claim the entire ownership of the said property, and did claim that the purchase made in the name of the said Fisk was illegally entered in his own name by said Fisk, who was acting merely as the agent1 of said Cragin, and that the amount of the purchase price of \u2022 said property paid in cash, as well as the first and second notes aforesaid, were made by said Fisk with the money of said .Cragin, and- that he, said Cragin, was liable for and ready to pay for said property ; that thereafter, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>in due course of law', and after proper proceedings, the said Cragin was adjudged by this honorable court, by final decree, to be the owner of said property, and the matters and things in said petition contained were found to be true and correct.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b228-4\">\u201cThat pending said proceedings the said George D. Cragin was and in said.case appointed the .receiver of said plantation, so sold by .your petitioner as aforesaid, and that, acting as such receiver, and subsequently as such owner of . said plantation, he did remove therefrom all the movable property thereon, and which existed thereon at the date of the sale by your petitioner to sgid Fisk, of a value exceeding $1,000, and did lay .waste and dilapidate the said property, to benefit his adjoining plantation, and to the detriment of your petitioner\u2019s rights.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b228-5\">\u201c Petitioner further avers, that' by reason of the causes aforesaid the said George D.

The bill set forth the proceedings in the suit at law; and its only other material allegations were, that the Circuit Court had no jurisdiction of that suit, because both parties were citizens of New York; and that Quitman, knowing that fact, falsely and fraudulently alleged Cragin to be a citizen of Louisiana, and illegally and unjustly obtained judgment by default against him.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b228-9\"><em>Mr. J.

N. <em>Benedict, </em>for Loyell,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AXs\">in the suit at law contended that Cragin, having alleged in his bill in equity against Fisk that he was liable to pay for and ready to pay for the property, by the laws of Louisiana Lovell could enforce this stipulation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b229-7\">Civil Code of Louisiana: \u201c Art. 1890. A person may also, in his own name, make some advantage for a third person the condition or consideration of a commutative contract or onerous donation; and if such third person consents to avail himself of the advantage stipulated in Ms favor, the contract cannot be revoked.\u201d <em>Bank </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>4 Rob. (La.) 440, 441; <em>Myers </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>1 La. Ann. 372; <em>Bank </em>v. <em>Lawless, 3 </em>La. Ann. 129; <em>Bonnafe </em>v. <em>Lane, </em>5 La. Ann. 225. And in the case of <em>Hendrick </em>v. <em>Lindsay, </em>93 U. S. Rep. 143, this court held: \u201c It is now the prevailing rule in this country that a party may maintain assumpsit on a promise not under seal made to another for his benefit.\u201d In <em>Brewer </em>v. <em>Dyer, </em>7 Cush. 337, the defendant made a written promise to the lessee, of a shop to take his lease (which was under seal) and pay the rent to the lessor according to its terms, entered into the possession of the shop with the lessor\u2019s knowledge, paid him the rent quarterly for a year, and then, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>before the expiration of the lease, left the shop, and was held liable to an action by the lessor for the rent subsequently accruing, and this ivas distinctly approved in <em>Exchange Bank </em>v. <em>Rice, </em>107 Mass. 42.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b230-4\">The former proceeding \\vas against the property, not against the agent. Lovell is not therefore precluded from proceeding against Oragin the principal.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b230-5\">Mr. Justice Gray</author>\n<p id=\"AunQ\">delivered the opinion of the court. After reciting the facts as above stated, he continued:</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">It is quite clear that the bill in equity was -rightly dismissed, because it; contains no allegation that Oragin- did not know, before the judgment against him in the suit at law, that the plaintiff in that suit alleged that' he was a citizen of Louisiana. If he-did then know it, he should have appeared jmd pleaded in abatement; and equity will not relieve him from the consequence of his own negligence. <em>Jones </em>v. <em>League, </em>18 How. 76; <em>Crim </em>v. <em>Handley, </em>94 U. S. 652. The decree in the suit in equity must .therefore be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">But it is equally clear'that the -judgment at law is erroneous.' The petition shows no privity between the plaintiff and Oragin. It alleges -no promise or contract by Oragin to or with the plaintiff. The mere description of' the notes received by the plaintiff, as \u201cnotes of Fisk,\u201d does not show that they were not negotiable instruments, but on the contrary, in the connection. in which it is used, and applied to notes given for the purchase money of land and secured by mortgage thereof,. designates (as was assumed by both counsel at the argument) negotiable promissory notes, bearing no name but that of Fisk as maker; and on such notes no action will lie against any other person. <em>Nash </em>v. <em>Towne, </em>5 Wall. 689, 703; <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Robbins, </em>16 Gray, 7<em>7, In re Adansonia Fibre Co., </em>L. R. 9 Ch. 635; <em>Daniels </em>v. <em>Burnham, </em>2 La. 243, 245. The case does not come within the decisions, in <em>Mechanics\u2019 Bank of Alexandria </em>v. <em>Bank of Columbia, </em>5 Wheat. 326, in <em>Metcalf </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>104 U. S. 93, and <em>Hitchcock </em>v. <em>Buchanan, </em>105 U. S. 416, in each of which the name of the principal appeared upon the face of the note.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">If the action is treated, not as an action upon the notes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>themselves, but as an action to recover the amount of. the notes, by reason of a subsequent agreement of Cragin to pay them, the plaintiff fares no-better. The only allegations touching the relation of Cragin to these notes are, that, in a suit by him against Fisk, he alleged that Fisk in purchasing the land acted merely as his agent, and that he owned the land and was hable and ready to pay for it; and that he was thereupon adjudged to be the owner of the land and took possession thereof. If this amounted to a promise to any one, it was not a promise to the plaintiff, nor even a promise to Fisk to pay to the-plaintiff the amount of the notes, bu$ it Avas, at the utmost, a promise to Fisk to pay that amount to him, or to indemnify him in case he should have to pay it. It is therefore not AArithin the provisions of the Louisiana Codes, cited in argument; <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> and the defendant is liable to an action at kvw by Fisk only, and not by the plaintiff. <em>National Bank </em>v. <em>Grand </em>Lodge, 98 U. S. 123; <em>Exchange Bank </em>v. <em>Rice, </em>107 Mass. 37; <em>M\u2019Cauley </em>v. <em>Hagan, </em>6 Rob. La. 359. The final allegation,-that by reason of the causes aforesaid, the defendant is indebted and liable-to the' plaintiff, is a mere conclusion of laAV, which is not admitted by demurrer or default. <em>Hollis </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>13 Gray, 392.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">The judgment, having been rendered on default upon a declaration setting forth no cause of action, may be reversed on writ of error. <em>McAllister </em>v. <em>Kuhn, </em>90 U. S. 87; <em>Hollis </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>above cited; <em>Louisiana Bank </em>v. <em>Senecal, </em>9 La. 225. This court, on reversing a judgment of the circuit court, may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>order such judgment for either party as the justice of the case may require. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 701; <em>Insurance Cos. </em>v. Boykin, 12 Wall. 433. In the case at bar, the order, following the precedent of <em>Slacum </em>v. Pomery, 6 Cranch, 221, will be that the judgment below be reversed, and the case remanded with directions that judgment be arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">\n<em>Ordered accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b231-6\"> \u201c A person may also, in his own name, make some advantage for a third person the condition or consideration of a commutative contract or onerous donation; and if such third person consents to avail himself of the advantage stipulated in his favor, the contract cannot bo revoked.\u201d Louisiana Civil Code of 1870, art. 1890.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">\u201cAn equitable action is that which does not immediately arise from a contract, but from equity.in favor of a third person, not a party to it, and for whose benefit certain stipulations have been made; thus, if one stipulated in a contract entered into with another person, and as an express condition of that contract, that this person should pay a certain sum on his account, or give a certain thing to a third person, not a party to the act, that third person has an equitable action against the one who has contracted the obligation, to enforce the execution of the stipulation.\u201d Louisiana Code of Practice, art. 85.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
