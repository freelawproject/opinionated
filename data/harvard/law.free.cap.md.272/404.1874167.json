The Court of Special Appeals in an unreported opinion in <em>Charles Edward Wilhelm v. State </em>[No. 224, Sept. Term, 1973], affirmed the judgments.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>At the commencement of his trial the Assistant State\u2019s Attorney prosecuting the case, after introducing himself to the jury, stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-5\">\u201cThe State has charged Mr. Wilhelm on a ten-count indictment with assault with intent to murder one Phillip G. Huber, a Baltimore County <em>Police Officer, </em>on September 18, 1972, in Baltimore County. Listed, also, are several other charges. The State intends to prove robbery, assault with intent to rob, resisting arrest, and, under the new handgun bill passed last March, violation of the use of a handgun in the commission of a crime. The State feels <em>this is the Jury\u2019s chance </em>as individuals and collectively as citizens of Baltimore County \u2014 <em>we hear the hue and cry of police protection </em>\u2014 we feel <em>this is your occasion to do something about it.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">Counsel for the appellant objected and requested leave \u201cto approach the bench,\u201d where the following colloquy took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-7\">\u201cMR. MILES: My objection is made on the basis that the prosecutor is making a plea to the Jury in opening statement dealing with passion, alluding to a duty to convict my client to protect the police of our society. I feel it is only going to prejudice us and this is the basis of my objection. There is no more duty for conviction for assaulting a police officer than another person, and I would like to make the objection and I make a motion for a mistrial. I feel it has inflamed the Jury and calls for prejudice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-8\">MR. LaVERGHETTA: I disagree. I think I have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>a prerogative in opening statement to tell the Jury what their duty is and present the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-5\">THE COURT: All right, the motion for a mistrial is denied. You can tell them what their duty is in reference to listening to the entire case but don\u2019t go into the situation about police officer protection or anything else. Closing argument may be different but this is basically what their duty is and what you intend to prove. The motion for a mistrial is denied.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">Counsel for the appellant requested no cautionary instruction to the jury and the trial court gave none. The opening statement was then concluded without further reference to the subject-matter or any additional objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">We granted certiorari in <em>Wilhelm </em>limited to the question: whether the trial judge erred when he failed to declare a mistrial and failed to instruct the jury to disregard comments made by the prosecutor in the opening statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">Kevin Exavier Cook, following a jury trial in the Criminal Court of Baltimore City (Sklar, J., presiding), was convicted of murder in the first degree (of one Charles Dean), of the attempted robbery with a dangerous and deadly weapon (of Dean) and of the robbery (of one James Conyer, a companion of Dean) under a third indictment. The judgments entered on his convictions were affirmed by the Court of Special Appeals in an unreported per curiam in <em>Kevin Exavier Cook v. State </em>[No. 210, Sept. Term, 1973].<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b428-9\">During his opening statement in <em>Cook </em>the Assistant State\u2019s Attorney advised the jury that what he was then telling them was \u201cnot evidence\u201d but was \u201cwhat I say the witnesses will tell you.\u201d During the course of the opening statement counsel for the State undertook to relate to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>jury Mr. Dean\u2019s \u201clast words.\u201d Counsel for the appellant objected, and at a \u201cbench conference\u201d advised the court that what the State\u2019s Attorney was about to relate was inadmissible \u2014 a hearsay statement. Following a denial of a motion for mistrial predicated upon a ruling by the court that he would permit the prosecutor to continue his opening statement, and that if what had been proffered in opening statement \u2014 by either counsel \u2014 was not proved, the jury would be instructed not to consider such evidence, Judge Sklar then instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-5\">\u201cLadies and gentlemen of the jury, as you know there has been an interruption of Mr. Libowitz\u2019 opening statement to you. What I want to tell you is anything that is said to you in <em>opening statements </em>by counsel, by lawyers, <em>is not evidence </em>in the case.- And, likewise, anything that is said to you by counsel, whether or not for the State or for the defense <em>in closing argument, is not evidence </em>in the case. <em>Closing argument </em>is exactly what the word implies; <em>merely argument </em>to persuade you to think in the posture of whoever is talking to you based on the testimony in the case. . . . The only evidence that you hear comes from the witnesses in the case who testify or through exhibits that are filed in the case as exhibits.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">The opening statements of both counsel were then concluded without any additional objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">At the outset of his closing argument before the jury the assistant prosecutor stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-8\">\u201cAs veteran jurors, you will have to decide the issues in the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-9\">I noticed you have paid very close attention to all the witnesses in the case and I appreciate your paying this much attention. Because, <em>what is said from the witness stand and the various exhibits introduced in the case is all that you will use to determine your verdict. </em>You as jurors are triers of the law and the facts.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b430-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>After summarizing the testimony of the various witnesses, midway in his closing argument the prosecutor told the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-5\"><em>\u201cWhat I am telling you now is not evidence. </em>What the defense attorney tells you is not evidence. The only evidence for you to consider is what the witnesses stated on the witness stand plus the exhibits. .. .\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">And at the end of his closing argument the prosecutor stated the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-7\">\u201cCommon sense, that is your greatest asset. Use it. Weigh all of the evidence and determine what happened.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-8\"><em>Last year some three hundred thirty people were murdered in Baltimore City. </em>This is one of those murders from last year; Charles Dean. Maybe you didn\u2019t read about it in the newspapers last year. <em>I don\u2019t know how many people were robbed in the City with weapons. </em>I don\u2019t how [sic] how many, but, a lot. Some of the victims in those robberies were murdered. There are many people like Mr. Charles Dean who are defenseless in the face of four healthy young men. Defenseless, like Papa. You saw him on the stand. He couldn\u2019t defend himself. <em>These are the victims </em>\u2014 <em>the most common victims of the young toughs because they can\u2019t fight back. They are the people that are robbed.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-10\">Some of the people who commit these crimes get away with them because of the type of people they attack. I am sure there is nothing in the world right now that Mr. Kevin Cook would like more than to go scott free and get away with what he did on August 27, 1972. That is what he planned all along when he told his friend, don\u2019t use his name.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-11\">Ladies and gentlemen, you as jurors cannot let Kevin Cook get away scott free. That is why the State is going to ask you to bring back a verdict of guilty.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>Following that statement counsel for the appellant, again at a bench conference, moved for a mistrial on the basis that the State\u2019s Attorney had \u201cmade prejudicial statements\u201d particularly in reference to the number of murders committed in Baltimore and concerning the number of people who had been robbed. The trial court denied the motion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Defense counsel then made reference to the fact that one Leonard Anderson (a co-defendant) had not testified \u2014 \u201cChose not to testify for whatever reason he chose not to\u201d and requested the jury to draw an inference from that fact, and upon objection, the trial court stated that he did not think it was proper to comment about [the] refusal [of a co-defendant] to testify. Similarly, the trial court sustained the objection to the attempt by defense counsel \u2014 in closing argument \u2014 to read to the jury the names of the witnesses listed by the State in the answer to the motion for discovery,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and again to an effort on the part of defense counsel to relate to the jury what his client \u201ctells me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">We granted certiorari in <em>Cook </em>limited to the question: whether the closing argument of the Assistant State\u2019s Attorney was beyond the scope of permissible comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">In the trial of criminal prosecutions, although opening statements in a jury trial cannot be equated with closing arguments made to the jury, there is sufficient similarity of the issues involved in both to permit generally the application of common principles.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Since the common thread both in <em>Wilhelm </em>and in <em>Cook </em>is the alleged prejudicial statements by the prosecutor, we have consolidated both cases for discussion and ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">The primary purpose or office of an opening statement in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>a criminal prosecution is to apprise with reasonable succinctness the trier of facts of the questions involved and what the State or the defense expects to prove so as to prepare the trier of facts for the evidence to be adduced. While' the prosecutor should be allowed a reasonable latitude in his opening statement he should be confined to statements based on facts that can be proved and his opening statement should not include reference to facts which are plainly inadmissible and which he\u2018cannot or will not be permitted to prove, or which he in good faith does not expect to prove. An opening statement by counsel is not evidence and generally has no binding force or effect. To secure a reversal based on an opening statement the accused is usually required to establish bad faith on the part of the prosecutor in the statement of what the prosecutor expects to prove or establish substantial prejudice resulting therefrom. <em>Clarke v. State, </em>238 Md. 11, 19-20, 207 A. 2d 456, 460 (1965); <em>Ott v. State, </em>11 Md. App. 259, 266, 273 A. 2d 630, 634, <em>cert. denied, </em>262 Md. 748 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">As to summation, it is, as a general rule, within the range of legitimate argument for counsel to state and discuss the evidence and all reasonable and legitimate inferences which may be drawn from the facts in evidence; and such comment or argument is afforded a wide range. Counsel is free to use the testimony most favorable to his side of the argument to the jury, and the evidence may be examined, collated, sifted and treated in his own way. Moreover, if counsel does not make any statement of fact not fairly deducible from the evidence his argument is not improper, although the inferences discussed are illogical and erroneous. Generally, counsel has the right to make any comment or argument that is warranted by the evidence proved or inferences therefrom; the prosecuting attorney is as free to comment legitimately and to speak fully, although harshly, on the accused\u2019s action and conduct if the evidence supports his comments, as is accused\u2019s counsel to comment on the nature of the evidence and the character of witnesses which the [prosecution] produces. <em>See </em>23A C.J.S. <em>Criminal Law </em>\u00a7 1093 (1961). <em>See also Cicero v. State, </em>200 Md. 614, 92 A. 2d 567 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>(1952); <em>Meyerson v. State, </em>181 Md. 105, 28 A. 2d 833 (1942); 6 J. Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 1806 (3d ed. 1940).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">While arguments of counsel are required to be confined to the issues in the cases on trial, the evidence and fair and reasonable deductions therefrom, and to arguments of opposing counsel, generally speaking, liberal freedom of speech should be allowed. There are no hard-and-fast limitations within which the argument of earnest counsel must be confined \u2014 no well-defined bounds beyond which the eloquence of an advocate shall not soar. He may discuss the facts proved or admitted in the pleadings, assess the conduct of the parties, and attack the credibility of witnesses. He may indulge in oratorical conceit or flourish and in illustrations and metaphorical allusions. <em>See </em>53 Am. Jur. <em>Trial </em>\u00a7 463 (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">As a limitation upon the general scope of permissible closing argument this Court in <em>Esterline v. State, </em>105 Md. 629, 66 A. 269 (1907), cautioned that counsel should not be permitted by the court, over proper objection, to state and comment upon facts not in evidence or to state what he could have proven. Persistence in such course of conduct may furnish good grounds for a new trial. The conduct of the trial must of necessity rest largely in the control and discretion of the presiding judge and an appellate court should in no case interfere with that judgment unless there has been an <em>abuse of discretion </em>by the trial judge of a character likely to have injured the complaining party. 105 Md. at 637, 66 A. 2d at 272.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">In <em>Toomer v. State, </em>112 Md. 285, 76 A- 118 (1910), the appellant was convicted of having sent a threatening letter to extort money and advised the victim that his \u201cbuildings will all go up in smoke.\u201d The State\u2019s Attorney in his closing argument to the jury stated: \u201cGentlemen of the jury, fires have occurred in this County, buildings have been burned, and it was my duty to act in this matter.\u201d The trial court refused to require the prosecutor to retract the statement and on such refusal the appellant took exception. In holding that the State\u2019s Attorney had not made a statement of any fact outside the evidence as a reason or argument in favor of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>conviction, our predecessors stated \u2014 concerning the closing argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-5\">\u201cIt is unquestionably wrong for the State\u2019s Attorney in his argument to the jury to refer to any matter not testified to by the witnesses or disclosed by the evidence in the case, and it is his duty to confine his remarks to the facts in the case, but if every remark made by counsel in the heat of argument, not strictly applicable to the evidence offered, is to be held sufficient ground for reversing a judgment, few convictions would stand. The remarks to which objection was made were simply a statement by the State\u2019s officer of his reason for taking action in the case before the jury, and was not a statement of any fact outside of the evidence in the case as a reason for or argument in favor of the conviction of the accused. <em>In the absence of something to show that the jury was misled or influenced to the prejudice of the prisoner by such remarks </em>the lower Court would not have been justified in setting aside the verdict, nor would this Court be warranted in reversing the judgment appealed from. In the case of <em>Dunlop v. United States, </em>165 U. S. 486, the Court said: \u2018If every remark made by counsel outside of the testimony were ground for a reversal, comparatively few verdicts would stand, since in the ardor of advocacy, and in the excitement of trial, even the most experienced counsel are occasionally carried away by this temptation.\u2019 See also <em>Esterline v. State, </em>105 Md. 629.\u201d 112 Md. at 292-93, 76 A. at 122. (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">Whether it be in opening statement or in summation, \u201cappeals to class prejudice or to passion are improper and may so poison the minds of jurors that an accused may be deprived of a fair trial,\u201d <em>Wood v. State, </em>192 Md. 643, 652, 65 A. 2d 316, 320 (1949); \u201cthe State\u2019s Attorney has an obligation to refrain from making any remark \u2014 within the hearing of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>the jury \u2014 which is likely or apt to instigate prejudice against the accused,\u201d <em>Contee v. State, </em>223 Md. 575, 584, 165 A. 2d 889, 894-95 (1960), 229 Md. 486, 184 A. 2d 823 (1962), <em>cert. denied, </em>374 U. S. 841 (1963); or, in derogation of the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial, is \u201ccalculated to unfairly prejudice the jury against the defendant.\u201d <em>Newton v. State, </em>147 Md. 71, 92, 127 A. 123, 132 (1924); <em>Meno v. State, </em>117 Md. 435, 441, 83 A. 759, 761 (1912).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">Of course, not every ill-considered remark made by counsel, even during the progress of the trial, is cause for challenge or mistrial. <em>Jones v. State, </em>184 Md. 12, 15, 40 A. 2d 230, 231 (1944), citing <em>Dunlop v. United States, </em>165 U. S. 486 (1897); <em>Callan v. State, </em>156 Md. 459, 144 A. 350 (1929); <em>Dunn v. State, </em>140 Md. 163, 117 A. 329 (1922); <em>Freud v. State, </em>129 Md. 636, 99 A. 934 (1917). <em>See also Esterline v. State, supra, </em>and <em>Toomer v. State, supra, </em>both quoting <em>Dunlop v. United States. </em>What exceeds the limits of permissible comment depends on the facts in each case, even where the remarks may fall into the same general classification. <em>Shoemaker v. State, </em>228 Md. 462, 468, 180 A. 2d 682, 685 (1962); <em>Holbrook v. State, </em>6 Md. App. 265, 268-69, 250 A. 2d 904, 906 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">In <em>Reidy v. State, </em>8 Md. App. 169, 259 A. 2d 66 (1969), Chief Judge Murphy (then Chief Judge of the Court of Special Appeals), stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-7\">\u201cIt is fundamental to a fair trial that the prosecutor should make no remarks calculated to unfairly prejudice the jury against the defendant. <em>Meno v. State, </em>117 Md. 435; <em>Holbrook v. State, </em>6 Md. App. 265. And it is unquestionably wrong for the prosecutor in his argument to the jury to refer to any matter not testified to by the witness or disclosed by the evidence in the case. <em>Toomer v. State, </em>112 Md. 285. On the other hand, the fact that a remark made by the prosecutor in argument to the jury was improper does not necessarily compel that the conviction be set aside. <em>Conway v. State, </em>7 Md. App. 400. The Maryland Rule is that unless it appears that the jury were actually misled or were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>likely to have been misled or influenced to the prejudice of the accused by the remarks of the State\u2019s Attorney, reversal of the conviction on this ground would not be justified. <em>Wood v. State, </em>192 Md. 643; <em>Holbrook v. State, supra.\u201d </em>8 Md. App. at 172, 259 A. 2d at 67-68.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b436-5\"><em>See also Shoemaker v. State, supra; Kellum v.

United States, </em>413 F. 2d 1061 (D.C. Cir. 1969) (cited by appellant <em>Cook) </em>stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-7\">\u201cThe applicable test for prejudice is whether we can say, \u2018with fair assurance, after pondering all that happened without stripping the erroneous action from the whole, that the judgment was not substantially swayed by the error.\u2019 [Citing <em>Kotteakos v. United States, </em>328 U.S. 750, 765 (1946).] The decisive factors are the closeness of the case, [citing <em>Cross v. United States, </em>353 F.2d 454, 456 (D.C. Cir. 1965); <em>Jones v. United States, </em>338 F.2d 553, 554 n.3 (D.C. Cir. 1964)] the centrality of the issue affected by the error, [citing <em>King v. United States, </em>372 F.2d 383, 395 (D.C. Cir. 1967)] and the steps taken to mitigate the effects of the error. [Citing <em>Cross v. United States, supra.]\u201d </em>413 F. 2d at 1079.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b436-9\">In <em>Clarke v. State, supra, </em>the prosecutor in opening statement outlined to the jury what he expected to elicit by way of testimony from a witness; unknown to him the witness had married the defendant and at the trial she elected to refuse to testify against her husband. These remarks were held nonprejudicial because there was no evidence of \u201cbad faith\u201d on the part of the prosecutor. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number><em>also </em>Annot., 28 A.L.R.2d 972 (1953); 23A C.J.S. <em>Criminal Law </em>\u00a7 1085 (1961).

State, supra, </em>it was held improper for a prosecuting officer \u201c \u2018to assert his personal belief or personal conviction as to the guilt of the accused,\u2019 \u201d although his undisputed right to urge that the evidence convinced his mind of the accused\u2019s guilt was recognized.

In <em>Newton v.

State, </em>225 Md. 603, 171 A. 2d 460 (1961), <em>cert. denied, </em>368 U. S. 970 (1962), repeated questions to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>defendant about a prior conviction in 1938, where the defendant denied the conviction and the State thereafter in good faith failed to proffer to prove the conviction, was held highly improper and prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">In <em>Esterline v. State, supra, </em>where a number of the defendant\u2019s witnesses testified in support of self-defense that immediately after the fight the appellant \u201chad marks of fingers on his throat\u201d and the State\u2019s Attorney in closing argument stated that if he had known such evidence would be offered \u201che would have produced 100 witnesses to prove there were no fingerprints on the throat of the defendant at that time,\u201d such argument was held improper. In <em>Wilson v. State, </em>261 Md. 551, 276 A. 2d 214 (1971) (cited by both appellants, <em>Cook </em>and <em>Wilhelm), </em>the prosecutor was summoned as a witness for the defense and testified that his own life had been threatened during the course of the investigation of the case; that the defendant was \u201cHenderson\u2019s number one lieutenant\u201d and volunteered the opinion that Henderson\u2019s murder had been an \u201cassassination.\u201d Such volunteered substantive evidence by the prosecutor was held to be no different from comments made by the prosecutor and held to have been prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">In <em>Holbrook v. State, </em>6 Md. App. 265, 250 A. 2d 904 (1969), the prosecutor in closing argument stated that the defendant \u201chad been on the witness stand many times,\u201d stated that the victim of the assault had told him \u201cthe same version on numerous occasions\u201d (without any evidence of any such fact), that the defendant was \u201cmentally defective and the fact of his being mentally defective could be proven by the fact that he had been convicted of assault and battery on several prior occasions.\u201d Three references were made in closing argument to the defendant\u2019s prior convictions for assault and battery \u2014 going to other than the issue of his \u201ccredibility\u201d and such closing argument was held prejudicial. Similarly, in <em>Conway v. State, </em>7 Md. App. 400, 256 A. 2d 178 (1969), in a prosecution for rape, where the defendant had been previously convicted of assault with intent to rape and where the prosecutor in closing argument made reference to such prior conviction and argued that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>jury [would] \u201chave to think about other young girls in similar circumstances,\u201d such remarks were held to have \u201clikely misled or influenced the jury to the appellant\u2019s prejudice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">In <em>Reidy v. State, supra, </em>where \u201cself-defense was the heart and soul of appellant\u2019s defense\u201d and the prosecutor in closing argument stated: \u201cThere is really no self-defense here. It is a fiction manufactured by defense counsel.\u201d Such reference to a \u201cmanufactured defense by counsel,\u201d suggesting suborned perjury, was held to have denied the appellant a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">In <em>Killie v. State, </em>14 Md. App. 465, 287 A. 2d 310, <em>cert. denied, </em>265 Md. 740 (1972) \u2014 a prosecution for possession of marijuana, its distribution and the maintenance of a \u201ccommon nuisance\u201d \u2014 the State\u2019s Attorney in final rebuttal argument asserted that the appellant, a public elementary school principal, was using the lure of marijuana to entice young boys to his home for homosexual purposes. [There was evidence of the appellant having kissed an adult male.] Upon objection by defendant\u2019s counsel to the reference to enticing young boys, the State\u2019s Attorney changed it to argue that he was \u201cusing this [marijuana] to get men there.\u201d It was held that the introduction of the notion of homosexuality, especially on the part of an elementary school principal vis-a-vis \u201cboys\u201d or \u201cyoung boys\u201d added a totally foreign consideration to the case \u2014 an irrelevancy replete with strong potential for unfair prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">In <em>Glickman v. State, </em>190 Md. 516, 60 A. 2d 216 (1948), a reference made by the prosecutor in closing argument that the defendant was a \u201cPhiladelphia foreigner\u201d was held nonprejudicial. Similarly, in <em>Wood v. State, </em>192 Md. 643, 65 A. 2d 316 (1949), the comments by the State\u2019s Attorney in closing argument that \u201cIt is the policy of the courts, it is the policy of the State\u2019s Attorney, to stop the carrying of guns. I will send every one to jail that carries a gun,\u201d and argument that \u201cHe [the defendant] was at one of these joints where they carry guns,\u201d that \u201cas happens so often at these joints . . . somebody got hurt because somebody came there with a gun. That is what I am trying to break up ... as God gives me strength, I will break it up,\u201d were not found to be a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>sufficient basis for finding that the jury \u201cwere actually misled or were likely to have been misled or influenced to the prejudice of the accused.\u201d And in <em>Toomer v. State, supra, </em>the remarks by the prosecutor concerning fires which had occurred in the county were held to have been nonprejudicial and \u201csimply a statement by the State\u2019s officer of his reason for taking action in the case before the jury, and not a statement of fact outside the evidence in the case as a reason for, or argument in favor of the conviction of the accused.\u201d <em>See also Cohen v.

S. 660 (1937), where a remark by the State\u2019s Attorney in closing argument that a bench warrant had been issued for the defendant by the court was held nonprejudicial. In <em>Britton v. State, </em>10 Md. App. 70, 267 A. 2d 747, <em>cert. denied, </em>259 Md. 730 (1970), a question by the Assistant State\u2019s Attorney directed to a defense witness: \u201cDo you recall testifying on a prior proceeding? \u201d was equally held nonprejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">In <em>Ott v. State, </em>11 Md. App. 259, 273 A. 2d 630, <em>cert. denied, </em>262 Md. 748 (1971), the prosecutor in closing argument stated: \u201cI think that he [Ott] is the type of individual that fits the pattern of the State\u2019s theory of the case and that he is typically the type person who might do exactly what was done under the theory of the State\u2019s case,\u201d was held to be a reference to the appellant\u2019s demeanor on the witness stand and his actions at the time of the alleged crime. That argument as well as the prosecutor\u2019s reference that \u201cWe are lucky we are not here today with a murder charge,\u201d were all held to be fair comment in closing argument. In <em>Peterson v. State, </em>15 Md. App. 478, 292 A. 2d 714, <em>cert. denied, </em>266 Md. 735, 738, 741 (1972), the testimony by a detective that a witness who had been seen to approach the automobile in which the appellant was the only occupant was \u201cknown to me to be a heroin addict,\u201d was held nonprejudicial and \u201ceven if improperly considered on the merits, its impact .. . was minimally cumulative on the ultimate issue of guilt or innocence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">In <em>Witcher v. State, </em>17 Md. App. 426, 302 A. 2d 701, <em>cert. denied, </em>269 Md. 768 (1973), a reference was made by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>State\u2019s Attorney in closing argument concerning a witness who had admitted lying to the police but who testified that he was telling the truth, as to why the witness had been taken before the Grand Jury. Such statement was held to be \u201cfair comment made during the course of oral argument and not misleading to the jury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">In <em>Contee v. State, supra, </em>Judge Horney, who delivered the opinion of the Court, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-6\">\u201c . . . [W]hile the granting or refusal of a mistrial is a matter lying within the sound discretion of the trial court, the court, nevertheless, in addition to sustaining an objection to an improper remark or misconduct, is also entrusted with further responsibility to caution or reprimand the State\u2019s Attorney as the exigencies of the situation may require and to forthwith instruct the jury to disregard the unwarranted remarks and conduct of the prosecuting attorney.\u201d 223 Md. at 584, 165 A. 2d at 895.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">See also <em>Westcoat v. State, </em>231 Md. 364, 190 A. 2d 544 (1963); <em>Newton v. State, supra; Holbrook v. State, supra; Conway v. State, supra; Reidy v. State, supra; </em>and <em>Killie v. State, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">Chief Judge Murphy (then Chief Judge of the Court of Special Appeals), for that court, in <em>Conway, </em>stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-9\">\u201cWe think it too plain to require discussion that the prosecutor\u2019s improper remarks were highly prejudicial, particularly so in view of the fact that appellant, by motion prior to trial, had sought to suppress the prior conviction on the ground, among others that it would mislead the jury into believing that he had committed the present offense because he had been previously convicted of committing a similar offense. In this light, when the prosecutor told the jury that it should consider the fact that \u2018This isn\u2019t the first time for this young man; \u2019 and that \u2018He was convicted of assault with intent to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>rape before,\u2019 we think the occasion was one screaming out for the forceful interdiction of the trial judge, <em>viz., </em>an instruction to the jury that the argument was improper, why it was improper, and a severe reprimand to the prosecutor for making it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-5\">We, of course, have no way of calculating the consideration given by the jury to appellant\u2019s prior conviction for assault with intent to rape. We cannot know, therefore, whether the jury considered such evidence as substantive proof of appellant\u2019s guilt or merely as evidence impeaching his credibility as a witness. That the jury <em>was free to consider the prior conviction as substantive proof of guilt is, however, entirely clear </em>and we conclude that the <em>jury was likely misled or influenced to appellant\u2019s prejudice </em>and that under the circumstances the prosecutor\u2019s improper argument deprived appellant of a fair trial. See <em>Wethington v. State, supra. </em>[3 Md. App. 237, 238 A. 2d 581 (1968).]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-6\">In so concluding we are mindful of the rule that an improper reference to a prior conviction might not constitute reversible error <em>where it was of such minor importance that it was unlikely that the accused could have been prejudiced thereby, </em>or <em>where the State\u2019s evidence was so strong that it is improbable that a contrary result would have been reached by the jury. </em>See <em>Lamar v. State, </em>5 Md. App. 594.\u201d 7 Md. App. at 414-15, 256 A. 2d at 186. (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">In <em>Reidy </em>Chief Judge Murphy, again for the Court of Special Appeals, pointed out not only the lack of any \u201cforceful interdiction\u201d on the part of the trial court, but the approbation given by the trial court to the prosecutor\u2019s prejudicial remarks. He stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-9\">\u201cWhere, as in the present case, the prosecutor\u2019s remarks had such a clear potential of prejudicing appellant\u2019s right to a fair trial, and objection was immediately made thereto on the ground that they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>were \u2018absolutely improper and out of order,\u2019 we think the situation thus created was one screaming out for the forceful interdiction of the trial judge and, at the least, a directive to the prosecutor to apologize to defense counsel for the remark \u2014 this being all that defense counsel had requested be done. But even without the apology sought by the appellant, it is not unlikely that the jury would have considered the prosecutor\u2019s remarks, standing alone, as the practical equivalent of an argument that the claim of self-defense was so far-fetched that is was utterly devoid of any merit. <em>Had not the trial judge, therefore, in referring to the prosecutor\u2019s remarks, instructed the jury that \u2018it is no improper remark, \u2019 </em>a <em>different case may well have been presented than that now before us. But the trial judge\u2019s statement, viewed in the light of his refusal to order the prosecutor to apologize to defense counsel, necessarily reinforced and gave significa,nt substance to the prosecutor\u2019s argument, </em>with the result likely created in the mind of the jury that the trial judge, like the prosecutor, thought appellant\u2019s claim of self-defense was a \u2018fiction manufactured by defense counsel\u2019 \u2014 a conclusion which was considerably strengthened when the prosecutor, without rebuke or correction from the court, interrupted defense counsel\u2019s closing summation to the jury to state that his remarks were not only not improper, but the court had ruled that they were indeed proper.\u201d 8 Md. App. at 178, 259 A. 2d at 70-71. (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">When in the first instance the remarks of the State\u2019s Attorney do appear to have been prejudicial, a significant factor in determining whether the jury were actually misled or were likely to have been misled or influenced to the prejudice of the accused is whether or not the trial court took any appropriate action, as the exigencies of the situation may have appeared to require, to overcome the likelihood of prejudice, such as informing the jury that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>remark was improper, striking the remark and admonishing the jury to disregard it. When such action has been taken by the trial court and found to have been sufficient by the reviewing court, the judgments have not been reversed. <em>See Cohen v. State, supra, </em>where the trial court told the jury to disregard the reference concerning the warrant and determine their verdict from the evidence heard under oath from the witnesses; <em>Clarke v. State, supra, </em>where the court charged the jury to determine the defendant\u2019s guilt \u201cfrom the evidence admitted and not from the fact of his indictment\u201d ; <em>Cook v. State, supra, </em>where the trial court instructed the jury that there was no evidence the defendant had been previously convicted of crime; <em>Wilson v. State, supra, </em>where the court instructed the jury to disregard that portion of the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s testimony which had been volunteered. In <em>Newton v. State, supra, </em>the remarks upon motion were stricken; no other action was requested and the court held that the failure to warn the jury was not reversible error. In <em>Esterline v. State, supra, </em>the court ruled that the prosecutor\u2019s remarks were not proper and he \u201cwithdrew\u201d the objectionable statement. The Court in finding no reversible error gave due weight to the evaluation by the trial judge \u201cof the probable effect upon the jury of the remarks of counsel, as well as of all the events and circumstances of trial.\u201d In <em>Wood v. State, supra, </em>the State\u2019s Attorney stated that he was willing to apologize if his remarks were improper and told the jury that the only issue \u201cwas whether the defendant was guilty of carrying a concealed weapon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">Contrariwise, where no such action was taken by the trial court the prejudice found to have existed were grounds for reversal. <em>See Shoemaker v. State, supra, </em>and <em>Meno v. State, supra, </em>in both of which the trial court respectively overruled the defendant\u2019s objection and denied a motion to strike out the remarks which were found to have been prejudicial; and <em>Conway v. State, supra, </em>where the trial court merely told the prosecutor \u201clet\u2019s not dwell on the previous conviction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">Similarly, reversals have been mandated in <em>Reidy v. State, supra, Holbrook v. State, supra </em>and <em>Killie v. State, supra, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>where the trial courts not only failed to take any curative action, but, in fact, gave approbation to the highly prejudicial remarks of the prosecutor.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">In the recent case of <em>Donnelly v. DeChristoforo, </em>94 S. Ct. 1868 (1974), the United States Supreme Court held that the curative instruction given by the trial court prevented the remarks by the District Attorney in closing argument from being prejudicial and from denying the respondent \u201cdue process.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">In response to argument by counsel for DeChristoforo the District Attorney told the jury: \u201cI don\u2019t know what they want you to do by way of a verdict. They said that they hope that you find him not guilty. I quite frankly think that they hope that you find him guilty of something a little less than first-degree murder.\u201d The trial court instructed the jury that closing arguments were not evidence for their consideration and further instructed the jury that there was no evidence whatsoever in support of the District Attorney\u2019s statement and the jury was instructed to disregard it. The respondent was found guilty of murder in the first degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">Mr. Justice Rehnquist, who delivered the majority opinion for the Court, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-8\">\u201cThis is not a case in which the State has denied a defendant the benefit of a specific provision of the Bill of Rights, such as the right to counsel, Argersinger v. Hamlin, 407 U.S. 25, 92 S.Ct. 2006, 32 L.Ed.2d 530 (1972), or in which the prosecutor\u2019s remarks so prejudiced a specific right, such as the privilege against compulsory self-incrimination, as to amount to a denial of that right. Griffin v. California, 380 U.S. 609, 85 S.Ct. 1229, 14 L.Ed.2d 106 (1965). (Footnote omitted.) When specific guarantees of the Bill of Rights are involved, this Court has taken special care to assure that prosecutorial conduct in no way impermissibly infringes them. But here the claim is only that a prosecutor\u2019s remark about respondent\u2019s expectations at trial by itself so infected the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process. We do not believe that examination of the entire proceedings in this case supports that contention.\u201d 94 S. Ct. at 1871.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">He continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-6\">\u201cIn addition, the trial court took special pains to correct any impression that the jury could consider the prosecutor\u2019s statements as evidence in the case. The prosecutor, as is customary, had previously told the jury that his argument was not evidence, and the trial judge specifically reemphasized that point. Then the judge directed the jury\u2019s attention to the remark particularly challenged here, declared it to be unsupported, and admonished the jury to ignore it. Although some occurrences at trial may be too clearly prejudicial for such a curative instruction to mitigate their effect, the comment in this case is hardly of such character.\u201d 94 S. Ct. at 1872. (Footnotes omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-9\">After observing that \u201cthe prosecutor\u2019s remark here, admittedly an ambiguous one, was but one moment in an extended trial and was followed by specific disapproving instructions,\u201d he continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-10\">\u201cSuch arguments, like all closing arguments of counsel, are seldom carefully constructed <em>in toto </em>before the event; improvisation frequently results in syntax left imperfect and meaning less than crystal clear. While these general observations in no way justify prosecutorial misconduct, they do suggest a court should not lightly infer that a prosecutor intends an ambiguous remark to have its most damaging meaning or that a jury, sitting through lengthy exhortation, will draw that meaning from the plethora of less damaging interpretations.\u201d 94 S. Ct. at 1873.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-11\">In distinguishing the facts from those in <em>Brady v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number><em>Maryland, </em>373 U. S. 83 (1963) and <em>Miller v. Pate, </em>386 U. S. 1 (1967), it was further stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-5\">\u201cBut here there was neither the introduction of specific misleading evidence important to the prosecution\u2019s case-in-chief nor the nondisclosure of specific evidence valuable to the accused\u2019s defense. There were instead a few brief sentences in the prosecutor\u2019s long and expectably hortatory closing argument which might or might not suggest to a jury that the respondent had unsuccessfully sought to bargain for a lesser charge. We find nothing in <em>Brady </em>to suggest that due process is so easily denied.\u201d 94 S. Ct. at 1873.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">Another important and significant factor where prejudicial remarks might have been made is whether or not the judgment of conviction was \u201csubstantially swayed by the error,\u201d or where the evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt was \u201coverwhelming.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">In <em>Berger v. United States, </em>295 U. S. 78 (1935) (cited by both appellants <em>Cook </em>and <em>Wilhelm), </em>the Court characterized the conduct of the United States Attorney as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-8\">\u201cThat the United States prosecuting attorney overstepped the bounds of that propriety and fairness which should characterize the conduct of such an officer in the prosecution of a criminal offense is clearly shown by the record. He was guilty of misstating the facts in his cross-examination of witnesses; of putting into the mouths of such witnesses things which they had not said; of suggesting by his questions that statements had been made to him personally out of court, in respect of which no proof was offered; of pretending to understand that a witness had said something which he had not said and persistently cross-examining the witness upon that basis; of assuming prejudicial facts not in evidence; of bullying and arguing with witnesses; and in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>general, of conducting himself in a thoroughly indecorous and improper manner.\u201d 295 U. S. at 84.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">The Court, after referring to the situation as \u201cone which called for stern rebuke and repressive measures and, perhaps, if these were not successful, for the granting of a mistrial,\u201d held that: \u201cIt is impossible to say that the evil influence upon the jury of these acts of misconduct was removed by such mild judicial action as was taken.\u201d 295 U. S. at 85.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">Mr. Justice Sutherland, who delivered the opinion for the Court, did, however, state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-7\">\u201cIn these circumstances prejudice to the cause of the accused is so highly probable that we are not justified in assuming its non-existence. If the case against Berger had been strong, or, as some courts have said, the evidence of his guilt \u2018overwhelming,\u2019 a different conclusion might be reached. Compare <em>Fitter v. United States, </em>258 Fed. 567, 573; <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>215 Fed. 679, 685; <em>People v. Malkin, </em>250 N. Y. 185, 201-202; 164 N. E. 900; <em>Iowa v. Roscum, </em>119 Iowa 330, 333; 93 N. W. 295. Moreover, we have not here a case where the misconduct of the prosecuting attorney was slight or confined to a single instance, but one where such misconduct was pronounced and persistent, with a probable cumulative effect upon the jury which cannot be disregarded as inconsequential.\u201d 295 U. S. at 89.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b448-9\"><em>See also United States v. Socony Vacuum Oil Co., </em>310 U. S. 150 (1940); <em>United States v.

State, </em>212 Md. 248, 260-61, 129 A. 2d 375, 381 (1957). The decision by the trial court in the exercise of its discretion denying a mistrial will not be reversed on appeal unless it is clear that there has been prejudice to the defendant. <em>See Lusby v.

Except as found in the decided cases, the matter is left to the sound discretion of the presiding judge, acting under his oath of office, having due regard to the rights of the accused and the state. The power ought to be used with the greatest caution, under urgent circumstances, and for very plain and obvious causes.\u2019 \u201d 217 Md. at 196-97,141 A. 2d at 896.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-6\"><em>See also Contee v.

State, </em>272 Md. 312, 322 A. 2d 880; it should never be granted for light and transitory reasons which do not result in any real prejudice to the accused. <em>Johnson v. State, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">This, of course, does not mean that we are absolutely bound by the trial judge\u2019s determination on a motion for mistrial, or by his determination that the remarks were nonprejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-9\">What the Illinois appellate court succinctly stated in the recent case of <em>People v. Mackins, </em>17 Ill.App.3d 24, 308 N.E.2d 92 (1974), seems to be in accord with our cases, when they stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-10\">\u201cThe tendency of reviewing courts in Illinois, based upon the correct proposition that the trial court has a superior opportunity to determine the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>propriety of final argument, is that these issues are generally left to the trial court absent a clear abuse of discretion. <em>(People v. Smothers, </em>55 Ill.2d 172, 176, 302 N.E.2d 324.) It has been held \u2018 * * * impractical to lay definite guidelines for what may and what may not be said in arguments to a jury.\u2019 <em>(People v.

Furthermore, the mere occurrence of improper remarks does not by itself constitute reversible error. There must be an additional element for this conclusion to be reached. If we cannot say that the assailed argument constituted \u2018a material factor in the conviction\u2019 (People v. Clark, 52 Ill.2d 374, 390, 288 N.E.2d 363); must have resulted in \u2018substantial prejudice to the accused\u2019 (People v.

Trice, 127 Ill.App.2d 310, 319, 262 N.E.2d 276), then we must necessarily conclude that no prejudicial error resulted from the argument.\u201d 17 Ill.App.3d at 46-47, 308 N.E.2d at 110.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">With this background we turn now to a consideration of the instant cases \u2014 in neither of which the trial judges gave any instructions to the respective juries concerning the alleged improper remarks by the respective prosecutors.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-9\">The <em>Wilhelm </em>Case</p>\n<p id=\"b451-10\">When the assistant prosecutor in his opening remarks made reference to \u201cthe hue and cry of police protection\u201d and advised the jury that this was their \u201cchance \u2014 this is your occasion to do something about it,\u201d it appears that his remarks were not \u201ccarefully constructed <em>in toto </em>before the event\u201d and his improvisation \u201cresult[ed] in syntax left imperfect and meaning less than crystal clear.\u201d <em>Donnelly v. DeChristoforo, supra. </em>Indeed, in the syntax used it might <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>suggest at most a \u201cslip of the tongue, not unknown in extemporaneous speaking.\u201d <em>Orebo v. United States, supra, </em>citing <em>Pacman v. United States, </em>144 F. 2d 562 (9th Cir. 1944). The reference to \u201cpolice protection\u201d seems by itself ambiguous, although the prosecutor had theretofore advised the jury that the crimes charged \u2014 robbery, assault with intent to rob, resisting arrest and violation of the handgun law \u2014 all involved a police officer as the victim of the designated crimes. At best, the totality of these opening remarks could be concluded to be an invocation of \u201claw and order\u201d or an exhortation unto the jury \u201cto do their duty,\u201d or an appeal to have law enforcement. <em>See </em>Annot., 78 A.L.R. 1465 (1932).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">In <em>Matthews v. State, </em>3 Md. App. 555, 240 A. 2d 325, <em>cert. denied, </em>251 Md. 750 (1968), the appellant contended that the trial court committed prejudicial error in failing to grant a motion for mistrial based upon the State\u2019s comment to the jury in closing argument that the jury \u201cacts as a protective force to the citizens of Montgomery County.\u201d The Court of Special Appeals found that there was no abuse of the discretion vested in the trial court in failing to grant the motion based upon such an argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">In <em>State v. Spears, </em>505 S.W.2d 92 (Mo. 1974), the prosecutor, in closing argument after first observing that the defendant was in jail, told the jury: \u201cLadies and Gentlemen, all this talk about crime and lack of law enforcement ends right here with you. The defendant is before you. The evidence has been presented to you. You are now the sole judge of the defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence. If you find the defendant guilty I am going to ask you in all justice to send him back to that jail over there where the other burglars are waiting to be tried.\u201d After an objection by the defense was overruled the prosecutor told the jury that \u201cWe are asking for justice now.. . . But right now the State of Missouri asks and insists on justice under the law as you see it.\u201d Such remarks were not held to be prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">In <em>Commonwealth v. Feiling, </em>214 Pa. Super. 207, 252 A. 2d 200, <em>allocatur denied, </em>252 A. 2d 200 (1969), the appellee\u2019s conviction for armed robbery was affirmed. During his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>summation to the jury the prosecutor told the jury that \u201cthey might place themselves in the position of having been robbed.\u201d The court, in holding that there was no abuse of discretion on the part of the trial court, which found the remarks \u201cnot sufficiently harmful, if indeed they be harmful in the law at all,\u201d stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-5\">\u201cAlthough appeals to prejudice and passion are not to be approved, we have held that a District Attorney in his arguments, within proper limits, may argue for law and order and remind the jury of the danger to the community posed by persons prone to resort to violence. <em>Commonwealth v. McHugh, </em>187 Pa.Super. 568, 145 A.2d 896 (1958). We hold that those limits were not exceeded in the present case although the District Attorney\u2019s remarks were directed to the individual jurors as members of the community. Generally it is for the trial judge to determine whether such remarks are so prejudicial as to require a new trial on that ground alone, or whether their effect was sufficiently attenuated by the rest of the argument as to have no effect on the verdict. <em>Kuchinic v. McCrory, </em>422 Pa. 620, 222 A.2d 897 (1966); <em>Smith v. Evans, </em>421 Pa. 247, 219 A.2d 310 (1966).\u201d 214 Pa.

App. 1963), where the appellant had been convicted of the murder of a policeman, the prosecutor, in his opening remarks to the jury, stated: \u201cSo bear that in mind, that you are the conscience of your community. You are going to speak out for this community and let the rest of the state know exactly what this community thinks about people that kill law officers.\u201d Such remarks were held to be \u201cclearly a plea for law enforcement and permissible under the holdings of <em>Scarborough v. State,\u201d </em>344 S.W.2d 886 (Tex. Crim. App. 1961), and <em>Lockett v. State, </em>155 Tex. Crim. 55, 231 S.W.2d 416 (1950). <em>See also Parks v. State, </em>400 S.W.2d 769 (Tex. Crim.

App. 294, 193 N.W.2d 363 (1972) (each of which was cited by appellant <em>Wilhelm). </em>In <em>Pennington </em>the prosecutor in closing argument told the jury: \u201cThe people of Nueces County expect you to put this man away\u201d ; in <em>Jackson </em>the prosecutor told the jury: \u201cLadies and gentlemen of the jury, you are being watched by the men and women of this county so that they can tell by your verdict your character and the kind of men and women you are in the county\u201d ; in <em>Emerson </em>the prosecutor told the jury: \u201cLet\u2019s get stern and severe with these damned \u2018coloreds\u2019 \u201d ; and in <em>Farrar, </em>involving a conviction for felonious assault upon a police officer, the prosecutor told the jury that, \u201cEvery day they\u2019re [policemen] called pigs and people assault them with their fists and words. You know they don\u2019t bring these things in. Those people are never charged with offenses. They don\u2019t bring these things into court unless they really happen. The point is the reason why they\u2019re here is this actually happened as the officers testified that it happened.\u201d He added, \u201cthat if the defendant in the opinion of the police and in <em>my opinion </em>were innocent of this charge, we would not be here right now.\u201d These remarks \u2014 stating the personal opinion of the prosecutor and of the police \u2014 were held to have \u201csubtly converted the presumption of innocence into a presumption of guilt.\u201d <em>See </em>Annot., 85 A.L.R.2d 1132 (1962), concerning the prejudicial effect of a prosecuting attorney\u2019s argument to a jury that the people of a city, county or community want or expect a conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\"><em>Kellum v. State, supra, </em>as in <em>Wilhelm, </em>involved an assault and battery upon a police officer in which the testimony disclosed that the defendant had used force in resisting a lawful arrest. In closing argument the State\u2019s Attorney read to the jury a magazine article giving a description of a \u201cpolice officer\u201d which can succinctly be described as a eulogy of a hypothetical or perhaps somewhat synthesized and idealized police officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>Chief Judge Bru\u00f1e for this Court, after citing from <em>Toomer v. State, swpra, </em>the holdings in <em>Glickman v. State, supra </em>and <em>Wood v. State, supra, </em>stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-5\">\u201cIn the instant case it is clear that the description objected to was not evidence outside the record which tends to connect the defendant with the crime, nor evidence that the trial was dominated by-prejudice and passion. While the statement could have been designed to arouse the sympathy of the jury for policemen in general, it is difficult to see how the jury could have been misled or prejudiced against Kellum because of the reading of it. . . . The jury, representing as it does the collective experience of the community, may be fairly presumed to have known, in general, the varied tasks and lot of a policeman and to have known the essential needs filled by police officers. Though the reading of such an effusion was, we think, certainly not to be commended and should, indeed, not have been permitted in the trial of the case, we are unable to find in it any such persuasive power or significance as might be expected to sway a jury of reasonable intelligence and ordinary human experience. We are, therefore, unable to conclude that any actual prejudice resulted from its reading.\u201d 223 Md. at 88, 162 A. 2d at 478.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">In <em>Westcoat v. State, supra, </em>the appellant had been convicted of the murder of a policeman and it was contended, <em>inter alia, </em>on appeal that the trial court had erroneously permitted the State\u2019s Attorney to argue improperly to the jury in making a reference to the \u201cslaying of the policeman\u201d and a characterization of the slain policeman as \u201cthis poor officer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">Judge Marbury, who delivered the opinion for the Court, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-8\">\u201cThe applicable principle here involved is set out in <em>Kellum v. State, </em>223 Md. 80, 87, 162 A. 2d 473:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-9\">\u2018In the absence of something to show that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>jury was misled or influenced to the prejudice of the prisoner by such remarks the lower Court would not have been justified in setting aside the verdict, nor would this Court be warranted in reversing the judgment appealed from.\u2019,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-5\">citing <em>Toomer v. State, </em>112 Md. 285, 76 Atl. 118, Chief Judge Bru\u00f1e, for the Court, went on to point out that although the statement objected to, a reading of an advertisement which listed the good qualities needed for police officers (the defendant having been convicted of assaulting a policeman) quite possibly should not have been allowed, this Court could not see how it could \u2018sway a jury of reasonable intelligence and ordinary human experience.\u2019 223 Md. at page 88. We find that the same principle applies here. They did not exceed the bounds of permissible argument.\u201d 231 Md. at 369-70, 190 A. 2d at 546-47.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">In our review, made from the cold print of the record, we must give due weight to the conclusion of the trial judge who witnessed the presentation and heard the actual remarks \u2014 in the context in which they were made, in the trial arena \u2014 and who found no prejudice. The alleged improper remark \u2014 at best an introduction to a possible invocation of \u201claw and order,\u201d or the commencement of an exhortation unto the jury \u201cto do their duty,\u201d or the inception of an appeal for law enforcement \u2014 was but one sentence in the extensive proceedings, singularly made and unrepeated. <em>See Chandler v. State, supra. </em>When counsel promptly objected, the trial judge admonished the prosecutor \u201cnot to go into the situation about police officer protection or anything else.\u201d Thereafter no alleged improper statement was uttered. The interruption of the remarks by objection, the bench conference and the abandonment of any reference to the idea apprised the jury that the trial court had \u201cvetoed\u201d the idea propounded. Any proclivity on the part of the prosecutor to continue such an harangue was terminated. The trial judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>was in the most advantageous position to evaluate any potential prejudice from the remark; by his ruling he found none. If in the trial environment he had sensed the likelihood of any prejudice he would have carried out the duty with which he was entrusted \u2014 under <em>Contee, supra </em>\u2014 and of which he was certainly aware \u2014 to instruct the jury to disregard such remark; the exigencies of the situation did not appear to him to require such a cautionary instruction. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">The remark was different both by its nature, content and materiality from those remarks which have been found, per se, to have constituted prejudice. It was not one \u201cscreaming out for the forceful interdiction of the trial judge\u201d as was found to have existed in <em>Reidy </em>and in <em>Conway. </em>The principles applied in <em>Clarke v. State, supra, Westcoat v. State, supra, Kellum v. State, supra, Wood v. State, supra, Glickman v. State, supra </em>and <em>Toomer v. State, supra, </em>are here controlling. The isolated remark which appears to have been the initiation of an appeal for law enforcement, or \u201cfor law and order,\u201d or unto the jury \u201cto do their duty,\u201d did not mislead or influence the jury to the prejudice of the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">The evidence concerning the appellant\u2019s guilt was not \u201cclose,\u201d but was rather \u201coverwhelming.\u201d The remark was \u201cunimportant\u201d and there was \u201cno evidence of a proceeding dominated by prejudice and passion.\u201d See <em>Wood v. State, supra. </em>Our examination of the entire proceedings compels the conclusion that the remark made in opening statement did not infect the defendant\u2019s trial with unfairness nor was it likely to prejudice him. <em>See Donnelly v. DeChristoforo, supra; Conway v. State, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">Although the purpose of an opening statement is to apprise, with reasonable succinctness, the trier of facts of the questions involved and what is expected to be proven, such opening statement does not need to be limited to a factual recitation of what is expected to be elicited from the prospective witnesses. Counsel are entitled to make what rhetoricians call an exordium \u2014 that part of the opening intended to make the listeners heed you and to prepare them <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>for that which is to follow.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We do not mean to suggest that the performing artists be given a \u201cbroad range\u201d in their efforts at advocacy. Each case must depend on its own peculiar facts and both counsel \u2014 for the prosecution as well as for the defense \u2014 are enjoined in their eloquence to circumspection, lest in their enthusiasm for their cause they create a condition which is likely or apt to instigate prejudice against the accused \u2014 or the prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">Lord Halsbury, L. C., in <em>Sharp v. Wakefield </em>[1891] A.C. 173, 179, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-6\">\u201c \u2018Discretion\u2019 means when it is said that something is to be done within the discretion of the authorities that that something is to be done according to the rules of reason and justice, not according to private opinion; according to law, and not humour. It is to be, not arbitrary, vague, and fanciful, but legal and regular. And it must be exercised within the limit, to which an honest man competent to the discharge of his office ought to confine himself.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">We find no abuse of the discretion vested in the trial court in refusing to grant a mistrial, nor any error in the court\u2019s failure, sua sponte, to give an instruction to the jury to disregard the comments made.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-8\">The <em>Cook </em>Case</p>\n<p id=\"b458-9\">Although it is fundamental that the argument of counsel should at all times be confined to the questions in issue and the evidence relating thereto adduced at the trial and such inferences, deductions and analogies as can reasonably and properly be drawn therefrom, it is proper for counsel to argue to the jury \u2014 even though evidence of such facts has not been formally introduced \u2014 matters of common knowledge or matters of which the court can take judicial notice. <em>See </em>53 Am.

When the prosecutor in closing argument told the jury that \u201cLast year some three hundred thirty people were murdered in Baltimore City,\u201d he made reference to a matter within their knowledge, proclaimed by bold headlines just 19 days previously.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">In a broad sense the term \u201cjudicial notice\u201d is used to denote both judicial knowledge (which courts possess) and common knowledge (which every informed individual possesses); and matters of common knowledge may be declared applicable to the case without proof. See <em>Bone v. General Motors Corp., </em>322 S.W.2d 916, 924 (Mo. 1959), concerning \u201clife expectancy\u201d where the court observed that it would be unrealistic that the jury actually knew the plaintiffs expectancy, but that a jury would have actual knowledge, and common knowledge that a person 35 years of age with no constitutional diseases or abnormalities might be expected to live for a substantial number of years in the absence of unexpected calamity.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">Jurors may be reminded of what everyone else knows, and they may act upon and take notice of those facts which are of such general notoriety as to be matters of common knowledge. <em>State v.

Elbert, 438 S.W.2d 164 [Mo.]; and see Anno., 78 A.L.R. at 1467.\u201d 485 P. 2d at 834.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b461-6\"><em>See also Fair v. State, </em>168 Ga. 409, 148 S. E. 144 (1929), where the prosecutor told the jury in final argument there were 561 murders in Georgia in 1922 and urged the imposition of the death sentence on the appellant. The Georgia court similarly pointed out that the statistics to which the Solicitor General referred were not matters of such common knowledge that the court could take judicial cognizance of their existence without proof, although the matter would be different if the subject-matter was one of such public notoriety that the court or jury could take judicial cognizance thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">Similarly, when the prosecutor here stated that he did not \u201cknow how many people were robbed in the city with weapons,\u201d he was again making reference to data widely publicized in the media and in effect asking the jurors for a \u201crecall\u201d of matters which were within their common knowledge and awareness.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">That Charles Dean had been one of the people murdered in 1972 was established by the testimony; that he as well as James Conyer, affectionately called \u201cPapa,\u201d were \u201cdefenseless\u201d was a valid argument to be made from the evidence concerning the description about how Dean and Conyer had been set upon by four assailants. \u201cPapa\u201d (Conyer) was blind in one eye; he had borrowed a dollar with which to purchase a pint of Italian Swiss Colony wine \u2014 indeed, the alcoholic refreshment was his singular personal property taken by the robbers.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-9\">That the assailants could be described as \u201cyoung toughs\u201d was abundantly supported by the testimony concerning the manner of the confrontation of Dean and Conyer by their robbers and from the demeanor and nature of the testimony given by both the appellant Cook and a co-defendant, Michael Walter Beaty, who undertook to exonerate not only himself, but Cook as well, and from the demeanor and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>appearance of another co-defendant, Leonard Mitchell Anderson, who, when called by the appellant, elected not to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">In <em>Ott v. State, supra, </em>the appellant, for the first time on appeal, made objection to two instances in the State\u2019s closing argument which he contended were prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">Judge Anderson, who delivered the opinion for the Court of Special Appeals, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-7\">\u201cThe first was when the prosecutor stated * * but I think that he (Mr. Ott) is the type of individual that fits the pattern of the State\u2019s theory of the case and that he is typically the type person who might do exactly what was done under the theory of the State\u2019s case.\u2019 Appellant contends that this refers to his prior convictions and it was therefore improper. A reading of the record discloses that this contention is not correct. It is apparent from the record that the prosecutor was referring to appellant\u2019s <em>demeanor </em>on the witness stand and <em>his actions at the time of the alleged crime. </em>The other instance was when the prosecutor stated that \u2018We are lucky we are not here today with a murder charge.\u2019 He then remarked that such situations <em>make Baltimore a big crime area. </em>We feel these remarks \u00e1re fair comment in argument and certainly do not merit reversal. They are neither misleading nor prejudicial to the appellant. See <em>Day v. State, 2 </em>Md. App. 334; <em>Holbrook v. State, </em>6 Md. App. 265; <em>Chandler v. State, </em>7 Md.

(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b462-10\">When the Assistant State\u2019s Attorney made reference to \u201cyoung toughs\u201d it is patent that in his argument he was referring to the demeanor of the appellant and two of his co-defendants called as witnesses in his behalf and the actions of the assailants at the time of the homicide and robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-11\">In the early stages of Cook\u2019s trial \u2014 in connection with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>opening statement \u2014 the trial judge instructed the jury that what is said to them by the lawyers was \u201cnot evidence\u201d ; he further advised the jury that anything said by counsel \u2014 whether for the State or the defense \u2014 in closing argument was \u201cnot evidence in the case,\u201d that \u201cclosing argument is exactly what the word implies; merely argument to persuade you . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">The assistant prosecutor at the beginning of his summation told the jury that the testimony from the witness stand and the evidence from the very exhibits \u201cis all that you will use to determine your verdict,\u201d he again advised the jury that \u201cwhat I am telling you now is not evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">What the Court observed in <em>Esterline v. State, supra, </em>\u201cIt is not to be presumed that a body of competent and honest men, sworn to try the issue of the traverse upon the evidence produced before them would permit the statement to influence their finding,\u201d is particularly applicable here in view of the fact that the jury was on three occasions advised \u2014 by the court and by the prosecutor \u2014 that the statements of counsel were not evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">In <em>Witcher v. State, supra, </em>Judge Thompson, writing for the Court of Special Appeals, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-8\">\u201cThe rule in Maryland concerning the misstatements of law or fact in a closing argument is that unless it appears the jury was actually misled or was likely to have been misled or influenced to the prejudice of the accused, a reversal of a judgment of conviction will not be justified. <em>Holbrook v. State, </em>6 Md. App. 265, 250 A. 2d 904. See <em>Reidy v. State, </em>8 Md. App. 169, 259 A. 2d 66. If we assume the argument to have been improper, the trial court\u2019s instructions to the jury concerning statements and arguments of counsel not to be considered evidence, and his direction that they find their facts only from \u2018what you have heard from the witness stand and the exhibits which have been received,\u2019 sufficiently eliminated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>any possibility of prejudice.\u201d 17 Md.

It is the climax of the case. It is the opportunity to rescue a cause until that time perhaps seemingly lost. It calls for every skill the advocate possesses. It calls for more than skill \u2014 it is a summons to his courage, a testing ground of his character, a trial of his logic and reasoning powers, his memory, his patience and his tact, his ability to express himself in convincing words; in short, it is an assay of every power of persuasion he possesses. Small wonder, then, that there have been few great summations.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">The facts here are inapposite to those in <em>Viereck v. United States, </em>318 U. S. 236 (1943); <em>Brown v. United States, </em>370 F. 2d 242 (D.C. Cir. 1966); <em>Handford v. United States, </em>249 F. 2d 295 (5th Cir. 1957); <em>Turk v. United States, </em>20 F. 2d 129 (8th Cir. 1927); and <em>People v. Sawhill, </em>299 Ill. 393, 132 N. E. 477 (1921); (all cited by the appellant). <em>Viereck </em>was a prosecution for failing to register as a \u201cforeign agent\u201d and the United States Attorney made an impassioned plea reminding the jury, \u201cThis is war, harsh, cruel, murderous war,\u201d and that there were those plotting at that very moment their and his death. In <em>Brown </em>the prosecutor told the jury that unless they reached the conclusion that the defendants had assaulted the police officers \u201cthen this city [District of Columbia] must have martial law.\u201d In <em>Handford, </em>a prosecution for possessing untaxed liquor, where the evidence was circumstantial, in addition to the injection of a racial epithet, the prosecutor made an argument found to be prejudicial in blaming the defendant for drunken drivers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>responsible for highway accidents, particularly accidents to children. In <em>Turk, </em>another liquor law violation, the prosecutor argued that the defendant must have been a wholesale dealer in beer because he sold 100 to 300 bottles every other night and that \u201cIf a guilty man goes free you are adding more flame to the fire of the crime wave sweeping the country.\u201d In <em>Sawhill </em>the prosecutor made reference in his argument to lawless outbreaks of the inhabitants who had destroyed public buildings in other communities following the failure of juries to convict persons charged with atrocious crimes \u2014 where the defendant was being prosecuted for running a \u201cconfidence game.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">The prosecutor in <em>Cook </em>in his closing argument made only reasonable and legitimate inferences from the facts which had been offered in evidence, from the facts which were of such general notoriety as to be matters of common knowledge and matters within the cognizance of the jury from their own observations.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">The trial judge was similarly in the most advantageous position to evaluate from the remarks any potential prejudice to the defendant; by his rulings in refusing to grant a mistrial he found none. His cautionary instructions at the outset of the case when coupled with the statements of the prosecutor concerning the fact that what counsel stated was not evidence, did not from the exigencies of the situation require him, sua sponte, to give any additional cautionary advice to the jury. The facts in Cook\u2019s case are controlled by the principles applied in <em>Donnelly v. DeChristoforo, supra; Clarke v. State, supra; Wood v. State, supra; Cohen v. State, supra; </em>and <em>Esterline v. State, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">Here, as well, the evidence against Cook was \u201coverwhelming,\u201d there was \u201cno evidence of a proceeding dominated by prejudice and passion.\u201d <em>See Wood v. State, supra. </em>Our examination of the entire proceedings convinces us that the remarks made in closing argument were not beyond the scope of permissible comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">The statement of Mr. Justice Burton, who delivered the majority opinion for the United States Supreme Court in <em>Darcy v. Handy, </em>351 U. S. 454 (1956), seems particularly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>appropriate to the cases of both <em>Wilhelm </em>and <em>Cook. </em>He stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">\u201cWhile this Court stands ready to correct violations of constitutional rights, it also holds that \u2018it is not asking too much that the burden of showing essential unfairness be sustained by him who claims such injustice and seeks to have the result set aside, and that it be sustained not as a matter of speculation but as a demonstrable reality.\u2019 <em>Adams v.

State, </em>238 Md. 11, 20, 207 A. 2d 456 (1965) (emphasis added). Yet, neither the majority of this Court nor of the Court of Special Appeals fully applied that test to the statements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>made here. Both have proceeded on the premise that, in any event, prejudice must be shown. I do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">In resting their decision upon the absence of such prejudice, both courts have misapplied our earlier decision in <em>Wood v. State, </em>192 Md. 643, 65 A. 2d 316 (1949). In that case, which involved comments made during argument to the jury rather than opening statement, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-6\">\u201cIt is quite true that appeals to class prejudice or to passion are improper and may so poison the minds of jurors that an accused may be deprived of a fair trial. However, unless it appears that the jury were actually misled or were likely to have been misled or influenced to the prejudice of the accused by the remarks of the State\u2019s Attorney, this Court will not be justified in reversing a judgment of conviction solely because of <em>intemperate remarks made in the ardor of advocacy. . . </em>.\u201d 192 Md. at 652 (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">We are not confronted here with mere \u201cintemperate remarks made in the ardor of advocacy.\u201d It is difficult to imagine how that atmosphere could even exist at the very outset of a trial. The prosecutor was delivering the first paragraph of his opening statement, presumably only moments after the trial had commenced. Opening statements by the prosecuting attorney, or by plaintiff\u2019s counsel in a civil case, may well be the only \u201cscript\u201d to be utilized in the trial of any case.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">The remarks made here cannot be sloughed off as a mere \u201cslip of the tongue\u201d or as an \u201cimprovisation.\u201d Nor am I able to detect the \u201cexigencies\u201d referred to by the majority. On the contrary, one can only infer that the message intended to be conveyed by the prosecutor\u2019s words was \u201c . . . carefully constructed <em>in toto </em>before the event. . <em>Donnelly v. DeChristoforo, </em>416 U. S. 637, 94 S. Ct. 1868, 1873, 40 L.Ed.2d 431 (1974). I agree with the majority below that the comments were improper <em>per se, </em>but I would also hold that they were made in bad faith and therefore compelled reversal, <em>Clarke v. State, supra, </em>238 Md. at 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>Furthermore, I think that there was error even if we apply \u201csubstantial prejudice\u201d or \u201cactual prejudice\u201d as the test. This was a one-day trial, not a protracted proceeding. Thus, it does not stretch the imagination to assume that the words of the prosecutor were fresh in the minds of the jurors when they retired to deliberate. It is equally important to note that nothing was said to the jury following the objection by defense counsel. The jurors could logically have assumed from the court\u2019s silence following the bench conference that the objection had been overruled, thereby suggesting its approbation of the remarks.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">A number of the authorities cited by the majority, almost all of which dealt with jury argument rather than opening statements, appear to have turned on whether the trial judge issued a curative instruction following improper comment. No such instruction was given here, and under the circumstances of this case that failure alone established prejudice. As the majority has noted in part, we said in <em>Contee v. State, </em>223 Md. 575, 165 A. 2d 889 (1960):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-6\">\u201c... We point out, however, that the State\u2019s Attorney has an obligation to refrain from making any remark within the hearing of the jury which is <em>likely or apt </em>to instigate prejudice against the accused. We further point out that, while the granting or refusal of a mistrial is a matter lying within the sound discretion of the trial court, the court, nevertheless, <em>in addition to sustaining an objection </em>to an improper remark or misconduct, is also entrusted with <em>further responsibility to caution or reprimand </em>the State\u2019s Attorney as the exigencies of the situation may require <em>and to forthwith instruct the jury </em>to disregard the unwarranted remarks and conduct of the prosecuting attorney.\u201d 223 Md. at 584 (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">I find nothing in any of our other prior decisions that imposes an absolute requirement upon defense counsel to request a curative instruction. Given the impropriety of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>comments, which was tacitly recognized by the trial judge, the objection and motion were sufficient to cast upon the court the responsibility for curative action. The failure to properly instruct the jury at any time before it retired and the refusal to grant a mistrial, taken together, constituted an abuse of discretion. I would reverse and remand for a new trial. Judge Eldridge authorizes me to state that he concurs in this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
