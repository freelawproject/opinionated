In <em>Giant of Maryland, Inc. v. State\u2019s Attorney for Prince George\u2019s County, </em>267 Md. 501, 298 A. 2d 427, <em>appeal dismissed, </em>412 U. S. 915 (1973) we held that the Sunday closing law applicable to Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland Code (1957, 1971 Repl. Vol.) Art. 27, \u00a7 534H (b) 1-3 did not permit Giant to avail itself of the exemption accorded drugstores, delicatessens and bakeries, because although Giant operated a pharmacy, a delicatessen and a bakery within its store, its business was the general sale of food products.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">The second case, <em>Dart Drug Corp. v. Hechinger Co., </em>272 Md. 15, 320 A. 2d 266 (1974), involved the interpretation of a similar Sunday closing law, Code (1957, 1971 Repl. Vol.) Art. 27, \u00a7 534J applicable to Montgomery County. The same Hechinger Company (Hechinger) which is the appellant here had instituted an action for declaratory and injunctive relief in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County against Dart Drug Corporation, Drug Fair, Inc. and Peoples Drug Stores, Inc., alleging that the defendants\u2019 stores, which sold 67% of the same items sold by Hechinger, were permitted to remain open on Sunday, while Hechinger was required to be closed. In that case, we found that the three defendants did not qualify for the statutory exemption accorded to \u201c[d]rugstores whose basic business is the sale of drugs and related items\u201d because their basic business was not the sale of drugs. We modified the trial court\u2019s order, and affirmed as modified a declaration and order enjoining and restraining the defendants from conducting business on Sunday in any store which regularly employed on weekdays more than six persons on any one shift.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>This case began in June of 1973 when the State\u2019s Attorney filed a petition for injunctive relief against Hechinger in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County, seeking to enforce the same Sunday closing law which had been at issue in <em>Giant of Maryland, Inc. v. State\u2019s Attorney for Prince George\u2019s County, supra, </em>267 Md. 501. From a decree granting injunctive relief, Hechinger appealed to the Court of Special Appeals which affirmed in <em>Hechinger Co. v. State\u2019s Attorney for Prince George\u2019s County, </em>19 Md. App. 707, 313 A. 2d 715 (1974). We granted certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\">Code (1957, 1971 Repl. Vol.) Art. 27, \u00a7 534H (the Statute) which is at issue here, provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-5\">\u201c(a) In Prince George\u2019s County, except as specifically in this section otherwise provided, it is unlawful on Sunday for any wholesale or retail establishment to conduct business for labor or profit in the usual manner and location or to operate its establishment in any manner for the general public. It shall not cause, direct, permit, or authorize any employee or agent to engage in or conduct business on its behalf on Sunday.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-6\">\u201c(c) Nothing in this section applies to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-7\">1. Farmers</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-8\">2. Nurserymen</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-9\">3. Small business with not more than six (6) persons on any one shift with the exception of persons or retailers engaged in the sale of motor vehicles.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b728-10\">Hechinger, which advertises as \u201cThe World\u2019s Most Unusual Lumber Yards\u201d operates two stores in Prince George\u2019s County: one at Marlow Heights and one at Prince George\u2019s Plaza Shopping Center, near Hyattsville. In <em>Dart </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number><em>Drug Corp. v. Hechinger Co., supra, </em>272 Md. at 18-19, Hechinger\u2019s president described his company as being \u201cin the lumber, hardware and general merchandise business\u201d or, alternatively, as being in the \u201chome center business.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b729-4\">Sergeant Robert R. Ross, of the Prince George\u2019s County police department, testified that on the morning of Sunday, 3 June 1973, he visited the Hechinger store at Marlow Heights. He found some 75 customers and 24 employees in the store. From Ross\u2019 testimony can be culled the items he saw for sale in the store. They included: building materials, appliances, lawn furniture, shrubbery, evergreen trees, swimming pool accessories, machine tools, windows, door frames, paint, hardware supplies, iceboxes, washing machines, stoves, barbecue grills, hibachis, charcoal, picnic supplies, chemicals, insecticides, decorative bark, stones, fencing, fertilizers, flower tubs, boxes, pots, garden carts, hand tools, hoses, lawn sweepers and mowers, sprayers, spreaders, storage buildings, plastic pipe. In response to a question, Ross estimated that less than one fourth of the store was devoted to garden related items (as distinguished from nursery stock, most of which was displayed outside) and that five or six employees were in that area.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">At the conclusion of Ross\u2019 testimony, it was stipulated that Hechinger\u2019s Hyattsville store, also open on that day, was not substantially different. The only other witness was John W. Hechinger, the company\u2019s president, who testified for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">Hechinger said that his company sold some 220 items of growing stock, including evergreens, roses, flowering shrubs, fruit trees, annuals and bedding plants; that in the last 3 years about 100 employees had attended a course in lawn care given by the O. M. Scott Company in Marysville, Ohio, and that the outside area where most of the nursery stock was sold occupied an area about one third the size of the store. It was Mr. Hechinger\u2019s opinion that approximately 50% of his company\u2019s sales were derived from what he regarded as nursery related items, which included barbecue grills, hibachis, charcoal, birdhouses, chemicals, insecticides, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>decorative bark, stones, brick, fencing, fertilizers, flower tubs, boxes, pots, fountains, furniture (metal and/or wood), garden carts, gloves, grass catchers, shrubs, rosebushes, flats, bulbs, hammocks, hand tools, shovels, hoes, rakes, spades, weeders, forks, shears, pruners, clippers, loppers, trowels, hoses, sprinklers, nozzles, sprinkling cans, insect foggers, lawn sweepers, patio stones, blocks, peat moss, \u201call other soil conditioners,\u201d power tools, saws, edgers, trimmers, tillers, grass seed, flower seed, vegetable plant seed, sprayers, spreaders, statuary, storage buildings, trellises, wheelbarrows, patio decking, plastic pipes, cement, sand, drain tile, creosote, and sod.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">On cross examination, Mr. Hechinger further explained his answer by saying that his company\u2019s sales are about equally divided between items used inside the house and items used outside the house. No evidence of sales figures 'by categories was introduced.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">Hechinger challenges the result reached by the trial court and affirmed by the Court of Special Appeals on the ground that it was posited on a narrow definition of a nursery as a place where plant life is propagated, with the natural consequence that a nurseryman, within the contemplation of Art. 27, \u00a7 534H (c) 2 is the operator of just such a nursery.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">Hechinger, relying on determinations reached in the context of zoning law, <em>Anderson v. Humble Oil &amp; Refining Co., </em>226 Ga. 252, 174 S.E.2d 415 (1970); <em>Suburbia Gardens Nursery, Inc. v. County of St. Louis, </em>377 S.W.2d 266 (Mo. 1964); <em>Town of Needham v. Winslow Nurseries, Inc., </em>330 Mass. 95, 111 N.E.2d 453 (1953) and <em>A. C. Nurseries, Inc. v. Brady, </em>278 App. Div. 974, 105 N.Y.S.2d 933 (1951), <em>see </em>67 C.J.S. <em>Nursery </em>(1950, Supp. 1974), would have us hold that we should give a broader scope than did the chancellor or the Court of Special Appeals to the term nurseryman as used in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>the Statute. Although we are fully prepared to do this, it will be of little comfort to Hechinger, since in our view a correct result was reached below, but for what we regard as the wrong reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-4\">Turning to the question of statutory construction, it should be noted that the Statute was last before the General Assembly in 1969, when it was amended by Chapters 277 and 282 of the Laws of 1969.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> By then, the legislature must have had in mind the situation which had developed in the metropolitan areas of Baltimore and Washington, where many nurserymen customarily offered for sale plant material which had been propagated and raised elsewhere, either by the seller or by others. It is too late in the day to argue that the exemption extended by the Statute to nurserymen may be availed of only by the propagator and grower of plant materials, since the Statute must be construed in the light of customs and usages existing at the time of its enactment or amendment, <em>Town of Needham v. Winslow Nurseries, Inc., supra, </em>330 Mass, at 99, 111 N.E.2d at 455-56; <em>cf. Williams v. Loyola College, </em>257 Md. 316, 328, 263 A. 2d 5, 11 (1970); 2A C. Sands, Sutherland Statutory Construction \u00a7 47.28, at 141-42 (4th ed. 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">Even this concession, however, affords no solace to Hechinger, because Hechinger, on the facts before us, can no more be regarded as a nurseryman than the wide ranging operations of Giant Food or Dart Drug could be regarded as those of a drugstore, for purposes of the Sunday closing laws.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The record clearly shows that while Hechinger may not be a lumberyard, its business is that of a seller of a wide range of general merchandise. Even if we apply Mr. Hechinger\u2019s somewhat amorphous inside/outside test it is clear that products sold for use outside the home, by his definition, include much more than plant materials and nursery related items \u2014 such as insecticides, fertilizers, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>peat moss, mulch, potting soil, pots, seeds, bulbs, house plants, small hand tools, and the like, all of which are customarily sold by nurseries in the Washington metropolitan area. <em>Town of Needham v. Winslow Nurseries, Inc., supra, </em>on which Hechinger relies, recognized at 101-02 of 330 Mass, and at 457 of 111 N.E.2d that nursery stock not grown on the premises may be sold by a nursery, but held that sales of items other than \u201cfungicides, insecticides, chemicals, peat moss, humus, mulches, and fertilizers\u201d were not incidental to the operation of a nursery, a permitted use in an area zoned residential. <em>See also Suburbia Gardens Nursery, Inc. v. County of St. Louis, supra, </em>377 S.W.2d at 272-73. Difficult as it may be on the record before us to characterize Hechinger\u2019s principal business, which may well be that of a home center, of a hardware store, of an appliance store, or of a retail lumber dealer, it is certainly not that of a nursery.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">There were introduced in evidence photographs of other nursery operations which, according to Mr. Hechinger, were open on Sunday. Two of them were adjuncts to department stores, which were otherwise closed. A third was at a hardware store, which seemingly operated with six or fewer employees. Another was a nursery which, as far as we could ascertain from the photographs, sold only nursery related items.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">Hechinger\u2019s second contention is that the Statute is so vague, ambiguous, uncertain and insusceptible of definition as to amount to a denial of due process. We have recognized that due process is violated only when a statute is so vague that persons of ordinary intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application, <em>MacLeod v. City of Takoma Park, </em>257 Md. 477, 481, 263 A. 2d 581, 583 (1970). The compelling answer to this contention is that the same argument was made as regards the same statute in <em>Giant of Maryland v. State\u2019s Attorney for Prince George\u2019s County, supra, </em>267 Md. at 514-15, where we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-6\">\u201cBut the imperfect drafting of \u00a7 534H does not compel a holding that the statute is vague and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>indefinite in a constitutional sense, as urged by Giant. On the contrary, bearing in mind that \u00a7 534H is a penal statute, we think that, as written, it is sufficiently explicit to enable a person of ordinary intelligence to ascertain with a fair degree of precision what it prohibits and what conduct on his part will render him liable to its penalties; it does not, therefore, affront the constitutional guarantees of due process.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b733-4\"><em>See also Rebe v. State\u2019s Attorney for Prince George\u2019s County, </em>262 Md. 350, 277 A. 2d 616 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">Because we regard the result reached below as the right one, we shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed; stay order vacated; costs to be paid by appellant.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b728-11\">. Chapter 384 of the Laws of 1974, effective 1 July 1974 amended \u00a7 534H (c) 3, so that it now reads: \u201cAny business with not more than six persons on any one shift on Sunday with the exception of persons or retailers engaged in the sale of motor vehicles.\u201d A similar change was made in \u00a7 534J (c) 3, applicable to Montgomery County.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b730-7\">. Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary of the English Language 1674, 1675 (2d ed. 1944) defines a nursery as \u201c[a] place where trees, shrubs, vines, etc., are propagated for transplanting or for' use as stocks for grafting; a plantation of young trees or other plants\u201d and a nurseryman as \u201c[o]ne who conducts or cultivates a nursery.\u201d This was the test applied by the older cases, collected in 67 C.J.S. <em>Nursery </em>at 2-3 (1950).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b731-6\">.

State\u2019s Attorney for Prince George\u2019s County, 267 Md. 501, 298 A. 2d 427, <em>appeal dismissed, </em>412 U. S. 915 (1973); Dart Drug Corp. v. Hechinger Co., 272 Md. 15, 320 A. 2d 266 (1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b733-7\">\n<em>O\u2019Donnell, J.,</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AJv\">\n<em>concurring:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b733-8\">I concur with the result reached by the majority, but I would sustain the grant of injunctive relief upon the more restricted ground that the appellant, Hechinger Company, is not within the exception set forth in the Maryland Code (1957, 1971 Repl. Vol.), Art. 27, \u00a7 534 H (c) (2), in that none of the merchandise sold by it brings it within the definition of a \u201cnurseryman\u201d as that term is known and defined. I cannot concur that in 1968 when the General Assembly enacted that section, nor in 1969 when the \u201cSabbath breaking\u201d statute was last before it, that the legislature \u201cmust have had in mind the situation which had developed in the metropolitan areas of Baltimore and Washington, where many nurserymen customarily offered for sale plant material which had been propagated and raised elsewhere, either by the seller or by others.\u201d Nor do I concur with the view that \u201c[i]t is too late in the day to argue that the exemption extended by the Statute to nurserymen may be availed of only by the propagator and grower of plant materials.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b733-9\">What the majority seems to suggest is that if the appellant is selling at retail upon his premises baled, balled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>or potted trees, bushes, plants and flowers \u2014 though purchased at wholesale elsewhere from the propagator and grower of such plant materials \u2014 and sells as well only nursery-related items, that the appellant would thus be a \u201cnurseryman\u201d and within the exemption in the statute. The majority then concludes that because of the adjunct retail sales by the appellant of non-nursery-related items and a wide range of general merchandise, it is not the operator of a nursery.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\">The first reference to any such kindred exemption appears in the Code (1957, 1967 Repl. Vol.) Art. 27, \u00a7 521 (b) \u2014 a codification of Ch. 811 of the Acts of 1959 \u2014 which permitted the sale on Sunday in Anne Arundel County of \u201cartificial and natural flowers and shrubs\u201d together with other specified limited merchandise. Subsection (f) in the same section \u2014 a codification of Ch. 236 of the Acts of 1966 \u2014 excepted from the application of the \u201cSabbath breaking\u201d statute the operation in Allegany County of certain retail establishments, included among which were <em>\u201cnurseries </em>or <em>shops selling flowers and plants, or roadside vending stands selling </em>fruits, vegetables or <em>plants and flowers </em>\u201d \u2014 provided that during the entire time such establishment was open on a Sunday, not more than three (3) persons were employed or working. (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">The exception here in issue, set forth in Art. 27, \u00a7 534 H (c), as applicable to Prince George\u2019s County, was enacted by Ch. 421 of the Acts of 1968. The same subsection, identical in form and content and codified as Art. 27, \u00a7 534 J (c), as applicable to Montgomery County, was enacted by Ch. 630 of the Acts of 1968. The same exceptions, now codified as Art. 27, \u00a7 534 L (c), was enacted by Ch. 686 of the Acts of 1968, as applicable to Baltimore County. The following year by Ch. 764 of the Acts of 1969, the General Assembly enacted identical exceptions, now codified as Art. 27, \u00a7 534 M (c), for Harford and Wicomico Counties.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">By Chapters 343, 681 and 718 of the Acts of 1973, the identical provisions as are contained in Art. 27, \u00a7 534 H (c), were similarly enacted as applicable respectively to Anne Arundel and Calvert Counties (Art. 27, \u00a7 534N), Washington <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>County (Art. 27, \u00a7 5340), and Frederick County (Art. 27, \u00a7 534Q). By comparison, Ch. 744 of the Acts of 1973, codified as \u00a7 534R, in subsection (c)(3) exempts as \u201ctypes of business\u201d \u201cagricultural activities including florists, nurserymen and farmers, and commercial fishing\u201d for Harford County.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b735-4\">Each of those respective sections in Art. 27 provides in subsection (b) thereof:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-5\">\u201cNotwithstanding any provision of this section, the operation of any of the following types of retail establishments is allowed on Sunday:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-6\">1. Drug stores whose principal business is the sale of drugs and related items.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-7\">2. Delicatessens whose principal business is the sale of delicatessen and related food items.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-8\">3. Bakeries and bakeshops.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-9\">4. Gasoline stations whose principal business is the sale of gasoline, oil, and other automobile maintenance items.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b735-10\">The majority, by their interpretation of \u201cnurserymen,\u201d have in effect added an additional classification to subsection (b) in Art. 27, \u00a7 534H, which in effect would read \u201cStores whose principal business is the sale of trees, shrubs, plants and flowers, and nursery-related items.\u201d Such classification and exemption was not created by the General Assembly; rather it chose to use the limited term \u201cnurserymen.\u201d It could have exempted \u201cNurseries or shops selling flowers and plants,\u201d as was done by Ch. 811 of the Acts of 1959, for Anne Arundel County, but it did not. When the classification \u201cnurserymen\u201d was used in the respective statutes applicable to the various counties that word had a plain and definite meaning and as such is limited, as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>majority recognizes, to \u201c \u2018[o]ne who conducts or cultivates a nursery,\u2019 \u201d and according to the dictionary definitions, a nursery \u201cis a place where trees, shrubs, plants, and so forth, are propagated from seed or otherwise for transplanting, for use as stock for grafting and for sale.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See Piekos v. Bachand, </em>333 Mass. 211, 129 N.E.2d 890 (1955), quoting with approval that same definition set forth in <em>Town of Needham v. Winslow Nurseries, Inc., </em>330 Mass. 95, 111 N.E.2d 453 (1953). <em>See also Suburbia Gardens Nursery, Inc. v. County of St. Louis, </em>377 S.W.2d 266 (Mo. 1964); 67 C.J.S. <em>Nursery </em>(1950, Supp. 1974); and 58 Am.Jur.2d <em>Occupations, Trades and Professions </em>\u00a7 1 (1971) (concerning the regulation of \u201cnurserymen\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\">The Chancellor (Bowen, J.) \u2014 of no little experience with agronomy \u2014 in holding that the appellant was not a \u201cnurseryman,\u201d succinctly stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-5\">\u201cA nurseryman is by definition one who conducts or operates a nursery, . . . but we are talking about here nursery in the agricultural sense. That, we think, is not difficult to glean because nurseryman follows right after farmers, [by statutory arrangement] which is the first one, so if by nothing else in the statute by the arrangement we apprehend they are talking about nursery in the sense as it applies to agriculture as opposed to any other kind of nursery you find in the dictionary. Now a nursery is by definition an operation which concerns itself with propagation of plant material, or with the propagation of certain forms of animal life. We hold as a matter of fact that that is the definition intended by the statute, none other having been offered in the statute; that it is as a matter of fact susceptible of precise and exact definition and therefore that the defendant\u2019s argument that this section makes the statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>unconstitutional for vagueness or lack of definiteness or certainty must fail.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-4\">. . . With this contention, [that Hechinger Company is a \u201cnurseryman\u201d] gentlemen, we are unable to agree as in the view the Court takes of the matter the critical operation which makes something a nursery and the operator a nurseryman is that part of the operation which is critical to the definition of nursery, and that is not the selling at retail or wholesale of the products of the nursery but the propagation of the material which is sold. It is propagation which makes an operation a nursery as opposed to the distribution in the world of commerce or transfer to the ultimate consumer in the market place of the products of the nursery. Now this record is devoid of any evidence that the defendant propagates anything that he sells either in the green goods department or the seed department or any of the live, material products which he sells. As a matter of fact, the evidence would indicate that he does not because his testimony is that he must maintain in his stores certificates of origin for those plants which are sensitive and fall within the regulation promulgated by the various, governmental agencies which regulate the sale and distribution of live, plant material, agriculture products and related items. It would make as much sense if one can argue with oneself to say that he is a fertilizer manufacturer because he sells fertilizer, or he is in the agri-chemical business because he sells the products of Ortho and others who manufacture these chemicals, or that he is in the cattle business because he sells cow manure. Nor is he in the lumber business by virtue of that fact, a tree farmer, or a saw mill, or in the foundry business because he sells ornamental casting to go on garden gates. ...\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">Judge Gilbert, who delivered the opinion for the Court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>Special Appeals<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> in affirming the grant of injunctive relief, reached the same conclusion. For the Court, he stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-4\">\u201cIn this Court the appellant argues that it \u2018offers more than 220 varieties of growing stock for public purchase. And common sense tells us that in order to stock such growing items . . . [appellant] would have to water and fertilize the plants periodically,\u2019 in order to sell \u2018good and healthy merchandise.\u2019 Appellant utilizes the quoted statement as a premise upon which it grounds a conclusion that because it fertilizes and waters plants in order to sell them, it is in the business of \u2018raising\u2019 plants for sale and thus is a nurseryman. We decline to adopt the appellant\u2019s line of reasoning.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-5\">The word \u2018nurseryman\u2019 is defined in <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary of the English Language </em>(unabr. ed. 1967) as, \u2018one whose occupation is the scientific cultivation of trees, shrubs and plants.\u2019 [Similar definitions are found in <em>Funk and Wagnall\u2019s Standard College Dictionary, </em>Text Edition (1963); <em>The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language </em>(1969); 67 C.J.S. <em>Nursery </em>3 (1950).] A nursery is defined by the same source to mean \u2018an area where trees, shrubs or plants are grown for transplanting, for use as stocks for budding and grafting, or for sale.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-6\">In <em>Town of Needham v. Winslow Nurseries, </em>330 Mass. 95, 100, 111 N.E.2d 453, 456 (1953), the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts said:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AlK\">\u2018According to dictionary definition a nursery is a place where trees, shrubs, plants, and so forth, are propagated from seed or otherwise for transplanting, for use as stock for grafting, and for sale. <em>See Miethke v. Pierce County, </em>173 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>Wash. 381, 23 P. 2d 405 [(1933)]; <em>Attorney General v. State Board of Judges, </em>38 Cal. 291, 296 [(1869)]; <em>Miller v. Baker, </em>[42 Mass. (1 Met.) 27 (1840)]; <em>Whitmarsh v. Walker, </em>[42 Mass. (1 Met.) 313 (1840)]; <em>Paine v. Board of Assessors of Town of Weston, </em>297 Mass. 173, 7 N.E.2d 584 [(1937)].\u2019 \u201d 19 Md. App. at 710-11, 313 A. 2d at 717.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b739-7\">He further stated for the Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-8\">\u201cThat the employees of the appellant water and fertilize the plants and shrubs that are part of the appellant\u2019s inventory, does not in our view place the appellant within the ambit of the definition of nurserymen.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-9\">We think the appellant was conducting a retail business and not, as the word is ordinarily and naturally used, a nursery. <em>Ergo, </em>appellant is not a nurseryman. If we were to adopt the argument urged upon us by the appellant we would in effect authorize every <em>bona fide </em>nurseryman in Prince George\u2019s County to engage in a retail business enterprise similar to that of the appellant. Nurserymen could then, under the guise of their statutory exemption, undertake to sell, on Sunday, the diverse and sundry items offered for sale by the appellant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-10\">The word <em>nurserymen </em>as used in art. 27, \u00a7 534H (c) 2 is not void for vagueness, but on the contrary is clearly definitive. . . .\u201d 19 Md. App. at 711-12, 313 A. 2d at 718.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b739-12\">I concur with these views. It was a special class of commercial enterprise which the legislature undertook quite limitedly to exempt; the General Assembly did not intend to exempt every business enterprise which purchases plants, shrubbery, flowers, etc., from \u201cnurserymen\u201d at wholesale and then undertakes on Sunday to sell these horticultural products at retail to the general public. The use of the word <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>\u201cfarmers\u201d in subsection (c) (1) and the use of the term \u201cnurserymen\u201d in juxtaposition by legislative arrangement in subsection (c) (2) would suggest that the General Assembly intended to encompass and classify together those who grow and propagate agricultural products with those who grow and propagate horticultural products \u2014 and not those retail sellers of such nursery products grown and propagated elsewhere.</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b736-7\">.
