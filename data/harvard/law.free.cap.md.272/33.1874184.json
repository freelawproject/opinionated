That charter, possibly to avoid some of the problems with which we were faced in <em>In re Legislative Districting, </em>271 Md. 320, 317 A. 2d 477 (1974), provided for a commission to establish councilmanic districts. This commission was to be \u201ccomposed of two members from each political party chosen from a list of five names submitted by the Central Committee of each political party which polled at least fifteen percent of the total vote cast for all candidates for the [County] Council in the immediately preceding regular election.\u201d The County Council by this same provision was to appoint one additional member of the Redistricting Commission (the Commission).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Commission was to select its chairman. No person was to be eligible as a member of the Commission if he held \u201cany elected office.\u201d It was provided in \u00a7 205 (b):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-6\">\u201cBy October 1 of the year prior to the year in which redistricting is to be effective, the Commission shall prepare, publish, and make available a plan of Councilmanic districts and shall present that plan, together with a report explaining it, to the Council. The plan shall provide for Councilmanic districts that are compact, contiguous, and substantially equal in population. No less than fifteen calendar days and no more than thirty calendar days after receiving the plan of the Commission, the Council shall hold a public hearing on the plan. If within seventy calendar days following presentation of the Commission\u2019s plan no other law establishing or re-establishing the boundaries of the Councilmanic districts has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>been enacted, then the plan, as submitted, shall become law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">The Commission was duly appointed. It submitted its report within the time specified in the charter. The County Council held the required public hearing. It did not \u201cwithin seventy calendar days following presentation of the Commission\u2019s plan\u201d enact any \u201cother law establishing or re-establishing the boundaries of the Councilmanic districts.\u201d The Commission\u2019s plan became law on November 27, 1973.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">Apparently, someone had misgivings relative to the proposal. Under date of November 30, pursuant to a request for \u201can opinion from the Department of Law as to whether or not the County Council ha[d] the power to rearrange and create election districts and precincts,\u201d the county attorney advised by letter that \u00a7 205 \u201cdoes not preclude the County Council from rearranging and creating election districts and precincts pursuant to their powers granted by the Legislature of the State of Maryland at other times.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The opinion recognized \u201cthat a defensible argument [might] be advanced that the Charter provisions for redistricting are exclusive and precludes the Council from redistricting in any other manner than that as provided in Section 205 of the Charter.\u201d Accordingly, it was suggested that if a new plan were enacted, then \u201cboth plans [should] be submitted to the court for judicial review under Article 31A of the Annotated Code of Maryland.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b55-8\">The County Council did enact a new plan, one differing from that proposed by the Commission and which had become law. The Board of Supervisors of Elections of Harford County filed a bill for declaratory judgment under Maryland Code (1957) Art. 31A. Parties defendant named in the proceeding were Harford County (the County) and the two individuals who had filed for election to the County Council from an altered councilmanic district. The persons who were members of the Commission, identifying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>themselves as \u201cresidents, voters, and taxpayers of Harford County, Maryland and as such [with] a direct interest in the outcome of the . . . proceedings,\u201d moved to intervene in order that \u201cthe issues presented . . . [might] be adequately and properly tried.\u201d Leave was granted and they filed an answer alleging that the Harford County Council was \u201cwithout authority to enact a law altering councilmanic districts except in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 205.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">The trial judge (Close, J.) filed a comprehensive and well reasoned opinion in which he said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-6\">\u201cIf the framers of the Charter had intended to allow the Council to redraw the district lines by means of an ordinary bill, they would have provided so. The procedure set forth was not done for idle reasons. It was clearly designed in a bipartisan fashion to prevent the unfortunate practice of \u2018gerrymandering\u2019 and the consequences which flow from it and to at least partially remove the important task of redefining Councilmanic districts from the field of partisan politics. Several protections are built into this procedure. All political parties of a certain size must be represented. No elected officials may serve on the commission. The plan must be submitted over one year prior to the next election. Public hearings must be held. Redistricting must be done every ten years, although there is nothing to indicate that it may not be done more often. It is true that the final decision on redistricting still rests with the Council, which is free to deal with the recommendations as it wishes within the seventy day period from the submission of the commission\u2019s report. They may either accept it or change it. This decision rightly rests in the hands of the duly elected members of the Council, who must start with the recommendations of a non-partisan panel of citizens.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-7\">\u201cThere is nothing to suggest that the procedure in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>Section 205 was not followed exactly as prescribed. All reports were submitted in a timely fashion and public hearings were held. The Council had seventy days to act on the plan of the commission and they failed to do so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-6\">\u201cThis Court therefore holds that the redistricting plan for the Councilmanic Districts prepared and submitted by the Commission on Redistricting became law and that Council Bill No. 73-67 is invalid and ineffective.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">A declaratory decree to that effect was signed.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-8\">The County promptly appealed to the Court of Special Appeals. It then immediately filed a petition with us for the writ of certiorari, pointing out that the filing deadline for the coming councilmanic election is 9:00 p.m. on July 1,1974, and that \u201cgreat uncertainty [would] prevail in the Councilmanic elections of Harford County\u201d until such time as we finally dispose of the matter. We granted the writ and advanced the case for argument. We shall here affirm the decision of the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-9\">The County reasons that under \u00a7 101 of its charter the County is to \u201chave all rights and powers of local self-government and home rule as are now or may hereafter be provided or necessarily implied by [that] Charter and by the Constitution and laws of the State of Maryland,\u201d and to have them \u201cas completely as though they were specifically enumerated in [that] Charter and no enumeration of rights or powers in [that] Charter shall be deemed exclusive or restrictive\u201d; that under Code Art. 25A, \u00a7 5 (A) the County has the power to \u201cenact local laws for such county, including the power to repeal or amend local laws thereof enacted by the General Assembly upon the matters covered by the express powers\u201d granted in Art. 25A; that under Art. 25A, \u00a7 5 (H) the County has power to \u201crearrange and create election districts and precincts\u201d; that under Art. 25A, \u00a7 5 (S) the County has power \u201cto pass all ordinances, resolutions or by-laws, not inconsistent with the provisions of [Art. 25A] or the laws of the State, as may be proper in executing and enforcing any of the powers enumerated in [\u00a7 5] or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>elsewhere in [Art. 25A], as well as such ordinances as may be deemed expedient in maintaining the peace, good government, health and welfare of the county\u201d; and that under Maryland Constitution Art. XI-A, \u00a7 3 it is vested with full legislative power subject to the provisions of Art. 25A and to any existing or later enacted public general laws. It says \u201c[g] ratification would not be afforded the purposes of home rule for the reasons which prompted it if the language of Section 5 (S) of Article 25A were not to be construed as a broad grant of power to legislate on matters not specifically enumerated in Article 25A and the language of that Section clearly indicates that such a construction is sound.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">In <em>Anne Arundel County v. Moushabek, </em>269 Md. 419, 306 A. 2d 517 (1973), we observed that a county charter \u201cis to its legislative body as the Constitution of Maryland is to the General Assembly of Maryland.\u201d We quoted from <em>Legg v. Annapolis, </em>42 Md. 203 (1875), where Judge Alvey said for the Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AFP\">\u201cA valid statute can only be passed in the manner prescribed by the Constitution, and when the provisions of that instrument, in regard to the manner of enacting laws, are wholly disregarded, in respect to a particular Act, it would seem to be a necessary conclusion that the Act, though having the forms of authenticity, must be declared to be a nullity. Otherwise the express mandatory provisions of the Constitution would be of no avail or force whatever.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 221.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">This Court has quoted many times from <em>Thomas v. Police Commissioner, </em>211 Md. 357, 127 A. 2d 625 (1956), where Judge Hammond said for the Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-8\">\u201cIt is a hornbook rule of statutory construction that, in ascertaining the intention of the Legislature, all parts of a statute are to be read together to find the intention as to any one part and that all parts are to be reconciled and harmonized if possible. <em>Bickel v. Nice, </em>173 Md. 1, 6; <em>Baltimore v. Deegan, </em>163 Md. 234, 238; <em>Pittman v. Housing </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number><em>Authority, </em>180 Md. 457, 463; <em>Maguire v. State, </em>192 Md. 615, 623; <em>Frazier v. Warfield, </em>13 Md. 279, 301. A corollary rule of construction is that if there is no clear indication to the contrary and it is reasonably possible, a statute is to be read so that no word, clause, sentence or phrase shall be rendered surplusage, superfluous, meaningless or nugatory. This was stated negatively in <em>Pressman v. State Tax Commission, </em>204 Md. 78, where it was noted that words in a statute may be rejected as surplusage if they are incapable of any sensible meaning or are repugnant to the rest of the statute and tend to nullify it <em>.\u2019\u2019Id. </em>at 361.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">It is important to note that Art. 25A, \u00a7 5 sets forth a preamble to the various powers granted to the chartered counties. That preamble states that the \u201cfollowing enumerated express powers are . . . granted to and conferred upon any county or counties which shall [t] hereafter form a charter under the provisions of said Article 11A of the Constitution.\u201d What the County seems to have overlooked here is that it is the \u201ccounty or counties\u201d upon which the power is conferred, not the legislative body of the \u201ccounty or counties.\u201d When the people of Harford County ratified this charter, the County was acting within the purview of Art. 25A, \u00a7 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">It is not uncommon for people to write into their basic charter a restriction upon the powers of their legislative body. Our own Declaration of Rights prohibits poll taxes; specifies that paupers ought not to be assessed for the support of the government; that \u201csanguinary Laws ought to be avoided as far as it is consistent with the safety of the State\u201d; that \u201cno Law to inflict cruel and unusual pains and penalties ought to be made in any case, or at any time, hereafter\u201d; that \u201cno <em>ex post facto </em>Law ought to be made; nor any retrospective oath or restriction be imposed, or required\u201d; that \u201cno Law to attaint particular persons of treason or felony, ought to be made in any case, or at any time, hereafter\u201d; and that \u201cthe Legislature [shall not] prescribe any other oath of office than the oath prescribed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>by [the] Constitution,\u201d to mention but a few of the limitations written into the basic law of this State. In this charter, \u00a7 201 creates a legislative body of seven members. In \u00a7 217 (d) a quorum is set at four members. Nevertheless, if the council desires to legislate a change in compensation for its members, under \u00a7 208 \u201can affirmative vote of at least five members of the Council\u201d is required. Moreover, although legislative bodies normally control the hour at which they convene, charter \u00a7 217 (c)'provides that \u201c[n]o session of the Council shall be scheduled earlier than six o\u2019clock P.M. on any day unless authorized by an affirmative vote of at least five members of the Council.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">The people of Harford County saw fit, in their wisdom, to place in their charter this provision for the creation of councilmanic districts. It must be assumed that they meant what they said. <em>See Prince George\u2019s Co. v. Beard, </em>266 Md. 83, 91, 291 A. 2d 636 (1972). It certainly cannot be said that the Harford County Charter clearly spells out that the provisions of \u00a7 101 of that charter are in- any way to override the provisions of \u00a7 205. If \u00a7 205 were not in the charter, then the council could, as Judge Close observed, \u201credistrict in any manner they wished, using any procedure they wished to establish, provided that both the procedure and the result were consistent with both Federal and State law and related sections of the Charter.\u201d The only way the charter can be construed so that \u201cno word, clause, sentence or phrase shall be rendered surplusage, superfluous, meaningless or. nugatory\u201d is to conclude, as we do conclude, that the citizens of Harford County intended by the enactment of \u00a7 205 of their charter , to restrict the County Council in enacting laws setting forth lines for councilmanic districts to the \u201cseventy calendar days following presentation of the Commission\u2019s plan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">\n<em>Decree affirmed; appellant to pay the costs; mandate to issue forthwith.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b54-8\">. The charter provision is reminiscent of the proposal of the Constitutional Convention of Maryland in 1968 in which Article 3, \u00a7 3.05 provided for a redistricting commission composed of two members appointed by \u201cthe presiding officer and the minority leader of each house\u201d and that \u201c[t]he governor [should] appoint an additional member who [should] serve as chairman of the commission.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b55-9\">. It will be recognized that election districts and precincts might be rearranged without alteration of Councilmanic districts.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
