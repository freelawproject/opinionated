Siegel and his wife got out of their automobile in the driveway of their home at 3318 Old Post Drive. Siegel remained to lock the car, his wife advanced toward the entrance of the home; as Siegel walked around the car he heard the footsteps of a person running and a voice which yelled, \u201cHold it, hold it, hold it.\u201d Turning, he saw a \u201ctall, slender-built young man, whose features were \u2018muffled\u2019 \u2014 as if covered by a stocking \u2014 pointing a rifle or shotgun from a distance of ten or twelve feet.\u201d A second man, within four or five feet of him, from across the hood of the car commanded him to turn over his wallet; when the wallet was placed on the hood of the car the unarmed assailant directed the removal of any money from the wallet and Siegel, across the hood of the car, handed-over approximately $35.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-10\">The evening was fairly misty and foggy; although there were no street lights on Old Post Drive, two outside post-lights were burning on the Siegel property, as were the lights on his neighbors\u2019 properties. The assailant to whom he had given the money and whose features he saw was \u201cof medium build, approximately 5'9\" to 5'10\" in height, with long, dark hair and a black moustache.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b295-11\">After being assured by Siegel that he had no more money, the robbers fled afoot westward toward the adjacent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>Stevenson Village Apartments. Mrs. Siegel promptly phoned the police and Siegel gave a description of his assailants over the phone. Within five minutes Siegel repeated the description to a county police officer who arrived at the home.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">Officer Hojnowski, cruising in a police car in the vicinity of Old Post Road, at 8:39 P.M. heard over the police radio a report of the robbery and a description of two white males running afoot toward the Stevenson Village Apartments. As he drove toward the apartments he noticed a 1969 Chevrolet containing two front-seat occupants driving westward on Old Post Road. Reversing the course of his police car and activating his signal he stopped the automobile on Old Post Road approximately 150 feet eastward of Stevenson Road. Alighting from the vehicle as the officer approached, the operator, unsolicitedly, asked if there was \u201cany trouble\u201d, stating that he \u201cwas lost.\u201d In addition to a white female seated on the right front seat the officer observed another white male \u201cslouched down\u201d \u2014 practically on the rear floor of the vehicle. The appellant Forster identified himself as the operator of the vehicle which was owned by the female passenger. The man \u201cslouched\u201d on the rear floor [Foster] did not then identify himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">Cpl. Litchfield, having heard over his police radio that the vehicle had been stopped by Officer Hojnowski, went to the Siegel residence, advised Siegel that the police had stopped a \u201csuspect vehicle\u201d and requested that Siegel accompany him to where the vehicle was stopped \u2014 about one block westward from the Siegel home. En route there was no conversation between Siegel and the corporal concerning the identity of the assailants \u2014 Siegel spoke about his combat experiences as a naval officer, but that he had never before had a gun pointed directly at him. When they arrived at the stopped vehicle there were four police cars parked in the vicinity.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">Siegel testified that when he was requested to accompany the police to the scene of the stopped vehicle he was told that they had \u201cpicked up two people that may fit the description [which he gave] and would he come to try to identify them\u201d; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>that when he confronted the persons at the stopped automobile \u2014 within approximately ten minutes of the robbery \u2014 he could have given a positive identification at that time of the man to whom he had handed the money \u2014 had he been there so asked by the police, but the police were concerned \u201cabout securing the rights of the alleged suspects.\u201d He further testified that \u201cthe dark haired one to whom he had handed the money was there, standing, looking right at him.\u201d Siegel also testified that the other man, the taller man, was \u201cslouching on the fender of the [stopped] car.\u201d It was only after he arrived at the Garrison Police Station that the officers took a report from him concerning his identification. He made an in-court identification of the appellant Foster, sans moustache. He could not positively identify the appellant Forster, by his features, but in height stated that he was similar to the assailant who held the gun on him.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">After Siegel had testified, counsel for the appellants moved to strike his testimony as to the in-court identification \u201cunder the case of <em>Stovall v. Denno\u201d </em>and the motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">Although Cpl. Litchfield testified that at the confrontation scene Siegel stated that the clothing worn by Foster fit the clothing worn by the subject who held him up, and that the physical features of the subjects were the same, he did not there make a positive identification, Officer Nash testified that Siegel stated at the scene that Foster definitely looked like the man to whom he had handed the money and, from the physical build of Foster, he was the one who had held the gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">After the appellants were placed under arrest a search of the trunk of the vehicle with the consent of the owner-passenger revealed a .12 gauge shotgun and a box of shotgun shells.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">From their convictions of robbery with a dangerous and deadly weapon following a non-jury trial in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County (Raine, J.) and the sentences imposed thereon, each appellant appealed. In an unreported per curiam, <em>Foster and Forster v. State </em>[No. 188, Sept. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>Term, 1973, decided November 12, 1973], the Court of Special Appeals affirmed their convictions and on the authority of that court\u2019s holdings in <em>Billinger v. State, </em>9 Md. App. 628, 267 A. 2d 275, <em>cert. denied, </em>259 Md. 729 (1970), rejected the contention made that the identification procedure employed by the police was improper. We granted a writ of certiorari limited to the issue of whether the identification procedure followed by the police <em>at </em>the time the appellants were apprehended was proper. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">In <em>Basoff v. State, </em>208 Md. 643, 119 A. 2d 917, (1956), our predecessors established as an evidentiary test for the admissibility of an extra-judicial identification, circumstances \u201cprecluding suspicion of unfairness or unreliability.\u201d <em>See also Johnson v. State, </em>237 Md. 283, 289, 206 A. 2d 138 (1965); <em>Proctor v. State, </em>223 Md. 394, 164 A. 2d 708 (1960); <em>Judy v. State, </em>218 Md. 168, 146 A. 2d 29 (1958). <em>See also </em>Annot., 71 A.L.R.2d 449 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">In 1967 the United States Supreme Court in a trilogy of opinions in <em>United States v. Wade, </em>388 U. S. 218, 87 S. Ct. 1926,18 L.Ed.2d 1149, <em>Gilbert v. California, </em>388 U. S. 263, 87 S. Ct. 1951, 18 L.Ed.2d 1178, and <em>Stovall v. Denno, </em>388 U. S. 293, 87 S. Ct. 1967, 18 L.Ed.2d 1199, brought the test of the admissibility of such extra-judicial identifications within the protection of the sixth and fourteenth amendments to the United States Constitution. In both <em>Wade </em>and <em>Gilbert </em>that Court held that a post-indictment line-up was a \u201ccritical stage\u201d of the proceedings which, when conducted without notice to, or the presence of, counsel was in violation of the defendant\u2019s right to counsel under the sixth amendment. The Court held in <em>Wade </em>that it was error to have admitted an in-court identification without first determining whether such identification was tainted by the illegal line-up procedure, or had an origin independent thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">In <em>Wade </em>Mr. Justice Brennan, who delivered the majority opinion for the Court, wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-8\">\u201cBut the confrontation compelled by the State between the accused and the victim or witnesses to a crime to elicit identification evidence is peculiarly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>riddled with innumerable dangers and variable factors which might seriously, even crucially, derogate from a fair trial. The vagaries of eyewitness identification are well known; the annals of criminal law are rife with instances of mistaken identification.\u201d <em>Id. </em>388 U. S. at 228.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">In reasoning that the respondent\u2019s rights under the sixth amendment were violated, he stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-6\">\u201cSince it appears that there is grave potential for prejudice, intentional or not, in the pretrial lineup, which may not be capable of reconstruction at trial, and since presence of counsel itself can often avert prejudice and assure a meaningful confrontation at trial, there can be little doubt that for Wade the post-indictment lineup was a critical stage of the prosecution at which he was \u2018as much entitled to such aid [of counsel] ... as at the trial itself.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>388 U. S. at 236-37. (Footnote omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">In <em>Gilbert </em>the Court found: \u201cThe admission of the in-court identifications without first determining that they were not tainted by the illegal lineup but were of independent origin was constitutional error. <em>United States v. Wade, supra.\u201d Id. </em>388 U. S. at 272. Again, Mr. Justice Brennan, for the majority, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-9\">\u201cOnly a <em>per se </em>exclusionary rule as to such testimony can be an effective sanction to assure that law enforcement authorities will respect the accused\u2019s constitutional right to the presence of his counsel at the critical lineup. In the absence of legislative regulations adequate to avoid the hazards to a fair trial which inhere in lineups as presently conducted, the desirability of deterring the constitutionally objectionable practice must prevail over the undesirability of excluding relevant evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>388 U. S. at 273.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-10\">In <em>Stovall v. Denno, supra, </em>the Court held that the exclusionary rules promulgated in <em>Wade </em>and <em>Gilbert </em>were to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>have prospective application only, but recognized nonetheless that a confrontation not barred by <em>Wade </em>and <em>Gilbert </em>may be \u201cso unnecessarily suggestive and conducive to irreparable mistaken identification\u201d that he [defendant] was denied due process of law. <em>Id. </em>388 U. S. at 302.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">In <em>Stovall </em>the wife of a physician, who had been stabbed to death, had also been stabbed repeatedly and was hospitalized. The police found evidence at the assault scene which was traced to the petitioner. Upon his arrest the following day his arraignment was postponed to permit the retention of counsel; in the interval the police took him, handcuffed to a police officer, and accompanied by four other police officers and two members of the prosecutor\u2019s staff, to the hospital room where the witness was recuperating. She identified him. It was contended that this confrontation without the assistance of counsel was made under circumstances which \u201cunfairly focused the witness\u2019 attention on [the defendant] as a man believed by the police to be the guilty person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">Concerning the effect of the decisions in <em>Wade </em>and <em>Gilbert, </em>Mr. Justice Brennan, writing for the majority of the Court, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-7\"><em>\u201cWade </em>and <em>Gilbert </em>fashion exclusionary rules to deter law enforcement authorities from exhibiting an accused to witnesses before trial for identification purposes without notice to and in the absence of counsel. A conviction which rests on a mistaken identification is a gross miscarriage of justice. The <em>Wade </em>and <em>Gilbert </em>rules are aimed at minimizing that possibility by preventing the unfairness at the pretrial confrontation that experience has proved can occur and assuring meaningful examination of the identification witness\u2019 testimony at trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>388 U. S. at 297.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">In holding that the confrontation conducted in the hospital room was not \u201cso unnecessarily suggestive and conducive to irreparable mistaken identification\u201d that it constituted a denial of due process of law, he continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>\u201cThe practice of showing suspects singly to persons for the purpose of identification, and not as part of a lineup, has been widely condemned. However, a claimed violation of due process of law in the conduct of a confrontation depends on the totality of the circumstances surrounding it, and the record in the present case reveals that the showing of Stovall to Mrs. Behrendt in an immediate hospital confrontation was imperative.\u201d <em>Id. </em>388 U. S. at 302. (Footnote omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">The Court adopted with approval the observations of the United States Court of Appeals in the case, that Mrs. Behrendt was the only person who could possibly exonerate Stovall, that no one knew how long she might live, that faced with the responsibility of ascertaining the identity of the attacker and the need for immediate action, the police had adopted the only feasible procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">Save and except for circumstances factually similar to those in <em>Stovall </em>it came to be held, that notwithstanding that the holdings of <em>Wade </em>and <em>Gilbert </em>involved post-indictment line-ups, the exclusionary rules announced by <em>Wade </em>and <em>Gilbert </em>were applicable as well to a line-up conducted before indictment and to other pre-trial confrontations. <em>Palmer v. State, </em>5 Md. App. 691, 249 A. 2d 482 (1969). In <em>Palmer </em>Judge Orth (now Chief Judge), for the Court of Special Appeals, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-7\">\u201cWe think it necessarily follows that the rules of <em>Wade </em>and <em>Gilbert </em>apply also to a lineup conducted before indictment and to other pretrial confrontations within the meaning of <em>Tyler.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>We again note that in <em>Stovall, </em>at 300, the Court said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>that <em>Wade </em>and <em>Gilbert </em>affect \u2018 * * * all future cases <em>which involve confrontations for identification purposes </em>conducted in the absence of counsel * * (emphasis supplied). It did not limit their affect to \u2018post-indictment lineups.\u2019 . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>5 Md. App. at 696, 249 A. 2d at 486.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">In <em>Smith v. State, </em>6 Md. App. 59, 250 A. 2d 285, <em>cert. denied, </em>254 Md. 720 (1969), <em>cert. denied, </em>397 U. S. 1057 (1970), Judge Orth again for the Court of Special Appeals, concerning the holdings in <em>Palmer </em>and in <em>Tyler, </em>stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-6\">\u201cWe found that the rules of <em>Wade </em>and <em>Gilbert </em>apply to line-ups, both pre-indictment and post-indictment, and to other pre-trial confrontations \u2018that are not subject to fair and meaningful objective review later at the trial.\u2019 . . . <em>Wade </em>and <em>Gilbert </em>were founded on the constitutional right to counsel and they hold that a confrontation within their meaning was a critical stage of the proceedings. Therefore, absent a waiver of the right, such confrontation without the presence of counsel for the accused was illegal. They then fashioned exclusionary rules of evidence of identification made at an illegal confrontation.....\u201d <em>Id. </em>6 Md. App. at 64-65.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-8\"><em>\u201cWade </em>and <em>Gilbert, </em>therefore, affect the rules previously followed in this State with respect to the admissibility of evidence as to a judicial or extra-judicial identification only as to personal confrontations between the witnesses and the accused declared by those opinions to be illegal in the absence of counsel. It is only then that the exclusionary rules would apply in determining the admissibility of such evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>6 Md. App. at 65,250 A. 2d at 289.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b302-9\">Concerning the effect of the holdings in <em>Stovall, </em>he stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-10\">\u201cBut the Court said that it was a recognized ground of attack upon a conviction, independent of any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>right to counsel claim, that a pre-trial confrontation was \u2018so unnecessarily suggestive and conducive to irreparable mistaken identification\u2019 as to be a denial of due process of law. Such a claimed violation of due process of law depends on the totality of the circumstances surrounding it. Although the Court recognized that the circumstances of a confrontation may result in a denial of due process of law, it found, [in <em>Stovall] </em>on the totality of the circumstances surrounding the confrontation there, that due process had not been denied. It did not enunciate exclusionary rules applicable when there is such a denial, but we think it follows that when a confrontation is illegal, whether by the denial of the constitutional right to counsel or the constitutional right to due process of law, the same exclusionary rules would apply. We hold that when a pre-trial confrontation is found to be illegal by the denial of due process of law, the exclusionary rules, enunciated in <em>Wade </em>and <em>Gilbert, </em>as hereinbefore set out, are applicable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>6 Md. App. at 65-66, 250 A. 2d at 289-90.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">Thereafter, and before the decision of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Kirby v. Illinois, </em>406 U. S. 682, 92 S. Ct. 1877, 32 L.Ed.2d 411 (1972), the holdings in <em>Wade-Gilbert </em>were applied consistently in this State to pre-trial identifications without regard to whether the confrontation was post-indictment or pre-indictment. <em>See Watson v. State, </em>7 Md. App. 225, 255 A. 2d 103 (1969); <em>Simon v. State, </em>7 Md. App. 446, 256 A. 2d 348 (1969), <em>cert. denied, </em>256 Md. 748 (1970); <em>Joyner v. State, </em>7 Md. App. 692, 257 A. 2d 444 (1969), <em>cert. denied, </em>257 Md. 734 (1970); <em>Cook v. State, </em>8 Md. App. 243, 259 A. 2d 326 (1969); <em>McChan v. State, </em>9 Md. App. 317, 264 A. 2d 133, <em>cert. denied, </em>258 Md. 729 (1970); <em>Williams v. State, </em>11 Md. App. 607, 275 A. 2d 522, <em>cert. denied, </em>262 Md. 751 (1971); <em>Vernon v. State, </em>12 Md. App. 430, 278 A. 2d 609, <em>cert. denied, </em>263 Md. 722 (1971); <em>Davis v. State, </em>13 Md. App. 394, 283 A. 2d 432 (1971), <em>cert. denied, </em>264 Md. 746 (1972); <em>Robinson v. State, </em>13 Md. App. 439, 283 A. 2d 637 (1971). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>issue of the applicability of <em>Wade-Gilbert </em>to pre-trial confrontations severely divided the state courts throughout the country; the majority adopting the reasoning of <em>Palmer v. State, supra, </em>and <em>Smith v. State, supra. See </em>406 U. S. at 687 n. 5, 704 n. 14.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">In <em>Kirby v. Illinois, supra,</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the Supreme Court held that the per se exclusionary rules of <em>Wade-Gilbert </em>were to <em>be </em>applied only at or after the time that adversary judicial proceedings had been initiated against a defendant by way of formal charge, preliminary hearing, indictment, information or arraignment. After noting that the rationale of <em>Wade </em>and <em>Gilbert </em>\u201cwas that an accused is entitled to counsel at any \u2018critical stage of the prosecution\u2019, and that a post-indictment line-up was such a \u2018critical stage\u2019 \u201d, Mr. Justice Stewart, for the plurality, said: \u201cWe decline to depart from that rationale today by imposing a <em>per se </em>exclusionary rule upon testimony concerning an identification that took place long before the commencement of any prosecution whatever.\u201d <em>Id. </em>406 U. S. at 690. After pointing out that any pre-trial confrontation which might be made immune to attack as a result of the holdings in <em>Kirby </em>could still be scrutinized to determine whether it was \u201cunnecessarily suggestive and conducive to irreparable mistaken identification\u201d under <em>Stovall, supra, </em>and <em>Foster v. California, </em>394 U. S. 440, 89 S. Ct. 1127, 22 L.Ed.2d 402 (1969),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Mr. Justice Stewart observed that \u201cWhen a person has not been formally charged with a criminal offense, <em>Stovall </em>strikes the appropriate constitutional balance between the right of a suspect to be protected from prejudicial procedures and the interest of society in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>prompt and purposeful investigation of an unsolved crime.\u201d <em>Id. </em>406 U. S. at 691.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">As a result of the decision in <em>Kirby, </em>in <em>Jackson v. State, </em>17 Md. App. 167, 300 A. 2d 430, <em>cert. denied, </em>268 Md. 749 (1973), Chief Judge Orth, for the Court of Special Appeals, after first noting that \u201cafter a lapse of four years we are told that what we so clearly saw in <em>Wade </em>and <em>Gilbert </em>was not really there,\u201d stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-6\">\u201cThe decision of this Court that the holdings of <em>Wade </em>and <em>Gilbert </em>were to be applied to pre-indictment as well as post-indictment confrontations was predicated upon our belief that such application was constitutionally compelled. Now that the Supreme Court [in <em>Kirby v. </em>Illinois] has made clear that our belief was ill founded, we abandon our position.\u201d <em>Id. </em>17 Md. App. at 171-72, 300 A. 2d at 434.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b305-9\">After pointing out what the Court in <em>Kirby </em>said \u201cabout the constitutional right to counsel at pre-trial confrontations was not to suggest that abuse of identification procedures in the course of a criminal investigation were beyond the reach of the federal constitution,\u201d Judge Orth observed that \u201cThis in substance was the firmly established law of Maryland before the <em>Wade-Gilbert-Stovall </em>trilogy.\u201d He further stated for the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-10\">\u201cWe concluded in <em>Smith and Samuels, </em>at 65, that <em>Wade </em>and <em>Gilbert </em>affected the rules previously followed in this State with respect to the admissibility of evidence as to a judicial or extra-judicial identification only as to personal confrontations between the witness and the accused declared by those opinions to be illegal by the absence of counsel. We held that the exclusionary rule of <em>Wade </em>and <em>Gilbert </em>applied to any pretrial confrontation which was in violation of due process of law under <em>Stovall. Id., </em>at 65-66. We do not depart from that holding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>17 Md. App. at 173, 300 A. 2d at 434.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b306-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>The decisions have thus \u201ccome full circle\u201d from the evidentiary test applicable to such pre-trial confrontations as announced in <em>Basoffv. State, supra, </em>except that now the \u201ccircumstances precluding suspicion of unfairness or unreliability\u201d are placed upon constitutional \u201cdue process\u201d grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">Appellants here concede that the holdings in <em>Kirby v. Illinois, supra, </em>as followed in <em>Jackson v. State, supra, </em>are dispositive of any argument that the identification procedure here followed was in violation of their rights under the sixth amendment to have counsel present at the confrontation; they argue, however, that though not invalid for want of counsel, the pre-trial one-on-one identifications were in violation of their \u201cdue process\u201d rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">In <em>Neil v. Biggers, </em>409 U. S. 188, 93 S. Ct. 375, 34 L.Ed.2d 401 (1972), the United States Supreme Court held that although a station-house identification of the respondent may have been \u201csuggestive,\u201d under the totality of the circumstances there was \u201cno substantial likelihood of misidentification\u201d and that the evidence of the pre-trial identification need not have been excluded. Seven months after a rape (and prior to <em>Stovall) </em>the victim identified the respondent at a police station in a one-on-one confrontation.

S., at 384, [19 L.Ed.2d 1247, 88 S.

It is the <em>likelihood of misidentification which violates a defendant\u2019s right to due process, </em>and it is this which was the basis of the exclusion of evidence in <em>Foster. </em>Suggestive confrontations are disapproved because they increase the likelihood of misidentification, and unnecessarily suggestive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>ones are condemned for the further reason that the increased chance of misidentification is gratuitous.

(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-5\">\u201c . .. The purpose of a strict rule barring evidence of unnecessarily suggestive confrontations would be to deter the police from using a less reliable procedure where a more reliable one may be available, not because in every instance the admission of evidence of such a confrontation offends due process. <em>Clemons v.

At the hospital another officer noticed that Billinger answered the description given by the victims and brought this fact to their attention; they there made a positive identification of him. Judge Orth, again writing for the Court of Special Appeals, although recognizing that the <em>broad language </em>in <em>Wade </em>and <em>Gilbert </em>did not limit their applicability to post-indictment confrontations, distinguished the facts in <em>Billinger </em>from the application of the holdings in <em>Wade </em>based upon a \u201cprompt confrontation\u201d \u2014 within minutes after the commission of the crime \u2014 and following the reasoning in <em>Russell v.

In so holding we are not unmindful of the special emphasis which the appellant places on the circumstance that at the time he was identified, he was the sole occupant of a police cruiser and was identified by the victim looking at him through the vehicle\u2019s window. He contends that the victim\u2019s viewing of him under these circumstances was in itself unnecessarily suggestive and conducive to misidentification. We disagree. While a person who is in police custody and is singly exhibited to an eyewitness to the crime undoubtedly creates a suggestive situation, the fact that his police custody involves being placed in a patrol wagon as the sole occupant thereof rather than simply being in the physical presence of a police officer would seem to make little if any difference so far as the extent of the suggestiveness is concerned. In both situations the suspect is alone in police custody and the police are in effect saying to the witness, \u2018We have apprehended this person because we believe he may possibly be the one who committed the crime. Look at him and tell us whether you can identify him as the culprit.\u2019 Furthermore, in <em>Bates v. United States [supra] </em>the Court held that the viewing of a suspect while he was the sole occupant of a patrol wagon did not make the identification a violation of due process under the rationale of <em>Stovall. </em>We likewise conclude that the same circumstance in this case did not make the identification illegal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>13 Md.

The assailant fled when she screamed and was observed by a police officer running from the apartment. Eluding the first policeman, he was apprehended by other officers a short distance away. Placed in a patrol wagon approximately 30 minutes after the reported attack he was driven back to the crime scene; the complainants were asked to come down from their apartment to view the appellant \u2014 the sole occupant of the police wagon.

And we think this is a sound result, which will not invalidate what is, when properly used, a useful identification procedure simply because of the difficulties of applying the relevant rule as stated in <em>Stovall </em>to the facts of a particular case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>486 F. 2d at 52-53.

As support for such a proposition they cite from the language used in <em>Neil v.

United States, supra </em>(405 F. 2d at 1106.)], and \u2018promote[s] fairness\u2019 and enhances \u2018reliability of the identifications\u2019 <em>[United States v. Wilson </em>(435 F. 2d at 404-05.)].\u201d <em>Id. </em>486 F. 2d at 54.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-7\">\u201c . .. While it may be conceded that a line-up is admittedly more reliable than a show-up in most cases, it is not necessarily so in a prompt, quick show-up held under proper circumstances. And this is the basis of the innumerable cases in which prompt confrontations have been found acceptable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>486 F. 2d at 54-55.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b318-8\">Without here deciding whether a line-up is a more or less reliable procedure than a show-up \u2014 in either one the suspect is equally in police custody and generally under restraint and to that extent it might be argued that custody over the suspect is indicative of suggestiveness \u2014 the adoption of such a rule of exclusion would be completely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>contrary to the overwhelming weight of authority and we decline to so hold.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">In <em>United States v. Perry, supra, </em>the Court, after observing that under <em>Russell, supra, </em>the redeeming virtue of identifications made on or near-the-scene is their \u201cfreshness,\u201d promoting both their reliability, and consequently their fairness; and noting that the \u201ctrustworthiness of an eyewitness\u2019 identification, dependent as it is on sharpness of memory, is apt to lessen with the passage of time,\u201d stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-6\">\u201cWe can no more say that every identification within any particular fixed period is assuredly reliable than we can say that every identification beyond that period is assuredly unreliable. We reject, then, a purely artificial time approach to confrontations of the type under review, and favor instead a standard which gives other factors bearing upon the fidelity of the identification their just due.\u201d id. 449 F. 2d at 1032. (Footnote omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">Under the facts in this case we need not establish a rule creating an artificial limit of time within which, after an offense, such confrontation or show-up must be conducted. The \u201clength of time between the crime and the confrontation\u201d \u2014 as one of the elements within the totality of the circumstances prescribed by <em>Neil v. Biggers, supra </em>\u2014 was here minimal. Siegel was brought face to face with the appellants \u201cwithin approximately ten minutes\u201d of the robbery, at a time when, \u201cwithout any translation into words, photographic recall is most often ephemeral,\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Siegel\u2019s direct observation of the physical features and wearing apparel of the bandit to whom he had handed the money from his wallet across the hood of his automobile was fresh and vivid. The proximity of time in these circumstances helped to \u201cinsure accuracy,\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> \u201cpromote[d] fairness\u201d and enhanced \u201cthe reliability of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>identification.\u201d <footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The vehicle in which the appellants were riding was stopped by Officer Hojnowski \u2014 heading away from the scene of the robbery and approximately one block therefrom \u2014 almost immediately after he received a radio broadcast reporting the incident and detailing the description of two white males who were reported in flight, as occurred in <em>United States v. Miller, </em>449 F. 2d 974, 978-79 (D.C. Cir. 1971); in <em>Harris v. Dees, </em>421 F. 2d 1079 (5th Cir. 1970); and in <em>Russell v. United States, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">To constitute an arrest by detention, without a touching, there must be an intent on the part of the one arresting to arrest. <em>Rome v. State, </em>236 Md. 583, 586, 204 A. 2d 674, 676 (1964); <em>Price v. State, </em>227 Md. 28, 33, 175 A. 2d 11, 13 (1961); <em>Cornish v. State, </em>215 Md. 64, 68, 137 A. 2d 170, 172 (1957). When a person is approached by a police officer and merely questioned about his identity and actions this amounts to no more than an \u201caccosting\u201d and does not constitute an arrest. <em>Duffy v. State, </em>243 Md. 425, 431, 221 A. 2d 653, 656 (1966); <em>Shipley v. State, </em>243 Md. 262, 268, 220 A. 2d 585, 588 (1966); <em>Jones v. State, </em>242 Md. 95, 101, 218 A. 2d 7, 10 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">When the police officer stopped the Chevrolet and had the appellant Forster identify himself, the appellants were not under arrest \u2014 even though their freedom of mobility was no doubt restricted \u2014 but only had been \u201caccosted\u201d \u2014 as the trial court ruled. They were not placed in a police vehicle, were not handcuffed, nor were they required to accompany the police back to the scene of the robbery at Siegel\u2019s residence. Rather, as was done in <em>Spencer v. Turner, </em>468 F. 2d 599, 601 (10th Cir. 1972), in <em>Stidham v. Wingo, </em>452 F. 2d 837, 841 (6th Cir. 1971) and in <em>United States v. Miller, supra, </em>the witness Siegel was transported by the police to the scene where the vehicle in which the appellants were riding had been stopped.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">This \u201caccosting\u201d of the appellants by the police was under such circumstances that it additionally \u201cpromoted fairness\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>by allowing their expeditious release as innocent suspects if they were exonerated at the confrontation, without the necessity of them being taken into custody and transported to a police facility for the staging of a line-up. And at the same time, if they had been there exculpated, such procedure would have permitted the police to promptly resume their search for the fleeing culprits while the trail was fresh.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">The appellants also argue, as was urged in <em>United States v. Hines, supra, </em>that the presence of a number of policemen at the confrontation scene and the nervousness of Siegel created conditions of \u201cunnecessary suggestiveness.\u201d In <em>Hines </em>the defendant contended that there were \u201cspecial elements of unfairness\u201d due to the presence of an unusual number of policemen at the time of the identification, because of a mistaken \u201cpoliceman-in-trouble\u201d call, the fact that he was in handcuffs when brought before the witnesses, and because of the nervous state of the witnesses. The Court, concerning the allegation of \u201cnervousness\u201d, stated: \u201c . . . [Something more egregious than nervousness on the part of the eyewitnesses and the presence of handcuffs on the suspect was contemplated when the Court [in <em>Russell v. United States, supra, </em>408 F. 2d at 1284] referred to \u2018special circumstances of unfairness.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>455 F. 2d at 1328.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">Concerning the presence of a number of policemen, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-7\">\u201cThe record is unclear as to how many policemen were present in the office. Estimates ran between two or three to twelve. In any event, all of the eyewitnesses testified at trial that neither the additional police, nor their own nervousness for that matter, impeded their ability to recognize appellant Hines. . ..\u201d <em>Id. </em>455 F. 2d at 1328.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">As in <em>Hines, supra, </em>there is no evidence in this record of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>how many policemen were present (there must have been at least four) since the testimony disclosed only that there were four police cars at or near the scene. Although Siegel admitted that he had been made nervous as a result of the incident, there was no suggestion of hysteria on his part and no evidence that any nervousness \u201cimpeded [his] ability to recognize\u201d Foster. En route to the confrontation scene there was no conversation between him and the police officer concerning the suspects, they conversed about his combat experiences in World War II. and the fact that never previously had he had a gun pointed directly at him.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">Although some suggestiveness is inherent in such a factual situation \u2014 the appellants, standing outside the stopped vehicle in the presence of at least four policemen \u2014 it is not one of undue suggestiveness, \u201cin view of the countervailing considerations that prompt, on-the-scene identifications are likely to promote fairness, by enhancing the reliability of the identifications, and permit expeditious release of innocent subjects.\u201d <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>435 F. 2d 403, 405 (1970), cited with approval in <em>Stanley v. Cox, supra. </em>We find from the environment in which the confrontation of the appellants occurred that it was not \u201cunnecessarily suggestive.\u201d Such conclusion is buttressed by the fact that even though the appellant Forster was there in the presence of at least four policemen, such fact did not induce Siegel to make an improper identification; he could make no identification of Forster other than to state that he was of the same height as the assailant who had pointed the weapon at him. See <em>Stanley v. Cox, supra, id. </em>486 F. 2d at 53.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\"><em>Smith v. Coiner, </em>473 F. 2d 877 (4th Cir. 1973), cited by the appellants, is factually inapposite to this case. The show-up identification there was rejected under the \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d test since the prosecutrix had seen her assailant for \u201conly two seconds\u201d by the light of a flashlight; she had impaired vision, and was not wearing her glasses at the time of the incident and had given, at best, a hazy description of her assailant prior to confronting him five hours after the crime. <em>See Stanley v. Cox, supra, </em>486 F. 2d at 55.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>The facts in <em>Spencer v. Turner, supra, </em>are almost identical with those in this case. A filling station in Salt Lake City had been held-up, the attendant gave a description of the wearing apparel of his assailant. Approximately 35 minutes after the robbery the police arrested Spencer, who answered the description, as he stopped his automobile at an intersection; the filling station attendant was driven to the scene of the confrontation by the police and made a positive identification. A search of the car disclosed a gun box and shells.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">In a per curiam that court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-6\">\u201cIt is significant here that the identification was closely connected with the robbery itself; it was related in both time and space, and while identifications conducted in this manner, that is, by presentation of the accused to the victim, are not favored, there is no apparent reason for holding that the instant confrontation was either unfair or untrustworthy. The incident occurred at a time when it was important to the accused as well as the state to know whether the appellee should be released or held, and thus we cannot conclude that this hot pursuit identification which occurred on the street soon after the incident violated the Constitution or for that matter was unfair.\u201d <em>Id. </em>468 F. 2d at 601.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">All the factors prescribed by <em>Neil v. Biggers, supra, </em>to be considered within the \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d in making an appraisal as to whether or not the confrontation \u201cwas so unnecessarily suggestive as to give rise to a very substantial likelihood of misidentification\u201d were gratified; there was a minimum \u201clength of time between the crime and the confrontation\u201d; Siegel\u2019s vision in the illumination from the outside post-lights on his property and from his position across the hood of his automobile, as he first handed over his wallet and then the money, gave him a sufficiently clear and extended opportunity \u201cto view the criminal at the time of the crime\u201d; the \u201caccuracy of [his] prior description of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>criminal\u201d was supplied by the graphic description he gave the police, both over the telephone and to the first arriving officer, and was confirmed by his in-court testimony; his \u201cdegree of attention,\u201d as well as the \u201clevel of the certainty demonstrated by [him] at the confrontation\u201d were equally established by his cogent, uncompromised testimony.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">From our independent examination and appraisal of all the facts, circumstances and environment in connection with the identification procedure followed by the police at the time the witness confronted the appellants we hold that such show-up was not \u201cso unnecessarily suggestive as to give rise to a very substantial likelihood of misidentification,\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> making the evidence concerning the out of court identification properly admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">\n<em>Judgment of the Court of Special Appeals affirmed; costs to be paid by appellants.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b301-8\">.
