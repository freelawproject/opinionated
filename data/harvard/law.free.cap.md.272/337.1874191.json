Ca\u00f1aras (Ca\u00f1aras), a Maryland attorney in the full-time employ of the Social Security Administration, brought suit in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County against Lift Truck Services, Inc. (Lift Truck) for breach of a contract of employment whereunder he was to render to Lift Truck services \u201cas a member of its board of directors, as a consultant to the general manager and as an arbitrator\u201d, as well as other part-time professional services and advice. Disappointed that the trial court (Raine, J.), following a non-jury trial, entered a judgment in his favor, for $2,200.00 instead of the $41,448.84 <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> he claimed, Ca\u00f1aras asks us to reverse. We decline to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>Beginning in about 1965, when Ca\u00f1aras prepared the incorporation documents, he had from time to time performed part-time legal services for Lift Truck, had \u201coffered business guidance\u201d, participated in meetings, assisted in obtaining a franchise, drafted agreements, had discussed a pension plan, handled some collection matters, and had, in at least one tort litigation, engaged as co-counsel with insurance counsel. For such services he was paid on a per hour basis, except in collection cases where his compensation was a percentage of the recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">Lift Truck is a small closely held corporation specializing, as its name connotes, in the servicing and repair of material-handling vehicles. The principals, Messrs. Kenneth M. Gent, president, Frank J. Szumlanski, vice president, and William K. Hufham, Sr., secretary-treasurer, were not only its stockholders, but constituted as well the board of directors. Each possessed mechanical and technical expertise, but was generally unskilled in business management. In mid-1971, wishing to devote themselves exclusively to the technical aspects of the operation, they discussed the employment of a general manager to run its day to day business operations. The principals had decided upon Leroy W. Applegate, then the sales manager of Lift Truck, to be promoted to general manager.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Ca\u00f1aras testified that such discussions also involved his retention as a consultant to such a general manager and as an arbiter of any potential rifts between the general manager and the principals of Lift Truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">On his own initiative, at a meeting held on December 1, 1971, Ca\u00f1aras submitted to the principals two proposed contracts of employment \u2014 each pre-dated December 1, 1971 \u2014 one formalizing the employment of Applegate as general manager and the other proposing his employment. Ca\u00f1aras\u2019 contract basically proposed that he be employed on a one year basis, from December 1, 1971 to December 1, 1972, at a net salary of $200.00 per month, for services not to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>exceed eight hours per month. Included in the proffered agreement was a provision for its renewal, as set forth in Paragraph Ninth, which has here become the principal source of contention. That paragraph reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-3\">\u201cNinth: The Employer shall have the option to renew this agreement and to extend Employee\u2019s employment upon the same terms and provisions as are contained herein for one additional period of Five years (5) years; such renewal shall take effect automatically unless the Employer shall give to the Employee written notice of its election not to renew this contract at least nine full months prior to November 1, 1972. This contract shall then automatically be renewed for another additional five year period unless the Employee shall notify the Employer of his election not to renew this contract, such notice to be given nine months prior to November 1, 1977.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">Ca\u00f1aras submitted at the same time, similarly pre-dated as December 1, 1971, proposed minutes of a board of directors meeting and of a special meeting of the stockholders \u2014 (not yet held) \u2014 undertaking to record the execution of a contract with a management consultant (himself) and the execution of a contract with a general manager, as well as his election to the board of directors.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">The evidence is uncontradicted that at that meeting on December 1, 1971, the proposed contracts were submitted, read and discussed, but the officers and directors refused to accept the contract for Ca\u00f1aras\u2019 employment. Hufham stated that he \u201cwanted to consult his attorney\u201d to have him inspect the Ganaras proposal, and his attorney advised against execution of the contract; Szumlanski was \u201cconcerned about the cost\u201d, the \u201cfinancial burden\u201d to be assumed by Lift Truck under such a contract. The officers and directors at that meeting advised Ca\u00f1aras that the documents were not acceptable and they would not sign them. Not to be thwarted, however, by such lack of enthusiasm on the part of the principals for his employment, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>Ca\u00f1aras \u2014 apparently by his persistence \u2014 resubmitted the contract proposals at meetings of the board held on December 9, 1971, April 12, and May 4, 1972, at each of which, after similar discussions, the board equally rejected their execution. Within the interval David Monoker, the accountant for Lift Truck, who was also an attorney, reviewed the Ca\u00f1aras proposal and similarly advised the board not to execute it.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">At a meeting of the stockholders and of the board on May 18, 1972, each of the principals was present as were Applegate, Monoker and Ca\u00f1aras. At that meeting Applegate\u2019s contract as general manager was executed even though he had been serving in that capacity since December 1971. He testified that he never requested such a contract, did not believe that he needed a written contract of employment, that the subject matter had been initiated by Ca\u00f1aras and that he had executed the contract \u201cat the request of the directors.\u201d While Applegate\u2019s contract was being discussed Ca\u00f1aras requested that he leave the meeting; Monoker left as well. The Ca\u00f1aras contract which had been drafted on his initiative and which was originally presented by him at the meeting of December 1,1971 \u2014 and had been regularly thereafter rejected \u2014 came to be executed. The evidence was undisputed that no signing of either of the contracts, nor of the minutes \u2014 although dated December 1,1971 \u2014 occurred until May 18,1972.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">Messrs. Gent, Szumlanski and Hufham \u2014 all called as witnesses by Ca\u00f1aras \u2014 each testified that they had no intention of executing Ca\u00f1aras\u2019 employment contract, had no recollection of having so executed it, intended only to execute Applegate\u2019s contract and the minutes of the meeting; that all the papers had been submitted together and could only explain the execution of the Ca\u00f1aras contract by concluding that it was \u201cpart of the bunch of papers\u201d submitted to them for signature by Ca\u00f1aras whom they trusted as their attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">Notwithstanding these protestations, Gent, the president, acknowledged the authenticity of his signature on the Ca\u00f1aras contract, as did Hufham, a witness to both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>signatures; all identified their signatures to the stockholders\u2019 minutes and Hufham acknowledged the genuineness of his signature to the minutes of the board of directors meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">At lunch time, on June 13,1972, Ca\u00f1aras visited the office of Lift Truck; he advised the bookkeeper-office manager that he was then \u201con the pay roll\u201d \u2014 although she had received no information from anyone placing him in that status \u2014 and he directed that she prepare a check for him in the net amount of $200.00.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The check was hand carried to Gent and Hufham who were at work in the service area of the shop and was jointly signed by them. When the matter was discussed that very afternoon with the principals she was instructed by Applegate to transfer the Ca\u00f1aras payment from the pay roll account and record it as \u201cpayment for legal services.\u201d On July 6, 1972, Ca\u00f1aras had turned over a check from a collection matter and simultaneously had received his $170.00 percentage fee for such work. After several unsuccessful attempts to locate Ca\u00f1aras he was advised by Monoker, on or about August 1, 1972, that his services were no longer required; his request for a salary check for July was not honored and he was formally thereafter requested to return all books and records.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">The trial court, although finding that there was a confidential attorney-client relationship between Ca\u00f1aras and Lift Truck, found no evidence of fraud. The court further found that the principals, whom he described as \u201chigh grade mechanics\u201d and who impressed him as being \u201cextraordinarily obtuse\u201d, could not be allowed to repudiate the execution of the Ca\u00f1aras contract by merely stating \u201cWe don\u2019t remember signing it, and as far as we are concerned, we didn\u2019t sign it.\u201d Having found in fact that the contract was executed on May 18, 1972, the court concluded that \u201cat the time it was signed the automatic renewal provision contained in Paragraph Ninth was completely nugatory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>since it could not, under any circumstances, be complied with.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">Although Ca\u00f1aras claimed damages for an 11 year interval by concluding that the contract twice renewed itself for two'additional five-year periods since Lift Truck \u201cdid not give him written notice of its election not to renew [the] contract at least nine full months prior to November 1, 1972,\u201d he was awarded damages at $2,200.00 (for 11 months) for the breach of a one-year contract beginning May 18, 1972.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">The appellant here argues that the trial court impermissibly rewrote his employment contract by holding that Paragraph Ninth was \u201cnugatory\u201d, that by the execution of the contract on May 18, 1972, Lift Truck thereby waived the provision providing it the option not to renew the contract. As a subordinate argument he contends that the denial by the principals of Lift Truck of the execution of his contract constitutes a waiver of the right to rely upon the findings that Paragraph Ninth was \u201cnugatory.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">In <em>Merit Music Service, Inc. v. Sonneborn, </em>245 Md. 213, 225 A. 2d 470 (1967), where one of the appellees had identified her signature to a contract and admitted it to be her signature, and her husband, though not \u201cso sure,\u201d \u201cbelieved it to be his signature,\u201d Judge Finan quoted with approval the language of Chief Judge Sobeloff, speaking for the Court, in <em>Rossi v. Douglas, </em>203 Md. 190, 199, 100 A. 2d 3, 7 (1953), as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-8\">\u201c \u2018There is no claim here of fraud or duress or mutual mistake, and it is well established that in the absence of these features one having the capacity to understand a written document who reads it, or, without reading it or having it read to him, signs it, is bound by his signature. <em>Spitze v. B. &amp; O. R.R., </em>75 Md. 162, 23 A. 307; <em>Columbia Paper Bag Co. v. Carr, </em>116 Md. 541, 82 A. 442; <em>McGrath v. Peterson, </em>127 Md. 412, 96 A. 551; <em>Western Maryland Dairy v.

Eurice, </em>supra; <footnotemark>[4]</footnotemark> <em>Williston, Contracts, </em>sec. 90 A; <em>Restatement of Contracts, </em>sec. 70. Indeed Williston says that even if an illiterate executes a deed under a mistake as to its contents, he is bound both at law and in equity if he did not require it to be read to him or its object explained. This is everywhere the rule. <em>Williston, Contracts, </em>sec. 1577.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>245 Md. at 220, 225 A. 2d at 474.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">Judge Finan continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-6\">\u201cThere is a qualification to the above mentioned rule which this Court recognized in <em>Binder v. Benson, </em>225 Md. 456, 171 A. 2d 248 (1961). Judge Hammond (present Chief Judge), speaking for the Court, said (p. 461, 171 A. 2d 250):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-7\">\u2018A qualification of the rule is that an apparent manifestation of assent will not operate to make a contract if the other party knows, or as a reasonable person should know, that the apparent acceptor does not intend what his words or other acts ostensibly indicate.

Benson, </em>225 Md. 456, 461, 171 A. 2d 248, 250 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">Since the trial court found no fraud in the relationship between Ca\u00f1aras and Lift Truck \u2014 nor was any duress or mutual mistake found \u2014 the holdings in <em>Rossi v. Douglas, supra, </em>and <em>Binder v. Benson, supra, </em>are particularly appropriate in compelling the conclusion that Lift Truck became bound under the contract with Ca\u00f1aras by the signature of its president.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">Concerning the formation of a contract, our predecessors, more than 50 years ago in <em>Buffalo Pressed Steel Co. v. Kirwan, </em>138 Md. 60, 113 A. 628 (1921), stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-8\">\u201cA contract has been defined as an \u2018agreement which creates an obligation,\u2019 13 <em>C.J. </em>237, and such an agreement may be defined as the concurrence of two or more, persons in a common intent to affect their legal relations, and for the purposes of this case these definitions may be taken as sufficiently accurate. The agreement referred to must rest finally upon an offer made by one party and the acceptance thereof by the other party to that contract. <em>Brantly, Contracts, </em>par. 7. An \u2018offer is a proposal to enter into a contract\u2019 (13 <em>C.J. </em>266, also <em>Bouvier), </em>and an acceptance is the assent of the party to whom the offer is addressed to its terms. The offer must be certain and definite and the acceptance must \u2018in every respect meet and correspond with the offer.\u2019 13 <em>C.J. </em>278; <em>Brantly, Contracts, </em>par. 9. That is to say both parties to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>contract \u2018must actually give their assent to that proposal and acceptance, be it what it may, which <em>de facto </em>arise out of the terms of their communications.\u2019 1 <em>Elliott, Contracts, </em>par. 26.\u201d <em>Id. </em>138 Md. at 64, 113 A. at 630.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b367-6\"><em>See also Post v. Gillespie, </em>219 Md. 378, 384, 149 A. 2d 391, 395 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">In <em>Eastover Stores, Inc. v. Minnix, </em>219 Md. 658, 150 A. 2d 884 (1959), a construction contract between the parties provided that the work \u201cshall be commenced immediately and shall be substantially completed in 330 days.\u201d A dispute arose in the trial as to whether the date named in the written agreement, August 29, 1956, or the date on which the contract was executed by the appellees, September 19, 1956, should prevail in computing the starting date for the 330-day period. In holding that the chancellor had properly admitted parol evidence to show that the contract, although dated earlier, was not in fact executed until the latter date, Judge Prescott (later Chief Judge) for the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-8\">\u201cIt is universally held that a manifestation of mutual assent is an essential prerequisite to the creation or formation of a contract. It is likewise universally agreed that it is possible for parties to enter into a binding informal or oral agreement to execute a written contract; and, if the parties contemplate that an agreement between them shall be reduced to writing before it shall become binding and complete, there is no contract until the writing is signed. And the intention of the parties in this respect must be determined by the facts and circumstances in each particular case. <em>Peoples Drug Stores v. Fenton, </em>191 Md. 489, 493, 62 A. 2d 273; <em>Power Service Corporation v. Joslin, </em>175 F. 2d 698, 702, 703 (9th Cir., 1949); 1 <em>Williston, Contracts </em>(Rev.Ed.), Sec. 28. It is likewise, just as broadly and consistently held that parol evidence is inadmissible to vary, alter or contradict a writing which is complete and unambiguous, where no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>fraud, accident or mistake is claimed, <em>Glass v. Doctors Hospital, Inc., </em>213 Md. 44, 57, 131 A. 2d 254; but where doubt arises as to the true sense and meaning of the words themselves or <em>difficulty as to their application under the surrounding circumstances, </em>the sense and meaning of the language may <em>be </em>investigated and determined by evidence <em>dehors </em>the instrument. <em>Vary v. Parkwood Homes, Inc., </em>199 Md. 411, 418, 86 A. 2d 727; <em>Rinaudo v. Bloom, </em>209 Md. 1, 11, 120 A. 2d 184.\u201d <em>Id. </em>219 Md. at 665-66, 150 A. 2d at 888.

Camden Iron Works, </em>181 U. S. 453, 21 S. Ct. 680, 45 L. Ed. 948 (1901).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">This principle of law concerning parol evidence, as set forth in <em>Eastover Stores, Inc. v. Minnix, supra, </em>has been restated in <em>Pumphrey v. Kehoe, </em>261 Md. 496, 504, 276 A. 2d 194, 199 (1971); <em>Foreman v. Melrod, </em>257 Md. 435, 441-42, 263 A. 2d 559, 562-63 (1970); <em>Davidson v. Katz, </em>254 Md. 69, 76-77, 255 A. 2d 49, 52-53 (1969); <em>Rice v.

That evidence was undisputed that notwithstanding that the document had been pre-dated December 1,1971, by Ca\u00f1aras, it did not in fact come to be signed until May 18,1972. It was only on that latter date that Ca\u00f1aras\u2019 repeatedly submitted offer became accepted by Lift Truck by the signature of Gent, its president. The evidence <em>dehors </em>the instrument was properly admissible in ascertaining the effective date of the contract. As the trial court properly found, no contract arose until May 18, 1972, that was the time when the last act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>necessary for its formation occurred. <em>See Chesapeake &amp; Potomac Tel. Co. of Md. v. Allegheny Construction Co., </em>340 F. Supp. 734 (D. Md. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">Parties to a contract may execute an agreement on one date and provide that all the rights, obligations and liabilities thereto will attach respectively as of a retroactive date. Such agreements have been held to be neither void nor objectionable. <em>See Thornton Bros. Inc. v. Gore, </em>252 Miss. 27, 172 So. 2d 425 (1965); <em>Wright v. Prudential Ins. Co., </em>27 Cal. App. 2d 195, 80 P. 2d 752 (1938); and 17 C.J.S. <em>Contracts </em>\u00a7 61 (1963). The parties may similarly provide at the time of its execution that the contract is entered into \u201cas of\u201d an earlier date than that on which it was in fact executed; such agreements are then effective retroactively as to the earlier date and the parties are bound accordingly. See <em>Brewer v. National Surety Corp., </em>169 F. 2d 926, 928 (10th Cir. 1948); <em>American Credit Indem. Co. v. Hecht, </em>137 Ky. 261, 125 S. W. 697, <em>petition for rehearing overruled, </em>129 S. W. 340 (1910); <em>Matthews v. Jeremiah Burns, Inc., </em>205 Misc. 1006, 129 N.Y.S.2d 841 (Sup. Ct., N. Y. Co. 1954); 17 Am. Jur. 2d <em>Contracts </em>\u00a7 69 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">There was no evidence offered that at the time the contract was signed the parties agreed that it was being executed \u201cas of\u201d December 1, 1971, nor any evidence of an intention that the rights, obligations and liabilities spelled out therein were to have retroactive effect. Ca\u00f1aras testified that he had told the principals that \u201cif we did not use the December 1st date that all the dates in the contracts would have to be changed to reflect the May 18th date, but that if we signed the contracts with December 1st dates in them that the contracts would be in effect <em>immediately </em>without any provisions for curtailing the length of the contracts.\u201d Such self-serving declaration was not supported by the testimony of any of the principals whom he called as his witnesses and standing alone \u2014 although the dates were not changed \u2014 falls far short of establishing by probative evidence that the contract was intended to be retroactive to December 1, 1971.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Indeed Ca\u00f1aras\u2019 request for one month\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>salary on June 13, 1972, is inconsistent with any contention of retroactivity.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">It is, of course, as the appellant contends, under <em>Hankins v. Public Service Mut. Ins. Co., </em>192 Md. 68, 84, 63 A. 2d 606, 613 (1949), improper for the court to rewrite the terms of a contract, or draw a new contract for the parties, when the terms thereof are clear and unambiguous, simply to avoid hardships. <em>See also Compania de Astral, S.

Raven Realty, Inc., </em>215 Md. 467, 471-73, 138 A. 2d 898, 900 (1958), the buyer of a tract of land at a sale price of $700.00 brought suit for specific performance; $100.00 had been paid at the time of the execution of the contract on December 16, 1955, the balance was payable within 30 days. The contract provided that \u201ctime was of the essence\u201d and that failure to comply would constitute a forfeiture of the deposit. The buyer claimed that on January 10, 1956, the seller orally granted the buyer an extension of 60 days from January 16, 1956, within which to pay the balance of the purchase money. Although the evidence showed that the buyer was ready, willing and able to consummate the sale on March 7, 1956, there was no evidence as to whether the buyer could have performed the contract on January 16, 1956 \u2014 within the 30 day period originally specified in the contract. The court, in denying specific performance, held that the burden was upon the plaintiff-buyer to establish not only the waiver but the reliance upon it and that it could have performed the contract within the original time limit. Judge Horney, writing for the Court in connection with the terms \u201cwaiver\u201d and \u201cestoppel\u201d, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-6\">\u201cThere is even confusion in the use of the terms \u201cwaiver\u201d and \u201cestoppel\u201d. Many law writers and courts make no effort to distinguish them and use the terms interchangeably. A clarification may not be amiss. When a seller has promised to convey land on the express condition that payment of the purchase price must be made on or before a specified date, payment on time is the condition which a buyer must perform. But, if the seller merely states to the buyer that he does not insist on timely payment, he thereby eliminates the condition, and such statement constitutes a \u201cwaiver\u201d. (Footnote omitted) Being the seller\u2019s voluntary action, it is not necessary for the buyer to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>give any consideration for the waiver, or that the buyer change his position, in reliance thereon, in order for the waiver to be legally effective. If, however, the seller foresees or should have foreseen that the buyer would materially change his position in reliance on the waiver, and the buyer does so, then the seller is \u201cestopped\u201d. The seller\u2019s action is still a \u201cwaiver\u201d, but the resulting action in reliance thereon by the buyer creates the \u201cestoppel\u201d. Thus, \u201cwaiver\u201d consists of the voluntary action of the seller alone, while an \u201cestoppel\u201d requires the action of both the seller and the buyer.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (3. For an exposition of the difference between a \u201cwaiver\u201d and an \u201cestoppel\u201d, see 3 <em>Corbin, Contracts, </em>Sec. 752; <em>Colbath v. H. B.

Wherever the promisee has allowed a legal excuse to arise, relying upon express or implied statements of the promisor that the latter would not avail himself of the excuse, there is waiver. This is a principle distinct from the ordinary equitable estoppel, since the representation is promissory, not a misstatement of an existing fact. * * * To bring the case within the reason of the rule it is essential that the promisee could and would have performed the condition, or would not have allowed the defense to arise, had it not been for the promisor\u2019s waiver. For if the promisee could not have entitled himself to performance of the promise, even had there been no waiver, there is no equitable reason <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>why the promisor should not take advantage of the breach of condition or other defense.

Gardens of Faith, Inc., </em>226 Md. 215, 172 A. 2d 529 (1961) (the keeping of the contract in existence and the acceptance of performance under it after a known breach constituted a waiver of the breach); <em>Nichols v. Nicholas, </em>217 Md. 79, 141 A. 2d 746 (1958) (the acceptance of payment after the expiration of the date fixed for payment constituted a waiver of the time provision for payment); <em>Lissau v. Smith, </em>215 Md. 538, 138 A. 2d 381 (1958) (expression of intention by vendor, before time of performance, not to insist on timely or exact performance constituted waiver of the provisions in the contract as to time).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">The burden was upon Ca\u00f1aras not only to establish a waiver but also that he relied upon it. <em>Evelyn v. Raven Realty, Inc. supra. </em>There was no evidence offered that at the time the contract came to be executed \u2014 or thereafter \u2014 the principals of Lift Truck made any statements to Ca\u00f1aras, nor is there any evidence of any conduct on their part from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>which it could be said that there was an intentional relinquishment of the rights under Paragraph Ninth \u2014 any more than there was evidence that by the execution of the contract it was intended that it be made retroactive to December 1, 1971. At that time there was no right in Lift Truck concerning the renewal option since by virtue of impossibility the right was nonexistent. There was equally no evidence on the part of Ca\u00f1aras of any reliance upon the appellees\u2019 conduct or any change in his position to his detriment that could be said to result in an \u201cestoppel.\u201d <em>Chertkof v. Philadelphia B. &amp; W. R.R., </em>254 Md. 557, 255 A. 2d 14 (1969); <em>Savonis v. Burke, </em>241 Md. 316, 216 A. 2d 521 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">As his final thrust Ca\u00f1aras contends that Lift Truck, having denied the existence of any agreement in the trial court constitutes a waiver on its part that the contract was limited to a term of one year, effective May 18,1972. He cites <em>Foard v. Snider, </em>205 Md. 435, 448, 109 A. 2d 101, 107 (1954), as authority for this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">It is true that in <em>Foard v. Snider, supra, </em>Judge Hammond, for the Court, stated: \u201cIt has been repeatedly held that a denial of liability on one ground may be the waiver of the right to rely on another.\u201d 205 Md. at 448, 109 A. 2d at 107. This statement was repeated in <em>National School Studios, Inc. v. Mealey, </em>211 Md. 116, 128-29, 126 A. 2d 588, 594-95 (1956). Both cases are factually distinguishable. In <em>Foard v. Snider, supra, </em>action had been brought for a declaratory decree to determine whether a deed and bill of sale constituted absolute conveyances of the property described therein or whether the instruments were given merely to secure a debt and for a determination as to whether or not such an agreement was enforceable. In their answer in the declaratory proceedings the appellees declared of record that they had ignored the option provision because of their belief that they possessed a fee simple title to the property and that the option was unenforceable. On appeal it was held that the sellers were not permitted to deny liability by arguing that the option had expired before it was properly exercised \u2014 a position which was inconsistent with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>defense they had pleaded and asserted at the trial. Similarly, in <em>National School Studios, Inc. v. Mealey, supra, </em>an injunction was sought for the specific performance of a covenant in a contract by the appellee who had been a salesman of school children\u2019s photographs. Mealey, in his answer under oath, gave as his reasons for terminating the contract that National had breached the conditions of his employment and he had been thereby forced to terminate his contract. His answer under oath was held to foreclose and to have been a waiver by Mealey of the defenses he undertook to assert since he had continued to consider the contract as orally modified to have been in full force and effect up until the time he cancelled it without notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">Lift Truck has not in this Court presented inconsistent defenses, it concedes the existence of a one-year enforceable contract effective May 18,1972.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">It was Ca\u00f1aras who called Gent, Szumlanski and Hufham \u2014 as his witnesses \u2014 and elicited from them that they had no intention of executing his employment contract and no recollection of having executed it. The issue as to whether or not Paragraph Ninth was intended by the parties to be an enforceable provision in the agreement was raised by the appellee\u2019s general issue plea and was submitted before the trial court by testimony elicited by Ca\u00f1aras. That evidence did not constitute a waiver on the part of Lift Truck to rely in this Court on the conclusions reached in the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">Our review of the case upon both the law and the evidence convinces us that there was substantial evidence to support the trial court\u2019s findings and its conclusions of law and that the judgment must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed; costs to be paid by the appellant.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b359-15\">. An affidavit attached to his unsuccessful motion for summary judgment alleged total net wages for an 11-year period ending November 30, 1982, of $37,880.76, plus an \u201cestimated ten percent ($3,788.08)\u201d withheld income and Social Security taxes, for a total of $41,668.84 \u2014 less a credit for $220.00 for one month\u2019s payment and the \u201cpay roll taxes\u201d thereon of $20.00.
