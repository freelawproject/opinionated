The events leading up to the dispute were stipulated in the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-17\">On February 25, 1971, the plaintiff-appellee Paul J. Duelos, a real estate broker, entered into a sales contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>with David Peebles, Jr., personal representative of the estate of David Peebles, for the purchase of an apartment house. Under this contract, Duelos was both the buyer and broker, and was to be paid a 5% commission by Peebles. A short time thereafter, Duelos interested a third party in the property, defendant-appellant Ronald J. Cohen, who agreed to buy the property directly from Peebles under a new contract, with Duelos acting as broker. To implement this arrangement Duelos and Peebles, on March 25,1971, entered into an agreement terminating their sales contract, and on the same day Peebles and Cohen executed a contract of sale for the real estate.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">The Peebles-Cohen contract provided for settlement \u201cno later than June 15, 1971.\u201d It also contained the following provisions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-6\">\u201cRECEIVED FROM Ronald J. Cohen or his assigns a deposit of FIVE THOUSAND and no/100 \u2014 ($5,000.00) to be applied as part payment . .. upon the following terms of sale:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-7\">\u201cThe property is sold free of encumbrance except as aforesaid; title is to be good of record and in fact. . .; otherwise said deposit is to be returned and sale declared off at the option of the purchaser .... In case legal steps are necessary to perfect the title, such action must be taken by the seller promptly at his own expense, whereupon the time herein specified for full settlement by the purchaser will thereby be extended for the period necessary for such prompt action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-8\">\u201cIn the event of the forfeiture of the deposit, the seller shall allow the agent one-half thereof as a compensation for his services to him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b63-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>Duelos was a signatory to this agreement and was to receive his commission, $20,900.00, from Cohen \u201cby the execution of a Second Deed of Trust secured on subject property . . . [s]aid note to be for two (2) years, payable interest only at 8% . . . The sales agreement provided, in the alternative, that Peebles would be responsible for the brokerage commission if the title proved defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">On several occasions prior to the scheduled settlement date of June 15, 1971, Cohen was informed by the title company that it would not insure that the property was free of encumbrances or that the title was good of record. On May 18, 1971, a federal tax lien of $992,000.00 was placed on the property. On June 15 Cohen appeared at the office of the title company to make settlement as agreed but was then informed that Peebles still could not convey good title because of the federal tax lien. Neither Peebles nor Duclos appeared at the scheduled settlement, and after waiting one hour Cohen departed. On October 5, 1971, almost four months after the scheduled settlement date, Cohen notified the title company that he was rescinding the contract, and pursuant to Cohen\u2019s request the title company returned to him the $5,000.00 deposit.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">The next day, October 6, 1971, Peebles advised Cohen by letter that he was \u201cnow in a position to go to settlement\u201d and that the requirements of the title company for the passage of good title had been met. Peebles requested that a settlement be arranged within thirty days. Whether or not Cohen replied to this letter is not set forth in the record. In any event, settlement between Peebles and Cohen did not take place, and Duclos demanded payment of his commission from both Peebles and Cohen, respectively, under the terms of the March 25, 1971 agreement. Neither party paid a commission to Duclos. Undaunted, the appellee broker arranged a sale of the Peebles property to an unrelated third party (the Jelniker family) on the same terms as the Peebles-Cohen contract. At settlement of the Jelniker contract, on December 31, 1971, Duclos received a commission of $20,900.00. Two months later Duclos again demanded payment from Cohen of a $20,900.00 commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>Duelos then instituted suit in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County against Cohen and Meisel to recover the claimed commission. The trial court (Rutledge, J.), deciding the case upon an agreed statement of facts, concluded that Duelos was entitled to a commission under the provisions of Maryland Code (1957, 1973 Repl. Vol.), Art. 21, \u00a7 14-105. That statute provides (emphasis supplied):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-5\">\u201cWhenever, <em>in the absence of special agreement to the contrary, </em>a real estate broker employed to sell, buy, lease or otherwise negotiate real or leasehold estates or mortgages, or loans thereon, procures in good faith a purchaser, seller, lessor or lessee, mortgagor or mortgagee, borrower or lender, as the case may be, and the person so procured is accepted as such by the employer, and enters into a <em>valid, binding and enforceable </em>written contract of sale, purchase, lease, mortgage, loan or other contract, as the case may be, in terms acceptable to the employer, and such contract is accepted by the employer and signed by him, the broker shall be deemed to have earned the customary or agreed commission, as the case may be, whether or not the contract entered into be actually performed, unless the performance of such contract be prevented, hindered or delayed by any act of the broker.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">Appellants argued in the trial court, and on appeal, that the facts reveal \u201ca special agreement to the contrary\u201d making Art. 21, \u00a7 14-105 inapplicable in the instant case. Appellants urge that under the \u201cspecial agreement\u201d the broker\u2019s entitlement to a commission from the purchasers was conditioned upon settlement taking place. We agree and accordingly reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">By the terms of the contract of sale, which was also the commission agreement as it was signed by the broker, the buyers were to pay Duelos his commission by giving him a note secured by a second deed of trust on the subject property. Of course the purchasers could only use the realty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>as security for the note if they became the owners of the property. Consequently, Duelos must have anticipated that he would get his commission from the purchasers only in the event of actual settlement and passage of title to the purchasers. The agreement also provided for the seller Peebles to pay the brokerage commission if the title proved defective. The import of such a provision buttresses the conclusion that Cohen and Meisel would only be liable for the commission if the sale were consummated. Finally, the sales agreement provided that if the purchasers defaulted and the deposit were therefore forfeited, the broker would receive one-half of the deposit \u201cas a compensation for his services.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">Taking these provisions as a whole, it seems clear that the parties intended the purchasers to pay the broker\u2019s full commission only upon consummation of the sale. If the sale were not consummated because of the seller\u2019s default in not being able to convey good title, then the seller would be liable for the commission. If the sale were not consummated because of the purchasers\u2019 default, the broker was to receive one-half of the forfeited $5,000.00 deposit. What was said by our predecessors in <em>Chasanow v. Willcox, </em>220 Md. 171, 176, 151 A. 2d 748 (1959), concerning similar \u201csubstitutional provisions,\u201d is quite apposite here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-6\">\u201cBut the statute [Art. 21, \u00a7 14-105] is applicable only \u2018in the absence of a special agreement to the contrary,\u2019 and, in this case, there were two special agreements, one of which was a substitute for the other. There was an agreement that the seller would pay the broker a commission to <em>be deducted from the proceeds of sale. </em>However, in the event the purchaser should default it was understood that the seller would allow the broker <em>one-half of the deposit </em>as compensation for his services to the seller. Since these are substitutional provisions, affecting the time of payment, source and amount of the compensation to which the broker would be entitled, the statute has no bearing on a decision of this case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b66-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number><em>See also W. C. Pinkard </em>&amp; <em>Co. v. Castlewood Realty Co., </em>271 Md. 598, 319 A. 2d 123 (1974); <em>Snider Bros. v. Heft, </em>271 Md. 409, 416, 317 A. 2d 848 (1974); <em>Prince George\u2019s Club v. Carr, </em>235 Md. 591, 603, 202 A. 2d 354 (1964); <em>Goss v. Hill, </em>219 Md. 304, 307-308, 149 A. 2d 10 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"AFq\">The broker argues, and the trial court seemed alternatively to hold, that even if the agreement provided that settlement was a condition to the broker\u2019s right to a commission from the purchasers, the purchasers\u2019 default prevented the settlement, and the purchasers \u201ccannot set up [their] wrongful act as a defense to a claim by the broker.\u201d Leaving aside for present purposes the provision indicating that in the event of the purchasers\u2019 default the broker\u2019s compensation should be one-half of the forfeited deposit, and assuming <em>arguendo </em>that if settlement were prevented by the purchasers\u2019 default or wrongful act, the broker would be entitled to his full commission from the purchasers, the stipulated facts cannot support a finding that the purchasers\u2019 default or wrongful act prevented settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">The sales contract specified that the property was to be sold \u201cfree of encumbrance\u201d and that \u201ctitle is to be good of record . . .; otherwise said deposit is to be returned and sale declared off at the option of the purchaser . . ..\u201d Under these provisions, if the seller could not convey the property \u201cfree of encumbrance\u201d with title \u201cgood of record\u201d on the June 15, 1971 settlement date, the sale could properly be \u201cdeclared off\u201d at the purchasers\u2019 option. The only exception to this was \u201cin case legal steps are necessary to perfect title.\u201d In that event, the contract provided that \u201csuch action must be taken . . . promptly\u201d and that the purchaser will extend the settlement date \u201cfor the period necessary for such prompt action.\u201d It is doubtful that payment or settlement of the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s federal estate tax claim, which resulted in a lien being placed on the property, constituted the taking of \u201clegal steps .. . necessary to perfect title.\u201d However, assuming that it did, the result would be no different. The agreement was that the seller would take action \u201cpromptly\u201d and that the purchasers would extend the settlement. date only for the time \u201cnecessary for such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>prompt action.\u201d It was conceded that no request was made to the purchasers to grant an extension of the settlement date. Nevertheless, they waited almost four months from the settlement date before exercising their option to have the sale \u201cdeclared off,\u201d and five months from the time of the tax lien, for the seller to satisfy the tax claim. The period given to the seller was obviously sufficient to constitute an extension \u201cnecessary for . . . prompt action.\u201d Under the facts of this case, there is no basis for concluding that the purchasers\u2019 \u201cdefault\u201d or \u201cwrongful act\u201d frustrated the settlement.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed. Appellee to pay costs.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b62-9\">. Cohen apparently was acting on behalf of Cohen-Meisel Associates, a partnership comprised of himself and one Joel Meisel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b67-6\"><em>. </em>The appellants make two other arguments for reversal of the judgment. They claim that the phrase in Art. 21, \u00a7 14-105, that the contract of sale must be \u201cvalid, binding and enforceable\u201d in order to entitle a broker to his commission upon the mere signing of the contract, requires that the broker produce a customer \u201cready, willing and able\u201d to buy or sell, as the case may be, on the principal\u2019s terms, and that the seller in this case was not \u201cready, willing and able.\u201d The appellants also maintain that the broker\u2019s receipt of a full commission based upon the sale of the subject property to someone else, precludes under the circumstances of this case the broker\u2019s recovery of a second commission from them. Because of our holding that the parties entered into a \u201cspecial agreement\u201d as to when the broker was entitled to his commission, we do not reach these alternative arguments.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
