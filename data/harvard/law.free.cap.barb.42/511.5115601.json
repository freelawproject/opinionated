The defendant having appeared, the plaintiff served the defendant with a complaint, stating the place of trial to be in the county of New York. The defendant having answered, the plaintiff served an amended complaint, stating the place of trial to be in the county of Oneida. The defendant now moved to set aside the amended complaint for irregularity.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b513-10\">\n<em>A. S. Van Duzer,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ah2K\">for the motion, insisted that the place of trial was fixed by the summons and complaint; and could not be changed except on motion. <em>(Bangs </em>v. <em>Selden, </em>13 <em>How. </em>163.) The code, \u00a7 126, expressly provides how the place of trial shall be changed, viz. \u201cby order of the court.\u201d A plaintiff has no more right to change the place of trial by merely amending his complaint than the court would have power at any stage of the cause to change it on a motion to amend, instead of a motion under section 126. Section 172</p>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b514-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>has always been regarded with some qualifications and restrictions. (3 <em>Code Rep. </em>189. 6 <em>How. </em>321. 1 <em>Code Rep. </em>[N. <em>S] </em>318.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b514-6\"><em>Charles Tracy, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A2j7\">The statement of the place of trial is part of the complaint, <em>(Code, </em>\u00a7 142,) and therefore is amendable, of course. The former general rules of court, authorizing amendments of course, are incorporated into the code. <em>(Rules, </em>1790, <em>No. </em>8; 1830, <em>No. </em>23; 1837, <em>No. </em>24; 1847, <em>No. </em>22. <em>Code, </em>\u00a7 172. <em>Code of </em>1848; \u00a7 109.) Those rules were held to allow an amendment of the declaration by change of venue, <em>(Wakeman </em>v. <em>Sprague, </em>7 <em>Cowen, </em>164, 165, 166; <em>Hitchcock ads. Post, 1 Wend. </em>16,) and the code was designed to continue that practice. The notice in the summons, of the place where the complaint will be filed, was first required in 1849, and not being in the rfriginal code of 1848, (\u00a7 109,) this change in the form of the summons does not affect the right to amend the complaint, given by the code in 1848, and still in force without change. After appearance and answer, the summons is of no importance.</p>\n<court data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b514-11\">[New York Special Teem,</court>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AHt\">August 9, 1864.</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b514-9\">\n<em>By the Court,</em>\n</p>\n<author id=\"Aa0\">Geo.
