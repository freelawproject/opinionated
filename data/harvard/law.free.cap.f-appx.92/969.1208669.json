Amare claims he was denied due process and substantial evidence supports his claim for asylum. We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-24\">Amare claims his right to due process was violated when the immigration judge \u201ctook over\u201d the direct examination. We note that Amare failed to raise this claim to the Board. Accordingly, we will not review the claim. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1); <em>Lonyem v. United States Att. General, </em>352 F.3d 1338, 1339 n. 5 (11th Cir.2003); <em>Abdulrahman v. Ashcroft, </em>330 F.3d 587, 594-95 (3d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"970\">*970</page-number>A determination of eligibility for asylum or withholding is conclusive if supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole. <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). Administrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B) (2000). We will reverse the Board \u201conly if \u2018the evidence presented was so compelling that no reasonable fact-finder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 325 n. 14 (4th Cir.2002) (quoting <em>Huaman-Cornelio v. Board of Immigration Appeals, </em>979 F.2d 995, 999 (4th Cir.1992) (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-4\">We find the evidence does not compel relief for Amare. Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-5\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
