Turner, Texas prisoner #498120, has filed a motion for leave to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>(IFP) on appeal, following the district court\u2019s dismissal of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 civil rights action. By moving for IFP status, Turner is challenging the district court\u2019s certification that IFP status should not be granted on appeal because his appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-24\">As Turner has not identified a nonfrivolous issue for appeal, his request for IFP status is DENIED, and his appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 &amp; n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2. The dismissal of this appeal as frivolous counts as a \u201cstrike\u201d for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 385-87 (5th Cir.1996). Turner therefore has two \u201cstrikes\u201d under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), including the one imposed by the district court. Turner is warned that if he accumulates three \u201cstrikes\u201d pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), he may not proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">IFP DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS; STRIKE WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b128-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
