He appeals his sentence, arguing that the district court erred in calculating his criminal history, <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7\u00a7 4A1.1, 4A1.2(e) (2002), and in applying the sentencing guidelines for crack offenses, which he challenges on equal protection grounds. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-22\">The district court determined that Moore was in criminal history category III, but departed downward to category II pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3, p.s. Moore contends that the district court erred in awarding him one criminal history point under \u00a7 4Al.l(c) for each of the following sentences: (1) two years unsupervised probation for driving with a revoked license in North Carolina in 1994; (2) two sentences of twelve months unsupervised probation for driving with a revoked license in North Carolina in 1995 and 1997; (3) twelve months unsupervised probation for misdemeanor breach of peace in North Carolina in 2001; and (4) for a conviction for shoplifting in Florida in 1994.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b76-23\">Moore first argues that his North Carolina driver\u2019s license was revoked because he failed to pay outstanding traffic tickets and that a revocation of this nature is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>the kind of offense intended by the Sentencing Commission to be counted under \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(l), but is instead similar to minor traffic infractions and petty offenses listed in \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(2). Guideline section 4A1.2(c)(2) identifies specific petty offenses and directs that sentences for those offenses, and others similar to them, are never counted in a defendant\u2019s criminal history. However, driving on a revoked or suspended license is listed in \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(l) as an offense for which the sentence must be counted if the sentence was a term of probation of at least one year or at least thirty days imprisonment. The elements of Moore\u2019s offense are the same as for the offense of driving on a revoked or suspended license, which is listed in \u00a7 4A1.2(e)(l). Therefore, we find that these sentences were properly counted under \u00a7 4Al.l(c)(l). <em>See United States v. Harris, </em>128 F.3d 850, 853-55 (4th Cir.1997) (approving elements test as consistent with the plain meaning of \u201csimilar\u201d). The reason for the license revocation is immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">Moore\u2019s sentence for breach of the peace (described in the presentence report as \u201ca large street fight\u201d in which Moore \u201curged the crowd to disregard the orders of the responding officers\u201d) could be counted even if it was a municipal or ordinance violation because \u00a7 4A1.2(c) may include such offenses. <em>United States v. Rayner, </em>2 F.3d 286, 287 (8th Cir.1993). Moore speculates that, because he was not charged with a criminal offense such as disorderly conduct or obstructing an officer, his conduct was most analogous to loitering, an offense not counted under \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(2). We disagree. One of the offenses listed in \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(1) is disturbing the peace. The district court correctly determined that breach of peace and disturbing the peace are nearly identical offenses. Therefore, the court did not err in counting in Moore\u2019s criminal history his sentence of twelve months probation for breach of peace.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">Moore alleges error in that one criminal history point was recommended in the presentence report under \u00a7 4Al.l(c) for his shoplifting conviction although there was no information about any sentence that may have been imposed. Because criminal history points under \u00a7 4Al.l(a)-(c) are awarded for sentences, not convictions, no points were due for the shoplifting conviction alone. Although the district court did not explicitly grant Moore\u2019s objection, it did not count the shoplifting conviction when adding Moore\u2019s criminal history points. Thus, no error occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-8\">Moore argues that no criminal history points should have been awarded for his sentences of unsupervised probation, reasoning that such sentences are not serious enough to warrant inclusion in a defendant\u2019s criminal history. The guidelines do not make any distinction between supervised and unsupervised probation and we will not infer any difference. The fact that the term \u201cprobation\u201d is not defined, as is \u201csentence of imprisonment,\u201d in \u00a7 4A1.2(b), indicates that it includes both supervised and unsupervised probation. <em>See United States v. Harris, </em>204 F.3d 681, 682-83 (6th Cir.2000) (upholding award of criminal history points under \u00a7 4Al.l(c)(l) for Ohio sentences that are functional equivalent of unsupervised probation).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-9\">Moore makes the related argument that, because he was under a sentence of unsupervised probation when he committed the instant offense, the court should not have awarded him two criminal history points under \u00a7 4Al.l(d). We find no merit in this claim. <em>See United States v. Mason, </em>74 F.3d 890, 891 (8th Cir.1996) (holding that \u201cprobation,\u201d as used in \u00a7 4A1.1(d), means both supervised and unsupervised probation).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>Last, Moore argues that the sentencing guidelines for crack offenses violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution because they affect more black defendants than white defendants. This court has repeatedly upheld the constitutionality of the guidelines for crack offenses on this ground. <em>See United States v. Ford, </em>88 F.3d 1350, 1365 (4th Cir.1996) (listing previous decisions). Therefore, we find no merit in this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">Accordingly, we affirm the sentence imposed by the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b76-16\">When the presentence report was prepared, the probation officer was awaiting information about the Florida shoplifting conviction, but no further evidence was presented to the district court concerning the sentence. Moore maintained that he posted bond and was released, and that there were no further proceedings.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
