He contends that his prior conviction for a non-residential burglary is not an aggravated felony because the offense did not \u201ccontemplate violence or actual use of physical force against a victim.\u201d He asserts that only a four-level increase under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(D) was warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-26\">We review the district court\u2019s application of the Sentencing Guidelines <em>de novo. United States v. Rodriguez-Rodrignez, </em>323 F.3d 317, 318 (5th Cir.2003). The 2002 version of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, under which Garcia-Marquez was sentenced, provides for an eight-level increase to the base offense level if the defendant previously was deported after a conviction for an aggravated felony. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-27\">An aggravated felony is defined by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43). U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"988\">*988</page-number>comment, (n.2). Section 1101(a)(43)(G), 8 U.S.C., provides that an aggravated felony includes \u201ca theft offense (including receipt of stolen property) or burglary offense for which the term of imprisonment [is] at least one year.\u201d Garcia-Marquez was convicted in Kansas in 1995 for non-residential burglary and was sentenced to sixteen months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-4\">The district court did not commit error by increasing Garcia-Marquez\u2019s base offense level by eight levels for a prior aggravated felony. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1017-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
