For the first time on appeal, Balderas argues that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) is unconstitutional on its face because it treats a prior conviction of a felony or aggravated felony as a sentencing factor and not as an element of the offense. He acknowledges, however, that this argument is contrary to <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), which holds that enhanced penalties under \u00a7 1326(b) are sentencing provisions, not elements of a separate offense. <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), did not overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>and we must follow <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>\u201cunless and until the Supreme Court determines to overrule it.\u201d <em>United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000). Balderas\u2019s conviction and sentence are therefore AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-22\">Balderas also asserts that we should remand for correction of a clerical error in the judgment pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 36. Because this argument does not fall within the scope of Balderas\u2019s sentence-appeal waiver, we remand for the limited purpose of correcting the judgment to reflect that the offense of conviction was attempted illegal reentry rather than being \u201cfound in\u201d the United States illegally. <em>See United States v. Angeles-Mascote, </em>206 F.3d 529, 531 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-23\">AFFIRMED; REMANDED FOR THE LIMITED PURPOSE OF CORRECTING CLERICAL ERROR IN JUDGMENT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1020-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
