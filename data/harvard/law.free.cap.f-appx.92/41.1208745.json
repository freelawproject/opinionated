With regard to Litman\u2019s claims unrelated to retaliation, we have reviewed the record and find no error. Accordingly, we affirm as to those claims on the reasoning of the district court. <em>See Litman v. George Mason Univ., </em>No. CA-97-1755-A (E.D.Va., Jan. 22, 1998; Filed May 7,1998, &amp; Entered May 8, 1998; Filed June 14, 2000, &amp; Entered Jun. 15, 2000; Feb. 26, 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-12\">With regard to Litman\u2019s remaining claim of retaliation, after entry of final judgment in the district court, this court decided <em>Peters v. Jenney, </em>327 F.3d 307 (4th Cir.2003), holding that Title VI confers a private right of action for retaliation. Because Title VI and Title IX are to be interpreted in the same manner, <em>see Cannon v. University of Chicago, </em>441 U.S. 677, 694-96, 99 S.Ct. 1946, 60 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979), the decision in <em>Peters </em>compels the conclusion that Title IX likewise includes a private right of action for retaliation. Accordingly, we vacate that part of the district court\u2019s order dismissing Litman\u2019s retaliation claim and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-13\">We deny Litman\u2019s pending motions to compel supplemental briefing and to file a reply brief. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-14\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
