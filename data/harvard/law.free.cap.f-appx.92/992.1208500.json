Alexander contends that the district court erred in departing upward from a guideline sentencing range of 41 to 51 months. Because Alexander\u2019s sentences should be affirmed under any standard of review, his motion to stay this appeal is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-21\">Alexander argues that the fact that he was convicted of two offenses did not support the district court\u2019s upward departure. The record supports the district court\u2019s findings that Alexander\u2019s offenses were atypically serious and were not adequately taken into account by the sentencing guidelines. Alexander does not contest the district court\u2019s finding that threatening letters he had written also reflected that his criminal history category significantly under-represented the seriousness of his criminal history.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-22\">Arguably, the district court did impermissibly base the departure, in part, on Alexander\u2019s prior firearm-related arrests that did not result in conviction. <em>See United States v. Cantu-Dominguez, </em>898 F.2d 968, 970-71 (5th Cir.1990). However, the district court\u2019s remaining reasons were valid and sufficient to support its upward departure. <em>See Williams v. United States, </em>503 U.S. 193, 203-04, 112 S.Ct. 1112, 117 L.Ed.2d 341 (1992). Moreover, the extent of the departure was reasonable. <em>See United States v. Daughenbaugh, </em>49 F.3d 171, 174-75 (5th Cir.1995); <em>United States v. Ashburn, </em>38 F.3d 803, 809 (5th Cir.1994) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-23\">MOTION TO STAY APPEAL DENIED; JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1022-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
