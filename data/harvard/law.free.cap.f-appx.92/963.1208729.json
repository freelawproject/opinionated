The district court sentenced Toro to 372 months in prison. Toro timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-10\">Toro\u2019s appellate counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), raising two issues regarding Toro\u2019s sentence: (1) whether the district court erroneously attributed over 150 kilograms of cocaine to Toro; and (2) whether the district court erroneously determined that Toro was an organizer or leader of the criminal activity. Toro has filed a pro se supplemental brief addressing the same issues. The Government has elected not to file a brief. We find no error in either of these sentencing determinations by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-11\">We have independently reviewed the entire record in this case in accordance with <em>Anders </em>and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Toro\u2019s convictions and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-13\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
