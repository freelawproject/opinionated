His guideline range was 210-262 months. He was sentenced to 120 months on each count, with the sentences on Counts Two and Three to run concurrently with each other and consecutively to the sentence on Count One, for a total sentence of 240 months. Bijou appeals, arguing that his sentence violates the rule of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-22\">Bijou contends that his sentence was enhanced in violation of <em>Apprendi </em>based on conduct charged in two counts that were dismissed. In <em>Apprendi, </em>the Supreme Court held, \u201cOther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 490. <em>Apprendi </em>does not require that a jury decide facts that increase a guideline range but do not increase the statutory maximum sentence. <em>United States v. Kinter, </em>235 F.3d 192, 201-02 (4th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b996-23\">Further, if a defendant stands convicted on multiple counts of an indictment and the guidelines mandate a sentencing range that is greater than the highest statutory maximum of any single count, the district court must impose consecutive terms of imprisonment to achieve a punishment within the guideline range. USSG \u00a7 5G1.2(d); <em>United States v. White, </em>238 F.3d 537, 542-43 (4th Cir.2001). There is no <em>Apprendi </em>violation in such a situation unless the defendant is sentenced to more than the statutory maximum on any of the counts of conviction. <em>Id.; see United States v. White, </em>240 F.3d 127, 135 (2nd Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b997-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"967\">*967</page-number>Applying these principles, because Bijou did not receive more than the statutory maximum of ten years on any of the counts of conviction, <em>Apprendi </em>does not preclude enhancement of the sentence based on conduct that was the subject of dismissed counts. Additionally, the district court was obligated under the guidelines and case law to impose consecutive terms of imprisonment in order that Bijou receive a sentence within the guideline range of 210-264 months. Bijou\u2019s 240-month sentence does not offend <em>Apprendi.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b997-5\">We accordingly affirm. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
