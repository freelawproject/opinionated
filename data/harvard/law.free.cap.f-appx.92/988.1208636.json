He argues that the district court erred in finding that he possessed a firearm during the offense for purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) and erred in concluding that he was ineligible for the \u201csafety valve\u201d reduction of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-21\">As part of his written plea agreement, Easley agreed to waive the right to appeal his conviction and sentence. The district court personally addressed Easley and admonished him regarding his waiver; Easley stated that he understood the waiver. Thus, he knowingly and voluntarily waived the right to appeal his sentence. <em>See United States v. Robinson, </em>187 F.3d 516, 517-18 (5th Cir.1999). Accordingly, this appeal is DISMISSED as waived.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1018-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
