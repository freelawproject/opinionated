Morrison contends on appeal that the district court abused its discretion in permitting the government to cross-examine him about his prior misdemeanor convictions for carrying a concealed weapon and erred in sentencing him as a career offender. <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 4B1.1 (2002). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-19\">Morrison was convicted of illegally possessing ammunition on February 25, 2002, and on August 31, 2002, and of possessing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"941\">*941</page-number>crack cocaine with intent to distribute on the latter date. Testifying in his own defense, Morrison denied all the charged conduct, contradicting the testimony of the various government witnesses, including testimony indicating that he had possessed a firearm as well as ammunition on February 25. On direct examination, Morrison denied possessing either a gun or ammunition on February 25, 2002. Later in his direct testimony he acknowledged that he had pled guilty to carrying a concealed weapon on that date, but resolved the inconsistency by testifying that he did not know to what charge he entered a guilty plea. He thus avoided an acknowledgment that his guilty plea was an admission that he had in fact possessed a gun on February 25. Although Morrison was not on trial for possession of a firearm on February 25, his denial of that fact was part of his defense of claiming that all allegations of unlawful possession made against him by the government\u2019s witnesses were untrue. Under cross-examination, Morrison stated that he had pled guilty to the February 25 charge of carrying a concealed weapon even though he was not guilty, and did not understand that his guilty plea was an admission that he had actually possessed a firearm on February 25. The district court ruled that the government could introduce evidence of Morrison\u2019s three prior convictions for carrying a concealed weapon to impeach his claim that he did not understand the legal effect of a conviction of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-5\">Evidence of a defendant\u2019s \u201cother crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove\u201d bad character but may be admissible to prove \u201cmotive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident____\u201d Fed. R.Evid. 404(b). Such evidence may not be more prejudicial than probative. Fed. R.Evid. 408. Evidence of prior conduct is admissible under Rule 404(b) and 403 if it is (1) \u201cnecessary in the sense that it is probative of an essential claim or an element of the offense;\u201d (2) rehable, and (3) \u201cits probative value\u201d is not \u201csubstantially outweighed by confusion or unfair prejudice in the sense that it tends to subordinate reason to emotion in the factfinding process.\u201d <em>United States v. Queen, </em>132 F.3d 991, 997 (4th Cir.1997). The district court\u2019s decision to admit evidence <em>of </em>prior bad acts is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>Id. </em>at 998. In <em>United States v. Lamarr, </em>75 F.3d 964, 970-71 (4th Cir.1996), this court held that evidence necessary to prove a defendant\u2019s lack of credibility is an issue separate from character that satisfies Rule 404(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b971-8\">Evidence of a prior felony conviction is admissible under Fed.R.Evid. 609 for the purpose of attacking the credibility of a defendant. <em>Lamarr, </em>75 F.3d at 970. Generally, a prior misdemeanor conviction is admissible under the rule for attacking credibility only if the crime involved dishonesty or false statement. Fed. R.Evid. 609(a)(2). However, Rule 609 \u201cdoes not address the admissibility of pri- or convictions when they are offered for another purpose.\u201d <em>United States v. Norton, </em>26 F.3d 240, 243 (1st Cir.1994) (conviction sustained more than ten years earlier, beyond Rule 609\u2019s time limit, was properly admitted to contradict defendant\u2019s misleading assertion). Thus, Rule 609 does not prevent the introduction of any prior conviction that is offered to prove the falsity of testimony offered by the defendant in his direct examination concerning a material issue. <em>Id. </em>at 243-44 (citations omitted). Applying these principles, we conclude that the rule did not preclude introduction of Morrison\u2019s prior misdemeanor conviction for carrying a concealed weapon under the circumstances, and the evidence was not unfairly prejudicial to him. Therefore, the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"942\">*942</page-number>court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-4\">Next, although Morrison concedes that his 1989 conviction for assault with a deadly weapon inflicting serious bodily injury, an offense committed when he was sixteen, was an adult conviction, he argues that it should not have been treated as a predicate conviction for career offender status, nor should the sentence have been counted in his criminal history, because his North Carolina committed youthful offender sentence was a quasi-juvenile sentence. Legal questions concerning the district court\u2019s application of the sentencing guidelines are reviewed de novo. <em>United States v. Bacon, </em>94 F.3d 158, 161 (4th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b972-5\">A defendant is a career offender if (1) he was at least eighteen years old when he committed the instant offense, (2) the instant offense is a felony that is either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense, and (3) he has at least two prior felony convictions for either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense. A prior felony conviction must be \u201ca prior adult federal or state conviction for an offense punishable by death or imprisonment for an offense exceeding one year.... \u201d USSG \u00a7 4A1.2, comment. (n.l). A conviction sustained before age eighteen may qualify as a predicate conviction \u201cif it is classified as an adult conviction under the laws of the jurisdiction in which the defendant was convicted.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b972-6\">Morrison relies on <em>United States v. Mason, </em>284 F.3d 555 (4th Cir.2002) (holding that adult conviction for which juvenile sentence imposed may not be predicate conviction under \u00a7 4B1.1). Morrison\u2019s reliance on <em>Mason </em>is misplaced, as it deals with a West Virginia sentencing scheme that permits a defendant under eighteen who is convicted as an adult to be sentenced as a juvenile, while the North Carolina Youthful Offender Act had no similar provision.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> A youthful offender sentence was one type of adult sentence. Because <em>Mason </em>is inapposite, Morrison has not demonstrated that the district court erred in deciding that his North Carolina committed youthful offender sentence was an adult sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-9\">We therefore affirm the sentence imposed by the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b972-7\">The Youthful Offender Act was repealed in 1995. <em>See </em>N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 148-49.10 (2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
