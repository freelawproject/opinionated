Having carefully reviewed the summary judgment record, the comprehensive opinion of the district court, the appellate arguments of counsel in their respective appellate briefs, and the applicable law, we are satisfied that the rulings of the district court should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-25\">Counsel for both parties have favored this court with excellent briefing, presenting their respective legal positions forcefully yet professionally, identifying the issues and advancing their arguments cogently and clearly. In the end, however, the legal arguments advanced by O\u2019Brien to reverse the district court\u2019s dismissal of his action on summary judgment do not carry the day. The district court correctly ruled that the express choice of Delaware law in the Stock Option Agreement applies, and that ruling is not erroneous in being based on the plain wording of that Agreement only. Neither is there anything in the summary judgment record to implicate that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"998\">*998</page-number>O\u2019Brien\u2019s termination by Lucent implicated a denial or forfeiture of benefits as a matter of timing or purpose. In the end, we are convinced that the careful analysis set forth in the district court\u2019s Order filed October 20, 2003 squarely hits the mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-4\">Primarily for the reasons given by the district court, its grant of Lucent\u2019s motion for summary judgment dismissing O\u2019Brien\u2019s action, its denial of O\u2019Brien\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment, and its rejection of O\u2019Brien\u2019s request for attorneys\u2019 fees are, in all respects,</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1027-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
