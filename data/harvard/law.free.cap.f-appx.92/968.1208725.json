We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm substantially on the reasoning of the district court.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> <em>See Boykin v. Mineta, </em>No. CA-03-477-A (E.D. Va. filed Aug. 29, 2003 <em>&amp; </em>entered Sept. 3, 2003). We grant the Government\u2019s motion to strike Boykin\u2019s attachments to his informal brief, and we deny Boykin\u2019s motion to supplement the record. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b999-16\"> To the extent the district court dismissed Boy-kin's retaliation claim on the basis that it was not exhausted, we note that exhaustion is not required with regard to retaliation claims like the one at issue here. <em>See Nealon v. Stone, </em>958 F.2d 584, 590 (4th Cir. 1992). However, because we conclude that Boykin fails to support his claim of retaliation, the district court\u2019s judgment need not be disturbed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
