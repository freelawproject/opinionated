Thomas, III, pled guilty to one count of sexual exploitation of a minor, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2251(a) (2000), and was sentenced to 120 months imprisonment, followed by three years of supervised release. He appeals, claiming that his conduct \u2014 videotaping the genitalia of a sleeping child \u2014 did not constitute \u201cen-gaging\u201d in sexually explicit conduct within the meaning of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-11\">Thomas\u2019 conviction was based on a VHS-videotape discovered during a search of Thomas\u2019 apartment; the tape depicts a sleeping nine-year-old girl \u2014 the child of Thomas\u2019 next door neighbor. The camera zooms in on the child\u2019s panties; shortly thereafter, Thomas\u2019 hand is seen moving aside the crotch of the panties and the child\u2019s exposed genitals are filmed for approximately two minutes. The child is apparently asleep throughout the entire incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-12\">Section 2251(a) provides, in pertinent part, that\u201d[a]ny person who employs, uses, persuades, induces, entices, or coerces any minor to engage in ... any sexually explicit conduct for the purpose of producing any visual depiction of such conduct, shall be punished as provided under subsection (d).\u201d We find that the facts as set forth above satisfy the elements in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-14\">Accordingly, we affirm Thomas\u2019 conviction. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-15\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
