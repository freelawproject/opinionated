Adkins appeals from the district court\u2019s judgment revoking her term of supervised release. On appeal, Adkins asserts the district court erred in concluding she violated the terms of her supervised release by violating the law and by drinking excessive amounts of alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-21\">This court reviews a district court\u2019s order revoking supervised release for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Copley, </em>978 F.2d 829, 831 (4th Cir.1992). Adkins\u2019 claim is meritless. The Government\u2019s evidence was sufficient to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that Adkins violated the terms governing her supervised release. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b993-22\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s revocation of Adkins\u2019 supervised release and its consequent imposition of imprisonment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-23\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
