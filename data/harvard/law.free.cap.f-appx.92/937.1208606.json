He was sentenced to a total of 365 months imprisonment. On appeal, he argues that: (1) the district court erred in applying <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2A3.1 (1998), relating to criminal sexual abuse; (2) the district court erred in applying USSG \u00a7 3C1.1 for obstructing the administration of justice; and (3) the district court erred in departing upward from the sentencing guidelines for an under-represented criminal history category. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-16\">In general, this court reviews a district court\u2019s factual findings at sentencing for clear error, and its legal application of the sentencing guidelines de novo. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(e) (2000); <em>United States v. Daughtrey, </em>874 F.2d 213, 217 (4th Cir.1989). In conducting this review, this Court gives due regard to the district court\u2019s opportunity to judge the credibility of witnesses. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(e). Credibility determinations by the factfinder are rarely disturbed on appeal. <em>United States v. Saunders, </em>886 F.2d 56, 60 (4th Cir.1989). Having reviewed the record, we find no error in the district court\u2019s enhancements under USSG \u00a7 2A3.1 and USSG \u00a7 3C1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-17\">With respect to the upward departure, York maintains that the district court erred in departing upward from the sentencing guidelines range under USSG <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"939\">*939</page-number>\u00a7 4A1.3, on the ground that his criminal history category did not adequately reflect the seriousness of his past criminal conduct or the likelihood that he would commit other crimes. Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742, as amended by the Prosecutorial Remedies and Other Tools to end the Exploitation of Children Today Act of 2003 (\u201cPROTECT Act\u201d), Pub.L. No. 108-21, \u00a7 401(d), 117 Stat. 650, 670 (2003), whether the district court based a departure on a permissible factor is to be reviewed de novo. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(e); <em>see United States v. Stockton, </em>349 F.3d 755, 764 n. 4 (4th Cir.2003) (discussing PROTECT Act and holding that the application of newly enacted de novo standard of review in a pending case does not implicate the Ex Post Facto Clause). The court must determine whether the departure was based on a factor that (1) does not advance the objectives set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2) (2000), or (2) is not authorized by \u00a7 3553(b), or (3) is not justified by the facts of the case. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 401(d), 117 Stat. at 670; 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(e)(3)(B)(i)-(iii). Assuming a permissible ground for departure, the reviewing court must ask whether the district court\u2019s sentence \u201cdeparts to an unreasonable degree from the applicable guidelines range.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(e)(3)(C). In reviewing the degree of departure, due deference is given to the district court, and the reviewing court shall accept the findings of fact of the district court unless they are clearly erroneous. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b969-7\">A departure under USSG \u00a7 4A1.3 because the criminal history category under-represents the defendant\u2019s past criminal conduct and the likelihood of recidivism is encouraged by the guidelines. <em>United States v. Bellamy, </em>264 F.3d 448, 456 (4th Cir.2001), <em>cert. denied, </em>534 U.S. 1143, 122 S.Ct. 1097, 151 L.Ed.2d 994 (2002). Therefore, this factor constitutes a permissible ground for an upward departure. Contrary to York\u2019s assertions, we further find that the court\u2019s departure in this case was supported by the facts, that the departure from criminal history category III to VI was not unreasonable, and that the court adequately justified the extent of the departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-9\">Accordingly, we affirm York\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
