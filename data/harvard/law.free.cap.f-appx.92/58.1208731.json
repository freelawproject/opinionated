We may exercise jurisdiction only over final orders, see 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 (2000), and certain interlocutory and collateral orders. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292 (2000); Fed. R.Civ.P. 54(b); <em>Cohen v. Beneficial Indus. Loan Corp., </em>337 U.S. 541, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949). The Supreme Court has long held that a pre-trial order denying a motion to reduce bail in a criminal prosecution is appealable as a collateral order. <em>See Stack v. Boyle, </em>342 U.S. 1, 12, 72 S.Ct. 1, 96 L.Ed. 3 (1951). The majority of the circuits have extended the collateral order doctrine to encompass an order denying a motion for release on bail pending disposition of a habeas corpus petition or a motion to vacate under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2254, 2255 (2000). <em>See, e.g., Lee v. Jabe, </em>989 F.2d 869, 870 (6th Cir.1993); <em>Dotson v. Clark, </em>900 F.2d 77, 78 (6th Cir. 1990); <em>United States v. Smith, </em>835 F.2d 1048, 1049 (3d Cir.1987); <em>Martin v. Solem, </em>801 F.2d 324, 328 (8th Cir.1986); <em>Guerra v. Meese, </em>786 F.2d 414, 418 (D.C.Cir.1986); <em>Cherek v. United States, </em>767 F.2d 335, 337 (7th Cir.1985); <em>Iuteri v. Nardoza, </em>662 F.2d 159, 161 (2d Cir.1981). Following the reasoning of these decisions, we consider the district court\u2019s denial of Dorsey\u2019s motion to be a final order under the collateral order doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-21\">An appeal may not be taken from the final order in a \u00a7 2255 proceeding unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000). A certificate of appealability will not issue for claims addressed by a district court absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). A prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find both that his constitutional claims are debatable and that any dispositive procedural rulings by the district court are also debatable or wrong. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 683 (4th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>Cir.2001). We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Dorsey has not made the requisite showing. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
