Finding no error in the district court\u2019s determinations, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-22\">We review the factual findings underlying a motion to suppress for clear error and review the legal determinations de novo. <em>See Ornelas v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 690, 699, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996); <em>United States v. Rusher, </em>966 F.2d 868, 873 (4th Cir.1992). When a suppression motion has been denied, this court reviews the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government. <em>See United States v. Seidman, </em>156 F.3d 542, 547 (4th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-23\">On appeal, Matthews argues that the district court erred in denying his suppression motion because the police officers did not have the requisite reasonable suspicion that he was involved in criminal activity prior to initiating their questions to him. The Supreme Court has repeatedly held that mere police questioning is not a seizure. <em>INS v. Delgado, </em>466 U.S. 210, 215-16, 104 S.Ct. 1758, 80 L.Ed.2d 247 (1984); <em>Florida v. Bostick, </em>501 U.S. 429, 434, 111 S.Ct. 2382, 115 L.Ed.2d 389 (1991). \u201c[T]he critical test is whether, taking into account all of the circumstances surrounding the encounter, the police conduct would \u2018have communicated to a reasonable person that he was not at liberty to ignore the police presence and go about his business.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bostick, </em>501 U.S. at 437 (quoting <em>Michigan v. Chestemut, </em>486 U.S. 567, 569, 108 S.Ct. 1975, 100 L.Ed.2d 565 (1988)). The fact that a person responds to or complies with a police request does not change the consensual nature of an encounter. <em>Delgado, </em>466 U.S. at 216, 104 S.Ct. 1758.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-24\">In evaluating the consensual nature of a police-citizen encounter, we consider the following factors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>the time, place and purposes of the encounter, the words used by the officer, the officer\u2019s tone of voice and general demeanor, the officer\u2019s statements to others present during the encounter, the threatening presence of several officers, the potential display of a weapon by an officer, and the physical touching by the police of the citizen.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b86-4\"><em>United States v. Weaver, 282 </em>F.3d 302, 310 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>537 U.S. 847, 123 S.Ct. 186, 154 L.Ed.2d 75 (2002). Application of these factors to the facts of this case convinces us that the district court correctly denied Matthews\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">Accordingly, we affirm Matthews\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
