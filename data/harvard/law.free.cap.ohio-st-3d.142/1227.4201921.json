Flevares, counsel for Rudolph Joseph Setinsek, has filed an affidavit with the clerk of this court under R.C. 2701.03 seeking to disqualify Judge R.R. Denny Clunk, a retired judge sitting by assignment, from presiding over any further proceedings in the above-captioned cases and all other cases in which Flevares appears as counsel before Judge Clunk. Judge Clunk is currently assigned to hear all of Flevares\u2019s probate cases in Trumbull County because Trumbull County Probate Court Judge Thomas A. Swift recused himself from Flevares\u2019s matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-11\">{\u00b6 2} Flevares claims Judge Clunk is biased against him because, he alleges, (1) the judge engaged in an improper ex parte communication with Judge Swift, (2) the judge\u2019s language in a recent order wrongfully accused Flevares of making \u201cintentional representations,\u201d (3) the judge has refused to comply with a public-records request, and (4) the judge communicated information to Flevares\u2019s clients that should have remained private. Judge Clunk has responded in writing to the allegations in Flevares\u2019s affidavit, denying any personal bias against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-14\">{\u00b6 3} For the reasons explained below, no basis has been established to order the disqualification of Judge Clunk.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-15\">{\u00b6 4} First, Flevares has not demonstrated that Judge Clunk\u2019s alleged ex parte communication with Judge Swift mandates the judge\u2019s disqualification. Jud. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1228\">*1228</page-number>Cond.R. 2.9 directs that judges \u201cshall not initiate, receive, permit, or consider ex parte communications,\u201d and the comments to that rule further state that although a judge may consult with other judges, a judge \u201cmust avoid ex parte discussions of a case with judges who have previously been disqualified from hearing the matter.\u201d Jud.Cond.R. 2.9, comment [5]. \u201cIn affidavit of disqualification proceedings, however, the question is not whether the judge has violated the Code of Judicial Conduct, but whether the ex parte communication demonstrates bias or prejudice on the part of the judge.\u201d <em>In re Disqualification of Sheward, </em>134 Ohio St.3d 1226, 2012-Ohio-6289, 982 N.E.2d 717, \u00b6 12. To satisfy this test, the communication must address a substantive matter in the case, and the allegations must be substantiated and consist of something more than hearsay or speculation. <em>Id.; In re Disqualification of Forsthoefel, </em>135 Ohio St.3d 1316, 2013-Ohio-2292, 989 N.E.2d 62, \u00b6 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">{\u00b6 5} Here, Flevares\u2019s claim is based on a letter from Judge Swift in which he states that Judge Clunk notified him of objections to a magistrate\u2019s decision that Flevares had recently filed and that Judge Clunk described the language in Flevares\u2019s objections as \u201cegregious\u201d and showing \u201cblatant contempt\u201d for Judge Swift. Flevares argues that Judge Swift\u2019s letter is \u201cproof\u2019 that the two judges engaged in an improper ex parte communication. For his part, Judge Clunk acknowledges that he told Judge Swift to review Flevares\u2019s objections and that he also stated to Judge Swift that it was obvious from Flevares\u2019s objections that Flevares did not like Judge Swift. Based on this record, it appears that the judges\u2019 communication was limited to the language and tone used in Flevares\u2019s objections, rather than any substantive matter in the underlying cases. Therefore, Flevares has failed to substantiate his claim that Judge Clunk\u2019s communication with Judge Swift demonstrates bias or prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">{\u00b6 6} Second, contrary to Flevares\u2019s contention, Judge Clunk\u2019s order responding to Flevares\u2019s objections does not establish that he is biased against Flevares. In his objections, Flevares argued that the magistrate had never held a hearing on a pending matter. It appears, however, that the magistrate had in fact held a hearing, and Judge Clunk found it \u201cobvious\u201d that Flevares was \u201cintentionally misrepresenting\u201d the facts related to that hearing. Flevares concludes that Judge Clunk\u2019s choice of words demonstrates that the judge is biased against him.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-7\">The term \u201cbias or prejudice\u201d \u201cimplies a hostile feeling or spirit of ill-will or undue friendship or favoritism toward one of the litigants or his attorney, with the formation of a fixed anticipatory judgment on the part of the judge, as contradistinguished from an open state of mind which will be governed by the law and the facts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ADz\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1229\">*1229</page-number><em>In re Disqualification of O\u2019Neill, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 1232, 2002-Ohio-7479, 798 N.E.2d 17, \u00b6 14, quoting <em>State ex rel. Pratt v. Weygandt, </em>164 Ohio St. 463, 469, 132 N.E.2d 191 (1956). Judge Clunk\u2019s language does not prove that he has hostility toward Flevares or that he has formed a fixed judgment against Flevares\u2019s client. Judge Clunk\u2019s order was based on his interpretation of the arguments raised in Flevares\u2019s objections, and such conclusions are generally not deemed to be the product of bias. <em>See, e.g., In re Disqualification of Baronzzi, </em>138 Ohio St.3d 1210, 2013-Ohio-5899, 3 N.E.3d 1196, \u00b6 9 (\u201cwhen a judge\u2019s opinion regarding a party\u2019s credibility is formed on the basis of evidence presented during the course of the proceedings, that opinion is not deemed to be the product of bias or prejudice\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">{\u00b6 7} Third, Judge Clunk\u2019s alleged failure to comply with Flevares\u2019s public-records request is not grounds for disqualification. \u201cAn affidavit of disqualification addresses the narrow issue of the possible bias or prejudice of a judge. It is not a vehicle to contest matters of substantive or procedural law * * <em>In re Disqualification of Solovan, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 1214, 2003-Ohio-5484, 798 N.E.2d 3, \u00b6 4. Thus, it is not within the scope of this proceeding to evaluate Judge Clunk\u2019s compliance with public-records laws. And regardless, Judge Clunk has indicated that since Flevares filed his affidavit, the judge fulfilled the request.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">{\u00b6 8} Finally, Flevares has not specifically explained how Judge Clunk violated his privacy rights. The record shows that Judge Swift sent letters to the litigants in Flevares\u2019s cases explaining that he recused himself from those matters because Flevares had made accusations against him, which he \u201cself-reported\u201d to disciplinary counsel. Weeks later, Judge Clunk sent similar letters informing the parties that he had been assigned to hear Flevares\u2019s cases and repeating that Judge Swift had recused himself after \u201cself reporting\u201d Flevares\u2019s allegations to disciplinary counsel. Flevares claims that these letters somehow violated a right to keep disciplinary matters private. Gov.Bar R. V(11)(E) requires that all proceedings and documents relating to review and investigation of an attorney-disciplinary grievance remain \u201cprivate\u201d unless the respondent-attorney waives the privacy of the proceedings. Here, Flevares has not explained how <em>his </em>privacy rights were violated by Judge Clunk\u2019s publicly stating that Judge Swift had \u201cself reported\u201d his own conduct to disciplinary counsel, nor has Flevares specifically explained how Judge Clunk\u2019s letters demonstrate bias against Flevares. <em>In re Disqualification of Walker, </em>36 Ohio St.3d 606, 522 N.E.2d 460 (1988) (\u201cvague, unsubstantiated allegations of the affidavit are insufficient on their face for a finding of bias or prejudice\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">{\u00b6 9} For the reasons stated above, the affidavit of disqualification is denied. The cases may proceed before Judge Clunk.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
