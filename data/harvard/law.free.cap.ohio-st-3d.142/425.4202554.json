We hold that it is not. Accordingly, we reverse the decision of the court of appeals and remand this cause to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion and judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-11\">Relevant Background</p>\n<p id=\"b563-12\">{\u00b6 2} Beginning in November 2006, appellee, Tamara Friebel, was employed by appellant Visiting Nurse Association of Mid-Ohio (\u2018VNA\u201d) as a home health nurse to provide in-home health-care services to VNA clients.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-13\">{\u00b6 3} On a typical work day, Friebel traveled from the home of one patient to another in her personal vehicle. At times, she stopped at the office to pick up mail or supplies or to attend meetings. If working on the weekend, Friebel was paid for travel time and mileage from her residence to her first patient\u2019s home as well as for her travel throughout the day and her return home. On weekdays, in contrast, Friebel was paid for travel time and mileage but VNA subtracted 24 miles from the mileage and 30 minutes from the travel time each day to represent the time and distance it would take Friebel to travel back and forth between her home and VNA\u2019s office, regardless of whether she actually reported to the office each day.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-14\">{\u00b6 4} On Saturday, January 22, 2011, Friebel was expected to travel from her home in Shelby, Ohio, to the home of her first patient of the day, who lived in Ontario, Ohio. Friebel decided to transport her daughter, her son, and two family friends to the Richland Mall in Ontario on her way to the patient\u2019s home.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>{\u00b6 5} While stopped at a traffic light before dropping her passengers off, Friebel\u2019s car was hit from behind. Friebel sought workers\u2019 compensation for a neck sprain.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">\n<em>Procedural Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">{\u00b6 6} At every procedural step of this action, the conclusion reached was the opposite of the conclusion reached in the previous step.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">{\u00b6 7} The administrator for the Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation (\u201cBWC\u201d) initially allowed Friebel\u2019s claim for a neck sprain. VNA appealed, and a district hearing officer for the Industrial Commission vacated the administrator\u2019s allowance of the claim, denied the claim, and found that Friebel was not within the course and scope of her employment at the time of the accident. Specifically, the district hearing officer found that Friebel had not yet begun her employment duties at the patient\u2019s house when she was injured, and therefore, denied the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-8\">{\u00b6 8} On Friebel\u2019s appeal, a staff hearing officer of the Industrial Commission vacated the district hearing officer\u2019s order and allowed the claim. The staff hearing officer determined that because the employer had conceded at a hearing that Friebel was to be paid both mileage and for her travel time from her home to the first patient\u2019s home on the day of the injury, the case was distinguishable from those on which the district hearing officer had relied to deny the claim. The Industrial Commission declined further appeal and VNA\u2019s request for reconsideration. VNA then appealed to the Richland County Court of Common Pleas, where Friebel filed a complaint against VNA and the BWC seeking workers\u2019 compensation benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-9\">{\u00b6 9} The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of VNA. The court concluded that there was no dispute that Friebel was on a personal errand at the time she was injured, i.e., transporting her children and others to the mall, and thus, Friebel\u2019s injury neither arose out of nor occurred in the course of her employment. Diverging from the staff hearing officer\u2019s decision, the trial court concluded that it was \u201cimmaterial\u201d that Friebel was paid for travel time and mileage on the weekends because at the time of the injury, Friebel was traveling to the mall and not to work. Friebel appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-10\">{\u00b6 10} In a split decision, the Fifth District Court of Appeals reversed the trial court\u2019s order granting summary judgment and held that, as a matter of law, the accident and injury arose out of and occurred in the course of Friebel\u2019s employment. The court of appeals remanded for proceedings consistent with its holding. The appellate court found that even though Friebel had intended to drop her passengers off at the mall, she had had the dual intent to travel to her patient\u2019s home, and that when she was injured, she had not yet diverted from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>that path. 2013-Ohio-1646, 991 N.E.2d 279, \u00b6 21 (5th Dist.). The appellate court also found that Friebel would not have been at the place where the accident occurred if she had not been performing her employment duties because she was on the route to the patient\u2019s home when she was injured. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 26-27.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">{\u00b6 11} We accepted VNA\u2019s discretionary appeal from the appellate court\u2019s judgment on two issues: (1) whether the dual-intent doctrine applies in Ohio workers\u2019 compensation cases and (2) whether granting summary judgment in favor of a nonmoving party was appropriate. 136 Ohio St.3d 1491, 2013-Ohio-4140, 994 N.E.2d 462.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">{\u00b6 12} An injury compensable under the workers\u2019 compensation system must have occurred \u201cin the course of, and arising out of, the injured employee\u2019s employment.\u201d R.C. 4123.01(C). This court has recognized that both prongs of this statutory definition must be met. <em>Fisher v. Mayfield, </em>49 Ohio St.3d 275, 277, 551 N.E.2d 1271 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">{\u00b6 13} The \u201cin the course of\u2019 prong relates to the time, place, and circumstances of the injury. <em>Id. </em>This prong limits workers\u2019 compensation benefits to employees who sustain injuries while engaged in a required employment duty or activity consistent with their contract for hire and logically related to the employer\u2019s business. <em>Ruckman v. Cubby Drilling, Inc., </em>81 Ohio St.3d 117, 120, 689 N.E.2d 917 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-9\">{\u00b6 14} The \u201carising out of\u2019 prong refers to the causal connection between the employment and the injury, and whether there is sufficient causal connection to satisfy this prong \u201c \u2018depends on the totality of the facts and circumstances surrounding the accident, including: (1) the proximity of the scene of the accident to the place of employment, (2) the degree of control the employer had over the scene of the accident, and (3) the benefit the employer received from the injured employee\u2019s presence at the scene of the accident.\u2019 \u201d <em>Fisher </em>at 277, quoting <em>Lord v. Daugherty, </em>66 Ohio St.2d 441, 423 N.E.2d 96 (1981) syllabus. This list of factors is not exhaustive, however, and an employee may fail to establish one or more of these three factors and still be able to establish the requisite causal connection. <em>Fisher </em>at 279, fn. 2; <em>Ruckman </em>at 122.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-10\">{\u00b6 15} In addition to the factors set out in <em>Fisher, </em>this court acknowledged that \u201csimilar fact patterns have promulgated their own set of rules.\u201d <em>Fisher, </em>49 Ohio St.3d at 280, 551 N.E.2d 1271. For example, for employees who travel regularly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>for work and who are injured away from the workplace during an employment-related trip, courts have generally held that the employee is entitled to benefits unless the injury occurred while the employee was on a personal errand. <em>Woodard v. Cassens Transport Co., </em>3d Dist. Union No. 14-11-22, 2012-Ohio-4015, 2012 WL 3801327.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">{\u00b6 16} For employees with a fixed place of employment, the general rule is that the requisite causal connection is absent when an injury occurs while traveling to or from the workplace \u2014 the \u201ccoming-and-going rule.\u201d <em>MTD Prods., Inc. v. Robatin, </em>61 Ohio St.3d 66, 572 N.E.2d 661 (1991), syllabus; <em>Ruckman, </em>81 Ohio St.3d at 119, 689 N.E.2d 917. Whether a place of employment is \u201cfixed\u201d is a fact-specific inquiry and depends on the facts and circumstances surrounding the employment. <em>Ruckman </em>at 119-120 (holding that even when the employment calls for \u201cperiodic relocation of job sites,\u201d it may still constitute fixed-situs employment).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">{\u00b6 17} Courts recognize various exceptions to the coming-and-going rule. The exceptions apply, for example, when the injury occurred due to a \u201cspecial hazard\u201d inherent in the employment or when the totality of the circumstances otherwise demonstrates a causal connection between the injury and employment. <em>MTD Prods, </em>at 69-70; <em>Ruckman </em>at 120, 123. But whether an employee is a fixed-situs or non-fixed-situs employee, the causal connection must be established in order for the employee to demonstrate that his injuries arose out of his employment. <em>See Crockett v. HCR Manorcare, Inc., </em>4th Dist. Scioto No. 03CA2919, 2004-Ohio-3533, 2004 WL 1486082, \u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">{\u00b6 18} Because workers\u2019 compensation cases are fact specific, no one factor is controlling and \u201c[n]o one test or analysis can be said to apply to each and every factual possibility.\u201d <em>Fisher, </em>49 Ohio St.3d at 280, 551 N.E.2d 1271. The overarching consideration is that the statute must be accorded a liberal construction in favor of awarding benefits. R.C. 4123.95; <em>Fisher </em>at 278.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">\n<em>Dual-Purpose Doctrine in Ohio Workers\u2019 Compensation Law</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">{\u00b6 19} When an employee is injured while traveling for both business and personal purposes, some jurisdictions recognize a dual-intent doctrine, or dual-purpose doctrine. The doctrine grew out of the seminal decision <em>In re Marks v. Gray, </em>251 N.Y. 90, 167 N.E. 181 (1929).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-9\">{\u00b6 20} In <em>Marks, </em>the employee was asked to perform a task for his employer in a neighboring town only because the employee was traveling there for the personal purpose of meeting his wife. <em>Id. </em>at 91-92. The court held that because the travel was for personal reasons and the employee would not have been sent to do the task if he had not been traveling to the town for a personal purpose, workers\u2019 compensation benefits were not available. <em>Id. </em>at 94. The court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>described the test for determining whether a traveling employee is acting in the course of his employment as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-4\">If the work of the employee creates the necessity for travel, he is in the course of his employment, though he is serving at the same time some purpose of his own * * *. If, however, the work has had no part in creating the necessity for travel, if the journey would have gone forward though the business errand had been dropped, and would have been canceled upon failure of the private purpose, though the business errand was undone, the travel is then personal and personal the risk.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b567-5\"><em>Marks </em>at 93-94.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">{\u00b6 21} Since <em>Marks, </em>many states have adopted the doctrine. <em>See, e.g., Jacobs v. Consol. Tel. Co., </em>237 Neb. 772, 775, 467 N.W.2d 864 (1991); <em>Jane Traylor, Inc. v. Cooksey, </em>31 Ark.App. 245, 252, 792 S.W.2d 351 (1990); <em>Swartz v. McDonald\u2019s Corp., </em>788 So.2d 937, 945 (Fla.2001); <em>Jenrett v. Smith, </em>173 W.Va. 325, 332, 315 S.E.2d 583 (1983) (using the <em>Marks </em>test as a tool in determining whether an employee was acting in furtherance of the employer\u2019s business for purposes of tort immunity); <em>contra D &amp; C Builders v. Cullinane, </em>98 Nev. 67, 70, 639 P.2d 544 (1982) (rejecting the dual-purpose doctrine and requiring \u201conly that the business nature of an excursion be bona fide\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">{\u00b6 22} But this court implicitly rejected the dual-purpose doctrine by reversing a judgment of the Second District that relied, in part, on <em>Marks. Cardwell v. Indus. Comm., </em>155 Ohio St. 466, 99 N.E.2d 306 (1951). In <em>Cardwell, </em>the claimant was struck by a train in a vehicle while returning from running a personal errand with his wife. At the time of the accident, he was driving toward his place of employment but was planning to stop at his home along the way. <em>Id. </em>at 466-467. We held, unanimously:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-8\">There may have been a direct or proximate causal relationship between plaintiffs injuries and the trip made by the plaintiff and his wife for their personal purposes, but there certainly could be no such causal relationship between the plaintiffs employment and those injuries, at least until after his trip for personal purposes had ended. Such a proximate causal relationship is essential to justify the award of workmen\u2019s compensation to the plaintiff. <em>McNees v. Cincinnati Street Ry. Co., </em>152 Ohio St. 269, 89 N.E.2d 138 [1949].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b568-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 468.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">{\u00b6 23} After <em>Cardwell, </em>and in light of the mandate in <em>Fisher </em>that both the \u201cin the course of\u2019 and \u201carising out of\u2019 statutory elements must be met, Ohio\u2019s appellate courts properly have refused to recognize or create a blanket rule for employees traveling with both personal and employment purposes. Ohio courts have concluded that analyzing the facts and circumstances of these cases under the \u201cin the course of\u2019 and \u201carising out of\u2019 tests set forth in <em>Fisher </em>and its progeny is sufficient to determine coverage even for situations involving traveling employees and personal errands. <em>See Griffith v. Miamisburg, </em>10th Dist. Franklin No. 08AP-557, 2008-Ohio-6611, 2008 WL 5235168, \u00b6 13 (declining to recognize a special status for an employee on a business trip and analyzing eligibility for benefits under the <em>Fisher </em>standard); <em>Woodard, </em>2012-Ohio-4015, 2012 WL 3801327, \u00b6 20, citing Griffith; <em>see also Crockett, </em>2004-Ohio-3533, 2004 WL 1486082, at \u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">{\u00b6 24} VNA contends that the appellate court\u2019s decision in this case applies the previously unrecognized dual-intent doctrine in Ohio workers\u2019 compensation law. Friebel argues that VNA misreads the court of appeals\u2019 decision, which she contends properly applied the in-the-course-of and arising-out-of tests. She asserts that the dual-intent doctrine is irrelevant to the analysis. Despite Friebel\u2019s contention, we believe that the doctrine influenced the appellate court\u2019s analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">{\u00b6 25} In analyzing the \u201cin the course of\u2019 prong, the court of appeals noted that Friebel had \u201cdual intentions\u201d because she intended both to travel to her patient\u2019s home and to drop off her passengers at the mall. 2013-Ohio-1646, 991 N.E.2d 279, at \u00b6 21. The court of appeals found that \u201c[s]imply because [Friebel] dually intended to both travel to her patient\u2019s home and drop her passengers off at the mall when she left her house does not disqualify [her] from being in the course of employment since the accident occurred prior to [her] deviation from the route to the patient\u2019s house.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The dissenting opinion squarely took issue with the majority opinion\u2019s reliance on the dual intent of Friebel, noting the lack of case law supporting the concept of dual intent and the difficulty in determining \u201cwhat is in the mind of the employee.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 36 (Wise, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-8\">{If 26} The appellate court concluded that Friebel had not yet diverted from her employment purpose when she was injured because she was on the route to her patient\u2019s home. But an equally reasonable conclusion is that she had not yet begun her employment purpose because she had not yet dropped off her passengers. Thus, Friebel\u2019s dual purposes in traveling at the time of her injury shed little to no light on whether Friebel\u2019s actions, and the nature of her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>employment, demonstrate that her injury occurred in the course of her employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\">{\u00b6 27} Regardless of how the court of appeals construed Friebel\u2019s intentions, we decline to adopt the dual-intent, or dual-purpose, doctrine for analyzing a workers\u2019 compensation claim. And we make clear the correct standards for addressing similar claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">{\u00b6 28} The proper way to analyze workers\u2019 compensation claims, even for employees traveling for both personal and employment purposes, is to apply the \u201cin the course of\u2019 and \u201carising out of\u2019 tests described in <em>Fisher </em>and its progeny, including the totality-of-the-circumstances tests for causation described in <em>Lord </em>and <em>Ruckman. </em>Even when work creates the necessity for travel and the travel includes a personal purpose, workers\u2019 compensation benefits are available only for an injury that occurs in the course of and arising out of the employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">{\u00b6 29} And an employee\u2019s subjective intent regarding the purposes of her travel is not determinative as to whether the injury occurred in the course of and arose out of the employment. Almost all work requires travel, either as part of the employment duties or as part of a commute. And almost every occasion to travel for work may, at some point, involve both personal and employment purposes. Elevating an employee\u2019s subjective intent regarding her dual purposes above an objective review of that employee\u2019s actions and the nature of her employment would distract from the core analysis: (1) whether the time, place, and circumstances of the injury demonstrate that it occurred in the course of the employment and (2) whether under the totality of the circumstances, there is sufficient causal connection between the injury and the employment to establish that the injury arose out of the employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">{\u00b6 30} Looking for general guidance from cases with similar fact patterns can be useful. But given the fact-specific nature of the workers\u2019 compensation eligibility analysis and the impossibility of crafting a one-size-fits-all test, the dual-intent or dual-purpose doctrine does not have a place in analyzing workers\u2019 compensation claims in Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">\n<em>Propriety of Summary Judyment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b569-9\">{\u00b6 31} Turning to the second proposition, VNA contends that the court of appeals improperly \u201cde facto granted summary judgment, <em>sua sponte </em>on appeal, in favor of the non-moving claimant.\u201d In response, Friebel contends that VNA should not now be able to argue that summary judgment was improper, because it argued before the trial court that no genuine dispute of material fact exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-10\">{\u00b6 32} The court of appeals remanded the case for further proceedings without expressly granting summary judgment in Friebel\u2019s favor. But there would be little remaining for the fact-finder to do given the court of appeals\u2019 conclusion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>that, as a matter of law, Friebel\u2019s injury occurred in the course of and arising out of her employment. This conclusion is based in large part, however, on Friebel\u2019s dual intentions for travel at the time of the injury. We have now rejected the relevance of an employee\u2019s subjective intent regarding her dual purposes to the determination of workers\u2019 compensation coverage, and thus the fundamental predicate to the appellate court\u2019s decision is no longer extant.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">{\u00b6 33} Additionally, there remain questions of material fact in general dispute: Was Friebel a fixed-situs employee? Was she on a personal errand at the time of injury? Was she traveling her normal route to this patient\u2019s home? As is evident from the procedural ping-pong this case has endured, more than one reasonable inference can be drawn from the record. Because material facts are in genuine dispute, the matter may not be disposed of at the summary-judgment stage. Civ.R. 56; <em>see Jackson v. Kings Island, </em>58 Ohio St.2d 357, 360, 390 N.E.2d 810 (1979) (\u201cSummary judgment is not appropriate where the facts, which must be viewed in a light most favorable to the party opposing the motion * * * are subject to reasonable dispute\u201d). Thus, the merits of the claim must be decided at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">{\u00b6 34} We hold that the doctrine of dual intent, or dual purpose, is not recognized in Ohio for purposes of determining eligibility for workers\u2019 compensation benefits. We therefore reverse the decision of the Fifth District Court of Appeals and remand the cause to the Court of Common Pleas of Richland County for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b570-8\">Lanzinger, Kennedy, and French, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"Azg\">O\u2019Donnell, J., concurs in judgment only.</judges>\n<judges id=\"A8j\">Pfeifer and O\u2019Neill, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b565-11\">.

It is unclear whether this opinion affirms, reverses, or modifies the judgment of the court of appeals. Likewise, it does not involve a substantial constitutional question and it does not meet this court\u2019s jurisdictional requirement of a case \u201cof public or great general interest.\u201d Ohio Constitution, Article IV, Sections 2(B)(2)(a)(ii) and 2(B)(2)(e). The Fifth District did not rely on or apply the doctrine of dual intent in this case. The Fifth District decided the issues in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>case based on current statutes and binding precedent from this court, and I write to caution against the practice of announcing a new rule of law in a case that was decided on summary judgment, since it provides such a limited evidentiary record.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">{\u00b6 36} I agree with the majority that \u201c[t]he proper way to analyze workers\u2019 compensation claims, even for employees traveling for both personal and employment purposes, is to apply the \u2018in the course of and \u2018arising out of tests described in <em>Fisher [v. Mayfield, </em>49 Ohio St.3d 275, 277, 551 N.E.2d 1271 (1990)] and its progeny, including the totality-of-the-circumstances tests for causation described in <em>Lord [v. Daugherty, </em>66 Ohio St.2d 441, 423 N.E.2d 96, (1981)] and <em>Ruckman [v. Cubby Drilling, Inc., </em>81 Ohio St.3d 117, 120, 689 N.E.2d 917 (1998)]. Even when work creates a necessity for travel and the travel includes a personal purpose, workers\u2019 compensation benefits are available only for an injury that occurs in the course of and arising out of the employment.\u201d Majority opinion at \u00b6 28. That is precisely the analysis that the Fifth District performed in this case. The Fifth District determined that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to the Visiting Nurse Association of Mid-Ohio (\u201cVNA\u201d). The Fifth District also determined that under <em>Fisher, </em>Friebel was injured in the course of and arising out of her employment, as required by R.C. 4123.01(C). Thus, the court of appeals remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings. And now the majority mandates the same outcome as the court of appeals. Is that a reversal, affirmance, or modification? It is none of the above.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">{\u00b6 37} It is very clear that the Fifth District did not base its decision on the doctrine of dual intent, and it is wrong to suggest otherwise. Indeed, as the majority points out, the appellate opinion cites no precedent applying or explaining the doctrine of dual intent. Majority opinion at \u00b6 25, citing Judge Wise\u2019s dissenting opinion in the court of appeals. I would suggest that this case, an appeal from a summary judgment, simply does not have the sufficient evidentiary record to provide the foundation for a major pronouncement on a subject as complex as \u201cdual intent\u201d in the area of workers\u2019 compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">{\u00b6 38} The appellate opinion mentions dual intent only two times in the entire opinion, and neither time is the court applying the dual-intent doctrine. Both references are in \u00b6 21. The first reference appears as follows: \u201cThese facts present a unique situation in which [Friebel] had dual intentions when she left her home on the morning of Saturday, January 22, 2011. She intended to travel to her patient\u2019s home via a certain defined route. She also intended to drop her passengers off at the mall and return to the route to her patient\u2019s home.\u201d 2013-Ohio-1646, 991 N.E.2d 279, \u00b6 21 (5th Dist.). And then five sentences later, the opinion reads, \u201cSimply because [Friebel] dually intended to both travel to her patient\u2019s home and drop her passengers off at the mall when she left her house <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>does not disqualify [her] from being in the course of employment since the accident occurred prior to [her] deviation from the route to the patient\u2019s house.\u201d <em>Id. </em>These two oblique references in one paragraph of the entire 34-paragraph appellate opinion clearly demonstrate that the court of appeals was relying on established law rather than plowing new ground. Significantly, the appellate opinion, relying on established precedent from this court in the area of workers\u2019 compensation, devotes paragraphs 15 through 31 to explaining why the trial court erred as a matter of law when it granted summary judgment in favor of the employer. And in so doing, the court properly relied on applicable statutes and binding precedent from this court, including R.C. 4123.54(A), R.C. 4123.01(C), <em>Fisher, </em>49 Ohio St.3d 275, 551 N.E.2d 1271; <em>Lord, </em>66 Ohio St.2d 441, 423 N.E.2d 96; and <em>Ruckman, </em>81 Ohio St.3d 117, 689 N.E.2d 917.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AgN\">Plevin &amp; Gallucci, Frank Gallucci III, and Matthew P.

By definition, she travels to treat patients. Pursuant to her employer\u2019s policies, she was on the clock from the time she left her home on Saturday to visit her patient and was entitled to reimbursement for mileage for the whole journey, including the moment when her car was struck from the rear by another car. It is disingenuous at best to suggest that a worker is being paid to drive to a specific location to do her job, but under some theory of \u201cdual purpose\u201d she is not entitled to workers\u2019 compensation benefits for an injury that happens during the course of the journey.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">{\u00b6 40} The Fifth District got this case right when it reversed the summary judgment in favor of VNA and remanded this case to the trial court for further proceedings. Likewise, the majority\u2019s decision to remand the case to the trial court is correct. Everyone seems to agree that Friebel, at a minimum, deserves her day in court. However, the court here mischaracterizes the holding of the Fifth District, and to that I object. The Fifth District simply did not reverse the trial court\u2019s summary judgment based on the doctrine of dual intent. Thus, this case should be dismissed as having been improvidently accepted. It was already on course and heading in the right direction, our pronouncements to the contrary notwithstanding.</p>\n<judges id=\"b572-7\">Pfeifer, J., concurs in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
