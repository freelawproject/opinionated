Will, the Lorain County prosecuting attorney, has filed an affidavit with the clerk of this court under R.C. 2701.03 seeking to disqualify Judge James M. Burge from all matters in which Will or one of his assistant prosecutors appears as counsel of record. This would currently include 276 pending criminal cases and four civil matters. This is the sixth affidavit of disqualification that Will has filed or approved for filing against Judge Burge. One of Will\u2019s previous disqualification requests was granted; one was granted in part and denied in part; one was denied; and in the two other disqualification matters, Judge Burge voluntarily recused himself before the request was decided. <em>See </em>case Nos. 08-AP-057, 09-AP-106, 13-AP-027, 13-AP-065, and 14-AP-010. In his current 68-page affidavit, Will sets forth an assortment of allegations to support his position that Judge Burge is biased and prejudiced against the prosecutor\u2019s office and has violated various rules of the Code of Judicial Conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-13\">{\u00b6 2} Judge Burge has responded in writing to the allegations, denying any bias against Will and his assistant prosecutors. In addition to Will\u2019s initial affidavit and the judge\u2019s response, Will and Judge Burge have also submitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>supplemental filings, and several members of the Lorain County bar, including assistant prosecutors and local defense attorneys, have submitted affidavits as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">{\u00b6 3} For the reasons explained below, Will has not established that he is entitled to the extraordinary relief requested in his affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">Scope of affidavit-of-disqualification proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">{\u00b6 4} Much of Will\u2019s affidavit is devoted to proving that Judge Burge has violated the Code of Judicial Conduct. However, the issue before the chief justice in disqualification proceedings is a narrow one: \u201c[t]he constitutional and statutory responsibility of the Chief Justice in ruling on an affidavit of disqualification is limited to determining whether a judge in a pending case has a bias, prejudice, or other disqualifying interest that mandates the judge\u2019s disqualification from that case.\u201d <em>In re Disqualification of Kate, </em>88 Ohio St.3d 1208, 1209-1210, 723 N.E.2d 1098 (1999). <em>See also In re Disqualification of Sutula, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 1237, 2004-0hio-7351, 826 N.E.2d 297, \u00b6 5 (the chief justice\u2019s \u201creview of an affidavit of disqualification focuses not simply on the level of civility shown by judges and lawyers to each other, however, but rather more broadly on the judge\u2019s willingness and ability to serve fairly and impartially on a particular case\u201d). Thus, affidavit-of-disqualification proceedings are \u201cnot the appropriate mechanism for determining whether a judge has followed the Code of Judicial Conduct.\u201d <em>In re Disqualification of Capper, </em>134 Ohio St.3d 1271, 2012-Ohio-6287, 984 N.E.2d 1082, \u00b6 19. Judicial-misconduct complaints are heard by the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline and ultimately decided by the full court.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">{\u00b6 5} Moreover, many of Will\u2019s alleged judicial-rule violations are irrelevant to the issue whether Judge Burge is biased against the prosecutor\u2019s office. For example, Will claims that Judge Burge has used profanity during court proceedings; he has communicated with defendants using racially derogatory terms, such as \u201ccracker\u201d and \u201chomeboy\u201d; he has given preferential treatment to certain defense attorneys over other defense counsel; during the 2008 presidential election, he made sexually degrading comments about Hillary Clinton and racially harassed her supporters; he once threatened to \u201cchoke\u201d a defendant; he has made inappropriate comments about other Lorain County judges; he has misused his position as administrative judge by attempting to block vacation- and sick-time payouts to former employees of the court; he has retaliated against other public officials, including judges, for their refusal to hire his wife; and he has been known to improperly \u201cshake down\u201d attorneys for campaign contributions.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-9\">{\u00b6 6} Because these allegations of judicial misconduct do not support a conclusion that Judge Burge is biased against the prosecutor\u2019s office, they are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>outside the scope of this proceeding. Accordingly, only Will\u2019s specific bias allegations involving either himself or an assistant prosecutor will be addressed in this entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">Waiver</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">{\u00b6 7} An affidavit of disqualification must be filed \u201cas soon as possible after the incident giving rise to the claim of bias and prejudice occurred,\u201d and failure to do so may result in waiver of the objection, especially when \u201cthe facts underlying the objection have been known to the party for some time.\u201d <em>In re Disqualification of O\u2019Grady, </em>77 Ohio St.3d 1240, 1241, 674 N.E.2d 353 (1996). And in affidavit-of-disqualification proceedings, \u201cthe affiant has the burden to demonstrate that the affidavit is timely filed.\u201d <em>In re Disqualification of Carr, </em>138 Ohio St.3d 1237, 2013-Ohio-5927, 5 N.E.3d 1278, \u00b6 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">{\u00b6 8} Here, Will claims that Judge Burge has made various prejudicial comments to and about his assistant prosecutors. But many of the judge\u2019s alleged comments were made years ago, and Will offers no reason for presenting them now. For example, Will claims that in 2008, Judge Burge attempted to intimidate assistant prosecutor Richard Gronsky and called another former assistant prosecutor a liar. And Will claims that in 2010, Judge Burge made derogatory and inappropriate comments to assistant prosecutor Christopher Pierre about another assistant prosecutor and Pierre\u2019s supervisors. Will also asserts that during one criminal trial, assistant prosecutor Nick Hanek made an objection, to which Judge Burge responded by becoming visibly upset, slamming his fists on the bench, and scowling at Hanek. Yet Will offers no time frame for the judge\u2019s alleged prejudicial conduct towards Hanek. If Will believed that the judge\u2019s comments and conduct from years ago reflected bias against his office, he should have timely sought disqualification. Accordingly, Will waived the right to object to these alleged comments occurring years ago that Will failed to identify when he learned of the conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">Merits of the affidavit of disqualification</p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">\n<em>Applicable precedent and the standard for disqualification</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b197-9\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cThe statutory right to seek disqualification of a judge is an extraordinary remedy.\u201d <em>In re Disqualification of George, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 1241, 2003-Ohio-5489, 798 N.E.2d 23, \u00b6 5. The relief requested by Will, however, differs from most disqualification requests. Will\u2019s affidavit does not involve one underlying case; instead, he requests the disqualification of a duly elected judge from his <em>entire </em>criminal docket <em>and </em>those civil cases in which the prosecutor is required by law to represent a party. As precedent confirms, Will has a heavy burden to show he is entitled to such extraordinary relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>{\u00b6 10} Prosecutors have sought similar relief in at least two previous disqualification matters. In <em>In re Disqualification of Olivito, </em>74 Ohio St.3d 1261, 657 N.E.2d 1361 (1994), the Jefferson County prosecuting attorney alleged that Judge Dominick E. Olivito had made disparaging public comments about the prosecutor and his assistants, among other allegations. <em>Id. </em>at 1262. The chief justice first noted that the standard for disqualification must be necessarily high where the relief requested involves removal of the judge from his entire criminal docket. <em>Id. </em>at 1263. Notwithstanding Judge Olivito\u2019s \u201crather egregious\u201d public comments about the prosecutor, the chief justice denied the affidavit because Judge Olivito\u2019s feelings towards the prosecutor had not \u201cmanifested themselves in [the judge\u2019s] official duties to the extent that his disqualification from all criminal cases [was] warranted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>That is, despite Judge Olivito\u2019s \u201cunworthy\u201d language, the citizens of Jefferson County were not being deprived of their right to the fair and impartial administration of justice. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">{\u00b6 11} The chief justice denied a similar affidavit brought by the Adams County prosecuting attorney against Judge Elmer Spencer in <em>In re Disqualification of Spencer, </em>case No. 94-AP-179 (Dec. 23, 1994). That prosecutor complained about Judge Spencer\u2019s disparaging comments about the prosecutor\u2019s office and the judge\u2019s pervasive use of profanity, among other allegations. The chief justice again noted that the standard for a blanket order of disqualification from all criminal cases \u201cmust necessarily be high.\u201d On the merits, the chief justice found that Judge Spencer\u2019s public comments about the prosecutor and his assistants were \u201cregrettable\u201d but that the comments had not \u201cmaterially impacted] the fair administration of justice in Adams County.\u201d Similarly, Judge Spencer\u2019s pervasive use of profanity was \u201cpersonally distasteful\u201d to the chief justice, but there was insufficient evidence to conclude that the profanity affected \u201cthe judge\u2019s official duties or illustrate[d] bias or prejudice to the prosecutor\u2019s office that require[d] disqualification.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">{\u00b6 12} Consistent with <em>Olivito </em>and <em>Spencer, </em>the standard for disqualification of Judge Burge must necessarily be high. In order for Judge Burge to be removed from all cases involving the prosecutor\u2019s office, Will must demonstrate that Judge Burge has illustrated bias toward Will that manifests itself in the judge\u2019s official duties, thereby materially impacting the fair and impartial administration of justice in Lorain County. Will has not met his burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">\n<em>Alleged physically threatening behavior</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">{\u00b6 13} Will first claims that his employees \u201care in fear for their physical safety in Burge\u2019s courtroom.\u201d As support, Will recites two recent incidents between assistant prosecutor Jennifer Riedthaler and Judge Burge. First, Will claims that in March 2014, Judge Burge yelled at Riedthaler in his chambers for making <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>him \u201clook bad in the newspaper.\u201d According to Will, Judge Burge\u2019s \u201ctone was extremely angry,\u201d and the judge was gripping the handles of his chair \u201cas if to restrain himself.\u201d At one point, Judge Burge recalled a fact that he had apparently forgotten, and the judge \u201cproceeded to slam his head against the wall.\u201d Riedthaler believed that Judge Burge might throw his chair, but instead he \u201cangrily slammed the chair back down and walked into the hallway.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">{\u00b6 14} The second incident occurred in May 2014. Riedthaler was waiting in Judge Burge\u2019s courtroom at counsel table with a police detective. Before proceedings began, Judge Burge entered the room and announced that he felt \u201cshitty.\u201d After Riedthaler asked the judge what was wrong, he \u201cproceeded to walk over and position himself directly across the trial table\u201d from her. He then \u201cslammed his hands down on the table, shoulder-width apart, leaned over to APA Riedthaler and sternly said, \u201cYou will know in about two minutes. I don\u2019t want to yell at you in front of everyone.\u2019 \u201d Judge Burge then moved behind Riedthaler \u201cand began pacing back and forth.\u201d Riedthaler felt upset and frightened, but the judge never told her what was wrong. Instead, the judge indicated that he was \u201cover it,\u201d while grinning. Based on these two incidents, Will claims that Riedthaler \u201ccan no longer complete her functions in Judge Burge\u2019s courtroom,\u201d his \u201cemployees are in fear for their physical safety,\u201d and he is forced to staff Judge Burge\u2019s courtroom with two assistant prosecutors.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">{\u00b6 15} For his part, Judge Burge states that he was upset with Riedthaler during the May 2014 incident because she belatedly changed her position on an issue. However, Judge Burge denies threatening her or any other attorney. Jenifer Berki, a local defense attorney, also submitted an affidavit in support of Judge Burge. Berki claims that she was present for the recent allegation of Judge Burge threatening a prosecutor, and Berki avers that she did not feel that she was in a threatening environment at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">{\u00b6 16} A video of the May 2014 incident has been submitted. The video image is grainy and does not have sound, but it shows Judge Burge with his hands on counsel table leaning towards Riedthaler, who is seated at the table with other people. After about a minute, Judge Burge moved behind Riedthaler and appeared to lean against the railing between counsel table and the galley. The judge stayed there for about six minutes while Riedthaler appeared to converse with others in the courtroom, and at one point, Riedthaler moved to retrieve something from another area in the courtroom. Judge Burge then left the room. Contrary to Will\u2019s affidavit, the video does not show Judge Burge \u201cpac[ing] back and forth\u201d behind Riedthaler.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">{\u00b6 17} Riedthaler may have reasonably felt intimidated by some of Judge Burge\u2019s alleged actions, such as yelling at her, slamming his head against a wall, or slamming his chair down. But these two incidents alone do not necessarily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>show that Judge Burge has threatened Will\u2019s employees with physical harm. Nor do the two incidents illustrate a bias against the prosecutor\u2019s office. That is, Will has not established that Judge Burge intimidated Riedthaler <em>because </em>she worked for Will. The judge\u2019s conduct could have been caused by his intemperate nature. But the issue here is bias, and these two incidents alone do not prove that Judge Burge has a bias against the prosecutor\u2019s office warranting the extraordinary relief requested by Will in his affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">\n<em>Judge Burge\u2019s string of letters to Will</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">{\u00b6 18} Will next claims that after Judge Burge\u2019s \u201cthreatening actions\u201d toward Riedthaler, Will met with two other Lorain County common pleas court judges and requested that the general division judges remove Judge Burge as administrative judge and strip him of his criminal docket. Will claims that after Judge Burge learned of these meetings, the judge sent Will eight unsolicited letters over five business days. Will claims that these letters \u201creflect the depths of the hatred and animosity that Burge holds against\u201d Will and his office.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">{\u00b6 19} Judge Burge\u2019s letters cover a variety of topics, and they definitely demonstrate a deteriorated relationship between the two public officials, as both sides feel that the other has made threatening comments. Nonetheless, the letters do not prove that Judge Burge cannot be fair and impartial in any matter involving an assistant prosecutor, nor do the letters show that Judge Burge\u2019s differences with Will have affected the judge\u2019s official duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">\n<em>Sexual harassment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b200-8\">{\u00b6 20} Will claims that there are \u201cnumerous instances\u201d when his female employees have \u201cfelt that Judge Burge has committed sexual harassment.\u201d Will identifies two assistant prosecutors who have been subjected to this alleged harassment: Donna Freeman and Sherry Glass.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-9\">{\u00b6 21} As for Freeman, Will claims that Judge Burge expressed a \u201cprofessionally inappropriate interest\u201d in her, but Will did not further elaborate on this allegation. In response, Judge Burge claims that he recently offered Freeman the position as his bailiff, which she declined, but he is unaware of any other interest that he has shown in her that could have given rise to a belief that his concern for her was other than as a lawyer and new mother. Without more from Will, this vague allegation is insufficient to constitute bias or prejudice, let alone to prove that Judge Burge sexually harassed Freeman. <em>See, e.g., In re Disqualification of Walker, </em>36 Ohio St.3d 606, 522 N.E.2d 460 (1988) (\u201cvague, unsubstantiated allegations of the affidavit are insufficient on their face for a finding of bias or prejudice\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-10\">{\u00b6 22} As for assistant prosecutor Glass, Will claims that Glass has been subjected to \u201cmany embarrassing and demeaning comments about her appear<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>anee, as well as sexual references.\u201d For example, Will claims that Judge Burge has referred to Glass as a \u201cblond bombshell\u201d and a \u201clooker.\u201d In addition, Will claims that Judge Burge has mocked Glass by repeating what she says in a soft, exaggerated, feminine voice. Will further claims that during one September 2012 hearing, Glass asked to approach the bench with defense attorney Andy Robinson. Judge Burge commented on Glass\u2019s \u201clibrarian look\u201d and \u201cindicated that if she took off her glasses and let down her hair, Wow, what I would do to you.\u2019 \u201d Glass was flustered and embarrassed by these degrading comments, which were allegedly loud enough to be heard by the entire courtroom. Will claims that he was just made aware of the judge\u2019s inappropriate comments to Glass while preparing this affidavit of disqualification.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">{\u00b6 23} Several people have submitted affidavits regarding the September 2012 hearing. Glass submitted an affidavit attesting to the truth of Will\u2019s allegations. In addition, Amanda Thomas, a paralegal in Will\u2019s office, submitted an affidavit averring that she also heard the judge\u2019s inappropriate comments to Glass. However, Andrew Robinson, the defense attorney named in Will\u2019s affidavit as witnessing the inappropriate comments, submitted an affidavit averring that he had no recollection of the judge making such comments to Glass, and if Robinson had heard the comments, he claims that he would have remembered them. In addition, the court reporter for that hearing averred in her affidavit that she did not recall Judge Burge saying anything inappropriate to Glass.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">{\u00b6 24} For his part, Judge Burge acknowledges occasionally commenting on Glass\u2019s appearance and referring to her as a \u201cblond bombshell,\u201d which he claims was meant to characterize Glass as an aggressive prosecutor. Judge Burge does not recall making any statements similar to the remarks attributed to him at the September 2012 hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">{\u00b6 25} Judge Burge should not be commenting on the appearance of attorneys or referring to any individuals in his courtroom as \u201cblond bombshells.\u201d Such comments are undignified, unprofessional, and offensive. However, the record otherwise contains conflicting evidence regarding the September 2012 hearing. If Judge Burge made the alleged comments to Glass, his behavior is indefensible. Nevertheless, the issue here is not whether Judge Burge should be disciplined for making sexually inappropriate comments. The issue is whether Judge Burge has a bias against Will\u2019s office and whether that bias has materially affected the judge\u2019s official duties so that he must be removed from any case involving an assistant prosecutor. Based on this record, Will has not established that the judge\u2019s behavior toward Glass is a product of bias toward Will or that it reflects bias against Will and his office.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">\n<em>Disparaging comments</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b201-9\">{\u00b6 26} Will also claims that Judge Burge has made disparaging comments about Will and his management team. Many of these comments were allegedly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>made by Judge Burge to his former bailiff, who had a falling-out with Judge Burge and now works for Will. Vulgar and offensive language about other public officials \u2014 whether made on the bench, in public, or in chambers \u2014 is inconsistent with proper judicial demeanor and decorum. Given some of the comments attributed to Judge Burge in Will\u2019s affidavit, Will\u2019s concerns are understandable. However, as in <em>Olivito </em>and <em>Spencer, </em>regardless of whether the judge\u2019s comments reflect his personal feelings toward Will, there is insufficient evidence to conclude that the judge\u2019s feelings have \u201cmanifested themselves in his official duties to the extent that his disqualification from all criminal cases is warranted.\u201d <em>Olivito, </em>74 Ohio St.3d at 1263, 657 N.E.2d 1361.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">Professionalism</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">{\u00b6 27} Tension between a judge and a county prosecutor is bound to occur in our adversary system. Both sides seek to attain justice, but they do not always agree on what that means. However, principles of professionalism require judges and prosecutors to give proper respect to each other and to treat each other with the dignity and courtesy that each office deserves. The relationship between Will and Judge Burge has reached an unprofessional level and is less than the public deserves from these two veteran lawyers. Both parties must work to improve their professional relationship. The citizens of Lorain County deserve a civil working relationship between the prosecutor\u2019s office and the administrative judge of the common pleas court.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">{\u00b6 28} Finally, although Will\u2019s affidavit is being denied at this time, many of the allegations raised in his affidavit \u2014 especially those regarding Judge Burge\u2019s generally offensive language and conduct \u2014 are a cause for concern. Judge Burge is reminded of the \u201cJudicial Creed,\u201d which the Supreme Court of Ohio adopted in 2001 in recognition of the unique standards of professionalism required of judges. Three provisions of that creed bear repeating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-7\">I believe that my role requires scholarship, diligence, personal integrity and a dedication to the attainment of justice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-8\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-9\">I recognize that the dignity of my office requires the highest level of judicial demeanor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-10\">I will treat all persons, including litigants, lawyers, witnesses, jurors, judicial colleagues and court staff with dignity and courtesy and insist that others do likewise.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">{\u00b6 29} For the reasons stated above, the affidavit of disqualification is denied. The visiting-judge assignment relating to Will\u2019s affidavit of disqualification is withdrawn, and Judge Burge may commence hearing cases assigned to him in which the Lorain County Prosecuting Attorney\u2019s Office appears as counsel of record.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
