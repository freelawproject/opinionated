And more specifically, R.C. 2745.01(C) provides a rebuttable presumption that the employer acted with the intent to injure another if an injury occurs as a direct result of the deliberate removal of an equipment safety guard.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>{\u00b6 3} In this case, there is no evidence that Pro-Pak deliberately removed or disabled the safety bumper on the transfer car. Pixley therefore cannot avail himself of the statutory presumption, and he has not shown that Pro-Pak deliberately intended to injure him. Thus, no genuine issue of material fact exists on that issue, Pixley has failed to establish an intentional tort claim against his employer, and Pro-Pak is entitled to judgment on that claim as a matter of law. Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">Pro-Pak Industries</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">{\u00b6 4} Pro-Pak manufactures corrugated containers, boxes, and packaging materials. Within its facility are conveyor lines that carry materials on rollers throughout the plant and manually operated transfer cars that run on fixed pathways perpendicular to the conveyor lines in order to transfer materials to other areas of the facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">{\u00b6 5} The transfer cars can be operated from either end of the vehicle and are equipped with safety bumpers designed to automatically stop the car if compressed by an impact or if a switch fails for other reasons. The bumper has a pair of collapsible linkages, held open by springs, and when the bumper is compressed, the ferrous metal of the linkages is moved away from a proximity sensor, triggering a switch that breaks the circuit and cuts power to the transfer car. Once the safety bumper has collapsed, the car cannot operate until the bumper is reopened, the circuit is completed, and the system has been manually reset.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">Pixley\u2019s Injury</p>\n<p id=\"b342-8\">{\u00b6 6} On July 2, 2008, Pixley, a plant maintenance worker, decided to order a replacement for a malfunctioning conveyor-line motor, and he knelt by the conveyor line, with his right knee in the pathway where transfer cars run, while he wrote down the part number.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-9\">{\u00b6 7} At that time, Jonathan Dudzik started a transfer car, but because he operated it from the car\u2019s rear control station, the load obstructed his view and he could not see Pixley kneeling in the pathway. As the transfer car moved forward, it pinned Pixley\u2019s leg against the conveyor line, causing serious degloving injuries to his right leg from his knee to his ankle, damage to tendons and tissue, and fractures and chips to bones. The accident did not trigger the shutoff mechanism in the safety bumper, and Dudzik manually stopped the transfer car after he realized it had struck Pixley.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-10\">{\u00b6 8} That day, Pro-Pak tested that transfer car and determined that the safety bumper and other safety features functioned properly, and it therefore put the car back in service without repairing or adjusting it.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>{\u00b6 9} The next morning, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (\u201cOSHA\u201d) investigated the incident, photographing and video-recording the operation of the transfer car. In the OSHA investigator\u2019s presence, a Pro-Pak employee drove the transfer car, and when Frank Smith, Pro-Pak\u2019s plant superintendent, pushed the bumper on the transfer car, the bumper collapsed and the car stopped. Smith repeated this test multiple times at various points along the transfer car\u2019s pathway, and each time the safety mechanism functioned properly and stopped the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">Case History</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">{\u00b6 10} On June 23, 2010, Pixley brought an employer intentional tort claim against Pro-Pak, alleging that it had not adequately trained its transfer car operator and had deliberately bypassed the transfer car\u2019s safety bumper, causing the shut-off mechanism to fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">{\u00b6 11} Pro-Pak and Toledo L &amp; L Realty moved for summary judgment, urging that Pixley could not show that they had deliberately intended to injure him and asserting that he had placed himself in harm\u2019s way. Pixley opposed the motion, relying on affidavits and reports from two experts \u2014 R. Kevin Smith, P.E., and Gerald C. Rennell \u2014 who opined that the proximity sensor for the safety bumper had been deliberately bypassed or disabled. They based their opinions on their review of the video clips, which showed the safety bumper dragging on the surface of the aisle and partially collapsing without stopping the transfer car.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">{\u00b6 12} The trial court granted summary judgment, explaining that Pixley \u201cfailed to create a genuine issue of material fact that Pro-Pak had the \u2018specific intent\u2019 to injure him\u201d and \u201climiting the definition of \u2018equipment safety equipment\u2019 to items designed to protect the \u2018operator.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b343-9\">{\u00b6 13} Pixley appealed to the Sixth District Court of Appeals, which noted that the deliberate removal by an employer of an equipment safety guard creates a rebuttable presumption that the employer acted with the intent to injure another. Although it recognized that <em>Hewitt v. L.E. Myers Co., </em>134 Ohio St.3d 199, 2012-Ohio-5317, 981 N.E.2d 795, defined \u201cequipment safety guard\u201d to mean \u201c \u2018a device designed to shield the operator from exposure to or injury by a dangerous aspect of the equipment,\u2019 \u201d the appellate court determined that this definition should not be limited to protecting operators only. 2013-Ohio-1358, 988 N.E.2d 67 (6th Dist.), \u00b6 16, quoting <em>Hewitt </em>at \u00b6 26. Therefore, it \u201cread the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s definition of an \u2018equipment safety guard\u2019 as a \u2018device designed to shield the [employee] from exposure to or injury by a dangerous aspect of the equipment.\u2019 \u201d (Brackets and emphasis sic.) <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 21. Holding that a genuine issue of material fact existed regarding whether Pro-Pak had deliberately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>bypassed the safety bumper, the appellate court reversed and remanded the matter to the trial court. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 24, 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">{\u00b6 14} We accepted Pro-Pak\u2019s discretionary appeal on two propositions of law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-5\">(1) The <em>Hewitt </em>Court\u2019s Definition Of Equipment Safety Guard Is Limited To Protecting Operators Only.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-6\">(2) The \u201cDeliberate Removal\u201d Of An Equipment Safety Guard Occurs Only When There Is Evidence The Employer Made A Deliberate Decision To Lift, Push Aside, Take Off Or Otherwise Eliminate The Guard From The Machine.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">Claims before the Court</p>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">{\u00b6 15} The two propositions of law relate to whether the definition of an equipment safety guard is limited to devices designed to shield the operator of the machine from exposure to injury by a dangerous aspect of the equipment and whether the record established a genuine issue of material fact that an intentional tort occurred. We need address only the second issue presented, because it is dispositive of this appeal, and we therefore decline to address the other proposition of law presented to us.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-9\">{\u00b6 16} Pro-Pak urges that the safety bumper is not an equipment safety guard as defined by <em>Hewitt, </em>that the rebuttable presumption arises only if the operator of the equipment is injured by its deliberate removal, and that there is no evidence that Pro-Pak deliberately removed or disabled the safety bumper on the transfer car.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-10\">{\u00b6 17} Pixley contends that R.C. 2745.01(C) does not expressly differentiate between operators and nonoperators and that <em>Hewitt </em>did not require the court to decide whether the rebuttable presumption applied only to operators of the equipment. He further notes that OSHA regulations and Ohio Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation rules require equipment safety guards in order to protect all employees \u2014 not just operators \u2014 from foreseeable injuries and ProPak could be held vicariously liable if its employees deliberately disabled the safety bumper, even without any specific directive from management. And finally, he asserts that the transfer car could not operate with the safety bumper dragging on the floor unless the safety mechanism had been deliberately bypassed, and therefore summary judgment was inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-11\">Law and Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b344-12\">{\u00b6 18} As we explained in <em>Houdek v. ThyssenKrupp Materials N.A., Inc., </em>134 Ohio St.3d 491, 2012-Ohio-5685, 983 N.E.2d 1253, \u00b6 29, \u201cR.C. 2745.01 limits claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>against employers for intentional torts to circumstances demonstrating a deliberate intent to cause injury to an employee * * However, according to R.C. 2745.01(C), the deliberate removal by an employer of an equipment safety guard creates a rebuttable presumption that the removal was committed with intent to injure another if an injury or an occupational disease or condition occurs as a direct result.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">{\u00b6 19} And in <em>Hewitt, </em>we stated, \u201cthe \u2018deliberate removal\u2019 of an equipment safety guard occurs when an employer makes a deliberate decision to lift, push aside, take off, or otherwise eliminate that guard from the machine.\u201d <em>Hewitt, </em>134 Ohio St.3d 199, 2012-Ohio-5317, 981 N.E.2d 795, at \u00b6 30. <em>Accord, Houdek, </em>134 Ohio St.3d 491, 2012-Ohio-5685, 983 N.E.2d 1253, at \u00b6 27, quoting <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>1921 (1986) (\u201cThe plain meaning of the word \u2018remove\u2019 is \u2018to move by lifting, pushing aside, or taking away or off \u201d). Thus, the failure of an equipment safety guard is not sufficient by itself to raise the rebuttable presumption that the employer intended to injure another; rather, \u201cthe \u2018deliberate removal\u2019 referred to in R.C. 2745.01(C) may be described as a careful and thorough decision to get rid of or eliminate an equipment safety guard.\u201d <em>Hewitt </em>at \u00b6 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">{\u00b6 20} Pixley\u2019s experts formed their opinions that the safety bumper had been deliberately bypassed based upon the OSHA video footage, which shows the bumper dragging on the floor and partially collapsing without stopping the transfer car. However, the experts provided no basis for the assertion that the proximity switch should have been triggered in those circumstances, and Brian R. LaFreniere Sr., who worked for the company that installed the transfer car, stated that the safety bumpers could be pushed in at least three or four inches before breaking the circuit and stopping the car. Troy Jefferies, a maintenance manager at Pro-Pak, testified that in his experience the safety bumper still worked even if it dragged on the floor. And Scott Armey, Pro-Pak\u2019s human resources manager, stated that on the day of the accident and during the course of the OSHA investigation on the following day, he observed Pro-Pak employees test the safety bumper multiple times and each time they found that the act of compressing the bumper cut power to the transfer car and caused it to stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">{\u00b6 21} Even if there were a factual dispute concerning the operation of the safety bumper on the day of the accident, there is no evidence showing that ProPak deliberately removed it or otherwise caused it to fail. Pixley does not point to any physical or scientific evidence of tampering, nor has he presented any evidence that anyone at Pro-Pak made a decision to disable or eliminate the safety bumper. A maintenance technician explained that the only way to disable the safety bumper was by using a jumper wire to bypass the proximity switch, and there is no evidence that this ever occurred. To the contrary, Pro-Pak <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>maintenance employees were required to routinely inspect the safety bumper and make repairs if needed.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">{\u00b6 22} Because there is no evidence in this record that Pro-Pak deliberately removed or disabled the safety bumper on the transfer car or that it deliberately intended to cause injury, Pixley has failed to establish an intentional tort claim. Accordingly, the trial court correctly granted summary judgment on that issue in this case. The judgment of the appellate court to the contrary is therefore reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">{\u00b6 23} And because Pixley cannot establish the existence of an intentional tort in this case, we need not reach the issue whether the definition of an equipment safety guard is limited to devices shielding only operators from exposure to injury by a dangerous aspect of the equipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">{\u00b624} An employer intentional tort claim brought pursuant to R.C. 2745.01 requires proof of the employer\u2019s deliberate intent to cause injury to an employee, but there is a rebuttable presumption that the employer acted with the intent to injure another if an injury directly results from the deliberate removal of an equipment safety guard. In this case, however, Pixley failed to prove that ProPak deliberately removed or disabled the safety bumper on the transfer car that injured him. Because of that lack of evidence, the trial court properly entered a summary judgment in favor of Pro-Pak, and the judgment of the appellate court to the contrary is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">{\u00b6 25} Our determination that Pixley has failed to establish the elements of an intentional tort renders moot the question whether the definition of an equipment safety guard is limited to a device shielding the operator from injury or whether it encompasses all employees injured by its deliberate removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-9\">{\u00b6 26} Based on the foregoing, the judgment of the court of appeals is reversed, and the summary judgment entered by the trial court is reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-10\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b346-11\">Kennedy and French, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b346-12\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., concurs in judgment only.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b346-13\">Lanzinger, J., concurs in judgment only and joins the dissent of Pfeifer, J., only to the extent that it states that R.C. 2745.01(C) applies to both operators and nonoperators.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b346-14\">Pfeifer and O\u2019Neill, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b347-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>Pfeifer, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"APY\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">{\u00b6 27} As for the question of whether the appellant Pro-Pak Industries, Inc., deliberately removed the guard, I would affirm the judgment of the court of appeals that when viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the appellee, Phillip Pixley, as is appropriate at the summary-judgment stage, a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether Pro-Pak deliberately bypassed the safety bumper.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">{\u00b6 28} But this court did not accept jurisdiction over this case to answer the question of whether Pixley\u2019s claim could factually overcome summary judgment. That issue does not make this matter a \u201ccase[ ] of public or great general interest\u201d meriting this court\u2019s jurisdiction pursuant to its authority under Article TV, Section 2(B)(2)(e) of the Ohio Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">{\u00b6 29} What makes this case a Supreme Court case is the issue of whether R.C. 2745.01(C) applies to nonoperators who are injured because of an employer\u2019s removal of a safety guard. We should answer that question, and I would affirm the judgment of the appellate court.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">{\u00b6 30} The statute at issue in this case, R.C. 2745.01(C), reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-9\">Deliberate removal by an employer of an equipment safety guard or deliberate misrepresentation of a toxic or hazardous substance creates a rebuttable presumption that the removal or misrepresentation was committed with intent to injure another if an injury or an occupational disease or condition occurs as a direct result.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b347-10\">{\u00b6 31} The plain language of the statute demonstrates that the protections for workers contained in R.C. 2745.01(C) are in no way limited to the operator of a piece of machinery. Under the statute, there is a rebuttable presumption that the removal of a safety guard was committed with an intent to injure if <em>\u201can </em>injury * * * occurs as a direct result.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The statute does not differentiate between injuries to machinery operators and nonoperators; there is no limitation regarding to whom the injury must occur, other than the condition set forth in R.C. 2745.01(A) that the statute applies \u201c[i]n an action brought against an employer by an employee * * * for damages resulting from an intentional tort committed by the employer during the course of employment.\u201d Thus, R.C. 2745.01(C) applies to any employee who suffers an injury because of the employer\u2019s deliberate removal of a safety guard.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-11\">{\u00b6 32} I would therefore affirm the entirety of the appellate court\u2019s judgment, and I accordingly dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b347-12\">O\u2019Neill, J., concurs in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b348-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>O\u2019Neill, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Ai1\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">{\u00b6 33} This case comes to us for review of the granting of summary judgment. There are enough disputed facts in this case to write a law-school-journal article. While disposition of cases by summary judgment is essential to conserve the resources of litigants and the judiciary, it cannot be said strongly enough that when facts are in dispute, summary judgment is wholly inappropriate.. Civ.R. 56(C) provides that summary judgment \u201cshall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, written admissions, affidavits, transcripts of evidence, and written stipulations of fact * * * show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d The rule further specifies that summary judgment \u201cshall not be rendered unless it appears from the evidence * * * that reasonable minds can only come to but one conclusion and that conclusion is adverse to the party against whom the motion for summary judgment is made, that party being entitled to have the evidence or stipulation construed most strongly in the party\u2019s favor.\u201d Any appellate court\u2019s standard of review on summary judgment is de novo. <em>Grafton v. Ohio Edison Co., </em>77 Ohio St.3d 102, 105, 671 N.E.2d 241 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">{\u00b6 34} The appellate court correctly determined that summary judgment was inappropriate in this case. There is a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether Pro-Pak Industries, Inc., deliberately bypassed the safety bumper. What is not in dispute here is that the safety bumper did not save the injured worker\u2019s leg. It is clear that the machine hit the worker and kept on moving until it was <em>manually stopped </em>by the operator. In reversing the trial court\u2019s summary-judgment decision in favor of Pro-Pak, the Sixth District Court of Appeals writes, \u201cBased on the expert testimony, reasonable minds could conclude that the bumper compressed enough to shut off power to the transfer car, the power was not shut off, and the only way the bumper could have compressed as far as it did without shutting off the power was if the proximity switch had been deliberately bypassed.\u201d 2013-Ohio-1358, 988 N.E.2d 67, at \u00b6 24. Nothing more needs to be said at the summary-judgment stage. Everyone in the world is permitted to disagree with that expert \u2014 or agree with him. But clearly a room full of reasonable people could come to a whole lot of different opinions based upon that <em>competent evidence.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">{\u00b6 35} This case contains conflicting expert testimony and evidence regarding a material fact. Justice demands that such questions of fact be subjected to the crucible of inquiry. That should happen in a trial, as guaranteed by the Ohio Constitution, and should not be the work of this court. I am simply not convinced that, when construing the evidence in a light most favorable to Phillip Pixley, reasonable minds could come to but one conclusion. Indeed, the majority asserts that there is no genuine issue of material fact in this case after it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>identifies and resolves the factual question in favor of Pro-Pak. That exercise is an impermissible invasion of the jury box by this court. Pixley has established a genuine issue of material fact and deserves his day in court.
