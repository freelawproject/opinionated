D\u2019Angelo, counsel for defendant Michael Brelo, has filed an affidavit with the clerk of this court under R.C. 2701.03 seeking to disqualify Judge John P. O\u2019Donnell from presiding over any further proceedings in case No. CR-13-580457A, now pending in the Court of Common Pleas of Cuyahoga County.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-12\">{\u00b6 2} D\u2019Angelo alleges that on September 29, 2014, \u201cout of nowhere, and without consulting with counsel for the parties as to their availability,\u201d Judge O\u2019Donnell ordered that trial in the underlying matter would begin on October 22, 2014. D\u2019Angelo moved to continue the scheduled trial date, arguing that he and his co-counsel could not be adequately prepared by that date. According to D\u2019Angelo, Judge O\u2019Donnell denied his request for a continuance, which is \u201cinconsistent\u201d with the judge\u2019s practice of scheduling other cases on his docket. D\u2019Angelo states that Brelo\u2019s case has attracted unprecedented media attention and he believes that Judge O\u2019Donnell selected the trial date \u201cpurely for his own personal gain and personal interest in seeking election in his Ohio Supreme Court judicial race.\u201d According to D\u2019Angelo, the media coverage of the trial will provide Judge O\u2019Donnell with \u201cfree publicity, and free publication of his name and image\u201d for 13 days leading up to the election. D\u2019Angelo concludes that Judge O\u2019Donnell must be disqualified because he has demonstrated a personal interest in the trial and bias against Brelo by \u201cforcing his case to trial prematurely,\u201d solely to enhance his chances for election to the Supreme Court of Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-13\">{\u00b6 3} Judge O\u2019Donnell has responded to the affidavit in writing, denying any bias or prejudice against Brelo. The judge acknowledges that he set Brelo\u2019s case for trial without obtaining defense counsel\u2019s approval, contrary to his usual preference to have counsel agree on such matters. Judge O\u2019Donnell notes, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>however, that the attorneys could not agree to a trial date in this case. Judge O\u2019Donnell also explained his reasons for scheduling the trial on the date he selected, which are not election-related. Regardless, the judge concludes that because D\u2019Angelo filed the disqualification request, the \u201ctrial is not happening on October 22 \u2014 or any other time before November 4.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">{\u00b6 4} For the reasons explained below, no basis has been established to order the disqualification of Judge O\u2019Donnell.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">{\u00b6 5} First, D\u2019Angelo\u2019s allegations are moot. D\u2019Angelo\u2019s affidavit of disqualification hinges entirely on the allegation that Judge O\u2019Donnell had an \u201cinterest\u201d in holding trial within two weeks of the upcoming election. Judge O\u2019Donnell avers, however, that the trial will not take place before the November 4 election. Because the basis for D\u2019Angelo\u2019s allegations no longer exists, the affidavit is dismissed as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">{\u00b6 6} Second, even if the trial was to begin on October 22, D\u2019Angelo has not set forth sufficient grounds for disqualification. It is well established that a judge\u2019s scheduling of a trial is generally not evidence of bias or prejudice. <em>See In re Disqualification of Jones, </em>135 Ohio St.3d 1224, 2012-Ohio-6308, 985 N.E.2d 503, \u00b6 6 (\u201ca judge\u2019s scheduling of a trial is within her sound discretion and is not, by itself, evidence of bias or prejudice\u201d). Likewise, a trial court\u2019s decision on a motion to continue a trial is not grounds for disqualification. <em>In re Disqualification of Pontious, </em>94 Ohio St.3d 1235, 1236, 763 N.E.2d 603 (2001) (\u201cA judge\u2019s decision to grant or deny a party\u2019s request for a continuance is within the sound discretion of the judge and is not, by itself, evidence of bias or prejudice\u201d). Indeed, it is not the role of the chief justice in deciding an affidavit of disqualification to second-guess how a trial judge manages his or her docket. <em>In re Disqualification of Dezso, </em>134 Ohio St.3d 1223, 2011-Ohio-7081, 982 N.E.2d 714, \u00b6 12. Trial judges are entitled to exercise considerable discretion in the management of the cases on their dockets, and any abuse of that discretion can be remedied on appeal. <em>In re Disqualification of Sutula, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 1237, 2004-Ohio-7351, 826 N.E.2d 297, \u00b6 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">{\u00b6 7} Finally, D\u2019Angelo has not submitted the type of evidence .necessary to overcome the presumption of fairness and impartiality accorded to all judges. <em>In re Disqualification of George, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 1241, 2003-Ohio-5489, 798 N.E.2d 23, \u00b6 5 (\u201cA judge is presumed to follow the law and not to be biased, and the appearance of bias or prejudice must be compelling to overcome these presumptions\u201d). To support his disqualification request, D\u2019Angelo submitted the dockets of seven cases currently pending before Judge O\u2019Donnell in an attempt to establish that his scheduling of Brelo\u2019s trial was inconsistent with his typical trial-scheduling practice. According to D\u2019Angelo, the dockets reflect that the defendants in these cases were arraigned before Brelo was arraigned, but that Judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>O\u2019Donnell freely granted motions to continue and rescheduled the trials in these \u201cnon complex criminal cases\u201d to take place after Brelo\u2019s trial. D\u2019Angelo maintains that these facts, coupled with the judge\u2019s refusal to reschedule Brelo\u2019s trial, prove that Judge O\u2019Donnell has manipulated his docket solely to enhance his election prospects, to the detriment of Brelo.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">{\u00b6 8} The case dockets referred to by D\u2019Angelo, however, are not compelling evidence that Judge O\u2019Donnell is biased against Brelo or has a disqualifying interest in his trial. First, contrary to D\u2019Angelo\u2019s assertion, Judge O\u2019Donnell did not deny defense counsel\u2019s motion to continue the October 22 trial date. During a pretrial hearing in September, the judge deferred ruling on the motion, in part to give attorney D\u2019Angelo an opportunity to supplement his motion to continue the trial. The fact that the motion remains pending undercuts any notion that the judge has treated Brelo\u2019s case differently by not agreeing to continue the trial. Second, it is anything but self-evident that a sample of seven cases is representative of the judge\u2019s entire docket. Third, even if the scheduling of Brelo\u2019s trial was atypical when compared to the cases cited by D\u2019Angelo, it does not automatically follow that Judge O\u2019Donnell was motivated by personal gain and free publicity. Indeed, even a cursory review of the dockets uncovers facts that would distinguish the cases and justify the judge\u2019s decision to treat Brelo\u2019s case differently. For instance, D\u2019Angelo notes that Judge O\u2019Donnell scheduled and even rescheduled trial dates in these cases after conferring with counsel. The judge also discussed trial dates with counsel in Brelo\u2019s case on at least two occasions, but the attorneys here could not agree on a trial date.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">{\u00b6 9} In the end, D\u2019Angelo\u2019s affidavit rests entirely on speculation and alleges no factual basis that would require the removal of Judge O\u2019Donnell from Brelo\u2019s case. Allegations that are unsubstantiated \u2014 such as those alleged here \u2014 are insufficient to establish bias or prejudice. <em>See In re Disqualification of Flanagan, </em>127 Ohio St.3d 1236, 2009-Ohio-7199, 937 N.E.2d 1023, \u00b6 4; <em>In re Disqualification of Walker, </em>36 Ohio St.3d 606, 522 N.E.2d 460 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">{\u00b6 10} For the reasons stated above, the affidavit of disqualification is denied. The case may proceed before Judge O\u2019Donnell.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
