Because relators have not shown a clear entitlement to this extraordinary relief, we deny the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-11\">Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b508-12\">{\u00b6 2} Brown ran unsuccessfully to become the Democratic nominee for a seat on the Ashtabula County Common Pleas Court in the Democratic Party primary election held on May 6, 2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-13\">{\u00b6 3} On July 21, 2014, he filed nominating petitions to be a candidate for judge on the Ashtabula County Western Area Court in the November 4, 2014 general election. The Ashtabula County Board of Elections, relying solely on R.C. 3513.04, rejected Brown\u2019s petitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-14\">{\u00b6 4} Relators filed this action seeking a writ of mandamus to compel the board to certify his candidacy for the Western Area Court, asserting that R.C. 3513.04 is unconstitutional. We permitted Ohio Attorney General Michael DeWine to intervene as a respondent to defend the constitutionality of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-15\">Laches</p>\n<p id=\"b508-16\">{\u00b6 5} The attorney general asserts that relators unreasonably delayed in seeking relief and that this action is barred by the doctrine of laches. He suggests that Brown knew or should have known that he intended to challenge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>the constitutionality of R.C. 3513.04 on May 6, 2014, when he lost the primary election, and that relators failed to exercise the utmost diligence by not filing suit on July 24, 2014, when Brown first learned that the board would not certify his candidacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">{\u00b6 6} \u201cThe elements of laches are (1) unreasonable delay or lapse of time in asserting a right, (2) absence of an excuse for the delay, (3) knowledge, actual or constructive, of the injury or wrong, and (4) prejudice to the other party.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Polo v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Elections, 14, </em>Ohio St.3d 143, 145, 656 N.E.2d 1277 (1995). Laches may bar relief in an election-related matter if the person seeking relief fails to act with the \u201c \u2018utmost diligence.\u2019 \u201d <em>State ex rel. Monroe v. Mahoning Cty. Bd. of Elections, </em>137 Ohio St.3d 62, 2013-0hio-4490, 997 N.E.2d 524, \u00b6 30, quoting <em>State ex rel. Fuller v. Medina Cty. Bd. of Elections, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 221, 2002-Ohio-5922, 778 N.E.2d 37, \u00b6 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">{\u00b6 7} Relators could not have filed this action on May 6, 2014, when Brown lost the primary election, because relators had no claim for relief until the board of elections refused to place Brown\u2019s name on the ballot. <em>State ex rel. Linnabary v. Husted, </em>138 Ohio St.3d 535, 2014-Ohio-1417, 8 N.E.3d 940, \u00b6 16 (\u201cLinnabary did not have a claim to assert until [the secretary of state] removed his name from the ballot\u201d). Nor were respondents prejudiced by the failure to file suit on July 24, 2014, when Brown learned that the board would not certify his candidacy. Had relators filed suit at that time, this mandamus action would not have been docketed as an expedited election action, and the case might not have been decided before the September 20, 2014 deadline for sending absentee ballots to military and overseas voters, potentially placing the board in a significantly worse position.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">{\u00b6 8} We therefore reject the claim that laches bars this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">Mandamus</p>\n<p id=\"b509-9\">{\u00b6 9} The requirements for a writ of mandamus are well established: (1) the relator must demonstrate a clear legal right to relief, (2) the respondent must have a clear legal duty to perform the requested relief, and (3) there must be no adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law. <em>State ex rel. Harris v. Rhodes, </em>54 Ohio St.2d 41, 374 N.E.2d 641 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-10\">{\u00b6 10} And as we explained in <em>State ex rel. Pressley v. Indus. Comm., </em>11 Ohio St.2d 141, 228 N.E.2d 631 (1967),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-11\">\u201cthe issuance of a writ of mandamus rests, to a considerable extent at least, within the sound discretion of the court to which application for the writ is made. The writ is not demandable as a matter of right, or at least is not wholly a matter of right; nor will it issue unless the relator has a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>clear right to the relief sought, and makes a clear case for the issuance of the writ. The facts submitted and the proof produced must be plain, clear, and convincing before a court is justified in using the strong arm of the law by way of granting the writ.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b510-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 161, quoting 35 Ohio Jurisprudence 2d, Discretion as to Issuance, Generally, Section 37, at 285.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">{\u00b6 11} A writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy, exercised by this court with caution and issued only when the right is clear. <em>State ex rel. Taylor v. Glasser, </em>50 Ohio St.2d 165, 166, 364 N.E.2d 1 (1977); <em>State ex rel. Shafer v. Ohio Turnpike Comm., </em>159 Ohio St. 581, 589, 113 N.E.2d 14 (1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">{\u00b6 12} But relators are not only required to prove clear entitlement to relief, they must also overcome the presumption of constitutionality afforded to all acts of the General Assembly and demonstrate <em>beyond a reasonable doubt </em>that R.C. 3513.04 is unconstitutional. <em>State ex rel. Purdy v. Clermont Cty. Bd. of Elections, </em>77 Ohio St.3d 338, 345-346, 673 N.E.2d 1351 (1997); <em>State ex rel. Watson v. Hamilton Cty. Bd. of Elections, </em>88 Ohio St.3d 239, 245, 725 N.E.2d 255 (2000) (applying presumption of constitutionality to statute setting forth qualifications for office of sheriff).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">{\u00b6 13} The United States Constitution provides that states may prescribe \u201c[t]he Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives,\u201d Article I, Section 4, cl. 1, and the Supreme Court has recognized that states retain the power to regulate their own elections. <em>Burdick v. Takushi, </em>504 U.S. 428, 433, 112 S.Ct. 2059, 119 L.Ed.2d 245 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-9\">{\u00b6 14} To assess the constitutionality of a state election law, the court must first \u201cconsider the character and magnitude of\u2019 the claimant\u2019s alleged injury. <em>Anderson v. Celebrezze, </em>460 U.S. 780, 789, 103 S.Ct. 1564, 75 L.Ed.2d 547 (1983). If the regulation severely restricts voting rights, then strict scrutiny applies and the law must be narrowly tailored to advance a compelling state interest. <em>Burdick </em>at 434. We have explained that \u201ca law severely burdens voting rights if it discriminates based on political content instead of neutral factors or if there are few alternative means of access to the ballot.\u201d <em>Watson </em>at 243. But \u201cnot every statutory restriction limiting the field of candidates need advance a compelling state interest,\u201d <em>id., </em>and if the regulation is minimally burdensome and nondiscriminatory, then \u201c \u2018the State\u2019s important regulatory interests are generally sufficient to justify\u2019 the restrictions,\u201d <em>Burdick </em>at 434, quoting <em>Anderson </em>at 788.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-10\">{\u00b6 15} Notably, we applied these standards to a prior version of R.C. 3513.04 in <em>Purdy </em>and upheld the statute against constitutional challenge. At that time, paragraph three of the statute stated: \u201cNo person who seeks party nomination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>for an office or position at a primary election * * * shall be permitted to become a candidate by nominating petition * * * at the following general election for any office by nominating petition or by declaration of intent to be a write-in candidate.\u201d Sub.S.B. No. 261, 146 Ohio Laws, Part VI, 10605, 10608. We concluded that this statute imposed only a \u201cvery limited\u201d and slight burden on potential candidates, <em>Purdy, </em>77 Ohio St.3d at 344, 673 N.E.2d 1351, \u201c[did] not unreasonably interfere with the right of voters to have candidates of their choice placed on the ballot,\u201d <em>id., </em>and was nondiscriminatory, <em>id. </em>at 343, and we explained that \u201cOhio clearly has a legitimate interest in preventing potential conflicts among party members, an interest in preventing the possibility of voter confusion, and an interest in preventing candidacies that may conceivably be prompted by short-range goals,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 346.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">{\u00b6 16} Following our decision in <em>Purdy, </em>the General Assembly enacted a number of amendments to R.C. 3513.04, and the statute now states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-6\">No person who seeks party nomination for an office or position at a primary election * * * shall be permitted to become a candidate by nominating petition * * * at the following general election for any office <em>other than the office of member of the state board of education, office of member of a city, local, or exempted village board of education, office of member of a governing board of an educational service center, or office of township trustee.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">(Emphasis added for new material since 1997.)</p>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">{\u00b6 17} Relators maintain that these amendments cannot survive strict scrutiny, because these provisions arbitrarily and invidiously discriminate against Brown and similarly situated individuals and severely burden fundamental rights to associate and vote by limiting the field of candidates available to voters. And, they contend, the restrictions imposed by the statute are purposeless; relators claim that any state interest in regulating partisan elections does not apply to candidates for nonpartisan office, that Brown\u2019s candidacy was not short-sighted, and that there is no chance of voter confusion or intraparty conflict in these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-9\">{\u00b6 18} The attorney general responds that our decision in <em>Purdy </em>provides the rule of decision in this case, that the rational-basis test should guide our analysis, and that the legislature could reasonably conclude that \u201cthe risks associated with second-chance/sore-loser candidacies (and the overall effect on Ohio\u2019s electoral integrity) are lessened within the context of educational and/or highly localized positions\u201d and that \u201cthere was more need to encourage and incentivize candidacy for such positions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>{\u00b6 19} It is not clear on this record that the amendments enacted in 1998 are unconstitutional solely because the statute now permits unsuccessful primary candidates the opportunity to file nominating petitions for some nonpartisan offices \u2014 member of the state board of education, member of a city, local, or exempted village board of education, member of a governing board of an educational service center, or township trustee. These amendments <em>increase </em>voter access and <em>lessen </em>the burdens on candidates who have run in a primary and who have elected to refile for the above designated offices. <em>See McDonald v. Bd. of Election Commrs. of Chicago, </em>394 U.S. 802, 811, 89 S.Ct. 1404, 22 L.Ed.2d 739 (1969) (Illinois statute allowing some but not all inmates to receive absentee ballots was constitutional, and the fact \u201c[t]hat Illinois has not gone still further, as perhaps it might, should not render void its remedial legislation\u201d). And the statute remains nondiscriminatory; although these amendments may treat offices differently, all candidates are treated equally. Thus, any burden on voting rights remains, as the court in <em>Purdy </em>put it, \u201cslight\u201d and \u201cvery limited,\u201d and the state interest required to justify it is correspondingly small.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">{\u00b6 20} There may be legitimate reasons that motivated the General Assembly to designate certain offices for different treatment, and we lack the benefit of a sufficiently developed record in this expedited election matter to definitively state that the legislature lacked any basis for its actions. For example, in this instance, having lost a primary election for common pleas court judge, relator Brown seeks the opportunity to run for a different judicial office at the general election held in the same year, which may be confusing to voters and provide an advantage over other judicial candidates; but because there are no primary elections for state board of education, there is no possibility of voter confusion in that instance. <em>See </em>R.C. 3513.259 (\u201cNominations of candidates for the office of member of the state board of education shall be made only by nominating petition\u201d). These are policy considerations that belong with the General Assembly, not the judiciary.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">{\u00b6 21} It is not sufficient for relators to cast doubt on the constitutionality of this statute, nor is it the attorney general\u2019s burden to prove the statute constitutional; rather, relators must show beyond a reasonable doubt that R.C. 3513.04 is unconstitutional. This is so, because \u201c[t]he ability to invalidate legislation is a power to be exercised only with great caution and in the clearest of cases.\u201d <em>Yajnik v. Akron Dept. of Health, Hous. Div., </em>101 Ohio St.3d 106, 2004-Ohio-357, 802 N.E.2d 632, \u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">{\u00b6 22} The opinion concurring in the judgment misses the point. Relators seek extraordinary relief in this court and can obtain it only if they demonstrate clear entitlement to the writ. The standards articulated by the Supreme Court in <em>Anderson </em>and <em>Burdick </em>that apply in civil litigation challenging the constitutionali<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>ty of ballot restrictions inform our analysis, but those cases are not writ actions and do not involve the unique burdens that control the adjudication of original actions in this court. Otherwise, this case would present nothing more than an action seeking a declaratory judgment that the statute is unconstitutional, and we lack original jurisdiction to grant a declaratory judgment. <em>State ex rel. Ministerial Day Care Assn. v. Zelman, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 347, 2003-Ohio-6447, 800 N.E.2d 21, \u00b6 22. Rather, the function of mandamus is to compel the performance of a present existing duty. <em>State ex rel. Willis v. Sheboy, </em>6 Ohio St.3d 167, 451 N.E.2d 1200 (1983), paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">{\u00b6 23} The opinion concurring in the judgment conflates the legal standards at issue here. Although it purports to apply the principles of the ballot-access cases in determining that R.C. 3513.04 is unconstitutional, it points to nothing in the post-1998 amendments to the statute that burdens the right to vote or access to the ballot. And it presumably agrees that any burden on Brown\u2019s candidacy is outweighed by the state\u2019s legitimate interests, because it would uphold the ballot restrictions' if severed from the posW1998 amendments. Rather, the opinion concurring in judgment purports to resolve an equal protection claim by severing language from the statute, and equal protection claims are subject to rational-basis review because \u201cthere is no fundamental right to run for public office.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Keefe v. Eyrich, 22 </em>Ohio St.3d 164, 165, 489 N.E.2d 259 (1986). This is the reason why relators have the burden to do more than simply cast doubt on the constitutionality of the statute to succeed.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">{\u00b6 24} For these reasons, relators have not overcome the presumption of constitutionality, nor have they demonstrated that R.C. 3513.04 is unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt. Hence, they have not shown a clear entitlement to extraordinary relief. No writ will issue in such doubtful circumstances. Accordingly, we deny the requested writ of mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">Writ denied.</p>\n<judges id=\"b513-8\">O\u2019Donnell, Kennedy, and French, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b513-9\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Lanzinger, J., concur in judgment only.</judges>\n<judges id=\"AR4\">Pfeifer, J., dissents.</judges>\n<p id=\"b513-10\">O\u2019Neill, J., not participating.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b508-17\">.

I therefore write separately to clarify the constitutional issues at play in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">{\u00b6 26} We first considered the constitutionality of R.C. 3513.04 in <em>State ex rel. Purdy v. Clermont Cty. Bd. of Elections, </em>77 Ohio St.3d 338, 673 N.E.2d 1351 (1997). As written at the time, R.C. 3513.04 operated to prevent unsuccessful primary candidates from seeking election to a different office in the same election cycle, with no exceptions. The relators in <em>Purdy </em>challenged the statute as violating ballot-access rights protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. <em>Id. </em>at 341.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">{\u00b6 27} To decide the case, we applied the \u201cmodified balancing test\u201d adopted by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Anderson v. Celebrezze, </em>460 U.S. 780, 789, 103 S.Ct. 1564, 75 L.Ed.2d 547 (1983), and <em>Burdick v. Takushi, </em>504 U.S. 428, 434, 112 S.Ct. 2059, 119 L.Ed.2d 245 (1992). <em>Purdy </em>at 342-343. We held that R.C. 3513.04 was constitutional because it imposed only a \u201cslight\u201d burden on First and Fourteenth Amendment rights, which was outweighed by legitimate state interests promoted by the law. <em>Id. </em>at 346.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">{\u00b6 28} The constitutionality of R.C. 3513.04 is before us again because the statute was modified in 1998 and subsequent years. The statute previously allowed no exceptions; the amended law now permits \u201csore-loser\u201d candidates to launch second-chance campaigns for some, but not all, nonpartisan offices.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-8\">No person who seeks party nomination for an office or position at a primary election * * * shall be permitted to become a candidate by nominating petition * * * at the following general election for any office <em>other than the office of member of the state board of education, office of member of a city, local, or exempted village board of education, office of member of a governing board of an educational service center, or office of township trustee.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b514-9\">(Emphasis added for new material since 1997.)</p>\n<p id=\"b514-10\">{\u00b6 29} The addition of a limited pool of exempt offices to R.C. 3513.04 raises two distinct constitutional questions, which the parties\u2019 briefs unfortunately conflate. The obvious question is whether the exceptions create an equal-protection problem, an issue that was not before the <em>Purdy </em>court. But this case also requires us to revisit the question whether the statute, as amended, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>continues to promote state interests sufficient to outweigh the burden on relators\u2019 First and Fourteenth Amendment ballot-access rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\"><em>First Amendment rights: </em>Anderson/Burdick <em>balancing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">{\u00b6 30} Ballot-access restrictions place burdens on two different, but overlapping, rights enjoyed by electors such as relators Clifford Henry and Michael Vandervort: \u201cthe right of individuals to associate for the advancement of political beliefs, and the right of qualified voters, regardless of their political persuasion, to cast their votes effectively.\u201d <em>Williams v. Rhodes, </em>393 U.S. 23, 30, 89 S.Ct. 5, 21 L.Ed.2d 24 (1968). These rights are protected against state encroachment by the First and Fourteenth Amendments. <em>Id. </em>at 30-31. The First Amendment also protects the parallel rights of candidates, such as relator Thomas Brown, affected by ballot-access regulations. \u201c[BJallot access eases based on First Amendment grounds have rarely distinguished between the rights of candidates and the rights of voters.\u201d <em>Cook v. Gralike, </em>531 U.S. 510, 531, 121 S.Ct. 1029, 149 L.Ed.2d 44 (2001) (Rehnquist, C.J., concurring in judgment), citing <em>Bullock v. Carter, </em>405 U.S. 134, 143, 92 S.Ct. 849, 31 L.Ed.2d 92 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">{\u00b6 31} To assess the constitutionality of a ballot-access law under the First Amendment, a reviewing court engages in the balancing inquiry described in <em>Anderson </em>and <em>Burdick. Anderson/Burdick </em>balancing is a \u201ctwo-step\u201d inquiry. <em>See Navarro v. Neal, </em>716 F.3d 425, 430 (7th Cir.2013); <em>Coalition for Free &amp; Open Elections, Prohibition Party v. McElderry, </em>48 F.3d 493, 497 (10th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">{\u00b6 32} First, the court must \u201cconsider the character and magnitude of the asserted injury to the rights protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments that the plaintiff seeks to vindicate.\u201d <em>Anderson, </em>460 U.S. at 789, 103 S.Ct. 1564, 75 L.Ed.2d 547. Second, the court must weigh the character and magnitude of that constitutional injury against \u201c \u2018the precise interests put forward by the State as justifications for the burden imposed by its rule.\u2019 \u201d <em>Burdick, </em>504 U.S. at 434, 112 S.Ct. 2059, 119 L.Ed.2d 245, quoting <em>Anderson </em>at 789.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">{\u00b6 33} The magnitude of the burden determines the appropriate level of scrutiny the statute will receive. <em>Purdy, </em>77 Ohio St.3d at 343, 673 N.E.2d 1351; <em>Burdick </em>at 434. If an election regulation severely burdens the plaintiffs rights, then the statute is subject to strict scrutiny, which is to say the regulation must be narrowly drawn to advance a compelling state interest. <em>Burdick </em>at 434. In all other cases, where the ballot-access regulation imposes some burden on First Amendment rights, however minimal, the court must weigh those burdens against the interest asserted by the state. \u201cHowever slight [the] burden [that a state law imposes] may appear, * * * it must be justified by relevant and legitimate state interests \u2018sufficiently weighty to justify the limitation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Crawford v. Marion Cty. Election Bd., </em>553 U.S. 181, 191, 128 S.Ct. 1610, 170 L.Ed.2d 574 (2008) (lead <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>opinion), quoting <em>Norman v. Reed, </em>502 U.S. 279, 288-289, 112 S.Ct. 698, 116 L.Ed.2d 711 (1992); <em>see also Crawford </em>at 211 (Souter, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\"><em>Equal protection: </em>Anderson/Burdick <em>balancing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">{\u00b6 34} Equal protection applies not just to the initial allocation of the franchise, but also to the manner of its exercise. <em>Bush v. Gore, </em>531 U.S. 98, 104, 121 S.Ct. 525, 148 L.Ed.2d 388 (2000). The court made clear in <em>Crawford </em>that equal-protection election challenges are subject to the same <em>Anderson/Burdick </em>analysis as are First Amendment ballot-access challenges. <em>See Northeast Ohio Coalition for the Homeless v. Husted, </em>696 F.3d 580, 592 (6th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">{\u00b6 35} The state argues that rational-basis review should apply because the classifications at issue are neutral. The state\u2019s position misconstrues the law. Rational-basis review applies to laws that draw nondiscriminatory classifications <em>and impose no burden on the right to vote. McDonald v. Bd. of Election Commrs. of Chicago, </em>394 U.S. 802, 807-809, 89 S.Ct. 1404, 22 L.Ed.2d 739 (1969). But where a plaintiff alleges that the state has burdened voting rights through disparate treatment, the <em>Anderson/Burdick </em>balancing test is applicable. <em>Obama for Am. v. Husted, </em>697 F.3d 423, 429 (6th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">\n<em>The plurality erroneously utilizes rational-basis scrutiny</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b516-9\">{\u00b6 36} Despite paying lip service to the <em>Anderson/Burdick </em>test, the plurality proceeds to analyze the statute under a conventional \u201crational basis\u201d standard that affords \u201csubstantial deference\u201d to the legislature. <em>State v. Williams, </em>88 Ohio St.3d 513, 531, 728 N.E.2d 342 (2000). Consistent with this standard, the plurality opinion rejects relators\u2019 challenge because the record will not permit the court \u201cto definitively state that the legislature lacked any basis for its actions.\u201d Plurality opinion at \u00b6 20.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b516-10\">{If 37} However, rational-basis review is not appropriate in ballot-access cases. In <em>Crawford, </em>the United States Supreme Court rejected the suggestion that <em>Burdick </em>allows for any \u201cdeferential\u201d standard for a state\u2019s important regulatory interests. 553 U.S. at 190, 128 S.Ct. 1610, 170 L.Ed.2d 574, fn. 8. Thus, traditional rational-basis review does not apply to the review of ballot-access statutes. <em>Price v. New York State Bd of Elections, </em>540 F.3d 101, 108-109 (2d Cir.2008); <em>Am. Civ. Liberties Union of New Mexico v. Santillanes, </em>546 F.3d 1313, 1321-1322 (10th Cir.2008); <em>Rogers v. Corbett, </em>468 F.3d 188, 194 (3d Cir.2006); <em>see also Credico v. New York State Bd. of Elections, </em>E.D.N.Y. No. 10 CV 4555, 2013 WL 3990784 (Aug. 5, 2013), *20 (\u201cThe Court should not apply rational basis review to a challenged law that burdens First Amendment rights <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>* * *\u00bb). <em>Green Party of Arkansas v. Daniels, </em>733 F.Supp.2d 1055, 1062 (E.D.Ark.2010) (review of a ballot-access restriction that imposes minimal burdens \u201cis not the rational-basis inquiry advocated by the State\u201d); <em>Am. Assn, of People with Disabilities v. Herrera, </em>580 F.Supp.2d 1195, 1216 (D.N.M.2008) (\u201ca district court, to be faithful to the Supreme Court\u2019s language and standard in <em>Anderson v. Celebrezze, </em>must be careful not to transform the <em>Anderson </em>test into a de facto form of strict scrutiny or rational basis test, but must carefully and faithfully apply the two stages that the <em>Anderson </em>test requires\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">{\u00b6 38} The more serious legal error in the plurality opinion lies in its misallocation of the burden of proof. Traditional rational-basis review imposes no burden upon the state to prove that the legislation is justified. <em>Williams, </em>at 531. Rather, the burden falls upon the party challenging the legislation \u201c \u2018to negative every conceivable basis which might support it.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Thompson, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 264, 2002-Ohio-2124, 767 N.E.2d 251, \u00b6 27, quoting <em>Madden v. Kentucky, </em>309 U.S. 83, 88, 60 S.Ct. 406, 84 L.Ed. 590 (1940). The plurality opinion reflects this standard. Plurality opinion at \u00b6 21 (\u201cIt is not sufficient for relators to cast doubt on the constitutionality of this statute, <em>nor is it the Attorney General\u2019s burden to prove the statute </em>constitutional; rather, relators must show beyond a reasonable doubt that R.C. 3513.04 is unconstitutional\u201d [emphasis added]).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">{\u00b6 39} This is simply an incorrect statement of law. <em>Anderson </em>instructs courts to weigh \u201cthe precise interests <em>put forward by the State </em>as justifications for the burden imposed by its rule.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Anderson, </em>460 U.S. at 789, 103 S.Ct. 1564, 75 L.Ed.2d 547. \u201cThe State need not provide empirical evidence justifying its interest; however, the State cannot rely on hollow or contrived arguments as justifications.\u201d <em>Trudell v. State, </em>193 Vt. 515, 2013 VT 18, 71 A.3d 1235, at \u00b6 21; <em>Price v. New York State Bd. of Elections, </em>540 F.3d at 110. Thus, the state plainly has a burden to proffer justifications for the law, along with an explanation of how the law satisfies that state interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">{\u00b6 40} The plurality\u2019s attempt to distinguish this case based on the specific relief sought \u2014 mandamus\u2014ignores 20 years of jurisprudence from this court. In <em>Purdy, </em>we discussed the fact that the relief sought was closer in nature to declaratory judgment and prospective injunction, because in order to establish his \u201cclear right to relief,\u201d the relator first needed a declaration that the statute was unconstitutional. <em>Purdy, </em>77 Ohio St.3d at 341-342, 673 N.E.2d 1351. However, we held that it was permissible in limited circumstances, especially in elections matters, to seek mandamus instead of declaratory judgment. <em>Id. </em>at 341 (\u201ccertain election matters may present extraordinary circumstances. In this regard, declaratory judgment might not provide an adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>{\u00b6 41} The plurality opinion cites absolutely no authority for its proposition that because this case arises in mandamus, relators must satisfy a greater burden to secure ballot access. And in fact, there is no such authority. Relators established that the statute burdened their constitutional rights and that the state could present no justification for that burden. Based on <em>Crawford, Bur-dick, Anderson, </em>and our own decisions, by prevailing on these points, relators established a clear legal right to relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">{\u00b6 42} At the heart of the plurality opinion lies a great mystery: what greater showing could relators muster to overcome the plurality\u2019s agnosticism?</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">{\u00b6 43} Of greater concern is the plurality\u2019s complete lack of comprehension of what constitutes a ballot-access law. The plurality opinion clings to the fiction that it is only the pre-1998 statute that deals with ballot access, whereas \u201cnothing in the posN1998 amendments to the statute * * * burden[s] the right to vote or access to the ballot,\u201d as if the two functioned independently.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">{\u00b6 44} This argument is a celebration of form over substance. Apparently, if the statute were drafted to say that \u201cno one is subject to the sore-loser restriction except county court candidates,\u201d the plurality would recognize the change as a ballot-access restriction. But because the law is written inversely, to say who <em>may </em>run a second-chance campaign instead of who may <em>not, </em>it ceases to be a ballot-access limitation, even though it achieves exactly the same result.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">{\u00b6 45} Moreover, the plurality\u2019s determination to divorce this case from its election-law roots, so as to employ a conventional \u201crational-basis\u201d analysis, ignores the fact that <em>Crawford </em>occupies the field when it comes to elections laws. \u201cTo evaluate a law respecting the right to vote \u2014 whether it governs voter qualifications, candidate selection, or the voting <em>process </em>\u2014 we use the approach set out in <em>Burdick </em>* * *.\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>553 U.S. at 204, 128 S.Ct. 1610, 170 L.Ed.2d 574 (Scalia, J., concurring). To pretend that this case is something other than an elections case governed by <em>Anderson/Burdick </em>is to deny the obvious.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-9\">\n<em>Legal analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b518-10\">{\u00b6 46} The state has made no effort to satisfy its burden to put forward justifications for the burdens imposed by amended R.C. 3513.04. Instead, the state offers mere speculation. \u201c[T]he legislature could rationally have decided that the risks associated with second-chance/sore-loser candidacies (and the overall effect on Ohio\u2019s electoral integrity) are lessened within the context of educational and/or highly localized positions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b518-11\">{\u00b6 47} The notion that boards of education are somehow immune from intraparty conflict is unsupported by evidence, experience, or common sense. To the contrary, boards of education, like every other elected office, are susceptible to the same partisan and political maneuvering that the \u201csore-loser\u201d statute is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>designed to prevent. And \u201chighly localized position\u201d is an apt description of the judicial seat for the western division of Ashtabula County.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">{\u00b6 48} Alternatively, the attorney general offers an argument in defense of the statute that is even more speculative and unconvincing: \u201cthe legislature could also reasonably think that there was more need to encourage and incentivize candidacy for such positions.\u201d A hypothetical desire to \u201cincentivize\u201d people to serve on school boards should not outweigh Brown\u2019s First Amendment rights, at least not in the absence of <em>any </em>evidence that R.C. 3513.04 was causing an actual shortage of candidates for these positions.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">{\u00b6 49} The undeniable fact is that the decision to exempt some, but not all, nonpartisan offices from the \u201csore-loser\u201d statute was arbitrary. There appears to be no articulable reason why these offices were selected or why others were omitted. And when it comes to election laws, it is precisely this sort of arbitrary regulation that the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution forbids.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">{\u00b6 50} In addition, the statute, as amended, no longer justifies the burden on relators\u2019 First Amendment rights. The plurality suggests that the amendments have lessened the burden, insofar as more offices are now available to second-chance candidates. But as applied to Brown, as a candidate for this particular judicial office, the burden remains the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">{\u00b6 51} Moreover, even if the \u201cslight\u201d burden has now become \u201cslighter,\u201d it must still be outweighed by some legitimate state interest that the law furthers. The interests that were deemed adequate in <em>Purdy </em>\u2014 avoiding confusion caused by second-chance candidates \u2014 no longer has force when second-chance candidates are able to run for some, though not all, offices in the general election.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-9\">{\u00b6 52} The plurality speculates that confusion could result from a second-chance candidate such as Brown seeking a judicial office in the primary and then a different judicial office in the general election. The plurality notes that the same risk of confusion does not exist for second-chance candidates for state board of education, because nomination for that position is by petition only, not by primary. R.C. 3513.259.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-10\">{\u00b6 53} The flaw in this argument is that primaries are possible, though not automatic, for all the other positions listed in the exception portion of R.C. 3513.04. Trustee offices can be subject to primary election if a majority of the electors petitions for a primary. R.C. 3513.253. And a board of education of a city, local, or exempted village school district or governing board of an exempted educational service may establish a nonpartisan primary by resolution. R.C. 3513.256(A). So the same possibility of confusion exists with second-chance candidates running for one board of education in a primary and a different board of education in the general election.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>{\u00b6 54} Even though the burden on relators\u2019 constitutional rights is slight, the state has not presented <em>any </em>interest to justify the distinction drawn by the amended statute. I would therefore hold that the language added to R.C. 3513.04 renders the statute unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">\n<em>Remedy</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">{\u00b6 55} Having determined that R.C. 3513.04 is unconstitutional, I address the question of remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">{\u00b6 56} The dissent agrees that amended R.C. 3513.04 is unconstitutional and would therefore grant the writ and place Brown\u2019s name on the general election ballot. But there is no explanation for how this result has been reached. Rewriting the statute to include county courts on the list of excepted offices would be an exercise of power that this court does not possess. So the only alternative is that the dissent must consider R.C. 3513.04 unconstitutional in its entirety, but the dissent has not established that such a broad remedy is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">{\u00b6 57} R.C. 1.50 provides that statutory provisions are presumptively severable. The test of severability is \u201c \u2018whether the remaining parts of the article, standing alone and without reference to the unconstitutional sections, can be effective and operable.\u2019 \u201d <em>State ex rel. Doersam v. Indus. Comm., </em>45 Ohio St.3d 115, 121, 543 N.E.2d 1169 (1989), quoting <em>State ex rel. King v. Rhodes, </em>11 Ohio St.2d 95, 101, 228 N.E.2d 653 (1967). The remainder of R.C. 3513.04 is plainly capable of standing alone without the arbitrary list of exemptions that have created the constitutional problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-9\">{\u00b6 58} I would therefore strike the language added in the 1998 amendment and return to the statute that existed at the time that this court decided <em>Purdy, </em>77 Ohio St.3d 338, 673 N.E.2d 1351. And once this is done, the pyrrhic nature of Brown\u2019s victory becomes apparent. R.C. 3513.04 would still bar Brown from the November ballot; even though his constitutional argument is meritorious, he would nevertheless not be entitled to a writ of mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-10\">{\u00b6 59} For these reasons, I concur in the judgment reached by the plurality.</p>\n<judges id=\"b520-11\">Lanzinger, J., concurs in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b514-11\">. I join the portion of the plurality opinion analyzing \u2014 and rejecting \u2014 the applicability of laches.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b516-11\">. To ask whether the state had <em>\u201cany </em>\u201d basis to justify the statute arguably imposes an even more permissive standard of review than rational-basis scrutiny.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b520-12\">Pfeifer, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ABF\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-13\">{\u00b6 60} There is no legitimate reason to allow respondent Ashtabula County Board of Elections to refuse to place relator Thomas Brown\u2019s name on the November 4, 2014 ballot. In <em>State ex rel. Purdy v. Clermont Cty. Bd. of Elections, </em>77 Ohio St.3d 338, 347, 673 N.E.2d 1351 (1997) (Moyer, C.J., dissenting), Chief Justice Moyer stated that \u201capplication of the [sore-loser] statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>burdened Purdy\u2019s and Tighe\u2019s constitutional rights by prohibiting their candidacies.\u201d The same is true of Brown.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">{\u00b6 61} Brown\u2019s constitutional right to ballot access, when he is an otherwise eligible candidate, is being infringed by the application of R.C. 3513.04. There is no great principle behind the statute and it ought not be entitled to a presumption of constitutionality. <em>See Wisconsin v. Pelican Ins. Co., </em>127 U.S. 265, 297, 8 S.Ct. 1370, 32 L.Ed. 239 (1888), <em>overruled on other grounds, Milwaukee Cty. v. M.E. White Co., </em>296 U.S. 268, 56 S.Ct. 229, 80 L.Ed. 220 (1935); <em>Ohio Grocers Assn. v. Levin, </em>123 Ohio St.3d 303, 2009-Ohio-4872, 916 N.E.2d 446, \u00b6 70-81 (Pfeifer, J., dissenting). When a statute infringes on a fundamental constitutional right, we ought not acquiesce because of an unwarranted presumption of constitutionality. Indeed, the presumption should go the other way; the statute should be presumed unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">{\u00b6 62} Election laws that limit ballot access for prospective candidates are subject to review depending on the level of the limitation. <em>Purdy, </em>at 343. If we assume, as the plurality opinion does, that R.C. 3513.04 is a reasonable, nondiscriminatory restriction, then it can be justified by an important regulatory interest. <em>Id., </em>citing <em>Anderson v. Celebrezze, </em>460 U.S. 780, 788, 103 S.Ct. 1564, 75 L.Ed.2d 547 (1983). As support for the interests that justify R.C. 3513.04, the attorney general cites the following statement from <em>Purdy: </em>\u201cOhio clearly has a legitimate interest in preventing potential conflicts among party members, an interest in preventing the possibility of voter confusion, and an interest in preventing candidacies that may conceivably be prompted by short-range goals.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 346.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">{\u00b6 63} The importance of these interests is a chimera. Preventing potential conflicts among party members may be a legitimate interest, but how preventing an eligible candidate from appearing on the ballot for a nonpartisan office advances that interest is obscure and unexplained. Minimizing the possibility of voter confusion may also be a legitimate interest, but not enough to prevent an eligible candidate from running for office. Moreover, only the most well-informed voters are likely to realize that a candidate for one of the offices in this case had been a candidate for the other office earlier in the year and, because they are well-informed, they are unlikely to be confused. The claim that Ohio has an interest in preventing candidacies that may conceivably be prompted by short-term goals is absurd, and that interest is clearly unmanageable. For one thing, politics is increasingly an endeavor devoted to short-term goals; for another, who is to judge whether a goal is short term? In short, none of the arguments suggested by the attorney general advance important regulatory interests \u2014 and they are insufficient to justify burdening the constitutional right to ballot access.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Af7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>Louis E.
