At the hearing, Gorby admitted the underlying facts and affirmed her stipulations, except that she withdrew her original stipulation of a violation of Prof.Cond.R. 8.4(c) (prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-14\">{\u00b6 4} The panel issued a report setting forth its findings of fact, finding that Gorby committed all of the alleged misconduct except for an alleged violation of Prof.Cond.R. 8.4(h) (prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct that adversely reflects on the lawyer\u2019s fitness to practice law), which the panel unanimously dismissed by separate entry. Finding that Gorby\u2019s conduct resulted from a family matter gone bad and that she presented little, if any, risk to the public, the panel recommended that her license to practice law in Ohio be suspended for one year, all stayed on the conditions that she commit no further misconduct and submit to a one-year period of monitored probation focusing on law-office and trust-account management.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>{\u00b6 5} The board adopted the panel\u2019s findings of fact and misconduct and its recommended sanction. Relator objects to the aggravating and mitigating factors found by the board and urges this court to impose a one-year actual suspension from the practice of law. For the reasons that follow, we overrule relator\u2019s objections, adopt the board\u2019s findings of fact and misconduct, and suspend Gorby from the practice of law for one year, all stayed on the recommended conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">{\u00b6 6} In 2010, Gorby reduced her workload to approximately 25 hours per week and limited her practice to court-appointed criminal defense and guardian ad litem work in Columbiana County.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">{\u00b6 7} In April 2011, Gorby\u2019s sister, Donna Adams, contacted her regarding a foreclosure action filed against her and her husband, Troy Adams, in the Mahoning County Court of Common Pleas. Although she did not normally handle civil matters or practice outside of Columbiana County, Gorby agreed to represent them in the foreclosure action at no charge. There was no written fee agreement, and Gorby failed to advise the Adamses that she did not carry professional liability insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-8\">{\u00b6 8} Gorby filed an answer and counterclaim against the lender in the foreclosure action on May 19, 2011, and continued to actively represent the Adamses in the matter until the court issued a judgment against them in May 2012. In connection with this representation, Gorby agreed to receive payments from the Adamses and hold the funds in trust until they saved enough money to stop the foreclosure. Having limited her practice to court-appointed work, Gorby did not maintain a client trust account, so beginning in June 2011, she deposited the money she received from the Adamses into her business checking account.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-9\">{\u00b6 9} From June 27, 2011, through March 7, 2012, Gorby deposited a total of $6,400 from the Adamses and $4,600.78 of her personal funds into her business checking account. Although the Adamses did not authorize her to use their funds for any purpose other than payment of their mortgage, Gorby began writing checks from the account in July 2011 to cover personal and business expenses unrelated to their foreclosure. Her account balance soon dipped below the amount that she was supposed to be holding in trust for the Adamses \u2014 reaching a low of $96.49 when it should have contained $5,500 of the Adamses\u2019 money \u2014 and remained inadequate in varying degrees to satisfy that obligation until November 2, 2012, when she deposited $5,500 in personal funds from her husband\u2019s retirement account. Just days before making that deposit, she submitted a response to relator\u2019s letter of inquiry in which she was less than forthcoming about the situation \u2014 advising relator that she was \u201cpresently holding $5,500\u201d on the Adamses\u2019 behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>{\u00b6 10} By November 2012, the Adamses had divorced and Mr. Adams had filed for bankruptcy. On or about November 28, 2012, Gorby received a letter from Mr. Adams\u2019s bankruptcy trustee, requesting that one-half of the $5,550 in entrusted funds be disbursed to him. Because Gorby had withdrawn funds from the account to cover personal and business expenses even after depositing the funds from her husband\u2019s retirement account, she deposited an additional $100 of personal funds on December 4, 2012, to bring the account balance to $5,584.49. She issued a $2,775 check to Mr. Adams\u2019s bankruptcy trustee on December 7, 2012, and another check for the same amount to her sister on December 13, 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">{\u00b6 11} The board found that Gorby\u2019s conduct violated Prof.Cond.R. 1.4(c) (requiring a lawyer to inform the client if the lawyer does not maintain professional liability insurance), 1.15(a) (requiring a lawyer to hold the property of clients in an interest-bearing client trust account, separate from the lawyer\u2019s own property), and 8.4(c). We adopt the board\u2019s findings of fact and misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">Sanction</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">{\u00b6 12} When imposing sanctions for attorney misconduct, we consider relevant factors, including the ethical duties that the lawyer violated and the sanctions imposed in similar cases. <em>Stark Cty. Bar Assn. v. Buttacavoli, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 424, 2002-Ohio-4743, 775 N.E.2d 818, \u00b6 16. In making a final determination, we also weigh evidence of the aggravating and mitigating factors listed in BCGD Proc. Reg. 10(B).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">{\u00b6 13} The board found that Gorby acted with a dishonest or selfish motive when she misappropriated funds belonging to her sister and brother-in-law for her own purposes and that her misappropriation involved a pattern of misconduct. <em>See </em>BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(1)(b) and (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-9\">{\u00b6 14} The board balanced these aggravating factors against stipulated mitigating factors, including the absence of a prior disciplinary record, Gorby\u2019s timely good-faith effort to make restitution, and her full and free disclosure to the disciplinary board and a cooperative attitude toward the proceedings. <em>See </em>BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(2)(a), (c), and (d). The board also considered Gorby\u2019s uncontroverted deposition and hearing testimony regarding her tumultuous and contentious relationship with her sister. The board noted Gorby\u2019s testimony that once she became a practicing attorney, her older sister expected her to provide legal services for whatever she wanted and whenever she wanted them. Whether it was a speeding ticket or a foreclosure, her sister expected her to drop everything, no matter what was going on in her own life, and fix everything. Gorby felt that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>she could not refuse her sister\u2019s demands because if she did, her sister would call and complain and harass her or their mother and \u201ccause a big family fight and big family drama.\u201d She reported that it had \u201calways been this way\u201d and that it was easier to give in to her sister\u2019s demands than to fight. Gorby also testified that while the foreclosure was pending, she also served as the attorney for her grandmother\u2019s estate \u2014 which created intense disagreements between the sisters, who were both beneficiaries of the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">{\u00b6 15} While acknowledging that the presumptive sanction for misappropriation is disbarment, <em>see, e.g., Cleveland Bar Assn. v. Dixon, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 490, 2002-Ohio-2490, 769 N.E.2d 816, \u00b6 15, the board focused on the primary purpose of the disciplinary sanction, which is not to punish the offender but to protect the public. <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Hoppel, </em>129 Ohio St.3d 53, 2011-Ohio-2672, 950 N.E.2d 171, \u00b6 21. The board considered our decision in <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Burchinal, </em>133 Ohio St.3d 38, 2012-Ohio-3882, 975 N.E.2d 960, upon which relator relied to support his recommendation that we impose a one-year actual suspension for Gorby\u2019s misconduct. However, the board distinguished <em>Burchinal </em>on the grounds that it involved misappropriation in multiple cases, neglect of a client matter, and concealment, which warranted the imposition of a two-year suspension with 18 months stayed on conditions, whereas Gorby\u2019s misconduct involved misappropriation in just one client matter. <em>Id. </em>at If 7-11, 20. The board also found that Gorby\u2019s clients suffered no harm as a result of her misconduct and that she poses little, if any, threat to the public because her misconduct arose in the context of her very contentious family relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">{\u00b6 16} Having considered Gorby\u2019s conduct, the aggravating and mitigating factors, and this court\u2019s precedent, the board recommends that we suspend Gorby for one year but that we stay the entire suspension on the conditions that she engage in no further misconduct and submit to a one-year period of monitored probation focusing on law-office and trust-account management.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">{\u00b6 17} Relator objects to the board\u2019s findings with regard to the applicable aggravating and mitigating factors and argues that our precedent requires that we impose a sanction greater than a six-month actual suspension from the practice of law in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">{\u00b6 18} First, relator suggests that there is clear and convincing evidence to establish two aggravating factors that were not found by the board \u2014 the failure to cooperate with relator\u2019s investigation and the failure to acknowledge the wrongful nature of the conduct at issue. Relator argues that Gorby\u2019s early representation that she was \u201cpresently holding $5,500\u201d entrusted to her by her sister and brother-in-law, when she had actually misappropriated the money, establishes that she failed to cooperate in the disciplinary investigation. However, relator was aware of this misstatement in Gorby\u2019s response to his initial letter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>of inquiry when he stipulated that Gorby made full and free disclosure to the board and demonstrated a cooperative attitude toward the disciplinary proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">{\u00b6 19} Moreover, it appears that Gorby cooperated in the investigation from that point forward, with the exception that at the hearing, she withdrew her stipulation that she had engaged in dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation in violation of Prof.Cond.R. 8.4(c). Relator contends that because she withdrew that stipulation, she has refused to admit that her conduct was wrongful. While relator is correct that Gorby stated that she did not feel that she had stolen money from her sister, she also fully acknowledged that she took the money and used it without authorization and apologized for her actions, and the board believed that she showed genuine remorse. She explained that it was difficult for her to differentiate between her horrible familial relationship \"with her sister and her role as her sister\u2019s attorney. Moreover, Gorby testified that this conduct would never have happened with a client other than her sister and that it would not happen again.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">{\u00b6 20} We are not bound by the findings of fact or conclusions of law of the panel or board in attorney disciplinary proceedings. <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Furth, </em>93 Ohio St.3d 173, 181, 754 N.E.2d 219 (2001). However, we generally defer to the credibility determinations of the panel unless the record weighs heavily against those findings, because the panel had the opportunity to observe the witnesses firsthand. <em>Cincinnati Bar Assn. v. Statzer, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 14, 2003-Ohio-6649, 800 N.E.2d 1117, \u00b6 8. Here, the record does not weigh heavily against the findings of the panel, as adopted by the board, and therefore we defer to the panel\u2019s credibility determinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">{\u00b6 21} Relator also argues that a familial relationship between the grievant and the respondent and the absence of harm to a client are not mitigating factors. Relator is correct that BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B) does not specifically identify either of these factors as mitigating. But the rule also expressly requires the board to consider \u201call relevant factors\u201d in determining the appropriate sanction for attorney misconduct. And these factors are most certainly relevant in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">{\u00b6 22} Gorby testified, and the board found, that she and her sister have always had a contentious relationship and that since she obtained her law license, her sister \u2014 and her mother \u2014 have expected her to drop everything to handle her sister\u2019s legal crises with no reimbursement for her time or the expenses she incurs on her sister\u2019s behalf. She indicated that it was easier to go along with her sister\u2019s demands than to fight them and cause \u201ca big family fight and big family drama.\u201d However, she reports that she has learned her lesson about handling legal matters for her family and that it will never happen again.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>{\u00b6 23} In <em>Stark Cty. Bar Assn. v. Ake, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 266, 2006-Ohio-5704, 855 N.E.2d 1206, \u00b6 4, 32, attorney Ake knowingly violated a temporary order in his personal divorce proceeding by writing a $94,000 check to his secretary. He then used the funds to pay for a condominium that he had agreed to buy and used his one-half interest in a piece of marital real property to secure a $400,000 individual line of credit. All told, he violated the court\u2019s orders on five separate occasions\u2014 as a party, an attorney of record, and an officer of the court \u2014 because it suited his economic interest to do so. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 39. While Ake\u2019s misconduct did not involve the misappropriation of client funds, it did involve the misappropriation of more than $90,000 in marital funds in violation of a court order that was issued to preserve the funds pending an equitable distribution of marital assets by the court or by consent of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">{\u00b6 24} We found as aggravating factors in <em>Ake </em>that the respondent\u2019s actions were dishonest and self-serving, that he repeatedly violated several of the same disciplinary rules, and that he refused to recognize that his conduct rose to the level of an ethical violation. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 41. Mitigating factors included the absence of a prior disciplinary record, full and free disclosure during the disciplinary process, and evidence of Ake\u2019s good character and reputation apart from the charged misconduct. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 42. Citing testimony and evidence of his integrity and competence, we found that Ake \u201cwould not disobey a court order in any situation other than the charged atmosphere of ending his own marriage.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 46. Confident that he would never repeat his transgressions, we suspended him from the practice of law for six months, all stayed on the condition that he commit no further misconduct. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 47. Thus, we recognized that an attorney whose only professional misconduct occurs in his own emotionally charged case may warrant a lesser sanction because the conduct is not likely to reoccur and does not pose a threat to the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">{\u00b6 25} We have also stated that because it is of the utmost importance that attorneys maintain their personal and office accounts separate from their clients\u2019 accounts, a violation of the rules we have established to protect client funds warrants a substantial sanction whether or not the client has been harmed. <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Vogtsberger, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 458, 2008-Ohio-4571, 895 N.E.2d 158, \u00b6 10. The degree of harm caused by the conduct may, nonetheless, be relevant in determining the appropriate level of that sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">{\u00b6 26} In this case, relator agreed at the hearing that the Adamses suffered no financial harm as a result of Gorby\u2019s misconduct \u2014 although the bank obtained a judgment against them, they were ultimately able to keep their home. While relator argued that they were denied timely access to their funds, the undisputed evidence demonstrates that when Mrs. Adams first requested the return of those funds, the Adamses\u2019 divorce was pending and Mr. Adams had filed for bankrupt<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>cy. But relator agreed that if the money had been sitting in a trust account at that time, it would have been proper for Gorby to wait until she received direction from those courts to determine how the funds should be distributed. And while relator now asserts that the Adamses suffered psychological harm as the result of Gorby\u2019s breach of trust, there is no evidence to establish whether such harm occurred, because neither of them was called to testify.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A6\">Scott J. Drexel, Disciplinary Counsel, and Bruce T. Davis, Assistant Disciplinary Counsel, for relator.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AzE\">Jennifer Ann Gorby, pro se.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">{\u00b6 27} Relator\u2019s argument that the absence of harm cannot obviate the need to sanction an attorney for misconduct is inapposite. The board does not state that Gorby should not be sanctioned at all for her misconduct because there was no harm. Rather, the board states that in light of all of the mitigating factors\u2014 including the absence of harm to the clients and the fact that Gorby\u2019s sole misconduct in her nearly 13-year legal career arose out of a contentious family dispute \u2014 a lesser sanction will be sufficient both to protect the public and to deter future misconduct. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">{\u00b6 28} Accordingly, we overrule relator\u2019s objections and suspend Jennifer Ann Gorby from the practice of law in Ohio for one year, all stayed on the conditions that she engage in no further misconduct and submit to a one-year period of monitored probation focusing on law-office and trust-account management. Costs are taxed to Gorby.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b179-9\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Pfeifer, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, Kennedy, French, and O\u2019Neill, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b173-15\">.
