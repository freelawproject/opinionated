The commission ultimately denied the claim on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-17\">{\u00b6 2} Alhamarshah appealed the denial of his claim to the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas pursuant to R.C. 4123.512(A). About a month later, he filed a complaint for a writ of mandamus in the Tenth District Court of Appeals alleging that the commission abused its discretion when it allowed the purported <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>employer to appeal the bureau\u2019s initial order. Because the appeal in the common pleas court provided an adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law, Alhamarshah is not entitled to relief in mandamus. Consequently, we affirm, but on grounds other than those stated by the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">{\u00b6 3} On September 21, 2009, Alhamarshah was injured when he fell while trying to cut a tree branch. On December 21, 2009, he filed an application for workers\u2019 compensation benefits alleging that that injury had occurred while he was employed as a laborer for appellee Mohamed Salem, d.b.a. Ballmohd, L.L.C.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">{\u00b6 4} On January 7, 2010, the bureau allowed the claim against Salem as the employer and ordered payment of medical benefits and temporary-total-disability compensation. The order informed the parties that the decision would become final unless a written appeal was received within 14 days. The order further advised the parties to contact \u201cJolene M\u201d at the bureau\u2019s Columbus service office with any questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-8\">{\u00b6 5} Salem asked a friend, Abdul Alnobani, to telephone Jolene to ask about filing an appeal. Both Salem and Alnobani spoke with Jolene on a three-way call, and she told them how to proceed. Alnobani then faxed some documents to \u201cJolin\u201d that allegedly disproved any employer-employee relationship. The cover page to the faxed documents identified the subject as \u201cMustafa Alhamarshah\u2014 Mohammad Salem,\u201d but it did not include the claim number or date of the order being appealed. Upon receipt, the words \u201cconstrue as appeal\u201d were handwritten on the cover page, apparently by a bureau employee, and the documents were forwarded to the appeals section of the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-9\">{\u00b6 6} The commission ultimately concluded that Salem\u2019s appeal substantially complied with the requirements in R.C. 4123.511(F) for an administrative notice of appeal and that there was no evidence that Alhamarshah had been prejudiced by any omission in the notice of appeal. The commission accordingly accepted the appeal as valid and referred the matter to a district hearing officer for consideration of the merits of the initial application.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-10\">{\u00b6 7} The hearing officer disallowed the claim on the merits, finding that Alhamarshah was not an employee of Salem, and the commission affirmed that order. Alhamarshah appealed to the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas pursuant to R.C. 4123.512. About a month later, he filed a complaint for a writ of mandamus in the court of appeals, alleging that the commission\u2019s order determining that Salem\u2019s administrative appeal was valid was an abuse of discretion and contrary to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-11\">{\u00b6 8} A magistrate determined that the mandamus action was premature in light of the case pending in common pleas court and that the writ should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>denied on that basis. By the time the court of appeals considered Alhamarshah\u2019s objections, he had dismissed his case in the common pleas court without prejudice, subject to refiling within one year. The court of appeals proceeded to consider the merits of the mandamus action and concluded that the commission did not abuse its discretion when it allowed Salem\u2019s appeal from the bureau\u2019s initial decision in Alhamarshah\u2019s favor to proceed. The court denied the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">{\u00b6 9} Alhamarshah\u2019s appeal as of right is now before the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">\n<em>Legal Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">{\u00b6 10} Once the commission has issued a final order determining the claimant\u2019s entitlement to participate in the workers\u2019 compensation fund, any party may appeal the order, except for decisions as to the extent of disability, to the court of common pleas pursuant to R.C. 4123.512. R.C. 4123.511(E) and 4123.512(A); <em>State ex rel. Liposchak v. Indus. Comm., </em>90 Ohio St.3d 276, 278-279, 737 N.E.2d 519 (2000). This court has held that decisions determining an employee\u2019s right to participate in the workers\u2019 compensation system because of a specific injury or occupational disease are appealable to the court of common pleas. <em>Felty v. AT &amp; T Technologies, Inc., </em>65 Ohio St.3d 234, 602 N.E.2d 1141 (1992), paragraph one of the syllabus; <em>Afrates v. Lorain, </em>63 Ohio St.3d 22, 26, 584 N.E.2d 1175 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-8\">{\u00b6 11} The lack of an adequate remedy in the ordinary course of the law is a necessary prerequisite for relief in mandamus. <em>State ex rel. Consolidation Coal Co. v. Indus. Comm., </em>18 Ohio St.3d 281, 284, 480 N.E.2d 807 (1985), citing <em>State ex rel. Sibarco Corp. v. Berea, </em>7 Ohio St.2d 85, 88, 218 N.E.2d 428 (1966). When the relator has a plain and adequate remedy at law by way of appeal, courts lack authority to exercise jurisdictional discretion and must deny the writ, regardless of whether the relator used the remedy. <em>Id.; State ex rel. Davet v. Sutula, </em>8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 96548, 2011-Ohio-2803, 2011 WL 2409641, \u00b6 10. This is a threshold question that we must consider even when the court of appeals has not addressed the issue. <em>State ex rel. Woodbury v. Spitler, </em>40 Ohio St.2d 1, 3, 318 N.E.2d 165 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-9\">{\u00b6 12} In this case, the commission decided that the documentation submitted on behalf of the purported employer substantially complied with the statutory requirements for a notice of an appeal of the bureau\u2019s initial order. This decision conferred jurisdiction on the commission to proceed to consider the merits of the purported employer\u2019s appeal. The commission\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction resulted in a decision denying the claimant\u2019s right to participate in the workers\u2019 compensation system. Consequently, the decision allowing the appeal to proceed was essential to the ultimate determination that denied the claimant\u2019s participation in the workers\u2019 compensation system. As such, the commission\u2019s decision to accept the appeal as valid was appealable pursuant to R.C. 4123.512. <em>See Consolidation Coal Co. </em>at 284-285.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A8V\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>Malek &amp; Malek and Douglas C.
