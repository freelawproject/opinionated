Because our holding adopts the analysis of the Fifth District, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-11\">Relevant Background</p>\n<p id=\"b471-12\">{\u00b6 3} The Interstate Agreement on Detainers (\u201cIAD\u201d) is a compact among 48 states, the District of Columbia, and the United States that establishes procedures for one jurisdiction to obtain temporary custody of a prisoner incarcerated in another jurisdiction for the purpose of bringing the prisoner to trial. <em>Cuyler v. Adams, </em>449 U.S. 433, 435, 101 S.Ct. 703, 66 L.Ed.2d 641 (1981), fn 1. Ohio adopted the IAD in 1969 and codified its provisions in R.C. 2963.30. Am.S.B. No. 356 (\u201cS.B. 356\u201d), 133 Ohio Laws, Part 1,1067.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-13\">{\u00b6 4} The IAD arose from a report issued in 1948 that addressed difficulties that prisoners and state authorities faced regarding the use of detainers. <em>United States v. Mauro, </em>436 U.S. 340, 349-350, 98 S.Ct. 1834, 56 L.Ed.2d 329 (1978); <em>see also </em>Meadows, <em>Interstate Agreement on Detainers and the Rights it Created, </em>18 Akron L.Rev. 691 (1985). The Council for State Governments drafted the legislation in 1956 and included the draft with its Suggested State Legislation Programs for 1957. <em>Id.; Carchman v. Nash, </em>473 U.S. 716, 719, 105 S.Ct. 3401, 87 L.Ed.2d 516 (1985). In 1970, Congress enacted the IAD into law on behalf of the United States and the District of Columbia. <em>Mauro </em>at 353. For the states, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>IAD is a congressionally sanctioned interstate compact under the Compact Clause, Article I, Section 10, of the United States Constitution. <em>Carchman </em>at 719.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">{\u00b6 5} The term \u201cdetainer\u201d is not defined in the IAD. When the legislation was presented to Congress, however, a \u201cdetainer\u201d was defined as \u201c \u2018a notification filed with the institution in which a prisoner is serving a sentence, advising [that he is wanted to face] pending criminal charges in another jurisdiction.\u2019 \u201d (Bracketed material added.) Meadows, 18 Akron L.Rev. at 695, fn. 37, quoting S.Rep. No. 91-1356, at 2 (1970), reprinted in 1970 U.S.C.C.A.N. 4864, 4865.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">{\u00b6 6} The drafters of the IAD recognized that detainers, which could be issued informally but never acted on by prosecutors, had certain detrimental effects on prisoners because they posed a threat of further prosecution and could lead to additional sanctions, higher security classification, loss of privileges, or ineligibility for rehabilitative programs and parole. <em>See </em>Meadows, 18 Akron L.Rev. at 691-692. Thus, the legislation recognized that \u201ccharges outstanding against a prisoner, detainers based on untried indictments, information or complaints, and difficulties in securing speedy trials of persons already incarcerated in other jurisdictions\u201d cause uncertainties that \u201cobstruct programs of prisoner treatment and rehabilitation.\u201d R.C. 2963.30, Article I.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">{\u00b6 7} To address these uncertainties, the purpose of the IAD is twofold. Meadows, 18 Akron L.Rev. at 695. First, the IAD expressly states that its purpose is \u201cto encourage the expeditious and orderly disposition of such charges and determination of the proper status of any and all detainers based on untried indictments, informations or complaints.\u201d R.C. 2963.30, Article I. Second, the IAD is intended to provide cooperative procedures to facilitate interstate transfers. <em>Id. </em>Taken together, the objective of the IAD is \u201cto implement a defendant\u2019s right to a speedy trial and to avoid excessive interference with a prisoner\u2019s rehabilitation in the state prison system.\u201d <em>United States v. Palmer, </em>574 F.2d 164, 167 (3d Cir.1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">{\u00b6 8} The IAD outlines two procedures by which a prisoner against whom a detainer has been lodged may be transferred to the temporary custody of another state for disposition of charges pending there. \u201cOne of these procedures may be invoked by the prisoner; the other by the prosecuting attorney of the receiving State.\u201d <em>Cuyler, </em>449 U.S. at 444, 101 S.Ct. 703, 66 L.Ed.2d 641.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-9\">{\u00b6 9} Under the prisoner-initiated procedure outlined in the statute, the \u201cwarden, commissioner of corrections or other officials having custody of the prisoner\u201d must promptly inform the prisoner of any detainer as well as the prisoner\u2019s rights in making a request for final disposition. R.C. 2963.30, Article III(c). The prisoner may then provide a written notice for final disposition to the warden, commissioner of corrections, or other official having custody of him, who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>must forward it to the \u201cappropriate prosecuting official and court\u201d in the receiving state, that is, the state where the detainer is pending. <em>Id., </em>Article 11(c) and 111(b). The receiving state must bring the prisoner to trial within 180 days of receiving the prisoner\u2019s request for disposition, or the charges will be dismissed with prejudice for good cause shown. <em>Id., </em>Article 111(a) and (d). A prisoner invoking the IAD also waives any objection to extradition. <em>Id., </em>Article 111(e). Because a prisoner\u2019s request under the statute operates as a request for final disposition of any untried indictments on which a detainer from the receiving state is based, the authorities with custody of the prisoner must notify all the prosecuting officers and courts in the receiving state of any request for final disposition by the prisoner. <em>Id., </em>Article 111(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">{\u00b6 10} Under the prosecutor-initiated procedure outlined in the statute, the receiving state has 120 days after the prisoner\u2019s arrival in the state to bring the prisoner to trial. <em>Id., </em>Article IV(c). To initiate the procedure, the prosecuting official in the receiving state must make a written request for temporary custody to the \u201cappropriate authorities of the state in which the prisoner is incarcerated,\u201d <em>id., </em>Article IV(a), also known as the \u201csending state,\u201d <em>id., </em>Article 11(b). The governor of the sending state may disapprove the request sua sponte or upon the motion of the prisoner. <em>Id., </em>Article IY(a). After the sending state receives a request, the authorities with custody over the prisoner must provide the receiving state with a certificate providing certain details regarding the prisoner\u2019s incarceration, including the time remaining to be served and any time for parole eligibility. <em>Id., </em>Article IV(b). They must also provide notice of the request for custody to all other prosecuting authorities and courts from the receiving state who have lodged detainers against the prisoner. <em>Id., </em>Article IV(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">{\u00b6 11} Under either procedure, if a trial is not held in the receiving state \u201cprior to the return of the prisoner to the original place of imprisonment,\u201d the charges are to be dismissed with prejudice. <em>Id., </em>Article 111(d) and IV(e). This provision is referred to as the \u201cantishuttling provision\u201d of the IAJD. <em>United States v. Taylor, </em>173 F.3d 538, 540 (6th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">{\u00b6 12} Resolution of this appeal requires our interpretation of the language in Article III of the IAD, which states that the statute applies to a defendant who has begun a term of imprisonment \u201cin a penal or correctional institution of a party state.\u201d R.C. 2963.30, Article 111(a). More specifically, we resolve the parties\u2019 dispute over whether \u201ca penal or correctional institution of a party state\u201d includes a county jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-8\">Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b473-9\">{\u00b6 13} On August 2, 2010, appellee James Black was indicted in Ashland County on charges of theft and breaking and entering. A warrant was issued for his arrest. At the time, Black was being held in a county jail in Maryland <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>awaiting sentencing and was notified of the pending charges in Ashland County as well as of separate charges that had been filed in Richland and Franklin counties.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">{\u00b6 14} In February 2011, Black began to serve a one-year sentence in the Cecil County Detention Center in Elkton, Maryland. Prior to beginning his sentence, Black attempted to use the prisoner-initiated procedures under the IAD to notify Ashland County of his incarceration in Maryland and his availability for disposition of the charges pending in Ashland County. But the Ashland County prosecutor notified him that his request was premature because he had not begun his term of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">{\u00b6 15} In March 2011, with the assistance of the jail administrator in the Cecil County Detention Center, Black again initiated IAD requests for final disposition of his charges in Ashland, Richland, and Franklin Counties. In April 2011, the Richland County prosecutor\u2019s office responded to Black\u2019s request and prepared to transfer Black from Maryland to resolve charges of receiving stolen property, forgery, and tampering with evidence in that county.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">{\u00b6 16} On May 27, 2011, Black was transported from Maryland to Richland County, Ohio, for disposition of the charges pending there. On July 8, 2011, while awaiting final disposition of the Richland County charges, Black was transferred to Ashland County for arraignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">{\u00b6 17} Black pleaded not guilty, and the Ashland County Common Pleas Court scheduled trial for October 11, 2011, with no objection from Black or his counsel. The judge initially ordered that Black be held in the Ashland County jail until trial, but the court modified the order to temporarily return Black to Richland County because he was scheduled to be sentenced there and because his legal papers and medical provisions were there.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-9\">{\u00b6 18} Black was returned to Richland County where, after pleading guilty to a felony charge of tampering with evidence, he was sentenced to three years of community control. On August 1, 2011, without explanation, and before the trial was held in Ashland County, Black was sent from Ohio back to incarceration in Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-10\">{\u00b6 19} On August 22, 2011, Black moved to dismiss the Ashland County case. He asserted that the state had violated his speedy-trial rights by failing to prosecute him within the time required by the IAD under R.C. 2963.30. The trial court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-11\">{\u00b6 20} Black testified that he made multiple requests of the Ashland County prosecutor regarding the charges pending there, including requests that he be permitted to plea in absentia and to receive a sentence that would run concurrently with his Maryland incarceration. Black testified that he was ineligible for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>parole in Maryland and that he was denied participation in a drug-rehabilitation program and a community program because of the unresolved charges in Ashland County.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">{\u00b6 21} According to Black, his Maryland sentence ended on September 11, 2011. But Black refused to be extradited to Ohio. He remained incarcerated in Maryland until December 2011 when a Maryland judge allowed him to post bond for his release.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">{\u00b6 22} On October 6, 2011, the Ashland County Common Pleas Court, stating that it had received notice that Black was still incarcerated in Maryland and scheduled to be released in December, sua sponte ordered that the October trial date be continued to December 6, 2011. The court noted in its judgment entry that \u201c[defendant has indicated to defense counsel that he will not voluntarily return to the State of Ohio upon his release from incarceration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">{\u00b6 23} Black eventually returned to Ohio on his own after posting bond in Maryland. He was arrested in Medina County, where he also had an outstanding misdemeanor charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">{\u00b6 24} In January 2012, the state offered Black an opportunity to plead guilty to the three counts pending in the original 2010 indictment in Ashland County and notified Black that if he did not, the state would re-indict Black on additional felony burglary and perjury counts. Black did not change his plea and on January 26, 2012, he was re-indicted on two counts of theft, one count of breaking and entering, and one count of burglary. The new indictment was assigned a new case number, case No. 12-CRI-010, and the court ultimately dismissed the case proceeding under the original indictment, case No. 10-CRI-080.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-9\">{\u00b6 25} On February 3, 2012, a hearing was held on Black\u2019s motion to dismiss the new indictment in which he argued that his speedy-trial rights were violated because the applicable time limits under the IAD were exceeded without resolution of the charges in Ashland County. On February 14, 2012, the trial court overruled Black\u2019s motion to dismiss. The court concluded that the IAD did not apply, because Black, while in Maryland, was incarcerated in county jail and not in a state penal or correctional institution.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-10\">{\u00b6 26} The Ashland County case proceeded to trial and Black was ultimately convicted of two misdemeanor counts of theft and one felony count of breaking and entering. He was sentenced to a term of 12 months in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-11\">{\u00b6 27} The Fifth District Court of Appeals reversed the trial court\u2019s decision, holding that the trial court had erred in overruling Black\u2019s motion to dismiss. The appellate court held that the IAD did not distinguish between terms of imprisonment in county jails or state prisons and that it therefore applied to Black even though he was incarcerated in a county facility in Maryland. 2013-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>Ohio-976, 989 N.E.2d 151, \u00b6 27 (5th Dist.). The appellate court also recognized that the Eighth District Court of Appeals came to an opposite conclusion in <em>State v. Wyer, </em>8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 82962, 2003-Ohio-6926, 2003 WL 22976573. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">{\u00b6 28} In <em>Wyer, </em>the Eighth District held that an out-of-state county jail in which the defendant was serving a term of imprisonment was not a \u201cpenal or correctional institution of a party state\u201d under the IAD, and therefore, the time limits under the IAD did not apply to a prisoner in a county jail. <em>Wyer </em>at \u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">{\u00b6 29} The Fifth District certified that its decision was in conflict with <em>Wyer. </em>We determined that a conflict exists and accepted the state\u2019s discretionary appeal on the same question as the certified conflict: whether the term \u201cpenal or correctional institution of a party state,\u201d as used in R.C. 2963.30, includes a county jail. 135 Ohio St.3d 1469, 2013-Ohio-2512, 989 N.E.2d 69. We consolidated the actions because they present the same legal question. 135 Ohio St.3d 1469, 2013-Ohio-2512, 989 N.E.2d 70.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">{\u00b6 30} For the reasons below, we agree with the Fifth District\u2019s analysis and hold that the term \u201cpenal or correctional institution of a party state,\u201d as it is used in R.C. 2963.30, includes a county jail as well as a state prison or correctional facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">The Certified \u2014 Conflict Cases</p>\n<p id=\"Aaq\"><em>The Eighth District Opinion: </em>Wyer</p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">{\u00b6 31} In <em>Wyer, </em>the defendant was sentenced to 12 months\u2019 imprisonment in a county jail in California. 2003-Ohio-6926, 2003 WL 22976573, at \u00b6 5, 13. At the same time, charges were pending against him in Cuyahoga County. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 5. The defendant was returned to Cuyahoga County for resolution of the charges there, but he moved to dismiss the case under the IAD for failure to commence trial within 180 days. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 8. The trial court denied the motion to dismiss and concluded that for the IAD time limits to apply, the defendant must be incarcerated in a state penal or correctional institution. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 12. The trial court reasoned that \u201c \u2018[i]f the legislative intent were to include both types of incarceration (i.e., local and state), the statute would have so read.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting the trial court. The Eighth District agreed and concluded that a county jail was not a correctional institution for purposes of the IAD because \u201c[t]he legislature chose not to include language encompassing all correctional facilities, rather selecting only institutions of a \u2018party state.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-9\">{\u00b6 32} Other jurisdictions have also held that the IAD does not apply to prisoners in county jails. <em>See, e.g., State v. Breen, </em>126 Idaho 305, 882 P.2d 472 (App.1994) (holding that the IAD did not apply to an inmate held in a local jail while serving an existing sentence following parole revocation and before sentenc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>ing on new charges); <em>State v. Wade, </em>105 Nev. 206, 772 P.2d 1291 (1989) (holding that applying the IAD to inmates in county jails would frustrate the rehabilitative purposes of the IAD); <em>Dorsey v. State, </em>490 N.E.2d 260 (Ind.1986), <em>overruled on other grounds, Wright v. State, </em>658 N.E.2d 563 (Ind.1995) (holding that a defendant in a county jail could not invoke the IAD, because the statute was intended to benefit those in state prison).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-4\"><em>The Fifth District Opinion: </em>Black</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">{\u00b6 33} In the decision at issue in this appeal, the Fifth District concluded that <em>Wyer </em>was not persuasive. 2013-Ohio-976, 989 N.E.2d 151, at \u00b6 23. It instead looked to decisions from other jurisdictions, primarily a decision from an Arizona appellate court in <em>Escalanti v. Maricopa Cty. Superior Ct., </em>165 Ariz. 385, 799 P.2d 5 (App.1990). 2013-Ohio-976, 989 N.E.2d 151, at \u00b6 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">{\u00b6 34} In <em>Escalanti, </em>the Arizona court held that the clear and unambiguous language of the IAD is applicable to inmates in county jails. <em>Escalanti </em>at 388. The court relied on definitions of \u201cpenal institution\u201d and \u201ccorrectional institution\u201d in the Fifth Edition of Black\u2019s Law Dictionary that did not distinguish between jails and prisons. <em>Id. </em>at 387. Agreeing with the rationale in <em>Escalanti, </em>the Fifth District concluded that the IAD \u201capplies to offenders held in county jails as well as state penal or correctional facilities.\u201d 2013-Ohio-976, 989 N.E.2d 151, at \u00b6 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">{\u00b6 35} In addition to an Arizona appellate court and our Fifth District Court of Appeals, other jurisdictions have also held that the IAD applies to inmates in both county jails and state prisons. <em>See, e.g., People v. Walton, </em>167 P.3d 163 (Colo.App.2007) (holding that applying the IAD to inmates in county jails is consistent with the purposes of the IAD); <em>State v. Lock, </em>839 S.W.2d 436 (Tenn.Crim.App.1992) (holding that the physical location of the prisoner should not control the application of the IAD so long as the prisoner is serving a term of imprisonment); <em>Felix v. United States, </em>508 A.2d 101 (D.C.App.1986) (holding that the relevant inquiry is whether the prisoner has begun serving his term of imprisonment regardless of the type of correctional facility).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b477-9\">{\u00b6 36} We are persuaded by the Fifth District and the Arizona court\u2019s reasoning in <em>Escalanti. </em>Thus, we reject the Eighth District\u2019s interpretation of R.C. 2963.30.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-10\">{\u00b6 37} Our role in cases of statutory construction is to determine legislative intent by looking to the language of the statute and the purpose to be accomplished by the statute. <em>Boley v. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co., </em>125 Ohio St.3d 510, 2010-Ohio-2550, 929 N.E.2d 448, \u00b6 20. When the statute\u2019s meaning is clear and unambiguous, we apply the statute as written. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b478-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>{\u00b6 38} A statute is ambiguous when it is reasonably susceptible to more than one meaning. <em>State v. Jordan, </em>89 Ohio St.3d 488, 492, 733 N.E.2d 601 (2000). If a statute is ambiguous, \u201ccourts seek to interpret the statutory provision in a manner that most readily furthers the legislative purpose as reflected in the wording used in the legislation.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Toledo Edison Co. v. Clyde, </em>76 Ohio St.3d 508, 513, 668 N.E.2d 498 (1996). To determine the General Assembly\u2019s intent, the court may consider several factors, including the object sought to be obtained, the legislative history, and the consequences of a particular construction. R.C. 1.49.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">{\u00b6 39} Neither the IAD nor any provision of the Revised Code define \u201cpenal institution\u201d or \u201ccorrectional institution.\u201d In the absence of a definition of a word or phrase used in a statute, words are to be given their common, ordinary, and accepted meaning. <em>Wachendorf v. Shaver, </em>149 Ohio St. 231, 78 N.E.2d 370 (1948), paragraph five of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">{\u00b6 40} The current edition of <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>does not define the terms \u201ccorrectional institution\u201d or \u201cpenal institution,\u201d but instead refers readers searching for these definitions to the term \u201cprison.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>420, 1313 (10th Ed.2014). A common but restricted definition of \u201cprison\u201d is as a \u201cstate or federal facility of confinement for convicted criminals, esp. felons.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1387. In contrast, \u201cjail\u201d is defined as \u201c[a] prison; esp. a local government\u2019s detention center where persons awaiting trial or those convicted of misdemeanors are confined.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 962.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">{\u00b6 41} The Ohio General Assembly has defined \u201cprison\u201d for purposes of R.C. Chapter 2929, which governs penalties and sentencing, as \u201ca residential facility used for the confinement of convicted felony offenders that is under the control of the department of rehabilitation and correction.\u201d R.C. 2929.01(AA). In contrast, a \u201cjail\u201d is defined as a facility used to confine alleged or convicted offenders that is operated by a political subdivision of the state, such as a county or municipality. R.C. 2929.01(R). Pursuant to R.C. 5120.10, the state director of rehabilitation and correction promulgates minimum standards for jails and the division of parole and community services investigates jails for compliance with the standards. But operation of the jails is left to the counties. R.C. 2929.01(R).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">{\u00b6 42} Thus there is no question that in Ohio, prisons and jails are distinct. Prisons are state-run facilities and jails are operated by counties. But the IAD did not use the terms \u201cprison\u201d and \u201cjail.\u201d The critical question of whether a county jail is a \u201cpenal or correctional institution of the state\u201d requires further analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">{\u00b6 43} Relying on the Fifth Edition of <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, Escalanti </em>held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>A \u201cpenal institution\u201d is a \u201cgeneric term to describe all places of confinement for those convicted of crime such as jails, prisons, and houses of correction.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1020 (5th ed. 1979). A \u201ccorrectional institution\u201d is a \u201cgeneric term describing prisons, jails, reformatories and other places of correction and detention.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 311.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">165 Ariz. at 387, 799 P.2d 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">{\u00b6 44} But the Fifth Edition of <em>Black\u2019s </em>was not published until 1979, after the IAD was drafted. And earlier versions of <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, </em>including the version that was effective when the IAD was adopted by Congress and in Ohio, do not contain definitions of \u201cpenal institution\u201d or \u201ccorrectional institution.\u201d <em>See Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>(4th Rev.Ed.1968) and (3d Ed.1933).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">{\u00b6 45} Because the term \u201cpenal or correctional institution\u201d is not defined in the statute and because there is little guidance available regarding the common, ordinary, and accepted meaning of the term, it is reasonably susceptible to more than one interpretation, as demonstrated by the split of jurisdictions on this issue. Thus, we find that the meaning of \u201cpenal or correctional institution,\u201d as used in the IAD, is ambiguous. Accordingly, we look to other sources to determine the meaning of the phrase in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-9\">{\u00b6 46} The United States Supreme Court has held that interpretation of the IAD is a question of federal law subject to federal construction because the statute is a congressionally sanctioned interstate compact. <em>Carchman, </em>473 U.S. at 719, 105 S.Ct. 3401, 87 L.Ed.2d 516; <em>Cuyler, </em>449 U.S. at 438-442, 101 S.Ct. 703, 66 L.Ed.2d 641.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-10\">{\u00b6 47} Federal courts have uniformly held that the IAD applies only to prisoners who have begun serving their sentence of imprisonment and not to detainees who are awaiting the disposition of their proceedings because, in part, pretrial detainees do not yet have an interest in rehabilitation programs. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Dobson, </em>585 F.2d 55, 59 (3d Cir.1978) (noting that various federal and state courts have declined to extend the IAD to pretrial detainees); <em>United States v. Roberts, </em>548 F.2d 665, 671 (6th Cir.1977) (holding that the IAD did not apply to a pretrial detainee who had not yet begun his term of imprisonment). Courts are split, however, regarding whether the IAD applies to prisoners who have been sentenced but remain in temporary custody awaiting transfer to the facility where they will serve their sentence. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Taylor, </em>173 F.3d 538, 541 (6th Cir.1999) (holding that the IAD was not triggered after sentencing until the prisoner was transferred to the state facility in which he would be serving his sentence); <em>Runck v. State, </em>497 N.W.2d 74, 81 (N.D.1993) (noting a split among jurisdictions whether the IAD applies to a prisoner remaining in temporary custody after sentencing); <em>compare State v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number><em>Springer, </em>406 S.W.3d 526, 538 (Tenn.2013) (holding that a term of imprisonment under the IAD \u201cbegins when a prisoner is sentenced and confined\u201d regardless of the nature of the facility in which he or she is located when invoking the IAD).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">{\u00b6 48} New federal cases have addressed whether a jail is a \u201cpenal or correctional institution\u201d for purposes of the IAD, and none are directly on point here. <em>See Walton, </em>167 P.3d at 166 (\u201cWe have found no federal case addressing specifically whether a jail is a \u2018penal or correctional institution\u2019 under the IAD when it is the facility to which a defendant is ordered to serve his or her sentence\u201d). <em>See also United States v. Evans, </em>W.D.Va. No. l:08cr00024-006, 2008 WL 3834089, *3, 2008 U.S. Dist.

Charity, </em>7th Dist. Mahoning No. 12 MA 214, 2013-Ohio-5385, 2013 WL 6499452, \u00b6 21 (holding that \u201c[a] county jail is not a \u2018correctional institution of this state\u2019 \u201d for purposes of R.C. 2941.401); <em>State v. Barr, </em>11th Dist. Portage No. 2008-P-0031, 2009-Ohio-1146, 2009 WL 653803, \u00b6 37-38 (holding that R.C. 2941.401 does not apply to a prisoner in a county jail and that a county jail is not a correctional institution under the statute); <em>State v. Siniard, </em>6th Dist. Huron No. H-03-008, 2004-Ohio-1043, 2004 WL 413328, \u00b6 9 (holding that R.C. 2941.401 does not apply to an accused held in county jail rather than a state prison); <em>Newark v. Barcus, </em>5th Dist. Licking No. 94 CA 00015, 1994 WL 590498, *2 (Sept. 29, 1994) (holding that R.C. 2941.401 applies only to prisoners in a state facility and not to those in a county jail).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">{\u00b6 50} We might find our appellate courts\u2019 interpretation of the language in R.C. 2941.401 instructive to the interpretation of similar language in the IAD if the IAD governed procedures for inmates housed only in Ohio. But the IAD also applies to those imprisoned <em>outside </em>Ohio seeking to dispose of charges pending here. Thus, Ohio\u2019s correctional system is not the governing consideration and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>interpretation of the IAD consistent with Ohio\u2019s speedy-trial statute is neither helpful nor practical.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">{\u00b6 51} To demonstrate this point, if application of the IAD were limited to prisoners in state prisons and did not apply to those incarcerated in county jails, Ohio prosecutors who received requests from out-of-state prisoners for disposition of charges under the IAD would not be able to take advantage of Ohio\u2019s settled distinction between jails and prisons. Instead, the prosecutor would have to inquire whether the out-of-state prisoner is housed in a'jail or prison or some type of facility covered by the IAD and also whether that state applies the IAD to inmates in jails. Such a result does not further the purpose of the IAD to facilitate state-to-state transfers to expedite disposition of detainers. \u201cBecause the IAD is a uniform act, officials who receive IAD disposition requests from out-of-state inmates should not be required to research or guess whether the other state treats its jails as \u2018penal or correctional institutions.\u2019 \u201d <em>Walton, </em>167 P.3d at 166.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">{\u00b6 52} We find the reasoning of the court of appeals\u2019 decision in this case and those decisions with holdings similar to it to be persuasive. For example, in <em>Escalanti, </em>the Arizona court found no language in the IAD expressly limiting its application to state-run facilities and therefore concluded that for the purposes of the IAD, there is no difference between a county jail and a state prison except the \u201csign on the building.\u201d 165 Ariz. at 387, 799 P.2d 5. In <em>Springer, </em>the Supreme Court of Tennessee noted that a sentence in Tennessee could be served in a county jail or a state prison, and therefore, applying the IAD to any prisoner serving his or her sentence regardless of location \u201cprovides a consistent bright line rule for courts to follow, and it effectuates the intent of the legislature in adopting the IAD.\u201d 406 S.W.3d at 538.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">{\u00b6 53} The Sixth Circuit noted that rehabilitative programs are \u201c \u2018not normally available at a facility or jail designed for temporary custody of prisoners.\u2019 \u201d <em>Taylor, </em>173 F.3d at 541, quoting <em>Runck v. State, </em>497 N.W.2d 74, 81 (N.D.1993). But this differs from state to state. Thus, relying on the nature of the facility and whether it offers rehabilitative programs to limit the meaning of the statutory language is not useful. In fact, the unsuitability of relying on the nature of the facility has led to the \u201cwidely accepted view that a prisoner\u2019s operative rights under the Act arise once the prisoner begins serving a term of imprisonment.\u201d <em>Felix v. United States, </em>508 A.2d 101, 106 (D.C.App.1986).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-8\">Different jurisdictions maintain various types of correctional institutions and different administrative procedures for both incarcerating a prisoner and instituting that prisoner\u2019s rehabilitation program. Uncertainty would be created if every time an IAD claim was raised [a] court was required to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>examine an individual prisoner\u2019s rehabilitative status within a particular state correctional system.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">{\u00b6 54} The IAD specifically mandates that the \u201cagreement shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate its purposes.\u201d R.C. 2963.30, Article IX. The dual purposes of the statute \u2014 expeditious and orderly disposition of detainers filed in other jurisdictions and cooperative procedures for inmate transfers \u2014 are best furthered by a broad application of the IAD to any prisoner serving his or her sentence regardless of the facility in which that sentence is being served. Accordingly, we conclude that the term \u201cpenal or correctional institution of a party state\u201d in R.C. 2963.30 can encompass a county jail as well as a state prison or correctional facility so long as the prisoner has begun serving his or her sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">{\u00b6 55} We recognize that although many states share our analysis, other states apply the IAD to inmates only in state facilities and not in county jails. However, any lack of uniformity with other states resulting from our decision is not an issue that this court can resolve. And, our holding, of course, is limited in precedential effect only to Ohio courts.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b482-8\">{\u00b6 56} The uniformity we accomplish here is to resolve the conflict between our appellate courts by interpreting the intent of the General Assembly in enacting the IAD with the purpose of providing guidance to state authorities and any defendant with charges pending here. In the absence of uniform federal guidance on the present issue, we must interpret the language of R.C. 2963.30 to effectuate the intent of the General Assembly in adopting the IAD.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-9\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b482-10\">{\u00b6 57} We agree that the better-reasoned approach is that taken by the Fifth District Court of Appeals. We therefore answer the certified question as follows: the term \u201cpenal or correctional institution of a party state,\u201d as used in R.C. 2963.30, includes a county jail as well as a state prison or correctional facility. Accordingly, we affirm the Fifth District Court of Appeals\u2019 judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-11\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b482-12\">Pfeifer, Lanzinger, French, and O\u2019Neill, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"AUk-\">O\u2019Donnell and Kennedy, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b480-8\">.

Unlike the majority, I do not believe that this term includes county jails. The plain language of the IAD, as codified in the statute, establishes that the term \u201cpenal or correctional institution of a party state\u201d refers to a state penal or correctional institution.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-8\">Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b483-9\">{\u00b6 60} On August 2, 2010, in case No. 10-CRI-080, Ashland County issued an indictment charging James D. Black with theft and breaking and entering, and it issued a warrant for his arrest. At the time of this indictment, Maryland authorities held Black in a county jail where he awaited sentencing for other crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-10\">{\u00b6 61} On January 27, 2011, Black submitted a notice of availability to the Ashland County trial court and provided a copy of the notice to the Ashland County prosecutor. The prosecutor responded, suggesting that the notice of availability was premature because Black had not been serving any sentence and had not been incarcerated in a state penal institution.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-11\">{\u00b6 62} In February 2011, Black began serving a one-year sentence in a county detention center in Maryland. The following month, with the assistance of the administrator of the detention center, Black took steps pursuant to R.C. 2963.30 to dispose of the Ashland County charges and other charges filed against him in Richland and Franklin Counties.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-12\">{\u00b6 63} In April 2011, the Richland County prosecutor\u2019s office arranged to transfer Black from Maryland to resolve charges in that county. The next month, Maryland authorities sent Black to Richland County.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-13\">{\u00b6 64} On July 8, 2011, Richland County deputy sheriffs brought Black to Ashland County for arraignment. At the arraignment hearing, with the agreement of the parties, the Ashland County trial court set a trial date for October 11, 2011. It ordered that Black \u201cremain in the custody of the Ashland County Jail during the pendency of this matter, unless otherwise removed pursuant to warrant for Richland County\u2019s purposes,\u201d but later modified this order to temporarily return Black to Richland County. After the arraignment hearing, Richland County deputy sheriffs brought Black to Richland County, where on July 19, 2011, pursuant to a guilty plea, a trial court convicted him of felony tampering with evidence. At some point, the state also resolved the Franklin County charges against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>{\u00b6 65} On August 1, 2011, Richland County authorities sent Black to Maryland. Three weeks after his return to Maryland \u2014 on August 22, 2011 \u2014 Black moved to dismiss the Ashland County case, asserting a violation of his speedy-trial rights due to a failure to prosecute him in accordance with R.C. 2963.30. The trial court denied this motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">{\u00b6 66} According to Black, his Maryland sentence ended on September 11, 2011, he refused extradition to Ohio, and he remained in a Maryland county detention center until December 2011, when a Maryland judge permitted him to post bond for his release. On December 6, 2011, the Ashland County trial court stated that Black had appeared before it. However, on December 30, 2011, he failed to appear at another pretrial hearing. At that hearing, when the trial court inquired about Black\u2019s whereabouts, his counsel stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-6\">I don\u2019t know. My last conversation with Mr. Black, he was still in Maryland, and I believe due to his anger over the Motion to Dismiss not being granted, he stated, as I related to the Court, he will not come back voluntarily for this trial * * *.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">The trial court issued an arrest warrant. Black later represented to the trial court that on December 12, 2011, he had been arrested in Medina County on an outstanding misdemeanor charge and held in that county until his transfer to Ashland County.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-8\">{\u00b6 67} In January 2012, the state offered a plea agreement to Black, informing him that if he did not accept the agreement, it intended to re-indict him on additional charges. Black refused the state\u2019s offer and refiled his August 22, 2011 motion to dismiss as an amended motion to dismiss, which the trial court denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-9\">{\u00b6 68} On January 26, 2012, in Ashland County Court of Common Pleas case No. 12-CRI-010, an Ashland County grand jury indicted Black, charging him with two counts of felony theft, one count of felony breaking and entering, and one count of felony burglary. On February 3, 2012, Black moved to dismiss, arguing that the state had failed to prosecute him within the time required by R.C. 2963.30. After holding a hearing, the trial court denied his motion, holding that R.C. 2963.30 did not apply, because Black was incarcerated in an out-of-state county detention facility instead of a state penal or correctional institution. It also dismissed case No. 10-CRI-80.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-10\">{\u00b6 69} The state again amended the indictment, charging Black with two counts of misdemeanor theft and one count of felony burglary. The matter proceeded to trial, and a jury found Black guilty of the misdemeanor theft charges and one felony count of breaking and entering as a lesser included <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>offense of burglary. The trial court convicted him and imposed an aggregate 12-month prison term.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">{\u00b6 70} Black appealed to the Fifth District Court of Appeals, arguing that he had been tried in violation of R.C. 2963.30. 2013-Ohio-976, 989 N.E.2d 151, \u00b6 12 (5th Dist.). The court of appeals reversed the trial court\u2019s judgment, holding that R.C. 2963.30 applied to offenders held in county jails as well as in state penal or correctional facilities. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 27, 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">{\u00b6 71} The state appealed to this court and presented a judgment from the Fifth District Court of Appeals that certified that its decision in <em>Black </em>conflicted with a decision in <em>State v. Wyer, </em>8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 82962, 2003-Ohio-6926, 2003 WL 22976573.

Article I sets forth the purpose of the agreement, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-9\">The party states find that charges outstanding against a prisoner, detainers based on untried indictments, informations or complaints, and difficulties in securing speedy trials of persons already incarcerated in other jurisdictions, produce uncertainties which obstruct programs of prisoner treatment and rehabilitation.

The party states also find that proceedings with reference to such charges and detainers, when emanating from another jurisdiction, cannot properly be had in the absence of cooperative procedures. It is the further purpose of this agreement to provide such cooperative procedures.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">{\u00b6 74} Article III establishes a prisoner-initiated procedure in which a prisoner against whom a detainer has been lodged may be transferred to the custody of a receiving state.

In <em>Cuyler, </em>the United States Supreme Court stated that Article III of the IAD</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-5\">requires the warden to notify the prisoner of all outstanding detainers and then to inform him of his right to request final disposition of the criminal charges underlying those detainers. If the prisoner initiates the transfer by demanding disposition (which under the Agreement automatically extends to <em>all </em>pending charges in the receiving State), the authorities in the receiving State must bring him to trial within 180 days or the charges will be dismissed with prejudice, absent good cause shown.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">(Emphasis sic.) <em>Id. </em>at 444.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">{\u00b6 75} Notably, the term \u201cpenal or correctional institution of a party state\u201d\u2014 the term at issue here \u2014 occurs only in Article 111(a) of R.C. 2963.30. Article 111(a) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-8\">Whenever a person has entered upon a term of imprisonment in a <em>penal or correctional institution of a party state, </em>and whenever during the continuance of the term of imprisonment there is pending in any other party state any untried indictment, information or complaint on the basis of which a detainer has been lodged against the prisoner, he shall be brought to trial within one hundred eighty days after he shall have caused to be delivered to the prosecuting officer and the appropriate court of the prosecuting officer\u2019s jurisdiction written notice of the place of his imprisonment and his request for a final disposition to be made of the indictment, information or complaint: provided that for good cause shown in open court, the prisoner or his counsel being present, the court having jurisdiction of the matter may grant any necessary or reasonable continuance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">{\u00b6 76} The meaning of the term \u201cpenal or correctional institution of a party state\u201d in Article 111(a) presents a question of statutory construction and interpretation. In <em>State v. Hairston, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 308, 2004-Ohio-969, 804 N.E.2d 471, \u00b6 11-12, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-7\">\u201cThe object of judicial investigation in the construction of a statute is to ascertain and give effect to the intent of the law-making body which enacted it.\u201d <em>Slingluff v. Weaver </em>(1902), 66 Ohio St. 621, 64 N.E. 574, paragraph one of the syllabus. This court may engage in statutory interpretation when the statute under review is ambiguous. Id.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-8\">\u201cBut the intent of the law-makers is to be sought first of all in the language employed, and if the words be free from ambiguity and doubt, and express plainly, clearly and distinctly, the sense of the law-making body, there is no occasion to resort to other means of interpretation. The question is not what did the general assembly intend to enact, but what is the meaning of that which it did enact. That body should be held to mean what it has plainly expressed, and hence no room is left for construction.\u201d Id. at paragraph two of the syllabus.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-9\">{\u00b6 77} In Article 111(a), R.C. 2963.30, the General Assembly used the prepositional phrase \u201cof a party state\u201d to modify \u201cpenal or correctional institution,\u201d thereby indicating that the penal or correctional institution belongs to, relates to, or is connected with the state. A plain reading of Ohio\u2019s version of Article 111(a) shows that a penal or correctional facility of a political subdivision is not included within its scope.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-10\">{\u00b6 78} If the General Assembly intended for a penal or correctional facility of a political subdivision to be included within the scope of Article 111(a), it could have used language to show this intent. It did not. <em>Compare </em>Md.Code Ann., Corr.Servs., 8 \u2014 401(d) (definitional section of Maryland\u2019s version of the LAD) (\u201c \u2018Correctional institution\u2019 means, with reference to the correctional institutions of this State, any State or local correctional facility\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-11\">{\u00b6 79} Neither did the legislature include language in R.C. 2963.30, Article II\u2014 a definitional article \u2014 indicating that the term \u201cstate\u201d includes a political subdivision of a state. Article II of R.C. 2963.30 provides: \u201cAs used in this agreement: (a) \u2018State\u2019 shall mean a state of the United States!;] the United States of America!;] a territory or possession of the United States!;] the District of Columbia!;] the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>{\u00b6 80} Among the purposes of the IAD is the avoidance- of disruptions to prisoner treatment and rehabilitation. <em>See </em>R.C. 2963.30, Article I. Generally speaking, in Ohio, prisoner treatment and rehabilitation occur in state correctional institutions. For example, pursuant to R.C. 5120.032(A), the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction (\u201cODRC\u201d) is authorized to develop and implement \u201cintensive program prisons\u201d that \u201cfocus on educational achievement, vocational training, alcohol and other drug abuse treatment, community service and conservation work, and other intensive regimens or combinations of intensive regimens.\u201d And in R.C. 5120.033, the General Assembly authorized the ODRC to develop and implement intensive program prisons for certain offenders of statutes prohibiting the operating of a motor vehicle while impaired.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">{\u00b6 81} By comparison, in Ohio, a jail is a facility established by a municipal legislative authority wherein persons convicted and sentenced for misdemeanors may be kept subject to the minimum standards for jails promulgated by the ODRC. R.C. 753.03.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">{\u00b6 82} Notably, in <em>State v. Wade, </em>105 Nev. 206, 209-210, 772 P.2d 1291 (1989), the Nevada Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-7\">[W]e believe that for purposes of permitting a defendant to invoke Article III(a)\u2019s provisions there is a significant distinction between jails and state prisons. * * * While the definition of prison arguably includes jails, as a practical matter jails are designed only for short-term detention and punishment, not rehabilitation. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-8\">The very programs of prisoner treatment and rehabilitation whose obstruction the IAD was intended to prevent are not present in jails.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b488-9\">And in <em>Dorsey v. State, </em>490 N.E.2d 260, 264 (Ind.1986), <em>overruled on other grounds, Wright v. State, </em>658 N.E.2d 563 (Ind.1995), the Indiana Supreme Court reached a similar conclusion, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-10\">The purpose of [the IAD] is to encourage the expeditious and orderly disposition of charges outstanding against a prisoner because outstanding charges create uncertainties which obstruct the prisoner\u2019s treatment and rehabilitation programs. The act was intended to benefit persons serving time in prison.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b488-11\">The structures described in <em>Wade </em>and <em>Dorsey </em>are consistent with Ohio\u2019s structure of its correctional system and support a determination that the term \u201cpenal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>or correctional institution of a party state\u201d in Article 111(a), as codified in R.C. 2963.30, does not include a county jail.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AQD\">Ramona J. Rogers, Ashland County Prosecuting Attorney, and Andrew N. Bush and Emily M. Bates, Assistant Prosecuting Attorneys, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AMu\">Poplar &amp; Mason, L.L.C., and Daniel D. Mason, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">{\u00b6 83} Accordingly, the plain language of R.C. 2963.30, Articles II and 111(a), confirms that the term \u201cpenal or correctional institution of a party state\u201d means a state prison or correctional facility \u2014 not a county jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">{\u00b6 84} The plain language of R.C. 2963.30, Article 111(a), establishes that the term \u201cpenal or correctional institution of a party state\u201d refers to a state penal or correctional institution. I would reverse the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<judges id=\"b489-8\">Kennedy, J., concurs in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
