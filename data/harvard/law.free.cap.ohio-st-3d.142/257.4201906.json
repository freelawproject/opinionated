Specifically, we are asked to determine whether foreseeability of the risk of harm is a factor that must always be considered when determining a medical professional\u2019s duties or if it is an irrelevant factor that may never be considered when determining a medical professional\u2019s duties. We hold that it is neither.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">{\u00b6 2} Foreseeability is generally relevant to a determination of whether a physician has exercised reasonable care in understanding or determining the existence of a risk of harm associated with a particular course of treatment. But when the parties do not dispute that a physician conducted a risk-benefit analysis prior to treating a patient and do not dispute that the physician understood that the chosen course of treatment carried some risk of harm, a jury instruction regarding the foreseeability of harm need not be given. However, the instruction would not be patently prejudicial, and the judgment is not subject to reversal absent a showing of material prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">{\u00b6 3} Under the facts of this case, the trial court\u2019s decision to provide a superfluous instruction to the jury on foreseeability was not prejudicial error. We therefore reverse the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">Relevant Background</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">{\u00b6 4} This medical-negligence action arose from the death of Seth Niles Cromer at the pediatric intensive-care unit (\u201cPICU\u201d) of Children\u2019s Hospital Medical Center of Akron. Melinda Cromer, Seth\u2019s mother, and Roderick Cromer Jr., Seth\u2019s father, individually and as administrator, brought an action against the hospital, alleging that Seth\u2019s death was caused by the combined and individual negligence of multiple hospital employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-9\">\n<em>The Treatment Provided</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b396-10\">{\u00b6 5} Much of the evidence was disputed at trial. But it was shown that Seth\u2019s parents took him to the hospital\u2019s emergency room at approximately 10:44 p.m. on Saturday, January 13, 2007, after Seth, who had been treated earlier in the week for an ear infection, became very ill. At triage, Seth\u2019s symptoms and vital signs included an elevated pulse and rate of respiration, a tender abdomen with pressure, pale skin, normal temperature, and normal blood pressure. Seth\u2019s condition was assessed as urgent, and upon further examination by emergency-room doctors, Seth was diagnosed as suffering from shock. At approximately 11:30 p.m., the attending emergency-room physician, Brett Luxmore, D.O., ordered the administration of oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids, and intravenous antibiotics. Because Seth\u2019s blood pressure had lowered and was unstable by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>time Dr. Luxmore assessed him, Dr. Luxmore also ordered the administration of epinephrine in an attempt to raise the blood pressure.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">{\u00b6 6} Initial blood tests, taken at midnight, indicated that Seth was suffering from metabolic acidosis, which means that his blood was not delivering adequate oxygen to his tissues. But he was not suffering from respiratory acidosis, which would have meant that his blood was accumulating carbon dioxide. Around 12:30 a.m. on January 14, 2007, the amount of oxygen in Seth\u2019s blood rose to a normal level. His blood pressure improved as well, albeit due to the continuous administration of a high dose of epinephrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">{\u00b6 7} While Seth was being transferred from the emergency room to PICU around 1:10 a.m., his condition worsened. It was later discovered that the carbon-dioxide levels in Seth\u2019s blood had begun to rise. The attending PICU physician, Richard Wendorf, M.D., (1) inserted a central-venous-access catheter in Seth\u2019s femoral vein for the instant administration of medication and fluids as well as for rapid assessment of blood-gas levels and fluid balance, (2) inserted an arterial catheter in Seth\u2019s femoral artery for continuous real-time monitoring of blood pressure, and then (3) inserted a tube into Seth\u2019s trachea to decrease the heart\u2019s burden and facilitate ventilation. Dr. Wendorf completed these procedures by 1:46 a.m., 2:00 a.m., and 2:15 a.m., respectively. Seth\u2019s condition improved until approximately 3:35 a.m., at which point his blood pressure dropped precipitously and he went into cardiac arrest. Seth died soon after.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">\n<em>The Cromers\u2019 Expert Testimony</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">{\u00b6 8} The Cromers\u2019 expert, Margaret Parker, M.D., agreed that the interventions and treatment that the emergency-room and PICU physicians had ordered were appropriate. However, she did not agree that the timing of the interventions and treatment, particularly intubation, was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">{\u00b6 9} Dr. Parker testified that the longer shock is allowed to progress, the harder the strain on the heart, and the harder it is to reverse the problem. Dr. Parker explained that intubation helps to increase blood oxygenation, decrease carbon dioxide levels, and decrease the energy spent on breathing. Dr. Parker testified that the standard of care for medical professionals would mandate immediate intubation upon discovering evidence of severe metabolic and respiratory acidosis. Dr. Parker opined that Seth\u2019s respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute and the blood-test results delivered at 12:19 a.m. were clear evidence of severe metabolic and respiratory acidosis. Dr. Parker concluded that the hospital employees deviated from the standard of care by not intubating Seth until two hours later.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-9\">{\u00b6 10} Specifically, Dr. Parker testified that Dr. Luxmore breached the standard of care by not intubating Seth in the emergency room by 12:30 a.m. and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>Dr. Wendorf breached the standard of care by not intubating Seth immediately upon his arrival at the PICU. However, Dr. Parker later testified that Dr. Wendorf s decision to place a central venous line prior to intubation was within the standard of care. Dr. Parker also agreed that both doctors considered the risks of both immediate and delayed intubation prior to deciding to implement their particular courses of action. But she did not agree that the doctors appropriately weighed the risks and benefits and did not agree that their clinical judgments regarding the timing of intubation were reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">\n<em>The Hospital\u2019s Expert Testimony</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">{\u00b6 11} Dr. Luxmore acknowledged that shock is a life-threatening condition that can lead to death if not properly treated. Dr. Luxmore testified that although intubation could decrease the levels of carbon dioxide in the blood and decrease the strain on a patient\u2019s heart, that benefit must be weighed against the risk of causing a sudden drop in blood pressure and cardiac arrest. Because Seth\u2019s blood pressure was tenuous but he otherwise had a stable airway and his circulatory system was not building up carbon dioxide while he was in the emergency room, Dr. Luxmore decided that the benefit of intubation at that time was outweighed by the risk that Seth would not survive the process of intubation.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">{\u00b6 12} One of the hospital\u2019s experts, Robert Kennedy, M.D., explained that the sedation required to intubate a patient could cause blood pressure to bottom out completely. Dr. Kennedy testified that although intubation would be important in the long run to decrease the strain on the patient, other measures to stabilize the patient take priority in the emergency department if the patient is able to breathe. Dr. Kennedy opined that Dr. Luxmore complied with the standard of care when he decided not to intubate Seth in the emergency department given that Seth\u2019s blood circulation required intervention and his carbon-dioxide levels were normal.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">{\u00b6 13} Dr. Wendorf testified that he knew right away that he was going to intubate Seth due to the risk that Seth\u2019s condition would worsen, but that immediate intubation without taking certain precautions would have been unnecessarily risky in light of-Seth\u2019s precarious condition. Another expert, Douglas Wilson, M.D., testified that the importance of relieving the strain on a patient\u2019s cardiovascular system must be weighed against the risk of inducing cardiac arrest. Dr. Wilson opined that Dr. Wendorf understood the risks and benefits involved and weighed them appropriately in reaching his decision on the sequence of placing catheters and intubating Seth.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-9\">\n<em>The Jury Instructions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b398-10\">{\u00b6 14} After the close of evidence, the parties discussed their proposed jury instructions with the court. Many of the parties\u2019 proposed instructions incorpo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>rated standard language from the Ohio Jury Instructions outlining the elements of medical negligence and applicable standard of care. However, the hospital also requested an instruction on the foreseeability of harm using language from the general negligence provisions of the Ohio Jury Instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">{\u00b6 15} The Cromers objected to the instruction, arguing that an instruction to the jury on foreseeability is required only in a regular negligence claim and is not part of the Ohio Jury Instructions for medical negligence. The Cromers further argued that the instruction was not supported by the evidence, because there was no testimony that the doctors did not know that the failure to appropriately treat a patient in shock could lead to death. The trial court ultimately instructed the jury on the elements of negligence as they applied to the hospital and its employees and gave an instruction on foreseeability that asked the jury to determine whether the hospital employees should have foreseen that Seth\u2019s death was a likely result of their actions or failure to act.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">\n<em>The Verdict</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">{\u00b6 16} At the end of its charge, the trial court provided general verdict forms and multiple interrogatories to the jury. The first interrogatory asked whether the hospital had been negligent. Another interrogatory asked whether the hospital\u2019s negligence was a direct and proximate cause of Seth Cromer\u2019s death. The trial court explained that if the jury\u2019s answer to the first interrogatory was \u201cno,\u201d then its deliberations were complete.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">{\u00b6 17} After the jury completed its deliberations, the trial court reviewed the forms and noted that the jury had answered \u201cno\u201d on both the negligence and causation interrogatories. The trial court stated that although it would not have been necessary to complete the interrogatory on proximate causation, the jury\u2019s answer was consistent with the interrogatory on negligence. The trial court polled the jury, provided the interrogatories to counsel, and upon receiving no objection, excused the jury. The trial court accordingly entered judgment in favor of Children\u2019s Hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">\n<em>The Posttrial Proceedings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b399-9\">{\u00b6 18} The Cromers moved for a new trial, arguing that the verdict was against the manifest weight of the evidence and that the interrogatories finding both no negligence and no causation were in conflict. They also claimed that there were multiple errors in the jury instructions and that the jury\u2019s completion of the causation interrogatory constituted a clear sign that the erroneous instructions led the jury to an improper application of the law. The trial court denied the motion, stating that although the jury did not follow the court\u2019s instruction that deliberations would be complete upon a finding that negligence was not shown, the interrogatories were consistent with one another and with the general verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>{\u00b6 19} The Cromers appealed, arguing that the trial court committed reversible error by including an instruction on foreseeability when it instructed the jury on the hospital\u2019s standard of care. The Cromers additionally argued that the verdict was against the manifest weight of the evidence and that the trial court had erroneously denied their motion for a new trial. And as primary support for their arguments, the Cromers pointed to the jury\u2019s unnecessary completion of the causation interrogatory as confirmation that the jury had misunderstood the law and applied the instructions in a way that led to an erroneous result. The Cromers further contended that the fact that the jury found no causation did not render harmless any error in its finding regarding negligence, because once the jury had determined that there was no negligence, a finding of no causation was a logical impossibility. The appellate court found merit in the Cromers\u2019 jury-instruction argument and reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">{\u00b6 20} Central to the appellate court\u2019s holding was its determination that the question of foreseeability of harm was irrelevant to a determination of a medical professional\u2019s standard of care. 2012-Ohio-5154, 985 N.E.2d 548, \u00b6 27. Specifically, the court held that a physician\u2019s duty is established by the physician-patient relationship alone with no consideration of foreseeability. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 24. The court concluded that the trial court\u2019s instruction on the foreseeability of the risk of harm during medical treatment constituted an incorrect statement of law that required reversal. <em>Id. </em>Finally, the appellate court stated that it could not conclude that the error was rendered harmless by the jury\u2019s decision to answer the interrogatory on causation. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 25. Accordingly, the court held that reversal and a remand for a new trial were required. Because the appellate court\u2019s holding disposed of the appeal, the Cromers\u2019 remaining arguments were rendered moot and were not addressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">{\u00b6 21} The cause is now before this court upon our acceptance of a discretionary appeal to determine the propriety of including a foreseeability instruction when instructing a jury on the standard of care for medical professionals. 134 Ohio St.3d 1484, 2013-Ohio-902, 984 N.E.2d 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">\n<em>Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b400-9\">{\u00b6 22} A trial court is obligated to provide jury instructions that correctly and completely state the law. <em>Sharp v. Norfolk &amp; W. Ry. Co., </em>72 Ohio St.3d 307, 312, 649 N.E.2d 1219 (1995). The jury instructions must also be warranted by the evidence presented in a case. <em>Estate of Hall v. Akron Gen. Med. Ctr., </em>125 Ohio St.3d 300, 2010-Ohio-1041, 927 N.E.2d 1112, \u00b6 26. The question of whether a jury instruction is legally correct and factually warranted is subject to de novo review. <em>Id. </em>We begin our de novo review by examining whether a correct statement of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>the law regarding medical negligence includes consideration of the foreseeability of a risk of harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">\n<em>Relevance of Foreseeability in a Medical-Negligence Claim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">{\u00b6 23} In general, a cause of action for negligence requires proof of (1) a duty requiring the defendant to conform to a certain standard of conduct, (2) breach of that duty, (3) a causal connection between the breach and injury, and (4) damages. <em>See Menifee v. Ohio Welding Products, Inc., </em>15 Ohio St.3d 75, 77, 472 N.E.2d 707 (1984). The elements are the same for medical negligence. <em>Loudin v. Radiology &amp; Imaging Servs., Inc., </em>128 Ohio St.3d 555, 2011-Ohio-1817, 948 N.E.2d 944, \u00b6 13. Only the elements relating to duty are at issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">{\u00b6 24} The concept of foreseeability is an important part of all negligence claims, because \u201c[t]he existence of a duty depends on the foreseeability of the injury.\u201d <em>Menifee </em>at 77. As a society, we expect people to exercise reasonable precautions against the risks that a reasonably prudent person would anticipate. <em>Commerce &amp; Industry Ins. Co. v. Toledo, </em>45 Ohio St.3d 96, 98, 543 N.E.2d 1188 (1989). Conversely, we do not expect people to guard against risks that the reasonable person would not foresee. <em>Menifee </em>at 77; Keeton, Dobbs, Keeton &amp; Owen, <em>Prosser and Keeton on the Law of Torts, </em>Section 43, 280 (5th Ed.1984). The foreseeability of the risk of harm is not affected by the magnitude, severity, or exact probability of a particular harm, but instead by the question of whether <em>some </em>risk of harm would be foreseeable to the reasonably prudent person. <em>See Gedeon v. E. Ohio Gas Co., </em>128 Ohio St. 335, 339, 190 N.E. 924 (1934). Accordingly, the existence and scope of a person\u2019s legal duty is determined by the reasonably foreseeable, general risk of harm that is involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">{\u00b6 25} The existence of an actor\u2019s duty to another person usually arises from the foreseeability of injury to someone in that other person\u2019s \u201cgeneral situation.\u201d <em>Gedeon </em>at 339. But there are also certain legally recognized relationships between parties that can establish the existence of an actor\u2019s duty to another person. <em>Estates of Morgan v. Fairfield Family Counseling Ctr., 77 </em>Ohio St.3d 284, 293, 673 N.E.2d 1311 (1997). The relationship between medical professionals and their patients is one of those legally recognized relationships. <em>Loumsbury v. VanBuren, </em>94 Ohio St.3d 231, 235, 762 N.E.2d 354 (2002). The physician-patient relationship arises from an express or implied contract between the physician and patient and imposes on the physician a fiduciary duty to exercise good faith. <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Tracy v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., </em>58 Ohio St.3d 147, 150, 569 N.E.2d 875 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">{\u00b6 26} In the context of an established physician-patient relationship, there is no need to independently determine whether the patient falls within the class of people who could foreseeably be injured, because the existence of the physician\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>duty to that patient is already clear. To this extent, the appellate court accurately held that foreseeability is irrelevant to a determination of a physician\u2019s duty. 2012-Ohio-5154, 985 N.E.2d 548, at \u00b6 22. But the foreseeability of one\u2019s duty to a particular person does not necessarily determine the foreseeability of a risk of harm, and it therefore does not end the inquiry into the scope of an actor\u2019s duty to another person.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">{\u00b6 27} The scope of any duty owed is the standard of care that an actor must exercise. <em>Commerce &amp; Industry Ins. Co. </em>at 98; <em>Berdyck v. Shinde, </em>66 Ohio St.3d 573, 578, 613 N.E.2d 1014 (1993). The minimum standard of care expected under any circumstances is to exercise that degree of care and caution that an ordinarily careful and prudent person would exercise under similar circumstances. <em>Gedeon </em>at 338. In the physician-patient relationship, however, the scope of the duty owed includes an augmented expectation that physicians will exercise the degree of care that is reasonable in light of the physician\u2019s superior training and knowledge. <em>Berdyck </em>at 579. Thus, the standard of care applicable to medical professionals is to exercise the degree of care that a medical professional of ordinary skill, care, and diligence would exercise under similar circumstances. <em>Bruni v. Tatsumi, </em>46 Ohio St.2d 127, 346 N.E.2d 673 (1976), at paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">{\u00b6 28} Although the standard of care for a medical professional is heightened, it does not necessarily supplant all consideration of foreseeability. As part of their standard of care, medical professionals are expected to be able to recognize certain symptoms of illness and injury, and they are expected to be aware of the associated risk of harm. <em>See Berdyck </em>at 581 (obstetrical staff nurses are expected to recognize symptoms of major obstetrical complications and take appropriate action to prevent harm). In other words, they are expected to foresee a risk of harm that a medical professional of ordinary skill, care, and diligence would foresee under similar circumstances. And just as with the general negligence standard, it necessarily follows that we would not expect medical professionals to guard against a risk of harm that a medical professional of ordinary skill, care, and diligence would not foresee. <em>See, e.g., Keebler v. Winfield Carraway Hosp., </em>531 So.2d 841, 844-845 (Ala.1988), citing <em>Fernandez v. Baruch, </em>52 N.J. 127, 244 A.2d 109 (1968) (explaining that a physician does not have a duty to take measures to prevent a patient from committing suicide if the patient\u2019s suicide was not reasonably foreseeable under generally accepted medical standards). Accordingly, foreseeability of harm is relevant to a physician\u2019s standard of care, and a correct, general statement of the law regarding the standard of care or the breach of that standard includes the element of foreseeability.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>{\u00b6 29} Because foreseeability of harm is relevant to the determination of the scope of a physician\u2019s duty in a medical-malpractice action, giving a foreseeability instruction in such an action is not manifestly incorrect, and the appellate court\u2019s conclusion to the contrary was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">{\u00b6 30} Having clarified the general question of law, we next consider the instruction in light of the facts of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">\n<em>Factual Propriety of Including a Foreseeability Instruction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">{\u00b6 31} Foreseeability of harm usually does not enter into the analysis of medical negligence, not because it is legally -irrelevant, but because it is almost always factually undisputed that a risk of harm was foreseeable and that the medical professional was aware that the chosen course of treatment involved a risk of harm. <em>See, e.g., Beard v. Meridia Huron Hosp., </em>106 Ohio St.3d 237, 2005-Ohio-4787, 834 N.E.2d 323, \u00b6 30-31 (whether postsurgieal infection was a foreseeable risk of performing an invasive surgery was not disputed); <em>Hubach v. Cole, </em>133 Ohio St. 137, 139, 12 N.E.2d 283 (1938) (risk of burns from radium treatment was foreseen). Instead, in the more common line of cases, the pertinent question is whether the medical professional acted unreasonably in the face of those risks. <em>See, e.g., Branch v. Cleveland Clinic Found., </em>134 Ohio St.3d 114, 2012-Ohio-5345, 980 N.E.2d 970, \u00b6 27 (relevant inquiry was whether \u201cdifferent planning and procedures could have prevented the stroke,\u201d not whether brain injury was foreseeable); <em>Beard </em>(relevant dispute was whether the physician reasonably assessed the likelihood and magnitude of a patient\u2019s risk of infection, not whether infection was foreseeable); <em>Hier v. Stites, </em>91 Ohio St. 127, 128, 110 N.E. 252 (1914) (relevant inquiry was only whether failure to sterilize equipment and cleanse wound breached the physician\u2019s standard of care, not whether infection was foreseeable). Such is the case here.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">{\u00b6 32} In this case, the treating physicians were not accused of failing to foresee that the negative effects of the progression of shock and the strain on a patient\u2019s cardiovascular system were risks of delaying the intubation of a patient in shock. They admitted to having knowledge of these risks and weighing them against the risks and benefits of performing other precautionary measures prior to intubation. Thus, the parties did not dispute that the treating physicians foresaw that there was a risk of harm associated with their choice of emergency treatment. Instead, they debated whether the physicians reasonably appreciated the magnitude of the risk and properly weighed it in their risk-benefit analyses. Accordingly, the question remaining was whether the physicians\u2019 chosen course of treatment was reasonable in light of the risks.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-9\">{\u00b6 33} We have long held that a trial court should limit its instructions to the jury to matters actually raised in the pleadings and in the evidence at trial. <em>Becker v. Lake Cty. Mem. Hosp. W., </em>53 Ohio St.3d 202, 208, 560 N.E.2d 165 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>(1990), citing <em>Hood v. New York, Chicago &amp; St. Louis Ry. Co., </em>166 Ohio St. 529, 144 N.E.2d 104 (1957), paragraph four of the syllabus. \u201cAbstract rules of law or general propositions, even though correct, ought not to be given unless specifically applicable to facts in issue.\u201d <em>State v. Guster, </em>66 Ohio St.2d 266, 271, 421 N.E.2d 157 (1981). Even if an instruction is related to facts in evidence, an instruction that draws attention to irrelevant issues may be objectionable. <em>Masci v. Keller, </em>18 Ohio St.2d 67, 247 N.E.2d 457 (1969) (instructing a jury that it may find in favor of the \u201cdefendants,\u201d including the claimant\u2019s employer, was incorrect because it was irrelevant to the only question in the case, which was whether the claimant was entitled to participate in the State Insurance Fund).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">{\u00b6 34} There was no question for the jury in this case regarding the foreseeability of the risk of harm because the medical professionals were aware that their chosen chronology of treatment of Seth\u2019s shock carried with it some risk of harm. Thus, the instruction regarding the foreseeability of harm was not necessary in light of the facts and arguments presented in this case. We next consider the potential effect of the unnecessary instruction on the Cromers\u2019 case.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">\n<em>Propriety of Jury Instructions as a Whole</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AGF\">{\u00b6 35} An unnecessary, ambiguous, or even affirmatively erroneous portion of a jury charge does not inevitably constitute reversible error. <em>See Becker, </em>53 Ohio St.3d at 208, 560 N.E.2d 165. If there is no inherent prejudice in the inclusion of a particular jury instruction, prejudice must be affirmatively shown on the face of the record, and it cannot be presumed. <em>Wagner v. Roche Laboratories, </em>85 Ohio St.3d 457, 461-462, 709 N.E.2d 162 (1999). \u201cIn examining errors in a jury instruction, a reviewing court must consider the jury charge as a whole and \u2018must determine whether the jury charge probably misled the jury in a matter materially affecting the complaining party\u2019s substantial rights.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kokitka v. Ford Motor Co., </em>73 Ohio St.3d 89, 93, 652 N.E.2d 671 (1995), quoting <em>Becker </em>at 208. If the complete set of instructions by the trial court otherwise fairly and correctly lays out the relevant law, and if it is apparent in the context of the complete instructions that an isolated error did not prejudice a party\u2019s substantial rights, reversal on the error is not warranted. <em>Centrello v. Basky, </em>164 Ohio St. 41, 128 N.E.2d 80 (1955), paragraph eight of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">{\u00b6 36} The general rule is that an erroneous instruction does not necessarily mislead a jury. <em>See Cleveland Elec. Illum. Co. v. Astorhurst Land Co., </em>18 Ohio St.3d 268, 274-275, 480 N.E.2d 794 (1985). The same rule applies in a medical-malpractice case. <em>See Hayward v. Summa Health Sys./Akron City Hosp., </em>139 Ohio St.3d 238, 2014-Ohio-1913, 11 N.E.3d 243, \u00b6 33.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b405-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>{\u00b6 37} In <em>Cleveland Elec. Illum. Co., </em>the trial court erroneously instructed the jury that eight rather than nine members of a 12-member jury needed to agree upon the verdict. Although nine jurors signed the verdict form, one of those nine later averred that he had not agreed with the verdict but had signed the form because he believed that his vote was purely academic. <em>Id. </em>at 273-274. We rejected the argument that the trial court\u2019s erroneous instruction necessarily rendered the verdict invalid. Instead, we held that the question was whether the instruction itself was so misleading that it could have directly induced an erroneous verdict. <em>Id. </em>at 274, quoting <em>Long v. Cassiero, </em>105 Ohio St. 123, 136 N.E. 888 (1922). We noted that the trial court had instructed the jurors to sign the form only if they concurred in the verdict and had not indicated that any juror should sign the form \u201c(a) after eight other jurors had signed it, or (b) when it became \u2018academic\u2019 for him to refuse to do so.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 275. Because the inaccurate instruction could not have induced the ninth juror to vote against his true intent, there was no showing of prejudicial error. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\">{\u00b6 38} In <em>Hayward, </em>the trial court provided an erroneous instruction regarding remote causation in a medical-negligence action, but the only alleged evidence of juror confusion was the fact that the jury had completed separate interrogatories finding no causation despite having already found that the defendant was not negligent. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 22. Because the interrogatories were consistent with the general verdict, and because the erroneous instruction did not induce the jurors to complete the mooted interrogatories, we held that no prejudice was shown from the instruction itself. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 32. Accordingly, in order to demonstrate reversible error, there must be a connection between the allegedly erroneous jury instruction and the alleged evidence of juror confusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">{\u00b6 39} In the present case, the jury instruction found to constitute reversible error by the court of appeals stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-6\">In deciding whether ordinary care was used, you will consider whether the defendant should have foreseen under the attending circumstances that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>the natural and probable result of an act or failure to act would cause Seth Cromer\u2019s death.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-4\">The test for foreseeability is not whether the defendant should have foreseen the death of Seth Cromer precisely as it happened. The test is whether under all the circumstances a reasonably cautious, careful, prudent person would have anticipated that death was likely to result to someone from the act or failure to act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-5\">If the defendant by the use of ordinary care should have foreseen the death and should not have acted, or if they did act, should have taken precautions to avoid the result, the performance of the act or the failure to act to take such precautions is negligence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">This foreseeability instruction was drawn from <em>Ohio Jury Instructions, </em>CY Section 401.07(1) (Rev. May 12, 2012), which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-7\">1. General. In deciding whether (reasonable) (ordinary) care was used, you will consider whether the defendant(s) should have foreseen under the circumstances that the likely result of an act or failure to act would cause (injuries) (damages).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-8\">2. Test. The test for foreseeability is not whether a person should have foreseen the (injuries) (damages) exactly as it happened to the specific (person) (property). The test is whether under the circumstances a reasonably careful person would have anticipated that an act or failure to act would likely (result in) (cause) (injuries) (damages).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-9\">{\u00b6 40} We note that the issue of foreseeability of harm, if factually relevant in a medical-negligence case, would have to be considered in the context of \u201crecognized standards * * * provided through expert testimony,\u201d just like any other element of a medical-negligence claim. <em>Bruni v. Tatsumi, </em>46 Ohio St.2d at 131\u2014 132, 346 N.E.2d 673. When assessing the actions of a medical professional, it would be inappropriate to view foreseeability in terms of a layperson\u2019s \u201cordinary\u201d standard of care. For that reason, it would be preferable for OJI to include in its medical-specific jury instructions a foreseeability instruction that incorporates the specific standard of the reasonable medical professional rather than the reasonable person. However, because the instructions in the present case repeatedly defined \u201creasonable\u201d and \u201cordinary care\u201d solely in the context of a \u201creasonable hospital,\u201d a \u201creasonably careful physician,\u201d and \u201chospitals, physicians and/or nurses of ordinary skill, care and diligence,\u201d the jury instructions regarding the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>applicable standard of care, as a whole, were not misleading. <em>See Youngstown Mun. Ry. Co. v. Mikula, </em>131 Ohio St. 17, 20,1 N.E.2d 135 (1936).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">{\u00b6 41} Regardless, the appellate court\u2019s determination of error in this case was based not on particular word choices in the trial court\u2019s foreseeability instruction, but on the inclusion of the concept of foreseeability, as a whole, in jury instructions on medical negligence. And by requiring reversal based on the trial court\u2019s mere inclusion of a foreseeability instruction, the appellate court erroneously presumed that the error was prejudicial<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> instead of determining whether there was a clear indication on the face of the record that the instruction prejudiced the Cromers\u2019 substantial rights. <em>Wagner, </em>85 Ohio St.3d at 461-462, 709 N.E.2d 162.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">{\u00b6 42} The only manifestation of the jury being misled by the foreseeability instruction that was identified to the appellate court was that the jurors completed the interrogatory regarding proximate cause instead of stopping after finding that negligence had not occurred. But similarly to <em>Cleveland Elec. Illum. Co. </em>and <em>Hayward, </em>we see no connection between an unnecessary foreseeability instruction and the jurors\u2019 decision to complete the interrogatory for the mooted issue of causation after completing the interrogatory for the primary issue of negligence. Thus, some other showing from the record would be necessary to establish that the instruction led the jury to an erroneous result in this case. However, none was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">{\u00b6 43} The jury\u2019s answers to the negligence and the causation interrogatories, both in favor of the defense, were not inconsistent with one another, nor were they inconsistent with the general verdict. Further, in contrast to the manifestly erroneous instruction in <em>Cleveland Elec. Illum. Co. </em>and the factually unsupported instruction in <em>Hayward, </em>the foreseeability instruction in this case was drawn from the actual facts presented, but was mere surplusage. Accordingly, the record in this case does not establish that the unneeded jury instruction on foreseeability prejudiced the Cromers\u2019 substantial rights, and the appellate court\u2019s reversal was not justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b407-9\">{\u00b6 44} In the context of an established physician-patient relationship, consideration of foreseeability is unnecessary to the determination whether the patient is someone to whom the physician owes a duty of care. But the issue of foreseeability is relevant to a physician\u2019s standard of care in treating a particular patient, and separate consideration of the foreseeability of harm is appropriate if there is a question for the jury regarding whether the physician knew or should have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>known that a chosen course of treatment involved a risk of harm. However, in most medical-negligence cases, including this one, the foreseeability of a risk of harm related to the medical treatment is conceded, leaving no need for a jury instruction on foreseeability.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">{\u00b6 45} Further, a jury instruction on a general rule of law, even if correct, should not be given if the instruction is not applicable to the evidence presented. But the inclusion of an unnecessary instruction does not constitute reversible error absent a showing of material prejudice. Because such a showing was not provided in this case, the appellate court should not have disturbed the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">{\u00b6 46} We therefore reverse the judgment of the court of appeals. We remand the cause to the appellate court to consider the Cromers\u2019 assignments of error regarding the manifest weight of the evidence and the failure to grant the motion for a new trial, which the appellate court previously held were mooted by its disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b408-7\">Lanzinger, French, and O\u2019Neill, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b408-8\">O\u2019Donnell and Kennedy, JJ., concur in judgment only.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b408-9\">Pfeifer, J., dissents.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b404-8\">. The above-described standards for finding prejudice in an erroneous jury instruction are well settled, and we declined jurisdiction over the hospital\u2019s assertion that the appellate court failed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>apply these standards correctly. This court generally declines to entertain issues that do not involve a question of great general or public interest, such as ones that request resolution of an individual case rather than resolution of the law. Ohio Constitution, Article IV, Section 2(e); S.Ct.Prac.R. 7.08(B)(4)(b). But in order to fully determine whether the appellate court\u2019s dispositional order for a new trial should be affirmed or reversed based on the issue currently under our review, we must answer the secondary, implicit issue of prejudice. <em>See Belvedere Condominium Unit Owners\u2019 Assn. v. R.E. Roark Cos., Inc., </em>67 Ohio St.3d 274, 279, 617 N.E.2d 1075 (1993). And because correction of the alleged error readily comes from our review of the entire record, we are able to resolve this issue without receiving additional briefing on the already settled law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b407-10\">. Contrary to the position taken in the dissenting opinion, the appellate court\u2019s discussion of whether the proximate-cause interrogatory rendered the error harmless did not somehow cure the appellate court's failure to find prejudice on the face of the record in the first place.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b408-10\">O\u2019Donnell, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AOM\">concurring in judgment only.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-11\">{\u00b6 47} This appeal raises two issues: first, whether the trial court in this medical malpractice action erred in instructing the jury on the concept of foreseeability applicable to an ordinary negligence claim, and second, whether that instruction probably misled the jury and resulted in an erroneous verdict. Because the court\u2019s instructions did not accurately charge the jury on the applicable law, and because the court of appeals failed in the first instance to determine whether the erroneous instructions probably misled the jury and resulted in an erroneous verdict, I concur in the court\u2019s judgment to reverse and remand the matter for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-12\">{\u00b6 48} A cause of action for negligence requires the claimant to prove \u201cthe existence of a duty, a breach of that duty, and an injury resulting proximately therefrom.\u201d <em>Menifee v. Ohio Welding Prods., Inc., </em>15 Ohio St.3d 75, 77, 472 N.E.2d 707 (1984). In ordinary negligence cases, we have stated that \u201c[t]he existence of a duty depends on the foreseeability of the injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>And as we explained in <em>Menifee, </em>\u201c[t]he test for foreseeability is whether a reasonably prudent person would have anticipated that an injury was likely to result from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>the performance or nonperformance of an act.\u201d <em>Id. See also Gedeon v. E. Ohio Gas Co., </em>128 Ohio St. 335, 338, 190 N.E. 924 (1934) (\u201cNo one is bound to take care to prevent consequences which, in the light of human experience, are beyond the range of probability\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\">{\u00b6 49} But in medical malpractice cases, we have not generally used the concept of foreseeability to define the duty that a medical provider owes to a patient. Rather, in <em>Bruni v. Tatsumi, </em>46 Ohio St.2d 127, 129, 346 N.E.2d 673 (1976), we set forth the test for evaluating the conduct of a physician or surgeon charged with malpractice as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-5\">whether the physician, in the performance of his service, either did some particular thing or things that physicians and surgeons, in that medical community, of ordinary skill, care and diligence would not have done under the same or similar circumstances, or failed or omitted to do some particular thing or things which physicians and surgeons of ordinary skill, care and diligence would have done under the same or similar circumstances.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">{\u00b6 50} We also have relied on the concept of foreseeability in determining whether the negligent act proximately caused the injury. <em>See, e.g., Mussivand v. David, </em>45 Ohio St.3d 314, 321, 544 N.E.2d 265 (1989) (\u201cin order to establish proximate cause, foreseeability must be found\u201d); <em>Strother v. Hutchinson, </em>67 Ohio St.2d 282, 287, 423 N.E.2d 467 (1981) (\u201ca reasonable foreseeability of injury is considered an element of proximate cause\u201d). As we explained in <em>Gedeon, </em>\u201cThe law, in determining liability for harm done, refuses to follow the logical chain of causation beyond what it regards as the direct or proximate cause.\u201d 128 Ohio St. at 339, 190 N.E. 924. Thus, it is not enough that the negligent act is a cause-in-fact of the injury, but the injury must also be \u201c \u2018the natural and probable consequence\u2019 \u201d of the negligent act, that is, \u201c \u2018it must appear that the injury complained of could have been foreseen or reasonably anticipated from the alleged negligent act.\u2019 \u201d <em>Strother </em>at 287, quoting <em>Ross v. Nutt, </em>177 Ohio St. 113, 114, 203 N.E.2d 118 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">{\u00b6 51} Here, the trial court erred in giving the jury instruction on foreseeability. First, there is no question that the medical professionals treating Seth owed him a duty of reasonable care arising from the doctor-patient relationship, nor is it disputed that the injury complained of could have been reasonably anticipated from the allegedly negligent acts. Any foreseeability of harm to Seth was therefore not at issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">{\u00b6 52} Second, and more importantly, the trial court\u2019s instruction on foreseeability fundamentally misstated the standard of care applicable in medical mal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>practice cases. The court framed its foreseeability instructions in terms of a layperson\u2019s ability to anticipate that death would likely result from an act or a failure to act by the hospital\u2019s medical professionals. But a reasonable layperson considering the circumstances in this case \u2014 in which a child presents to an emergency department suffering from an ear infection and dehydration \u2014 lacks the necessary knowledge, training, and experience to appreciate whether or not the child\u2019s death was likely to result. Rather, the question is whether the hospital\u2019s medical professionals \u201cemploy[ed] that degree of skill, care and diligence that a physician or surgeon of the same medical specialty would employ in like circumstances.\u201d <em>Berdyck v. Shinde, </em>66 Ohio St.3d 573, 579, 613 N.E.2d 1014 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">{\u00b6 53} The trial court compounded this error by stating the foreseeability instruction in terms of probability. Although the reasonable person in an ordinary negligence case may be required to anticipate only those injuries that are <em>likely to result </em>from a course of conduct, a doctor is charged with possessing the specialized knowledge and experience of the medical profession and therefore is required to anticipate diagnoses that may be unlikely or rare. As one treatise explains, \u201cIt is the object of diagnostic effort to identify the disease responsible for the patient\u2019s present syndrome. Thus, the ultimate step in differential diagnosis consists of selecting from <em>a number of possibilities </em>the disease or diseases that come nearest to explaining the clinical and laboratory finding in the case in question.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 1 Pegalis, <em>American Law of Medical Malpractice 3d, </em>Section 3:12, at 231 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">{\u00b6 54} In effect, the trial court informed the jury that the hospital\u2019s doctors had a duty to foresee and treat only those diseases that appeared more likely than not to cause Seth\u2019s illness, regardless of whether a reasonable medical professional in the same specialty under like circumstances would have correctly diagnosed and treated the condition from which he suffered. The Supreme Court of Georgia in <em>Smith v. Finch, </em>285 Ga. 709, 681 S.E.2d 147 (2009), recently concluded that a similar instruction charging the jury in a medical malpractice action that \u201c \u2018[n]egligence consists of not foreseeing and guarding against that which is probable and likely to happen, not against that which is only remotely and slightly possible\u2019 \u201d was inaccurate and misleading, because it directed the jury that it could not find negligence in the failure to diagnose a relatively rare but severe disease. <em>Id. </em>at 710-711, quoting 1 <em>Suggested Pattern Jury Instructions: Civil Cases, </em>Section 62.311 (4th Ed.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">{\u00b6 55} For these reasons, the instruction the trial court gave on foreseeability is erroneous, and I see no need to provide an advisory opinion speculating on when an instruction on foreseeability might be appropriate in charging the jury on the standard of care for medical professionals.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>{\u00b6 56} Erroneous jury instructions rise to reversible error only if \u201cthe jury charge was so misleading and prejudicial as to result in an erroneous verdict.\u201d <em>Hayward v. Summa Health Sys./Akron City Hosp., </em>139 Ohio St.3d 238, 2014-Ohio-1913, 11 N.E.3d 243, \u00b6 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">{\u00b6 57} Here, the majority\u2019s analysis is based on a mistaken reading of the Ninth District\u2019s decision; the majority asserts that \u201cthe appellate court erroneously presumed that the error was prejudicial,\u201d majority opinion at \u00b6 41, and that \u201c[t]he only manifestation of the jury being misled by the foreseeability instruction that was identified to the appellate court was that the jurors completed the interrogatory regarding proximate cause instead of stopping after finding that negligence had not occurred,\u201d <em>id. </em>at \u00b6 42. It is true that there is \u201cno connection between an unnecessary foreseeability instruction and the jurors\u2019 decision to complete the interrogatory for the mooted issue of causation,\u201d majority opinion at \u00b6 42, but the court of appeals drew no such connection and did not find prejudice simply because the jury failed to comply with the trial court\u2019s instruction not to answer the interrogatory on proximate cause if it found that the hospital had not been negligent. The appellate court addressed only whether the erroneous instruction could be deemed harmless based on the jury\u2019s additional finding that the hospital\u2019s negligence had not proximately caused Seth\u2019s death, such that the Cromers would have failed to prove their cause of action notwithstanding the erroneous instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">{\u00b6 58} In fact, the court of appeals did not consider whether the jury instructions, taken as a whole, probably misled the jury, and it provided little analysis in support of its conclusion that the trial court committed reversible error. But as we recently explained in <em>Hayward, </em>an appellate court \u201c \u2018will not assume the presence of prejudice * * * but must find prejudice on the face of the record.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hayward </em>at \u00b6 26, quoting <em>Wagner v. Roche Laboratories, </em>85 Ohio St.3d 457, 462, 709 N.E.2d 162 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">{\u00b6 59} Accordingly, I would reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and remand the matter for a determination whether the jury instructions, taken as a whole, probably misled the jury and resulted in an erroneous verdict in this case. I therefore concur in the majority\u2019s judgment, but not its reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">Kennedy, J., concurs in the foregoing opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b411-9\">Pfeifer, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Aa4\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b411-11\">{\u00b6 60} The majority holds that the appellate court correctly held that the trial court erred in including a jury instruction on foreseeability, but concludes that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>the appellate court failed to show that the jury instructions materially prejudiced the Cromers. The majority opinion is weighted with syllabus paragraphs, but all the syllabus paragraphs in the world cannot change the fact that the sole, unremarkable holding of this case is that the appellate court did not do enough to show that the jury instructions it correctly held were erroneous were prejudicial. But here is the rub: that issue is not before this court. This court specifically refused jurisdiction on the following proposition of law offered by the appellant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-5\">A verdict may not be reversed for a claimed error in the jury instructions where the jury instruction, as a whole, properly explained the applicable law, and where there has been no demonstration that the jury was <em>probably </em>misled by the allegedly erroneous instruction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">(Emphasis sic.) <em>See </em>134 Ohio St.3d 1484, 2013-Ohio-902, 984 N.E.2d 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">{\u00b6 61} The appellant had argued in that proposition of law that even if the foreseeability instruction was wrong, the trial court\u2019s instructions as a whole did not mislead the jury. By refusing to accept that proposition of law, this court let stand the court of appeals\u2019 determination of prejudice. This court accepted jurisdiction on only the following proposition of law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-8\">Foreseeability is a vital and important factor for a jury to consider in determining whether a medical defendant has acted as a reasonably prudent medical provider under the same or similar circumstances. Thus, a trial court should instruct jurors in medical malpractice cases on the issue of foreseeability.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-9\"><em>See id. </em>Thus, the only issue before this court is whether the appellate court correctly held that the trial court had erred in giving an instruction on foreseeability to the jury. The parties have every reason to believe that this appeal would be resolved upon a determination of only that legal issue. The resolution of that issue in favor of the appellees should end this case and lead to an affirmance of the appellate court. Instead, the majority moves on to an issue not briefed by the parties \u2014 not briefed at the specific instruction of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-10\">{\u00b6 62} This case turns on an issue the appellees never had a chance to address. The majority opinion misleadingly states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-11\">The only manifestation of the jury being misled by the foreseeability instruction that was identified to the appellate court was that the jurors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>completed the interrogatory regarding proximate cause instead of stopping after finding that negligence had not occurred.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">Majority opinion at \u00b6 42. The Cromers have made no such argument in <em>this </em>court because they did not need to. Through its refusal to accept jurisdiction on the issue of prejudice, this court declared the issue settled. But the majority ignores this court\u2019s earlier, gateway determination and instead determines the case on the issue it refused to consider.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">{\u00b6 63} Even if the issue of whether the jury instruction was prejudicial were properly before this court, the majority\u2019s analysis is wrong. The appellate court did address prejudice. It held that <em>even though </em>the jurors answered the proximate-cause interrogatory in favor of the hospital \u2014 that its negligence was not the proximate cause of Seth\u2019s death \u2014 the foreseeability instruction was still prejudicial. The court of appeals addressed the argument that the instruction on negligence was harmless error because the jury \u2014 regardless of its finding on negligence \u2014 had found a lack of proximate cause. The court pointed out that the instruction on proximate cause was premised on whether the hospital\u2019s <em>negligence </em>had caused Seth\u2019s death and that the trial court\u2019s instruction on negligence had tainted the jury\u2019s finding on proximate cause. Thus, despite an answer to the interrogatory in favor of the hospital on proximate cause, the court held that \u201cwe cannot conclude that the trial court\u2019s improper instruction on the hospital\u2019s standard of care did not affect the ultimate outcome in this case.\u201d 2012-Ohio-5154, 985 N.E.2d 548, \u00b6 26 (9th Dist.). Certainly, the appellate court properly demonstrated that prejudice sufficient to reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment existed by demonstrating that the trial court\u2019s faulty jury instruction on negligence compromised even the jury\u2019s finding on proximate cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-8\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b413-9\">{\u00b6 64} Further, that the foreseeability jury instruction was prejudicial is apparent on its face. Let us revisit the jury instruction at issue, which the nonunanimous jury (the vote was 6-2 in favor of the defendant) took into the jury room:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-10\">In deciding whether ordinary care was used, you will consider whether the defendant should have foreseen under the attending circumstances that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>the natural and probable result of an act or failure to act would cause Seth Cromer\u2019s death.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-5\">The test for foreseeability is not whether the defendant should have foreseen the death of Seth Cromer precisely as it happened. The test is whether under all the circumstances a reasonably cautious, careful, prudent person would have anticipated that death was likely to result to someone from the act or failure to act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-6\">If the defendant by the use of ordinary care should have foreseen the death and should not have acted, or if they did act, should have taken precautions to avoid the result, the performance of the act or the failure to act to take such precautions is negligence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">{\u00b6 65} The instruction placed the treating doctors in the position of laymen \u2014 \u201ca reasonably cautious, careful, prudent person\u201d \u2014 and required them to have anticipated that Seth\u2019s death was the likely result of their failure to act. Not that an extended illness or an increased hospital stay might have resulted, but death. Would a reasonably prudent person believe that a basically healthy five-year-old child would likely die during a trip to the emergency room? No \u2014 because no one wants to believe that that is possible, let alone likely.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">{\u00b6 66} Because of the foreseeability jury instruction, the incomprehensible tragedy of Seth\u2019s death inures to the benefit of the hospital. A \u201creasonably cautious, careful, prudent, person\u201d would never expect that a little boy with an earache and stomachache could be dead in a matter of hours. Certainly, anyone who could have anticipated that his or her care would result in the death of a child would have approached the child\u2019s treatment differently.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-9\">{\u00b6 67} The inclusion of the foreseeability instruction prejudiced the Cromers by allowing the jury to consider the treating doctors not as clinicians bound to perform their jobs within certain standards, but as laymen dealing with the unthinkable, heartbreaking death of a young child.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-10\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b414-11\">{\u00b6 68} This court accepted this case pursuant to its authority under Article IV, Section 2(B)(2)(e) of the Ohio Constitution as a \u201ccase[ ] of public or great general interest.\u201d It is neither. It is of like kind with <em>Branch v. Cleveland Clinic Found., </em>134 Ohio St.3d 114, 2012-Ohio-5345, 980 N.E.2d 970, and <em>Hayward v. Summa Health Sys./Akron City Hosp., </em>139 Ohio St.3d 238, 2014-Ohio-1913, 11 N.E.3d 243, error-correction cases without meaningful holdings that reversed appellate-court reversals of defense verdicts in medical-malpractice cases. But this case is worse; there is no error to correct that is properly before this court. At least in <em>Summa, </em>this court accepted jurisdiction to answer the question of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>whether the trial court\u2019s error was prejudicial, and in <em>Branch, </em>it accepted jurisdiction to determine whether the trial court had abused its discretion on certain evidentiary and jury-instruction decisions. Here, the majority decides the case on an issue over which it expressly disclaimed jurisdiction. That it decides that issue wrongly is to be expected.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AGN\">Hanna, Campbell &amp; Powell, L.L.P., Gregory T. Rossi, and Rocco D.
