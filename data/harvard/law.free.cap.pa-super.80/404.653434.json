Her daughter, Gertrude Estelle, survived her and has six children all of whom are living. Her will reads as follows: \u201cI wish my real estate kept in good repair, and I do not desire it to be sold during the life time of my daughter Gertrude Estelle Mayhew. I give and bequeath to my said daughter Gertrude Estelle Mayhew all my personal property and the interest of all real estate belonging to me, as long, as she lives, but if my said daughter Gertrude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>Estelle Mayhew should marry, then at her death the interest of my real estate goes to her issue. But in the event' of my daughter\u2019s death without issue all my property shall go to the Home for Destitute Colored Children, located at Marylandville, on the Darby Road. I appoint Messrs. William Burton Sloan, William Penn Johnson and Patrick Smith to be the executors and trustees of my will and guardians of my daughter during her minority. Philadelphia, January 6th, 1872.\u201d We are concerned only about the real estate for the personal property has been exhausted. Did the daughter take a life estate or does the rule in Shelley\u2019s Case apply? It will be observed that there are no technical words of limitation in the will such as \u201cheirs\u201d or \u201cheirs of the body,\u201d but the estate is limited to the \u201cissue\u201d of the daughter, and the decision depends upon what meaning we attach to the word \u201cissue.\u201d Did the testator use it as an equivalent to \u201cheirs of the body\u201d ? The court below in its opinion (Mayhew\u2019s Est., 1 D. &amp; C. R. 305) relies largely on English\u2019s Est., 270 Pa. 1. In that case Chief Justice Moschzisker after discussing the subject at some length and with reference to a number of cases concludes as follows: \u201cThe rule in Shelley\u2019s Case has become fixed in our law as more than a guide to construction \u2014 it is a rule of law; and every testator should know at this late day that, when technical words, such as \u2018heirs\u2019 or \u2018heirs of the body\u2019 are used, the rule applies (Stout v. Good, 245 Pa. 383, 385; Lee v. Sanson, 245 Pa. 392, 395; Harrison v. Harris, 245 Pa. 397, 400) just as though the writer of such expressions had said in plain words \u2018I give the devisee an estate in fee\u2019; but the word \u2018issue\u2019 in and of itself, never had such technical significance (Stout v. Good, 245 Pa. 383, 387), and now, that estates tail have ceased to exist in Pennsylvania (since the Act of 1855), there is no apparent reason why, in order to construe a devise into an estate tail, so that it may be held a fee, the word \u2018issue\u2019 should have a technical meaning forced on it for the purpose of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>bringing a devise within the rule of Shelley\u2019s Case. When a case naturally falls within that rule, it applies with all its attributes (Pattin v. Scott, 270 Pa. 49), but, as pointed out, the intention of the testator to indicate a line of inheritance from the devisee must be found in each case before the rule is applied; and, in ascertaining this intention, where the word \u2018issue\u2019 is used, the Act of 1897 [9 July. P. L. 213] as construed by this court, when it controls, sweeps away much old law and gives a plain guide for the future.\u201d See Mebus\u2019s Estate, 273 Pa. 505.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">Looking at the will before us we find that the gift of all interest of the real estate is to the daughter as long as she lives, \u201cthen at her death\u201d her interest was to pass to her issue, and if she had none, then to charity. The executors named are also denominated trustees and guardians. All this indicates that the corpus should pass to the remaindermen at the termination of the life estate. Numerous cases can be cited in which the word \u201cissue\u201d was construed to mean the same as the words \u201cheirs of the body,\u201d but in the construction of wills precedents are of little value, and there is no construction that \u201cwill not have many fellows in company to keep it in countenance\u201d: McCullough v. Fenton, 65 Pa. 418; Mulliken v. Earnshaw, 209 Pa. 226. Since the word \u201cissue\u201d has not the fixed meaning that \u201cheirs\u201d has, we are at' liberty to construe the will without having, as stated above, any technical meaning of the words forced upon us. We think the actual intention gathered from the language of this will was to give the daughter only a life estate and we, therefore, agree with the orphans\u2019, court that the word \u201cissue\u201d is not equivalent in this connection to the words \u201cheirs of the body\u201d and that the daughter did not take a fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">The assignments of error are overruled and the decree of the orphans\u2019 court is affirmed. Appellants to pay the costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
