The judgment creditor has appealed, contending that the evidence was insufficient to sustain the verdict and that binding instructions for it should have been given. The obstacle to our consideration of the questions sought to be raised is that appellant made no request in writing for binding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>instructions as required by the Act of April 22, 1905, P.
