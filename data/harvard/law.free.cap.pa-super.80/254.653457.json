Tbe first is whether plaintiff put before the jury in a proper way facts averred in the statement1 of claim and not denied in the affidavit of defense. We are of opinion that counsel for plaintiff substantially complied with the rule as recently stated by the Chief Justice in Buehler v. U. S. Fashion Plate Co., 269 Pa. 428, and followed in Farbo v. Caskey, 272 Pa. 573. As there pointed out, one of the three ways of proving facts so averred is, \u201cBy offering in evidence specific parts of the statement of claim, with what counsel conceive to be the replies thereto contained in the affidavit of defense, and having the facts thus sought to be established placed on the notes of trial as admitted, because averred in the statement and not denied in the affidavit of defense.\u201d In the case before us, certain paragraphs of the statement were offered in evidence in order. After reading paragraph one and offering it in evidence, plaintiff\u2019s counsel said: \u201cThat is admitted in the affidavit of defense.\u201d Defendant\u2019s counsel remarked: \u201cIt is admitted and explained.\u201d The court said: \u201cI will not permit the remainder of paragraph one of the affidavit of defense to go into evidence, because the only averment in paragraph one in the plaintiff\u2019s statement of claim is that the parties entered into a written contract of insurance, a correct copy of which is annexed to the statement of claim, and that is admitted by the affidavit of defense.\u201d Paragraph two was offered and read. This was followed by counsel\u2019s statement: \u201cParagraph two of the affidavit of defense says: \u2018Admitted.\u2019 \u201d The offer and reading of paragraphs three, four, five, seven, eight, nine and ten followed and without objection by counsel for defendant, the court said: \u201cThose offers in evidence are admitted.\u201d Counsel for defendant took an exception on the ground <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>that the affidavit of defense was not offered in evidence as required by the Supreme Court in Buehler v. U. S. Fashion Plate Co., supra. The only modification of the offers, which the strictest compliance with the opinion in that case suggests, would have been the offer ing of the words of the affidavit of defense which plaintiff\u2019s counsel conceived to be the replies to his offers. In this case it would have resulted in the offer of the word \u201cadmitted\u201d after the offer of each paragraph of the statement. Doubtless this would have been done by counsel for plaintiff or would have been required by the learned trial judge had counsel for defendant objected at the time the offers were made. We think, however, that what was done amounted to the same thing and was a substantial compliance with the practice outlined in Buehler v. U. S. Fashion Plate Co. No particular formality need be observed in offering the averments and admissions in evidence, so long as every purpose of the rule laid down by the Chief Justice has been served. Some latitude must be allowed the trial judge and counsel in following this rule and this court will not be hypercritical where the methods pointed out by the Chief Justice have been substantially followed, as they were here. The objection now raised appears to us without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-3\">The second question is whether defendant was entitled to judgment on the whole r\u00e9cord. The proceeding was interpleader to determine the right to the proceeds of a certificate issued by a beneficial association to William Henry Jameson. Plaintiff is the member\u2019s widow. Defendant is his son. At the trial the certificate was offered in evidence. It showed that the proceeds were payable to Mary Eliza Jameson, the first wife of William Henry Jameson. This was followed by proof of an agreement between the original association and certain other associations which succeeded it and took over its ^obligations. Under this agreement certificate holders became bound by the constitution and by-laws of the original organization. The constitution and by-laws <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>were placed in evidence. They provided that persons of certain classes may be designated by the member as beneficiary and that if the designation of the beneficiary shall fail, then the benefits are to be paid to the persons mentioned in the first class, section eleven, law one, in the shares and order of precedents as therein enumerated. The first class of beneficiaries comprises the wife or husband of a member, if living. In our case, the beneficiary named was the wife of the member. She died and the present plaintiff is the member\u2019s second wife. An examination of the evidence shows that plaintiff placed upon the record proofs consisting of documentary evidence and admissions, which warranted the direction of a verdict for plaintiff. The effect of the issue raised in that part of the affidavit of defense in which defendant sets up that he paid a large amount of money for premiums on the certificate at the request of his father, is not before us, as defendant produced no testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">For these reasons all the assignments of error are overruled, and the judgment of the court below is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
