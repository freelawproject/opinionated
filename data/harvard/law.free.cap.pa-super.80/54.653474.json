Defendant appeals and complains that his request for binding instructions and his motion for judgment n. o. v. were refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">Plaintiff averred he was employed by defendant, a contractor and builder. The employment was admitted but the parties differed as to its duties and compensation. The plaintiff alleged defendant agreed to pay him 30% of the net profits of the business during the period in dispute, and that1 thereby he was entitled to $6,123.74, of which he had received only $4,881.50, leaving due $1,242.24. The defense was that plaintiff was entitled to receive 30% of the difference, between the net profits and $4,881.50 which the plaintiff had already received; and that accordingly the plaintiff was overpaid $170.93.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">The only witnesses were the parties; their testimony supported their respective allegations, each contradicting the other in essentials; in such circumstances the court was bound to submit the evidence to the jury to find the facts. As there is evidence to support the verdict, defendant\u2019s motions were properly refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
