The IJ found that Garcia-Chavez was not credible and, in light of a prior voluntary departure to Mexico in lieu of deportation, he was ineligible for cancellation of removal because he had not met his burden of establishing ten years of continuous physical presence in the United States. The BIA determined that the IJ did not clearly err in finding Garcia-Chavez was not credible and that he had not established his eligibility for cancellation of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">We review the order of the BIA and will consider the underlying decision of the IJ to the extent that it influenced the BIA\u2019s decision. <em>Zhu v. Gonzales, </em>493 F.3d 588, 593 (5th Cir.2007). To establish eligibility for cancellation of removal, an alien must satisfy certain statutory requirements under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b). <em>Mireles-Valdez v. Ashcroft, </em>349 F.3d 213, 214 (5th Cir. 2003). One of the requirements is continuous physical presence in the United States for the ten-year period immediately preceding the date of the application for cancellation of removal. \u00a7 1229b(b)(l)(A). An alien\u2019s deportation or voluntary departure under threat of immigration proceedings stops the ten-year physical presence time period accrual. <em>Mireles-Valdez, </em>349 F.3d at 214, 217-19.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">In addition, we will defer to a credibility determination \u201cunless, from the totality of the circumstances, it is plain that no reasonable fact-finder could make such an adverse credibility ruling.\u201d <em>Wang v. Holder, </em>569 F.3d 531, 538 (5th Cir.2009) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). An adverse credibility determination must be supported \u201cby specific and cogent reasons derived from the record.\u201d <em>Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 339, 344 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">Garcia-Chavez admitted that, after he was detained in 2009, he signed certain documents agreeing that he would waive his right to an immigration hearing and would voluntarily return to Mexico. However, in the instant proceeding, he testified that he did not read these documents before signing them and that he was not informed that he was waiving his right to appear before an IJ. Garcia-Chavez\u2019s version of events is inconsistent with the representations on the signed documents and his stated practices and experience as a businessman. Thus, the IJ and BIA\u2019s adverse credibility determination was supported \u201cby specific and cogent reasons derived from the record.\u201d <em>Zhang, </em>432 F.3d at 344. Garcia-Chavez has not shown that, under \u201cthe totality of the circumstances, it is plain that no reasonable fact-finder could make such an adverse credibility ruling.\u201d <em>Wang, </em>569 F.3d at 538.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">The substantial evidence standard applies to factual determinations concerning an alien\u2019s claim of ten years of continuous presence. <em>Garcia-Melendez v. Ashcroft, </em>351 F.3d 657, 661 (5th Cir.2003). We will not reverse the BIA\u2019s decision \u201cunless the petitioner provides evidence so compelling that no reasonable fact-finder could conclude against it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Nothing in Garcia-Chavez\u2019s brief or in the record compels a finding that he was not granted a voluntary departure in lieu of deportation in 2009. In light of the adverse credibility finding, his contrary testimony was not \u201cso compelling that no reasonable fact-finder could conclude\u201d that the ten-year presence requirement was not interrupted. <em>Garcia-Melendez, </em>351 F.3d at 661.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">To the extent that Garcia-Chavez challenges the Id\u2019s determination that he was ineligible for voluntary departure, we lack jurisdiction to consider his arguments because the IJ alternatively declined to ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>ercise discretion to grant voluntary departure. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i); <em>Sattani v. Holder, </em>749 F.3d 368, 373 (5th Cir.2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">Accordingly, the petition for review is DENIED in part and DISMISSED in part for lack of jurisdiction. Garcia-Chavez\u2019s motion for leave to file an out-of-time reply brief is GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b233-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
