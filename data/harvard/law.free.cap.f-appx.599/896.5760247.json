The court also noted that, while Marshall referred to right-to-sue letters from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in the section of her complaint entitled \u201cExhaustion of Administrative Remedies,\u201d she did not include copies of those letters in the 20 pages of exhibits attached to her complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-4\">On appeal, Marshall argues that she sufficiently alleged exhaustion of her administrative remedies, that her complaint would not have been subject to dismissal if the court had granted her leave to file a seventh amended complaint severing her claims against non-moving defendants, and that the court overlooked information in her complaint that would have shown she stated claims against the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-5\">Upon a thorough review of the record, and after consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-6\">We review for an abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s exercise of its authority to dismiss an action under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(b) for failure to comply with court orders or federal rules. <em>Goforth v. Owens, </em>766 F.2d 1533, 1535 (11th Cir.1985). Dismissal with prejudice \u201cis considered a sanction of last resort, applicable only in extreme circumstances,\u201d where there is a \u201cclear record of delay or willful contempt and a finding that lesser sanctions would not suffice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). We have \u201crepeatedly held that an issue not raised in the district court and raised for the first time in an appeal will not be considered by this court.\u201d <em>Access Now, Inc. v. Sw. Airlines Co., </em>385 F.3d 1324, 1331 (11th Cir.2004) (quotations and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b936-8\">Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2), a complaint \u201cmust contain ... a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a)(2). Rule 8(a)(2)\u2019s purpose is to \u201cgive the defendant fair notice of what the claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.\u201d <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1964, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007) (citation and ellipsis omitted). Therefore, a complaint\u2019s \u201c[fjactual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level.\u201d <em>Id., </em>127 S.Ct. at 1965. Further, the allegations in the complaint \u201cmust be simple, concise, and direct.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(d)(1). Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 10 provides that the complaint also must \u201cstate its claims ... in numbered paragraphs, each limited as far as practicable to a single set of circumstances.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 10(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b936-9\">In contrast, a \u201cshotgun pleading\u201d is one in which \u201cit is virtually impossible to know which allegations of fact are intended to support which claim(s) for relief.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Dist. Bd. of Trs. of Ctr. Fla. Cmty. Coll., </em>77 F.3d 364, 366 (11th Cir. 1996). We have repeatedly condemned shotgun pleadings. <em>See, e.g., PVC Windoors, Inc. v. Babbitbay Beach Constr. N.V., </em>598 F.3d 802, 806 n. 4 (11th Cir.2010); <em>Davis v. Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Consol., </em>516 F.3d 955, 979 &amp; n. 54 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b936-10\">Where a more carefully drafted complaint might state a claim, a <em>pro se </em>plaintiff \u201cmust be given at least one chance to amend the complaint before the district court dismisses the action with prejudice.\u201d <em>Bryant v. Dupree, </em>252 F.3d 1161, 1163 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>(11th Cir.2001) (citation omitted). A district court, however, is not required to permit amendment if, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cthere has been ... repeated failure to cure deficiencies by amendments previously allowed\u201d or \u201camendment would be futile.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b937-7\">The district court \u201cmay properly on its own motion dismiss an action as to defendants who would have not moved to dismiss where such defendants are in a position similar to that of'moving defendants or where claims against such defendants are integrally related.\u201d <em>Loman Dev. Co., Inc. v. Daytona Hotel &amp; Motel Suppliers, Inc., </em>817 F.2d 1533, 1537 (11th Cir.1987) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b937-8\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing with prejudice Marshall\u2019s sixth amended complaint. Her complaint did not make a short and plain statement of her claims; instead, it was a shotgun pleading that made it impossible to know which allegations of fact were intended to support which claims of relief. Although the district court provided Marshall with numerous opportunities to file an amended complaint that complied with the court\u2019s orders and basic procedural rules, Marshall failed to cure the deficiencies in her complaint, despite the court\u2019s warnings that such a failure would result in dismissal with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-9\">Additionally, allowing Marshall another opportunity to amend her complaint would have been futile because her proposed seventh amended complaint would not have cured the deficiencies in her sixth amended complaint, but would have added only an additional demand for vicarious, joint, direct, and several liability. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"AiGQ\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b937-10\">. We DENY Marshall\u2019s motion to file a reply brief with excess words and DENY AS MOOT the Appellees\u2019 motion to strike Marshall\u2019s proposed reply brief.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
