Salas challenges the 12-level enhancement applied pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(iii) based on his conviction of a firearms offense. He contends that the district court erred by relying on the presentence report\u2019s characterization of the conviction as a firearms offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-22\">Because Salas faded to object to the enhancement in the district court, we review for plain error. <em>See United States v. Chavez-Hernandez, </em>671 F.3d 494, 497 (5th Cir.2012). On appeal, the government supplemented the record with copies of Salas\u2019s indictment, deferred adjudication order, and judicial confession from Salas\u2019s Texas conviction of possession of a short-barrel firearm. We examine state-court documents that have been added as a supplement to the record in determining whether the enhancement was properly applied. <em>United States v. Vargas-Soto, </em>700 F.3d 180, 183 (5th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-23\">Under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(iii), a defendant receives a 12-level enhancement for a firearms offense that is not assessed criminal history points. As relevant here, the commentary defines \u201cfirearms offense\u201d as \u201c[a]n offense under federal, state, or local law that prohibits the possession of a firearm described in 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5845(a).\u201d \u00a7 2L1.2, comment. (n.l(B)(v)(II)). Under \u00a7 5845(a), the definition of a \u201cfirearm\u201d includes a shotgun having a barrel or barrels under 18 inches in length. \u00a7 5845(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-24\">Salas\u2019s state-court indictment and the judicial confession show that the firearm was a shotgun with a barrel length of less than 18 inches. Because Salas was con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>victed of possessing a shotgun with a barrel length of less than 18 inches, there is no clear or obvious error in the application of the enhancement, so the district court did not plainly err. <em>See United States v. Diaz-Diaz, </em>827 F.3d 410, 414-15 (5th Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b174-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
