California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and <em>United States v. Flores, </em>632 F.3d 229 (5th Cir.2011). Ar-mijo-Mercado has filed a response.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">Included in Armijo-Mercado\u2019s response is a claim that counsel was ineffective for not arguing that Armijo-Mercado should receive a third point for acceptance of responsibility. We generally do not review claims of ineffective assistance of counsel on direct appeal. <em>United States v. Isgar, </em>739 F.3d 829, 841 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 123, 190 L.Ed.2d 94 (2014). However, this is one of those \u201crare cases in which the record\u201d permits us to \u201cfairly evaluate the merits of the claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citations omitted). The FPD requested a third point for acceptance of responsibility in his objections to the presentence report, and Armijo-Mercado received that point at sentencing. Accordingly, Armijo-Mercado has not shown counsel was ineffective with respect to the points assigned for acceptance of responsibility. <em>See Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). To the extent that Armijo-Mercado\u2019s response raises other claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, the record is not sufficiently developed to allow us to make a fair evaluation of those claims; we therefore decline to consider those claims without prejudice to collateral review. <em>See Is-gar, </em>739 F.3d at 841.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-13\">We have reviewed counsel\u2019s brief and the relevant portions of the record reflected therein, as well as Armijo-Merca-do\u2019s response. We concur with counsel\u2019s assessment that the appeal presents no nonfrivolous issue for appellate review. Accordingly, the motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th CiR. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b189-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
