He contends that his sentence is substantively unreasonable and greater than necessary to satisfy the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Specifically, Aviles argues that his sentence does not account for his personal circumstances, history, and characteristics, particularly his benign motives for illegally reentering the country and his intent to relocate to Nicaragua with his family. He challenges the illegal reentry guideline, arguing that it double counts a person\u2019s criminal history and lacks an empirical basis. He asserts that the advisory guidelines range overstated the seriousness of his offense and contends that his within-guidelines sentence should not be afforded a presumption of reasonableness.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-21\">We review the substantive reasonableness of a sentence for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The district court was \u201cin a superior position to find facts and judge their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>import under \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 339 (5th Cir.2008). The district court acknowledged Aviles\u2019s mitigating arguments but concluded that a 65-month sentence was appropriate. Aviles has failed to rebut the presumption of reasonableness that we apply to his within-guidelines sentence. <em>See United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009); <em>Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d at 338.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">Furthermore, we have rejected substantive reasonableness challenges based on the alleged lack of seriousness of an illegal reentry offense. <em>See United States v. Juarez-Duarte, </em>513 F.3d 204, 212 (5th Cir. 2008); <em>United States v. Aguirre-Villa, </em>460 F.3d 681, 683 (5th Cir.2006). We have also rejected the argument that U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2\u2019s double-counting of a prior conviction in the calculation of a defendant\u2019s offense level and criminal history score necessarily renders a sentence unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.2009). Finally, as Aviles concedes, his argument that the presumption of reasonableness should not be applied to his within-guidelines sentence is foreclosed. <em>See id. </em>at 530-31 (holding that <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), does not question the appellate presumption of reasonableness and does not require district or appellate courts to independently analyze the empirical grounding behind each individual guideline); <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 366-67 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">To the extent that Aviles argues that the district court erred in imposing a supervised release term, his claim is unavailing. The commentary to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Dl.l(c) states that courts should consider imposing a supervised release term if it is determined that such a term \u201cwould provide an added measure of deterrence and protection\u201d under the facts and circumstances. \u00a7 5D1.1, comment, (n.5); <em>see also United States v. Dominguez-Alvarado, </em>695 F.3d 324, 329 (5th Cir.2012). The district court expressly mentioned \u00a7 5Dl.l(c) and found that a supervised release term was required to provide an added measure of deterrence. Accordingly, imposition of the term did not constitute error, plain or otherwise. <em>See Dominguez-Alvarado, </em>695 F.3d at 329-30.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b203-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
