He contends that his sentence, which is within the applicable guidelines range of imprisonment, is substantively unreasonable. Jurado-Molina maintains that the district court placed undue weight on the need for the sentence imposed to protect the public from further crimes committed by him. We need not decide whether Ju-rado-Molina properly preserved an objection to the substantive reasonableness of his sentence because his argument fails even under an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>528 F.3d 519, 525 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">The record reflects that the district court\u2019s sentencing decision was based on an individualized assessment of the facts in light of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 49-51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The district court\u2019s determination of the proper sentence is entitled to deference, and w\u00e9 may not reweigh the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or reverse a sentence because we might reasonably conclude that a different sentence is appropriate. <em>Id. </em>at 51-52, 128 S.Ct. 586. Jurado-Molina\u2019s assertion that the district court should have given less weight to the need to protect the public from further crimes committed by him reflects his disagreement with the propriety of his sentence, which does not justify reversal. <em>See United States v. Ruiz, </em>621 F.3d 390, 398 (5th Cir.2010). He has set forth no other reason for us to disturb the presumption of reasonableness that applies to his sentence. <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-11\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b601-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
