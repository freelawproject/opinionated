Martinez-Lopez also appeals the district court\u2019s imposition of a ten-month sentence to be served consecutive to his seventy-two-month sentence for violating the conditions of his supervised release from a subsequent conviction. After careful review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we conclude that the sentence was procedurally and substantively reasonable. Accordingly, we affirm Martinez-Lopez\u2019s seventy-two-month sentence and his consecutive ten-month revocation sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-17\">Martinez-Lopez first came to the United States, entering through. California, when he was approximately twenty-four years of age. He eventually moved to Texas and was employed by Handyman Construction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>in Houston. In 2012, Martinez-Lopez was. arrested and pleaded guilty in the Northern District of Mississippi for the same criminal conduct that he currently pleads guilty to in this appeal \u2014 providing transportation to undocumented immigrants within the United States and for reentry of a removed undocumented immigrant. For these convictions, Martinez-Lopez was sentenced to thirteen months\u2019 imprisonment with an additional three-year term of supervised release. On January 8, 2018, Martinez-Lopez was released from custody, began serving his term of supervised release, and, on the same day, was also deported. Martinez-Lopez returned to Mexico to continue work in the construction industry.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-5\">Upon his return to the United States and until the time of his arrest in the instant case, Martinez-Lopez resumed work at Handyman Construction. In May 2013, local law enforcement officers stopped a sport utility vehicle (SUV) in which Martinez-Lopez was driving with twelve undocumented immigrants as passengers. When officers requested that Martinez-Lopez present his identification, he identified himself as Fredy Misanean-go-Cajoban, and stated that he and his passengers were traveling from Tennessee to North Carolina to seek employment. When officers attempted to place him under arrest, Martinez-Lopez fled into a nearby wooded area and was not apprehended until approximately five hours later.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-6\">While being questioned by agents from the Department of Homeland Security, Martinez-Lopez provided his real name. He admitted that he was a citizen of Mexico, that he had previously been removed from the United States, and that he had been living in Texas for the past three months. He also admitted to knowing that the passengers in his vehicle were likely undocumented immigrants. Martinez-Lopez claimed that he had not been paid for transporting the undocumented immigrants. However, two of the undocumented immigrants claimed that they paid $1,500.00 to be transported from Texas to New Jersey \u2014 neither indicated whether the money was paid to Martinez-Lopez directly. At least one other undocumented immigrant claimed he was traveling from Texas to New York, but he claimed that he did not know the cost of his transportation because, according to him, his father made the arrangements.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-8\">On appeal, Martinez-Lopez argues that his total sentence for the instant convictions was procedurally and substantively unreasonable for several reasons. First, Martinez-Lopez asserts that the district court erred in denying him a three-level reduction, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(l)(A), because the offense was committed for reasons other than for profit. Second, Martinez-Lopez contends that the district court erred in imposing a two-level enhancement, pursuant to \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(6), because his conduct did not create a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury. Third, Martinez-Lopez argues that his sentence is substantively unreasonable not only because of the arguments raised above in issues one and two, but also because the Guidelines for illegal reentry are unduly harsh and are not based on empirical evidence. Fourth, Martinez-Lopez asserts that the ten-month sentence to be served consecutively to his instant seventy-two-month sentence for violating the conditions of supervised release for a subsequent conviction was greater than necessary. Finally, Martinez-Lopez contends that the district court erred in imposing a fine because he lacks the present or future ability to pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-10\">We begin by addressing Martinez-Lopez\u2019s contentions that the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>erred when it denied him a three-level reduction pursuant to \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(l)(A), because the offense was committed for reasons other than for profit. We review a district court\u2019s interpretation of the Guidelines and application of the Guidelines to the facts de novo, and review its findings of fact for clear error. <em>United States v. Barrington, </em>648 F.3d 1178, 1194-95 (11th Cir.2011). A factual finding is clearly erroneous when, upon review of the evidence, we are \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1195 (internal quotation marks omitted). The defendant bears the burden of establishing the facts necessary to support a sentencing reduction by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>United States v. Perez-Oliveros, </em>479 F.3d 779, 783 (11th Cir.2007); <em>see also United States v. Zaldivar, </em>615 F.3d 1346, 1352 (11th Cir. 2010) (defendant bears the burden of proving that he committed the offense other than for profit). Under the preponderance of the evidence standard, the trier of fact must believe that the existence of a fact is more probable than not. <em>United States v. Almedina, </em>686 F.3d 1312, 1315 (11th Cir.), cert. denied, \u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 629, 184 L.Ed.2d 408 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b926-6\">Section 2L1.1(b)(1) provides for a three-level decrease in the defendant\u2019s base offense level if the offense was committed other than for profit or involved only the transportation of the defendant\u2019s spouse or child. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(l). An offense is committed other than for profit if there was neither a payment nor an expectation of payment for the transportation of any of the undocumented immigrants. <em>Id. </em>at cmt. n. 1. We have declined to reverse a district court\u2019s refusal to apply this three-level reduction where the defendant stated that he never received payment for his involvement in a smuggling operation, but some of the undocumented immigrants testified that they expected to pay for their transportation. <em>Zaldivar, </em>615 F.3d at 1352.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-8\">Martinez-Lopez did not put forward any affirmative evidence to suggest that he transported the undocumented immigrants for a reason other than profit. Even in the absence of evidence to suggest that Martinez-Lopez was paid directly, at least two of the undocumented immigrants admitted to having paid $1,500.00 for their transportation. <em>See id. </em>Pursuant to the Sentencing Guidelines, an \u201cexpectation of payment\u201d is enough to support a denial of the three-level reduction. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.1 cmt. n. 1. The record suggests that such an expectation existed since Martinez-Lopez was required to travel great distances to transport a number of undocumented immigrants, none of whom were members of his family or people that he knew, and all of whom were dangerously crammed into an SUV that lacked the capacity to accommodate each passenger safely. Under these circumstances, we are not left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made. <em>See Barrington, </em>648 F.3d at 1195. This is especially true since Martinez-Lopez has failed to put forth facts to support a conclusion that, more likely than not, the offense was committed other than for profit or involved only the transportation of his spouse or child. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(l); <em>see also Perez-Oliveros, </em>479 F.3d at 783. Therefore, the district court did not clearly err in denying Martinez-Lopez a three-level reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-10\">Next, we address Martinez-Lopez\u2019s contention that the district court\u2019s imposition of a two-level enhancement pursuant to \u00a7 2L1.1(b)(6) was procedurally unreasonable, because his conduct did not create a substantial risk of death or serious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>bodily injury. We review a district court\u2019s determination that the defendant\u2019s conduct created a risk of death or serious bodily injury for clear error. <em>United States v. Caraballo, </em>595 F.3d 1214, 1230 (11th Cir.2010). The government bears the burden of establishing the facts necessary to support a sentencing enhancement by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Perez-Oliveros, </em>479 F.3d at 783. Section 2L1.1(b)(6) provides for a two-level increase in a defendant\u2019s base offense level if the offense involved intentionally or recklessly creating a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to another person. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(6). The commentary to \u00a7 2L1.1 states that the enhancement applies to a wide variety of conduct, including \u201ccarrying substantially more passengers than the rated capacity of a motor vehicle [or] harboring persons in a crowded, dangerous, or inhumane condition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2L1.1 cmt. n. 5. We have upheld the application of the \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(6) enhancement where the defendant transported eleven undocumented immigrants in cramped conditions on a small vessel without enough life jackets. <em>See Caraballo, </em>595 F.3d at 1230-31; <em>see also United States v. Rodriguez-Lopez, </em>363 F.3d 1134, 1138 (11th Cir.2004) (affirming application of the enhancement for the hazardous transportation of undocumented immigrants by boat; explaining that there is \u201cno material distinction\u201d between smugglers who transport undocumented immigrants on land without seat-belts and those who transport them on water without life jackets); <em>see also United States v. Ortiz, </em>242 F.3d 1078, 1079 (8th Cir.2001) (per curiam) (affirming application of the enhancement when twenty-three undocumented immigrants were transported in a van equipped with only fourteen seatbelts)</p>\n<p id=\"b927-5\">Here, the record clearly demonstrates that Martinez-Lopez was carrying significantly more passengers (twelve to be exact) than the rated capacity of his vehicle. At most, Martinez-Lopez\u2019s vehicle had seating for a total of eight people with the third row of seats installed. Therefore, even with all of the seats installed, Martinez-Lopez was carrying at least four extra passengers \u2014 sixty-six percent more passengers than the rated capacity of the vehicle. What is worse, the evidence showed that the third row of seats was not even installed at the time of Martinez-Lopez\u2019s arrest. This means that there were in fact seven passengers that were tightly packed into the cargo area of the vehicle without seats or seatbelts. Consequently, these undocumented immigrants were subjected to crowded and inhumane conditions and an increased risk of death or serious injury in the event of an accident \u2014 especially a rear-end collision. <em>See Caraballo, </em>595 F.3d at 1230-31; <em>Rodriguez-Lopez, </em>363 F.3d at 1138. Accordingly, the district did not commit clear error when it applied the \u00a7 2L1.1(b)(6) enhancement because Martinez-Lopez\u2019s conduct created a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-7\">Next, we confront Martinez-Lopez\u2019s arguments that the Guidelines for illegal reentry lack grounding in empirical data, are unduly harsh, and, as a result, are substantively unreasonable. Martinez-Lopez also argues that his sentence essentially reflects improper double-counting of his criminal history.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-8\">For ease of reference, we address the issues in this subsection in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-9\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-10\">We address first Martinez-Lopez\u2019s claim that the Guidelines for illegal reentry lack <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>grounding in empirical data, are unduly harsh, and, as a result, are substantively unreasonable. Since we concluded above that Martinez-Lopez\u2019s sentence is free of procedural errors, we then determine whether the sentence imposed was substantively reasonable taking into account the totality of the circumstances. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). \u201cThe party challenging the sentence bears the burden to show it is unreasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Tome, </em>611 F.3d 1371,1378 (11th Cir.2010). The district court must impose a sentence that is \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary\u201d to comply with the purposes of sentencing set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2), including the need to promote respect for the law, provide just punishment for the offense, deter criminal conduct, and protect the public from further crimes of the defendant. <em>See 18 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). Additionally, in imposing a particular sentence the court must consider the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, the kinds of sentences available, the applicable guideline range, any relevant policy statements of the Sentencing Commission, the need to avoid unwarranted disparities in sentencing, and the need to provide restitution to victims. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(1), (3)-(7). The weight given to any particular factor is committed to the sound discretion of the district court. <em>United States v. Clay, </em>483 F.3d 739, 743 (11th Cir.2007). However, we will remand if \u201cwe are left with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1190 (11th Cir.2010) (en banc) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b928-4\">The fact that a particular Guideline is not based on empirical evidence is not an independent ground for invalidating that Guideline. <em>United States v. Snipes, </em>611 F.3d 855, 870 (11th Cir.2010). A district court may, however, consider the lack of empirical evidence as a relevant factor in exercising its right to depart from the Guidelines. <em>Id. </em>Although we do not presume that a sentence falling within the guideline range is reasonable, we ordinarily expect such a sentence to be reasonable. <em>United States v. Hunt, </em>526 F.3d 739, 746 (11th Cir.2008). Likewise, a sentence imposed well below the statutory maximum penalty also indicates that the sentence is reasonable. <em>See United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b928-6\">Martinez-Lopez\u2019s argument that his sentence is substantively unreasonable because the Guidelines for illegal reentry are not based on empirical evidence lacks merit. The lack of empirical evidence alone does not require a district court to accord no deference to the guideline range. <em>Snipes, </em>611 F.3d at 870. Rather, it is simply one factor that the district court may consider alongside the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in fashioning a sentence that is appropriate but not greater than necessary. <em>See id. </em>Furthermore, the district court found that a within-guideline sentence was warranted given Martinez-Lopez\u2019s absolute disregard for the laws of the United States, as evidenced by his consistent pattern of reentering the United States after being deported. As such, a harsher sentence was necessary to deter Martinez-Lopez from continuing that pattern in the future, as well as to promote respect for the law, deter other undocumented immigrant smugglers and protect the public. <em>See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 </em>3553(a)(2). <em>Moreover, </em>Martinez-Lopez\u2019s sentence was within the guideline range and substantially below the statutory maximum of twenty years\u2019 imprisonment for Count 1. This Court can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>ordinarily expect such a sentence to be reason\u00e1ble. <em>See Hunt, </em>526 F.3d at 746; <em>Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d at 1324. Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in imposing a total seventy-two-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-6\">To the extent that Martinez-Lopez also argues that his sentence reflected improper double-counting of his criminal history, this argument lacks merit too. The consideration of a defendant\u2019s criminal history in imposing a particular sentence does not result in an additional punishment for the prior offense, but rather a stiffened penalty for the current offense. <em>Witte v. United States, </em>515 U.S. 389, 400, 115 S.Ct. 2199, 2206, 132 L.Ed.2d 351 (1995). Additionally, the enhancements provided under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 do not constitute improper double counting of an undocumented immigrant defendant\u2019s criminal history because they are designed to serve a different purpose than the criminal history category. <em>See United States v. Adeleke, </em>968 F.2d 1159, 1161 (11th Cir.1992). The criminal history category is meant to punish recidivists more severely, whereas the enhancements under \u00a7 2L1.2 are intended to deter reentry by undocumented immigrants who have been convicted of felony offenses. <em>See id. </em>Furthermore, we have held that consideration of a defendant\u2019s prior offenses under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1) is appropriate even though those offenses are also considered in calculating the defendant\u2019s guideline range. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>526 F.3d 1312, 1324 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b929-7\">This Court has held that enhancements under \u00a7 2L1.2 serve a different purpose than the criminal history category, and consideration of the same prior crime for both purposes therefore does not constitute double counting. <em>See Adeleke, </em>968 F.2d at 1161. As such, Martinez-Lopez\u2019s guideline range accurately reflected the various aims of the Sentencing Commission and did not constitute duplicative counting of his criminal history. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b929-9\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-10\">Martinez-Lopez also challenges the district court\u2019s imposition of a ten-month sentence for violating the terms of his supervised release. He claims that the sentence is unnecessary, and, therefore, substantively unreasonable. In addition, he contends that this sentence failed to consider the fact that he was sentenced near the top end of the advisory guidelines range for the instant conviction, upon which the revocation was based. Finally, he asserts that the district court\u2019s justification for the imposition of the ten-month revocation sentence \u2014 to make up for its imposition of a lower sentence on the instant conviction \u2014 failed because a six-month consecutive sentence would have satisfied that goal.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-11\">We review a district court\u2019s revocation of supervised release for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Velasquez Velasquez, </em>524 F.3d 1248, 1252 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam). Upon finding that the defendant has violated a condition of his supervised release, a district court may revoke the supervised release and impose a term of imprisonment. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3). In determining whether to revoke supervised release, the district court must consider certain of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Id. </em>The sentence imposed on the revocation is reviewed for reasonableness. <em>Velasquez Velasquez, </em>524 F.3d at 1252. \u201cThe party challenging the sentence bears the burden to show it is unreasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>Tome, </em>611 F.3d at 1378. District courts have discretion in determining whether to impose sentences <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>consecutively or concurrently. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584(a). The Guidelines\u2019 policy statement regarding revocation of supervised release advises that any term of imprisonment imposed upon revocation of supervised release be served consecutively to any other term of imprisonment the defendant is serving, regardless of whether the sentence being served resulted from the conduct that was the basis for the revocation. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.3(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b930-4\">Here, Martinez-Lopez failed to show that his revocation sentence was unreasonable in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The district court considered the facts and sentence for the new conviction, in addition to the facts of the underlying conviction when it fashioned the revocation sentence. Furthermore, the district court deliberately elected not to give a top of the guideline sentence on the new conviction because it intended to impose a consecutive top of the guideline sentence for violating the conditions of his supervised release. The district court explained that the total eighty-two-month sentence in essence reflected the top of the guideline range for the new conviction, plus an additional four months to reflect the supervised release violation. The district court deemed such a sentence appropriate to reflect Martinez-Lopez\u2019s flagrant refusal to obey the laws of the United States and demonstrated the district court\u2019s adequate consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in fashioning both a total sentence and the revocation sentence. The revocation sentence reflected the nature and circumstances of the offense and Martinez-Lopez\u2019s criminal history and characteristics, and it served to promote respect for the law, provide just punishment for Martinez-Lopez\u2019s supervised release violation, and deter Martinez-Lopez from future criminal conduct. Furthermore, Martinez-Lopez\u2019s ten-month revocation sentence was within the guideline range, which we ordinarily expect to be reasonable. Therefore, the district court did not abuse its discretion when it imposed a consecutive ten-month sentence for Martinez-Lopez\u2019s violation of supervised release. .</p>\n<p id=\"b930-6\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-7\">Finally, Martinez-Lopez argues that the district court erred in imposing a fine because the evidence showed that he had no income at the time of his arrest, has no assets currently, and has low future earning potential due to his limited education, and, therefore, he did not have the ability to pay. Martinez-Lopez further contends that both the probation officer and the district court erred when concluding that he would be able to earn money during his term of incarceration because deportable undocumented immigrants are not eligible to participate in Bureau of Prisons (BOP) work programs.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-8\">We review a district court\u2019s determination that the defendant is able to pay a fine for clear error. <em>United, States v. Gonzalez, </em>541 F.3d 1250, 1255 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam). It is the defendant\u2019s burden to prove that he is unable to pay a f\u00edne. <em>Id. </em>The Guidelines require the district court to impose a f\u00edne in all cases, unless the defendant establishes that he is presently unable to pay and is unlikely to become able to pay a fine in future. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5E1.2(a). If the defendant establishes that he is unable to pay a fine within the guideline range or if the imposition of a fine is found to have an undue burden on the defendant\u2019s dependents, then the court may impose a lesser fine. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 5E 1.2(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b930-9\">If the district court determines that a fine is appropriate, the court should consider several factors in determining the amount of the fine. <em>Gonzalez, </em>541 F.3d at 1255. These factors are: (1) the need for the sentence to reflect the seriousness of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>the offense, promote respect for the law, provide just punishment, and afford adequate deterrence; (2) evidence as to the defendant\u2019s ability to pay in light of his earning capacity and financial resources; (3) the burden on the defendant and his dependents; (4) any restitution the defendant has made or is obligated to make; (5) collateral consequences of conviction; (6) whether the defendant previously has been fined for a similar offense; (7) the expected costs to the government of imprisonment, probation, or supervised release; and (8) any other pertinent equitable considerations. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5E1.2(d)(l)-(8).</p>\n<p id=\"b931-5\">We do not require the district court to make specific findings with respect to the guidelines factors. <em>Gonzalez, </em>541 F.3d at 1256. Rather, the record must reflect only that the district court considered the factors before imposing the fine. <em>Id. </em>Where the PSI contains information with respect to the \u00a7 5E 1.2(d) factors and the district court reviewed the PSI before imposing the fine, we infer that the district court considered those factors before imposing the fine. <em>See United States v. McNair, </em>605 F.3d 1152, 1234 (11th Cir.2010). However, if the record does not reflect a reasoned basis for imposing a fine, we will remand the case so that the district court may make the necessary factual findings. <em>Gonzalez, </em>541 F.3d at 1256.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-6\">Here, the information in the PSI discussed Martinez-Lopez\u2019s prior convictions, deportations, and illegal reentries into the United States, all of which weigh in favor of the need to promote respect for the law, provide just punishment, and afford adequate deterrence. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5E1.2(d)(1). The PSI also included information regarding Martinez-Lopez\u2019s educational background and employment history, which is relevant to Martinez-Lopez\u2019s ability to pay a fine. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 5E1.2(d)(2). Moreover, the PSI described Martinez-Lopez\u2019s family situation, stated that he would not have to pay restitution, noted his immigration status, and identified the cost of his incarceration, all of which are relevant facts for the consideration of the remaining \u00a7 5E1.2(d) factors. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 5E1.2(d)(3)-(7). In addition, the facts in the PSI indicate that Martinez-Lopez has prior work experience in the construction industry (both in the United States and in Mexico) and that he was employed at the time of his arrest. Martinez-Lopez has failed to show he will be unable to obtain employment after his release or that the fine imposed by the district court will create an undue burden on his family. While we recognize that the district court did not explicitly make findings with respect to the \u00a7 5E1.2(d) factors at sentencing, the district court reviewed the PSI<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that contained information regarding those factors before imposing the sentence, and, therefore, we infer that the district court considered the \u00a7 5E 1.2(d) factors. <em>McNair, </em>605 F.3d at 1234.
