The district court sentenced him to 51 months in prison, which was at the top of his advisory guidelines range. He now appeals his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-20\">We review for plain error Martinez\u2019s claim that the Government breached the plea agreement by violating its promise not to oppose his request to be held accountable for not more than 24 aliens. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). To show plain error, Martinez must show a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and that affects his substantial rights. <em>See id. </em>If he makes such a showing, we have the discretion to correct the error but only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b198-21\">Although the plea agreement included a waiver of Martinez\u2019s right to appeal his sentence, an appeal waiver is unenforceable if the Government breaches a plea agreement. <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>309 F.3d 882, 886 (5th Cir.2002). The Government did not breach the plea agreement in this case. In fact, the Government specifically stated that it was honoring the agreement by advocating for the 24-alien count. Furthermore, the Government\u2019s statement that the district court was not bound by the promise in the plea agreement did not constitute a breach of the agreement. <em>See United States v. Ben-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number><em>chimol, </em>471 U.S. 453, 455-56, 105 S.Ct. 2103, 85 L.Ed.2d 462 (1985); Fed. R.CRIM.P. ll(b)(l)(M). Because the Government did not breach the plea agreement, the valid appeal waiver bars this appeal. <em>See United States v. Purser, </em>747 F.3d 284, 294-95 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 403, 190 L.Ed.2d 293 (2014). Accordingly, the appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b198-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
