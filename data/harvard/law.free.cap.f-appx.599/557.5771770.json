The district court denied his petition on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-22\">Green was released from prison while the instant appeal was pending. An appeal is not moot simply because a \u00a7 2241 petitioner is no longer in custody. <em>Brown v. Resor, </em>407 F.2d 281, 283 (5th Cir.1969). However, an action is moot when the court cannot grant the relief requested by the moving party. <em>See Bailey v. Southerland, </em>821 F.2d 277, 278 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>Green\u2019s petition does not challenge his conviction which carries collateral consequences even after release. <em>See Spencer v. Kemna, </em>523 U.S. 1, 7, 118 S.Ct. 978, 140 L.Ed.2d 43 (1998). Instead, Green\u2019s petition alleges purported errors that occurred after he was sentenced, for which he seeks the restoration of lost good time credit and restoration of his classification level. Because Green was released in January 2015, this court can no longer provide him with that relief. <em>See Bailey, </em>821 F.2d at 278. Insofar as Green\u2019s claim includes a request for expungement of the disciplinary charge from his record, this issue is similarly moot as he has not alleged any adverse consequences that will continue to flow from that violation. <em>See id. </em>at 279. Accordingly, Green\u2019s appeal is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b595-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
