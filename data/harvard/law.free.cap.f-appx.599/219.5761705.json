The district court granted the government\u2019s motion to dismiss for want of jurisdiction under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) \u201cbecause the plaintiffs failed to present their administrative claims within two years of accrual as required by the FTCA.\u201d The district court explained its ruling in a brief but sufficiently thorough and convincing Memorandum Opinion filed September 23, 2014. The court correctly reasoned, based on undisputed facts, that Mr. Bath knew of the injury well before filing his administrative claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-22\">The judgment of dismissal is AFFIRMED, essentially for the reasons advanced by the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b257-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
