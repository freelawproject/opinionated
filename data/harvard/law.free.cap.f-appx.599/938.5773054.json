Defendant Gregory Lose, a police officer monitoring the handicapped parking spaces \u2014 because, according to the bank, they were being used unlawfully \u2014 approached Jones and asked to see her driver\u2019s license. Jones refused Officer Lose\u2019s request, stating: \u201cYou have no right to see that.\u201d Officer Lose therefore arrested her.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-22\">In Count I of Jones\u2019s amended complaint, she alleged that this encounter constituted a \u201cstop and seizure\u201d in violation of the Fourth Amendment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Officer Lose pled the defense of qualified immunity and moved for summary judgment. The District Court granted Officer Lose\u2019s motion for summary judgment on Count I. Jones appeals. We affirm. First, Officer Lose had arguable reasonable suspicion to conduct an investigatory stop. And when Jones refused to show him her driver\u2019s license, Officer Lose had arguable probable cause to arrest her for driving without a current driver\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-23\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b976-25\">. We assume that Count I was brought under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, which incorporates the Fourth Amendment right against unreasonable searches and seizures. <em>See Mapp v. Ohio, </em>367 U.S. 643, 655-56, 81 S.Ct. 1684, 1691-92, 6 L.Ed.2d 1081 (1961).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
