Payton subsequently entered an <em>Alford </em>plea in connection with her arrest. Consequently, Payton\u2019s claims are barred by <em>Heck v. Humphrey </em>unless the \u201cfactual basis for the <em>[Alford </em>plea] is temporally and conceptually distinct from the excessive force claim.\u201d <em>Bush v. Strain, </em>513 F.3d 492, 498 (5th Cir.2008). Because Payton has not articulated facts that could support her excessive force claims without running afoul of <em>Heck, </em>summary judgment for the defendants was proper. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-10\">We review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. Dillon v. Rogers, </em>596 F.3d 260, 266 (5th Cir.2010). Summary judgment is appropriate if \u201cthe movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a). All facts and inferences are construed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. <em>Dillon, </em>596 F.3d at 266.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-15\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-16\">Payton filed a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action against Jefferson Parish Sheriff Newell Normand and Jefferson Parish Sheriffs Deputies Danny Julian and Mark Iannazzo alleging that she was injured by their use of excessive force during an incident outside her daughter\u2019s house. In February 2012, there was an altercation between Payton\u2019s daughter and Payton\u2019s daughter\u2019s boyfriend in which both Payton and the defendant officers became involved. Stemming from this incident, Payton was arrested and charged with resisting a police officer and interfering with the police. She entered an <em>Alford </em>plea to the misdemeanor of interfering with law enforcement officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-17\">Payton then brought this lawsuit alleging that she sustained injuries to her face, knee, neck, and wrists due to the defendants\u2019 excessive force during the arrest. According to Payton, she was injured when officer Iannazzo grabbed her from behind and threw her to the ground while she was standing, uninvolved in the altercation. According to the defendants, Pay-ton refused orders to remove herself from the incident and was physically interfering when she was injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-18\"><em>Heck v. Humphrey </em>bars a claim for \u201callegedly unconstitutional conviction or imprisonment, or for other harm caused by actions whose unlawfulness would render a conviction or sentence invalid\u201d unless \u201cthat ... conviction or sentence has been reversed on direct appeal, expunged by executive order, declared invalid by a state tribunal authorized to make such determi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>nation, or called into question by a federal court\u2019s issuance of a writ of habeas corpus.\u201d 512 U.S. at 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364. This rule applies equally to <em>Alford </em>pleas. <em>Ballard v. Burton, </em>444 F.3d 391, 396-97 (5th Cir.2006). However, \u201ca claim that excessive force occurred after the arrestee has ceased his or her [interference] would not necessarily imply the invalidity of a conviction for the earlier [interference].\u201d <em>Bush, </em>513 F.3d at 498. The inquiry as to whether an excessive force claim is barred under <em>Heck </em>is \u201canalytical and fact-intensive\u201d and depends upon whether \u201cthe factual basis for the conviction is temporally and conceptually distinct from the excessive force claim.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">Appellant, in both her Complaint and her brief on appeal, relies on a version of the facts that is inconsistent with her arrest and <em>Alford </em>plea for interfering with the officers. For the reasons explained by the district court, we hold that her \u00a7 1983 claim is barred by <em>Heck. </em>Because her underlying claim against Iannazzo and Julian is barred, her claims against Sheriff Normand are likewise barred. <em>See Rios v. City of Del Rio, Tex., </em>444 F.3d 417, 425 (5th Cir.2006) (holding that there can be no supervisory liability where there is no underlying constitutional violation). The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b229-11\"> Pursuant to Fifth Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in Fifth Cir.
