' Mr. Belue also claimed that his trial counsel and a court reporter conspired to change one of the juror\u2019s answers to a <em>voir dire </em>question to conceal the juror\u2019s bias. The district court, acting <em>sua sponte, </em>dismissed Mr. Belue\u2019s complaint under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(A)(b)(l) on the grounds that his claims were frivolous, time-barred, and barred by <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). Mr. Belue timely appealed. Because we agree with the district court that Mr. Belue\u2019s claims are time-barred, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-19\">\u201cWe review a district court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal of a suit for failure to state a claim for relief under \u00a7 1915A(b)(l) <em>de novo.\u201d Harden v. Pataki </em>320 F.3d 1289, 1292 (11th Cir.2003). Federal courts must apply a \u201cforum state\u2019s statute of limitations for personal injury actions to actions brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.\u201d <em>Lovett v. Ray, </em>327 F.3d 1181, 1182 (11th Cir.2003). \u201cThe two-year limitations period of Ala.Code \u00a7 6 \u2014 2\u201438(\u00ed) applies to section 1983 actions in Alabama.\u201d <em>Jones v. Preuit &amp; Mauldin, </em>876 F.2d 1480, 1483 (11th Cir.1989). We may affirm a district court\u2019s dismissal of a complaint as time-barred where a prisoner fails to identify why the statute of limitations might be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>tolled in his case. <em>See Hughes v. Lott, </em>350 F.3d 1157, 1163 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">Mr. Belue contends that the events giving rise to his \u00a7 1983 claim occurred in August of 1995. He filed his lawsuit in August of 2013, approximately 18 years later, which is well beyond the two-year statute of limitations, and has failed to assert any reasons why the statute of limitations period should be tolled. Accordingly, his claims are time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
