On appeal, Mr. Smith contends that the district court judge (1) should have disqualified himself from deciding the motion due to personal bias and (2) engaged in a fraud upon the court when he dismissed Mr. Smith\u2019s underlying claim as time barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">Mr. Smith\u2019s first argument on appeal is that'the district court judge should have disqualified himself due to personal bias.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We review a district court judge\u2019s denial of a motion to recuse for an abuse of discretion. <em>Gwynn v. Walker (In re Walker), </em>532 F.3d 1304, 1308 (11th Cir.2008). A judge is to recuse \u201chimself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455(a). The standard for recusal under \u00a7 455(a) is \u201cwhether an objective, disinterested, lay observer fully informed of the facts underlying the grounds on which recusal was sought would entertain a significant doubt about the judge\u2019s impartiality.\u201d <em>United States v. Patti, </em>337 F.3d 1317, 1321 (11th Cir.2003) (internal quotation marks omitted). The general rule is that \u201cbias sufficient to disqualify a judge must stem from extrajudicial sources.\u201d <em>Gwynn, </em>532 F.3d at 1310 (internal citation marks omitted). A judge\u2019s rulings in a case are a basis for recusal only when they \u201cshow such pervasive bias and prejudice that it constitutes bias against a party.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1311.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">There is no evidence of extrajudicial bias in this case. Instead, the only acts that Mr. Smith argues warrant recusal are rulings by the district court judge with which Mr. Smith disagrees. Because a fully informed and objective observer would not entertain a significant doubt about the district court judge\u2019s impartiality, Mr. Smith has not shown that the district court abused its discretion when it refused to recuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-10\">Mr. Smith further argues that the district court erred in denying his Rule 60(d)(3) motion. He argues that the magistrate judge and the district court judge committed fraud by dismissing his underlying claims as time barred because they failed to discuss complaints he filed with the Department of Housing and Urban Development (\u201cHUD\u201d), which, he asserts, tolled the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-11\">Under Rule 60(d)(3), a district court can \u201cset aside a judgment for fraud on the court.\u201d <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(d)(3). The party seeking relief under Rule 60(d)(3) must establish fraud \u201cby clear and convincing evidence.\u201d <em>Booker v. Dugger, </em>825 F.2d 281, 283 (11th Cir.1987). \u201cGenerally speaking, only the most egregious misconduct, such as bribery of a judge or members of a jury or the fabrication of evidence by a party in which the attorney is implicated, will constitute a fraud on the court.\u201d <em>Rozier v. Ford Motor Co., </em>573 F.2d 1332, 1338 (5th Cir.1978) (internal quotation marks omitted).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We review the denial of a Rule 60(d)(3) motion for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Booker, </em>825 F.2d at 285.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-12\">Because there is no evidence of fraud in this case, the district court did not abuse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>its discretion in denying Mr. Smith\u2019s motion. Mr. Smith argues that the district and magistrate judges committed fraud by failing to consider his argument that the statute of limitations was tolled while HUD investigated his claims. However, the record shows that the court considered and rejected the tolling argument when it held that, \u201cregardless of any excludable time,\u201d the statute of limitations had run. <em>See </em>May 23, 2012 Order at 2 (DE 22). Mr. Smith has not presented any clear and convincing evidence of fraud in this case. Instead, he improperly seeks to relitigate the merits of his equitable tolling argument through a Rule 60(d)(3) motion. Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Mr. Smith\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b404-7\">. Mr. Smith also argues that the district court judge refused to consider his original motion for relief and the first amendment to the motion. The record shows, however, that the district court ruled on Mr. Smith's original motion and his subsequent amendments to the motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b404-13\">. In <em>Bonner v. City of Prichard, </em>661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir.1981), this Court adopted as binding precedent all decisions of the former Fifth Circuit handed down prior to the close of business on September 30, 1981.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
