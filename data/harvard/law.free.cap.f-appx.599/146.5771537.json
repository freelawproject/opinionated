California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), <em>United States v. Flores, </em>632 F.3d 229 (5th Cir.2011), and <em>United States v. Moreno-Torres, </em>768 F.3d 439, 441 n. 2 (5th Cir.2014). Barajas has filed two responses. The record is not sufficiently developed to allow us to mak\u00e9 a fair evaluation of Barajas\u2019s claims of ineffective assistance of counsel; we therefore deny those claims without prejudice to collateral review. <em>See United States v. Isgar, </em>739 F.3d 829, 841 (5th Cir.2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">We have reviewed counsel\u2019s brief and the relevant portions of the record, as well as Barajas\u2019s responses. We concur with counsel\u2019s assessment that the appeal presents no nonfrivolous issue for appellate review. \u25a0 The motion for leave to withdraw is therefore GRANTED, and counsel is excused from further responsibilities. Ba-rajas\u2019s motions to vacate the judgment of the district court and remand for resen-tencing are DENIED, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b185-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
