He claims the district court committed procedural error by applying sentencing enhancements for: using a computer, pursuant to Guideline \u00a7 2G2.1(b)(6); distributing pornographic images, pursuant to \u00a7 2G2.1(b)(3); and having custody, care, or control over the minor victim, pursuant to \u00a7 2G2.1(b)(5). He also claims procedural error by asserting the application of enhancements based on the age of the victim, the offense involving sexual contact, and the offense involving sadistic conduct resulted in impermissible double-counting. He further asserts his sentence is substantively unreasonable because the court failed: to adequately consider whether a sentencing disparity would result, given his codefendant received a 278-month sentence; and to address whether it considered his being sexually molested as a child.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">Although <em>post-Booker, </em>the Guidelines are advisory only, and a properly preserved objection to an ultimate sentence is reviewed for reasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard, the district court must still properly calculate the advisory Guidelines-sentencing range for use in deciding on the sentence to impose. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). In that respect, for issues preserved in district court, its application of the Guidelines is reviewed <em>de novo; </em>its factual findings, only for clear error. <em>E.g.; United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">But, because Rogers did not raise his objections to the application of the enhancements at issue in district coui\u2019t, review is only for plain error. <em>E.g., United States v. Broussard, </em>669 F.3d 537, 546 (5th Cir.2012). Under that standard, Rogers must show a forfeited plain (clear or obvious) error that affected his substantial rights. <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If he does so, we have the discretion to correct the error, but should do so only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the proceedings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">Rogers claims the court erred in applying a computer-use enhancement. He contends: a cell phone is not a \u201ccomputer\u201d for purposes of the enhancement; and, because the evidence showed he used only a cell phone, the enhancement is inapplicable. Although our court has not addressed whether a cell phone falls within the definition of \u201ccomputer\u201d for purposes of Guideline \u00a7 2G2.1 (b)(6), at least two other circuits have concluded the use of a cell phone to make calls and send text messages constitutes the use of a computer for purposes of the enhancement. <em>United States v. Mathis, </em>767 F.3d 1264, 1282 (11th Cir.2014); <em>United States v. Kramer, </em>631 F.3d 900, 902-04 (8th Cir.2011). Accordingly, even assuming the court erred in applying the enhancement based on Rogers\u2019 cell-phone use, any error was neither clear nor obvious. <em>E.g., United States v. Salinas, </em>480 F.3d 750, 759 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-9\">Further, Rogers challenges the sufficiency of the evidence supporting this computer-use enhancement. Although Rogers claims no direct evidence shows his communications were made to facilitate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>travel of the child, a reasonable inference can be drawn that Rogers communicated with the child\u2019s uncle either by phone or text in an effort to facilitate taking the minor. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Wilcox, </em>631 F.3d 740, 755 (5th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">Additionally, Rogers has failed to show that the court committed plain (clear or obvious) error in applying enhancements based on distribution of a sexually-explicit video, under Guideline \u00a7 2G2.1 (b)(3), and, his custody or control of the child, under Guideline \u00a7 2G2.1(b)(5). Distribution of sexually explicit images by a codefendant can be used against the defendant as \u201crelevant conduct\u201d where, as in this instance, the defendant participates in the production of the material. <em>See United States v. Odom, </em>694 F.3d 544, 547-48 (5th Cir.2012). \u201cA determination of relevant conduct is a finding of fact,\u201d <em>United States v. Ekanem, </em>555 F.3d 172, 175 (5th Cir.2009), which can never constitute plain error, <em>e.g., United States v. Lopez, </em>923 F.2d 47, 50 (5th Cir. 1991). Similarly, whether a victim was in the \u201ccustody, care, or supervisory control\u201d of the defendant is a factual determination. <em>E.g., United States v. Alfaro, </em>555 F.3d 496, 498-99 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">As for his double-counting contention, Rogers acknowledges the Guidelines at issue do not forbid the imposition of the challenged enhancements, and he concedes his argument is foreclosed. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Garcia-Gonzalez, </em>714 F.3d 306, 315-16 (5th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-9\">Finally, Rogers claims his sentence is substantively unreasonable because the court failed to account for the possible sentencing disparity between his and his codefendant\u2019s sentence and his childhood sexual abuse. Although Rogers failed to properly object to these bases, review is arguably for abuse of discretion because he asserted them at sentencing. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Rodriguez, </em>523 F.3d 519, 526 &amp; n. 1 (5th Cir.2008). In addressing the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors, the court specifically addressed the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities, but noted the varying conduct between Rogers and his codefendant, and stated it considered Rogers\u2019 personal history and circumstances, including the testimony of witnesses presented in mitigation of sentence. Under the circumstances, Rogers fails to demonstrate an abuse of discretion. <em>See, e.g., Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51-52, 128 S.Ct. 586.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b261-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
