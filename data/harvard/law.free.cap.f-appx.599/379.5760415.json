The amended complaint contains three claims against Green Point. Two are relevant here as claims under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (\u201cRICO\u201d). More specifically, Counts II and III allege that Green Point is liable for the inflated property appraisal under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962(c)-(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">Green Point moved the District Court to dismiss White\u2019s amended complaint on the ground that the RICO claims were barred by the four-year statute of limitations. <em>Agency Holding Corp. v. Malley-Duff &amp; Assocs., Inc., </em>483 U.S. 143, 156, 107 S.Ct. 2759, 2767, 97 L.Ed.2d 121 (1987) (\u201c[W]e conclude that ... the federal policies that lie behind RICO and the practicalities of RICO litigation make the selection of the 4-year statute of limitations for Clayton Act actions, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 15b, the most appropriate limitations period for RICO actions.\u201d). The District Court, in an order entered on June 26, 2014, agreed that the claims were time-barred and dismissed White\u2019s claims with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">White appeals. We affirm. We note that White did not oppose Green Point\u2019s motion to dismiss. As a general rule, a party presented with a motion to dismiss \u201cmust proffer some legal basis to support his cause of action.\u201d <em>Cnty. of McHenry v. Ins. Co. of the West, </em>438 F.3d 813, 818 (7th Cir.2006). And \u201c[arguments raised for the first time on appeal are not properly before this Court.\u201d <em>Hurley v. Moore, </em>233 F.3d 1295, 1297 (11th Cir.2000). The arguments White presents in support of the timeliness of his claims were not presented to the District Court. We therefore do not consider them.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
