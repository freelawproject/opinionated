The district court ruled that Green failed to establish that Collins\u2019s conduct was motivated by race or sufficiently severe to alter Green\u2019s work environment and that Green failed to establish that the legitimate reasons proffered for his five-day suspension were pretexts for discrimination and retaliation. Green argues that the district court erred by considering more than his undisputed statement of the facts on summary judgment and that he produced \u201coverwhelming circumstantial evidence\u201d of discrimination and retaliation. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-8\">The district court could consider the record as a whole to determine the undisputed facts on summary judgment. Rule 56 provides that parties should cite particular parts of the record to support their respective arguments that a fact cannot or can be genuinely disputed, Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(c)(1), but the rule also recognizes that parties need not always refer to specific record materials, <em>id. </em>56(c)(1)(B) <em>&amp; </em>advisory committee\u2019s note to 2010 amendment. And the district court is not strictly .bound by the cited materials; the district court \u201cneed consider only the cited materials, but it may consider other materials in the record.\u201d <em>Id. </em>56(c)(3). Green argues that the City and Collins failed to cite portions of the record that supported their version of events, but \u201c[i]f a party fails to properly support an assertion of fact or fails to properly address another party\u2019s assertion of fact as required by Rule 56(c),\u201d the district court can \u201cgrant summary judgment if the motion and supporting materials \u2014 including the facts considered undisputed \u2014 show that the movant is entitled to it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>56(e)(3). As explained by the district court in its written order, it considered \u201cthe record[ and] the submissions of the parties\u201d in deciding whether to grant the motion of the City and Collins for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-10\">The district court did not err by entering summary judgment against Green\u2019s complaint about a hostile work environment. To survive summary judgment, Green had to establish that he was harassed because of his race and that the \u201charassment was sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the terms and conditions of employment and create a discriminatorily abusive working environment.\u201d <em>Miller v. Kenworth of Dothan, Inc., </em>277 F.3d 1269, 1275 (11th Cir.2002). Green testified that Collins, in an effort to oust Green from office in 2009, harassed him for cursing publicly and for commuting in a BMW vehicle seized by the narcotics division instead of the Crown Victoria vehicle he had been assigned. Green also testified that Collins interfered with Green\u2019s authority by changing the striping on patrol cars; retaining purchase orders; sending Green the final opinion in employee psychological reports instead of the complete reports; interviewing an applicant for a bailiff position; and deferring Green\u2019s recommended promotions. No reasonable person would have found that Collins\u2019s conduct created a work environment so hostile or abusive that it altered the terms and conditions of Green\u2019s employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number>Green contended that Collins harbored racial animus as evidenced by a remark he supposedly made to his father-in-law that he was going to \u201cget rid of the black son-of-a-bitch who drives the BMW,\u201d but that \u201cinadmissible hearsay [could not] be considered on a motion for summary judgment,\u201d <em>Macuba v. Deboer, </em>193 F.3d 1316, 1322 (11th Cir.1999). And Green\u2019s speculation that race played a role in Collins\u2019s actions is insufficient to prove that Green was harassed because of his race. <em>See Mayfield v. Patterson Pump Co., </em>101 F.3d 1371, 1376 (11th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b934-4\">The district court also did not err by entering summary judgment against Green\u2019s complaints of racial discrimination and retaliation. The City submitted emails, memos, testimony from Collins and Assistant Police Chief Sharon Crowder, and the written disciplinary decision that established that Green was suspended for official misconduct. Green threatened to reprimand Crowder for exercising her rights under an anti-harassment policy and Green changed Crowder\u2019s job duties in retaliation for her participation in a pre-disciplinary hearing. Green and his secretary testified that Crowder ignored, officers\u2019 complaints, acted anxious, and was disorganized, but even if Green had legitimate reasons for changing Crowder\u2019s duties, Collins could act on his good faith belief that Green had retaliated against Crowder. <em>See EEOC v. Total Sys. Servs., Inc., </em>221 F.3d 1171, 1176 (11th Cir.2000). Green alleged that he was asked by the mayor if he was thought to be a \u201cmember of the Ku Klux Klan,\u201d but a stray remark of an official who did not participate in Green\u2019s disciplinary process did not create a genuine factual dispute about the legitimacy of the reasons for his suspension. <em>See Springer v. Convergys Customer Mgmt. Grp. Inc., </em>509 F.3d 1344, 1348-49 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b934-5\">Green argues that the close temporal proximity between the filing of his charge of discrimination and the commencement of his disciplinary proceeding provides circumstantial evidence that there is a causal connection between his protected activity and the adverse employment decision, but we disagree. Collins notified Green that he was being investigated for official misconduct on May 1, 2009, before Green filed his charge of discrimination on May 14, 2009. On May 29, 2009, Collins notified Green that he faced discipline for his actions against Crowder, and on June 9, 2009, Collins conducted Green\u2019s pre-disci-plinary hearing. The temporal proximity between Green\u2019s suspension and his protected activity can be attributed to the fact that he filed his charge on the same day that he issued a memo describing the changes in Crowder\u2019s job duties. Green could not \u201cinsulate [himself] against termination or discipline by preemptively making a discrimination complaint.\u201d <em>Alvarez v. Royal Atl. Developers, Inc., </em>610 F.3d 1253, 1270 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b934-6\">We AFFIRM the summary judgment in favor of the City and Collins.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
