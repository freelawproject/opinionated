On appeal, Charles argues that the district court committed clear error when it denied a joint recommendation for a reduction to Charles\u2019s offense level for his allegedly minor role in the offense under United States Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 3B1.2. Specifically, Charles alleges that the district court failed to properly analyze his role in the offense under the test provided in <em>United States v. Rodriguez De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930 (11th Cir.1999) (en banc) <em>(De </em>Varon). He also argues that the district court failed to consider his co-conspirator\u2019s more significant role in the larger criminal scheme. After careful consideration, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-21\">\u201c[A] district court\u2019s determination of whether a defendant qualifies for a minor role adjustment under the Guidelines is a finding of fact that will be. reviewed only for clear error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 934. The defendant' \u201cbears the burden at all times of establishing her role in the offense by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A defendant warrants a two-level reduction for playing a minor role in the offense if he is \u201cless, culpable than most other participants, but [his] role could not be described as minimal.\u201d USSG \u00a7 3B1.2 comment, n. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>5. A district court is not required to find a participant\u2019s role is minor merely because the government recommends such a finding. <em>See United States v. Erves, </em>880 F.2d 376, 381 (11th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b974-4\">Under <em>De Var\u00f3n, </em>a district court conducts a two-pronged analysis of the defen-' dant\u2019s conduct to determine whether a minor-role reduction applies. 175 F.3d at 940. First, \u201cthe district court must assess whether the defendant is a minor or minimal participant in relation to the relevant conduct attributed to [him] in calculating [his] base offense level.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The first prong does not evaluate whether he played a minor role in a larger conspiracy. <em>Id. </em>at 944. Second, the district court may assess a defendant\u2019s relative culpability compared to any other participants in the relevant conduct. <em>Id. </em>Under this prong, the court is limited to considering only those participants who were involved in the particular conduct for which the defendant was convicted. <em>Id. </em>The court does not take into account the role of any participants in any larger criminal conspiracy. <em>Id. </em>Furthermore, \u201c[t]he fact that a defendant\u2019s role may be less than that of other participants engaged in the relevant conduct may not be dispositive of role in the offense, since it is possible that none are minor or minimal participants.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b974-5\">Here, the district court did not clearly err in denying a minor-role adjustment. Although the district court made no factual findings as to the first <em>De Var\u00f3n </em>prong, \u201cthe sentencing judge has no duty to make any specific subsidiary factual findings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 939. \u201cSo long as the district court\u2019s decision is supported by the record and the court clearly resolves any <em>disputed </em>factual issues, a simple statement of the district court\u2019s conclusion is sufficient.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The facts set forth in the factual proffer signed by Charles provide sufficient support for denying the adjustment. According to the proffer, Charles \u201cagreed to help Wesly Compere use debit cards numbers and social security card numbers to obtain fraudulent income tax refunds and social security Retirement Income Benefits (RIB) payments.\u201d Charles allowed Compere to use addresses under his control in furtherance of this scheme and forwarded any payments and correspondence in exchange for part of the proceeds. Charles also sent text messages notifying Compere and other coconspirators of the arrival of such correspondence and passing along personal identification information like social security numbers and dates of birth. Charles was involved with fraudulent returns totaling $239,433.90. In short, the record supports the district court\u2019s finding that Charles did not play a minor role in the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-7\">Neither did the district court err when it considered Charles\u2019s culpability in the conduct for which he was convicted in comparison to that of Compere, his coconspirator. Charles asks this Court to consider Charles\u2019s role in Compere\u2019s larger criminal scheme. But under <em>De Var\u00f3n, </em>\u201cthe district court may consider only those participants who were involved <em>in the relevant conduct attributed to the defendant.\u201d </em>175 F.3d at 944 (emphasis added). The district court properly compared the financial loss and roles of Charles and Compere in the conduct for which Charles was convicted. We affirm the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
