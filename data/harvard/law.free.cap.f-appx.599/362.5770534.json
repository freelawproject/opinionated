On appeal, Hanna appears to challenge the district court\u2019s order closing the case and denying his motion for the appointment of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-25\">We review the dismissal of a lawsuit for failure to comply with the rules of the court for an abuse of discretion. <em>Betty K Agencies, Ltd. v. M/V MONADA, </em>432 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>1333, 1337 (11th Cir.2005). Under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a court may dismiss a case when the plaintiff fails to comply with procedural rules or a court order. Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(b). A federal district court has the inherent power to dismiss a case <em>sua sponte </em>under Rule 41(b). <em>Chambers v. NASCO, Inc., </em>501 U.S. 32, 48-49, 111 S.Ct. 2123, 115 L.Ed.2d 27 (1991). Although we liberally construe <em>pro se </em>pleadings, <em>pro se </em>litigants are nonetheless required to conform their pleadings to procedural rules. <em>Albra v. Advan, Inc., </em>490 F.3d 826, 829 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">Hanna filed a lawsuit against the State of Florida and eight individual defendants alleging deprivations of various constitutional rights in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. He moved for an order appointing counsel pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(1). Because Hanna had neither paid the filing fee nor moved to proceed <em>in forma pauperis, </em>the district court issued an order for Hanna to show cause why the case should not be closed. The order stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-6\">by May 9, 2014, Plaintiff shall SHOW CAUSE why the Court should not close this case due to Plaintiffs failure to pay the filing fee. Instead of filing a show-cause response, Plaintiff may pay the filing fee or submit a motion to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>by May 9, 2014.... Should Plaintiff fail to meet the May 9, 2014, deadline, the Court will close this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">Order to Show Cause, Apr. 24, 2014 (DE 6).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-9\">On April 28, 2014, Hanna filed a \u201cMotion to Show Cause File Response for Fee\u2019s and Cost,\u201d which the district court construed as a response to the show-cause order. The largely unintelligible motion provided no explanation for Hanna\u2019s failure to pay the filing fee. The next day the district court closed the ease. A week after the case was closed, Hanna moved in the district court to proceed <em>informa pau-peris. </em>Before any action was taken on the motion, Hanna filed a notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-12\">Upon review of the record and consideration of Hanna\u2019s brief, we affirm. In the show-cause order, the district court provided Hanna with three options: show cause why the case should not be dismissed, pay the filing fee, or submit a motion to proceed <em>informa pauperis. </em>Hanna elected to pursue the first option. But because his response failed to show cause why his case should not be dismissed, the district court acted within its discretion by closing the ease. <em>See Betty K Agencies, </em>432 F.3d at 1337; Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(b). Once the court decided to close the case, it properly denied Hanna\u2019s motion for the appointment of counsel as moot because the case was no longer pending.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b401-10\">. Hanna\u2019s motion to proceed <em>in forma pauper-is, </em>filed after the district court closed the case, has not been ruled upon and thus is not before us on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
