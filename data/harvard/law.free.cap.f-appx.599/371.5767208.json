The district court dismissed Rodriguez\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim. Fed. R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-22\">The district court did not abuse its discretion when it dismissed Rodriguez\u2019s third amended complaint. Rodriguez\u2019s complaint is neither short nor plain. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a)(2). The complaint is a typical shotgun-style pleading that consists of 93 paragraphs, some of which are repetitive, unintelligible, and replete with legal conclusions. <em>See Bell Atl Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1974, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007). Rodriguez\u2019s two-count complaint also failed to provide the School Board fair notice of its alleged wrongdoing. <em>See id. </em>at 555, 127 S.Ct. at 1964. In Count 1, Rodriguez alleged vaguely that the School Board engaged in \u201cDiscriminatory Practices\u201d in violation of \u201c42 U.S.C.... \u00a7 2000e-2 [Section 703] and seq.\u201d because it \u201cforg[o]t[ ] the laws related with the Civil Right of the Individuals in the employee and in the training ... [and] made the Wrong Decision.\u201d And in Count 2, Rodriguez alleged that the School Board committed \u201cother unlawful Employment Practices\u201d in violation of \u201c42 U.S.C_ 2000e-3 [Section 704] seq.\u201d because \u201che ... made contradictory charges against Plaintiff.\u201d The district court told <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>Rodriguez how to comply with the Rules of Civil Procedure; urged him to consult with an attorney; and warned him that his failure to comply would result in the dismissal of his complaint. <em>See Moon v. Newsome, </em>863 F.2d 835, 837 (11th Cir.1989). The district court did not abuse its discretion by dismissing Rodriguez\u2019s third amended complaint when he failed repeatedly to amend his complaint in compliance with the rules of procedure. <em>See McNeil v. United States, </em>508 U.S. 106, 113, 113 S.Ct. 1980, 1984, 124 L.Ed.2d 21 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">We AFFIRM the dismissal of Rodriguez\u2019s complaint.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
