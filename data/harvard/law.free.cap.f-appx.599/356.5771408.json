On February 9, 2007, the District Court sentenced Hillin to 40 months on the possession count and, consecutively to that sentence, 120 months on the remaining counts for a total sentence of 160 months. Hillin did not appeal from these convictions or sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-20\">On August 19, 2010, Hillin, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>filed a \u201cMotion to Correct the Record Nunc Pro Tunc.\u201d He asked the District Court to \u201ccorrect the sentence record\u201d because (1) \u201cthere exist significant sentencing disparities ... within the Circuit and Nationally\u201d; (2) the \u201cCourt possesses great discretion to fashion sentences particular to a defendant\u2019s needs and society\u2019s interests\u201d; (3) \u201cdefendant has exhibited remorse ... and is not likely to recidivate\u201d; and (4) \u201cthe least restrictive alternative necessary to achieve society\u2019s goals is reflected in personalized sentencing, and in concurrent sentencing significantly below the guidelines sentencing range.\u201d The District Court denied Hillin\u2019s motion without explanation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Hillin appeals from that ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-21\">Hillin\u2019s motion does not cite the legal authority pursuant to which he is seeking relief from his total sentence of 160 months. Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35, \u201cCorrecting or Reducing a Sentence,\u201d provides a district court, within 14 days after sentencing, to \u201ccorrect a sentence that resulted from arithmetical, technical, or other clear error,\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(a); or, on the Government\u2019s motion, to \u201creduc[e] a sentence for substantial assistance,\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(b). But Hillin\u2019s motion seeks relief on neither ground. In short, because the law does not provide the District Court with the power to grant the relief Hillin is seeking \u2014 the reduction of his total sentence, we must affirm the District Court\u2019s ruling on the ground that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to entertain Hillin\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b394-17\">. The order stated that \"[u]pon consideration, the court finds that the motion is due to be, and it hereby is, DENIED.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
