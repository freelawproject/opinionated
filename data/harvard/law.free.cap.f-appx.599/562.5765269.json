California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and <em>United States v. Flores, </em>632 F.3d 229 (5th Cir.2011). Santana-Rojas has not filed a response.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-17\">The record reflects that Santana-Rojas wishes to appeal his sentence only. <em>See United States v. Garcia, </em>483 F.3d 289, 291 (5th Cir.2007). Santana has completed the confinement portion of his sentence, however, and he has been removed from the United States and may not return. Therefore, the appeal is moot. <em>See United States v. Rosenbaum-Alanis, </em>483 F.3d 381, 382-83 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-19\">Counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED AS MOOT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b600-31\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R, 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
