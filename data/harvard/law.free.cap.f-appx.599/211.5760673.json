The district court also revoked a term of supervised release that had been imposed following Rivera\u2019s convictions in the District of Nebraska for bank fraud and illegal reentry and imposed a consecutive 12-month revocation sentence. Although he filed notices of appeal in both cases, Rivera\u2019s brief in these consolidated appeals challenges only the revocation sentence. He has therefore waived any challenge to his illegal reentry conviction and the associated sentence. <em>See United States v. Thames, </em>214 F.3d 608, 611 n. 3 (5th Cir. 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-23\">We review Rivera\u2019s revocation sentence under the \u201cplainly unreasonable\u201d standard. <em>See United States v. Miller, </em>634 F.3d 841, 843. (5th Cir.2011). Although Rivera acknowledges this court\u2019s holding in <em>Miller, </em>he argues that the \u201cplainly unreasonable\u201d standard used by this court is incorrect because it is based on a flawed interpreta<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>tion of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Rivera contends that the reasonableness standard established in <em>Booker </em>should be applied in the review of all criminal sentences, including revocation sentences. He concedes that his argument is foreclosed by <em>Miller, </em>but he raises the issue to preserve it for possible further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">Rivera\u2019s consecutive 12-month revocation sentence falls within the guidelines range, and it is consistent with the Sentencing Guidelines\u2019 policy regarding consecutive sentences. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.3(f), p.s.; \u00a7 7B1.4, p.s. The sentence was thus entitled to a presumption of reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Lopez-Velasquez, </em>526 F.3d 804, 808-09 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Candia, </em>454 F.3d 468, 471 (5th Cir.2006). To rebut the presumption of reasonableness, Rivera must show that the district court failed to account for a sentencing factor that should have been accorded substantial weight, gave substantial weight to an \u201cirrelevant or improper factor,\u201d or made \u201ca clear error of judgment in balancing [the] sentencing factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">As the district court noted, Rivera has a significant criminal history, which prompted the district court to express a concern for protecting the public and providing deterrence. Rivera\u2019s arguments regarding the overstated seriousness of the illegal reentry offense and his personal circumstances amount to a mere disagreement with the district court\u2019s balancing of the appropriate 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553 sentencing factors, and such is insufficient to overcome the presumption of reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Alvarado, </em>691 F.3d 592, 597 (5th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">In view of the foregoing, the judgments of the district court are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b249-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should riot be published and is not precedent except under dle limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
