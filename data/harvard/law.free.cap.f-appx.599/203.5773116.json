The district court determined that the claims raised in Amlee\u2019s petition arose under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 and that Amlee had not established that he was entitled to proceed under the savings clause of \u00a7 2255(e), which allows a federal prisoner to challenge his conviction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>under \u00a7 2241 if the remedies provided under \u00a7 2255 are \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d Accordingly, the district court dismissed the \u00a7 2241 petition for lack of jurisdiction, and Amlee now requests leave from this court to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) on appeal. He also requests a certif\u00edcate of appealability (COA), but no COA is required to proceed on appeal in a \u00a7 2241 proceeding, <em>see Padilla v. United States, </em>416 <em>F.3d </em>424, 425 (5th Cir.2005), and the COA motion is therefore DENIED as unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">To proceed IFP on appeal, Amlee must show that he is a pauper and that he will raise a nonfrivolous issue on appeal. <em>See </em>FED. R. APP. P. 24(a)(5); <em>Carson v. Polley, </em>689 F.2d 562, 586 (5th Cir.1982). A petitioner seeking to establish that his \u00a7 2255 remedy was inadequate or ineffective must make a claim (i) \u201cbased on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which establishes that the petitioner may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense\u201d that (ii) \u201cwas foreclosed by circuit law at the time when the claim should have been raised in the petitioner\u2019s trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion.\u201d <em>Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>248 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir.2001). We review a district court\u2019s dismissal of a \u00a7 2241 petition de novo. <em>Kinder v. Purdy, </em>222 F.3d 209, 212 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">Amlee concedes that he cannot meet the standard set forth in <em>Reyes-Requena, </em>but he asserts that he is actually innocent of the sentencing enhancements that were applied in his case and that the refusal to allow him to bring his claims under \u00a7 2241 would thus result in a miscarriage of jus-' tice. Unlike a claim that one has been convicted of a nonexistent offense or that one is actually innocent of the crime of conviction, a claim that one is actually innocent of a sentencing enhancement is not one that may be brought under \u00a7 2255\u2019s savings clause. <em>See Kinder, </em>222 F.3d at 213-14.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">In light of the foregoing, Amlee has identified no nonfrivolous issue for appeal. His IFP motion is DENIED, and the appeal is DISMISSED. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 &amp; n. 24 (5th Cir. 1997); <em>Carson, </em>689 F.2d at 586; 5TH CIR. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b241-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
