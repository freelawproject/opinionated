Munoz-Rodriguez moved to reduce his sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c), alleging that the district court unconstitutionally increased his mandatory-minimum sentence by sixty months under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) when it found that he brandished a firearm during his crime. According to Munoz-Rodriguez, the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Alleyne v. United States, </em>570 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2151, 186 L.Ed.2d 314 (2013), makes clear that only a jury may determine facts which increase the mandatory-minimum sentence. Upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-22\">We review <em>de novo </em>the question of whether the district court has jurisdiction to modify a sentence. <em>See United States v. Phillips, </em>597 F.3d 1190, 1194 n. 9 (11th Cir.2010). Under \u00a7 3582(c), the district court may only modify a sentence in three limited circumstances: (1) on motion of the Bureau of Prisons to reduce a prisoner\u2019s remaining time in custody; (2) in the case of a defendant whose guideline range has been lowered by the Sentencing Commission; or (3) to the extent otherwise provided by statute or Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35. Rule 35 allows the court to (a) correct an arithmetical, technical, or other clear error within fourteen days of sentencing, or (b) reduce a sentence based on substantial assistance upon the government\u2019s motion within one year of sentencing. Fed.R. Crim.P. 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-23\">The district court lacked jurisdiction to reconsider Munoz-Rodriguez\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 3582(c). The motion for reconsideration was not made by the BOP or the government. Munoz-Rodriguez\u2019s motion was brought more than fourteen days after sentencing. Finally, his motion did not concern a guideline range that had been subsequently lowered by the Sentencing Commission.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thus, Munoz-Rodriguez\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"940\">*940</page-number>motion was based on an alleged constitutional violation to which \u00a7 3582(c) is inapplicable. <em>See United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 782 (11th Cir.2000). As suggested by the district court, his constitutional challenge might be properly made through another procedural vehicle, such as a timely motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. Independent of that possibility, \u00a7 3582(c) is not available to Munoz-Rodriguez on his current challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b977-18\">. The United States notes in its brief before this Court that, effective November 1, 2014, Amendment 782 to the Sentencing Guidelines may reduce the base offense level given to Munoz-Rodriguez\u2019s sentence from 26 to 24. <em>See </em>UniteJ States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 2D 1.1 (c)(8). While the amendment became effective after the motion at issue here was filed and therefore does not impact our holding in this case, it may offer Munoz-Rodri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"940\">*940</page-number>guez relief in a future motion under \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
