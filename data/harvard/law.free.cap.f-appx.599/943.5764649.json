Spaulding based his motion on Amendment 782 to the Sentencing Guidelines. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-8\">Spaulding disappeared before he was indicted for conspiring to possess with intent to distribute at least five kilograms of cocaine, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), 841(b)(1)(A), 846, attempting to possess with intent to distribute at least five kilograms of cocaine, <em>id., </em>and carrying a firearm during and in relation to drug trafficking, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(i). After his arrest, Spaulding moved unsuccessfully to dismiss his indictment based on the denial of his right to a speedy trial in violation of the Sixth Amendment. At trial, a jury rejected Spaulding\u2019s defense of entrapment and found him guilty of the firearms offense and of conspiring to and attempting to distribute cocaine, but the jury found that Spaulding\u2019s drug crimes involved only 500 grams of cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-9\">At sentencing, the district court relied on the jury\u2019s finding as to drug quantity. Although the presentence investigation report assigned Spaulding an offense level of 32 based on the 7 kilograms of cocaine that he arranged to purchase initially, the district court sustained Spaulding\u2019s objection to the amount. The district court determined that the jury had a \u201crational basis\u201d to find that Spaulding had negotiated to buy a lesser quantity of cocaine on several occasions, and the district court assigned Spalding an offense level of 30 based on a drug amount of 3.5 to 5 kilograms of cocaine. With a criminal history of III, Spaulding had an advisory sentencing range between 121 and 151 months of imprisonment for his drug crimes and a mandatory consecutive sentence of 60 months of imprisonment for his firearm offense. The district court sentenced Spaulding to 181 months of imprisonment based on the significant amount of cocaine involved, his participation in criminal activities during a term of probation, and his criminal history, which included a conviction for aggravated assault for shooting a man and a charge for essentially identical misconduct that had been <em>nol prossed. See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b982-11\">Spaulding moved to reduce his sentence to 157 months, but the district court denied the motion. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 3582(c)(2). The district court reduced Spaulding\u2019s offense level by two levels and calculated a revised sentencing range of 97 to 121 months with a consecutive term of 60 months for his firearm offense. The district court refused to reduce Spaulding\u2019s sentence because he had been given \u201cthe benefit of the doubt\u201d and found responsible for \u201cless than five kilograms\u201d of cocaine; his sentence was \u201cfair and just\u201d under his new sentencing range; and a shorter sentence \u201cwould not promote respect for the law,\u201d \u201cafford adequate deterrence,\u201d or \u201cprotect the public\u201d in the light of the \u201csignificant amount of cocaine\u201d involved and his \u201csignificant criminal history.\u201d The district court found that \u201cSpaulding\u2019s post-conviction efforts at rehabilitation\u201d did \u201cnot merit a reduction in what was [already] a lenient sentence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b983-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"945\">*945</page-number>The district court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Spaulding\u2019s motion to reduce. Spaulding argues that the district court ignored its earlier determination that the jury\u2019s verdict established the amount of cocaine and treated that verdict as a lucky break that did not apply to the motion to reduce, but the district court did not disturb its original determination that Spaulding\u2019s offense involved less than five kilograms of cocaine, <em>see United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780 (11th Cir.2000). Based on the amended drug quantity table, the district court correctly assigned Spaulding an offense level of 28, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(6), which resulted in a sentencing range between 97 and 121 months of imprisonment, <em>id. </em>Ch. 5, Pt. A. <em>See Bravo, </em>203 F.3d at 780.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-5\">The district court reasonably determined that a reduction of Spaulding\u2019s sentence would not serve the statutory purposes of sentencing. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Spaulding argues that the purposes of the crack cocaine amendments, his good behavior \u201cbetween the commission of [his] offense [and] his arrest,\u201d and his postconviction efforts at rehabilitation all weigh in favor of granting his motion to reduce, but we do not reweigh the sentencing factors, <em>United States v. Saac, </em>632 F.3d 1203, 1214-15 (11th Cir.2011). We cannot say that the district court clearly erred in weighing the sentencing factors by imposing a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b983-6\">We AFFIRM the denial of Spaulding\u2019s motion to reduce his sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
