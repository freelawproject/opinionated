The district court granted Appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) based on a conclusion that Moore-Ahmed\u2019s civil complaint was not filed within ninety calendar days of her receipt of a right-to-sue letter from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, as required by statute.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It is undisputed that the complaint was stamped as \u201cfiled\u201d by the district court clerk and entered into the official docket on October 9, 2013, two days after the statutory limitation period expired. \u201cCourts within this circuit have repeatedly dismissed [such] cases....\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">Moore-Ahmed\u2019s sole argument on appeal is that we should treat the complaint as having been filed on October 7, 20\u00cd3, within the limitation period, because she purports that the district court clerk physically received it on that date. Our court has recognized \u201cthe widely accepted definition that a \u2018paper is filed when it is delivered to the proper official and by him received <em>and </em>filed.\u2019\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We have also held that in some circumstances, \u201cwhen [a complaint] is in the custody of the clerk within the time required by statute, [it] has been \u2018filed\u2019 within the requisite time despite the clerk\u2019s failure to <em>actually </em>\u2018file\u2019 [it].\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In this case, however, the district court expressly determined that Moore-Ahmed failed to establish that the complaint had been delivered to the clerk on October 7 to overcome the \u201cclear record of the [October 9] filing date\u201d evidenced in the docket and on the face of the complaint itself. Moore-Ahmed\u2019s argument is thus unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-10\">Having considered Moore-Ahmed\u2019s brief, the record, and the applicable law, we conclude that the district court correctly granted Appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss. Appellee\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED and the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. Appellee\u2019s alternative motion for an extension of time to file a merits brief is DENIED as unnecessary.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b264-6\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
