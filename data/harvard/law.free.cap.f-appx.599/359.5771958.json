Walker appeals the district court\u2019s order granting Financial Recovery Services, Inc.\u2019s (FRS) motion to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. Walker argues that the district court improperly found her case to be moot after she received and rejected an offer of judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 68. The district court based its finding on an offer that would have provided her complete relief on her individual claims while giving no relief to the putative class. Because the district court contravened our recent decision in <em>Stein v. Buccaneers Limited Partnership, </em>772 F.3d 698 (11th Cir.2014), we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">When reviewing a dismissal of a complaint as moot, we review factual findings for clear error and the legal issue <em>de novo. Id. </em>at 701. In <em>Stein, </em>the named plaintiffs in a putative class action received offers of judgment under Rule 68 before moving for class certification. <em>Id. </em>at 700-01. The plaintiffs rejected those offers. <em>Id. </em>at 701. This Court held, in one of two alternative holdings, that the unaccepted offers of judgment did not render the named plaintiffs\u2019 complaint moot. <em>Id. </em>at 704. Based on this precedent, we are bound to hold that FRS\u2019s offer of judgment did not render Walker\u2019s complaint moot, and that the district court erred when it dismissed for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-9\">FRS argues that the facts of this case are distinguishable from <em>Stein, </em>It argues that while the defendant\u2019s offers in <em>Stein </em>were deemed revoked if not accepted and the defendant did not request that the district court enter judgment on the terms of its offers, FRS continued to stand behind its offer and requested that the district court provide Walker with complete relief by entering judgment. We are not persuaded that these factual differences should alter our analysis. <em>Stein </em>broadly held that \u201c[gjiving controlling <em>effect to </em>an unaccepted Rule 68 offer ... is flatly inconsistent with the rule.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 702. And the <em>Stein </em>Court adopted the reasoning of four Justices in <em>Genesis Healthcare Corp. v. Symczyk, </em>569 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 1523, 185 L.Ed.2d 636 (2013). Those Justices specifically stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AZnX\">an unaccepted offer of judgment cannot moot a case. When a plaintiff rejects such an offer \u2014 however good the terms \u2014 her interest in the lawsuit remains just what it was before. And so too does the court\u2019s ability to grant her relief. An unaccepted settlement offer \u2014 like any unaccepted contract offer \u2014 is a legal nullity, with no operative effect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b398-13\"><em>Id. </em>at 1533 (Kagan, J., dissenting). This language does not allow for the slim factual distinction FRS asks us to attempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-14\">Even if there were a persuasive way to distinguish the facts of this case from <em>Stein\u2019s </em>first alternative holding, <em>Stein\u2019s </em>second alternative holding would still bind us. The <em>Stein </em>Court held that even assuming a putative class representative\u2019s individual claim was mooted, \u201ca Rule 68 offer of full relief to the named plaintiff does not moot a class action, even if the offer\u2019precedes a class-certification motion, so long as the named plaintiff has not failed to diligently pursue class certification.\u201d 772 F.3d at 707. FRS asks us to \u201creconsider[ ] or modiiy[ ] ... the holding in <em>Stein,\u201d </em>but \u201cwe are bound to follow a prior binding precedent unless and until it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>is overruled by this court en banc or by the Supreme Court.\u201d <em>United States v. Vega-Castillo, </em>540 F.3d 1235, 1236 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam) (quotation marks omitted).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">We reverse the order of dismissal for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"Ad0\">. FRS also argues that a recent Fifth Circuit opinion, <em>Fontenot v. McCraw, </em>777 F.3d 741 (5th Cir.2015), undermines a case the <em>Stein </em>panel relied upon, <em>Zeidman v. J. Ray McDermott &amp; Co., </em>651 F.2d 1030 (5th Cir. 1981). However, while <em>Zeidman </em>was binding precedent on the <em>Stein </em>panel, <em>see Bonner v. City of Prichard, </em>661 F.2d 1206, 1210 (11th Cir. 1981), <em>Fontenot </em>is not, <em>see, e.g., United States v. Schultz, </em>565 F.3d 1353, 1360 n. 4 (11th Cir.2009) (per curiam). The <em>Fontenot </em>decision is hardly a sufficient reason to overrule our Court's binding precedent from <em>Stein.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
