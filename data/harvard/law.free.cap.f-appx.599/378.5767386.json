In her complaint, Archer alleged that the defendants caused her arrest in violation of the First and Fourth Amendments and also asserted false arrest and malicious prosecution claims based on state law. Having reviewed the record and considered the arguments of the parties in their briefs, we AFFIRM the grant of summary judgment for the reasons stated in the district court\u2019s thorough and well-reasoned order entered November 4, 2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-19\">We also point out that the district court correctly rejected plaintiff Archer\u2019s argument that defendant Captain Logan was acting \u201cunder color of state law\u201d simply because his position in the Police Department <em>may </em>have gained him some preferential treatment by the District Attorney\u2019s Office investigator or allowed him a measure of influence in the initiation of a criminal prosecution. We agree with the district court that Archer has cited no authority indicating that a state official acting purely in his private capacity acts under color of state law simply \u201cbecause he may have gained an indirect advantage by virtue of his official post.\u201d We add that our precedent supports the district court\u2019s rejection of that argument on this record. <em>See Myers v. Bowman, </em>713 F.3d 1319, 1331 (11th Cir.2013) (defendant magistrate judge did not act under color of state law even though his \u201cposition as a magistrate judge affected [police officer\u2019s] decision to pursue the [plaintiffs],\u201d and he instructed another officer during the arrest, because arrest was not \u201cmade possible only because [defendant] was clothed with the authority of state law\u201d (alteration adopted and quotation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-20\">We additionally address, and find unpersuasive, plaintiff Archer\u2019s contention that the district court \u2014 in finding no supervisory liability as to defendant Major Ellison\u2014 erred in failing to address her claim that Ellison directly participated in the alleged First and Fourth Amendment violations. Archer has pointed to no evidence creating a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether Ellison personally participated in the investigation that culminated in her indictment and arrest. <em>See Mann v. Taser </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number><em>Int\u2019l, Inc., </em>588 F.3d 1291, 1308 (11th Cir. 2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
