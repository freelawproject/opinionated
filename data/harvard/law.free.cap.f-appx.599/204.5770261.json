The district court also revoked a term of supervised release that had been imposed following a previous illegal reentry conviction and imposed a revocation sentence of 24 months of imprisonment, with 12 months of the sentence to run consecutive to the 33-month sentence that was imposed for the immigration offenses. Although he filed notices of appeal in both cases, Chavi-ra\u2019s attorney-prepared brief challenges only the revocation sentence. However, to the extent that Chavira intended to appeal the non-revocation sentence, his argument is waived because it is insufficiently briefed. <em>See </em>Fed. R. App. P. 28(a)(9); <em>United States v. Scroggins, </em>599 F.3d 433, 446 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-9\">Ordinarily, revocation sentences are reviewed under the \u201cplainly unreasonable\u201d standard. <em>United States v. Miller, </em>634 F.3d 841, 843 (5th Cir.2011). We do not address Chavira\u2019s argument that this court should not employ the plainly unreasonable standard because Chavira did not preserve his arguments in the district court and the appeal is thus governed by the plain error standard of review. <em>See United States v. Whitelaw, </em>580 F.3d 256, 260 (5th Cir.2009). To demonstrate plain error, Chavira must show a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and that affects his substantial rights. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If he makes such a showing, this court has the discretion to correct the error but only if it affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b243-14\">The revocation sentence fell within the advisory range and was consistent with the Sentencing Guidelines\u2019 policy regarding consecutive sentences. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.3(f), p.s.; \u00a7 7B1.4, p.s. The sentence was thus entitled to a presumption of reasonableness. <em>United States v. Candia, </em>454 F.3d 468, 473 (5th Cir.2006). Chavira had an extensive criminal history, resulting in 20 criminal history points and a criminal history category of VI. His arguments regarding the overstated seriousness of the offense and his personal circumstances amount to a mere disagreement with the district court\u2019s balance of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553 sentencing factors, and this court will not second-guess the district court\u2019s balancing of those factors. <em>See United States v. McElwee, </em>646 F.3d 328, 344-45 (5th Cir.2011). Chavira has not shown that the revocation sentence is plainly erroneous. <em>See Whitelaw, </em>580 F.3d at 260-61. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b243-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
