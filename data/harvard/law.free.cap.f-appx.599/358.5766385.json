On appeal, Lowry argues that the district court erroneously sentenced him as an armed career criminal because his 2003 conviction for possession with intent to sell or deliver cocaine, in violation of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 893.13, was not a \u201cserious drug offense\u201d within the meaning of the ACCA. He also argues that the district court\u2019s imposition of a sentencing enhancement based on prior convictions violated his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights because the prior convictions were not charged in his indictment or admitted to at his change-of-plea hearing. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-22\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-23\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>questions of statutory interpretation.\u201d <em>United States v. Manpin, </em>520 F.3d 1304, 1306 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam). The ACCA provides that a person who is convicted of being a previously-convicted felon in possession of a firearm and has three previous convictions for a \u201cserious drug offense\u201d shall be sentenced to a minimum of 15 years\u2019 imprisonment. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1). The statute includes in its definition of a serious drug offense \u201can offense under State law, involving manufacturing, distributing, or possessing with intent to manufacture or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>distribute, a controlled substance ... for which a maximum term of imprisonment of ten years or more is prescribed by law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 924(e)(2)(A)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">At sentencing, the district court found that Lowry had three previous convictions for serious drug offenses. Lowry argues that a defendant\u2019s knowledge of the illicit nature of the substance is a necessary implied element of a serious drug offense under the ACCA. Thus, he argues that his 2008 conviction for possession with intent to sell or deliver cocaine, in violation of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 893.13(1), was not a serious drug offense because it was obtained under a state statutory scheme that does not require such knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">This argument is directly foreclosed by this Court\u2019s holding in <em>United States v. Smith, </em>775 F.3d 1262 (11th Cir.2014), in which we held that a conviction under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 893.13(1) is \u00e1 serious drug offense under the ACCA. <em>Id. </em>at 1268. Our holding was based on the plain language of \u00a7 924(e), which defines a serious drug offense and neither expressly nor implicitly requires the <em>mens rea </em>element that Lowry argues his 2003 conviction lacks. <em>Id. </em>at 1267. Thus, we affirm the district court\u2019s finding that Lowry had three prior convictions for serious drug offenses under the ACCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">We turn next to Lowry\u2019s argument that his sentence is unconstitutional because the government did not charge his prior convictions in its indictment and he did not admit to their existence at his change-of-plea hearing. \u201cAlthough it is ordinarily true that all elements of a crime must be alleged by indictment and either proved beyond a reasonable doubt or admitted by a defendant, there is an exception for prior convictions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1266 (citing <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 247, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 1232-33, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998)). \u201cNeither the Fifth Amendment nor the Sixth Amendment prevents the district court from finding the fact of [Lowry\u2019s] prior convictions, or using them to designate him an Armed Career Criminal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(alterations adopted) (quoting <em>United States v. Gibson, </em>434 F.3d 1234, 1246 (11th Cir.2006)). Thus, the district court\u2019s imposition of the ACCA enhancement did not violate Lowry\u2019s constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
