He contends that the government violated its own regulations, his right to due process, the Administrative Procedures Act (\u201cAPA\u201d), and the Immigration and Nationality Act by failing to process his application for naturalization within a reasonable time. He seeks a hearing or, alternatively, an equitable order requiring the government to process his application and grant citizenship nunc pro tunc. According to Saucedo Montenegro, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 and the APA vested the district court with jurisdiction to consider his claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-22\">Saucedo Montenegro does not dispute the district court\u2019s determination that his claims are not cognizable under Section 2241. To the extent he asserts that his petition should be construed instead under the APA and Section 1331, he also fails to address the district court\u2019s dispositive rulings that his claims are time barred by a jurisdictional statute of limitations and that he lacks standing to challenge the denial of his application as an aggravated felon. He thus has abandoned any challenge to these determinations by the district court. <em>See Soadjede v.
