On appeal he claims his sentence is substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">Espindola-Pineda contends that U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 is flawed because it lacks an empirical basis and results in the double-counting of a criminal record. He maintains that his sentence is greater than necessary to fulfill the statutory sentencing goals for his nonviolent offense and does not account for his difficult childhood and his sympathetic reason for reentering the country.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">We have rejected Espindola-Pineda\u2019s theory that \u00a7 2L1.2 results in double-counting, <em>United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.2009), and that his sentence is greater than necessary to meet the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) goals because illegal reentry is a nonviolent offense involving only \u201cthe act of crossing a line,\u201d <em>United States v. Aguirre-Villa, </em>460 F.3d 681, 683 (5th Cir.2006). We have rebuffed the argument that within-guidelines sentences calculated under \u00a7 2L1.2 should not be presumed reasonable on appeal because \u00a7 2L1.2 lacks an empirical basis. <em>United States v. Ellis, </em>720 F.3d 220, 228 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 681, 187 L.Ed.2d 555 (2013). Espindola-Pine-da can rebut the presumption only by showing that his sentence fails to account for a factor that should receive significant weight, gives significant weight to an improper or irrelevant factor, or represents a clear error of judgment in balancing the factors. <em>See United States v. Tuma, </em>738 F.3d 681, 695 (5th Cir.2013), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 2875, 189 L.Ed.2d 835 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-13\">The district court heard the parties\u2019 positions, considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and concluded that the sentence was appropriate. Espindola-Pineda has not shown that his difficult childhood and sympathetic motive for reentry were factors not accounted for in the sentence that should have received great weight. Because Espindola-Pineda has not rebutted the appellate presumption that his within-guidelines sentence was reasonable or demonstrated that it is the result of an abuse of discretion, <em>see Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007), the judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b200-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
