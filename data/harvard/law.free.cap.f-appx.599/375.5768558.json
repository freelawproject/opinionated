Fodor contends that Eastern failed to properly serve or verify its bill of costs and that the district court improperly awarded costs while his appeal from the court\u2019s grant of summary judgment was pending in this Court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b413-26\">Eastern\u2019s bill of costs requested (1) $838.05 for the cost of copying various materials, and (2) $6,263.23 for the cost of obtaining transcripts of a discovery hearing and two days of Fodor\u2019s deposition.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The bill of costs included a sworn declaration from Eastern\u2019s attorney that the costs were correct and necessarily incurred and that it had served the bill of costs on Fodor through prepaid first class mail.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-27\">Fodor did not file any objections to the bill of costs. The clerk taxed $6,263.23 for the cost of obtaining transcripts, but did not tax the $338.05 for the cost of copying materials. Fodor asked the district court to review the clerk\u2019s action. He argued that Eastern had failed to serve the bill of costs, that the bill of costs was not properly verified, and that Eastern was not yet the \u201cprevailing party\u201d because his summary judgment appeal was still pending in this Court. The district court denied Fo-dor\u2019s motion. This is his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-28\">We review a district court\u2019s decision about whether to award costs to the prevailing party for an abuse of discretion. <em>Mathews v. Crosby, </em>480 F.3d 1265, 1276 (11th Cir.2007). \u201cAn abuse of discretion occurs if the trial judge bases an award or denial upon findings of fact that are clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b413-29\">Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(d)(1) provides that litigation costs, other than attorney\u2019s fees, should be awarded to the prevailing party \u201c[ujnless a federal statute, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>these rules, or a court order provides otherwise.\u201d Notwithstanding the \u201cstrong presumption that the prevailing party will be awarded costs,\u201d we have recognized that they \u201cmay not exceed those permitted by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1920.\u201d <em>Mathews, </em>480 F.3d at 1276. That statute provides in relevant part that a federal court may tax as costs \u201c[flees for printed or electronically recorded transcripts necessarily obtained for use in the case.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1920(2). Before the court may tax costs against the losing party, the party claiming items of cost must make an affidavit, either personally or through counsel with knowledge of the facts, that such items are correct and necessarily incurred in the case, that the fees were actually charged, and that services were necessarily performed. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1924.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">Here, the district court did not abuse its discretion in awarding costs to Eastern, the prevailing party in this action. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(d)(1). The general rule that a notice of appeal divests the district court of jurisdiction over a case \u201cdoes not apply to collateral matters not affecting the questions presented on appeal.\u201d <em>Weaver v. Fla. Power &amp; Light Co., </em>172 F.3d 771, 773 (11th Cir.1999). Fodor\u2019s previous appeal to this Court, <em>see </em>2015 WL 424284, did not relate to the taxation of costs, so the district court retained jurisdiction over it as a \u201ccollateral matter.\u201d <em>See Weaver, </em>172 F.3d at 773.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">The clerk\u2019s taxing of costs associated with obtaining transcripts that were necessarily obtained and actually used by Eastern did not exceed those permitted by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1920(2). Fodor submitted no evidence that Eastern failed to serve him with its bill of costs, and the record reflects that service was in fact made through prepaid first class mail. The record also reflects that Eastern complied with the verification provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1924.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b413-20\">. Last month, we affirmed the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. <em>See Fodor v. E. Shipbldg. Grp., </em>No. 14-11713, 598 Fed.Appx. 693, 2015 WL 424284 (11th Cir. Feb. 3, 2015) (unpublished).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b413-30\">. Eastern relied on the discovery hearing transcript in a motion to compel a two-day deposition of Fodor with a special master and for sanctions. It relied on the deposition transcripts in its motion for summary judgment. Both of those motions were granted.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
