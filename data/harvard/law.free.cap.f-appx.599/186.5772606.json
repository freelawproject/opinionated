Almanza-Martinez does not challenge the determination that he was ineligible for asylum because of an untimely application and that he did not merit protection under the Convention Against Torture. By failing to brief those issues, he has waived them. <em>See Thuri v. Ashcroft, </em>380 F.3d 788, 793 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-9\">Because the BIA relied on the decision of the immigration judge (\u201cIJ\u201d), we review both the IJ\u2019s decision and the order of the BIA. <em>See Wang v. Holder, </em>569 F.3d 531, 536 (5th Cir.2009). We review for substantial evidence the decision to deny withholding of removal and will not reverse unless the record compels it. <em>Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 339, 344 (5th Cir.2005). To be entitled to withholding of removal, a petitioner must show a clear probability of persecution, i.e., that it is more likely than not that his life or freedom will be threatened by persecution based on one of five enumerated grounds, including membership in a particular social group. <em>Roy v. Ashcroft, </em>389 F.3d 132, 138 (5th Cir.2004); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-14\">Almanza asserts that the IJ ignored significant evidence establishing past persecution, including death threats to his son. He also complains that the IJ engaged in a highly speculative analysis by failing to ascertain whether he was a member of a particular social group, specifically landowners returning from the United States to Mexico.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-15\">A particular social group is one that has \u201csocial visibility,\u201d meaning that \u201cmembers of a society perceive those with the characteristic in question as members of a social group,\u201d and \u201cparticularity,\u201d meaning that the group \u201ccan accurately be described in a manner sufficiently distinct that the group would be recognized, in the society in question, as a discrete class of persons.\u201d <em>Orellana-Monson v. Holder, </em>685 F.3d 511, 519 (5th Cir.2012) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). The BIA\u2019s interpretation of the term \u201cparticular social group\u201d is entitled to deference. <em>Id. </em>at 520-22.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-16\">We have declined to recognize the wealthy or persons who earn a living as a protected group. <em>Castillo-Enriquez v. Holder, </em>690 F.3d 667, 668 (5th Cir.2012). Although Almanza-Martinez cites an alleged death threat against his son and attempted violent crimes against his family in support of his claim of past persecution, he fails to show that those acts stem from anything more than opportunistic criminal motives or that the threat resulted in any harm to him or his family. <em>See Arce v. Holder, </em>449 Fed.Appx. 404, 406 (5th Cir. 2011). Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s determination that Almanza offered nothing more than bare claims of past persecution and did not establish a clear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>probability of persecution based on his membership in a particular social group if he were returned to Mexico. <em>See Roy, </em>389 F.3d at 138. The BIA correctly denied his petition for withholding of removal. <em>See Zhang, </em>432 F.3d at 344; \u00a7 208.16(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b225-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
