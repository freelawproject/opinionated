Singh petitions this court for review of an order of the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) upholding the Immigration Judge\u2019s (IJ\u2019s) determination that he was not entitled to asylum, withholding of removal, or protection under the Convention Against Torture (CAT) because his claims were not credible.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He argues that he explained many of the discrepancies that were in his testimony and that existed between his testimony and written items. He also complains that he was not given an opportunity to explain another inconsistency and insists that his testimony was both credible and sufficient to support his request for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-19\">We \u201creview only the BIA\u2019s decision, unless the IJ\u2019s decision has some impact on\u201d that decision. <em>Wang v. Holder, </em>569 F.3d 531, 536 (5th Cir.2009). We review the factual determination that an alien is not eligible for asylum, withholding of removal, or CAT relief under the substantial evidence standard. <em>See Chen v. Gonzales, </em>470 F.3d 1131, 1134 (5th Cir.2006). Under this standard, we may not reverse an immigration court\u2019s factual findings unless \u201cthe evidence was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could conclude against it.\u201d <em>Wang, </em>569 F.3d at 537.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-20\">An adverse credibility determination may be supported by <em>\u201cany </em>inconsistency or omission,\u201d provided that \u201cthe totality of the circumstances establishes that an asylum applicant is not credible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 538 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Our review of the record as a whole shows that the evidence does not compel a conclusion contrary to that reached by the IJ and BIA on the issue whether Singh was credible. <em>See id. </em>at 537. Consequently, his petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b258-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
