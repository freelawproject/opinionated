Sales contends the district court erred in applying a two-level aggravating-role enhancement, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(c), because the facts are insufficient to support the enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-18\">Section 3Bl.l(c) provides a two-level increase \u201c[i]f the defendant was an organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor in any criminal activity\u201d that involved fewer than five participants or was not \u201cotherwise extensive\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 3Bl.l(a) and (b). U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(c). A defendant\u2019s assertion of control over only one other participant is sufficient to sustain a \u00a7 3Bl.l(c) role enhancement. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3B1.1, comment, (n.2); <em>United States v. Mandhai, </em>375 F.3d 1243, 1248 (11th Cir.2004). A \u201cparticipant\u201d is a person who is criminally responsible for the offense, even if not convicted. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1, comment, (n.l). In <em>Mandhai, </em>we determined that the district court properly applied a \u00a7 3Bl.l(c) enhancement where the defendant recruited one other individual into a terrorist plot, prompted that individual to purchase weapons, and briefed him on the bombing plan. <em>Mandhai </em>375 F.3d at 1248.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-19\">Additionally, the commentary to \u00a7 3B1.1 sets out several factors for courts to consider in determining if one is an organizer or leader, as opposed to a mere manager or supervisor, including the following: (1) the defendant\u2019s exercise of decision making authority; (2) recruiting accomplices; (3) the claimed right to a larger share of the proceeds; (4) the degree of participation in planning or organizing the crime; and (5) the degree of control and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>authority exercised over others. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1, comment, (n.4).</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">Sufficient facts support the district court\u2019s application of the \u00a7 3B 1.1(c) aggravating-role enhancement.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Sales, along with one other participant, organized and planned the robbery. Sales recruited a third co-conspirator. Similar to the defendant in <em>Mandhai, </em>who exercised control or influence over a recruit by prompting him to buy a weapon and briefing him on the bombing plot, Sales discussed the robbery with his recruit and directed him where and when to drive. <em>See Mandhai, </em>375 F.3d at 1248. Additionally, Sales decided how to compensate each participant from the robbery\u2019s proceeds and planned to keep the bulk of the proceeds for himself. Accordingly, the district court did not clearly err<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in determining that Sales was subject to an aggravating-role enhancement under \u00a7 3Bl.l(c). We affirm Sales\u2019 total sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b895-8\">. While Sales contends the Government did not prove the facts relied on for the enhancement with \u201creliable and specific evidence,\u201d see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Cataldo, </em>171 F.3d 1316, 1321 (11th Cir.1999), Sales admitted the facts as set forth in the PSI at sentencing. <em>See </em>Sentencing Transcript at 4-5. Thus, the facts were undisputed and met the \u201creliable and specific evidence\u201d standard.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b895-21\">. We review for clear error the district court\u2019s determination that a defendant is subject to an aggravating-role enhancement under \u00a7 3B 1.1(c). <em>United States v. Jiminez, </em>224 F.3d 1243, 1250-51 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
