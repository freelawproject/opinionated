Cooks, a state prisoner proceeding <em>pro se, </em>appeals the <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. In his complaint, Cooks alleged that the Florida Department of Corrections (\u201cFDOC\u201d) violated his constitutional rights by keeping him in its custody without possessing certain probable cause affidavits that led to his arrest.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, Cooks sought (1) a declaration that the FDOC\u2019s actions violated his rights; (2) an injunction directing the FDOC to contact the clerk of the sentencing court and state that Cooks would be immediately released from the FDOC\u2019s custody; and (3) compensatory and punitive damages. Upon review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-24\">We review a district court\u2019s decision to dismiss for failure to state a claim under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A <em>de novo, </em>taking the allegations in the complaint as true. <em>Boxer X v. Harris, </em>437 F.3d 1107, 1110 (11th Cir.2006). In addition, we liberally construe Cooks\u2019s <em>pro se </em>pleadings, holding them to a less stringent standard than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"941\">*941</page-number>those drafted by an attorney. <em>Tannenbaum v. United States, </em>148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b979-5\">The Prison Litigation Reform Act, in \u00a7 1915A, provides that the district court \u201cshall review, before docketing, if feasible or, in any event, as soon as practicable after docketing, a complaint in a civil action in which a prisoner seeks redress from a governmental entity or officer or employee of a governmental entity.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(a). Upon review, the district court must dismiss the complaint if it fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. <em>Id. </em>\u201cA complaint is subject to dismissal for failure to state a claim if the allegations, taken as true, show the plaintiff is not entitled to relief.\u201d <em>Jones v. Bock, </em>549 U.S. 199, 215, 127 S.Ct. 910, 920, 166 L.Ed.2d 798 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b979-6\">A prisoner is barred from challenging the legality of his conviction or confinement in a suit for damages under \u00a7 1983 if (1) the action, if successful, would demonstrate the invalidity of the underlying conviction or sentence; and (2) his conviction or sentence has not been \u201creversed on direct appeal, expunged by executive order, declared invalid by a state tribunal authorized to make such determination, or called into question by a federal court\u2019s issuance of a writ of habeas corpus.\u201d <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 2372, 129 L.E.2d 383 (1994). As the Supreme Court stressed in <em>Wilkinson v. Dotson, </em>544 U.S. 74, 125 S.Ct. 1242, 161 L.Ed.2d 253 (2005), we must \u201censure that state prisoners use only habeas corpus (or similar state) remedies when they seek to invalidate the duration of their confinement \u2014 either directly through an injunction compelling speedier release or indirectly through a judicial determination that necessarily implies the unlawfulness of the State\u2019s custody.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 81,125 S.Ct. at 1247.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-12\">The district court did not err in dismissing Cooks\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim because his claims are not cognizable under \u00a7 1983. In his complaint, Cooks challenged the very fact of his physical imprisonment, and for relief, he sought a determination that he was entitled to immediate release from imprisonment as well as damages based on his unconstitutional imprisonment. Because Cooks did not assert or demonstrate that his conviction or sentence had been invalidated, he could not bring his claims under \u00a7 1983, and his sole federal remedy was to seek a writ of habeas corpus. <em>See Wilkinson, </em>544 U.S. at 81-82, 125 S.Ct. at 1248; <em>Heck, </em>512 U.S. at 486-87, 114 S.Ct. at 2372; <em>Preiser v. Rodriguez, </em>411 U.S. 475, 489, 500, 93 S.Ct. 1827, 1836, 1841, 36 L.Ed.2d 439 (1973). Accordingly, the allegations in Cooks\u2019s complaint, liberally construed and taken as true, show that he is not entitled to relief.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See Jones, </em>549 U.S. at 215, 127 S.Ct. at 920.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b978-17\">. In particular, Cooks cites Fla. Stat. \u00a7 944.17(5), which provides that the FDOC must refuse to accept any individual for imprisonment unless the committing authority furnishes such affidavits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b979-7\">. Furthermore, it appears that Fla. Stat. \u00a7 944.17(5) does not \"confer a liberty interest upon a prisoner\u201d or \"create a cause of action for prisoners to challenge their detention under a facially valid judgment and sentence.\u201d <em>Edwards v. Crews, </em>124 So.3d 422, 424 (Fla. Dist.Ct.App.2013).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
