Pitts argues that his sentence is substantively unreasonable. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-19\">Pitts is barred from challenging the reasonableness of his sentence. Under the doctrine of invited error, when a defendant invites or induces the district court to impose a particular sentence, the defendant cannot complain about that sentence on appeal. <em>United States v. Braman, </em>562 F.3d 1300, 1306 (11th Cir.2009). After the district court revoked Pitts\u2019s supervised release and ordered him to serve 9 months of imprisonment and 24 months of supervised release, Pitts interjected that \u201cif [he was] going to go to prison, [he] might as well get it over with\u201d and he wanted to \u201cserve the 24 months straight.\u201d When questioned by the district court, Pitts confirmed that he wanted a sentence of 24 months of imprisonment. Pitts cannot contest the substantive reasonableness of a sentence that he requested. And even if the doctrine of invited error did not apply, we would affirm Pitts\u2019s sentence within the guideline range as substantively reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-20\">We AFFIRM Pitts\u2019s sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
