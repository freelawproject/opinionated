He argues that the sentence imposed by the district court was substantively unreasonable and greater than necessary. He further argues that the sentence constituted an abuse of discretion because it improperly double-counted previous convictions and unreasonably inflated his criminal history score.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-20\">Noting that the record reveals no objection to the sentence or to the alleged double-counting, Membreno concedes that the plain error standard of review applies. He is correct that his arguments are subject to plain error review. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 134-35, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009); <em>United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391-92 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-21\">The argument that his guidelines range was greater than necessary to meet 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s goals as a result of giving too much weight to or \u201cdouble counting\u201d his criminal history is unavailing. The Guidelines provide for consideration of a prior conviction for both criminal history and the U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 enhancement. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2L1.2, comment, (n.6). As Membre-no concedes, we have rejected the argument that such double-counting necessarily renders a sentence unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-22\">Membreno suggests that the district court should have considered as a mitigating element the fact that illegal reentry is essentially a non-violent offense and that an extended term of imprisonment is disproportionate to the relative seriousness of the offense. We have also rejected the argument that illegal reentry is treated too harshly under \u00a7 2L1.2. <em>See United States v. Aguirre-Villa, </em>460 F.3d 681, 683 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-23\">Membreno\u2019s arguments do not show a clear error of judgment on the district court\u2019s part in balancing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors; instead, they constitute a mere disagreement with the weighing of those factors. <em>See United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009). He has not dem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>onstrated that the district court plainly erred in the imposition of his sentence. <em>See Peltier, </em>505 F.3d at 391-92. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b244-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
