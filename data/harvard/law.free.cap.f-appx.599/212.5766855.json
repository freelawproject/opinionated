In claiming his sentence substantively unreasonable because it is greater than necessary to meet the sentencing goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), Chicas maintains his advisory Guidelines-sentencing range is too severe because the reentry Guideline is not based on empirical analysis, the Guidelines double-count his criminal history, and they fail to account for the \u201cinternational trespass\u201d nature of his reentry offense. He further claims the court failed to consider: his benign motive for returning; his strong ties to the United States; and his substance abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">Although <em>post-Booker, </em>the Sentencing Guidelines are advisory only, and a properly preserved objection to an ultimate sentence is reviewed for reasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard, the district court must still properly calculate the advisory Guidelines-sentencing range for use in deciding on the sentence to impose. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). In that respect, for issues preserved in district court, its application of the Guidelines is reviewed <em>de novo; </em>its factual findings, only for clear error. <em>E.g., United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008). Chicas does not claim procedural error. Instead, as noted, he claims only that his sentence is substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">Conceding he failed to object to the reasonableness of his sentence in district court, Chicas asserts plain-error review should not apply because no objection is required to preserve the issue of the substantive reasonableness of a sentence. He acknowledges, however, that this issue is foreclosed, and he raises it only to preserve it for further possible review. <em>E.g., United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391-92 (5th Cir.2007); <em>see also United States v. Broussard, </em>669 F.3d 537, 546 (5th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-9\">Under the plain-error standard, Chicas must show a forfeited plain (clear or obvious) error that affected his substantial rights. <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If he does so, we have the discretion to correct the error, but should do so only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the proceedings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b251-10\">As he concedes, Chicas\u2019 empirical-data contention is foreclosed. <em>E.g., United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 366-67 (5th Cir. 2009). This court has also rejected Chicas\u2019 international-trespass contention. <em>E.g., United States v. Aguirre-Villa, </em>460 F.3d 681, 683 (5th Cir.2006). (Again, he raises both claims only to preserve them for further possible review.)</p>\n<p id=\"b251-11\">Additionally, Chicas\u2019 within-Guidelines sentence is presumed reasonable. <em>E.g., United States v. Rashad, </em>687 F.3d 637, 644 (5th Cir.2012) (citation omitted). His general disagreement with the propriety of his sentence and the court\u2019s weighing of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors is insufficient to rebut that presumption. <em>E.g., United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009). Further, the court considered Chicas\u2019 claims in mitigation and rejected them. <em>E.g., United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b250-6\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
