Rivers, a <em>pro se </em>federal prisoner, appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his petition for writ of habeas corpus filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. On appeal, Rivers argues that the district court erred in dismissing his <em>Castillo v. United </em>States<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> claim, which establishes that his 30-year mandatory minimum sen-</p>\n<p id=\"b980-20\">tence constituted a \u201cfundamental defect\u201d because it was outside the sentencing range for the crime authorized by Congress. He also contends that his sentence is unlawful under <em>DePierre v. United </em>States<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> because his indictment did not contain the required elements of a 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(A)(ii) enhancement.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-21\">Whether a prisoner may bring a \u00a7 2241 petition under the savings clause of \u00a7 2255(e) is a question of law that we review <em>de novo. Bryant v. Warden, FCC Coleman-Medium, </em>738 F.3d 1253, 1262 (11th Cir.2013). The applicability of the savings clause is a threshold jurisdictional issue, and the savings clause imposes a subject-matter jurisdictional limit on \u00a7 2241 petitions. <em>Williams v. Warden, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, </em>713 F.3d 1332, 1337-38 (11th Cir.2013). Successive \u00a7 2241 petitions filed by federal prisoners are subject to threshold dismissal in the district court. <em>Antonelli v. Warden, U.S.P. Atlanta, </em>542 F.3d 1348, 1352 (11th Cir.2008). Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(a), a court need not entertain a request for habeas corpus relief \u201cif it appears that the legality of such detention has been determined by a judge or court of the United States on a prior application for a writ of habeas corpus, except as provided in section 2255.\u201d The power of a district court to grant a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 is limited by \u00a7 2255(e), which states,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b980-23\">An application for a writ of habeas corpus in behalf of a prisoner who is authorized to apply for relief by [a \u00a7 2255 motion], shall not be entertained if it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"943\">*943</page-number>appears that the applicant has failed to apply for relief, by motion, to the court which sentenced him, or that such court \u25a0 has denied him relief, unless it also appears that the remedy by motion is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b981-5\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e). \u201cAn application for a writ of habeas corpus\u201d includes a petition filed under \u00a7 2241. <em>Bryant, </em>738 F.3d at 1262.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-6\">When a prisoner previously has filed a \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate, he must apply for and receive permission from the court of appeals before filing a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2244(b), 2255(h). The restrictions on filing successive \u00a7 2255 motions do not render a \u00a7 2255 remedy \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d for purposes of the \u00a7 2255(e) savings clause. <em>Bryant, </em>738 F.3d at 1267. Rather, to show that a prior \u00a7 2255 motion was inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention, a petitioner asserting a sentencing-error claim must establish that: (1) binding circuit precedent squarely foreclosed the claim during the petitioner\u2019s sentencing, direct appeal, and first \u00a7 2255 proceeding; (2) after the petitioner\u2019s first \u00a7 2255 proceeding, a U.S. Supreme Court decision overturned that circuit precedent; (3) the rule announced in that Supreme Court decision applies retroactively on collateral review; and (4) as a result of that new rule, the petitioner\u2019s sentence exceeds the statutory maximum authorized by Congress. <em>See id. </em>at 1274.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-7\">Rivers\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition \u2014 his second \u2014 is an attempt to circumvent the restriction on successive \u00a7 2255 motions. The Court previously denied him leave to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 petition, and for that matter, denied his first \u00a7 2241 petition. <em>Rivers v. McKelvy, </em>236 Fed.Appx. 508, 509, 511 (11th Cir.2007). Rivers\u2019s <em>Castillo </em>argument fails for the same reason that it did on his last appeal: Even if the jury did not find that the firearm involved was a machine gun for purposes of the enhanced sentence, Rivers was convicted of . an existent offense. Further, Rivers\u2019s <em>Castillo </em>claim was addressed in a previous \u00a7 2241 proceeding, so it was subject to threshold dismissal in the district court. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(a). Rivers\u2019s <em>DePierre </em>claim fails because he points to no case that says <em>DePierre </em>is retroactive. Therefore, he has not met his burden under <em>Bryant </em>of showing that <em>DePierre </em>applies retroactively on collateral review. <em>See Bryant, </em>738 F.3d at 1274.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b980-17\">. 530 U.S. 120, 120 S.Ct. 2090, 147 L.Ed.2d 94 (2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b980-18\">. 564 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2225, 180 L.Ed.2d 114 (2011).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b980-24\">.As Rivers has offered no substantive argument regarding the court's denial of his motion for reconsideration, he abandons that issue on appeal. <em>Timson v.
