Lowe\u2019s Complaint alleges product liability and negligence claims. On simultaneously filed motions of Crown, the district court excluded the testimony of Lowe\u2019s causation and alternative-design expert, Robert Friedmann (\u201cFriedmann\u201d), and granted summary judgment in favor of Crown and against Lowe. We affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">I.Standards of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">We review for an abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s order regarding the admissibility of expert testimony under Rule 702. <em>General Elec. Co. v. Joiner, </em>522 U.S. 136, 141-43, 118 S.Ct. 512, 517, 139 L.Ed.2d 508 (1997); <em>Cook ex rel. Tessier v. Sheriff of Monroe Cnty., </em>402 F.3d 1092, 1103 (11th Cir.2005). We will not reverse a ruling on the admissibility of expert testimony unless the ruling is manifestly erroneous. <em>Id. </em>Because of the \u201cconsiderable leeway\u201d afforded the district court in determining admissibility, we will not overturn its decision even if \u201cwe would have gone the other way had it been our call.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This standard is not relaxed even if the decision we review is outcome-determinative. <em>Id. </em>at 1107 (citation omitted). We also review for an abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s decision to exclude expert testimony without conducting an evidentia-ry hearing. <em>Id. </em>at 1113-14 (citing <em>Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael, </em>526 U.S. 137, 152-53, 119 S.Ct. 1167, 1176, 143 L.Ed.2d 238). Finally, we review de novo a district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment. <em>Williams v. Mast Biosurgery USA, Inc., </em>644 F.3d 1312, 1318 (11th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-10\">II.Contentions of the Parties</p>\n<p id=\"b415-11\">Lowe contends: (1) that the district court abused its discretion by striking the entirety of Friedmann\u2019s testimony; (2) that the district court abused its discretion by striking this evidence without conducting an evidentiary hearing; and (3) that the district court improperly granted Crown summary judgment even without Friedmann\u2019s expert testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-12\">Crown contends that the district court did not abuse its discretion by excluding Friedmann\u2019s testimony without an eviden-tiary hearing, especially in light of Lowe\u2019s failure to request one. Crown contends that the district court properly granted summary judgment because Lowe, without Friedmann\u2019s testimony, could not produce evidence sufficient to create a genuine issue of fact as to causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-13\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b415-14\">We conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion by granting Crown\u2019s motion to exclude Friedmann\u2019s testimony without holding an evidentiary hearing that Lowe did not even request. We have carefully considered the court\u2019s order (Order, Doc. 66) granting both the motion to exclude and Crown\u2019s motion for summary judgment. We agree with the court\u2019s analysis and conclusions. Friend-mann\u2019s testimony was the only evidence of causation, an essential element of Lowe\u2019s claims, and, without this evidence, Crown was entitled to summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-15\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b415-16\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b415-8\">. We noted sua sponte deficient pleadings of diversity jurisdiction. We are satisfied from the parties\u2019 submissions that the district court had diversity jurisdiction.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
