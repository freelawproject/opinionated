Najera-Navarrete challenges the substantive reasonableness of his sentence, arguing that his sentence is unreasonable because it is greater than necessary to achieve the sentencing goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). We review sentences for substantive reasonableness, in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 49-51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). A within-guidelines sentence is entitled to a presumption of reasonableness. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 347, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). \u201cThe presumption is rebutted only upon a showing that the sentence does not account for a factor that should receive significant weight, it gives significant weight to an irrelevant or improper factor, or it represents a clear error of judgment in balancing sentencing factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir .2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-24\">Najera-Navarrete \u25a0 contends that U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 is not empirically based and not subject to the presumption of reasonableness. He acknowledges that this argument has been rejected by this court in <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357 (5th Cir.2009), but he seeks to preserve the argument for further review. He also argues that the presumption of reasonableness does not apply because \u00a7 2L1.2 effectively double counts a defendant\u2019s criminal history. This argument has been rejected in <em>United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir. 2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>In challenging the substantive reasonableness of his sentence, Najera-Navar-rete argues that the sentence did not account for his personal history, his benign motive in reentering the United States, his cultural assimilation to this country, and his family circumstances. The district court rejected these arguments at sentencing. Najera-Navarrete\u2019s disagreement with the district court\u2019s weighing of the \u00a7 3558(a) factors is insufficient to rebut the presumption of reasonableness that attaches to a within-guidelines sentence. <em>See Cooks, </em>589 F.3d at 186. Najera-Na-varrete has not demonstrated that the district court abused its discretion by sentencing him to a within-guidelines sentence of 46 months. <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b207-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
