We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">\u00b62 We review the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">\u00b63 Whether the District Court had subject matter jurisdiction to consider the State\u2019s June 2, 2006, petition for civil commitment?</p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">\u00b64 Whether the District Court\u2019s statements of facts in its May 5, 2006, and June 9, 2006, orders of commitment sufficiently supported its determination that GM was suffering from a mental disorder and required commitment?</p>\n<p id=\"b143-9\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b143-10\">\u00b65 The Billings police responded to a complaint that GM had been yelling out of his apartment window in the early morning horns of April 27, 2006. GM claimed that he had been irritated with the \u201ctrash men [who] come by there every morning about five in the morning and ... wake [him] up ....\u201d The police placed GM in custody and transported him to the Deaconess Psychiatric Center (Center) in light of the fact that he had been \u201cyelling and screaming out the window and being confused and acting bizarrely.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b143-11\">\u00b66 Admitting psychiatrist Dr. Robert McDermott (Dr. McDermott) examined GM and recommended on April 28, 2006, that the State file a petition for involuntary mental health commitment. The State filed a petition on May 1, 2006, asking the court to commit GM to a mental health facility for a period of no more than three months.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-12\">\u00b67 The court held a commitment hearing on May 5, 2006, where Dr. McDermott testified on behalf of the State, and GM testified on his own behalf. Dr. McDermott testified that GM had acted disordered, psychotic, and at one point had told Dr. McDermott that he would \u201ckick his ass\u201d if GM\u2019s attorney was not present. Dr. McDermott concluded that GM suffered from a mental disorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-13\">\u00b68 The court found that GM was \u201csuffering from a mental disorder and requires commitment.\u201d The court ordered that GM be placed in the custody of the officials at the Montana State Hospital at Warm Springs (State Hospital) for a period not to exceed three months. GM appealed the court\u2019s commitment order on May 8,2006. He discharged from the State Hospital later that month.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-14\">\u00b69 GM found himself back in the Center around June 1, 2006. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>circumstances that brought GM to the Center are unclear in the record. The record indicates only that GM arrived at the Center in an ambulance and was placed in the care of Diane Goedde (Nurse Goedde), a family nurse practitioner at the Center. Nurse Goedde recommended on June 1, 2006, that the State file a petition for involuntary mental health commitment. Her recommendation noted, among other things, that GM had been \u201cpsychotic, agitated, confused\u201d and had \u201cthreatened to hurt others,\u201d and that he had \u201cnumerous inpatient stays\u201d at the Center and the State Hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">\u00b610 The State filed a petition on June 2, 2006, asking the court to commit GM to a mental health facility for a period of no more than three months. GM filed a motion to dismiss the petition on the grounds that the State had filed its petition under the same cause number as the court\u2019s May 5, 2006, order of commitment. He argued that his appeal of the court\u2019s May 5, 2006, order of commitment had divested the court of subject matter jurisdiction over any matter filed under the same cause number.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">\u00b611 The court denied GM\u2019s motion to dismiss and held a hearing on June 9, 2006. Nurse Goedde and Yellowstone County Deputy Sheriff Chris Romero (Officer Romero) testified on behalf of the State, and GM testified on behalf of himself. Nurse Goedde testified that GM was a threat to others and himself and that he was unable to care for himself due to his present mental state. Officer Romero testified that he had heard GM claim that he had not been getting his pain medication and that the pain was making him want to kill himself. The court found that the State had established beyond a reasonable medical certainty that GM was suffering from a mental disorder that required his commitment. The court ordered that GM be placed in the custody of the officials at the State Hospital for a period not to exceed three months. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">\u00b612 We review a trial court's findings of fact in an involuntary commitment case to determine whether, upon viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prevailing party, the findings are clearly erroneous. <em>In Re A.K., </em>2006 MT 166, \u00b6 9, 332 Mont. 511, \u00b6 9, 139 P.3d 849, \u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b144-9\">\u00b613 <em>Whether the District Court had subject matter jurisdiction to consider the State\u2019s June 2, 2006, petition for civil commitment?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b145-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>\u00b614 GM argues first that the District Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the State\u2019s June 2,2006, petition for civil commitment in light of the fact that it was filed under the same cause number as GM\u2019s May 5, 2006, commitment order pursuant to the Uniform Caseload Filing Standards (January 1, 2006) (available at http://www.cmmts.mt.gov/orders/dcstandards.pdf). He points to <em>McCormick v. McCormick, </em>168 Mont. 136, 138, 541 P.2d 765, 766 (1975), for the proposition that an appeal \u201cto this Court stays all proceedings in the district court, thereby removing jurisdiction from that court to proceed further in the matter.\u201d GM suggests that the Uniform Caseload Filing Standards \u201cmay have created a new class of \u2018all proceedings\u2019\u201d encompassing all petitions for civil commitment filed under the same cause number. GM argues that his appeal of the May 5, 2006, order of commitment divested the District Court of subject matter jurisdiction over the State\u2019s June 2, 2006, petition in light of the fact that both documents had been filed under the same cause number.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">\u00b615  GM fails to note, however, that the Uniform Caseload Filing Standards \u201care intended <em>solely </em>for purposes of record-keeping within the office of the Clerk of Court.\u201d (Emphasis in original). Montana Uniform Caseload Filing Standards at 1. Nothing in these procedures suggests that a respondent\u2019s pending appeal of a single commitment order divests a district court of subject matter jurisdiction over any subsequent petitions filed under the same cause number.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">\u00b616  GM also fails to notice the next line in <em>McCormick, </em>168 Mont. at 138, 541 P.2d at 766, where this Court states that \u201c \u2018[i]t is familiar law that an appeal to this [C]ourt divests the district court of jurisdiction over the <em>order or judgment </em>from which the appeal is taken.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added). GM appealed only from the court\u2019s May 5, 2006, order of commitment, thus, his appeal divested the district court of jurisdiction only over the May 5, 2006, order.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">\u00b617 <em>Whether the District Court\u2019s statements of facts in its May 5,2006, and June 9, 2006, orders of commitment sufficiently supported its determination that GM was suffering from a mental disorder and required commitment?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">\u00b618 GM argues next that the court failed to provide \u201ca detailed statement of the facts\u201d to support its orders for commitment. The District Court\u2019s \u201cStatement of Facts\u201d supporting its May 5,2006, order of commitment provides in its entirety as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-8\">1. The petition initiating this proceeding was filed May 1,2006, and the Respondent was duly served a copy of the petition for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>commitment, and was fully advised of his rights and the substantive effects of the petition by his court-appointed attorney.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-4\">2. Respondent voluntarily waived the initial appearance and hearing in this matter; the waiver of hearing, signed by Respondent, after being properly advised of his rights by his court-appointed attorney, is part of the court record and is hereby incorporated by reference.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-5\">3. On May 5, 2006, Respondent appeared in Court with Terry L. Seiffert, his court appointed attorney, for the evidentiary hearing. Based on testimony given and the recommendation of his treating physician, Dr. Robert McDermott, it was determined that Respondent would best be treated by placement in the Montana State Hospital.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-7\">4. Respondent is beyond a reasonable medical certainty suffering from a mental disorder as defined in Section 53-21-102, M. C.A.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b146-9\">This statement of facts is almost identical to the court\u2019s statement of facts supporting its June 9, 2006, order of commitment, except for the names of the witnesses and collateral procedural matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-10\">\u00b619 The trial comb\u2019s order of commitment must contain \u201ca detailed statement of the facts upon which the court found the respondent to be suffering from a mental disorder and requiring commitment.\u201d Section 53-21-127(8)(a), MCA; <em>In Re A.K., </em>\u00b6 12. We have held, in fact, that \u201c[t]he statutes governing involuntary commitment are critically important due to the \u2018calamitous effect of a commitment....\u2019 \u201d <em>In Re A.K., </em>\u00b6 11. We also have \u201cstrongly cautioned trial courts to strictly comply with all relevant statutes.\u201d <em>In Re A.K., </em>\u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-11\">\u00b620 The State admits that the court failed to provide \u201cdetailed statement[s] of facts ....\u201d supporting its May 5,2006, and June 9,2006, orders of commitment. The State points to our holding in <em>Matter of R.J.W., </em>226 Mont. 419, 424, 736 P.2d 110, 113 (1987), however, as support for its proposition that there is \u201csufficient detail in the record as a whole to affirm the District Court.\u201d This Court held in <em>R.J.</em>W. that the trial court\u2019s lack of detailed findings supporting its order of commitment were \u201charmless\u201d to R.J.W. \u201c[g]iven the detail in the record as a whole.\u201d <em>R.J.W., </em>226 Mont. at 424, 736 P.2d at 113.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-12\">\u00b621 The State argues that the court\u2019s lack of detailed findings here similarly are harmless to GM in light of sufficient factual detail in the record, including the testimony of Dr. McDermott in the May 5, 2006, hearing and the testimony of Nurse Goedde in the June 9, 2006, hearing. The State fails to note, however, that this Court emphasized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number><em>in R.J.W. </em>that \u201c[f]uture findings of fact should more carefully detail the factual basis on which a finding of serious mental illness is premised.\u201d <em>R.J.W., </em>226 Mont. at 424, 736 P.2d at 113.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">\u00b622  The District Court\u2019s findings failed to detail the factual basis of its determination that GM suffered from a mental disorder and required commitment. Section 53-21-127(8)(a), MCA, directs the court to provide a \u201cdetailed statement of the facts upon which the court found the respondent to be suffering from a mental disorder and requiring commitment.\u201d The court\u2019s conclusory restatement of the statutory criteria and its vague reference to witness testimony do not constitute strict compliance with the statutory mandate. The District Court has failed to provide a detailed statement of facts to support its findings that GM was suffering from a mental disorder and that he required commitment. We conclude that the District Court\u2019s findings are clearly erroneous in light of these deficiencies. <em>In Re </em>A.K., \u00b6 32.</p>\n<p id=\"AbO\">\u00b623 We reverse the District Court\u2019s May 5, 2006, and June 9, 2006, orders of commitment and direct the District Court to vacate the orders of commitment.</p>\n<judges id=\"b147-5\">JUSTICES LEAPHART, COTTER, WARNER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
