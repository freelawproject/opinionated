Bonamarte (Bonamarte) appeals from an order of protection issued by the Eighteenth Judicial District, Gallatin County. We remand to the District Court for the entry of the court\u2019s findings of facts and conclusions of law pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 52(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">FACTUAL AND PRODECURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">\u00b62 Bonamarte and Jan Edelen (Edelen) began dating in 2003. The relationship soured and Edelen petitioned Gallatin County Justice Court on March 24, 2006, for a temporary order of protection against Bonamarte. Edelen claimed that Bonamarte refused to stop contacting her following the breakup of their relationship and threatened her and her children in subsequent telephone conversations.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">\u00b63 The Justice Court granted the temporary order of protection and held a hearing on April 12,2006, to determine whether to continue the order of protection. The court found that Edelen was \u201cin danger of harm\u201d and that good cause existed to continue the order of protection against Bonamarte.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">\u00b64 Bonamarte appealed to the District Court. The court held a hearing <em>de novo </em>on June 5, 2006. Edelen presented her two sons as witnesses. They testified that Bonamarte threatened them on numerous occasions. Edelen also testified that Bonamarte threatened her \u201cmany, many times\u201d and refused to leave her alone. Bonamarte testified that he was \u201ca terrible boyfriend, partner\u201d to Edelen but that he never threatened her or her sons.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-9\">\u00b65 The court determined, based on the testimony, that Bonamarte had caused Edelen \u201csubstantial emotional distress, if not reasonable apprehension of bodily injury by repeatedly harassing, threatening, and intimidating her.\u201d The court\u2019s order cites to \u00a7 40-15-102(2)(a), MCA. This statute allows a victim of stalking, as defined in \u00a7 45-5-220, MCA, to petition for an order of protection against an offender. The court\u2019s order quotes the definition of stalking as provided in \u00a7 45-5-220, MCA. The court also recites portions of Edelen\u2019s testimony that Bonamarte threatened and intimidated her, causing her to be afraid for herself and for her children. The court\u2019s order further notes Edelen\u2019s testimony that Bonamarte caused her fear by mailing a receipt to her and by visiting the gym on two occasions during the afternoon when he knew that she would be there. The court continued the order of protection issued by the Justice Court for a period of one year. Bonamarte appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\">\u00b66 We refuse to overturn the district court\u2019s decision to continue, amend, or make permanent an order of protection absent an abuse of the court\u2019s discretion. <em>Bock v. Smith, </em>2005 MT 40, \u00b6 29, 326 Mont. 123, \u00b6 29, 107 P.3d 488, \u00b6 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">\n<em>\u00b67 Whether the district court abused its discretion when it continued the order of protection against Bonamarte.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">\u00b68 Bonamarte argues that insufficient evidence supports the court\u2019s order of protection based on the provisions of \u00a7 40-15-102(2)(a), MCA. This statute allows a victim of stalking, as defined in \u00a7 45-5-220, MCA, to petition for an order of protection against an offender. Section 45-5-220, MCA, defines stalking as repeated harassment, threatening or intimidation of the stalked person. Bonamarte maintains that the receipt he sent to Edelen in the mail and the fact that he twice saw Edelen in a public place does not support the court\u2019s conclusion that Bonamarte repeatedly had engaged in the behaviors that constitute stalking. Bonamarte also contends that the pleadings never alleged that Bonamarte had stalked Edelen, and, thus, the district court abused its discretion in continuing an order of protection based on the stalking statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">\u00b69 The District Court possesses the authority to continue an order of protection under the stalking statute if Edelen presented \u201ccredible evidence\u201d that Bonamarte stalked her as defined in \u00a7 45-5-220(1), MCA. Sections 40-15-102(2)(a), 45-5-220(4), MCA. The court presumably determined that Edelen had presented such \u201ccredible evidence\u201d otherwise it would not have issued the amended order of protection against Bonamarte. We cannot know for certain the basis of the court's order, however, as the court failed to enter findings of facts and conclusions of law supporting its decision that good cause existed to continue the order of protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-9\">\u00b610 M. R. Civ. P. 52(a) requires the court to \u201cfind the facts specially and state separately its conclusions of law\u201d in all actions tried upon the facts without a jury. Requiring findings of fact under M. R. Civ. P. 52(a) serves to aid the trial judge\u2019s process of adjudication, to assist in the determination of <em>res judicata </em>and estoppel by judgment, and to help the appellate court on review. <em>Snavely v. St. John, </em>2006 MT 175, \u00b6 16, 333 Mont. 16, \u00b6 16, 140 P.3d 492, \u00b6 16. The court\u2019s failure to state the findings of fact and conclusions of law in the recommended form does not constitute substantial error if the court\u2019s findings and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>conclusions are clear to this Court. We consider \u201cwhether a district court\u2019s order sets forth reasoning, based upon its findings of fact and conclusions of law, in a manner sufficient to allow informed appellate review.\u201d <em>Snavely, </em>\u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">\u00b611 The District Court\u2019s order fails to set forth the court\u2019s support for its finding that Bonamarte caused Edelen \u201csubstantial emotional distress, if not reasonable apprehension of bodily injury, by repeatedly harassing, threatening, and intimidating her.\u201d The court\u2019s order simply refers to \u00a7 45-5-220, MCA, the stalking statute, and recites Edelen\u2019s testimony that she felt threatened by Bonamarte. Simply reciting the contentions of the parties and reaching a legal conclusion does not satisfy the court\u2019s duty to make factual findings and conclusions of law under M. R. Civ. P. 52(a). \u201cThe court must also make factual findings and combine those with a logical, reasoned analysis and application of the law to the facts.\u201d <em>Snavely, </em>\u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">\u00b612  The court\u2019s failure to enter findings of fact and conclusions of law, as required by M. R. Civ. P. 52(a), precludes this Court from undertaking appellate review. We refuse to review the record with the purpose of making our own factual findings. <em>Snavely, </em>\u00b6 19. This Court\u2019s function includes determining whether the district court abused its discretion in continuing the order of protection against Bonamarte. <em>Bock, </em>\u00b6 29. We cannot carry out this task without a complete order from the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">\u00b613  We remand to the District Court for entry of findings of fact and conclusions of law as required by M. R. Civ. P. 52(a). The court\u2019s order of June 14,2006, continuing the order of protection, shall remain in full force and effect during the pendency of the remand to the District Court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b436-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES COTTER, NELSON and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
