We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-14\">\u00b62 The issue on appeal is whether the District Court erred in denying Hartinger\u2019s postconviction claims alleging his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance of counsel by:</p>\n<p id=\"b459-15\">\u00b63 a. failing to file a notice of appeal?</p>\n<p id=\"b459-16\">\u00b64 b. failing to file a motion to suppress Hartinger\u2019s incriminating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>statements?</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">\u00b65 c. failing to file a motion to suppress \u201cnewly discovered\u201d evidence?</p>\n<p id=\"A4i\">\u00b66 d. the manner in which counsel conducted voir dire?</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">\u00b67 On February 1, 2003, at approximately 3:15 a.m., Officer Claus James Meier (Officer Meier) of the Ravalli County Sheriffs Office (RCSO) observed Hartinger driving his vehicle on the wrong side of Highway 93 between Missoula and Hamilton, proceeding north to Missoula. Officer Meier activated his patrol car\u2019s flashing lights and siren in an attempt to stop Hartinger, but Hartinger initially failed to pull over, continuing to drive for approximately one mile and passing many convenient places to stop. Hartinger finally pulled over, but before Officer Meier could get out of his car, Hartinger sped off again. Officer Meier pursued Hartinger and radioed dispatch that a failure to yield incident was in progress. Road conditions were poor from continuing heavy rain, with water standing on the road, and Officer Meier observed that Hartinger had difficulty controlling his vehicle. Hartinger eventually lost control, crossed the highway into the oncoming lane of traffic, and fishtailed along the shoulder of the southbound lane before again regaining control of the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">\u00b68 Hartinger then made a left-hand turn onto a highway access road that led to Meridian Road, which runs parallel to Highway 93. Hartinger made the turn immediately in front of a southbound vehicle, forcing the driver to slam on its brakes to avoid colliding with Hartinger, and, in doing so, causing the car to slide out of control into the ditch. After ensuring the passengers of that car were fine, Officer Meier continued his pursuit of Hartinger, who by then had left the paved road and was speeding along a rural, muddy road. Office Meier noted that, despite going 70 miles per hour in his patrol car at times, Hartinger was pulling away from him. The pursuit continued through the town of Victor, where Officer Meier observed Hartinger race through several intersections without stopping at stop signs or even checking for traffic.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">\u00b69 RCSO Deputy McElderry and Sergeant Fowler joined the pursuit of Hartinger. Hartinger headed west into the mountains up a narrow, unpaved forest service road in poor winter condition, forcing an approaching vehicle to pull off the road to avoid a collision. A short time later, Hartinger\u2019s vehicle slid off the road, whereupon he fled on foot into the woods, with Officer Meier in chase. Officer Meier yelled \u201cSheriffs Office, stop!\u201d but Hartinger ignored this directive. Hartinger <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>was eventually caught by Officer Meier with Deputy McElderry assisting. Walking Hartinger back to the cars, Officer Meier noted a strong smell of alcohol emanating from Hartinger and noticed that he had difficulty maintaining his balance.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">\u00b610 Officer Meier, Deputy McElderry, and Hartinger were part of the way back to the car when Sergeant Fowler caught up. Upon meeting them, and before Hartinger was <em>Mirandized, </em>Sergeant Fowler asked him \u201c[w]hat he thought he was doing,\u201d and Hartinger responded, \u201cI\u2019m drunk and I\u2019m trying to get away.\u201d Reaching Hartinger\u2019s car, the officers observed, in plain view, a marijuana pipe containing a green leafy substance on the floorboard, along with several opened and unopened containers of beer.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">\u00b611 Sergeant Fowler placed Hartinger into his patrol car and transported him to the Ravalli County Detention Center (RCDC). During transport, Hartinger volunteered an apology for anyone who had been hurt during the chase and again stated that he was just drunk and wanted to get away. Upon arrival at RCDC, Hartinger was processed and booked. A standard field sobriety test was administered, but he refused to take the one-legged stand test or provide a breath sample.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">\u00b612 Hartinger was charged with criminal endangerment, driving under the influence of alcohol and/or drugs (second offense), reckless driving while eluding, criminal possession of dangerous drugs, criminal possession of drug paraphernalia, and open container.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Hartinger\u2019s initial appearance was held on February 20, 2003, with public defender Kathy Anderson representing him. Mark McLaverty replaced Ms. Anderson as counsel upon her relocation to Billings. On July 8, 2003, at Hartinger\u2019s pretrial conference, Hartinger requested that the court appoint Mr. McLaverty\u2019s associate, Michael Montgomery (Montgomery), to represent him, with McLaverty as \u201cstandby\u201d counsel, because Hartinger had seen press reporting about Montgomery\u2019s recent trial success and had also observed him while he visited other clients in RCDC. The District Court granted this request, appointing Montgomery as co-counsel, with Hartinger being directed to contact Montgomery, as Montgomery was not present at the pretrial conference.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">\u00b613 Upon learning of his appointment, Montgomery reviewed the matter and visited Hartinger at the RCDC. He offered his assessment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>that the facts of the case did not look good, discussed the law, and reviewed trial strategy. Montgomery advised Hartinger to accept a plea bargain offered by the State, but Hartinger refused and subsequently asked about the statements he had made to police. Montgomery testified at the postconviction hearing that, in answering Hartinger\u2019s question, he said \u201cwe probably should\u2019ve suppressed that or tried to suppress that. You can always claim ineffective against me,\u201d explaining he had said that to instill confidence in Hartinger that Montgomery was \u201chere to advocate for [him].\u201d However, Montgomery also testified that the statement was a \u201cflip comment\u201d and that, in light of Hartinger\u2019s refusal of the plea bargain and his appointment three weeks before trial, with the motion deadline already passed, he had proceeded to develop a trial theory which incorporated the statements. Further, he noted that, in his opinion, the motion would not have been \u201clegally relevant in the light that [Hartinger] was <em>Mirandized </em>later and in custody and he made a statement, \u00b6 was drunk.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">\u00b614 On Monday, August 11, 2003, the day trial was scheduled to commence, the parties held a pretrial conference in chambers to discuss the 911 audiotape and transcript, which had been made of law enforcement\u2019s pursuit of Hartinger. The State had provided this evidence the previous Friday, and based on the \u201cnewly discovered\u201d evidence, Montgomery moved to dismiss the charges. He did not file a motion to suppress the evidence. The State responded that the audiotape and transcript were just different forms of the dispatch log earlier provided to the defense, and were not newly discovered evidence. The court denied the motion to dismiss, but granted a one-day continuance of the trial to allow the defense to prepare for the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">\u00b615 Montgomery\u2019s approach in voir dire was to speak positively about law enforcement in order to elicit countervailing, negative comments about law enforcement from prospective jurors. Based on his assessment of the jury pool, Montgomery thought it was more beneficial to entice prospective jurors to acknowledge that police officers made mistakes, than for Montgomery, himself, to personally attack them. As a result, Montgomery elected not to challenge for cause prospective jurors Snodgrass and Cleveland, despite their \u201cpro-police\u201d views and instead used a peremptory challenge to exclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>Snodgrass.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">\u00b616 At the conclusion of the State\u2019s case-in-chief, Montgomery moved for a directed verdict on the charges of criminal possession of dangerous drugs and criminal endangerment. The court granted the motion on the criminal possession charge, but denied the motion with regard to criminal endangerment, finding sufficient evidence to establish a prima facie case against Hartinger. In his case-in-chief, Hartinger offered evidence that police had overestimated his speed through two expert witnesses who used mathematical calculations to demonstrate that Hartinger was not driving 70 miles per hour, but was actually driving closer to an average speed of approximately 45 miles per hour. Then, during settlement of jury instructions, Montgomery argued that this evidence supported an instruction for negligent endangerment in addition to criminal endangerment. The District Court denied the request, reasoning that there was no evidence Hartinger negligently, rather than purposely, engaged in the conduct of fleeing from police. The jury subsequently found Hartinger guilty of criminal endangerment, driving under the influence of alcohol and/or drugs, criminal possession of drug paraphernalia, and possessing an open container within his vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">\u00b617 After the trial, Montgomery visited Hartinger in the RCDC, at which time Hartinger advised Montgomery that he was going to file a complaint against Montgomery for his failure to file a motion to suppress Hartinger\u2019s statements to law enforcement. Montgomery responded by telling Hartinger that he would not file Hartinger\u2019s notice of appeal, since the complaint would create a conflict of interest. Hartinger filed the complaint against Montgomery with the Office of Disciplinary Counsel, and Montgomery subsequently admitted that he had neither properly withdrawn as Hartinger\u2019s counsel of record nor perfected Hartinger\u2019s appeal. As a result, Montgomery was disciplined by the Montana Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">\u00b618 On July 22, 2004, the District Court conducted a hearing on Hartinger\u2019s request for appointment of new counsel, and the court then granted Montgomery\u2019s motion to withdraw as counsel. Scott Albers (Albers) was thereafter appointed as counsel of record for Hartinger. However, after discussing the issue with Albers, Hartinger did not file a motion for an out-of-time appeal. Instead, on October 4, 2004, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>Hartinger filed a petition for postconviction relief alleging ineffective assistance of counsel. Following the filing of Hartinger\u2019s petition for postconviction relief, the District Court conducted an evidentiary hearing, wherein Montgomery appeared and testified concerning his representation of Hartinger. The court denied Hartinger\u2019s petition on July 12, 2005. Hartinger appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">\u00b619 This Court reviews a district court\u2019s denial of a postconviction relief petition to determine whether the district court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous and whether its conclusions of law are correct. <em>State v. Turner, </em>2000 MT 270, \u00b6 47, 302 Mont. 69, \u00b6 47, 12 P.3d 934, \u00b6 47. \u201cClaims of ineffective assistance of counsel, however, are mixed questions of law and fact.\u201d <em>Turner, </em>\u00b6 47 (citing <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 698, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 2070 (1984)) (\u201cboth the performance and prejudice components of the ineffectiveness inquiry are mixed questions of law and fact\u201d). Therefore, our review is <em>de novo. Turner, </em>\u00b6 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">\u00b620 The right to counsel in criminal prosecutions is guaranteed by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the Sixth Amendment, and Article II, Section 24, of the Montana Constitution. <em>Sellner v. State, </em>2004 MT 205, \u00b6 18, 322 Mont. 310, \u00b6 18, 95 P.3d 708, \u00b6 18. However, \u201c[i]neffective counsel may impinge the fundamental fairness of the proceeding being challenged.\u201d <em>Sellner, </em>\u00b6 18 (citing <em>State v. Henderson, </em>2004 MT 173, \u00b6 4, 322 Mont. 69, \u00b6 4, 93 P.3d 1231, \u00b6 4). For ineffectiveness claims, we have adopted the two-pronged test articulated by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Strickland:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-8\">First, the defendant must show that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient. This requires showing that counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the \u201ccounsel\u201d guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment. Second, the defendant must show that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense. This requires showing that counsel\u2019s errors were so serious as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial, a trial whose result is reliable. Unless a defendant makes both showings, it cannot be said that the conviction or death sentence resulted from a breakdown in the adversary process that renders the result unreliable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b464-9\"><em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687, 104 S. Ct. at 2064. If a defendant satisfies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>the first prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test and shows deficient performance by counsel, the defendant next must prove that counsel\u2019s deficient performance prejudiced his defense. <em>State v. Grixti, </em>2005 MT 296, \u00b6 26, 329 Mont. 330, \u00b6 26, 124 P.3d 177, \u00b6 26 (citing <em>State v. Lucero, </em>2004 MT 248, \u00b6 15, 323 Mont. 42, \u00b6 15, 97 P.3d 1106, \u00b6 15). \u201cdefendant must show that a reasonable probability exists that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Grixti, </em>\u00b6 26 (citing <em>Lucero, </em>\u00b6 15). As <em>Strickland </em>noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-4\">An error by counsel, even if professionally unreasonable, does not warrant setting aside the judgment of a criminal proceeding if the error had no effect on the judgment. [Citation omitted.] The purpose of the Sixth Amendment guarantee of counsel is to ensure that a defendant has the assistance necessary to justify reliance on the outcome of the proceeding. Accordingly, any deficiencies in counsel\u2019s performance must be prejudicial to the defense in order to constitute ineffective assistance under the Constitution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b465-5\"><em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 691-92, 104 S. Ct. at 2066-67.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">\u00b621  In order to constitute ineffective assistance, acts of counsel must stem from neglect or ignorance rather than from informed, professional deliberation. <em>State v. Gonzales, </em>278 Mont. 525, 532, 926 P.2d 705, 710 (1996). \u201c \u2018[T]he fact that some other lawyer... would have done differently ... is not ground for branding the appointed attorney with the opprobrium of ineffectiveness ....\u2019 \u201d <em>Grixti, </em>\u00b6 28 (quoting <em>Turner, </em>\u00b6 64) (citation omitted). As such, we must make every effort to eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight by employing \u201ccounsel\u2019s perspective at the time of trial to determine whether the conduct was reasonable.\u201d <em>Grixti, </em>\u00b6 25 (citing <em>Turner, </em>\u00b6 64).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">\u00b622 a. <em>Did the District Court err in denying Hartinger\u2019s postconviction claim that his attorney rendered ineffective assistance by failing to file a notice of appeal?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">\u00b623 Hartinger contends that Montgomery rendered ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to file a notice of appeal. Citing <em>State v. Tweed, </em>2002 MT 286, 312 Mont. 482, 59 P.3d 1105, Hartinger argues that failure to file a notice of appeal when the defendant clearly intends to pursue an appeal is per se prejudicial error warranting an automatic finding of ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-9\">\u00b624 The State counters that while it is undisputed that Montgomery failed to file a notice of appeal when he reasonably knew Hartinger desired to appeal, it is also undisputed that Hartinger knew he could seek an out-of-time appeal from this Court, was represented by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>counsel, and consciously chose not to pursue such an appeal. The State argues the District Court\u2019s conclusion that Hartinger waived his right to appeal is supported by substantial credible evidence, and, in any event, Hartinger was not prejudiced by the failure to file an appeal because Hartinger\u2019s claims were non-record based which needed to be raised in a postconviction proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">\u00b625 \u201cAn out-of-time appeal is a remedy that may be available to a criminal defendant who, through no fault of his own, misses a deadline for filing an appeal.\u201d <em>Tweed, </em>\u00b6 14 (citing <em>State v. Garner, </em>1999 MT 295, \u00b6 10, 297 Mont. 89, \u00b6 10, 990 P.2d 175, \u00b6 10). <em>Tweed </em>provides a procedure to pursue a remedial out-of-time appeal when a defendant\u2019s right to appeal is not properly preserved:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-5\">[S]uch a motion is an original proceeding before this Court and the provisions of Rule 17, M.R.App.P., apply. In order to obtain an out-of-time appeal, the <em>pro se </em>defendant or defendant\u2019s counsel shall file a motion with this Court. ... Upon a showing that the failure to notice a criminal appeal in a timely manner was \u201cexcusable under the circumstances,\u201d pursuant to Rule 21(b), M.R.App.P., this Court may conclude that an out-of-time appeal is the appropriate remedy. In such an event, we will order the matter remanded to the district court with an instruction to vacate and re-enter judgment to afford the defendant a second opportunity to act within the statutory time frames for filing notice of appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b466-6\"><em>Tweed, </em>\u00b6 15. Thus, a defendant must file the motion and record with this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">\u00b626 At the postconviction hearing, Hartinger testified that he was advised that an out-of-time appeal would be available to him as a result of Montgomery\u2019s failure to file a notice of appeal, that he understood what an out-of-time appeal was, and that he had discussed it with his postconviction counsel. However, Hartinger nonetheless made a conscious decision not to file a motion for an out-of-time appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">\u00b627  We conclude that substantial credible evidence supports the District Court\u2019s determination that Hartinger understood his right to file an out-of-time appeal, but that he knowingly and intentionally waived that right and instead chose to file a petition for postconviction relief. As a result of Hartinger\u2019s subsequent waiver of his right, Hartinger can claim no prejudice from Montgomery\u2019s failure to timely file the appeal, and we therefore affirm the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-9\">\u00b628 b. <em>Did the District Court err in denying Hartinger\u2019s </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number><em>postconviction claim that his attorney rendered ineffective assistance by failing to file a motion to suppress Hartinger\u2019s incriminating statements?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\">\u00b629 Hartinger argues that Montgomery was ineffective by failing to file a motion to suppress the <em>non-Mirandized </em>statements he made to the officers. He argues that he would have been entitled to a jury instruction regarding negligent, in addition to criminal, endangerment, had his statements admitting the crime been suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">\u00b630 The District Court found that, even if the first statement had been suppressed,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Montgomery believed the second statement would nonetheless have been allowed into evidence and therefore, given Hartinger\u2019s rejection of the plea bargain Montgomery had recommended, Montgomery planned to use the statements and the officers\u2019 failure to <em>Mirandize </em>Hartinger as part of his trial strategy to \u201cgive a voice\u201d to Hartinger\u2019s theory that he had safely regulated his speeds and that police were over-zealous and mistake-prone. Thus, the District Court concluded that Montgomery had \u201cmade an informed, strategic choice regarding Hartinger\u2019s statements . . . .\u201d Then, assuming for the sake of argument that Hartinger\u2019s statements should have been suppressed, the District Court farther concluded that the outcome would not have been affected, and thus Hartinger was not prejudiced:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-6\">Even if Hartinger\u2019s admissions were non-existent-whether they had never been uttered or were successfully suppressed, there is more than sufficient evidence to support his conviction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-7\">Precisely because this evidence was uncontrovertable, no reasonable trial strategy could have overcome it. There is no reasonable probability that Hartinger\u2019s statements created any prejudice to his defense that he \u201csafely regulated\u201d his speeds while he fled from the police.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">\u00b631 The \u201c[c]laimed inadequacy of counsel must not be tested by a greater sophistication of appellate counsel, nor by that counsel\u2019s unrivaled opportunity to study the record at leisure and cite different tactics of perhaps doubtful efficacy. Success is not the test of efficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>counsel, frequently neither vigor, zeal, nor skill can overcome the truth.\u201d <em>State v. Martz, </em>233 Mont. 136, 140, 760 P.2d 65, 68 (1988) (citations omitted). The District Court found credible Montgomery\u2019s testimony that he did not file a suppression motion because the motions deadline had passed before his appointment, he did not believe the two statements were made within a custodial interrogation, particularly the second one, which Montgomery believed was a voluntary statement initiated by Hartinger, and he planned to use the officers\u2019 failure to <em>Mirandize </em>Hartinger as part of his trial strategy that police officers made mistakes. Given the circumstances he faced in representing Hartinger, we cannot disagree with the District Court\u2019s conclusion that Montgomery made an informed, strategic choice regarding Hartinger\u2019s statements and that it was a reasonable course.</p>\n<p id=\"AqA\">\u00b632  We note that the factual differences between Hartinger\u2019s first admission, made in response to a question from an officer, and the second admission, offered voluntarily to officers, may have required, in response to a motion to suppress, different analyses and different outcomes. However, even if the statements should have been suppressed, we agree with the District Court that no prejudice accrued. There was more than sufficient evidence to support Hartinger\u2019s conviction of criminal endangerment even without these statements. The record shows that the jury was presented evidence of Hartinger knowingly driving on the wrong side of Highway 93, continuing to drive after Officer Meier activated his lights and siren, speeding away from police after initially pulling over, forcing two drivers off the road in separate incidents, leading police on a chase up the mountains, careening out of control and sliding his car over an embankment, and then fleeing, on foot, in disregard to police instructions. The District Court\u2019s rejection of Hartinger\u2019s proposed instruction on negligent endangerment was not occasioned by failing to have his statements suppressed; it was foreclosed by the absence of any evidence which would support his claim that he was acting only negligently. All the evidence pointed to purposeful actions. We therefore conclude there was \u201cno reasonable probability that the results of the proceedings would have been different but for\u201d Montgomery\u2019s claimed ineffectiveness. <em>State v. Diaz, </em>2006 MT 303, \u00b6 25, 334 Mont. 479, \u00b6 25, 148 P.3d 628, \u00b6 25 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">\u00b633 c. <em>Did the District Court err in denying Hartinger\u2019s postconviction claim that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to file a motion to suppress \u201cnewly discovered\u201d evidenced</em></p>\n<p id=\"b469-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>\u00b634 On the Friday before trial, the State turned over to the defense the 911 audiotape of the radio transmissions made during the pursuit of Hartinger and the corresponding transcript. Montgomery moved to dismiss the case based on the provision of late-provided discovery, which he described as \u201cnewly discovered.\u201d The District Court denied the motion to dismiss, but granted a one-day continuance of the trial to give the defense additional preparation time.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\">\u00b635 Hartinger alleged that Montgomery\u2019s failure to seek suppression of the \u201cnewly-discovered\u201d evidence, in addition to dismissal of the case, was ineffective assistance. At the postconviction hearing, the District Court found the audiotape and transcript were not \u201cnewly discovered\u201d evidence, but were simply different forms of the 911 dispatch log earlier provided to the defense. Moreover, the court concluded that Montgomery\u2019s performance was not deficient in this regard, but that he had made an informed, strategic choice to utilize the evidence, which he believed confirmed the defense\u2019s timeline theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">\u00b636  Montgomery\u2019s testimony, during the postconviction hearing, illustrated that his decision not to file a motion to suppress the 911 audiotape and transcript was made only after he determined this evidence contained information favorable to Hartinger\u2019s defense. Montgomery believed the audiotape confirmed that, consistent with his expert testimony, Hartinger\u2019s rate of speed was not the 70 miles per hour as the officers reported. Montgomery thus decided to utilize the continuance granted by the court to review the 911 audiotape with the defense witnesses and to incorporate it into their testimony. Thus, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the District Court\u2019s conclusion that Montgomery\u2019s decision not to seek suppression of this evidence was an informed, tactical decision, which did not constitute deficient performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">\u00b637 d. <em>Did the District Court err in denying Hartinger\u2019s postconviction claim that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by the manner in which he conducted voir dire?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">\u00b638 Hartinger argues that Montgomery\u2019s voir dire performance was deficient because he failed to challenge prospective juror Snodgrass for cause, and thereafter was forced to utilize a peremptory challenge to remove Snodgrass from the jury. He points to Snodgrass\u2019s responses to questioning from the State\u2019s attorney, wherein he stated that \u201cI\u2019ve had 11 years\u2019 law enforcement experience, and I don\u2019t think I could become impartial as far as this case is concerned. ... My views would be pro towards law enforcement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">\u00b639 Hartinger also maintains that prospective juror Cleveland <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>likewise indicated a bias in favor of law enforcement, but rather than moving to challenge Cleveland for cause, Montgomery encouraged Cleveland\u2019s statements and offered his own support for them.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Hartinger notes that, in answering Montgomery\u2019s question about whether he would give more credit to Deputy Hochhalter, who had previously investigated a theft involving Cleveland, than a defendant\u2019s expert, Cleveland stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-4\">I respect the decision generally of law officers. I believe they\u2019re in that position. They\u2019re out there every day doing their job, trying to keep this public that we have now that has changed from what it used to be-The respect of people has changed, and I believe they have a very tough job to do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-5\">My burglary was committed or a theft, I should say, was committed right in broad daylight and by one of two people. We never proved it. We haven\u2019t found-I had antique, or I mean classic car parts, and it was only two people knew where they were. Mr. Hochhalter did a very good job of researching this because of the amount of this type of automobile that\u2019s in the Northwest, and I really appreciate it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">Further, Hartinger points to Montgomery\u2019s response to Cleveland\u2019s answer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-7\">We\u2019re all here exercising our civic duties. We\u2019re all registered voters. We all have not committed any felonies. We are the living proof that the American system of jurisprudence works. This is how it works. My client gets his day in court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-8\">We are all law-abiding people here. And what you\u2019re saying about the officers, does anyone disagree with that? From my perspective, I\u2019m right on with this gentleman here. If an officer says it, because of the line of work that they do and how they put their lives at risk every day, when they put that shield on, that commands respect. Does anyone disagree with that?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-9\">Hartinger asserts that Montgomery pursued an unreasonable trial strategy because it not only bolstered the credibility of police officers who Hartinger later needed to discredit, but also distinguished Hartinger from non-felonious, law-abiding citizens doing their \u201ccivic duties.\u201d Montgomery rehabilitated jurors instead of challenging them, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>and therefore, his performance was deficient and caused prejudice to Hartinger.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">\u00b640 The State counters that Montgomery had a strategical reason for the maimer of his questioning and for his decision not to challenge Snodgrass for cause. Based upon his assessment that the venire had pro-police views, he sought to avoid alienating potential jurors by criticizing police officers and instead deliberately praised police officers in order to elicit statements from the jurors themselves pointing out that police officers are not infallible, a strategy which resulted in a juror responding \u201cpolicemen make mistakes, too.\u201d Thus, a decision by Montgomery to challenge Snodgrass for a bias in favor of police would have been contrary to that strategy. Further, the State argues that Hartinger has offered partial quotes from the transcript, which sound damaging when taken out of context, but which do not tell the whole story.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">\u00b641 A review of the trial transcript and Montgomery\u2019s postconviction testimony does give a larger view. As the District Court found, during Montgomery\u2019s response to Cleveland regarding law-abiding citizens, Montgomery moved to a position behind Hartinger and utilized his arms in a sweeping gesture when stating \u201c[w]e are all law-abiding people here,\u201d in an apparent effort to include Hartinger in that category, and not distinguish him, as Hartinger contends.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">\u00b642 Following Snodgrass\u2019s pro-police comments, Montgomery stressed the importance of the presumption of innocence and the need for the jurors to allow both sides an opportunity to fully present their case. Specifically, Montgomery used cunning questioning to encourage the jurors to think beyond their preconceptions, first using a baseball example:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-7\">Would everyone agree with me-and if you agree with me, raise your hands-would you agree with me that there\u2019s three outs in an inning of baseball? Would you agree? Over here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-8\"><em>Actually, there\u2019s six outs in an inning. </em>Each side gets their turn at bat. That\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about; this presumption of innocence, how it applies every time. No matter how compelling the state\u2019s case is, my man is innocent and he gets his turn at bat. Are you all with me on that? Excellent. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-9\">In further illustration of the presumption of innocence and the need to be fair and impartial, Montgomery held up his hand and asked a prospective juror, \u201cdo you agree this is my hand?\u201d The prospective juror answered \u201cyes.\u201d Montgomery then responded \u201c[a]ctually, the fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>is it\u2019s my hand but it\u2019s not my whole hand. Both sides, front and back, this is my hand,\u201d thereafter explaining that although the State\u2019s attorney will line up evidence in a way that suits his position, the jury must recognize that Montgomery also has the right to present evidence in order to provide the jury with the whole picture. Montgomery then engaged the prospective jurors in a leading discussion, resulting in several prospective jurors expressing their belief that police officers make mistakes. At the end of voir dire, after using these illustrative examples and drawing these answers from the prospective jurors, Montgomery returned to Snodgrass and asked him if he could be fair and impartial, and Snodgrass said he could.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">\u00b643 While Hartinger argues that Montgomery rehabilitated a juror who could have been challenged for cause, that is not per se ineffectiveness. We have held that the decision to challenge a juror for cause in such instances may be a tactical one. As we explained in <em>State v. Herrman:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-5\">A prospective juror, responding to an inquiry during voir dire, may express a certain unfavorable bias or disclose a kinship to law enforcement, for example. The lawyer, nonetheless, in the exercise of his or her professional judgment, may determine that the ostensibly jaundiced response is outweighed by some more favorable off-the-record information that he or she has about that individual. Perhaps the lawyer conferred with his client and advised challenging the juror but the client said \u201cno, I like the person\u2019s body language, I want him on my jury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-6\"><em>Herrman, </em>2003 MT 149, \u00b6 29, 316 Mont. 198, \u00b6 29, 70 P.3d 738, \u00b6 29. Likewise, we rejected Herrman\u2019s argument that there could be no tactical justification for defense counsel to remove a juror by peremptory challenge where the juror likely could have been successfully challenged for cause:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-7\">This contention does not withstand scrutiny. It ignores the fact that peremptory challenges involve a very different dynamic than challenges for cause. Challenges for cause are exercised first, they are unlimited and there is no real advantage to the timing of the challenge. As we recognized in <em>State v. Russell, </em>2001 MT 278, \u00b6 19, 307 Mont. 322, \u00b6 19, 37 P.3d 678, \u00b6 19, peremptory challenges are essentially a matter of trial strategy____Thus, the reasons for exercising a peremptory challenge need not be the same reasons that would have prompted a challenge for cause. For example, counsel\u2019s peremptory challenge to 65-year-old juror Andy may not be based on Andy\u2019s answers to voir dire questions (which may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>have given rise to a challenge for cause), but rather on the fact that counsel would prefer to have a jury composed of young men rather than older men and, in eliminating Andy from the list, 28-year-old Bruce will be moved into the top twelve who will make up the final jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b473-4\"><em>Herrman, </em>\u00b6 31. Thus, the issue here turns on whether Montgomery had a viable, tactical reason for deciding to not challenge Snodgrass for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">\u00b644 First, we have noted that \u00a7 46-16-115, MCA,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> which governs challenges for cause, \u201cdoes not specifically exclude law enforcement officers from serving as jurors in a criminal case.... The bare fact that [a juror] is connected with law enforcement does not, without more, necessitate a finding that he would not be an impartial juror.\u201d <em>State v. Thomson, </em>169 Mont. 158, 163, 545 P.2d 1070, 1073 (1976). Here, after determining that at least ten prospective jurors had served in the military and believing that prospective jurors in Ravalli County were generally conservative, Montgomery decided to say positive things about police officers during voir dire. Montgomery testified he felt that accusing officers would be counterproductive and instead praised officers to (1) demonstrate to jurors that he was reasonable and (2) gain credibility for his case. Montgomery accomplished this in some degree by eliciting comments from prospective jurors that acknowledged officers make mistakes and, further, used Snodgrass and Cleveland as an axis around which to educate the rest of the venire. Montgomery testified that he decided to dismiss prospective juror Snodgrass with a peremptory challenge instead of challenging him for cause, because he believed it was too powerful for this case, in a negative way, to state in front of the prospective jurors that Snodgrass should be removed because he gave incorrect, pro-police answers. Montgomery believed Hartinger would be seen in a more negative light by the jury if he challenged a juror who voiced pro-police views.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">\u00b645  Counsel\u2019s reasonable trial tactics and strategic decisions are entitled to great deference when reviewed on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, <em>State v. Harris, </em>2001 MT 231, \u00b6 22, 306 Mont. 525, \u00b6 22, 36 P.3d 372, \u00b6 22, and we rarely grant relief if there is some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>evidence that the decision was strategic. <em>Henderson, </em>\u00b6 5. Montgomery\u2019s tactics, though not successful, were part of a reasoned strategy and reaffirmed the essence of voir dire, as we explained it in <em>Herrman.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AaS\">\u00b646  Based on a totality of the record, we conclude Montgomery made informed, strategic decisions in his conducting of voir dire. We therefore determine Hartinger has not met his burden under <em>Strickland </em>to prove that Montgomery\u2019s decision to exercise a peremptory challenge, instead of a challenge for cause, constituted deficient performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">\u00b647 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b474-5\">JUSTICES LEAPHART, NELSON, COTTER and WARNER concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b461-8\"> The State later dropped the reckless driving while eluding charge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b463-7\"> A peremptory challenge was not exercised with regard to Cleveland, as he was not numbered low enough in the venire to be among the initial twenty-seven jurors from whom the jury was selected.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b467-9\"> The District Court found that Montgomery believed the first statement was not custodial in nature, but rather \u201ca rhetorical question asked by one officer after he caught up to the main chase, before he relieved his exhausted colleagues and began assisting a dirty, bleeding Hartinger up the hill.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b470-10\"> Cleveland was not in the initial group of jurors on the venire from which the jury was selected, a preemptory challenge was not exercised to remove him, and he did not serve on the jury.
