Snyder (Lois), heir to the Estate of Lucile B. Snyder, deceased, (the Estate) appeals from two orders of the Eighth Judicial District Court, Cascade County, resolving a dispute between Lois and her brother Neil E. Snyder (Neil) over their respective shares of Lucile\u2019s Estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">\u00b62 We review the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">\u00b63 Does Lois present an appealable issue pursuant to the Montana Rules of Appellate Procedure?</p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">\u00b64 Did the District Court err when it ruled that the property still remaining in the Estate should be appraised and distributed based upon its current market value?</p>\n<p id=\"b476-9\">\u00b65 Did the District Court err when it ordered Lois to quitclaim her inherited interest in the Flathead County property back to the Estate?</p>\n<p id=\"b476-10\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b476-11\">\u00b66 Lucile B. Snyder (Lucile) died on November 18,1992, devising her entire Estate to her two children, Neil and Lois. She nominated Neil as the personal representative for her Estate. The Estate included a controlling interest in the Snyder\u2019s family-owned drugstore, Snyder\u2019s, Inc. The Estate also contained a property known as 1227 Fifth Avenue North in Great Falls and 40 acres of undeveloped land in Flathead County.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-12\">\u00b67 Lucile\u2019s will provided, in relevant part, that she \u201cdevise[d] all the rest, residue and remainder of my property ... to my two children, LOIS K. SNYDER and NEIL E. SNYDER, in equal shares, share and share alike.\u201d The will provided, however, that \u201c[f]ifty-one percent (51%) of my stock in [Snyder\u2019s, Inc.]... shall be first apportioned and set aside to make up the share of my total estate which shall go to my son, NEIL E. SNYDER.\u201d The will explained that \u201cit is [Lucile\u2019s] will and desire that [Neil] have said business, or control of the corporate business as the case may be, but without ultimately diminishing the equal distribution of my estate to my two children, whom I hold in equal regard.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b476-13\">\u00b68 Neil filed an application for informal probate and appointment of himself as personal representative on November 25,1992. Neil, acting as the personal representative, proposed to distribute 51% of Lucile\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>stock in Snyder\u2019s, Inc. to himself and 49% of the stock to Lois. He assured Lois that she would be paid cash for the 2% of stock that he would receive in excess of her shares. Neil also proposed that the remainder of the Estate would be divided equally between them. Lois objected. Neil petitioned the District Court to interpret the will after he and Lois failed to agree to a distribution method.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-4\">\u00b69 The District Court adopted Neil\u2019s proposal and ordered that the \u201cpersonal representative must distribute the corporate shares of the decedent 51% to Neil and 49% to Lois.\u201d The court ordered that the \u201cremaining assets must be divided equally between Neil and Lois, except that [Neil] must first distribute to Lois the difference in value between Neil\u2019s 51% and Lois\u2019[s] 49% of those shares.\u201d Accordingly, Neil executed deeds of distribution to Neil and Lois as tenants in common for the Great Falls and Flathead County properties on March 16,1998. The court entered a decree of distribution and order approving Neil\u2019s final accounting of the Estate on May 26,1999. The decree noted that Lois would receive $4,960 in cash to equalize the stock distribution.</p>\n<p id=\"Azn\">\u00b610 Lois successfully appealed the court\u2019s decree of distribution. <em>In Re Estate of Snyder, </em>2000 MT 113, 299 Mont. 421, 2 P.3d 238 <em>(Snyder </em>I). This Court determined that Lucile\u2019s expressed intent required that Neil take the entire interest in Snyder\u2019s, Inc. and that Lois receive estate assets of comparable value. <em>Snyder </em>I, \u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">\u00b611 On remand Lois and Neil engaged in extended litigation over the valuation of the Flathead County property and how it should be distributed in light of this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Snyder </em>I. Both parties agreed that Lois should receive some combination of the Flathead County and Great Falls properties, equal in value to Snyder\u2019s, Inc. The parties\u2019 mutual desire to gain a larger share of the increasingly valuable Flathead County property frustrated their efforts, however, to settle on which property should be distributed first and how that property should be valued.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">\u00b612 Neil proposed that Lois should be compensated for her interest in Snyder\u2019s, Inc. with the Great Falls property. He suggested that she would be compensated with the Flathead County property only to the extent that the value of Snyder\u2019s, Inc. exceeded the value of the Great Falls property. Neil also proposed to value the Great Falls and Flathead County properties at their \u201ccurrent value.\u201d His method would ensure that he would receive approximately one-half of the Flathead County property as its value had appreciated to multiple times the value of the Snyder\u2019s, Inc. shares. Neil stated in 2001 that he believed the Flathead County property to be worth somewhere between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>$1,000,000 and $2,000,000. Neil estimated that Snyder\u2019s, Inc. was worth only around $160,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">\u00b613 Lois proposed that she should receive a share of the Flathead County property equal in value to Snyder\u2019s, Inc, and that all property left in the Estate should be distributed according to its value at Lucile\u2019s time of death, as calculated for federal estate tax purposes. Lois\u2019s method would ensure that she would receive the entire Flathead County property, as its value at the time of Lucile\u2019s death was $160,000 and the value of Snyder\u2019s, Inc. was approximately $190,000.</p>\n<p id=\"Am_\">\u00b614 The District Court rejected Lois\u2019s proposed distribution method and determined instead that the stock and property \u201cshall be valued at current valuation.\u201d The court noted that the Great Falls property was no longer at issue as the property had been \u201csold by agreement of the parties for cash and notes.\u201d Lois appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">\u00b615 We dismissed Lois\u2019s appeal as \u201cnot ripe for appellate review\u201d in our Order dated November 22,2005. We noted that \u201cit is clear from the Order that there remains for determination by the District Court the valuation of the stock and real property contained in the Estate, as well as the distribution of the property to Lois and her brother Neil....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Afi\">\u00b616 Neil then moved the District Court to order Lois \u201cto execute her quitclaim deed to the Estate of Lucile B. Snyder for the real property located in Flathead County.\u201d He argued that our decision in <em>Snyder </em>I had voided his 1998 distribution of the Flathead County property. Neil also requested a \u201cscheduling conference regarding disclosure of expert values of the Flathead Lake property and a hearing date for final distribution of the estate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">\u00b617 The court ordered Lois to quitclaim her interest in the Flathead County property back to the Estate, noting that \u201cLois\u2019[s] successful appeal [in <em>Snyder </em>I] upset the entire scheme of distribution\u201d set forth in the court\u2019s January 25, 1998, order. The court pointed out that it \u201cmust have the flexibility to order distribution of [the Flathead County] property ... by partition, in kind distribution[,] or sale and distribution of proceeds\u201d in order to probate the Estate pursuant to <em>Snyder </em>I. The court explained that \u201c[i]t is highly unlikely that Lois will receive the exact interest in the Flathead property that presently stands in her name.\u201d The District Court directed the parties to exchange names and reports of experts in preparation for a valuation hearing to be held on June 14, 2006. Lois filed her notice of appeal on April 10, 2006, before the court could conduct the valuation hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">\u00b618 The judicial interpretation and construction of a will presents a question of law. <em>Snyder </em>I, \u00b6 8. We review a district court's conclusions of law to determine whether those conclusions are correct. <em>In re Estate of Harms, </em>2006 MT 320, \u00b6 12, 335 Mont. 66, \u00b6 12, 149 P.3d 557, \u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">\u00b619 <em>Does Lois present an appealable issue pursuant to the Montana Rules of Appellate Procedure?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">\u00b620 Lois appeals two orders of the District Court: (1) the September 22,2004, order determining that the remaining estate property should be distributed according to its current market value; and (2) the March 16, 2006, order compelling Lois to quitclaim her interest in the Flathead County property back to the Estate. Neil argues that Lois improperly bases her appeal on M. R. App. P. 1(b)(2) and (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">\u00b621 Rules 1(b)(2) and (3) provide, respectively, that a party may appeal from an order \u201cdirecting the delivery, transfer, or surrender of property,\u201d or an order \u201cagainst or in favor of directing the partition, sale, or conveyance of real property ,...\u201dNeil argues, without authority, that M. R. App. P. 1(b)(2) and (3), are both inapplicable in light of the fact that Lois has no \u201clegal claim\u201d to the Flathead County property. He contends that this Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Snyder </em>I nullified the 1998 distribution by which Lois received her legal interest in the Flathead County property.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-9\">\u00b622 Lois responds that she possesses a valid deed for the Flathead County property and M. R. App. P. 1(b)(2) and (3) provide this Court with authority to hear her appeal. She points out that the plain language of these rules encompasses the court\u2019s order that Lois must \u201c[quitclaim deed] back to the Estate the interest in the Flathead Lake property previously deeded to her.\u201d We agree. The court\u2019s order both directed \u201cthe delivery, transfer, or surrender of property,\u201d under M. R. App. P. 1(b)(2), and represented a ruling \u201cagainst or in favor of directing the partition, sale, or conveyance of real property ...,\u201d under M. R. App. P. 1(b)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-10\">\u00b623 We likewise held in <em>Estate of Murphy, </em>183 Mont. 127, 132-33, 598 P.2d 612, 614-15 (1979), that an order authorizing a personal representative to transfer an estate\u2019s \u201ccash and personal property\u201d to an estate creditor constituted an appealable order pursuant to M. R. App. P. 1. Similarly, in <em>Graveley v. MacLeod, </em>175 Mont. 338, 342, 573 P.2d 1166, 1168 (1978), we held that an order requiring a party to transfer property by means of a contract for deed qualified as an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>appealable order pursuant to M. R. App. P. 1(b)(2). Moreover, neither Neil nor the District Court would have found it necessary to order Lois to quitclaim her interest in the property if she had no legal interest in the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">\u00b624 Neil also argues that Lois lacks a basis on which to appeal from the District Court\u2019s September 22, 2004, order that the stock and property \u201cshall be valued at current valuation.\u201d He points out that we already dismissed this appeal as premature in our order of November 22, 2005. Neil fails to note, however, that Lois\u2019s proper appeal of the court\u2019s March 16, 2006, quitclaim order provides this Court with jurisdiction over both matters. M. R. App. P. 2(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">\u00b625 We faced a similar situation in <em>Hennen v. Omega Enterprises, Inc., </em>264 Mont. 505, 506, 872 P.2d 797, 798-99 (1994), where the plaintiff appealed an adverse ruling on his request for declaratory and injunctive relief. The respondent argued that the plaintiffs failure to seek M. R. Civ. P. 54(b) certification for the declaratory judgment ruling had rendered his appeal premature. <em>Hennen, </em>264 Mont. at 507-08, 872 P.2d at 798-99. We noted, however, that the plaintiff had appealed properly the court\u2019s denial of injunctive relief pursuant to M. R. App. P. 1(b)(2). <em>Hennen, </em>264 Mont. at 507-08, 872 P.2d at 798-99. We clarified that the plaintiffs valid appeal of the court\u2019s denial of his request for an injunction permitted this Court to review both matters pursuant to M. R. App. P. 2. <em>Hennen, </em>264 Mont. at 507-08, 872 P.2d at 798-99.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">\u00b626 The Dissent contends that our order of November 22, 2005, represents the \u201claw of the case\u201d and precludes Lois\u2019s present appeal. We explained in our order that \u201c[w]hile Rule 1(b)(3), M.R.App.P., sets forth multiple judgments or orders entered in estate or probate matters which are immediately appealable even though an estate is not fully and finally closed, the Order in this case is not one of them.\u201d We then illustrated, \u201c[f]or example,\u201d an order directing the distribution or partition of an estate to be appealable. We noted that the Estate had yet to be distributed and that the distribution would not occur \u201cuntil after the court receives the proposed valuations from the parties and holds a hearing on valuations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">\u00b627 This language does not preclude Lois\u2019s present appeal. The law of the case binds the parties only on those issues that the court previously has decided. <em>See Muri v. Frank, </em>2003 MT 316, \u00b6 11, 318 Mont. 269, \u00b6 11, 80 P.3d 77, \u00b6 11. We determined in our November 22, 2005, order that Lois\u2019s appeal lacked any basis under the Montana Rules of Appellate Procedure. We advised her that she would be able <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>to appeal, \u201c[f]or example,\u201d an order directing the distribution or partition of the Estate. We explained, however, that the District Court would have to hold a valuation hearing before it could distribute or partition the Estate. We clarified that Lois could not presently appeal an order \u201cdirecting the distribution or partition\u201d of the Estate as the court had yet to hold a valuation hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-4\">\u00b628 Lois now appeals the court\u2019s order compelling her to quitclaim her Flathead County property back to the Estate. Lois\u2019s present appeal does not involve the distribution or partition of the Estate. Her appeal represents the opposite transaction-the court ordered her to convey property back to the Estate. Her appeal remains valid regardless of whether the court held a valuation hearing, as evidenced by the fact that the court ordered her to quitclaim her property without holding such a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">\u00b629 Moreover, the language in our November 22, 2005, order upon which the Dissent relies represents dictum, intended only to explain our reasoning. Our order did not dictate a precondition to any further appeals in this case. It simply pointed out a necessary precondition to Lois\u2019s hypothetical appeal of a hypothetical order distributing or partitioning the Estate. Our order explained that this hypothetical order \u201cdirecting the distribution or partition of an estate\u201d represented only one of \u201cmultiple judgments or orders entered in estate or probate matters which are immediately appealable ....\u201d Lois now appeals one of the \u201cmultiple judgments\u201d that was not at issue in our order of November 22,2005, and, thus, the law of this case permits her present appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">\u00b630 <em>Did the District Court err when it ruled that the property still remaining in the Estate should be appraised and distributed based upon its current market value?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">\u00b631 Lois argues that the District Court ignored Lucile\u2019s express intent to distribute her Estate according to its value at her death, as calculated for federal estate tax purposes. Lois points to the provision in Lucile\u2019s will that states her intent to distribute the \u201crest, residue and remainder\u201d of her property to Lois and Neil \u201cin equal shares, share and share alike.\u201d The will then provides specific instructions with respect to Snyder\u2019s, Inc.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-8\">Provided further, however, that should the business of Snyder Drug... be not fully incorporated ... at the time of my death; then, ... Snyder Drug ... shall go to my son, NEIL E. SNYDER. If the valuation of said Store and assets connected therewith for Federal Estate tax purposes shall exceed the one-half (1/2) share to go to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>my son NEIL; then to the extent of such excess, the business of SNYDER DRUG... shall nevertheless go and be distributed to my son, NEIL, and be subject to a charge in favor of my daughter, LOIS K. SNYDER, the amount necessary to give her a full one-half (1/2) of my total estate based upon the value thereof as finally determined for Federal Estate Tax purposes....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-4\">If... Snyder Drug shall be owned by Snyder\u2019s, Inc., a Montana Corporation, at the time of my death; then and in that event, Fifty-one percent (51%) of my stock in said corporation, plus whatever amount thereof as is necessary to make a full share of such stock, shall be first apportioned and set aside to make up the share of my total estate which shall go to my son, NEIL E. SNYDER.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">\u00b632 The will anticipates that Snyder\u2019s, Inc. may not be fully incorporated at the time of Lucile\u2019s death. The will instructs the personal representative to distribute Snyder\u2019s, Inc. according to its value for federal estate tax purposes if Snyder\u2019s, Inc. is not fully incorporated. The will also notes that Lois should be compensated with other property from the Estate, based on its value for federal estate tax purposes, to the extent that Neil\u2019s share of Snyder\u2019s, Inc. exceeds one-half the value of the Estate. The will provides, in the alternative, that 51% of Snyder\u2019s, Inc. stock shall be distributed to Neil and 49% to Lois if the company is fully incorporated at the time of Lucile\u2019s death. The will makes no mention of a valuation method in the event of this contingency.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">\u00b633 The court determined that Snyder\u2019s, Inc.\u2019s incorporated status at the time of Lucile\u2019s death rendered inoperative \u201cthe provision for valuation at estate tax values ....\u201d The court ordered, pursuant to \u00a7 72-3-902(2)(b), MCA, that the Estate assets should be valued as of the date of distribution. Section 72-3-902(2)(b), MCA, provides that \u201c[u]nless a contrary intention is indicated by the will,... the property distributed in kind is valued at fair market value as of the date of its distribution....\u201d The court explained that Lucile\u2019s \u201ccontrary intention\u201d to value her Estate pursuant to the federal estate tax applied only in the event that Snyder\u2019s, Inc. was unincorporated at the time of her death. Snyder\u2019s, Inc. remained incorporated at the time of Lucile\u2019s death. The court concluded, therefore, that \u00a7 72-3-902(2)(b), MCA, required that her Estate be \u201cvalued at fair market value as of the date of its distribution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">\u00b634 We stated in <em>Snyder </em>I that \u201c[t]he testator['s] intent controls the distribution of assets pursuant to a will\u201d and that we derive the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>testator\u2019s intent \u201c \u2018from all parts of the will... construed in relation to each other ... to form one consistent whole.\u2019 \u201d <em>Snyder </em>I, \u00b6 10 (quoting <em>Matter of Estate of Evans, </em>217 Mont. 89, 94, 704 P.2d 35, 38). We further noted that the words of a will \u201care to receive an interpretation which will give some effect to every expression, rather than an interpretation which will render any of the expressions inoperative.\u201d <em>Snyder </em>I, \u00b6 15 (quoting <em>Matter of Estate of Bolinger, </em>284 Mont. 114, 121, 943 P.2d 981, 985 (1997)).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\">\u00b635 The will, when read as a whole, indicates that Lucile intended to have the Estate distributed pursuant to its value at her death, as calculated for federal estate tax purposes. The -will specifically instructs the personal representative on how to value the Estate at two places in the excerpt discussed in \u00b6 31, <em>supra. </em>The will specifies in both instances that the value for federal estate tax purposes should be used. The will\u2019s failure to state explicitly that the federal estate tax valuation method should be used in the event that Snyder\u2019s, Inc. remained fully incorporated likely shows no more than that Lucile failed to anticipate that the value of her Estate might change drastically while litigation delayed its probate for nearly a decade.</p>\n<p id=\"AI3\">\u00b636 Where the will did anticipate that a specific valuation method might be needed, however, the will provided that the Estate should be valued at the time of Lucile\u2019s death, pursuant to the calculation for federal estate tax purposes. This interpretation gives effect to the will\u2019s twice stated provision that Lucile\u2019s Estate should be valued at the time of Lucile\u2019s death. <em>Bolinger, </em>284 Mont. at 121, 943 P.2d at 985. This interpretation also comports with Lucile\u2019s intent that Lois and Neil each would receive half of the value of the Estate with Neil\u2019s half to include Snyder\u2019s, Inc. <em>Snyder </em>I, \u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">\u00b637  We can find no support in the text of the will for the proposition that Lucile intended to make the value of the entire Estate depend on whether Snyder\u2019s, Inc. remained incorporated at the time of her death. We conclude that the District Court erred in determining that Lucile\u2019s remaining Estate should be distributed according to its current market value. <em>Harms, </em>\u00b6 12. Our determination that Lucile intended for her Estate to be distributed according to its value for federal estate tax purposes precludes the application of \u00a7 72-3-902(2)(b), MCA. We instruct the court on remand to conduct the valuation and distribution of the remaining Estate based on the Estate\u2019s value as calculated for purposes of the federal estate tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">\u00b638 <em>Did the District Court err when it ordered Lois to quitclaim her inherited interest in the Flathead County property back to the Estate?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b484-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>\u00b639 Lois argues that the court failed to comply with \u00a7 72-3-906, MCA, when it ordered Lois to quitclaim her interest in the Flathead County property back to the Estate. Section 72-3-906, MCA, provides, in relevant part, that <em>\u201ca </em>distributee of property improperly distributed... is liable to return the property improperly received ....\u201d Lois asserts that the property was not \u201cimproperly received\u201d in light of the fact that she will be entitled to at least a one-half interest in the property under any conceivable distribution. She points out that the District Court\u2019s order states that \u201c[i]t is highly likely that Lois will receive at least one-half of the Flathead County property or its value.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">\u00b640 Lois also argues that the District Court erroneously justified the quitclaim order based on its need for the \u201cflexibility to order distribution of that property to be accomplished by partition, in kind distribution!),] or sale and distribution of proceeds ....\u201d She contends that the court has only two options in distributing the Flathead County property: (1) partition, sell the property, and distribute the proceeds pursuant to \u00a7 70-29-101, MCA; or (2) distribute the property in kind pursuant to \u00a7 72-3-902, MCA. She correctly points out that the court has the \u201cflexibility\u201d to partition the property without requiring her first to quitclaim her property interest back to the Estate. Section 70-29-101, MCA, authorizes an action for partition when property is under the ownership of \u201cseveral cotenants ... as joint tenants or tenants in common ....\u201d She also argues that a distribution in kind would not require her to deed any interest in her property back to the Estate in light of the fact that she will receive an interest in the Flathead County property larger than or equal to her current interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">\u00b641  Neil offers no argument regarding whether the court erred in compelling Lois to quitclaim her interest in the Flathead County property or what law should govern this issue. We also note that Lois is unlikely to receive less than one half of the Estate in light of our holding at \u00b6\u00b6 31-37, <em>supra. </em>The court\u2019s order appears, at best, to add an unnecessary step in the court\u2019s resolution of this Estate. <em>See DeVoe v.Department of Revenue, </em>263 Mont. 100, 115, 866 P.2d 228, 238(1993) (noting that neither law nor equity require useless acts). We cannot say under these circumstances that the court correctly ordered Lois to quitclaim her interest in the Flathead County property. <em>In re Estate of Harms, </em>\u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">\u00b642 We reverse the District Court\u2019s September 22, 2004, order determining that the remaining estate property should be distributed according to its current market value.

I believe that the District Court Judge was correct and I would have affirmed. In my view, the Court simply re-wrote Lucile\u2019s will and frustrated her testamentary intent and estate plan. Now, Lois is, unfortunately, the victim of her own success in <em>Snyder I. </em>That, however, is water over the dam. <em>Snyder I </em>is the law of this case and must be followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-8\">\u00b645 I would dismiss the instant appeal without prejudice as being interlocutory. While under other circumstances I would agree with the Court\u2019s analysis of M. R. App. P. 1(b)(2) and (3), I believe that we have already dealt with the appealability issue and have, in so doing, created a law of the case that must be followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-9\">\u00b646 Under the law of the case doctrine, a prior decision of this Court resolving an issue between the same parties is binding and may not be relitigated. <em>Muri v. Frank, </em>2003 MT 316, \u00b6 11, 318 Mont. 269, \u00b6 11, 80 P.3d 77, \u00b6 11. This doctrine \u201cexpresses the practice of courts generally to refuse to reopen what has been decided.\u201d <em>Scott v. Scott, </em>283 Mont. 169, 175, 939 P.2d 998, 1001 (1997) (quoting <em>Fiscus v. Beartooth Elec. Cooperative, Inc., </em>180 Mont. 434, 436, 591 P.2d 196, 197 (1979); see <em>also State v. Van Dyken, </em>242 Mont. 415, 791 P.2d 1350 (1990), <em>cert. denied, </em>498 U.S. 920, 111 S. Ct. 297 (1990) (this Court\u2019s earlier decision rendered in response to defendant\u2019s application for writ of supervisory control addressing the issue of failure to poll the jury before declaring a mistrial, remained binding and could not be relitigated under the law of the case doctrine)).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-10\">\u00b647 In this Court\u2019s November 22, 2005 Order dismissing Lois\u2019s appeal, we not only made the statement referred to in \u00b6 15 of the Opinion, but we also stated: \u201cFor example, an order directing the distribution or partition of an estate is appealable; <em>here, however, the Estate has yet to be distributed. This will not occur until after the court receives the proposed valuations from the parties and holds a hearing on valuations.\u201d </em>On that basis, we determined that Lois\u2019s appeal was not final under M. R. App. P. 1. (November 22, 2005 Order dismissing the appeal in this Court\u2019s Cause No. 04-727 (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>\u00b648 Clearly, we dismissed Lois\u2019s prior appeal because the property had yet to be valued or distributed. That was the situation when Lois filed her instant appeal-and still is. Neither of the orders appealed from valued or distributed the property; both were simply interlocutory orders entered in preparation for valuing and distributing the property; neither were certified as final for purposes of appeal under M. R. Civ. P. 54(b). Accordingly, and regardless of whether the orders might otherwise be appealable under the Montana Rules of Appellate Procedure, they are not appealable under the law of this case pursuant to our November 22, 2005 Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">\u00b649 Unfortunately, in not allowing the trial court to value and finally distribute Lucile\u2019s estate, we will, no doubt, subject the District Court, the parties, and this Court to an endless round of piece-meal appeals as this case moves forward.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">\u00b650 I would dismiss this appeal without prejudice; I would allow the District Court to complete its valuation and distribution of the Estate; and I respectfully dissent from our decision to the contrary.</p>\n<judges id=\"b486-6\">JUSTICE COTTER joins in the dissent of JUSTICE NELSON.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
