We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-12\">\u00b62 We address the following issues:</p>\n<p id=\"b275-13\">\u00b63 1. Is Phillips\u2019postconviction claim procedurally barred by \u00a746-21-105(2), MCA?</p>\n<p id=\"b276-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>\u00b64 2. Did the District Court err in denying Phillips\u2019 petition for postconviction relief?</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">\u00b65 3. Did the District Court err in denying Phillips\u2019 motion to withdraw his guilty plea?</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">\u00b66 On January 8, 2004, Phillips was charged with having sexual intercourse without consent, in violation of \u00a7 45-5-503, MCA. Phillips entered a plea agreement with the State, wherein the State agreed to recommend a six-year sentence to the Department of Corrections (DOC) with all time suspended. As part of the plea agreement, Phillips signed an acknowledgment of waiver of rights, which provided that: Phillips understood he could be sentenced to the maximum punishment authorized by law; the prosecutor\u2019s recommendation was not binding upon the District Court when it imposed sentence; the District Court was not bound by the plea agreement, but rather \u201cthe sentence to be imposed is within the sole discretion of the [District Court] and the State does not make any promise or representation as to what the sentence will be.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">\u00b67 Phillips entered a guilty plea to the District Court on October 21, 2004. The court accepted the plea and ordered Phillips to undergo a presentence investigation (PSI) and psychosexual evaluation. Dr. Michael Scolatti conducted the psychosexual evaluation and in his report indicated that Phillips had disclosed a prior conviction for a sex offense in the Salish and Kootenai Tribal Court (Tribal Court) and had admitted to committing uncharged juvenile sexual offenses with approximately twelve or thirteen different victims. Probation and Parole Officer Mark Doering drafted the PSI and specifically referred to Dr. Scolatti\u2019s psychosexual evaluation in the PSI. Further, letters from Phillips\u2019 great uncles, James and Stephen Clairmont, indicating that, as a juvenile, Phillips had sexually assaulted very young female relatives and that he had been charged as a juvenile in Tribal Court, were also attached to the PSI. Phillips made no objection to the PSI.</p>\n<p id=\"AjE\">\u00b68 At the sentencing hearing on May 17, 2005, the State recommended the sentence as agreed, but the District Court nonetheless sentenced Phillips to the DOC for a term of eight years with five years suspended. However, the District Court recommended that Phillips be screened for and placed in the DOC\u2019s intensive supervision program (ISP) for a minimum of thirty months, adding that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-8\">In the event for some reason you are not accepted in the ISP <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>program that\u2019s recommended, that secondarily, but only secondarily, that you be recommended for prerelease to the extent that the Court\u2019s recommendation has any impact on DOC and that placement, and I believe that the prerelease program should continue for the same time period, a minimum of at least 30 months.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">Phillips did not appeal his conviction or the District Court\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"AxX\">\u00b69 However, Phillips thereafter asserted that, on July 22, 2005, or about sixty-four days after his sentencing order and judgment was entered, he discovered that his juvenile record from the Tribal Court, released upon order by Tribal Court Judge Gary Acevedo, had been illegally requested by the State. Thus, on August 11, 2005, Phillips filed a petition for postconviction relief, alleging that his juvenile Tribal Court record had been illegally released, that both the PSI and Dr. Scolatti\u2019s report contained information from his juvenile record,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and that his sentence in this matter was therefore illegal and in violation of due process. Phillips argued that because his juvenile record was made available to the DOC, his sentencing and status with the DOC was adversely affected. Phillips likewise filed a motion to withdraw his guilty plea, premised on the same grounds as his postconviction petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">\u00b610 The District Court concluded that the State had acted properly in obtaining the juvenile record for purposes of sentencing, that the information was properly considered, and that it had \u201cno evidence upon which to analyze the workings of the tribal court.\u201d The District Court further concluded that \u201cthe disputed information was obtained from [Phillips] himself by [Dr. Scolatti]. Therefore, nothing is gained for [Phillips] by striking his tribal juvenile record.\u201d The court denied both the petition and the motion for plea withdrawal. Phillips appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">\u00b611 We review a district court\u2019s denial of a postconviction petition to determine whether its findings of fact are clearly erroneous and whether its conclusions of law are correct. <em>Davis v. </em>State, 2004 MT 112, \u00b6 13, 321 Mont. 118, \u00b6 13, 88 P.3d 1285, \u00b6 13. When the issue on appeal concerns whether the district court violated the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights at sentencing, the question is a matter of law which we review de novo to determine whether the district court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>interpretation of the law is correct. <em>State v. Bedwell, </em>1999 MT 206, \u00b6 4, 295 Mont. 476, \u00b6 4, 985 P.2d 150, \u00b6 4; <em>State v. Guillaume, </em>1999 MT 29, \u00b6 7, 293 Mont. 224, \u00b6 7, 975 P.2d 312, \u00b6 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">\u00b612 We review a defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw a guilty plea to determine if the guilty plea was voluntary. Our determination of whether a plea was voluntary is a mixed question of law and fact, which we review de novo. <em>State v. Frazier, </em>2007 MT 40, \u00b6 8, 336 Mont. 81, \u00b6 8, 153 P.3d 18, \u00b6 8 (citing <em>State v. Muhammad, </em>2005 MT 234, \u00b6 12, 328 Mont. 397, \u00b6 12, 121 P.3d 521, \u00b6 12).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">\u00b613 <em>1. Is Phillips\u2019postconviction sentencing claim procedurally barred by \u00a7 46-21-105(2), MCA?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">\u00b614 As an initial matter, the State argues that Phillips\u2019 postconviction petition is procedurally barred because Phillips could have raised his claim on direct appeal. The statute provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-8\">When a petitioner has been afforded the opportunity for a direct appeal of the petitioner\u2019s conviction, grounds for relief that were or could reasonably have been raised on direct appeal may not be raised, considered, or decided in a proceeding brought under this chapter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b278-9\">Section 46-21-105(2), MCA. Noting that Phillips did not appeal his sentence, the State asserts that Phillips\u2019 claim cannot now be brought. Phillips responds that he was not aware that the juvenile record had been illegally unsealed until July 22,2005-more than sixty days after the District Court entered a written sentence on May 19, 2005-and thus the procedural bar of \u00a7 46-21-105(2), MCA, does not apply here by its own terms. Phillips further points to \u00a7 46-21-101(1), MCA, which provides that postconviction relief is the appropriate remedy for criminal defendants convicted of an offense, but who have no adequate remedy of appeal, and that, for him, the remedy of appeal was inadequate because he did not know about the error in the sentencing process until after his appeal time had expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-10\">\u00b615  Although it is clear that Phillips\u2019 Tribal Court record was attached to the PSI, and, therefore, Phillips had notice of its release during the sentencing process, for purposes of this appeal we take at face value Phillips\u2019 assertion that he did not realize the record had been \u201cillegally released\u201d until July 22, 2005. Thus, Phillips was not aware of the issue which became the grounds for his postconviction petition until more than sixty days after the District Court imposed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>sentence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At that point the time for appeal had expired, and Phillips could not have reasonably raised the issue on appeal. Thus, we hold that Phillips\u2019 postconviction sentencing claim is not procedurally barred by \u00a7 46-21-105(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\">\u00b616 <em>2. Did the District Court err in denying Phillips\u2019 petition for postconviction relief?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">\u00b617  The due process clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article II, Section 17, of the Montana Constitution protect a defendant from being sentenced based upon misinformation. <em>State v. Mason, </em>2003 MT 371, \u00b6 21, 319 Mont. 117, \u00b6 21, 82 P.3d 903, \u00b6 21; <em>Bauer v. State, </em>1999 MT 185, \u00b6 20, 295 Mont. 306, \u00b6 20, 983 P.2d 955, \u00b6 20. If a defendant seeks to overturn a sentence, \u201cthe defendant has an affirmative duty to show the alleged misinformation is materially inaccurate.\u201d <em>State v. Harper, </em>2006 MT 259, \u00b6 18, 334 Mont. 138, \u00b6 18, 144 P.3d 826, \u00b6 18; <em>State v. Bar-Jonah, </em>2004 MT 344, \u00b6 120, 324 Mont. 278, \u00b6 120, 102 P.3d 1229, \u00b6 120. \u201cMerely claiming the information is invalid is insufficient.\u201d <em>Harper, </em>\u00b6 18; <em>Bar-Jonah, </em>\u00b6 120; <em>State v. Radi, </em>185 Mont. 38, 41, 604 P.2d 318, 320 (1979). Finally, \u201cwhere a sentencing court is found not to have relied on improper or erroneous information in sentencing a criminal defendant, there is \u2018nothing to correct or rebut\u2019 and, therefore, the defendant is not entitled to resentencing on due process grounds.\u201d <em>Mason, </em>\u00b6 21; <em>Bauer, </em>\u00b6 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">\u00b618 Phillips argues that his juvenile record was illegally obtained by the State because it was obtained without the notice required under tribal statutes, and thus, his juvenile record should have been excluded from the PSI and from consideration at sentencing, resulting in a violation of his due process rights and an illegal sentence. Phillips argues that the inclusion of the Tribal Court juvenile record caused the District Court to impose a harsher sentence than that recommended in the plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">\u00b619 The State argues that Phillips\u2019 juvenile record was not illegally released pursuant to Tribal Court rule, that Phillips has not presented any evidence that the information contained in his juvenile record and presented at the sentencing hearing was materially false, and his due process rights were not violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">\u00b620 Like the District Court, we decline to address Phillips\u2019 argument that his juvenile record was illegally released under tribal law. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>record was released by order of the Tribal Court. As we have stated, \u201cMontana judicial policy avoids interfering with the tribal courts and the respective tribe\u2019s sovereignty.\u201d <em>State v. Spotted Eagle, </em>2003 MT 172, \u00b6 30, 316 Mont. 370, \u00b6 30, 71 P.3d 1239, \u00b6 30. However, we need not resolve this issue of tribal law to resolve this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">\u00b621  First, Phillips introduced no evidence indicating his juvenile record or any of the information in the PSI was \u201cmaterially inaccurate.\u201d <em>Harper, </em>\u00b6 18. Indeed, Phillips admitted the tribal conviction and numerous uncharged juvenile sexual offenses to Dr. Scolatti. Family letters noting the tribal conviction and other sexual offenses upon relatives were attached to the PSI. None of this evidence was objected to at the sentencing hearing. Further, Phillips introduced no evidence that the Tribal Court record of his single juvenile conviction somehow impacted the DOC\u2019s placement review separate and apart from the other evidence in the case. We have held that juvenile records may be noted in a PSI, and considered at sentencing, because the information in a PSI is also not publicly disseminated. <em>Radi, </em>185 Mont. at 44, 604 P.2d at 322.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">\u00b622  Phillips cannot claim to have been prejudiced by the Tribal Court record. His due process rights were not violated. We conclude the District Court did not err in dismissing Phillips\u2019 petition for postconviction relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">\u00b623 <em>3. Did the District Court err in denying Phillips\u2019 motion to withdraw his guilty plea?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">\u00b624 Section 46-16-105(2), MCA, permits a defendant to withdraw a guilty plea, before or after judgment is entered, if \u201cgood cause\u201d is shown. Guilty pleas must be voluntary, knowing, and intelligent. <em>State v. Favi, </em>2005 MT 288, \u00b6 11, 329 Mont. 273, \u00b6 11, 124 P.3d 164, \u00b6 11; <em>Bousley v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 614, 618, 118 S. Ct. 1604, 1609 (1998); <em>Brady v. United States, </em>397 U.S. 742, 748, 90 S. Ct. 1463, 1469 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">\u00b625 Phillips does not argue that his plea was involuntary, but that events occurred which gave him \u201cgood cause\u201d to allow withdrawal of his plea under \u00a7 46-16-105(2), MCA. Citing <em>State v. Lone Elk, </em>2005 MT 56, \u00b6 19, 326 Mont. 214, \u00b6 19, 108 P.3d 500, \u00b6 19, for the proposition that \u201cintervening circumstances\u201d may constitute good cause for the withdrawal of a guilty plea, Phillips contends that the illegal release of his juvenile record and the consequential failure of the DOC to adopt the District Court\u2019s recommendation of ISP are such \u201cintervening circumstances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b280-9\">\u00b626 We conclude that Phillips\u2019 argument is unpersuasive. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>argument is premised upon the hopes or expectations Phillips held in the sentencing process. He hoped for an ISP recommendation from the District Court and he hoped for an ISP placement from the DOC. However, neither of these was assured to Phillips. The plea agreement and waiver of rights signed by Phillips made abundantly clear that the prosecutor\u2019s recommendation was not binding upon the court and that the sentence imposed was within the complete discretion of the court, including the possibility of receiving the maximum sentence under law. Thus, there was no promise of an ISP recommendation. Although the District Court did recommend that Phillips be placed in ISP, the court was also clear that it was making a recommendation only, and that the ultimate decision would rest with the DOC. As Probation and Parole Officer Doering testified, once Phillips was sentenced to the DOC, he could be placed in ISP, prerelease, boot camp, or the Montana State Prison. In other words, Phillips\u2019 placement was in the hands of the DOC-not the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">\u00b627  Under these circumstances, we cannot conclude that Phillips\u2019 objection to the release of his juvenile record establishes good cause for withdrawal of his guilty plea. The District Court correctly denied his motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">\u00b628 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b281-6\">JUSTICES WARNER, LEAPHART, MORRIS and NELSON concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b277-8\"> Phillips was prosecuted at age fourteen in the Youth Court of the Confederated Salish Kootenai Tribes of the Flathead Reservation (Tribal Court) for sexual assault.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b279-9\"> M.R.App.P. 5(b) provides that an appeal from a criminal judgment must be taken within sixty days.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
