On February 28, 2007, we issued an order granting Respondent District Court, the Attorney General, and the Gallatin County Attorney twenty days in which to file a response to the Petition. A response was filed by the Attorney General on March 20, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">\u00b62 Having considered the parties\u2019 arguments, we grant the Petition, reverse the decision of the District Court denying Petitioners\u2019 respective motions to preclude the State from seeking the death penalty upon their convictions, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion and Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">\u00b63 1. Are the issues presented by Petitioners appropriate for resolution by this Court through a writ of supervisory control?</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court err in denying Petitioners\u2019 motions to preclude the State from seeking the death penalty and to preclude imposition of the death penalty as a sentence?</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">\u00b65 Petitioners are presently defendants in cause numbers DC 06-213B (Miller) and DC 06-212B (LeBrum) filed in the District Court for the Eighteenth Judicial District, Gallatin County. They are accused of deliberate homicide, aggravated kidnapping, and tampering with or fabricating physical evidence, all felonies, and the Gallatin County Attorney has given notice stating that he intends to seek the death penalty in both cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">\u00b66 However, the prosecutor did not file this notice in compliance with this Court\u2019s Standards for Competency of Counsel for Indigent Persons in Death Penalty Cases (\u201cthe Standards\u201d). Specifically, Standard I.1.a. of the Standards states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-9\">In any case in which death is a potential punishment, the prosecutor shall comply with Section 46-1-401, MCA, and shall file with the district court, within 60 days after arraignment, and serve upon counsel of record a notice stating whether the prosecutor intends to seek the death penalty upon a conviction in the case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b516-10\">The prosecutor complied with \u00a7 46-1-401, MCA, by alleging aggravating circumstances in each Information; but Petitioners were arraigned on July 18, 2006, and the prosecutor, therefore, was required by Standard I.l.a. to file notice stating whether he intended to seek the death penalty by September 18, 2006.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He did not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"A7SA\">\u00b67 Consequently, on November 8, 2006, Petitioners filed separate motions to preclude the State from seeking the death penalty and to preclude imposition of the death penalty as a sentence. Petitioners based their motions (which contained essentially the same legal arguments and analysis) on the Due Process Clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and Article II, Section 17 of the Montana Constitution, the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clauses of the Eighth Amendment to the United States <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>Constitution and Article II, Section 22 of the Montana Constitution, and on this Court\u2019s constitutional rulemaking authority (Mont. Const. art. VII, \u00a7 2(3)) pursuant to which the Standards were promulgated. With respect to our constitutional rulemaking authority, Petitioners contended that the Standards were \u201cvalidly enacted\u201d by this Court, that the Standards are \u201cin full force and effect\u201d in Petitioners\u2019 cases, and that the Standards \u201cprovide for no exception to the sixty-day notice requirement.\u201d Thus, because the prosecutor did not file his notice of intent<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> within 60 days after Petitioners\u2019 arraignments, as required by Standard I.1.a., they argued that the State is precluded from seeking the death penalty upon their convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-3\">\u00b68 On November 27, 2006-132 days after Petitioners\u2019 arraignments and 72 days after the Standard I.l.a. deadline-the prosecutor filed his notice of intent to seek the death penalty. That same day, he also filed a response to Petitioners\u2019 motions, in which he argued that \u201c[b]ecause the Information filed in both cases specifies that death is a possible punishment, and specifies the aggravating circumstances that may lead to a death sentence, the Defendants have since the inception of this case been fully aware of the possible consequences of conviction.\u201d He also argued that \u201c[w]hat is more important, and what the State asks this Court to focus upon in deciding Defendants\u2019 motions, is that the Defendants have not been prejudiced by the undersigned\u2019s failure, until this date, to file the notice required by the Standards.\u201d In this regard, he contended that Petitioners had failed in their motions to show that they had been prejudiced by the late filing of his notice of intent (although the Standards do not explicitly require such a showing).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\">\u00b69 On December 11, 2006, LeBrum filed a combined reply to the prosecutor\u2019s response, objection to the prosecutor\u2019s late filing of his notice of intent, and motion to strike said notice, in which Miller joined. Acknowledging that he was aware the case was a <em>potential </em>capital case, he contended that such knowledge does not transform the case into an <em>actual </em>capital case. Rather, \u201cthe State must comply with all pleading, procedural, and notice requirements, including [Standard I.1.a.,] to convert a <em>potential </em>capital case into an <em>actual </em>capital case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AtG\">\u00b610 LeBrum also contested the factual accuracy of the prosecutor\u2019s assertion (in his November 27, 2006 response) that \u201cDefense counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>have at all times been aware that this case was a death penalty case.\u201d Citing a recent article in the Bozeman Daily Chronicle <em>(see </em>Ted Sullivan, <em>Defense argues against death penalty in Wright homicide case, </em>Bozeman Daily Chronicle A3 (November 14, 2006)), LeBrum pointed out that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-4\">the prosecutor himself stated he has not decided whether he will seek the death penalty, and that he won\u2019t decide whether he\u2019ll seek the death penalty until he receives all of the evidence in the case and discusses capital punishment with the victim\u2019s family. [Citation to article.] Since the prosecutor has admitted that even he did not know if he intended to seek the death penalty, it is contradictory and disingenuous for the prosecutor to allege the Defendant knew all along that the prosecutor intended to seek the death penalty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">\u00b611 Finally, with respect to the prosecutor\u2019s argument that Petitioners had not been prejudiced by the late filing of his notice of intent, LeBrum maintained that the Standards contain no exception to the 60-day deadline based on lack of prejudice to the defendant. He pointed out that this Court had deleted such an exception from Standard I.1. in the 2002 amendments to the Standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">\u00b612 The District Court issued a Decision and Order in each cause number on January 9, 2007, applying the same analysis in each. Reasoning that the Standards \u201care silent as to the consequences of the prosecutor\u2019s failure to file the required notice\u201d and that \u201cabsent prejudice, the violation of a procedural rule designed to safeguard a constitutional right is not necessarily the same thing as a violation of the right itself\u2019 (alteration and internal quotation marks omitted), the court adopted the approach suggested by the prosecutor-i.e., the court focused on whether Petitioners had been prejudiced by the prosecutor\u2019s late filing of his notice of intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">\u00b613 In this regard, the court observed that \u201cDefendant was aware of the possible imposition of the death penalty at the inception of this case\u201d and that \u201cDefendant [now] has advance notice of the State\u2019s intent to seek the death penalty in order for the Defendant to prepare an adequate defense.\u201d Therefore, the court concluded, \u201cthe State\u2019s failure to file the notice within the time prescribed by the Standard has not prejudiced the Defendant and has not violated Defendant\u2019s rights to due process under the United States and Montana Constitutions.\u201d Accordingly, the court denied Petitioners\u2019 motions to preclude the State from seeking the death penalty and to preclude imposition of the death penalty as a sentence. The court also denied Petitioners\u2019 objections to the prosecutor\u2019s late filing of his death <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>penalty notice and Petitioners\u2019 motions to strike said notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-3\">\u00b614 Petitioners filed the instant Petition for Writ of Supervisory Control on February 15, 2007. They contend that the District Court\u2019s decision constitutes a mistake of law and is causing a gross injustice. They further contend that no adequate remedy exists on appeal. Accordingly, Petitioners request that this Court exercise supervisory control over these cases, review the District Court\u2019s decision, and preclude the State from seeking the death penalty upon their convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">\u00b615 <em>Issue 1. Are the issues presented by Petitioners appropriate for resolution by this Court through a writ of supervisory </em>control?</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">\u00b616 This Court has \u201cgeneral supervisory control over all other courts\u201d pursuant to Article VII, Section 2(2) of the Montana Constitution. Supervisory control, however, is \u201can extraordinary remedy\u201d to be exercised only in \u201cextraordinary circumstances.\u201d <em>Evans v. Montana Eleventh Judicial Dist. Court, </em>2000 MT 38, \u00b6 15, 298 Mont. 279, \u00b6 15, 995 P.2d 455, \u00b6 15; <em>Park v. Montana Sixth Judicial Dist. Court, </em>1998 MT 164, \u00b6 13, 289 Mont. 367, \u00b6 13, 961 P.2d 1267, \u00b6 13. Thus, we have explained that we exercise supervisory control only when a district court is proceeding under a mistake of law and, in so doing, is causing a gross injustice, and the normal appeal process is not an adequate remedy. <em>Evans, </em>\u00b6 15; <em>Park, </em>\u00b6 13; <em>Plumb v. Montana Fourth Judicial Dist. Court, </em>279 Mont. 363, 369-70, 927 P.2d 1011, 1015-16 (1996). We make this determination on a case-by-case basis. <em>Inter-Fluve v. Montana Eighteenth Judicial Dist. Court, </em>2005 MT 103, \u00b6 17, 327 Mont. 14, \u00b6 17, 112 P.3d 258, \u00b6 17; <em>Dusek v. Montana Eighth Judicial Dist. Court, </em>2003 MT 303, \u00b6 6, 318 Mont. 166, \u00b6 6, 79 P.3d 292, \u00b6 6.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AgP\">\u00b617 On December 15,1997, during the period in which this Court was receiving public comment on the Proposed Standards for Competency of Counsel for Indigent Persons in Death Penalty Cases, the Attorney General filed a response to comments filed by the Appellate Defender and the Federal Defender. Addressing the concern that trial courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>might \u201cbe free to disregard the competency standards with impunity,\u201d the Attorney General took the position that \u201ccoercive remedies such as mandamus, that are designed to compel the court to follow the law,\u201d would be available in situations where the trial court failed to follow the Standards. For instance, he noted that \u201c[t]he law creates a duty on the part of the trial judge to appoint counsel meeting the standards,\u201d and \u201c[i]f the court fails in this duty, nothing in the law would prevent the petitioner from seeking mandamus or other extraordinary relief in this Court to require that the law be followed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">\u00b618 Without distinguishing its earlier position, however, the State now argues that the District Court\u2019s failure to enforce Standard I.1.a.\u2019s 60-day deadline does not warrant extraordinary relief and that this Court should decline Petitioners\u2019 request that we exercise supervisory control. The State reasons that if Petitioners are convicted and the District Court thereafter imposes a sentence of death, \u201cthen Petitioners may challenge any and all of the district court\u2019s pretrial decisions . .. in the course of a direct appeal.\u201d The State urges that \u201c[t]he fact that the case involves the possible imposition of the death penalty does not render the remedy of appeal inadequate.\u201d Rather, in the State\u2019s view, \u201cPetitioners have a wholly adequate remedy of appeal.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"Azu\">\u00b619 We find the circumstances faced by Petitioners here to be analogous to the circumstances faced by the petitioner in <em>Booth v. Montana Twenty-First Judicial Dist. Court, </em>1998 MT 344, 292 Mont. 371, 972 P.2d 325. In <em>Booth, </em>Booth\u2019s application for a writ of supervisory control implicated double jeopardy considerations: \u201cIf the District Court\u2019s conclusion that the prosecution is not barred proved-on appeal-to be incorrect, Booth would have been subjected to prosecution notwithstanding his entitlement to avoid the prosecution altogether.\u201d <em>Booth, </em>\u00b6 6. We concluded that under such circumstances, appeal would not be an adequate remedy and that Booth\u2019s application presented legal issues that were appropriate for this Court to resolve through a writ of supervisory control. <em>Booth, </em>\u00b6 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">\u00b620  Here, the District Court concluded that the Standards did not bar the prosecutor from filing his notice of intent to seek the death penalty 72 days after Standard I.1.a.\u2019s 60-day deadline had expired and from seeking the death penalty upon Petitioners\u2019 convictions. As explained below under Issue 2, this conclusion is incorrect. Thus, the District Court is proceeding under a mistake of law and, as a result, Petitioners are being subjected to prosecutions as capital defendants, notwithstanding their entitlement to avoid being prosecuted as such altogether. For this reason, the District Court\u2019s ruling is causing a gross injustice for which an appeal after trial is not an adequate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>remedy. Under these circumstances, we hold that the issues presented in the Petition are appropriate for resolution by this Court through a writ of supervisory control.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-3\">\u00b621 <em>Issue 2. Did the District Court err in denying Petitioners\u2019 motions to preclude the State from seeking the death penalty and to preclude imposition of the death penalty as a sentence?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">\u00b622 The District Court\u2019s conclusion that the prosecutor was permitted to file his notice of intent to seek the death penalty after the 60-day deadline had expired was based on the court\u2019s interpretation and construction of the Standards. Interpretation and construction of a rule of procedure, like interpretation and construction of a statute, is a matter of law, which we review de novo, determining whether the court\u2019s interpretation and construction of the rule is correct. <em>See Associated Press v. Montana Senate Republican Caucus, </em>286 Mont. 172, 176, 951 P.2d 65, 67 (1997); <em>Faulconbridge v. State, </em>2006 MT 198, \u00b6\u00b6 24, 46-57, 333 Mont. 186, \u00b6\u00b6 24, 46-57, 142 P.3d 777, \u00b6\u00b6 24, 46-57; <em>Madrid v. Zenchiku Land and Livestock, </em>2002 MT 172, \u00b6 5, 310 Mont. 491, \u00b6 5, 51 P.3d 1137, \u00b6 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">Clarification of the Issue</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">\u00b623 At the outset, we note that Petitioners advance several theories of relief in addition to their arguments based on this Court\u2019s constitutional rulemaking authority. In particular, Petitioners renew their arguments under the Fifth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and Article II, Sections 17 and 22 of the Montana Constitution. In addition, Petitioners supplement their arguments by pointing out that heightened procedural safeguards are required in death penalty cases. <em>See Woodson v. North Carolina, </em>428 U.S. 280, 305, 96 S. Ct. 2978, 2991 (1976) (Opinion of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.) (\u201c[T]he penalty of death is qualitatively different from a sentence of imprisonment, however long. . . . Because of that qualitative difference, there is a corresponding difference in the need for reliability in the determination that death is the appropriate punishment in a specific case.\u201d); <em>see also Lankford v. Idaho, </em>500 U.S. 110, 125-26, 111 S. Ct. 1723, 1732 (1991); <em>Ring v. Arizona, </em>536 U.S. 584, 605-06, 122 S. Ct. 2428, 2441-42 (2002). We do not find it necessary, however, to decide this case on a \u201cdeath is different\u201d rationale or based on the foregoing constitutional provisions cited by Petitioners. Rather, we find this Court\u2019s rulemaking authority under Article VII, Section 2(3) of the Montana Constitution to be a sufficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>basis on which to resolve this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">\u00b624 Article VII, Section 2(3), provides that this Court \u201cmay make rules governing appellate procedure, <em>practice and procedure for all other courts, </em>admission to the bar and the conduct of its members\u201d (emphasis added). Article VII, Section 2(3), also states that \u201c[r]ules of procedure shall be subject to disapproval by the legislature in either of the two sessions following promulgation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">\u00b625 Pursuant to this constitutional rulemaking authority, and at the request of the Legislature and the Attorney General <em>(see </em>Laws of Montana, 1997, Ch. 378, \u00a7 7, at 1767), this Court on June 29, 1999, adopted the Standards, which became effective on January 1, 2000. The Standards specify a number of procedures concerning the appointment of counsel to represent indigent persons in death penalty cases at the trial and appellate levels and in state postconviction proceedings. They also set forth standards for competency of such counsel. The Standards have remained unchanged through the present, with the exception of Standard 1.1. (detailing the content and filing deadline of the prosecutor\u2019s notice of intent to seek the death penalty), which we amended on July 16, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">\u00b626 Standard I.1.a. (as amended July 16, 2002) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-7\">In any case in which death is a potential punishment, the prosecutor shall comply with Section 46-1-401, MCA, and shall file with the district court, within 60 days after arraignment, and serve upon counsel of record a notice stating whether the prosecutor intends to seek the death penalty upon a conviction in the case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">The State does not dispute Petitioners\u2019 contention that this provision, which was not disapproved by the Legislature in either of the two sessions following promulgation (i.e., in the 2003 or 2005 sessions), is a valid enactment pursuant to this Court\u2019s constitutional rulemaking authority. Indeed, the Attorney General\u2019s June 23, 1997 petition asking this Court to establish the Standards was explicitly premised on our authority under Article VII, Section 2(3). Likewise, it is uncontroverted that Standard I.1.a. is applicable to cause numbers DC 06-213B (Miller) and DC 06-212B (LeBrum), which are \u201ccase[s] in which death is a potential punishment.\u201d Thus, the validity and applicability of Standard I.l.a. are not at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-9\">\u00b627 However, conceding that the prosecutor filed his notice of intent to seek the death penalty upon Petitioners\u2019 convictions 72 days late, the State seeks to avoid Standard I.1.a.\u2019s time prescription-\u201cwithin 60 days after arraignment\u201d-on the ground that it is subject to exceptions. In particular, the State argues that \u201cPetitioners and their counsel were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>well aware, from the onset of the cases, that the death penalty was a potential punishment\u201d and that \u201c[t]he prosecutor\u2019s notice was filed sufficiently in advance of trial so that Petitioners will have a full opportunity to defend the case as a capital case.\u201d Thus, in the State\u2019s view, the District Court did not err in allowing the untimely notice of intent to stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-3\">\u00b628 The precise issues before us, therefore, are (1) whether the Standards contain an exception to Standard I.1.a.\u2019s 60-day deadline and (2)(a) if the Standards contain an exception, does it apply on the facts of this case or (b) if the Standards do not contain an exception, what are the consequences of a prosecutor\u2019s failure to file the required notice of intent in accordance with the 60-day deadline.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\">Whether the Standards Contain an Exception to Standard I.1.a.\u2019s 60-Dav Deadline</p>\n<p id=\"AiO\">\u00b629 We first observe that the State cites no textual support in the Standards for a \u201cno harm, no foul\u201d exception to the 60-day deadline. The only provision mentioned by the State is Section IV of the Standards; but Section IV merely provides that \u201c[n]o error or omission in the procedure outlined in the trial [Section I] or appellate [Section II] standards shall constitute a ground for relief from a conviction or sentence unless the defendant shows that the standards were not followed in a material way.\u201d Assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>this provision applies equally to grounds for relief presented in a petition for writ of supervisory control, filing the required notice of intent 72 days late clearly is a \u201cmaterial\u201d violation of Standard I.l.a. Thus, Section IV does not support the State\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">\u00b630 Alternatively, the State cites <em>State v. Lee, </em>917 P.2d 692 (Ariz. 1996), <em>State v. Jackson, </em>918 P.2d 1038 (Ariz. 1996), <em>State v. Shults, </em>2006 MT 100, 332 Mont. 130, 136 P.3d 507, and <em>United States v. Allen, </em>406 F.3d 940 (8th Cir. 2005), as authority for recognizing an exception to Standard I.l.a. (The District Court identified these same four cases as the basis for its decision.) Petitioners, for their part, cite <em>State v. Second Judicial Dist. Court, </em>11 P.3d 1209 (Nev. 2000), <em>State v. Luvene, </em>903 P.2d 960 (Wash. 1995), and <em>State </em>v. <em>Smallwood, </em>152 P.3d 821 (N.M. 2007), for the proposition that the 60-day deadline is firm. We commend the breadth of the parties\u2019 research; however, having fully considered the import of these cases, we find them materially distinguishable from the case at hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">\u00b631 Unlike Standard I.1.a., the timeliness rule at issue in <em>Lee </em>and <em>Jackson </em>specifies sanctions to be imposed by the trial court, in its discretion, if the prosecutor violates the rule, <em>see Lee, </em>917 P.2d at 698-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>99; <em>Jackson, </em>918 P.2d at 1042, and one such sanction is simply \u201cordering disclosure of the information not previously disclosed,\u201d <em>Lee, </em>917 P.2d at 698 (internal quotation marks omitted). Likewise, the timeliness rules at issue in <em>Second Judicial Dist. Court, Luvene, </em>and <em>Smallwood </em>explicitly permit the prosecutor\u2019s notice of intent to be filed late (in the trial court\u2019s discretion and if good cause is shown). <em>See Second Judicial Dist. Court, </em>11 P.3d at 1216; <em>Luvene, </em>903 P.2d at 973; <em>Smallwood, </em>152 P.3d at 825-26.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">\u00b632  The timeliness rule at issue in <em>Shults </em>is similarly distinguishable from Standard I.1.a. That rule permits the required notice to be filed late \u201cfor good cause shown.\u201d Section 46-13-108(1), MCA. Moreover, the rule is explicitly subject to an exception-namely, \u00a7 46-20-701(1), MCA, which states that \u201c[a] cause may not be reversed by reason of any error committed by the trial court against the convicted person <em>unless the record shows that the error was prejudicial\u201d </em>(emphasis added). In other words, while the Legislature provided that notice of the prosecutor\u2019s intent to seek treatment of the accused as a persistent felony offender \u201cmust be given at or before the omnibus hearing,\u201d \u00a7 46-13-108(1), MCA, and that such notice \u201cmust specify the alleged prior convictions,\u201d \u00a7 46-13-108(2), MCA, the Legislature also provided that a defendant claiming a violation of this rule must show that he or she was prejudiced by the violation, \u00a7 46-20-701(1), MCA. It was on this basis that we required a showing of prejudice in both <em>State v. McQuiston, </em>277 Mont. 397, 408-09, 922 P.2d 519, 526-27 (1996), and <em>Shults, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 22-23 (citing <em>McQuiston, </em>277 Mont. at 409, 922 P.2d at 527). Thus, contrary to the State\u2019s and the District Court\u2019s supposition, we did not read a no-prejudice exception into \u00a7 46-13-108, MCA, and <em>Shults </em>is not authority to do so in the present cases.</p>\n<p id=\"AJA\">\u00b633 Lastly, at issue in <em>Allen </em>was the Fifth Amendment requirement that at least one statutory aggravating factor and the mens rea requirement (which, if proved to the trial jury beyond a reasonable doubt, make the defendant eligible for the death penalty) must be found by the grand jury and charged in the indictment. <em>See Allen, </em>406 F.3d at 943. This notice requirement, however, is subject under existing federal precedents to harmless error analysis. <em>See Allen, </em>406 F.3d at 943-45. Thus, after concluding that Allen\u2019s indictment suffered a Fifth Amendment defect, the court proceeded to inquire whether this defect was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See Allen, </em>406 F.3d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>945-49.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> For these reasons, we conclude that <em>Allen, Shults, Lee, Jackson, Second Judicial Dist. Court, Luvene, </em>and <em>Smallwood </em>are inapposite for the purpose of interpreting Standard I.1.a.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-3\">\u00b634 Taking a slightly different approach, the State relies on <em>State v. Sol, </em>282 Mont. 69, 936 P.2d 307 (1997), and <em>Lankford v. Idaho, </em>500 U.S. 110, 111 S. Ct. 1723 (1991), for the proposition that Petitioners were entitled only to \u201cadequate\u201d notice of the possible imposition of a death sentence and the opportunity to present argument and evidence against such sentence, both of which the State maintains have been provided here. The District Court engaged in similar reasoning in denying Petitioners\u2019 motions, concluding that due process had been satisfied because Petitioners have advance notice of the prosecutor\u2019s intent to seek the death penalty such that they can prepare adequate defenses thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\">\u00b635 In so doing, however, the State and the District Court erroneously conflated two distinct claims advanced by Petitioners-namely, their constitutional due process claim and their claim based on Standard I.1.a.\u2019s mandate. These two claims are not coextensive. Even if constitutional due process does not require any more notice than Petitioners received here, Petitioners still may be entitled to relief based on the notice requirements established pursuant to this Court\u2019s constitutional rulemaking authority. <em>Cf. Smallwood, </em>152 P.3d at 825 (holding that Rule 5-704(A), NMRA, which was promulgated under the New Mexico Supreme Court\u2019s constitutional authority to exercise superintending control over all inferior courts and which requires the prosecutor\u2019s notice of intent to seek the death penalty to be filed within ninety days after arraignment unless good cause is shown, is not coextensive with a defendant\u2019s due process right to receive adequate notice of the State\u2019s intent to impose the death penalty).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">\u00b636 Turning, then, to the language of Standard I.1.a., the State would have this Court simply read an exception into the 60-day deadline. Relying specifically on <em>Lee, Jackson, Shults, </em>and <em>Allen, </em>the District Court adopted the State\u2019s suggestion, denying Petitioners\u2019 motions on the ground that \u201cthe State\u2019s failure to file the notice within the time prescribed by the Standard has not prejudiced the Defendant.\u201d The court noted that \u201cDefendant was aware of the possible imposition of the death penalty at the inception of this case,\u201d that \u201cDefendant has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>proceeded with the case as if the death penalty were a possible sentence,\u201d and that \u201cDefendant [now] has advance notice of the State\u2019s intent to seek the death penalty in order for the Defendant to prepare an adequate defense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">\u00b637 Petitioners respond that \u201c[n]othing in the Standards allow[ed] the district court to entertain whether-upon the State filing a late notice-a defendant has actually been prejudiced or whether the State had good cause for filing an untimely notice.\u201d They maintain that \u201cthe plain language of the Standards is clear and it [was] not the district court\u2019s role to insert analysis of prejudice and good cause\u201d into the rule. In a similar vein, Petitioners explain that they initially proceeded with their cases as if the death penalty was a possible sentence because the cases were, at that point, \u201cpotential\u201d capital cases, but once the 60-day deadline passed without the prosecutor\u2019s filing his notice of intent to seek the death penalty, they were \u201centitled to proceed as if their cases were not capital cases.\u201d They point out that Standard I.1.a.\u2019s 60-day deadline provides a time-certain date by which a defendant knows whether the case is an actual capital case. They contend, therefore, that the Standards did \u201cnot allow for the State to string Petitioners along for 72 days past the deadline, sitting in wait to know whether their cases are capital cases,\u201d and that they should not be required \u201cto assume even after a deadline has passed that a potential capital case may still [become an actual capital case].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">\u00b638 We agree with Petitioners that established rules of statutory construction do not permit the approach advocated by the State and followed by the District Court. In <em>State v. Kroll, </em>2004 MT 203, \u00b6 17, 322 Mont. 294, \u00b6 17, 95 P.3d 717, \u00b6 17, we stated that \u201c[w]here the plain language of the statute is clear and unambiguous, no further interpretation is required.\u201d Likewise, in <em>State ex rel. Palmer v. Hart, </em>201 Mont. 526, 530, 655 P.2d 965, 967 (1982), we stated that \u201c[w]here the language of the statute is plain, unambiguous, direct, and certain, the statute speaks for itself.\u201d And \u00a7 1-2-101, MCA, instructs that \u201c[i]n the construction of a statute, the office of the judge is simply to ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained therein, not to insert what has been omitted or to omit what has been inserted.\u201d We utilize these same rules when interpreting rules of court. <em>See Rich v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>2003 MT 51, \u00b6 11, 314 Mont. 338, \u00b6 11, 66 P.3d 274, \u00b6 11; <em>Busch v. Atkinson, </em>278 Mont. 478, 483-84, 925 P.2d 874, 877 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">\u00b639  Again, Standard I.1.a. states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-7\">In any case in which death is a potential punishment, the prosecutor shall comply with Section 46-1-401, MCA, and shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>file with the district court, within 60 days after arraignment, and serve upon counsel of record a notice stating whether the prosecutor intends to seek the death penalty upon a conviction in the case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-3\">By the express terms of this rule, the prosecutor \u201cshall\u201d-as opposed to \u201cmay\u201d or \u201cshould\u201d-file notice stating whether he or she intends to seek the death penalty upon a conviction within 60 days after the defendant\u2019s arraignment. In other words, the notice and timing requirements are mandatory, not discretionary or permissive. <em>See Redies v. Cosner, </em>2002 MT 86, \u00b6 19, 309 Mont. 315, \u00b6 19, 48 P.3d 697, \u00b6 19; <em>Gaustad v. City of Columbus, </em>265 Mont. 379, 381-82, 877 P.2d 470, 471 (1994). Most importantly, nothing in the plain language of the rule suggests that lack of prejudice to the defendant or the defendant\u2019s knowledge that the case is a potential death penalty case can supplant the express requirement that the notice be filed within the 60-day time frame.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\">\u00b640 It was the District Court\u2019s duty, as it is this Court\u2019s duty, to construe Standard I.l.a. \u201cas it is written,\u201d <em>Matter of the Estate of Magelssen, </em>182 Mont. 372, 378, 597 P.2d 90, 94 (1979), \u201cnot to insert what has been omitted,\u201d \u00a7 1-2-101, MCA. In this regard, Petitioners point out that the version of the Standards adopted by this Court on June 29, 1999, contained a Standard I.1.d., which provided as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A27\">If the prosecutor does not indicate a belief that the death penalty may be appropriate in a notice filed within 60 days after arraignment as provided by this standard, but later acquires evidence that, together with any other evidence, leads the prosecutor to conclude that sufficient evidence exists to establish, to the appropriate standard of proof, one or more of the statutory aggravating factors necessary to impose the death penalty upon a conviction in the case, the prosecutor may file the notice provided in this section, only with leave of the district court, <em>after consideration of the cause for the delay and any prejudice to the defendant. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">This Court deleted this exception to the 60-day deadline when we amended the Standards on July 16, 2002-a fact that fortifies Petitioners\u2019 argument and our conclusion that the Standards do not contemplate the exception to Standard I.l.a.\u2019s time prescription advocated by the State and read into the Standards by the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">\u00b641  We hold, therefore, that the District Court erred in concluding that Standard I.l.a.\u2019s 60-day deadline may be ignored if the defendant has not been prejudiced by the prosecutor\u2019s failure to abide by it. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>now consider the consequences of a prosecutor\u2019s failure to file the notice of intent in accordance with the time prescription.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">The Consequences of a Prosecutor\u2019s Failure to File the Notice of Intent in Accordance with Standard I.1.a.\u2019s 60-day Deadline</p>\n<p id=\"Aa0X\">\u00b642 Petitioners argue that failure to comply with Standard I. 1.a.\u2019s 60-day deadline \u201ccreates a jurisdictional defect precluding the State from seeking the death penalty and imposition of the death penalty as a sentence.\u201d They rely on a number of cases, including <em>State v. Madera, </em>206 Mont. 140, 155, 670 P.2d 552, 560 (1983) (characterizing the first persistent-felony-offender notice required by former \u00a7 46-18-503, MCA, as \u201cjurisdictional\u201d), <em>Matter of M.B., 282 </em>Mont. 150, 153, 935 P.2d 1129, 1130 (1997) (\u201c[A]n untimely notice of appeal is a jurisdictional defect, which renders this Court powerless to hear the appeal.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)), <em>Lemley v. Allen, </em>203 Mont. 37, 42-43, 659 P.2d 262, 266 (1983) (\u201c[T]he statute governing costs must be strictly followed, and a failure to serve a memorandum upon the adverse party deprives the district court of jurisdiction in the matter.\u201d), and <em>State v. 1978 LTD II, </em>216 Mont. 401, 402-03, 701 P.2d 1365, 1366 (1985) (the defective notice of seizure and intention to institute forfeiture proceedings \u201cdeprived the District Court of jurisdiction to enter default judgment\u201d). We disagree with Petitioner\u2019s use of the term \u201cjurisdictional\u201d in this context.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">\u00b643 It is important not to confuse categorical time prescriptions with jurisdictional provisions. <em>See, e.g.,Kontrick v. Ryan, </em>540 U.S. 443, 454, 455, 124 S. Ct. 906, 915 (2004) (observing that courts have been \u201cless than meticulous\u201d in their use of the term \u201cjurisdictional\u201d-e.g., by using the term to describe \u201cemphatic time prescriptions in rules of court\u201d-and that classifying time prescriptions, even rigid ones, under the heading \u201csubject matter jurisdiction\u201d can be \u201cconfounding\u201d); <em>DeShields v. State, </em>2006 MT 58, \u00b6 10, 331 Mont. 329, \u00b6 10, 132 P.3d 540, \u00b6 10 (observing that \u201c[\u00a1Jurisdiction is a word of many, too many, meanings\u201d and that we, along with other courts, sometimes have been \u201cprofligate\u201d in our use of the term (internal quotation marks omitted)). Subject-matter jurisdiction, we have explained, \u201cinvolves the fundamental power and authority of a court to determine and hear an issue.\u201d <em>Stanley v. Lemire, </em>2006 MT 304, \u00b6 30, 334 Mont. 489, \u00b6 30, 148 P.3d 643, \u00b6 30. Hence, a provision is properly characterized as \u201cjurisdictional\u201d if it \u201cdelineates] the classes of cases (subject-matter jurisdiction) . . . falling within a court\u2019s adjudicatory authority.\u201d <em>Kontrick, </em>540 U.S. at 455, 124 S. Ct. at 915.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">\u00b644 Categorical time prescriptions, by contrast, are \u201cinflexible\u201d or \u201crigid\u201d-but nonjurisdictional-claim-processing rules. <em>Kontrick, </em>540 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>U.S. at 454-55, 124 S. Ct. at 915; <em>Eberhart v. United States, </em>546 U.S. 12, 19, 126 S. Ct. 403, 407 (2005) (per curiam). Significantly, whereas subject-matter jurisdiction, because it involves the court\u2019s power to hear the case, can never be forfeited or waived, nor can it be conferred by the consent of a party, <em>In re Marriage of Miller, </em>259 Mont. 424, 427, 856 P.2d 1378, 1380 (1993); <em>Arbaugh v. Y &amp; H Corp., </em>546 U.S. 500, 514, 126 S. Ct. 1235, 1244 (2006), a claim-processing rule, \u201ceven if unalterable on a party\u2019s application, can nonetheless be forfeited if the party asserting the rule waits too long to raise the point,\u201d <em>Kontrick, </em>540 U.S. at 456, 124 S. Ct. at 916.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-3\">\u00b645 Applying these principles in the case at hand, we note that Standard I.l.a. does not speak in jurisdictional terms. It does not purport to delineate a class (i.e., the subject matter) of cases falling within the district courts\u2019 adjudicatory authority. More to the point, Standard I.l.a. does not purport to \u201cwithdraw\u201d the district courts\u2019 jurisdiction over death penalty cases <em>(see, e.g., Rockwell International Corp. v. United States, </em>127 S. Ct. 1397, 1405-06 (2007)). Nor could it. The subject-matter jurisdiction of the district courts is established by the Montana Constitution. In particular, Article VII, Section 4(1) provides, in relevant part, that district courts have \u201coriginal jurisdiction in all criminal cases amounting to felony.\u201d Although this Court has the authority, pursuant to Article VII, Section 2(3), to \u201cmake rules governing ... practice and procedure\u201d in the district courts-and Standard I.l.a. is such a rule-this authority does not enable us to withdraw the jurisdiction of the district courts 'as defined by Article VII, Section 4(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\">\u00b646 Accordingly, Standard I.1.a. is, necessarily, a categorical time prescription and not a jurisdictional provision. As such, a prosecutor\u2019s failure to comply with the 60-day deadline does not create \u201ca jurisdictional defect\u201d precluding the State from seeking the death penalty and precluding the district court from imposing the death penalty as a sentence. Rather, Standard I.l.a. simply \u201cassure[s] relief\u2019 to a defendant who properly raises it, but it does not compel the same result if the defendant forfeits it. <em>Eberhart, </em>546 U.S. at 19, 126 S. Ct. at 407. Stated differently, Standard I.1.a. is \u201cunalterable\u201d on a defendant\u2019s motion but can be forfeited if the defendant \u201cwaits too long to raise the point.\u201d <em>Eberhart, </em>546 U.S. at 15, 126 S. Ct. at 404 (internal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>quotation marks omitted).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">\u00b647  In the case at hand, Petitioners unquestionably did not \u201cwait[] too long to raise the point.\u201d As noted above, they were arraigned on July 18, 2006, and the prosecutor, therefore, had until September 18, 2006, to file notice stating whether he intended to seek the death penalty upon their convictions. That date passed without such notice being filed; in fact, the prosecutor filed his notice of intent 72 days late, on November 27, 2006. In the meantime, on November 8, 2006, Petitioners filed preemptive motions to preclude the State from seeking the death penalty and to preclude imposition of the death penalty as a sentence. And promptly upon the prosecutor\u2019s filing his notice of intent, Petitioners filed objections to and motions to strike the late filing. Under these circumstances, we hold that Petitioners properly and timely raised Standard I.l.a.\u2019s procedural safeguard and that their motions should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">\u00b648  The Standards do not contain an exception to Standard I.1.a.\u2019s 60-day deadline, which is a categorical, but nonjurisdictional, time prescription. Thus, where a prosecutor has failed to file notice, stating whether he or she intends to seek the death penalty upon a conviction in the case, in accordance with Standard I.l.a. and the defendant has timely raised this issue in a motion to preclude the State from seeking the death penalty and to preclude imposition of the death penalty as a sentence, that motion must be granted.

As the Ninth Circuit recently noted, however, the result would be no different if the defendant affirmatively waived the time prescription.. <em>See United States v.

It was not necessary for the prosecutor to have given the notice at all, for the entire purpose of the notice had already been fulfilled. Further, changes in constitutional law since adoption of the notice standard have left it with little practical effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">\u00b654 To demonstrate the purpose served by the 60-day notice provision, it is necessary to review this Court\u2019s adoption of the Standards for Competency of Counsel for Indigent Persons in Death Penalty Cases, of which this rule is a part. The brief filed in support of the Attorney General\u2019s original petition to this Court set forth the overall purpose for adoption of Standards:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-8\">A court order establishing competency standards will require district courts to identify and assign adequately trained and experienced lawyers to represent indigent capital clients.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-9\"><em>Brief of the Attorney General in Support of the Petition, </em>June 23, 1997, p. 8. Thus, the purpose of the Standards was to ensure that district courts would \u201cidentify and assign adequately trained and experienced\u201d defense counsel to an indigent defendant charged with a capital crime.</p>\n<p id=\"AJM\">\u00b655 Thereafter, on August 26, 1997, the Court submitted for comment an initial set of proposed Standards for Competency. In response, it was the State who suggested that a notification provision be added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ABF\">The State suggests that if standards are adopted, the Court should enact a requirement that the prosecutor notify the Court at the earliest reasonable opportunity if the prosecutor intends to treat the case as a potential death penalty case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-10\"><em>State\u2019s Comments on Proposed Standards, </em>December 23, 1997, p. 7. What was the purpose of this notice? As explained by the State, such a notice requirement \u201cis <em>intended only to provide a trigger </em>for the application of the other provisions of the standards.\u201d <em>State\u2019s Comments, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>p. 8 (emphasis added). \u201cThe intent of this requirement is simply to assist the trial court in <em>identifying the cases </em>in which the competency standards for counsel must be observed.\u201d <em>State\u2019s Comments, </em>p. 8 (emphasis added). Thus, the purpose of the notice was to alert the district court to those cases which would require appointment of counsel who met the capital competency standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">\u00b656 On December 30, 1997, the Court, citing the need for \u201cmore in-depth study and consideration,\u201d appointed a committee to consider the Standards further and to make written findings and recommendations. The Committee, reporting to the Court on October 29, 1998, recommended that the prosecutor file a notice of intention to seek the death penalty within 60 days after arraignment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The recommendations were submitted without commentary, but it was not contested by either the Majority or Minority of the Committee that \u201c[u]pon receipt of the notice, the court would appoint counsel under the substantive standards for trial level death penalty cases.\u201d <em>Minority Report, </em>November 2, 1998, p. 2. Thus, the notice provision was still intended to provide a trigger mechanism for appointment by the district court of counsel competent for representation in capital cases. This provision was adopted by the Court on June 29, 1999, which, I would note, was a year prior to the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Apprendi.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">\u00b657 Therefore, as originally intended and as adopted, and as the plain wording still provides today, Standard I.1.a requires a prosecutor to file a notice of intention to seek the death penalty within 60 days of arraignment. Likewise, Standard I.2 provides that, upon establishment of the defendant\u2019s indigency and upon giving of the prosecutor\u2019s notice (the \u201ctrigger\u201d mechanism), \u201cthe district court shall appoint two counsel to represent the defendant.\u201d Standard I.3 then provides the standards of competency which the two counsel must meet, and outlines the procedure for submission of information verifying counsel\u2019s competency to the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">\u00b658 However, in this case, the Defendants\u2019 attorneys and the District Court acted long before the procedure contemplated by the Standards played itself out. As noted by the District Court, the Information alleging the defendants had committed deliberate homicide was filed on July 11, 2006. The Information stated that a possible penalty upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>conviction was death. Six days later, on July 17, 2006, Defendant LeBrum\u2019s counsel, A1 Avignone, submitted information for purposes of demonstrating his possession of the minimum qualifications under the Standards of Competency. The same day, LeBrum\u2019s other counsel, John Hud, submitted his information. On July 25, 2006, both of Defendant Miller\u2019s counsel, Peter Ohman and Randi Hood, filed their respective Notices of Qualification for purposes of demonstrating their possession of qualifications to satisfy the Standards of Competency.</p>\n<p id=\"ACN\">\u00b659 On July 24, 2006, the District Court issued an order in LeBrum\u2019s case indicating that \u201calthough the prosecutor has not filed a notice stating that he intended to seek the death penalty,\u201d LeBrum \u201chad been advised\u201d by the Information and other statements that \u201cthe death penalty could be imposed upon a conviction,\u201d and therefore, the court was moving to appoint defense counsel who qualified under the Standards. <em>See Decision and Order, </em>January 9,2007, p. 3. After review of the filings of Avignone and Hud, the District Court concluded that both counsel met the Standards of Competency. On July 27,2006, the District Court entered a similar order with regard to the appointment of Ohman and Hood for Defendant Miller.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-3\">\u00b660 Thus, the District Court, prompted by the early filings of defense counsel, <em>sua sponte </em>\u201cpulled the trigger\u201d of Standard I.1.a by declaring that this was a death penalty case for which the Standards would apply \u2014 without further notice by the prosecutor. Then, it proceeded to fulfill Standards I.2 and I.3 by reviewing counsel\u2019s qualifications, approving the same, and appointing two attorneys to represent each defendant. The actions of the District Court thus rendered any further notice by the prosecutor completely moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\">\u00b661 As the Court correctly notes in its discussion of \u00b6\u00b6 38-40, it is this Court\u2019s duty to simply declare what the rule contains, nothing more, and to construe Standard I.l.a \u201cas it is written.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00b6 40. The Standard provides for nothing more than has already been accomplished. Although the Court holds that the Standard \u201cassure[s] relief\u2019 to a defendant who raises it, <em>see </em>\u00b6 46, the Court does not explain what that relief is-i.e., what more the Standards provided to the Defendants than they already received. The Court cannot explain this because there is simply no further \u201crelief\u2019 to be provided under the plain wording of the Standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">\u00b662 Defendants\u2019 due process arguments are without merit. Jumping in early, and rightfully so, defense counsel\u2019s capital case filings prompted the District Court to initiate the process under the Standards without any further notice from the prosecutor. Thus, all of the process under the Standards to which the Defendants were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>entitled was provided to them. Though probably filed as a panic reaction to the Defendants\u2019 assertions that a deadline was missed, the prosecutor\u2019s notice filing was moot and redundant, as the process it was designed to engender had already been completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">\u00b663 It is not necessary to reach the issue of whether there is an \u201cexception\u201d to the notice rule, nor is it necessary to reach the issue of whether the Defendants were prejudiced. Of course, they were not prejudiced, because they received from the District Court everything the Standards required them to receive.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">\u00b664 Finally, and perhaps most importantly, I offer a note about the 2002 amendment to Standard I.l.a, about which much has been made in the Petitioners\u2019 arguments, and the current status of the 60-day rule. The Court\u2019s 2002 amendment to the Standard deleted the provision for filing of a notice of intention to seek the death penalty after expiration of the 60-day period. As the amending order stated, the amendment was made in response to the Legislature\u2019s 2001 adoption of \u00a7 46-1-401, MCA, which required aggravating factors statutorily authorizing imposition of the death penalty to be alleged in the Information. Thus, a \u201clate\u201d filing of a notice of intention to seek the death penalty was no longer possible, as the crime would be designated a capital one at the time of the Information\u2019s filing, a fallout of the United States Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Apprendi </em>decision in 2000. That is exactly what happened here-the case was designated a capital one at the time of the Information\u2019s filing-which illustrates that the 60-day notice provision may hold little practical significance in the post<em>Apprendi </em>world. With the enactment of \u00a7 46-1-401, MCA, the filing of an Information which alleges aggravating factors becomes the practical \u201ctrigger\u201d for a district court\u2019s appointment of capital-qualified counsel. Indeed, it should be so, because capital-qualified counsel should be in place as early as possible. If the Information does not allege such factors, a prosecutor\u2019s notice, timely or not, cannot turn the case into a capital one. However, a filing of an amended Information in the case which alleges aggravating factors would do so, even if filed more than 60 days later. Consequently, the Standards for Competency remain valid, but the practical effect of the mechanism for triggering the appointment of qualified counsel has been altered by subsequent court decision and statutory enactment.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">\u00b665 I would not disturb the District Court\u2019s orders.</p>\n<judges id=\"b534-7\">JUSTICE WARNER joins the dissent of JUSTICE RICE.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b532-7\"> The Committee also recommended a provision for late filing of the notice \u201cupon consideration of the cause of the delay and any prejudice to the defendant,\u201d discussed hereinafter, which was also adopted by the Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
