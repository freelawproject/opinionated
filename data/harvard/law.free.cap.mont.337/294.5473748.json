The Bank was later dismissed pursuant to the stipulation of the parties. LHC, a concrete and gravel supplier, had supplied concrete to John Young, d/b/a D Bar J Logging, Inc., and D Bar J Asphalt (Young), a contractor employed by Alvarez to do paving work. Young failed to pay LHC the total due for the supplied material. LHC then filed a construction hen against Alvarez\u2019s property. Alvarez admitted that concrete supplied by LHC was used in the construction of its mini-storage facility, but disputed the dates and amount supplied, as well as the validity of the construction lien. After a bench trial, the District Court enforced the construction lien and awarded prejudgment interest as well as attorney fees and costs. Alvarez appeals from the judgment. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-12\">\u00b62 Alvarez raises four issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b321-13\">\u00b63 I. Did the court err when it considered deliveries outside of the timeline established in LHC\u2019s construction lien?</p>\n<p id=\"b321-14\">\u00b64 II. Did the court err in finding that LHC\u2019s concrete was delivered to Alvarez\u2019s mini-storage facility on August 11, 12 and 13?</p>\n<p id=\"b321-15\">\u00b65 III. Did the court err in awarding prejudgment interest?</p>\n<p id=\"b321-16\">\u00b66 IV. Did the court err in awarding attorney fees?</p>\n<p id=\"b321-17\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b321-18\">\u00b67 In 2003, Alvarez engaged Young to perform paving services in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>connection with the construction of a mini-storage facility. Young purchased concrete and other materials from LHC for use at the Alvarez property. At the time, Young had outstanding debts to LHC from past projects unrelated to the work he was doing for Alvarez.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">\u00b68 LHC delivered concrete to the Alvarez property from August 5 to 8,2003, as recorded in invoice 6521 (in the amount of $20,119). Invoice 24470 is for concrete delivered to the Alvarez property on August 14, 2003 (in the amount of $400.50). Invoice 6576 is, according to LHC\u2019s records, for delivery on August 11, 12, and 13, 2003 (in the amount of $3356.10). The fourth invoice, 6612, is for flowboys and water trucks delivered on July 29 and 30 and August 5, 7, and 8, 2003 (in the amount of $4,475).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">\u00b69 LHC did not maintain separate accounts for Young\u2019s different projects. At the time Young began purchasing materials for use on Alvarez\u2019s property, he had an outstanding balance of between $28,000 and $29,000 with LHC. When Young made payments to LHC, LHC applied those payments to Young\u2019s oldest outstanding invoices.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">\u00b610 Alvarez paid Young a total of about $60,000 for his work. On August 25, 2003, Young paid LHC $30,000. Only about $4,000 of this went to the Alvarez invoices. The rest went to other job invoices incurred prior to the Alvarez project. On October 9, 2003, Young paid LHC $10,000. LHC directed portions of this payment to invoices incurred by Young after the Alvarez project.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">\u00b611 On November 10,2003, LHC filed a construction lien on Alvarez\u2019s property. The lien stated that the balance remaining unpaid was $16,568, together with interest and costs. Additionally, the lien stated that the \u201cmaterials were first furnished on August 9, 2003, and were last furnished on August 14, 2003.\u201d On September 7, 2004, Alvarez filed a complaint against LHC. On October 1, 2004, LHC filed a separate claim against Alvarez. The two cases were consolidated. After a bench trial, the court found for LHC, granting judgment on the lien in the amount of $24,241.40, including $5,945 in attorney fees, $620 in costs, and $3,474.82 in prejudgment interest from the date of the filing of the lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">\u00b612 Alvarez appeals the District Court\u2019s enforcement of the lien as well as its grant of attorney fees and prejudgment interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-9\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b322-10\">\u00b613 We review conclusions of law, including statutory interpretation, <em>de novo. James Talcott Const. v. P &amp; D, </em>2006 MT 188, \u00b6 26, 333 Mont. 107, \u00b6 26, 141 P.3d 1200, \u00b6 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>\u00b614 We review findings of fact to determine whether the findings Eire clearly erroneous using a three-part test. First, we review the record to determine if the findings are supported by substantial evidence; second, if the findings are supported by substantial evidence, we will determine if the trial court has misapprehended the effect of the evidence; and third, if substantial evidence exists and the effect of the evidence has not been misapprehended, the Court may still conclude that a finding is clearly erroneous when a review of the record leaves the Court with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made. <em>James Talcott Const., </em>\u00b6 26 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">\u00b615 We review a district court\u2019s award of prejudgment interest <em>de novo. James Talcott Const., </em>\u00b6 28 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">\u00b616 We review a district court\u2019s order granting or denying attorney fees and costs to determine whether the court abused its discretion. <em>James Talcott Const., </em>\u00b6 27 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">\u00b617 I. Did the court err when it considered deliveries outside of the timeline established in LHC\u2019s construction lien?</p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">\u00b618 Alvarez contends that the court should not have granted judgment for deliveries made outside of the dates listed in LHC\u2019s construction lien. The lien states that it is for materials furnished between August 9 and August 14,2003. Section 71-3-535(3)(g)(i) and (ii), MCA, requires that a lien state the dates materials were furnished. Thus, according to Alvarez, the claimed lien should not be enforced for the amounts documented in invoice 6521 (August 5 to 8) and invoice 6612 (July 29 and 30 and August 5, 7 and 8), because these invoices are for delivery dates not stated in the lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-9\">\u00b619 The District Court, however, refused to consider this argument because Alvarez raised it for the first time in his post-trial findings of fact and conclusions of law. Alvarez disputes this and asserts that he argued the issue in his pretrial order by stating: \u201c[t]he LHC Lien was filed without right whatsoever.\u201d Similarly, Alvarez stated in the complaint that \u201c[t]he LHC lien is without right whatsoever.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b323-10\">\u00b620 It is well-established that we will not address issues on appeal that were not properly raised in the district court. <em>Nason v. Leistiko, </em>1998 MT 217, \u00b6 11, 290 Mont. 460, \u00b6 11, 963 P.2d 1279, \u00b6 11 (citations omitted). We concluded in <em>Marsh v. Overland, </em>and reaffirmed in <em>Nason, </em>that where a party fails to raise an issue in the pleadings, does not present argument on the issue during the hearing on the merits of the case, does not move to amend the pleadings to conform to any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>evidence presented and raises the issue for the first time in a post-hearing memorandum that the district court does not address in its order, the issue has not been timely raised and may not be raised on appeal. <em>Nason, </em>\u00b6 18 (citing <em>Marsh v. Overland, </em>274 Mont. 21, 29, 905 P.2d 1088, 1093 (1995)).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">\u00b621 Here, Avarez\u2019s general assertion, in his complaint and in the pretrial order, that the lien was filed \u201cwithout right whatsoever,\u201d failed to specifically raise the argument that delivery dates not listed in the lien should not be enforced. Other than his general statement that the lien was without right, Avarez did not raise the issue in the pleadings, did not amend the pleadings to include the issue, and did not raise the issue at trial. Finally, the District Court refused to consider Avarez\u2019s argument. As Avarez failed to timely raise the issue in the district court, we decline to address it on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">\u00b622 II. Did the court err in finding that LHC\u2019s concrete was delivered to Avarez\u2019s mini-storage facility on August 11, 12 and 13?</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">\u00b623 Avarez also argues that LHC failed to prove that concrete was delivered to Avarez\u2019s property on August 11,12 and 13, as claimed in the lien. LHC\u2019s sole evidence that delivery occurred on these dates was invoice 6576 and the corresponding scale tickets. Only one employee, Carol Phillips, LHC\u2019s controller, testified regarding invoice 6576. She testified that she did not know who provided the information on the invoice and scale tickets, in particular the dates and the location. She further testified that the material was not hauled by an LHC truck, that she did not know who hauled the material and that she had no independent knowledge of where the material was delivered, other than what was written on the invoice and scale tickets. Finally, Avarez testified that no materials were delivered after August 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">\u00b624 Avarez is correct that \u00a7 71-3-524, MCA, requires that materials be supplied with the intent that they be incorporated into an improvement on the property to which the lien attaches and that the materials actually are incorporated into the improvement. Further, the delivery of materials to the site of the improvement, whether by the lien claimant or another, creates a presumption that the materials were incorporated. Section 71-3-524(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">\u00b625 Here, based on invoice 6576 and the corresponding scale tickets, which were submitted without objection and explained by Phillips, the District Court determined that materials were delivered, on August 11, 12 and 13, to Avarez\u2019s property and subsequently used in the construction of the mini-storage facility. Despite Avarez\u2019s contention <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>otherwise, the evidence presented to the court was substantial. Once a proper foundation has been laid, a court may rely on business records as evidence that an event took place. Here, Alvarez did not object to the admission of the invoice or scale tickets and admitted that the proper foundation was laid. Both the invoice and scale tickets state that on August 11,12 and 13, asphalt was delivered to \u201cASHRD STG.\u201d As Alvarez\u2019s mini-storage facility is located on Ash Road, these documents indicate that materials were delivered to Alvarez\u2019s property on August 11, 12 and 13. The District Court\u2019s corresponding determination was thus not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">\u00b626 III. Did the court err in awarding prejudgment interest?</p>\n<p id=\"Afb\">\u00b627 Alvarez argues that prejudgment interest is not appropriate under \u00a7 27-1-211, MCA, because the court rejected LHC\u2019s accounting and reduced the lien from $16,568 to $14,201.58. Thus, according to Alvarez, the amount was not certain.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">\u00b628 Section 27-1-211, MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-6\">Every person who is entitled to recover damages certain or capable of being made certain by calculation and the right to recover [is vested] upon a particular day is entitled also to recover interest thereon from that day ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">\u00b629  The three criteria which must be satisfied for an award of prejudgment interest are: (1) an underlying monetary obligation; (2) the amount of recovery must be certain or capable of being made certain by calculation; and (3) the right to recover must vest on a particular day. <em>James Talcott Const., </em>\u00b6 40. However, \u201cthe fact that a claim is disputed does not make it uncertain,\u201d as long as the damage amount is reduced to certainty on a particular day. <em>Safeco Ins. Co. v. Lovely Agency, </em>215 Mont. 420, 425, 697 P.2d 1354, 1357 (1985) (citations omitted). Additionally, the proper accrual date for the calculation of interest on a construction lien is the date the lien is filed. <em>James Talcott Const., </em>\u00b6 39 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">\u00b630 Here, the underlying monetary obligation was the balance remaining for materials provided to Alvarez\u2019s property. LHC\u2019s calculations differed from the court\u2019s regarding the $10,000 payment made by Young on October 9, 2003. LHC credited a portion of the $10,000 to invoices incurred by Young while working on projects undertaken subsequent to the Alvarez project. The court, however, found that LHC\u2019s accounting was \u201ccontrary to its stated accounting practice,\u201d and therefore applied the full $10,000 to the Alvarez account. Consequently, the court determined that the balance remaining for materials provided to Alvarez\u2019s property was $14,201.58, less than the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>amount calculated by LHC.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">\u00b631  While the court\u2019s conclusion differed from the original figure listed by LHC in its lien, the amount was still capable of being made certain by calculation. Further, the right to recover vested on November 10, 2003, when the lien was filed. Thus, the court correctly awarded prejudgment interest pursuant to \u00a7 27-1-211, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">\u00b632 IV. Did the court err in awarding attorney fees?</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">\u00b633 Avarez does not dispute the court\u2019s authority to award attorney fees for the enforcement of a construction lien. Instead, Avarez contends that LHC should only recover attorney fees in proportion to the percentage of its claimed lien that the court enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">\u00b634 LHC responds that the court properly awarded attorney fees because \u00a7 71-3-124(1), MCA, provides for the award of attorney fees in an action to foreclose a lien. Additionally, LHC provided the court with an affidavit in support of the reasonableness of its attorney fees. Avarez, however, replies that \u00a7 71-3-124(1), MCA, only allows attorney fees for a claimant \u201cwhose lien is established.\u201d As the court found that $14,201.58 was due, as opposed to the $16,568 claimed in LHC\u2019s lien, LHC, according to Avarez, should only receive 86 percent of its attorney fees, in proportion to the ratio of LHC\u2019s success to the amount claimed in the lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">\u00b635  \u201cThe fact that [the claimant] did not receive the entire amount of his claim does not alter\u201d the award of attorney fees mandated by \u00a7 71-3-124, MCA. <em>Donnes v. Orlando, </em>221 Mont. 356, 362, 720 P.2d 233, 237 (1986). While \u00a7 71-3-124, MCA, does require a claimant\u2019s lien be established in order for attorney fees to be awarded, and, in fact, awards attorney fees to a defendant where a lien is not established, the statute does not require a proportional reduction in attorney fees where judgment is for a lesser amount than was claimed in the lien. The District Court thus did not abuse its discretion in awarding attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-9\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b326-10\">\u00b636 We uphold the District Court\u2019s enforcement of LHC\u2019s construction lien against Avarez\u2019s property as well as its award of prejudgment interest and attorney fees and costs.</p>\n<judges id=\"b326-11\">JUSTICES COTTER, MORRIS and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b326-12\">JUSTICE NELSON</author>\n<p id=\"Auq\">concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-13\">\u00b637 I reluctantly concur in the Court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-14\">\u00b638 As the Court notes in \u00b6 18 of the Opinion, the lien states that the materials were furnished between August 9 and August 14,2003. Two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>invoices admitted in evidence indisputably cover materials and services outside the times claimed in the lien. Specifically, invoice 6521, in the amount of $20,119.00, is for concrete delivered from August 5 to August 8, and invoice 6612, in the amount of $4,475.00, is for flowboys and water trucks delivered on July 29 and 30 and August 5, 7, and 8. Facially, these two invoices are for materials and services delivered prior to the times covered by the lien. The lien is, therefore, deficient on its face under \u00a7 71-3-535(3)(g)(i) and (ii), MCA. Unfortunately, because Alvarez did not properly raise this argument in the District Court, that court was and this now Court is in the position of having to enforce a facially deficient construction lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">\u00b639 For this reason, I would specifically limit our decision to the facts of this case. To that extent, I concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
