We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">\u00b62 We review whether the District Court erred in granting State Farm\u2019s motion for summary judgment?</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">\u00b63 Shelton and her husband, Kenneth Shelton, were injured in an automobile accident in Missoula in early April of1995. Tim Hazelbaker (Hazelbaker) \u201crear-ended\u201d their car with his pickup. Hazelbaker conceded liability, and his insurer paid $25,000.00 each to Shelton and her husband in August of 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-9\">\u00b64 Shelton and her husband also made claims on several State Farm policies under which they were insured for medical payments and underinsured motorist (UIM) coverage. Shelton\u2019s husband settled his UIM claim for $60,000.00 in April of 1998. Shelton and State Farm would not settle her UIM claim for another three years.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-10\">\u00b65 Shelton first offered to settle her UIM claim with State Farm in May of 1998 for $90,000.00 in excess of advances that she already had received for her medical costs. Her offer exceeded what State Farm thought she was entitled under her UIM coverage. State Farm hired Attorney Terry J. MacDonald (MacDonald) to \u201cevaluate the claim process to date and handle future negotiations with Mrs. Shelton.\u201d State Farm rejected Shelton\u2019s settlement offer after consulting with MacDonald. State Farm chose instead to \u201cproceed with additional discovery in the claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b405-11\">\u00b66 Shelton filed a complaint against State Farm on April 29, 1999, seeking to recover UIM benefits in an amount equal to the special and general damages that she had sustained in the accident. The parties attempted unsuccessfully to mediate Shelton\u2019s claim in \u201cearly summer of 1999.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b405-12\">\u00b67 Shelton amended her complaint on August 13,1999, to add claims for punitive damages and bad faith. Shelton alleged in her bad faith claim that State Farm had violated two provisions of the Montana Unfair Trade Practices Act (MUTPA) when it (1) refused to pay her claims without conducting a reasonable investigation as required by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>\u00a7 33-18-201(4), MCA, and (2) neglected to attempt in good faith to effectuate a prompt, fair, and equitable settlement of her claim even though liability had become reasonably clear, as required by \u00a7 33-18-201(6), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">\u00b68 Shelton sent her \u201cFirst Discovery Requests\u201d regarding her MUTPA, UIM coverage, and punitive damages claims to State Farm in August of 1999. State Farm responded on August 16,1999, with an \u201cOffer of Judgment,\u201d pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 68. State Farm\u2019s offer stated that it would allow \u201cjudgment to be taken against it on all of the claims\u201d if Shelton would accept a payment of $57,038.28. Shelton refused State Farm\u2019s offer. State Farm then sent her a check on September 8, 1999, for $57,038.28 with no demand that she release State Farm from liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">\u00b69 The parties stipulated to bifurcate Shelton\u2019s UIM coverage claim from her punitive damages and MUTPA claims. They also agreed to hold in abeyance Shelton\u2019s discovery requests on her punitive damages and MUTPA claims pending a resolution of Shelton\u2019s UIM claim. The parties settled the UIM claim on May 7, 2001, for $23,000.00 in addition to what State Farm already had paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">\u00b610 Thereafter Shelton and State Farm engaged in a protracted discovery dispute regarding Shelton\u2019s MUTPA and punitive damages claims. State Farm stated in its response to Shelton\u2019s discovery requests that it \u201cobjected to providing information it considered confidential, proprietary business materials, and suggested the parties agree to a protective order which would allow [Shelton] to use the materials while maintaining the confidential nature of the documents.\u201d Shelton argues that she \u201cdeclined to stipulate to what she saw as an unwarranted protective order.\u201d Shelton points out that State Farm admitted that it had the materials that she requested and State Farm never moved for a protective order.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">\u00b611 State Farm filed an answer to Shelton\u2019s amended complaint on March 11, 2002. It asserted, pursuant to \u00a7 33-18-242(5), MCA, that \u201c[a]n insurer may not be held liable under this section if the insurer had a reasonable basis in law or in fact for contesting the claim or the amount of the claim, whichever is in issue.\u201d State Farm then filed a motion for summary judgment on March 12,2004, regarding Shelton\u2019s MUTPA and punitive damages claims. Shelton filed a motion to compel on October 25, 2004, for various interrogatories and requests for production of documents to which, she claimed, State Farm had responded only \u201cfractionally.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b407-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>\u00b612 The court held a hearing regarding both motions on July 5,2005. The court adopted State Farm\u2019s proposed twenty-seven-page order <em>\u201cin toto\u201d </em>on January 23, 2006, granting State Farm\u2019s motion for summary judgment as to Ml Shelton\u2019s claims and denying Shelton\u2019s motion to compel discovery. The court\u2019s order stated, with respect to Shelton\u2019s MUTPA claims, that she had \u201cnot met her burden to come forward with proper verification of the existence of any material fact which would preclude granting State Farm\u2019s motion.\u201d It noted with respect to her punitive damages claims that \u201cSheltonG admitted that [she] had no factual basis for a claim of actual malice, and there is absolutely no evidence of any fraudulent behavior of any type by State Farm....\u201d The court also denied her motion to compel discovery. It determined that Shelton\u2019s \u201c[m]otion is more accurately described as a Rule 56(f) motion .... to hold a summary judgment motion in abeyance because she cannot overcome summary judgment without conducting further discovery.\u201d The court concluded that \u201c[n]one of the documentation sought by [Shelton] through her Motion to Compel would preclude entry of summary judgment, and so it is not well-taken.\u201d Shelton appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">\u00b613 We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s decision to grant summary judgment, using the same criteria applied by the district court under M. R. Civ. P. 56. <em>GRB Farm v. Christman Ranch, </em>Inc., 2005 MT 59, \u00b6 7, 326 Mont. 236, \u00b6 7, 108 P.3d 507, \u00b6 7. Summary judgment is appropriate when \u201cthe pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d M. R. Civ. P. 56(c). We draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the party opposing summary judgment. <em>Watkins Trust v. Lacosta, </em>2004 MT 144, \u00b6 16, 321 Mont. 432, \u00b6 16, 92 P.3d 620, \u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">\u00b614 <em>Did the district court err in granting State Farm\u2019s motion for summary judgment ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">\u00b615 Shelton argues first that she has established a genuine issue of material fact as to whether State Farm conducted a \u201creasonable investigation\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 33-18-201(4), MCA. She points out that her answers to State Farm\u2019s interrogatories provide that (1) State Farm failed to collect several years of Shelton\u2019s pre-injury medical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>records, even though State Farm admitted that it reasonably needed these records in order to investigate her claim properly; (2) State Farm failed to pursue reports from a medical doctor and a physicist until 1999, even though State Farm admitted that it reasonably would require these reports in order to evaluate Shelton\u2019s claim; and (3) State Farm \u201ctainted the physics aspect of its investigation\u201d when it \u201cdelayed providing its own doctor\u2019s findings and conclusions\u201d to the physicist that State Farm hired to testify about the cause of Shelton\u2019s injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"Aea\">\u00b616 State Farm argues that Shelton has failed to establish any issue of fact as to whether there was a \u201creasonable investigation\u201d in light of the fact that (1) Shelton admitted in a deposition that she was \u201cunclear on what investigations she believes State Farm should have undertaken;\u201d and (2) State Farm\u2019s outside counsel stated that he found State Farm\u2019s investigation to be \u201cthorough and appropriate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">\u00b617 Shelton\u2019s inability to advise State Farm on its claims handling practices does not change the fact that she has offered evidence tending to show that State Farm failed to collect records and reports and failed to share important information among its own experts. MacDonald\u2019s contrary assertions that the investigation was \u201cthorough and appropriate\u201d tend to establish only that he disagrees with Shelton. Moreover, State Farm confirms Shelton\u2019s evidence-to some extent-when it admits that there was a \u201cdelay (of a few weeks)\u201d in the seeking of her medical records. State Farm has failed to establish an absence of genuine issues of material fact as to whether State Farm \u201creasonably investigated\u201d her claim pursuant to \u00a7 33-18-201(4), MCA. M. R. Civ. P. 56(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">\u00b618 Shelton argues next that she has created an issue of fact with regard to whether State Farm neglected \u201cto attempt in good faith to effectuate [a] prompt, fair, and equitable settlement[] of claims in which liability has become reasonably clear,\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 33-18-201(6), MCA. She contends that her evidence that State Farm failed to perform a \u201creasonable investigation,\u201d as described above at \u00b6 15, also tends to establish that State Farm acted in bad faith during the settlement negotiations. She also offers evidence that State Farm neglected for years to offer even the bottom end of its own evaluation range.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">\u00b619 Shelton admits that she was unwilling to settle before the spring of 1998 in light of her pending shoulder surgery, but claims that State Farm failed to make a good faith effort thereafter. She states in her interrogatory that \u201c[although [State Farm\u2019s] claims adjuster requested $72,500 of settlement authority [sometime near May of 1998], [State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>Farm\u2019s] claims manager in charge of the claims adjuster authorized only $40,000 of settlement authority.\u201d Shelton also asserts that State Farm \u201cwithheld important medical information from [her] ....\u201d She states in her interrogatory that State Farm failed to forward to her a \u201cletter dated December 12, 1997 from [her] physical therapist ... [opining] that [Shelton] had [a] permanent disability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\">\u00b620 State Farm offers some conflicting evidence, but fails to establish the absence of a genuine issue as to any material fact regarding Shelton\u2019s claim under \u00a7 33-18-201(6), MCA. State Farm instead attacks Shelton\u2019s proffered evidence as being based almost exclusively on her own answers to State Farm\u2019s interrogatories. State Farm\u2019s argument lacks merit as M. R. Civ. P. 56(c) specifically provides for the court\u2019s use of \u201canswers to interrogatories\u201d when considering a motion for summary judgment. Shelton\u2019s reliance on her own answers to State Farm\u2019s interrogatory is no less valid than State Farm\u2019s reliance on the affidavits that it submitted from its own attorney and claims adjusters. <em>See </em>M. R. Civ. P. 56(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">\u00b621 State Farm also argues that \u201cvirtually all of the concerns raised by Shelton in regard to the claim handling occurred during the litigation of the underlying matter.\u201d It cites <em>Palmer by Diacon v. Farmers Ins., </em>261 Mont. 91, 121-22, 861 P.2d 895, 914-15 (1993), for the proposition that an insurer\u2019s litigation conduct should not be considered as evidence of bad faith. State Farm overstates this Court\u2019s holding in <em>Palmer.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">\u00b622 This Court in <em>Palmer </em>reversed a trial court\u2019s decision to allow evidence of an insurer\u2019s litigation conduct from a trial on whether the insurer had breached the covenant of good faith and fair dealing. <em>Palmer, </em>261 Mont. at 125, 861 P.2d at 916. The Court determined that the prejudicial nature of the insurer\u2019s litigation conduct outweighed its relevance at a trial. <em>Palmer, </em>261 Mont. at 124, 861 P.2d at 916. This Court specifically noted that \u201cwe do not impose a blanket prohibition\u201d on an insurer\u2019s post-filing conduct. <em>Palmer, </em>261 Mont. at 123, 861 P.2d at 915. The Court held that the correct approach would be to weigh the prejudicial effect of such evidence against its probative value pursuant to M. R. Evid. 403. <em>Palmer, </em>261 Mont. at 123, 861 P.2d at 915.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">\u00b623 Moreover, Shelton did not file suit against State Farm until April of 1999, approximately one year after her first demand for settlement. State Farm\u2019s conduct within this period would be admissible even under State Farm\u2019s broad interpretation of this Court\u2019s holding in <em>Palmer. </em>State Farm fails to establish an absence of a genuine issue as to whether it made a \u201cgood faith\u201d attempt at a settlement with Shelton <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>during the three years between Shelton\u2019s first demand for settlement in May of 1998 and the parties\u2019 final settlement of Shelton\u2019s UIM claims in May of 2001. M. R. Civ. P. 56(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">\u00b624 Shelton contests finally the court\u2019s determination that no genuine issues of material fact exist with respect to whether \u201cany State Farm employee or agent acted with actual malice in the handling of Shelton\u2019s claim.\u201d Shelton\u2019s claim of actual malice requires her to offer evidence tending to show that State Farm had knowledge of facts or intentionally disregarded facts that created a high probability of injury to Shelton. Section 27-1-221(2), MCA. She offers evidence that State Farm knew \u201cfor years [that] it held funds rightly belonging to Shelton.\u201d Shelton points out that she had a high probability of injury in light of the fact that \u00a7 27-1-106, MCA, defines an \u201cinjury to property\u201d as \u201cdepriving its owner of the benefit of it, which is done by ... withholding ... it ....\u201d She also must offer facts tending to show that State Farm proceeded with conscious, intentional disregard, or indifference to a high probability of injury to Shelton. Section 27-1-221(2), MCA. She recounts in her interrogatory that State Farm refused to pay her UIM benefits less than or equal to the minimum amount that State Farm\u2019s internal evaluations showed that she deserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">\u00b625 State Farm responds that Shelton has admitted that State Farm acted without malice. It points to statements in her deposition testimony where it alleges that Shelton admits that she and State Farm had an \u201chonest disagreement on the value of [her] personal injury case.\u201d State Farm also points to Shelton\u2019s testimony where it alleges she failed to \u201carticulate any reason for her claims.\u201d State Farm asked Shelton, for example, if she thought that \u201canyone working for or on behalf of State Farm set out purposely to hurt you or recklessly to cause you damage, or was this an honest disagreement?\u201d Shelton responded: \u201cI don\u2019t know. I would hope they wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">\u00b626 Shelton\u2019s alleged admission that she and State Farm had an \u201chonest disagreement\u201d on the total value of the settlement fails to show that she offered no genuine issue of fact as to whether State Farm acted with malice. An issue could exist as to whether State Farm acted with malice in failing to pay Shelton the minimum amount of money it had determined that she deserved, even if State Farm could prove that the parties \u201chonestly disagreed\u201d over the total value of the settlement. State Farm\u2019s remaining citations to her deposition testimony represent either unresponsive or irrelevant answers to the issue of whether State Farm acted with actual malice.</p>\n<p id=\"AX0\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>\u00b627 The District Court also determined that Shelton had failed to establish an issue of fact with respect to State Farm\u2019s affirmative defense under the MUTPA that it had a reasonable basis for contesting the value of her claim. Section 33-18-242(5), MCA, provides that \u201c[a]n insurer may not be held liable under this section if the insurer had a reasonable basis in law or in fact for contesting the claim or the amount of the claim, whichever is in issue.\u201d The record indicates, however, as we discussed above at \u00b6 26, that Shelton has offered interrogatory answers tending to show that State Farm had no reasonable basis for refusing to pay \u201ceven the bottom end of its own under-evaluation.\u201d State Farm makes no showing that this issue of fact is either absent or irrelevant to its defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\">\u00b628  We conclude that the District Court erred in determining that Shelton has failed to present genuine issues of material fact with respect to her MUTPA and punitive damages claims. Our decision on the court\u2019s summary judgment motion renders our consideration of Shelton\u2019s motion to compel unnecessary in light of the fact that the court analyzed her motion to compel discovery as an M. R. Civ. P. 56(f) motion to postpone summary judgment so that Shelton could seek discovery on \u201cfacts essential to justify [her] opposition ...\u201d to summary judgment. Shelton no longer needs to postpone summary judgment. The court should reconsider her motion on remand as a motion to compel discovery pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">\u00b629 We REVERSE the District Court\u2019s order for summary judgment and REMAND for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b411-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES LEAPHART, WARNER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
