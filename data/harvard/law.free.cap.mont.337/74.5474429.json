We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-9\">\u00b62 We restate the issues as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b101-10\">\u00b63 I. Did the District Court err in concluding that the second search warrant was valid because it was based on a source independent of the first, unconstitutional search?</p>\n<p id=\"b101-11\">\u00b64 II. Did the District Court give sufficient unanimity jury instructions for Counts III and IV?</p>\n<p id=\"b101-12\">\u00b65 III. Were the second or subsequent prostitution counts (Counts VI, XII, XTV) properly charged as felonies?</p>\n<p id=\"b101-13\">\u00b66 IV. Did the District Court prevent Dasen from presenting a \u201cmistake of age\u201d defense to the jury?</p>\n<p id=\"b101-14\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b101-15\">\u00b67 Dasen was arrested on February 24, 2004, and charged -with sexual intercourse without consent. Dasen pled not guilty. During pretrial proceedings, the State twice amended the information to add additional charges against Dasen. The third, and final, amended information charged the following counts: (I) sexual intercourse without consent; (II) aggravated promotion of prostitution; (III) promotion of prostitution; (IV) sexual abuse of children; (V) misdemeanor prostitution; (VI) through (XIV) felony prostitution (each count against separate, named victims).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-16\">\u00b68 Following an eighteen-day trial and over ten hours of deliberation, the jury convicted Dasen of Counts III, IV, V, VI, XII, XIV. The District Court imposed a two-year sentence without the possibility of parole for Count XTV as well an eighteen-year suspended sentence for the remaining counts. The court also imposed a fine of $11,350 and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>restitution of $1,125. Dasen subsequently filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">\u00b69 Additional, issue specific facts are set out below.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">\u00b610 I. Did the District Court err in concluding that the second search warrant was valid because it was based on a source independent of the first, unconstitutional search?</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">\u00b611 A. Applicable Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">\u00b612 On February 11, 2004, the State applied for search warrants for Dasen\u2019s residence and two businesses in which Dasen had an interest. After finding that probable cause existed, Judge Stadler issued three search warrants. Although the applications particularly described the items to be seized, the warrants themselves did not. When the warrants were served, the officers did not present the warrant applications. Accordingly, neither the warrants nor any accompanying documents particularly described the items to be seized. Two weeks later the United States Supreme Court held, in <em>Groh v. Ramirez, </em>540 U.S. 551, 124 S. Ct. 1284 (2004), that if the application is not served with the warrant, the warrant itself must particularly describe the items to be seized.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-9\">\u00b613 Two days after <em>Groh </em>was decided, one of Dasen\u2019s businesses filed a motion requesting that the court order the seized property returned in light of <em>Groh. </em>Following a show cause hearing on March 2, 2004, the court ordered all items returned. Later that same day and the next, the State submitted a second round of warrant applications to the court administrator. Although Judge Stadler was the presiding judge, the applications were reviewed and approved by Judge Curtis, a fellow Eleventh Judicial District Court Judge. Judge Stadler, anticipating a second warrant application in light of the original warrant\u2019s invalidity, had requested that the court administrator submit any new applications to one of the other district court judges \u201cto insure and guarantee an independent review.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b102-10\">\u00b614 The State returned the previously seized items and re-seized them pursuant to the second, facially valid search warrant which particularly described the items to be seized. Dasen, however, in a motion to suppress, argued that the second search warrant was invalid because it was fruit of the poisonous tree-that is, it was a product of the first, invalid search. Dasen also contended that Judge Curtis had no jurisdiction to approve the warrant because she had previously been substituted at Dasen\u2019s request pursuant to \u00a7 3-1-804, MCA. Judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>Stadler disagreed, concluding that the evidence necessary to show probable cause for the second warrant was obtained from a source independent of the first search and thus met an exception to the exclusionary rule. Dasen appeals the denial of his motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"AeH\">\u00b615 B. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\">\u00b616 We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress to assess whether there is substantial credible evidence to support the court\u2019s findings of fact, and whether those findings were correctly applied as a matter of law. <em>State v. Therriault, </em>2000 MT 286, \u00b6 24, 302 Mont. 189, \u00b6 24, 14 P.3d 444, \u00b6 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">\u00b617 C. Was the second warrant based on information from an independent source?</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">\u00b618 Dasen argues that it is not possible that the second search warrant was independent from the first, because the taint of the first search could not be \u201cpurged.\u201d The State held and analyzed the property for almost one month before returning it, only to immediately re-seize the property under the second search warrant. Further, the State concealed its plans from Judge Stadler and Dasen. Finally, Dasen contends that even if the second search was valid under federal law, the \u201chighly irregular circumstances\u201d do not pass constitutional muster under Montana\u2019s stronger right to privacy. According to Dasen, all items seized in the second search constitute \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree\u201d and must be suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">\u00b619 The \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree\u201d doctrine forbids the use of evidence which comes to light as a result of the exploitation of an initial illegal act of the police. <em>Therriault, </em>\u00b6 57. However, following federal case law, we have set forth three exceptions to this doctrine. The evidence is admissible if it is (1) attenuated from the constitutional violation so as to remove its primary taint; (2) obtained from an independent source; or (3) determined to be evidence which would have been inevitably discovered apart from the constitutional violation. <em>Therriault, </em>\u00b6 58.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">\u00b620 The United States Supreme Court analyzed the independent source doctrine in the context of a second search pursuant to a warrant that was preceded by an initial, unlawful search in <em>Murray v. U.S., </em>487 U.S. 533, 108 S. Ct. 2529 (1988). The defendant argued, as does Dasen, that the independent source exception should not apply to the second search. <em>Murray, </em>487 U.S. at 537, 108 S. Ct. at 2533. The Court, however, concluded \u201cif that later acquisition was not the result of the earlier entry there is no reason why the independent source doctrine should not apply.\u201d Invoking the exclusionary rule would put the police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>not in the same position, as federal and Montana case law require, but in a worse position. <em>Murray, </em>487 U.S. at 541, 108 S. Ct. at 2535 (citations omitted); <em>see also Therriault, </em>\u00b6 57. \u201cThe ultimate question, therefore, is whether the search pursuant to warrant was in fact a genuinely independent source of the information and tangible evidence at issue ....\u201d <em>Murray, 487 </em>U.S. at 542, 108 S. Ct. at 2536. The Court does note, however, that genuine independence \u201cmay well be difficult to establish where the seized goods are kept in the police\u2019s possession.\u201d <em>Murray, </em>487 U.S. at 542, 108 S. Ct. at 2535.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">\u00b621 Here, the information provided to secure the second warrant was information the State obtained prior to the first search warrant, as well as information obtained from additional sources not connected to or derived from the first search. The State submitted the same information used to secure the first search warrant, which was obviously obtained without the information gained in the first search. Further, the few new pieces of information submitted were independently obtained as well, such as details provided by one of the victim\u2019s grandmother, and information concerning a wire transfer known to the State prior to the first search. Finally, while the first search was a factor in obtaining the second search warrant, in that the invalidity of the first search necessitated a second warrant, the State nevertheless possessed sufficient independent information to \u201cpurge the taint\u201d of the first search. <em>See Therriault, </em>\u00b6 59.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">\u00b622  We conclude, therefore, that the information used to secure the second warrant was ascertained through sources sufficiently independent of the first, invalid search to preclude application of the \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree\u201d doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">\u00b623 D. Did Judge Curtis have jurisdiction to issue the second search warrant?</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">\u00b624 Dasen also argues that Judge Curtis had no power to issue the second warrant because she lost jurisdiction when substituted pursuant to \u00a7 3-1-804, MCA. The second warrant was therefore, according to Dasen, void <em>ah initio.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b104-8\">\u00b625 Dasen cites to our holding in <em>Erickson v. Hart, </em>231 Mont. 7, 9, 750 P.2d 1089, 1091 (1988), for the proposition that after substitution, a district court judge has no jurisdiction to issue findings or orders. However, <em>Erickson </em>is distinguishable from the situation here. The judge <em>in Erickson </em>issued an order temporarily adjudicating ownership of the property at issue in the case, after one of the parties had moved for substitution. <em>Erickson, </em>231 Mont. at 9, 750 P.2d at 1091. A search warrant, however, is not a \u201cfinding\u201d or an \u201corder\u201d as contemplated by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>our holding in <em>Erickson. A </em>search warrant may be issued by any \u201cdistrict judge within this state.\u201d Section 46-5-220(2)(b), MCA. Further, Judge Stadler intentionally requested that the court administrator submit the application for the second search warrant to another judge to ensure an independent review. Consequently, Judge Curtis issued the second search warrant with the authority of acting Judge Stadler, pursuant to his powers under \u00a7 3-1-113, MCA (allowing a judge to adopt \u201cany suitable process or mode of proceeding... which may appear most conformable to the spirit of this code\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">\u00b626 Dasen also points to our holding in <em>State v. Vickers, </em>1998 MT 201, 290 Mont. 356, 964 P.2d 756, for his contention that a warrant issued by a judge who is not \u201cproperly appointed\u201d is void <em>ab initio. </em>Again, this case is inapplicable. In <em>Vickers, </em>we held that an improperly appointed substitute justice of the peace, who had no power to act at all, could not issue a valid search warrant. <em>Vickers, </em>\u00b6 29. Judge Curtis, however, like all properly elected district court judges in the state, had general authority to issue search warrants pursuant to \u00a7 46-5-220(2)(b), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"A1xA\">\u00b627 Judge Curtis thus had jurisdiction to issue the second search warrant. Accordingly, we conclude that the District Court properly denied Dasen\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">\u00b628 II. Did the District Court give sufficient unanimity jury instructions for Counts III and IV?</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">\u00b629 A. Applicable Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">\u00b630 The final amended complaint charged Dasen, under Count III, with promotion of prostitution, and under Count IV, with sexual abuse of children. Count III specifically charged that \u201c[Dasen], on or between July 1, 1999 and February 7, 2004 ... purposely or knowingly encouraged, induced or otherwise causing [sic] another to become or remain a prostitute ....\u201d Count III then listed sixteen \u201cprinciple [sic] witnesses/victims in support of [the charge].\u201d Count IV specifically charged that \u201c[Dasen], on or between October 1,2003 and February 1, 2004... knowingly photographed, filmed or recorded children engaged in sexual conduct, namely, V.H. (DOB: 1/14/86) and/or K.E. (DOB: 5/22/87)....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">\u00b631 At trial, the court gave a <em>Weaver </em>unanimity instruction for Count III. <em>See State v. Weaver, </em>1998 MT 167, \u00b6 39, 290 Mont. 58, \u00b6 39, 964 P.2d 713, \u00b6 39. A specific unanimity instruction was not provided, however, for Count IV, although a general unanimity instruction applicable to all charges was given. During the in-chambers discussion concerning jury instructions, Dasen suggested \u201cwouldn\u2019t it be more proper for us to put the names of the people with regard to all of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>counts.\u201d The court disagreed, and pointed out that a \u201cWeaver instruction\u201d was being given as to Count III. Dasen did not object, but instead replied \u201c[yjour\u2019re right, I agree.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">\u00b632 The jury then convicted Dasen on Counts III and IV. Dasen appeals the convictions, claiming that the jury was not adequately instructed as to the requirement that there be a unanimous verdict concerning the identity of the victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">\u00b633 B. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">\u00b634 We review jury instructions to determine whether the instructions, as a whole, fully and fairly instruct the jury on the law applicable to the case. Further, we recognize that a district court has broad discretion when it instructs a jury. <em>Weaver, </em>\u00b6 28 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">\u00b635 C. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">\u00b636 Dasen contends that the jury was not instructed to unanimously agree as to the victim for Counts III and IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-9\">\u00b637 We have consistently held that we will not consider issues raised for the first time on appeal. <em>Weaver, </em>\u00b6 24 (citations omitted). Here, while Dasen generally suggested listing the victims for each count, he failed to specifically argue that a unanimity instruction regarding the identity of the victims was necessary. He also agreed with the court that the problem was sufficiently addressed by the <em>Weaver </em>instruction. Dasen, therefore, failed to raise the issue below.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-10\">\u00b638 Nonetheless, Dasen requests that we consider the issue on appeal under the plain error doctrine. This Court may discretionarily review claimed errors that implicate a criminal defendant\u2019s fundamental constitutional rights, even if no contemporaneous objection is made, where failing to review the claimed error may: (1) result in a manifest miscarriage of justice; (2) leave unsettled the question of the fundamental fairness of the trial or proceedings; or (3) compromise the integrity of the judicial process. <em>Weaver, </em>\u00b6 25 (citations omitted). We utilize plain error review sparingly, on a case-by-case basis. <em>Weaver, </em>\u00b6 25 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-11\">\u00b639  The right to a unanimous jury verdict represents a fundamental right. <em>Weaver, </em>\u00b6 26. In <em>Weaver, </em>we determined that uncertainty about a unanimous verdict brings into question the fundamental fairness of a trial. <em>Weaver, </em>\u00b6 27. We went on to provide two sample instructions for situations where, as in <em>Weaver, </em>there is the possibility of jury confusion in regards to a unanimous verdict. <em>Weaver, </em>\u00b6 39.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-12\">\u00b640 <em>1. Count III</em></p>\n<p id=\"b107-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>\u00b641 Here, the court gave the <em>Weaver </em>instruction for Count III. The instruction read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-4\">The Defendant is charged [with promotion of prostitution]. In order to find the Defendant guilty, it is necessary for the prosecution to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the commission of a specific act constituting the crime within the period alleged. And, in order to find the Defendant guilty, you must unanimously agree upon the commission of the same specific act constituting the crime within the period alleged. It is not necessary that the particular act or acts committed so agreed upon be stated in the verdict.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">Emphasis added. Dasen contends this instruction failed to properly inform the jury that it needed to unanimously agree as to the <em>victim </em>of promotion of prostitution as well as to a specific act. However, the jury was required to \u201cunanimously agree upon the commission of the same specific act.\u201d In order to agree upon the same specific act, the jury necessarily had to agree upon a particular time, victim, and criminal act. The Weaver instruction left no room for uncertainty about whether the jury reached a unanimous verdict concerning the victim of Count III, because \u201cjuries are presumed to follow the law as given them.\u201d <em>State v. Turner, </em>262 Mont. 39, 55, 864 P.2d 235, 245 (1993) (citations omitted). As to Count III, the criteria for plain error review have thus not been met.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">\u00b642 2. <em>Count IV</em></p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">\u00b643 While a <em>Weaver </em>instruction was not given for Count IV, the charge of sexual abuse of children is specific enough that there was no chance of jury confusion. The charge involved a single criminal episode, which occurred at a given location with two discrete victims (K.E. and V.H.), and the State properly viewed and charged the crime as one offense. The jury only needed to find that Dasen had knowledge of the fact that one of the victims was underage, because Dasen did not contest that he was there and took photos of the girls, and it was undisputed that the girls were, in fact, under eighteen at the time. Additionally, a unanimity instruction as to the victim of the crime was unnecessary because the two victims, K.E. and V.H., involved \u201cequivalent blameworthiness,\u201d as both were underage. <em>Cf. Kills on Top v. State, </em>273 Mont. 32, 56, 901 P.2d 1368, 1383-84 (1995). Consequently, we decline to undertake plain error review concerning the jury instructions given by the District Court for Count IV, because there is no uncertainty as to whether the jury reached a unanimous verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"AMn\">\u00b644 III. Were the second or subsequent prostitution counts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>(Counts VI, XII, XIV) properly charged as felonies?</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">\u00b645 A. Applicable Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">\u00b646 In the third and final amended information, the State alleged ten counts of prostitution (Counts V through XIV), each with a different person. Count V was charged as a misdemeanor. The subsequent counts were labeled as second or subsequent offenses pursuant to \u00a7 45-5-601(2)(b), MCA, and thus charged as felonies. The felony prostitution charges (Counts VI-XIV) did not reference the misdemeanor charge (Count V).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">\u00b647 The State, in its motion for leave to file the third amended information, relied upon <em>State v. Tichenor, </em>2002 MT 311, 313 Mont. 95, 60 P.3d 454, as authority to charge Counts VI through XIV as felonies. Dasen subsequently filed a motion to dismiss the third amended information, arguing, among other things, that the State incorrectly relied upon <em>Tichenor </em>because <em>Tichenor </em>\u201cdoes not contemplate nor propose that a person could be charged with a misdemeanor against one person and a felony against a completely different person.\u201d The court denied the motion to dismiss and Dasen appeals from that denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">\u00b648 B. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">\u00b649 We review the denial of a motion to dismiss in a criminal case to determine whether the conclusions of the district court are correct. <em>Tichenor, </em>\u00b6 18 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-9\">\u00b650 C. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b108-10\">\u00b651 Dasen first argues, as he did below, that <em>Tichenor </em>is inapposite. In <em>Tichenor, </em>where we held that the first stalking count properly operated to transform the second stalking count into a felony, the two counts alleged conduct against the same victim, the defendant\u2019s girlfriend. <em>Tichenor, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 31-35. In the case at bar, however, there is a different alleged victim in each prostitution count. According to Dasen, a misdemeanor offense against one person cannot transform a second offense against a different person into a felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-11\">\u00b652 The State counters, and we agree, that the fact that Dasen\u2019s crimes involved separate victims is actually a factor supporting the imposition of a felony sentence. In <em>Tichenor, </em>the victim\u2019s identity was relevant because the defendant argued that the two counts of stalking were actually one count, precisely because they occurred against the same person within a short period of time. <em>Tichenor, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 25-28. We concluded that because there was \u201ca break in [the defendant\u2019s] course of conduct\u201d <em>and </em>because a <em>second </em>individual, the victim\u2019s daughter, was harassed by the defendant, that the prosecutor acted within her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>discretion in charging two offenses. <em>Tichenor, </em>\u00b6 28. In <em>Tichenor, </em>therefore, the uniformity of the victim was a hurdle to proving that there were two distinct crimes. In the case <em>subjudice, </em>the multiplicity of victims bolsters the State\u2019s argument that the subsequent prostitution counts were distinct crimes, to be treated as felonies under \u00a7 45-5-601(2)(b), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\">\u00b653 Dasen, relying on <em>United States v. Rodriguez-Gonzales, </em>358 F.3d 1156 (9th Cir. 2004), also argues that when a prior conviction is used to transform a misdemeanor into a felony, the prior conviction is more than a sentencing factor and \u201cmust be charged explicitly.\u201d <em>Rodriguez-Gonzales, </em>358 F.3d at 1161. Thus, according to Dasen, the subsequent prostitution counts, standing by themselves without reference to a first conviction, must be treated as misdemeanors. Dasen, in his reply brief, further contends that a subsequent \u201cfelony\u201d charge must be based on a prior \u201cconviction\u201d as opposed to prior charges in the same information.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">\u00b654 Dasen, however, failed to raise this theory below. In his motion to dismiss, Dasen only argued that \u201ca \u2018second or subsequent offense\u2019 when multiple persons/victims are involved is misplaced and faulty.\u201d The motion to dismiss did not claim, as Dasen now argues on appeal, that the subsequent felony prostitution counts needed to reference the misdemeanor prostitution count, that a subsequent felony prostitution count must be based on a prior \u201cconviction,\u201d or that the Ninth Circuit\u2019s reasoning in <em>Rodriguez-Gonzales </em>is applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">\u00b655  We have made it clear that a party\u2019s theory may not change on appeal, because it is fundamentally unfair to fault a district court for failing to rule correctly on an issue it did not have the opportunity to consider. <em>State v. Johnson, </em>2005 MT 318, \u00b6 13, 329 Mont. 497, \u00b6 13, 125 P.3d 1096, \u00b6 13 (citations omitted). Dasen contends that by filing his motion to dismiss the third amended information and supporting brief, he properly preserved the issues he now argues on appeal. However, Dasen did not argue that a misdemeanor prostitution charge may not be used to transform subsequent charges in the same information into felonies, and we decline to address that issue for the first time on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">\u00b656 Consequently, we affirm the District Court\u2019s denial of Dasen\u2019s motion to dismiss Counts VI through XIV.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-8\">\u00b657 IV. Did the District Court prevent Dasen from presenting a \u201cmistake of age\u201d defense to the jury concerning Count IV?</p>\n<p id=\"b109-9\">\u00b658 A. Applicable Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b109-10\">\u00b659 In Count IV, Dasen was charged with sexual abuse of children. At <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>the time of the offense, the terms \u201cchild\u201d and \u201cchildren\u201d were not defined.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The District Court, therefore, in an instruction describing when a person commits the offense of sexual abuse of children, added the following definition: \u201c[f]or purposes of the offense of sexual abuse of children, a child is anyone less than eighteen years of age.\u201d Dasen objected to the court\u2019s definition of \u201cchild,\u201d noting that it is \u201can incorrect statement of the definition of a child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">\u00b660 The court did not instruct the jury, specifically, that Dasen\u2019s reasonable belief that the girls he photographed were over eighteen years old would constitute a defense to the charge of sexual abuse of children. However, Dasen did not submit a \u201cmistake of age\u201d instruction concerning the sexual abuse of children charge, though Dasen did submit such an instruction concerning the sexual intercourse without consent charge (Count I).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In fact, it was the State, not Dasen, that argued for an instruction that stated \u201ca person acts knowingly with respect to a specific fact [referring to the girl\u2019s age] when the person is aware of a high probability of that fact\u2019s existence.\u201d The State explained that the instruction was important to give because Dasen was going to argue that he \u201cthought [the girls] were over 18.\u201d The court refused to give the instruction, and commented \u201cI don\u2019t think that [Dasen\u2019s] idea of what age they were has anything to do with that offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">\u00b661 Dasen appeals, claiming the court\u2019s jury instruction and \u201cruling\u201d prevented him from presenting the defense of mistake of age to Count IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">\u00b662 B. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">\u00b663 As discussed in Issue II, we review jury instructions to determine whether the instructions, as a whole, fully and fairly instruct the jury on the law applicable to the case. <em>Weaver, </em>\u00b6 28 (citations omitted). Further, since a trial court has broad discretion when instructing a jury, an error in instructing will be reversible only if the jury instructions prejudicially affect the defendant\u2019s substantial rights. <em>State v. Maloney, </em>2003 MT 288, \u00b6 14, 318 Mont. 66, \u00b6 14, 78 P.3d 1214, \u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">\u00b664 A district court\u2019s statutory interpretation is a question of law, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>which we review to determine whether it is correct. <em>State v. Heath, </em>2004 MT 58, \u00b6 8, 320 Mont. 211, \u00b6 8, 89 P.3d 947, \u00b6 8 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\">\u00b665 C. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">\u00b666 Dasen argues that the court erred by defining \u201cchild\u201d in the context of the sexual abuse of children charge because the term was not defined in the code at the time. Whether or not V.H. and K.E. were children under the statute was, according to Dasen, a question for the jury-</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">\u00b667 The State responds that the 2005 amendment, which defined \u201cchild\u201d as a person less than eighteen years of age, was a clarification rather than a substantive change in the law. The State notes that both the 2003 and 2005 versions of \u00a7 45-5-625(2)(b), MCA, provide a mandatory minimum prison sentence of four years for sexual abuse of children under sixteen years of age, which would be superfluous if the more general provisions of the statute were not construed to protect children between the ages of sixteen and eighteen years of age.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">\u00b668 The interpretation of a statute is a question of law. <em>Heath, </em>\u00b6 8. Questions of law are properly decided by the court, not the jury. Section 26-1-201, MCA. It was thus the District Court\u2019s role, not the jury\u2019s, to determine what \u201cchild\u201d meant under the 2003 version of \u00a7 45-5-625, MCA. We agree with the court\u2019s interpretation that \u201cchild,\u201d taken in context with the rest of the statute, meant a person less than eighteen years old.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-9\">\u00b669 Dasen also argues that the court\u2019s comment, to the State, that the court did not \u201cthink that [Dasen\u2019s] idea of what age they were has anything to do with that offense,\u201d was a ruling that prevented Dasen from presenting his mistake of age defense. As the State points out, however, the court may have been confused about which count the State was referring to, because, as the court instructed the jury, Dasen was prohibited by law from arguing mistake of age concerning Count II (aggravated promotion of prostitution).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Further, the court\u2019s comment was not an explicit prohibition. As Dasen did not ask the court to clarify its comment, and as Dasen had not even submitted a proposed jury instruction concerning the mistake of age defense for Count IV, Dasen is in no position to now argue that the court \u201cruled\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>against him with this remark.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">\u00b670 Moreover, Dasen did in fact argue that he believed the girls were over eighteen. In his opening statement, Dasen contended that the underage victims had \u201cdevised schemes\u201d to create the impression in Dasen\u2019s mind that \u201cthey were older than 18.\u201d During trial, Dasen elicited an admission from V.H. that she heard K.E. tell Dasen that K.E. was eighteen and that she heard L.M. tell Dasen that V.H. was eighteen or older. Dasen himself testified that all of the girls involved told him they were over eighteen and that he had \u201cno clue\u201d that K.E. or V.H. were underage. Then, in closing, Dasen argued that he did not \u201chave the mental state to sexually abuse a child\u201d and that he believed K.E. was \u201cover eighteen.\u201d Assuming that Dasen felt unsure as to the extent he could argue mistake of age, his uncertainty can be attributed to his failure to seek clarification of the court\u2019s comment and his failure to submit a proposed jury instruction on that theory. Having done neither, he cannot now contend that the court precluded him from arguing mistake of age.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">\u00b671 The State rebutted Dasen\u2019s mistake of age claim, in closing, by arguing that K.E.\u2019s youth was apparent based on the pictures in evidence as well KE.\u2019s testimony that she \u201chad braces on her teeth\u201d with \u201cbright pink rubber bands on them.\u201d The State again referenced how obvious it was that K.E., especially, was underage, by asking the jury, in rebuttal closing, to \u201clook at the age of\u2019 K.E. who looked as young as \u201c14 or 13.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">\u00b672  We conclude that the District Court did not prevent Dasen from presenting a mistake of age defense to Count IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">\u00b673 As to all four issues, we affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b112-9\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES MORRIS, WARNER and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b110-9\"> In 2005, after Dasen was charged., \u00a7 45-2-101, MCA, was amended to include a definition of \u201cchild\u201d or \u201cchildren\u201d as \u201cany individual or individuals under 18 years of age, unless a different age is specified.\u201d Section 45-2-101(6), MCA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b110-10\"> Dasen withdrew the Count I \u201cmistake of age\u201d instruction during jury instruction deliberation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b111-10\"> Instruction 16 read: \u201c[a] person commits the offense of Aggravated Promotion of Prostitution if the person purposely or knowingly promotes prostitution of a child under the age of 18 years, whether or not the person is aware of the child\u2019s age\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
