The Rothings sought recovery under theories of strict liability in tort, negligence and breach of contract. The District Court for the Eighteenth Judicial District, Gallatin County, granted Kallestad\u2019s Motions for Summary Judgment thereby dismissing the Rothings\u2019 Amended Complaint. The court also granted two Motions to Compel filed by Kallestad, awarded Kallestad his attorney\u2019s fees and granted Kallestad\u2019s Motion for a Protective Order regarding the determination of attorney\u2019s fees. The Rothings appeal. We affirm in part, reverse in part and remand for further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">\u00b62 The Rothings raise several issues on appeal which we have restated as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">\u00b63 1. Whether the District Court erred in concluding that hay is not a \u201cproduct\u201d for purposes of a strict liability in tort cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">\u00b64 2. Whether the District Court erred in concluding that the Rothings\u2019 negligence claim against Kallestad fails because it was unforeseeable that the hay could cause injury and death to the Rothings\u2019 horses, thus no duty of care existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">\u00b65 3. Whether the District Court erred in concluding that the Rothings\u2019 breach of contract claim against Kallestad fails because it was unforeseeable that the hay could cause injury and death to the Rothings\u2019 horses.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-9\">\u00b66 4. Whether the District Court erred in imposing discovery sanctions against the Rothings.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-10\">\u00b67 5. Whether the District Court erred in awarding attorney's fees to Kallestad and denying the Rothings a hearing in respect to the calculation of attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-11\">\u00b68 Because we find the Rothings\u2019 breach of contract claim dispositive of this case, we do not address the Rothings\u2019 strict liability and negligence claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-12\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b221-13\">\u00b69 The Rothings conducted business near Belgrade, Montana, under the name Diamond R Enterprises which included Diamond R Stables, Diamond R Kennels and Diamond R Cattle Company. Diamond R Stables is involved in the breeding, training and selling of horses; Diamond R Kennels is involved in the breeding of Labrador Retrievers; and Diamond R Cattle Company is involved in breeding, raising and selling miniature heifers.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-14\">\u00b610 Kallestad owns a ranch in Gallatin County where he primarily raises hay and a small amount of grain. He also raises Red Angus cattle on the ranch. Each year since he began ranching in 1984, Kallestad has sold some of the hay he raised, and at times, he has advertised his hay for sale in the Bozeman Daily Chronicle. Kallestad estimated that he sells between 300 and 1,000 tons of hay annually.</p>\n<p id=\"Alg2\">\u00b611 Tanya Rothing\u2019s father, Steven Howells, is in the trucking business and, from time to time, he purchased and transported hay from North Dakota to the Rothings in Belgrade. In April 2001, the Rothings needed hay for their horses. Because Howells did not have time to go to North Dakota to get the hay that he had planned to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>deliver to the Rothings, the Rothings purchased hay from Kallestad for $90.00 a ton.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">\u00b612 Kallestad later testified that this hay was a second-cutting of alfalfa taken from a field that had been re-seeded approximately two years earlier. The hay was cut with a swather and allowed to dry for two to four days depending on the temperature. The hay was then twin-raked (wherein two rows are turned and combined so that the bottom portion can also dry) and baled with a mid-size square baler a day or two after being raked. The bales were then stacked outside on a raised bed of gravel and fly ash from August 2000 until April 2001 when it was sold to the Rothings.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">\u00b613 Kallestad further testified that the hay was exposed to moisture during the winter months and that, one winter, a ditch near the stacked hay overflowed causing water to go along the west side of the stack of hay and then onto a road. Kallestad was unsure whether the ditch water came in contact with the hay, but he indicated that the water \u201cmay have been up there an inch or so.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">\u00b614 On April 23, 2001, the Rothings received 45 to 48 large bales of hay from Kallestad. Some of the hay was fed to the Rothings\u2019 horses the same day it was delivered. On May 2, 2001, nine days after the delivery of the hay, one of the Rothings\u2019 yearling colts was found \u201cdown.\u201d That afternoon, the colt was taken to the Hardaway Veterinary Hospital in Belgrade where the colt had to be euthanized. The following day, two other yearling colts exhibited similar signs as the first colt. One of these yearling colts also had to be euthanized. The body was transported to the Marsh Laboratory at Montana State University where a post mortem was performed by Dr. Bill Layton. The other yearling colt was treated with charcoal, but died two days later.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">\u00b615 On May 3, 2001, Dr. Layton contacted Dr. Robert Whitlock at the University of Pennsylvania. Dr. Whitlock is an Associate Professor of Medicine and the Director of the Botulism Laboratory at the University. Dr. Layton inquired about sending diagnostic samples to be tested for botulism.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">\u00b616 On May 4, 2001, three mares with foals exhibited symptoms similar to the others. They were taken to the Hardaway Veterinary Hospital and treated with charcoal and other medications. One of the foals died during the night. The treating veterinarians, Dr. Gordon Hardaway and Dr. Thomas Jakob, suspected that the hay purchased from Kallestad may be the cause of the problem, hence the remaining hay was removed from the feeding area.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>\u00b617 Shortly thereafter, Dr. Whitlock shipped botulism antitoxin to the Rothings and their veterinarians, but by the time the outbreak was over, nineteen animals had died. Dr. Whitlock concluded that the hay purchased from Kallestad and fed to the Rothings\u2019 horses was contaminated with botulism. He based his opinion on diagnostic studies and testing which he performed on numerous samples taken from the Rothings\u2019 property as well as the location where the hay had been stored on Kallestad\u2019s property. Some of the hay samples that were tested showed evidence of preformed <em>Clostridium botulinum </em>type B toxin.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">\u00b618 The Rothings filed suit against Kallestad on July 26, 2001. In their suit, the Rothings pursued theories of recovery based upon strict liability, negligence and breach of contract. As a result of this incident, the Rothings claimed that they suffered significant damages, including veterinarian bills for services and antitoxin in the amount of $38,549.28; the value of the nineteen dead horses in the amount of $40,000; and the loss of income as a result of the deaths of the nineteen horses in excess of $100,000. They also sought damages for emotional distress from watching their horses die and the resulting economic devastation to their business.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">\u00b619 In addition, Dr. Whitlock advised the Rothings that, as a result of this incident on their property, they are at a greater risk of a reoccurrence of botulism poisoning in their horses and they should vaccinate all of their horses yearly for as long as they own the property. Dr. Whitlock also recommended that the Rothings warn all individuals who might bring mares to be bred on their property of this incident and that if the Rothings ever sell their property, they should disclose this incident. As a consequence, the Rothings maintained that the value of their property has diminished. They also claimed that they have incurred expenses for cleaning up their property as a result of the contaminated hay and for additional feed costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">\u00b620 Kallestad filed two separate Motions for Summary Judgment. In his first motion, filed May 13, 2003, Kallestad argued that, under Montana law, hay is not a product and he is not a manufacturer; therefore, he was entitled to summary judgment on the Rothings\u2019 strict products liability claim. In his second motion, filed June 22, 2004, Kallestad argued that the Rothings\u2019 remaining theories of negligence and breach of contract should be dismissed because, if botulism was present, it was in no way foreseeable.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">\u00b621 The District Court granted both of Kallestad\u2019s Motions for Summary Judgment in orders filed on January 28, 2004, and August <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>18,2004. In addition, the court granted Kallestad\u2019s several Motions to Compel; awarded Kallestad attorney\u2019s fees incurred in preparing the Motions to Compel; granted Kallestad\u2019s Motion for Protective Order; and sanctioned the Rothings by excluding evidence including Dr. Whitlock\u2019s report.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">\u00b622 The Rothings appeal all of the orders entered by the District Court including the court\u2019s January 28, 2004, and August 18, 2004 orders on Kallestad\u2019s Motions for Summary Judgment; the court\u2019s June 29, 2004 order excluding evidence and awarding expenses; and the court\u2019s orders on Kallestad\u2019s various Motions to Compel.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">\u00b623 We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo, applying the same evaluation under M. R. Civ. P. 56, as the district court. <em>Cole ex rel. Cole Revocable Trust v. Cole, </em>2003 MT 229, \u00b6 8, 317 Mont. 197, \u00b6 8, 75 P.3d 1280, \u00b6 8 (citing <em>Vivier v. State Dept. of Transp., </em>2001 MT 221, \u00b6 5, 306 Mont. 454, \u00b6 5, 35 P.3d 958, \u00b6 5). In this regard, we have stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-7\">[t]he movant must demonstrate that no genuine issues of material fact exist. Once this has been accomplished, the burden then shifts to the non-moving party to prove, by more than mere denial and speculation, that a genuine issue does exist. Having determined that genuine issues of fact do not exist, the court must then determine whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-8\"><em>Cole, </em>\u00b6 8 <em>(quoting Bruner v. Yellowstone County, </em>272 Mont. 261, 264-65, 900 P.2d 901, 903 (1995)). In addition, we review a district court\u2019s legal conclusions for correctness. <em>Cole, </em>\u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-9\">Issue 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-10\">\u00b624 <em>Whether the District Court erred in concluding that the Rothings\u2019 breach of contract claim against Kallestad fails because it was unforeseeable that the hay could cause injury and death to the Rothings\u2019 horses.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b224-11\">\u00b625 The District Court concluded that under <em>Martel Const. Inc. v. State, </em>249 Mont. 507, 817 P.2d 677 (1991), and <em>Ehly v. Cady, </em>212 Mont. 82, 687 P.2d 687 (1984), forseeability is a factor in breach of contract claims in Montana. Hence, the court granted Kallestad\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment on the Rothings\u2019 breach of contract claim on the basis that the injuries to the Rothings\u2019 horses were not foreseeable.</p>\n<p id=\"A6_\">\u00b626 However, neither <em>Martel </em>nor <em>Ehly </em>dealt with a transaction in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>goods as in the case <em>sub judice. </em>In <em>Martel, </em>a construction company brought an action against the State to recover interest expenses paid on funds the construction company was required to borrow in order to finance extra work allegedly caused by the State in the reconstruction of a railroad overpass. <em>Martel, </em>249 Mont. at 508, 817 P.2d at 677-78. And in <em>Ehly, </em>the purchaser of a parcel of real property brought an action against the sellers and the sellers\u2019 broker over the breach of a buy-sell agreement. <em>Ehly, </em>212 Mont. at 86, 687 P.2d at 689.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\">\u00b627 In the instant case, the Rothings\u2019 purchase of hay from Kallestad was a transaction in goods, thus it may be governed by Montana\u2019s Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) pertaining to sales if it meets the other requirements of Title 30, Chapter 2, Montana Code Annotated (1999).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Section 30-2-102, MCA, provides: \u2018Unless the context otherwise requires, this chapter applies to transactions in goods ....\u201d \u201cGoods\u201d are defined at \u00a7 30-2-105(1), MCA, to mean:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-5\">all things (including specially manufactured goods) <em>which are movable at the time of identification to the contract for sale </em>other than the money in which the price is to be paid, investment securities ... and things in action. \u201cGoods\u201d also includes the unborn young of animals and growing crops and other identified things attached to realty .... [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">Hence, as the Official Comment to \u00a7 30-2-105, MCA, provides: \u201cThe definition of goods is based on the concept of movability .... It is not intended to deal with things which are not fairly identifiable as movables before the contract is preformed.\u201d The hay in this case had been cut, baled and stacked and was \u201cmovable\u201d at the time the Rothings purchased it from Kallestad.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">\u00b628 Furthermore, in <em>Mogan v. Cargill, Inc., </em>259 Mont. 400, 403, 856 P.2d 973, 975 (1993), this Court determined that wheat fell within the definition of \u201cgoods.\u201d Other items determined to be \u201cgoods\u201d by this Court include: <em>Smith v. General Mills, Inc., </em>1998 MT 280, 291 Mont. 426, 968 P.2d 723 (wheat); <em>Konitz v. Claver, </em>1998 MT 27, 287 Mont. 301, 954 P.2d 1138 (timber); <em>Carelli v. Hall, </em>279 Mont. 202, 926 P.2d 756 (1996) (elk); <em>Trad Industries, Ltd. V. Brogan, </em>246 Mont. 439, 805 P.2d 54 (1991) (elk); <em>Webcor Electronics v. Home Electronics, </em>231 Mont. 377, 754 P.2d 491 (1988) (telephone systems); <em>Norwest Bank Billings v. Murnion, </em>210 Mont. 417, 684 P.2d 1067 (1984) (loader); <em>Little v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number><em>Grizzly Mfg., </em>195 Mont. 419, 636 P.2d 839 (1981) (modular home); and <em>Scott v. Hjelm, </em>188 Mont. 375, 613 P.2d 1385 (1980) (horses).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">\u00b629 In addition to the requirement that the transaction consist of the sale of \u201cgoods,\u201d the seller must meet the definition of a \u201cmerchant.\u201d A \u201cmerchant\u201d under the UCC \u201cmeans a person who deals in goods of the kind or otherwise by his occupation holds himself out as having knowledge or skill peculiar to the practices or goods involved in the transaction ....\u201d Section 30-2-104(1), MCA. Whether or not a person qualifies as a merchant under the UCC is a mixed question of law and fact. <em>Smith, </em>291 Mont. at 430, 968 P.2d at 726 (citing <em>Dawkins &amp; Co. v. L &amp; L Planting Co., </em>602 So. 2d 838, 843 (Miss. 1992)). We further stated in <em>Smith </em>that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-5\">[d]espite the split of authority on this issue, a majority of courts have held that under the Uniform Commercial Code, a farmer may be included under the definition of \u201cmerchant\u201d in some instances. However, whether a particular farmer qualifies as a merchant cannot be determined through application of a per se rule; rather, it is a conclusion that must be reached on a case by case basis.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-6\"><em>Smith, </em>291 Mont. at 431, 968 P.2d at 726-27 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">\u00b630 Thus, in this case, if the trial court determines that Kallestad was a merchant for purposes of the sale of his hay to the Rothings, then the provisions of the UCC, and more specifically, the Implied Warranty of Merchantability, would apply to this transaction. \u201cUnless excluded or modified [], a warranty that the goods shall be merchantable is implied in a contract for their sale if the seller is a merchant with respect to goods of that kind.\u201d Section 30-2-314(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">\u00b631 Prior to the advent of the UCC, the common law concept of \u201cimplied warranty\u201d developed in cases of food stuffs sold for immediate human consumption where \u201ca warranty of soundness or wholesomeness will be implied.\u201d <em>Larson v. Farmers Warehouse Co. </em>297 P. 753, 754 (Wash. 1931). Courts extended the concept of implied warranty to products to be fed to livestock, but initially limited its application to \u201cprocessed and packaged\u201d food. <em>See, e.g., Midwest Game Co. v. M.F.A. Milling Co., </em>320 S.W.2d 547, 550 (Mo. 1959) (attaching implied warranty where the animal food \u201cis not in its raw state but has been processed and packaged by the manufacturer\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-9\">\u00b632 The court in <em>Larson </em>applied the concept of implied warranty to the sale of goods to be fed to livestock. The owner of four cows purchased two tons of hay in the form of 31 bales from a retail seller of hay. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>buyer alleged that the hay contained lead arsenate and had poisoned his cows. <em>Larson, </em>297 P. at 753. Other courts had refused to extend the concept where an inspection of the goods purchased \u201cwould have disclosed the presence therein of the injurious articles <em>....\u2019\u2019 Larson, </em>297 P. at 755. By contrast, no amount of inspection, short of a chemical analysis, would have disclosed the presence of lead arsenate in the hay. As a result, the court concluded that the seller was \u201cliable as for an implied warranty that the hay sold to [the buyer] was not only of the kind and quality ordered, but was, as a lot, generally free from deleterious substances, poisonous to stock.\u201d <em>Larson, </em>297 P. at 756. <em>See also Brown v. Bigelow, </em>88 N.E.2d 542 (Mass. 1949) (extending implied warranty to hay); <em>Thatcher Milling &amp; Elevator, Co. v. Campbell, </em>231 P. 621 (Utah 1924) (implied warranty in favor of purchaser of chicken feed); <em>Gussner v. Miller, </em>176 N.W. 359 (N.D. 1920) (implied warranty that hay was fit to be fed to the stock upon a farm).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\">\u00b633 This Court also recognized the common law concept of an implied warranty attaching to the sale of animal feed. <em>Seaton Ranch Co. v. Montana Vegetable Oil &amp; Feed Co., </em>123 Mont. 396, 217 P.2d 549 (1950). The buyer of oil cake pellets brought an action against the seller when 474 sheep died after eating the pellets. The buyer recovered a verdict in his favor and the seller appealed. A sharply divided Court reversed on appeal due to a faulty jury instruction, but in doing so, the Court upheld a separate jury instruction regarding implied warranty. The Court determined that an implied warranty of \u201csoundness and wholesomeness\u201d attached to the sale of food for animal consumption. <em>Seaton Ranch, </em>123 Mont. at 405, 217 P.2d at 554. The Court rejected the notion that the buyer\u2019s ability to inspect the product should dissolve the implied warranty as \u201c[n]o amount of inspection short of a chemical analysis would have disclosed the poisonous condition of the feed.\u201d <em>Seaton Ranch, </em>123 Mont. at 405, 217 P.2d at 554. <em>See also Valdosta Milling Co. v. Garretson, </em>217 F.2d 625 (5th Cir. 1954) (applying Florida law in determining that implied warranty attached to the sale of horse feed); <em>G. Bernd Co. v. Rahn, </em>96 S.E.2d 185 (Ga. 1956) (implied warranty attached to sale of steamed bone-meal feed supplement intended for cattle).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">\u00b634 Likewise courts in Washington and California applied the common law implied warranty theory to the sale of hay. In <em>Dougherty v. Lee, </em>168 P.2d 54 (Cal. Ct. Apps. 1946), the California Court of Appeals upheld a verdict against the seller of a single ton of Sudan hay, a relatively small amount, where the hay caused the death of plaintiffs dairy cows from botulism poisoning. And, in <em>Libke v. Craig, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>216 P.2d 189 (Wash. 1950), the Supreme Court of Washington reaffirmed its earlier ruling in <em>Larson </em>that the concept of implied warranty applied to the sale of goods to be fed to livestock. In <em>Libke, </em>a middleman had purchased hay from the grower and resold it to various parties, inchidinghorsebackiidingacademies. The middleman refused to pay for some of the hay that had sickened horses at some of the riding academies. The grower of the hay brought an action for the deficiency and the middleman cross-claimed based on the theory of implied warranty. The court rejected the notion that the seller was relieved of any implied warranty simply because the middleman had inspected the hay prior to purchase. <em>Libke, </em>216 P.2d at 195.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">\u00b635 These principles were carried over into the UCC.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Now, under the UCC, goods to be merchantable must be at least such as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-5\">(a) pass without objection in the trade under the contract description; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-6\">(b) in the case of fungible goods, are of fair average quality within the description; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-7\">(c) <em>are fit for the ordinary purposes for which such goods are used', </em>and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-8\">(d) run, within the variations permitted by the agreement, of even kind, quality, and quantity within each unit and among all units involved; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-9\">(e) are adequately contained, packaged, and labeled as the agreement may require; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-10\">(f) conform to the promises or affirmations of fact made on the container or label if any.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-11\">Section 30-2-314(2), MCA (emphasis added). \u201cSurely goods are not merchantable, if in their ordinary use, the goods cause damage to the property to which they are applied or harm to the person using them.\u201d <em>Streich v. </em>Hilton-Davis, Div. of Sterling Drug, 214 Mont. 44, 59, 692 P.2d 440, 448 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-12\">\u00b636 Here, Kallestad would have breached the Implied Warranty of Merchantability if the trial court determines that the goods were not \u201cfit for the ordinary purposes for which such goods are used,\u201d i.e., as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>feed for livestock. And, under \u00a7 30-2-715, MCA, if the trial court determines that Kallestad breached the Implied Warranty of Merchantability, the Rothings may be entitled to both their incidental and consequential damages.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-4\">Buyer's incidental and consequential damages. (1) Incidental damages resulting from the seller's breach include expenses reasonably incurred in inspection, receipt, transportation and care and custody of goods rightfully rejected, any commercially reasonable charges, expenses or commissions in connection with effecting cover and any other reasonable expense incident to the delay or other breach.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-6\">(2) Consequential damages resulting from the seller's breach include:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-7\">(a) any loss resulting from general or particular requirements and needs of which the seller at the time of contracting had reason to know and which could not reasonably be prevented by cover or otherwise; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-8\">(b) <em>injury to person or property proximately resulting from any breach of warranty.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-9\">Section 30-2-715, MCA (emphasis added). The Official Comment to \u00a7 30-2-715, MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-10\">5. Subsection (2)(b) states the usual rule as to breach of warranty, allowing recovery for injuries \u201cproximately\u201d resulting from the breach. Where the injury involved follows the use of goods without discovery of the defect causing the damage, the question of \"proximate\" cause turns on whether it was reasonable for the buyer to use the goods without such inspection as would have revealed the defects. If it was not reasonable for him to do so, or if he did in fact discover the defect prior to his use, the injury would not proximately result from the breach of warranty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-11\">This language mirrors the language of the Official Comment to Article 2-715(2)(b) of the UCC.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-12\">\u00b637 Furthermore, Article 2-715(2)(b), does not contain a foreseeability requirement, thus a seller \u201cis liable for injury to person or property even if the seller did not know of or have reason to know of the buyer\u2019s intended use.\u201d James J. White &amp; Robert S. Summers, <em>Uniform Commercial Code </em>vol. 1, \u00a7 10-4, 733 (5th ed., Thomson West 2006). Analogously, this Court has established that forseeability is not required in connection with causation in negligence cases. <em>See Prindel v. Ravalli County, </em>2006 MT 62, 331 Mont. 338, 133 P.3d 165 (\u201cIn order to establish proximate causation, however, the specific injury to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>plaintiff need not have been foreseen.\u201d) (internal quotation marks and italics omitted); <em>Busta v. Columbus Hosp. Corp., </em>276 Mont. 342, 916 P.2d 122 (1996) (where this Court held that in cases which do not involve issues of intervening cause, proof of causation is satisfied by proof that a party\u2019s conduct was cause-in-fact of damage alleged, and no consideration of foreseeability is required in connection with causation).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">\u00b638  Thus, contrary to the District Court\u2019s conclusion that all breach of contract actions in Montana require foreseeability, a breach of contract action under the UCC does not require foreseeability if injury to person or property proximately results from any breach of warranty.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">\u00b639  Accordingly, we hold that the District Court erred in granting Kallestad\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment on the Rothings\u2019 breach of contract claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">Issue 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">\u00b640 <em>Whether the District Court erred in imposing discovery sanctions against the Rothings.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">\u00b641 Kallestad contended that because none of the other individuals that he sold hay to during the time period that he sold hay to the Rothings had any problems with their livestock, he was entitled to basic information from the Rothings to respond to their claims. This information included test results of water samples, feed samples, and tissue samples, along with feed records, veterinarian records and autopsy reports. Kallestad claimed that the Rothings did not respond to his requests for this information, thus he filed a Motion to Compel on October 29,2001. On December 14,2001, a hearing was held on the motion during which the Rothings\u2019 attorney assured the District Court that he would promptly provide the requested discovery information. Based on these assurances, the District Court denied Kallestad\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-9\">\u00b642 Kallestad filed a renewed Motion to Compel on June 7, 2002, alleging that, despite their assurances, the Rothings still had not responded to his discovery requests approximately six months later. Attached to Kallestad\u2019s brief in support of this motion were eleven letters from Kallestad\u2019s counsel to the Rothings\u2019 counsel following up on Kallestad\u2019s requests for the discovery information. The District Court granted Kallestad\u2019s motion on July 3, 2002. Kallestad also maintained that because of the Rothings\u2019 delays in submitting the information, the District Court had to vacate the original trial date and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>issue a new scheduling order on July 15, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\">\u00b643 On January 21, 2003, Kallestad filed another Motion to Compel claiming that the Rothings still had not complied with Kallestad\u2019s discovery requests and the District Court\u2019s July 3, 2002 order. Kallestad subsequently filed a motion to postpone ruling on this motion when it appeared that the Rothings were about to comply with the discovery requests. However, Kallestad filed another Motion to Compel on July 11, 2003, based on what he perceived as continuing discovery abuses by the Rothings.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">\u00b644 The Honorable Judge John Larson took over the handling of this case on November 3,2003. Ahearing was held in chambers on or about February 13, 2004, during which Judge Larson ordered the Rothings to produce supplemental discovery within thirty days or evidence would be excluded. The Rothings failed to provide the requested information and on June 29, 2004, the District Court issued an Order to Exclude Evidence and Award Expenses. This order barred the Rothings from presenting any evidence discussing the report of their expert witness, Dr. Whitlock, or their alleged \u201csnowballing credit\u201d damages. In addition, the court ordered the Rothings to pay reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs for prior discovery violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">\u00b645 The Rothings first moved to vacate the court\u2019s order and then submitted a request for clarification of the order. In another order dated July 22,2004, the District Court withdrew the language from its previous order that barred the Rothings from discussing Dr. Whitlock\u2019s report. The court further ordered that the matter would be discussed at the hearing scheduled for August 13, 2004, on Kallestad\u2019s second Motion for Summary Judgment. During this hearing, the Rothings\u2019 counsel informed the court that without Dr. Whitlock\u2019s evidence, his clients would have no chance of prevailing at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">\u00b646 The District Court filed its Opinion and Order Granting Kallestad\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment and Order Vacating Trial on August 18,2004. The only reference to any evidence relating to Dr. Whitlock in the court\u2019s order is found in the court\u2019s discussion of forseeability regarding the Rothings\u2019 negligence claim. The court makes no mention of its June 29, 2004 order wherein it barred the Rothings from discussing Dr. Whitlock\u2019s report, or its July 22, 2004 order wherein it withdrew the language barring the Rothings from discussing that report. However, it is clear from the court\u2019s opinion and order wherein it considered the evidence relating to Dr. Whitlock that, although the court had originally excluded such evidence, it reversed that order and vacated such exclusion. Consequently, because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>court made no further orders expressly barring any discussion of Dr. Whitlock\u2019s report, we conclude that the court\u2019s July 22, 2004 order permanently withdrew the proscription against Dr. Whitlock\u2019s report.</p>\n<p id=\"A1K\">\u00b647 In addition, the Rothings contend on appeal that the District Court erred in granting Kallestad\u2019s Motions to Compel. They maintain that in doing so, the court did not order the Rothings to respond to any specific written discovery requests or produce specific documentation. Instead, the Rothings argue that the court incorrectly sanctioned them and awarded Kallestad his attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">\u00b648 Kallestad argues that the District Court has discretion to grant motions to compel, to award attorney\u2019s fees, and to impose sanctions against those who abuse the discovery process. He maintains that two different judges witnessed the Rothings\u2019 \u201cconstant delay and non-responsiveness\u201d over the course of three years and that, based on these discovery abuses, the District Court properly granted Kallestad\u2019s Motions to Compel, awarded attorney\u2019s fees and excluded evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"AhI\">\u00b649 We review a district court\u2019s decision regarding the imposition of sanctions for alleged discovery abuse to determine whether the court abused its discretion. <em>Richardson v. State, </em>2006 MT 43, \u00b6 21, 331 Mont. 231, \u00b6 21, 130 P.3d 634, \u00b6 21 (citing <em>Estate of Nielsen v. Pardis, </em>265 Mont. 470, 478, 878 P.2d 234, 238 (1994); <em>Schuff v. A. T.

Discovery fulfills this purpose by assuring the mutual knowledge of all relevant facts gathered by both parties which are essential to proper litigation.

However, at that hearing, the court granted the parties a week \u201cto file expert affidavit [sic] questioning the hourly rate or the entries, or both.\u201d No actual hearing on the reasonableness of the attorney\u2019s fees occurred. On February 7, 2005, the court entered its Judgment wherein it ordered that the Rothings pay $4,569.00 in attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">\u00b653  A district court\u2019s award of reasonable attorney\u2019s fees is a discretionary act and we will not reverse the district court absent an abuse of discretion. <em>Swenson v.
