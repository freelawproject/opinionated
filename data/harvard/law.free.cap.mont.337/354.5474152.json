After working in several capacities at the store during the following years, Gamble was promoted to the position of manager of the housewares department in 1996. Thereafter, on May 16,1997, she was injured in an accident that occurred dining the course and scope of her employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">\u00b67 As department manager, Gamble was required to lift and move pieces of furniture, appliances, and other items. Her injury occurred while she was moving a desk, weighing approximately 150 pounds, which was contained in a box. As she attempted to remove the box from a shelf, it fell onto the top of her head. She instantly experienced severe pain in her neck. Her left knee was also injured in this accident, eventually requiring surgery, but only her neck injury is at issue in this appeal. Gamble reported her injuries to K-Mart\u2019s personnel department and filed an injury claim form that day.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Azbg\">\u00b68 During the period in which K-Mart employed Gamble, it was self-insured for workers\u2019 compensation purposes. Thus, K-Mart accepted liability for Gamble\u2019s injury claim and paid benefits accordingly. Sears Holdings Corporation (\u201cSears\u201d) is the successor to K-Mart and has assumed liability for K-Mart\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">\u00b69 After the accident, Gamble experienced a number of symptoms including continuous pain in her neck, particularly at the base of her skull, a limited range of motion in her neck, severe headaches on a regular basis, as well as numbness and a burning sensation on the right side of her face. Additionally, the act of leaning forward-to pick up a piece of merchandise from the floor, for example-caused nausea and vomiting. The severity of Gamble\u2019s condition caused her to frequently cut short her work shifts at the store. Ultimately, her symptoms did not subside until September of 2004 after she underwent surgery to fuse a fractured bone in her neck.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">\u00b6 10 Although Gamble visited a chiropractor shortly after the accident, she did not seek additional medical treatment for a number of months, as she hoped her neck would heal on its own. Then, in the fall of 1997, after Gamble missed part of a day of work due to a particularly severe headache which brought on an extended bout of nausea and vomiting, her manager expressed concern over her frequent absence from work <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>and directed her to see a physician. Accordingly, in November of 1997, Gamble went to Dr. Jerry Speer, a board-certified family practitioner in Great Falls. Based on his examination, Dr. Speer believed Gamble was suffering from \u201ca muscular rotational injury with underlying osteoarthritic problems.\u201d He prescribed anti-inflammatory medication and referred Gamble to Dr. Dale Schaefer, a board-certified neurosurgeon.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">\u00b611 After examining Gamble in December of 1997, Dr. Schaefer initially believed that she was suffering from a soft-tissue injury. Thus, he recommended pain medication and a course of physical therapy. Gamble completed six weeks of physical therapy and reported that it did not relieve her symptoms. As an additional diagnostic measure, Dr. Schaefer then ordered a cervical myelogram and CAT scan. After reviewing the films from these tests, Dr. Schaefer came to believe that Gamble was suffering from arthritic degenerative or spondylitic changes in her neck, rather than a soft-tissue injury, and therefore concluded that he could not offer treatment that would benefit her. Consequently, he released Gamble from his care, and she continued to see Dr. Speer.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">\u00b612 In March of 1998, Gamble ceased working at K-Mart due to her persisting symptoms. Then, in September of 1998, she was examined by a panel of doctors at the request of the firm administering Gamble\u2019s injury claim, Compensation Adjusters, Inc. In rendering its report, the panel diagnosed Gamble with, among other things, \u201cmulti-level cervical degenerative changes.\u201d While the panel determined that this condition likely existed before her on-the-job injury, it also determined that \u201cthe occupational injury represents a significant and permanent aggravation\u201d of her pre-existing degenerative condition. Further, the panel determined that Gamble had reached a maximum medical improvement plateau, but also noted that she could require further treatment. Finally, the panel assigned her a 5% whole-person impairment rating and determined that while continued work as the housewares department manager would be inappropriate, she \u201cmaybe able to return to a light duty vocational position with restrictions.\u201d \u00b613 In May of2001, the parties entered into an agreement that settled Gamble\u2019s claims for disability and rehabilitation benefits under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. At that time, the parties believed that Gamble\u2019s condition had been properly diagnosed and that she had achieved maximum medical improvement, in accordance with the panel\u2019s conclusion. However, the settlement agreement expressly reserved further medical benefits, apparently because the panel had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>determined that Gamble could require further treatment. Yet, because Gamble was not diagnosed with a fracture at the time of settlement, the reservation of medical benefits did not extend to that condition. Shortly thereafter, the Department of Labor and Industry approved this settlement agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">\u00b614 In the years following the settlement of her claim, Gamble\u2019s symptoms did not subside. During this time, Dr. Speer periodically prescribed pain medication and muscle relaxant medication. He also conducted testing which demonstrated that Gamble was not suffering from rheumatoid arthritis. Gamble treated with Dr. Speer until he ceased his full-time family practice in 2003. Then, in the summer of 2004, Gamble went to Dr. James Legan, who ordered new MRI testing. Based on the results, Dr. Legan determined that she was suffering from a fracture in her odontoid process, which is a part of the second vertebra of the neck. He then referred Gamble to Dr. Michael Dube, a board-certified orthopedic surgeon. Dr. Dube ordered a CAT scan in August of 2004. The results of that test clearly showed that Gamble was suffering from an odontoid fracture that had failed to heal properly. He recommended that Gamble undergo abone fusion surgery without delay, and informed her of the serious risks associated with such a procedure. Gamble agreed to undergo the procedure and Dr. Dube successfully performed surgery in September of 2004. Consequently, Gamble\u2019s symptoms subsided dramatically.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">\u00b615 Thereafter, Dr. Dube was presented with the results of an x-ray taken in March of 1998, less than a year after Gamble\u2019s injury occurred. Upon review, he concluded that Gamble\u2019s odontoid fracture was visible in these x-ray films. Dr. Dube further concluded, based on the eroded bone margins and callous formation he found at the site of the fracture, the 1998 x-ray films, and Gamble\u2019s symptoms, that her odontoid fracture was caused by the 1997 accident at K-Mart.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">\u00b616 In June of2005, Gamble filed a petition for trial with the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court (\u2018WCC\u201d). In the petition, Gamble contended that she had not reached maximum medical improvement when the settlement agreement was executed, contrary to the parties\u2019 belief, because her odontoid was fractured at that time. Thus, Gamble contended, both parties\u2019 consent to the settlement agreement was based on a mutual mistake regarding the nature of her physical condition. Additionally, Gamble asserted that Sears had acted unreasonably in refusing to recognize the mutual mistake and provide coverage for the medical expenses she incurred as a result of the fracture. Upon these contentions, Gamble requested that the WCC <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>rescind the settlement agreement and award attorney fees and a penalty against Sears for its unreasonable conduct.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AlE\">\u00b617 In response, Sears argued that no mutual mistake of fact had occurred and that the settlement agreement should not be rescinded. Sears also argued that it was not liable for the cost of any treatment rendered by Dr. Legan or Dr. Dube, regardless of whether Gamble\u2019s odontoid fracture was caused by the 1997 accident, because she had failed to obtain authorization to treat with either of these doctors.</p>\n<p id=\"Ajz\">\u00b618 The WCC held a trial in January of 2006. In rendering its judgment shortly after trial, the court found that Gamble\u2019s odontoid fracture was caused by the 1997 accident at K-Mart and that it was present when the parties entered into their settlement agreement in 2001. Thus, because Sears and Gamble believed that she had been properly diagnosed and had reached maximum medical improvement at the time of settlement, the WCC found that the parties were mistaken regarding a fact that was material to the agreement. Accordingly, the WCC rescinded the settlement agreement, thereby reopening Gamble\u2019s claim. Further, the WCC rejected Sears\u2019 argument that Gamble\u2019s failure to request authorization to change treating physicians absolved Sears of liability for the cost of treatment rendered by Dr. Legan and Dr. Dube. In doing so, the court observed that no one knew Gamble\u2019s odontoid fracture was related to the 1997 accident until after Dr. Dube performed the bone fusion surgery. Finally, the court denied Gamble\u2019s request for an award of attorney fees and a penalty, finding that Sears had not acted unreasonably in opposing her effort to reopen the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">\u00b619 Sears now appeals from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">\u00b620 We conduct de novo review of the WCC\u2019s conclusions of law in order to determine whether they are correct. <em>Flynn v. Uninsured Employers\u2019Fund, </em>2005 MT 269, \u00b6 11, 329 Mont. 122, \u00b6 11, 122 P.3d 1216, \u00b6 11. As for the WCC\u2019s findings of fact, however, our review is both deferential and limited in scope. We simply review the WCC\u2019s factual findings to determine whether they are supported by substantial credible evidence. <em>In re Abfalder, </em>2003 MT 180, \u00b6 10, 316 Mont. 415, \u00b6 10, 75 P.3d 1246, \u00b6 10. We have stated that substantial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>credible evidence is that which a reasonable mind could accept as adequate to support a conclusion. <em>Simms v. State Compensation Ins. Fund, </em>2005 MT 175, \u00b6 11, 327 Mont. 511, \u00b6 11, 116 P.3d 773, \u00b6 11. Indicating the high level of deference this Court accords to the WCC\u2019s factual findings, we have stated that evidence will be considered substantial even if it is contradicted by other evidence, even if it is somewhat less than a preponderance, and even if it is inherently weak. <em>EBI/Orion Group v. State Compensation Mut. Ins. Fund, </em>249 Mont. 449, 453, 816 P.2d 1070, 1073 (1991); <em>Simms, </em>\u00b6 11; <em>Wolfe v. Webb, </em>251 Mont. 217, 230, 824 P.2d 240, 248 (1992). However, it must be more than a mere \u201cscintilla\u201d of evidence and it must rise above the level of \u201ctrifling or frivolous.\u201d <em>Simms, </em>\u00b6 11; <em>EBI/Orion Group, </em>249 Mont. at 453, 816 P.2d at 1073. As for the scope of our review, we do not resolve conflicts in the evidence, and we do not consider whether evidence supports findings that are different than those made by the WCC; rather, we confine our review to determining whether substantial credible evidence supports the findings actually made by the WCC. <em>Kloepfer v. Lumbermen\u2019s Mutual Casualty Co., </em>276 Mont. 495, 498-99, 916 P.2d 1310, 1312 (1996); <em>Montana State Fund v. Murray, </em>2005 MT 97, \u00b6 19, 326 Mont. 516, \u00b6 19, 111 P.3d 210, \u00b6 19; <em>In re Abfalder, </em>\u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"ArY\">\u00b621 The \u201csubstantial credible evidence\u201d standard of review is further defined by rules regarding our consideration of witness testimony. As for witnesses who testify in person at trial, we defer to the WCC\u2019s findings concerning credibility and the weight to be accorded to this testimony. <em>Kuntz v. Nationwide Mutual Fire Ins. Co., </em>1998 MT 5, \u00b6 35, 287 Mont. 142, \u00b6 35, 952 P.2d 422, \u00b6 35; <em>Wilson v. Liberty Mutual Fire Ins., </em>273 Mont. 313, 319, 903 P.2d 785, 788 (1995). It is the WCC\u2019s job to resolve any inconsistencies in a witness\u2019s testimony. <em>Walls v. Travelers Indemnity Co., </em>281 Mont. 106, 111, 931 P.2d 712, 716 (1997). Ultimately, because an assessment of testimony is best made upon observation of the witness\u2019s demeanor and consideration of other intangibles that are only evident during live testimony, we will not substitute our judgment for the WCC\u2019s judgment regarding credibility and the weight accorded to live testimony. <em>Wilson, </em>273 Mont. at 319, 903 P.2d at 788.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">\u00b622 Conversely, we are in as good a position as the WCC to assess testimony presented at trial by way of deposition. <em>McIntyre v. Glen Lake Irrigation District, </em>249 Mont. 63, 67, 813 P.2d 451, 454 (1991); <em>White v. Ford, Bacon &amp; Davis Texas, Inc., </em>256 Mont. 9, 13, 843 P.2d 787, 789 (1992). Therefore, we conduct de novo review of deposition testimony. <em>White, </em>256 Mont. at 13, 843 P.2d at 789. However, this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>independent review of deposition testimony is only one component of our task on appeal. We must then consider the deposition testimony in the context of the other relevant evidence in order to properly assess the factual findings at issue. <em>McIntyre, </em>249 Mont. at 67-68, 813 P.2d at 454; <em>White, </em>256 Mont. at 13, 843 P.2d at 789. As we have stated, even where we conduct de novo review of deposition testimony, we are ultimately restricted to determining whether substantial credible evidence supports the WCC\u2019s findings. <em>Weber v. Public Employees\u2019 Retirement Board, </em>270 Mont. 239, 245, 890 P.2d 1296, 1299 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">\u00b623 (1) Did the court err in rescinding the parties\u2019 settlement agreement?</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">\u00b624  A settlement agreement is a contract; therefore, we apply contract law to determine whether the agreement is valid and enforceable. <em>Wolfe, </em>251 Mont. at 223, 824 P.2d at 244.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">\u00b625  The parties must give their consent to enter into a contract. <em>Wolfe, </em>251 Mont. at 227, 824 P.2d at 246 (citing \u00a7 28-2-102(2), MCA). The requisite consent must be given freely, and consent cannot be given freely when it is based on a mistake. <em>Wolfe, 251 </em>Mont. at 227, 824 P.2d at 246 (citing \u00a7 28-2-301(1) and \u00a7 28-2-401(1)(e), MCA). Either a mistake of fact or a mistake of law will preclude freely given consent.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Wolfe, </em>251 Mont. at 224, 824 P.2d at 244 (citing \u00a7 28-2-408, MCA). A mistake of fact, which Gamble alleges in this case, is defined as \u201ca mistake not caused by the neglect of a legal duty on the part of the person making the mistake,\u201d and consisting of \u201can unconscious ignorance or forgetfulness of a fact, past or present, material to the contract\u201d or a belief in \u201cthe present existence of a thing material to the contract which does not exist\u201d or a belief in \u201cthe past existence of such a thing which has not existed.\u201d <em>Wolfe, 251 </em>Mont. at 224, 824 P.2d at 244 (citing \u00a7 28-2-409, MCA).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">\u00b626 Pursuant to these rules, it is well established that a settlement agreement must be rescinded if, when the parties entered into it, they were mutually mistaken regarding a fact that was material to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number><em>agreement.</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> Kienas v. Peterson, </em>191 Mont. 325, 328-30, 624 P.2d 1, 2-3 (1980); <em>Weldele v. Medley Development, </em>227 Mont. 257, 260, 738 P.2d 1281, 1283 (1987); <em>Kimes v. Charlie\u2019s Family Dining, </em>233 Mont. 175, 177, 759 P.2d 986, 988 (1988); <em>Wolfe, </em>251 Mont. at 223-28, 824 P.2d at 244-46; <em>South v. Transportation Ins. Co., </em>275 Mont. 397, 401, 913 P.2d 233, 235 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">\u00b627 A \u201cmaterial\u201d fact is \u201ca vital fact upon which [the parties] based their bargain.\u201d <em>South, </em>275 Mont. at 401, 913 P.2d at 235 (internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, we have stated that a mutual mistake regarding a material fact is a mistake that is \u201cso substantial and fundamental as to defeat the object of the parties in making the contract.\u201d <em>South, </em>275 Mont. at 401, 913 P.2d at 235 (internal quotation marks omitted). Finally, we have determined in several cases that the nature and extent of a claimant\u2019s physical condition is a fact that is material to an agreement settling an injury claim.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Kienas, </em>191 Mont. at 330, 624 P.2d at 3; <em>Weldele, </em>227 Mont. at 261, 738 P.2d at 1283; <em>Kimes, </em>233 Mont. at 178, 759 P.2d at 988; <em>Wolfe, </em>251 Mont. at 231, 824 P.2d at 248.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">\u00b628 Here, Gamble had not been diagnosed with an odontoid fracture when she entered into the settlement agreement with K-Mart. It is undisputed that if Gamble\u2019s fracture existed at that time, the parties were mutually mistaken as to a material fact-i.e., the nature of her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>physical condition-and the agreement must therefore be rescinded.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thus, in order to resolve the first issue raised in this appeal, we need only determine whether substantial credible evidence supports the WCC\u2019s finding that Gamble\u2019s odontoid fracture was caused by the 1997 accident at K-Mart and was present when the parties entered into their settlement agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">\u00b629 Before assessing the relevant evidence, however, we address three preliminary issues related to the standard of review. First, Sears challenges the credibility of Gamble\u2019s testimony regarding the mechanism of her injury and the onset of certain symptoms. Particularly, Sears argues that Gamble\u2019s testimony that the desk \u201cfell\u201d on her is inconsistent with her prior statements describing the incident as a \u201clifting\u201d accident. Sears also argues that Gamble was inconsistent in her testimony regarding the burning sensation and numbness she experienced in her face. At trial, Gamble testified that she had continually experienced these symptoms since the accident, but also stated that she could not remember exactly when the symptoms began. Additionally, Sears emphasizes that Gamble did not report these particular symptoms to Dr. Schaefer even though the symptoms had allegedly been present since the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">\u00b630 The applicable standard of review in this case does not allow us to render our own judgment regarding the alleged inconsistencies that Sears identifies. As noted above, it is the WCC\u2019s job to resolve any inconsistencies in a witness\u2019s testimony, and this Court defers to the WCC\u2019s findings regarding the credibility of testimony rendered in person at trial. <em>Walls, </em>281 Mont. at 111, 931 P.2d at 716; <em>Kuntz, </em>\u00b6 35; <em>Wilson, </em>273 Mont. at 319, 903 P.2d at 788. We have consistently adhered to this rule because an assessment of testimony is best made upon observation of the witness\u2019s demeanor and consideration of other intangibles that are only evident during live testimony. <em>See Wilson, </em>273 Mont. at 319, 903 P.2d at 788. Here, because Gamble testified in person at trial, the WCC was able to observe her demeanor, consider <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>any inconsistencies in her testimony, and ultimately judge her credibility based on these considerations and in light of the other evidence presented. The WCC did so and, as expressly stated in the written judgment, found that Gamble\u2019s testimony was credible.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Therefore, we consider Gamble\u2019s trial testimony to be credible. Further, we note that Gamble\u2019s husband testified in person at trial. He provided testimony that was consistent with Gamble\u2019s, and the WCC expressly found his testimony to be credible as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">\u00b631 Second, Sears argues that substantial credible evidence supports a finding that Gamble\u2019s odontoid fracture was caused by a \u201cnatural progression of [her] underlying degenerative disk disease\u201d rather than the 1997 accident. In supporting this argument, Sears presents a lengthy and detailed description of Gamble\u2019s medical history, which it characterizes as \u201coverwhelming\u201d evidence, and points to medical testimony which conflicts with the evidence that the WCC relied on in reaching its findings. In addition, Sears relentlessly emphasizes the fact that none of the doctors who examined her prior to settlement ever diagnosed an odontoid fracture. Of course, it goes without saying that Gamble was not diagnosed as having an odontoid fracture prior to settlement; if she had been, there would be no basis for this litigation. More importantly, however, our standard of review renders these arguments irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">\u00b632 It is the WCC\u2019s job to make factual findings, while our limited appellate role is to merely review those findings. <em>Kloepfer, </em>276 Mont. at 498-99, 916 P.2d at 1312. In conducting our review, we do not resolve evidentiary conflicts or consider whether evidence supports factual findings that the WCC did not make; rather, our inquiry is restricted to determining whether substantial credible evidence supports the findings <em>actually made </em>by the WCC. <em>Murray, </em>\u00b6 19; <em>In re Abfalder, </em>\u00b6 <em>10; </em>Kloepfer, 276 Mont. at 498-99, 916 P.2dat 1312. To that end, we simply review the evidence that the WCC relied on in making its findings, rather than conducting a far-reaching and comprehensive evidentiary analysis, as advocated by Sears, which would render our role no different than that of the WCC. Although we do conduct de novo review of testimony presented by way of deposition, that independent review function is only one element of our task on appeal, and it remains subordinate to the ultimate determination of whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>substantial credible evidence supports the findings actually made by the WCC. <em>McIntyre, </em>249 Mont. at 67-68, 813 P.2d at 454; <em>White, </em>256 Mont. at 13, 843 P.2d at 789; <em>Weber, </em>270 Mont. at 245, 890 P.2d at 1299. Therefore, we will not consider the merits of Sears\u2019 argument.</p>\n<p id=\"A9b\">\u00b633 Third, Sears argues that we should make our own finding, entirely independent of the WCC\u2019s finding, as to whether Gamble\u2019s odontoid fracture existed at the time of settlement. In support of this argument, Sears argues that Gamble\u2019s physical condition at the time of settlement is simply a \u201cmedical question\u201d which we can resolve de novo because all the medical testimony in this case was received in the form of transcribed depositions-evidence that we can review just as well as the WCC.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">\u00b634 We have stated that \u201cour review of medical evidence presented through depositions must be considered in the context of the other evidence presented at trial which was relevant to the medical issue.\u201d <em>Wilson, </em>273 Mont. at 317, 903 P.2d at 787. Here, in addition to the medical testimony presented through depositions, Gamble\u2019s testimony given in person at trial was relevant to the issue of her physical condition at the time of settlement. Indeed, as explained below, her testimony was integral to the WCC\u2019s factual findings. Thus, because Gamble rendered pertinent testimony at trial regarding her physical condition, and because we do not conduct de novo review of testimony presented in person at trial, <em>Kuntz, </em>\u00b6 35, we cannot make an independent factual finding as to whether Gamble\u2019s odontoid fracture existed at the time of settlement. Rather, we simply review the WCC\u2019s finding on this issue to determine whether it is supported by substantial credible evidence. <em>In re Abfalder, </em>\u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">\u00b635 We now turn to the evidence that the WCC relied on in making the critical finding of fact in this case-i.e., the finding that Gamble\u2019s odontoid fracture resulted from the 1997 accident at K-Mart and was present when the parties entered into their settlement agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"Avh\">\u00b636 Dr. Dube testified that the 2004 CAT scan reveals Gamble was suffering from an \u201cold fracture\u201d which he characterized as a \u201cnonunion\u201d fracture because it had failed to heal properly. In support of this conclusion, Dr. Dube explained that the human body naturally produces new bone matter in attempting to heal a fracture. He further stated that the 2004 CAT scan results show evidence of \u201cold attempts at healing where the bone margins were very eroded,\u201d as well as \u201ccallous formation\u201d at the site of the fracture. This analysis was confirmed by a set of x-ray films taken in March of 1998, less than one year after Gamble\u2019s injury occurred. Upon reviewing these films, Dr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>Dube testified that they show a lucency in Gamble\u2019s odontoid which demonstrates the presence of a fracture in the same location as shown in the 2004 CAT scan.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\">\u00b637 While defense counsel emphasized that the 1998 x-ray films were not interpreted as showing an odontoid fracture at the time they were taken, Dr. Dube testified that such fractures often go undetected in the reasonable interpretation of radiology studies. While defense counsel also emphasized that a 1998 CAT scan of Gamble\u2019s neck was not interpreted at that time as showing an odontoid fracture, Dr. Dube testified that the CAT scan technology of 1998 was substantially inferior to present-day technology, and it did not allow for easy detection of an odontoid fracture. Further, while defense counsel deemed it significant that Gamble continued to work for some time after her 1997 accident, Dr. Dube testified that a fractured odontoid often does not prevent a person from engaging in normal activity for some time.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">\u00b638 Dr. Dube also testified that odontoid fractures do not occur in the absence of trauma, and that the kind of trauma Gamble experienced in her 1997 accident at K-Mart is consistent with her fracture. Further, Dr. Dube testified that the symptoms Gamble experienced after her accident, particularly the pain at the base of her skull, are consistent with the presence of an odontoid fracture. Ultimately, Dr. Dube opined that Gamble\u2019s odontoid fracture was caused by her accident at K-Mart in 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">\u00b639 The testimony of Dr. George Ro, a board-certified radiologist, was consistent with that of Dr. Dube. Dr. Ro reviewed the 2004 CAT scan results and testified that they show a \u201cchronic\u201d (i.e., aged or long term) fracture that had occurred \u201cin the past remotely.\u201d Additionally, he reviewed the 1998 x-ray films and testified that they show a nonunion fracture as demonstrated by a lucency in Gamble\u2019s odontoid. Further, Dr. Ro testified that the lucency present in the 1998 x-ray films was consistent with the fracture that was evident in the 2004 CAT scan results. Finally, Dr. Ro testified that fractures may be overlooked in the reasonable interpretation of imaging studies.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">\u00b640 Sears claims that the testimony of Dr. Dube and Dr. Ro is not credible and argues that we should therefore reverse the WCC because it \u201crelied exclusively upon the deposition testimony of Drs. Ro and Dube\u201d in rendering its findings. First, we note that the WCC did not rely exclusively on the testimony of these two doctors. In fact, the court also relied extensively on Gamble\u2019s testimony. Specifically, the WCC relied on Gamble\u2019s description of how the accident occurred, which was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>evidence of substantial trauma consistent with an odontoid fracture. The court also relied on Gamble\u2019s description of the symptoms she experienced after the accident-symptoms that are consistent with an odontoid fracture. Further, the court relied on Gamble\u2019s testimony that she had been tested for rheumatoid arthritis and the test showed that she does not have that condition. The actual test results were not available in this litigation. Thus, the court\u2019s reliance on Gamble\u2019s testimony was significant because the absence of rheumatoid arthritis ruled out the possibility, advocated by Sears, that her odontoid fracture was caused by that disease after the parties entered into their settlement agreement. Finally, the WCC relied on Gamble\u2019s testimony that she had not experienced any trauma to her neck since the accident, such as falling or being struck in the head, which ruled out the possibility that a traumatic force could have caused her odontoid fracture after the settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">\u00b641 Sears argues that the testimony of Dr. Dube and Dr. Ro should be disregarded because it is based in part on the 1998 x-ray films which are inferior to MRI and CAT scan studies of Gamble\u2019s neck which were completed prior to settlement and were not interpreted by other physicians as showing an odontoid fracture. However, except for the 1998 x-ray films, the results of all pre-2004 radiographic studies of Gamble\u2019s neck were destroyed before this litigation ensued, for reasons not made clear in the record, and were therefore not available for review. Thus, we cannot fault Dr. Dube and Dr. Ro for relying in part on the 1998 x-ray films, despite the fact that these films are inferior to the MRI and CAT scan studies.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">\u00b642 Sears also argues that Dr. Dube\u2019s testimony should be disregarded because it is based in part on Gamble\u2019s testimony which Sears claims is not credible. We reject this argument because, as noted above, the WCC expressly found Gamble\u2019s testimony to be credible and we must defer to the court\u2019s judgment in that regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">\u00b643 As noted above, while our overall review of the WCC\u2019s factual findings is deferential and limited in scope, we conduct de novo review of deposition testimony because we are in as good a position as the WCC to evaluate such evidence. <em>White, </em>256 Mont. at 13, 843 P.2d at 789. Here, Dr. Dube\u2019s testimony and Dr. Ro\u2019s testimony were received at trial in the form of transcribed depositions. Their testimony regarding Gamble\u2019s condition prior to settlement, and particularly their assessment of the 1998 x-ray films, conflicted with medical testimony offered by Sears. However, the WCC found the testimony of Dr. Dube and Dr. Ro to be credible and therefore accorded it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>substantial weight. Having conducted de novo review of these two depositions, and having paid particular attention to defense counsel\u2019s extensive questioning of these physicians, we agree with the WCC\u2019s assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">\u00b644  Viewed in light of our highly deferential standard of review, the evidence relied on by the WCC is clearly sufficient to support the critical finding of fact in this case. The evidence establishes that Gamble\u2019s injury was consistent with her on-the-job accident, and that her symptoms were in turn consistent with the injury. Additionally, the evidence provides a basis for ruling out other potential causes of injury, which we have previously indicated is an important factor in determining whether the evidence is sufficient to support a WCC decision to rescind a settlement agreement for a mutual mistake of material fact. <em>Wolfe, </em>251 Mont. at 231, 824 P.2d at 248 (where the WCC rescinded the settlement agreement based on the claimant\u2019s shoulder injury that was not diagnosed at the time of settlement, we identified claimant\u2019s testimony that he had sustained no trauma to his shoulder after the industrial accident as an important element of the evidence deemed sufficient to support the WCC\u2019s decision). Further, the evidence provides an explanation as to why Gamble\u2019s injury was not diagnosed until 2004, which we have indicated is another important factor. <em>Weldele, </em>227 Mont. at 261, 738 P.2d at 1283 (where the WCC rescinded a settlement agreement because the claimant\u2019s thoracic outlet syndrome was undiagnosed at the time of settlement, our decision to affirm the WCC was based in part on medical testimony that this condition is difficult to diagnose).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">\u00b645  The evidence relied on by the WCC certainly rises above the level of \u201ctrifling or frivolous,\u201d it constitutes far more than a mere \u201cscintilla\u201d of evidence, and we conclude that a reasonable mind could accept it as adequate to support the finding that Gamble\u2019s odontoid was fractured in the 1997 accident at K-Mart. <em>See Simms, </em>\u00b6 11; <em>EBI/Orion Group, </em>249 Mont. at 453, 816 P.2d at 1073. It is irrelevant that contradictory evidence presented by Sears may adequately support a different finding-it is not our role to resolve conflicts in the evidence or to determine whether the evidence would support findings contrary to those made by the WCC. <em>Murray, </em>\u00b6 19; <em>Kloepfer, </em>276 Mont. at 498-99, 916 P.2d at 1312. Thus, we hold that substantial credible evidence supports the WCC\u2019s finding that Gamble\u2019s odontoid fracture was caused by the 1997 accident at K-Mart and was present when the parties entered into their settlement agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">\u00b646  Because Sears does not dispute the WCC\u2019s application of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>law, the remainder of our analysis is straightforward. It is undisputed that the parties mutually believed Gamble had reached maximum medical improvement at the time of settlement, and that this belief was \u201ca vital fact upon which they based their bargain.\u201d <em>South, </em>275 Mont. at 401, 913 P.2d at 235 (internal quotation marks omitted). It is also undisputed that if Gamble\u2019s odontoid fracture existed at the time of settlement, she had not reached maximum medical improvement, and the parties\u2019 mistaken belief regarding her physical condition was \u201cso substantial and fundamental as to defeat the object of the parties in making the contract.\u201d <em>South, </em>275 Mont. at 401, 913 P.2d at 235 (internal quotation marks omitted). Consequently, it is undisputed that if Gamble\u2019s odontoid fracture existed at the time of settlement, the parties were mutually mistaken regarding a material fact, and the settlement agreement must therefore be rescinded.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">\u00b647  Accordingly, because we have affirmed the WCC\u2019s finding that Gamble\u2019s odontoid fracture existed when the parties reached their settlement, we hold that the WCC did not err in rescinding the settlement agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">\u00b648 (2) Did the court err in concluding that Gamble\u2019s failure to comply with \u00a7 39-71-1101(2), MCA, did not absolve Sears of liability for the cost of medical treatment?</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">\u00b649 Section 39-71-1101(1), MCA, provides that a worker may choose his or her initial treating physician. Section 39-71-1101(2), MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-7\">Authorization by the insurer is required to change treating physicians. If authorization is not granted, the insurer shall direct the worker to a managed care organization, if any, or to a medical service provider who qualifies as a treating physician, who shall then serve as the worker\u2019s treating physician.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">Here, Gamble initially chose Dr. Speer as her treating physician. While he referred Gamble to Dr. Schaefer for treatment of her neck at one point, Dr. Speer remained Gamble\u2019s treating physician even after the parties entered into their settlement agreement which expressly reserved medical benefits. However, Dr. Speer ceased his medical practice in 2003. Gamble then went to Dr. Legan who conducted an examination and, based upon his findings, referred her to Dr. Dube who subsequently performed the bone fusion surgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-9\"><em>\u00b650 Sears attempts </em>to avoid liability for the extant costs of treating Gamble\u2019s odontoid fracture even if that injury is properly found to have been caused by her accident at K-Mart. Specifically, Sears argues that it was automatically absolved of all liability for the cost of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>treatment rendered by Dr. Legan and Dr. Dube because Gamble obtained this treatment without first securing Sears\u2019 authorization to change treating physicians, thereby failing to comply with \u00a7 39-71-1101(2), MCA. In its judgment, the WCC ruled that Sears was not absolved of liability based on Gamble\u2019s failure to comply with the authorization rule of \u00a7 39-71-1101(2), MCA. This ruling is a conclusion of law which we review de novo. <em>Flynn, </em>\u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">\u00b651 While \u00a7 39-71-1101(2), MCA, states that \u201c[ajuthorization hy the insurer is required to change treating physicians,\u201d it does not contain a penalty provision, nor does Sears point to any statutorily established penalty that would be applicable where a claimant fails to comply with this statute. Further, \u00a7 39-71-1101(2), MCA, was enacted in 1993 and we have not had occasion to interpret it. However, we did interpret the authorization rule now set forth in this statute when it was previously contained in Montana\u2019s administrative rules. Sears relies on two such cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">\u00b652 First, Sears relies on <em>Garland v. Anaconda Co., </em>177 Mont. 240, 581 P.2d 431 (1978). The claimant in that case, Douglas Garland, suffered a back injury in the course and scope of his employment, and it rendered him unable to continue working for a period of time. <em>Garland, </em>177 Mont. at 241, 581 P.2d at 431-32. In the subsequent weeks, Garland was treated several times by a chiropractor who eventually determined, seventeen days after his injury occurred, that Garland could return to work at that time. <em>Garland, </em>177 Mont. at 241, 581 P.2d at 432. Shortly after the chiropractor made this determination, Garland went to an orthopedist who provided treatment and advised him not to return to work for several more weeks. <em>Garland, </em>177 Mont. at 242, 581 P.2d at 432. At that time, \u00a7 24-3.18 (22)-S18080 of the Montana Administrative Code required, as is required presently by \u00a7 39-71-1101(2), MCA, that a claimant must obtain authorization to choose a new treating physician over the one initially selected. <em>Garland, </em>177 Mont. at 242-43, 581 P.2d at 432.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">\u00b653 Garland\u2019s employer paid benefits for the seventeen-day period between his injury and the date on which the chiropractor determined that Garland could return to work. <em>Garland, </em>177 Mont. at 241-42, 581 P.2d at 432. However, because Garland had not obtained authorization to treat with the orthopedist, his employer refused to pay benefits for the subsequent time period in which the orthopedist had advised Garland not to work. <em>Garland, </em>177 Mont. at 242, 581 P.2d at 432. Consequently, Garland filed a petition in the WCC to obtain benefits. <em>Garland, </em>177 Mont. at 242, 581 P.2d at 432. The WCC ruled that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>employer had properly denied benefits based simply on Garland\u2019s failure to comply with the administrative rule requiring authorization to treat with the second doctor. <em>Garland, </em>177 Mont. at 244, 581 P.2d at 433. On appeal, we recognized that a failure to comply with the authorization rule could result in a loss of coverage for treatment rendered by the unauthorized doctor, but we nonetheless held that the WCC had erred. <em>Garland, </em>177 Mont. at 244, 581 P.2d at 433. Specifically, we held that the WCC should have considered the medical reports and diagnosis rendered by the second doctor rather than simply treating Garland\u2019s failure to comply with the authorization rule as a categorical bar to coverage. <em>Garland, </em>177 Mont. at 244, 581 P.2d at 433. Accordingly, we vacated the WCC\u2019s judgment and remanded for consideration of the orthopedist\u2019s findings. <em>Garland, </em>177 Mont. at 244, 581 P.2d at 433.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">\u00b654 Second, Sears relies on <em>Carroll v. Wells Fargo Armored Service Corp., </em>240 Mont. 151, 783 P.2d 387 (1989). The claimant in that case, Laine Carroll, suffered a back injury in the course and scope of his employment, for which the insurer accepted liability. <em>Carroll, </em>240 Mont. at 153, 783 P.2d at 389. After treating for more than a year with the physician he had initially chosen, Carroll requested the insurer\u2019s authorization to go to smother doctor; however, the insurer specifically refused to grant the authorization. <em>Carroll, 240 </em>Mont. at 156, 783 P.2d at 390; Appellant\u2019s Brief at 19-20. Nonetheless, Carroll went to the very doctor which the insurer had refused to authorize. <em>Carroll, </em>240 Mont. at 156, 783 P.2d at 390; Appellant\u2019s Brief at 19-20. The insurer refused to pay the costs of treatment rendered by the second doctor because it had denied Carroll the authorization to change treating physicians, and because Carroll\u2019s initial treating physician had not referred him to this second doctor. <em>Carroll, </em>240 Mont. at 156, 783 P.2d at 390. The WCC concluded that the insurer was not liable for the costs of treatment rendered by the second doctor based on Carroll\u2019s violation of the authorization rule. <em>Carroll, </em>240 Mont. at 156, 783 P.2d at 390; Appellant\u2019s Brief at 19. In affirming, this Court cited <em>Garland </em>which, as noted above, recognized that a failure to obtain authorization to change treating physicians could in some cases result in a loss of coverage for treatment rendered by the unauthorized doctor. <em>Carroll, </em>240 Mont. at 156, 783 P.2d at 390.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">\u00b655 Here, in seeking to avoid liability for the cost of treatment provided by Dr. Legan and Dr. Dube, Sears argues that <em>Garland </em>and <em>Carroll </em>establish an unqualified rule that a claimant\u2019s failure to obtain authorization to change treating physicians absolves the insurer of all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>liability for the cost of treatment rendered by the unauthorized physician. However, <em>Garland </em>rejects the categorical imposition of such a severe penalty for failure to comply with the authorization rule. Indeed, we concluded that the WCC erred in <em>Garland </em>by treating a violation of the authorization rule as an absolute bar to coverage for treatment rendered by an unauthorized physician. <em>Garland, </em>177 Mont. at 244, 581 P.2d at 433.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">\u00b656 This Court also refused to treat a violation of the authorization rule as a categorical bar to coverage in <em>Hutchison v. General Host Corp., </em>178 Mont. 81, 582 P.2d 1203 (1978). The injured worker in that case, Betty Hutchison, received treatment from a number of doctors without obtaining the insurer\u2019s authorization to change treating physicians. <em>Hutchison, </em>178 Mont. at 91-92, 582 P.2d at 1209. Consequently, the insurer argued that it was absolved of liability based on Hutchison\u2019s failure to comply with the authorization rule. <em>Hutchison, </em>178 Mont. at 91-92, 582 P.2d at 1209. As we had done in <em>Garland, </em>we again rejected the categorical imposition of such a severe penalty for failure to comply with the authorization rule, noting that the rule must not be applied so as to defeat the general purpose of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. <em>Hutchison, </em>178 Mont. at 92-93, 582 P.2d at 1209. Ultimately, because the insurer had refused to pay any benefits from the outset, we held the WCC correctly determined that Hutchison\u2019s failure to comply with the authorization rule did not absolve the insurer of liability for treatment rendered by unauthorized physicians. <em>Hutchison, </em>178 Mont. at 92-93, 582 P.2d at 1209.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">\u00b657 Consistent with <em>Garland </em>and <em>Hutchison, </em>we again refused to hold that a violation of the authorization rule categorically bars coverage in <em>Linton v. City of Great Falls, </em>230 Mont. 122, 749 P.2d 55 (1988). The claimant in that case, Richard Linton, suffered an injury in the course and scope of his employment, for which the insurer accepted liability. <em>Linton, </em>230 Mont. at 125, 749 P.2d at 57. After Linton received treatment from one physician initially, he obtained the insurer\u2019s authorization to treat with another physician. <em>Linton, </em>230 Mont. at 125, 749 P.2d at 57. Subsequently, Linton went to yet another physician, Dr. Bill Tacke, without obtaining the insurer\u2019s authorization to do so. <em>Linton, </em>230 Mont. at 126, 131, 749 P.2d at 58, 61. Dr. Tacke recommended that Linton -undergo a course of physical rehabilitation treatment intended to manage chronic pain. <em>Linton, </em>230 Mont. at 126, 749 P.2d at 58. Despite Linton\u2019s failure to obtain authorization to treat with another physician, the WCC ruled that the insurer was liable for the cost of the rehabilitation treatment Dr. Tacke had recommended. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number><em>Linton, </em>230 Mont. at 126, 749 P.2d at 58. On appeal, the insurer did not dispute that the rehabilitation treatment was appropriate for Linton\u2019s condition, but argued that it could not be held liable for the cost of this treatment because Linton had not obtained authorization to treat with Dr. Tacke. <em>Linton, </em>230 Mont. at 131, 749 P.2d at 61. In rejecting this argument and affirming the WCC\u2019s decision, we noted that the court had, in accordance with <em>Garland, </em>considered the actual diagnosis of Linton\u2019s condition in considering his failure to comply with the authorization rule. <em>Linton, </em>230 Mont. at 132, 749 P.2d at 61. Ultimately, because the WCC had determined that the treatment recommended by Dr. Tacke was appropriate in light of Linton\u2019s condition, we held that the WCC had not erred in concluding that the insurer could not avoid liability based on Linton\u2019s failure to comply with the authorization rule. <em>Linton, </em>230 Mont. at 132, 749 P.2d at 61-62.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">\u00b658 As <em>Garland, Hutchison, </em>and <em>Linton </em>demonstrate, a claimant\u2019s failure to comply with the authorization rule does not necessarily absolve the insurer of liability for the cost of treatment rendered by an unauthorized physician. Although we held that the claimant in <em>Carroll </em>was properly denied coverage for the cost of treatment from an unauthorized doctor, our decision in that case did not establish that the same penalty must be imposed whenever a claimant fails to comply with the authorization rule. As noted above, the insurer in <em>Carroll </em>specifically refused the claimant\u2019s request for authorization to treat with a particular physician, but the claimant nonetheless obtained treatment from that very physician. This circumstance distinguishes the <em>Carroll </em>case from <em>Garland, Hutchison, Linton, </em>and the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">\u00b659 Moreover, to categorically impose the penalty advocated by Sears, without regard to the facts of each case, would directly conflict with Montana\u2019s public policy underlying the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. Viewing the statutory authorization rule in isolation, one might perhaps conclude that the failure to obtain authorization to change treating physicians should necessarily result in a loss of coverage for the treatment provided by the unauthorized physician. However, we cannot view \u00a7 39-71-1101(2), MCA, in isolation. As we have often held, in interpreting a statute we must view it as a part of a whole statutory scheme and construe it so as to forward the purpose of that scheme. <em>Orr v. State, </em>2004 MT 354, \u00b6 25, 324 Mont. 391, \u00b6 25, 106 P.3d 100, \u00b6 25. Further, we have held that statutes must be construed in a way that avoids absurd results. <em>Orr, </em>\u00b6 25. Consistent with these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>longstanding principles, we stated in <em>Hutchison </em>that the authorization rule must not be applied in a way that would defeat the general purpose of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. <em>Hutchison, </em>178 Mont. at 92, 582 P.2d at 1209. Section 39-71-105(1), MCA, which the Legislature has entitled the \u201c[d]eclaration of public policy\u201d underlying the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, states: \u201cAn objective of the Montana workers\u2019 compensation system is to provide, without regard to fault, wage-loss and medical benefits to a worker suffering from a work-related injury or disease.\u201d Given this underlying policy, we must reject Sears\u2019 contention that any failure to comply with the authorization rule necessarily eliminates medical benefits that are mandated under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. Categorical imposition of the penalty advocated by Sears, based solely on a mere failure to obtain authorization, could lead to absurd outcomes wherein an injured worker is deprived of all coverage for the cost of medical treatment that is undisputedly necessary to address an injury which was plainly sustained in the course and scope of employment. Such a draconian consequence is not only unjust on its face, it also directly conflicts with the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act\u2019s underlying purpose of ensuring medical benefits for work-related injuries without regard to fault. Simply put, the procedural authorization rule of \u00a7 39-71-1101(2), MCA, allows the insurer an opportunity to choose a treating physician if the claimant no longer prefers the doctor he or she initially chose; it does not operate as an escape mechanism by which the insurer can avoid all liability for the cost of undisputedly necessary treatment arising from a work-related injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">\u00b660  As for Gamble\u2019s failure to obtain authorization of Dr. Legan as her treating physician, we note Sears does not dispute that the services rendered by Dr. Legan were appropriate for the treatment of Gamble\u2019s condition. Nor does Sears identify any specific factual aspects of this case, other than Gamble\u2019s failure to obtain authorization of Dr. Legan, that would justify eliminating her coverage for medical treatment that was undisputedly appropriate. Rather, Sears simply argues that it was automatically absolved of all liability for the cost of Dr. Legan\u2019s treatment solely because Gamble failed to comply with \u00a7 39-71-1101(2), MCA. As demonstrated by <em>Garland, Hutchison, </em>and <em>Linton, </em>which accurately reflect the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act\u2019s underlying purpose, the law does not categorically deprive an injured worker of medical benefits based simply on a failure to comply with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>procedural authorization rule.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Thus, because Sears simply argues for the categorical approach which this Court has repeatedly refused to employ, we hold that the WCC correctly concluded Sears was not absolved of liability for the cost of Dr. Legan\u2019s treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">\u00b661 As for Gamble\u2019s failure to obtain authorization of Dr. Dube as her treating physician, additional facts are relevant, but the outcome is the same. Sears does not dispute that the services rendered by Dr. Dube were appropriate for the treatment of Gamble\u2019s condition. Rather, Sears again simply argues that it was automatically absolved of all liability for the cost of Dr. Dube\u2019s treatment solely because Gamble failed to comply with the procedural authorization requirement of \u00a7 39-71-1101(2), MCA. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">\u00b662 At the time of settlement, neither of the parties believed Gamble was suffering from an odontoid fracture. Thus, although the settlement agreement expressly reserved medical benefits, it did not contemplate continuing medical benefits for the treatment of a fracture. Subsequently, after Dr. Legan detected Gamble\u2019s odontoid fracture, she went to Dr. Dube specifically for treatment of that newly discovered condition. Then, after Dr. Dube performed the bone fusion surgery, he reviewed the 1998 x-ray films and consequently determined that Gamble\u2019s odontoid fracture was caused by her on-the-job accident in 1997. In light of these circumstances, the proper resolution of this issue becomes abundantly clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">\u00b663 If Gamble had sought authorization to treat with Dr. Dube, she would have been asking Sears to pay for treatment of a condition that was not yet determined to be causally connected to her on-the-job accident. While Sears faults Gamble for not doing so, it is undisputed, as the WCC noted, that if she had sought authorization, Sears itself <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>would not have followed the mandates of \u00a7 39-71-1101(2), MCA-i.e., the insurer\u2019s obligation to either authorize the claimant\u2019s preferred physician or direct the claimant to another care provider for treatment of a work-related injury-precisely because her injury was not yet causally connected to the 1997 accident at K-Mart. Moreover, it is undisputed that even if Dr. Dube had opined prior to Gamble\u2019s surgery that her fracture was caused by the 1997 accident, Sears would have refused authorization and disputed Dr. Dube\u2019s opinion, just as it has done throughout this litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">\u00b664  Because Gamble went to Dr. Dube for treatment of a condition that was unknown to the parties at settlement and therefore not contemplated by the settlement agreement\u2019s reservation of medical benefits, and because that condition was not causally connected to Gamble\u2019s on-the-job accident until after her surgery, we conclude that her failure to comply with \u00a7 39-71-1101(2), MCA, must be excused as a matter of law. To eliminate her benefits in these circumstances would directly conflict with the underlying purpose of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, and we have stated that the authorization rule must not be applied in such a way. <em>Hutchison, </em>178 Mont. at 92, 582 P.2d at 1209. Thus, we hold that the WCC correctly concluded Sears was not absolved of liability for the cost of Dr. Dube\u2019s treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">\u00b665  We have held that the WCC did not err in rescinding the settlement agreement or in holding Sears liable for the cost of Gamble\u2019s medical treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">\u00b666 Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<judges id=\"b403-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES NELSON, RICE and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b383-7\"> The personnel department lost the original claim form and later directed Gamble to fill out another one. Consequently, the claim form in the record is dated January 19, 1998.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b386-7\"> Sections 39-71-611 and 39-71-2907, MCA, respectively provide for an award of attorney fees and the assessment of a penalty against an insurer that unreasonably denies liability or delays or refuses to make payments.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b388-9\"> We have addressed both scenarios in cases appealed from the WCC. <em>See, e.g., Kienas v. Peterson, </em>191 Mont. 325, 330, 624 P.2d 1, 3 (1980) (addressing the parties\u2019 mutual mistake regarding facts relevant to the claimant\u2019s physical condition) and <em>Brown v. Richard A. Murphy, Inc., </em>261 Mont. 275, 282, 862 P.2d 406, 410 (1993) (addressing a mutual mistake regarding the law of subrogation rights).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b389-6\"> We recognize that it is not strictly accurate to say that the agreement must be \u201crescinded\u201d based on a mutual mistake of material fact, because such a mistake technically precludes the formation of a contract, <em>Weldele, </em>227 Mont. at 260, 738 P.2d at 1283, and rescission cannot technically occur unless a contract has first been formed, see <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1332 (Bryan A. Gamer ed., 8th ed., West 2004) (citations omitted). Nonetheless, our cases have often used the term \u201crescind\u201d to describe the appropriate remedy where a mutual mistake occurs. <em>See, </em>e.g., <em>South, </em>275 Mont. at 401, 913 P.2d at 235; <em>Brown, </em>261 Mont. at 282, 862 P.2d at 411; <em>Whitcher v. Winter Hardware Co., </em>236 Mont. 289, 292, 769 P.2d 1215, 1216 (1989). This technical inconsistency is similar to that which is present in the commonly used expression \u201cvoid contract.\u201d The so-called \u201cvoid contract\u201d is actually a contradiction in terms because a \u201ccontract\u201d is defined in terms applicable only to a valid agreement; however, the phrase \u201cvoid contract\u201d is convenient and therefore used universally. <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>at 350 (citations omitted). Similarly, in our workers\u2019 compensation cases, we continue to use the term \u201crescind\u201d as a convenient means of characterizing the remedy that must follow where the parties\u2019 consent to an agreement was based on a mutual mistake of material fact.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b389-7\"> In addressing the contract law principles relevant to this case, Sears cites our unpublished decision in <em>Romans v. Liberty Mutual Fire Ins. Co., </em>2001 MT 64N, despite the fact that we expressly designated it as a noncite opinion and stated in the very first paragraph of the decision that it \u201cshall not be cited as precedent.\u201d Thus, we admonish Sears for disregarding our express instruction regarding the <em>Romans </em>decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b390-6\"> Although Sears does not dispute this application of the law, it nonetheless directs our attention to a portion of the settlement agreement which provides that Gamble\u2019s claim cannot be reopened even if the parties are mistaken as to the nature or extent of her physical condition. That provision states in part: \u201cboth the Insurer and Claimant agree to assume the risk that the condition of the Claimant, as indicated by reasonable investigation to date, maybe other than it appears.\u201d However, this provision is of no consequence. In <em>Wolfe, </em>this Court held that such a provision is not enforceable because it directly conflicts with Montana law regarding the formation of a contract\u2014 i.e., freely given consent is a prerequisite, and consent cannot be freely given when it is based on a mistake. <em>Wolfe, </em>251 Mont. at 227-28, 824 P.2d at 246. In other words, parties may not agree to enter into a legally invalid contract.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b391-6\"> We note that even if some portion of a witness\u2019s testimony is shown to be false or unreliable, the WCC is not required to discount the entirety of that witness\u2019s testimony. <em>Walls, </em>281 Mont. at 111, 931 P.2d at 716.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b402-7\"> We note that \u00a7 39-71-1101(2), MCA, appears to address the scenario where a claimant seeks to stop treating with his or her initially-chosen physician in order to obtain care from another physician. On its face, this statute does not require a claimant to obtain authorization to choose a treating physician where the claimant\u2019s initially-chosen physician has ceased practicing or otherwise become inaccessible. Here, when Dr. Speer ended his full-time practice, Gamble was left without her initially-chosen physician. As a result, she was not in a position to \u201cchange treating physicians\u201d by choosing another physician over Dr. Speer; rather, Gamble had to select a doctor in the same way that she had done at the outset when she similarly had no treating physician. Thus, it would appear that Gamble did not attempt to \u201cchange treating physicians\u201d as contemplated by \u00a7 39-71-1101(2), MCA. Indeed, the WCC assumed that Dr. Legan became Gamble\u2019s treating physician when she chose to treat with him after Dr. Speer ended his practice. Judgment, \u00b6 22. However, because the parties have not squarely raised the issue on appeal, our Opinion here is not a comment on the issue of whether a claimant is actually bound to obtain the authorization required by \u00a7 39-71-1101(2), MCA, where the claimant\u2019s initially-chosen treating physician ceases to treat patients or otherwise becomes inaccessible.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
