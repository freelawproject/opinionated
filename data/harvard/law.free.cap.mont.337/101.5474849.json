Stacey Palmer (Palmer) owns real property in Gallatin <em>County, </em>Montana. In 2000 she embarked on a project to develop, improve and subdivide her property. In the fall of 2000 AFM Contracting (AFM) was asked to submit a bid request to perform underground infrastructure work, i.e., installation of water, drain and sewer systems. AFM submitted its bid and Palmer accepted it. AFM completed approximately $169,000.00 worth of work before disputes arose resulting in Palmer evicting them from the job site in June 2001. After Palmer refused to pay AFM\u2019s invoice for services performed, AFM filed a construction lien on Palmer\u2019s property and subsequently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>filed its Complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\">\u00b62 The District Court for the Eighteenth Judicial District, Gallatin County, held a bench trial in April 2005. Following the trial\u2019s conclusion, it ordered Palmer to pay AFM $162,525.26 plus prejudgment interest at a rate of 18% per annum dating from the date the construction lien was filed. It also ordered Palmer to pay AFM\u2019s attorney fees and costs. Palmer appeals several rulings of the District Court. We affirm and remand to the District Court for a determination of AFM\u2019s reasonable attorney fees and costs incurred on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">\u00b63 A restatement of Palmer\u2019s issues on appeal is:</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">\u00b64 Did the District Court abuse its discretion in denying Palmer\u2019s motion to file a second amended answer?</p>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">\u00b65 Did the District Court err in finding that AFM\u2019s construction hen was valid?</p>\n<p id=\"b129-9\">\u00b66 Did the District Court err in finding that Palmer had breached AFM\u2019s contract?</p>\n<p id=\"b129-10\">\u00b67 Did the District Court err in awarding prejudgment interest at 18% per annum?</p>\n<p id=\"b129-11\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b129-12\">\u00b68 In 1995 Palmer purchased 23 lots contained in Blocks 8, 9 and 10 of the Buttelman Addition to the Town of Three Forks, Montana (the Property). At the time of purchase, Palmer intended to establish a partnership with Gary Perren (Perren), a Montana resident, and develop the Property for residential housing. Beginning in 1996 Palmer worked extensively with the City of Three Forks (City) to have the Property rezoned for residential use and to have \u201cKentucky Street,\u201d a city street included on a plat design, abandoned in favor of her use. She also commenced efforts to reconfigure the Property from 23 to 29 lots.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-13\">\u00b69 Palmer and Perren entered into a partnership agreement in October 1996. Under the agreement, in addition to other responsibilities, Perren was to act as Palmer\u2019s local representative for on-site decisions and interaction with contractors.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-14\">\u00b610 In July 1998 Palmer established the M. Stacey Palmer Profit Sharing Plan &amp; Trust (the Trust) funding it with monies from her former employment-related retirement account. She designated herself as Trustee. It is undisputed that Palmer\u2019s Trust is not registered or licensed to do business in Montana, nor does it meet the requirements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>of \u00a7 35-5-201, MCA, which sets forth the steps a business trust must take before conducting business in Montana.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">\u00b611 At some time before August 1998, Palmer hired C &amp; H Engineering (C &amp; H) to provide various short- and longer-term engineering services. C &amp; H\u2019s early services were to assist her with her dealings with the City of Three Forks; its later services were to aid Palmer\u2019s development of the Property.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">\u00b6 12 In September 1998 the City notified Palmer that her Property had been rezoned for residential use, and in November 1999 the City certified approval of a plat design reconfiguring the Property to 29 lots. The City declined to abandon Kentucky Street at that time but ultimately abandoned it in June 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">\u00b613 In February 2000 C &amp; H created a detailed Bid Package for construction of water, sewer, road and drainage facilities for the Property (Bid Package). Subsequently, in September 2000 AFM submitted a $166,260.60 bid on Bid Form 00300 to Palmer to perform the water, sewer and drainage services outlined in the Bid Package. The Bid Form indicated that if AFM\u2019s bid was accepted, it would enter into an agreement with Palmer, utilizing an agreement form included in the Bid Package.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">\u00b614 During the fall of 2000 Perren had between 25,000 and 50,000 yards of fill dirt placed on the Property. Perren testified that some of the dirt was to be used to raise portions of Palmer\u2019s Property above the flood plain.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-8\">\u00b615 On March 12,2001, Palmer revised the Bid Form she had received from AFM by adding two line items. The first line item instructed AFM to \u201cwrite up and propose a contract for agreement by parties.\u201d The second line item indicated that if Kentucky Street was abandoned by the City, the quote for services would be amended accordingly. She then returned the bid form to AFM.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-9\">\u00b616 In late March 2001 Palmer, as Trustee of her Trust, executed and transmitted three documents to C &amp; H-a \u201cNotice of Award\u201d indicating that AFM had been awarded the contract; a \u201cNotice to Proceed\u201d instructing AFM to proceed with the project on April 10, 2001; and a Section 00500 Agreement Form setting forth the terms and conditions between the Palmer Trust and AFM Contracting. The Section 00500 Agreement was signed by Palmer as Trustee. C &amp; H delivered the documents to AFM. It is undisputed that AFM did not sign the Section 00500 Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-10\">\u00b617 According to the testimony of one of AFM\u2019s owners, Perren told him that Palmer was confused by language in the Section 00500 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>Agreement. As a result, on April 13, 2001, AEM sent by facsimile a memorandum to Palmer enumerating six specific contract terms and providing a break-down of the bid estimate totals for water, sewer and storm services. The memorandum also specified payment conditions of \u201c30 days net 1.5% on everything unpaid after 30 days plus any cost incurred to collect past due amount.\u201d AFM intended this simpler document to replace the Section 00500 Agreement. Palmer made handwritten revisions to the memorandum, signed it on behalf of her Trust, and returned it to AFM on April 24. After receiving the signed memorandum, AFM ordered the required materials.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\">\u00b618 AFM testified that before it began work on the site, it told Perren that the pile of dirt on Palmer\u2019s Property would hinder its completion of the project because some of the dirt was on a portion of the Property that was to be improved.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">\u00b619 AFM began work on the project early in May 2001. Around June 1 it had completed as much of the work that could be done without removing the pile of fill dirt. At that time, Perren and C &amp; H designated the completed work as \u201cPhase I.\u201d AFM consented to the project phasing and agreed to return and complete the remaining work, designated as \u201cPhase II,\u201d once the dirt pile was removed. AFM agreed to do this at the original contract price.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">\u00b620 On May 31, 2001, AFM contacted Palmer, told her the work was nearing completion and requested payment of the scheduled progress payment of $30,000.00. Palmer informed AFM that she had the money for the scheduled payment but was concerned about ambiguities in the contract that she believed required resolution before she made the payment. It is undisputed that Palmer never made that progress payment or any other payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">\u00b621 On June 5 Palmer sent a letter by facsimile to AFM, C &amp; H and the City, contending that the Palmer Trust\u2019s contract with AFM was defective. She advised that any additional work performed at the site by AFM would be at AFM\u2019s risk. AFM promptly replied with a handwritten explanation of the work completed, the cost of such work, and the work yet to be done. Palmer responded by faxing a \u201cNotification of Breach of Contract\u201d to AFM. Around this same time, the City of Three Forks inspected and tested the work done by AFM, and accepted it without identifying any defects with the materials or labor.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">\u00b622 On or about June 7, 2001, AFM delivered an invoice to Palmer representing the cost of the work performed and the materials used to complete Phase I. The total was $162,525.26. Palmer did not pay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>AFM\u2019s invoice. As a result, on July 13,2001, within ninety days of final furnishing of services and materials, AFM filed a Construction Lien on the Property for $164,224.56 ($162,525.26 plus accrued interest to that date). It subsequently filed its Complaint on October 11, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">\u00b623 Palmer answered the Complaint on December 6, 2001. In early February 2002 Palmer\u2019s first attorney withdrew from the case and moved for substitution of counsel. On February 19, 2002, via her second attorney, Palmer moved to amend her answer. Her motion was granted and she filed her First Amended Answer and Counterclaim on March 19,2002. After attempts at discovery were ostensibly frustrated by Palmer, AFM filed motions to compel Palmer to respond to interrogatories and requests for admissions and production. On August 5, 2002, Palmer\u2019s second attorney was allowed to withdraw. Also on August 5, 2002, AFM moved for summary judgment. Subsequently, Palmer\u2019s third attorney appeared in the case on September 13, 2002, and thereafter filed motions to continue pretrial deadlines and revise scheduling orders. On December 20, 2002, Palmer moved for leave to file a second amended answer, counterclaim and third party complaint. On January 9, 2003, after AFM had opposed the motion, the District Court denied it.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">\u00b624 A bench trial was held on April 26 and 27,2005. On September 8, 2005, the District Court held that AFM\u2019s construction lien was valid and that Palmer had breached the contract with AFM. It ordered her to pay $162,525.26 plus prejudgment interest beginning on July 13, 2001, as well as attorney fees and costs. The court then entered Judgment on September 27, at which time it revised the amount Palmer was ordered to pay to $160,655.43 plus prejudgment interest at the rate of 18% per annum beginning on July 16, 2001, and ending on September 8, 2005. Palmer appeals. We affirm and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">\u00b625 We review the granting or denial of a motion to amend a pleading for an abuse of discretion. <em>Denton v. First Interstate Bank of Commerce, </em>2006 MT 193, \u00b6 17, 333 Mont. 169, \u00b6 17, 142 P.3d 797, \u00b6 17 (citation omitted). An abuse of discretion occurs only if the district court \u201cacted arbitrarily without employment of conscientious judgment or exceeded the bounds of reason resulting in substantial injustice.\u201d <em>State v. Hendershot, </em>2007 MT 49, \u00b6 19, 336 Mont, 164, \u00b6 19, 153 P.3d 619, \u00b6 19 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">\u00b626 We review a district court\u2019s findings of fact to determine if they are clearly erroneous. A district court\u2019s findings are clearly erroneous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>if they are not supported by substantial credible evidence, if the district court has misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or if a review of the record leaves this Court with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made. Substantial evidence is \u201cevidence that a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion; it consists of more than a mere scintilla of evidence but may be somewhat less than a preponderance.\u201d <em>Rossi v. Pawiroredjo, </em>2004 MT 39, \u00b6 12, 320 Mont. 63, \u00b6 12, 85 P.3d 776, \u00b6 12 (internal citations omitted). We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law de novo to determine whether they are correct. <em>Rossi, </em>\u00b6 13. We apply these standards to both the District Court\u2019s ruling on the validity of AFM\u2019s construction lien and to its determination that Palmer breached her contract with AFM. <em>See Burns v. A Cash Const. Lien Bond, </em>2000 MT 233, \u00b6 6, 301 Mont. 304, \u00b6 6, 8 P.3d 795, \u00b6 6, and <em>Cut Bank School Dist. No. 15 v. Rummel, </em>2002 MT 248, \u00b6 5, 312 Mont. 143, \u00b6 5, 58 P.3d 159, \u00b6 5 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\">\u00b627 Lastly, a district court\u2019s award of prejudgment interest is a question of law; therefore, this Court determines whether the district court correctly applied the law. <em>James Talcott Const. v. P &amp; D, </em>2006 MT 188, \u00b6 28, 333 Mont. 107, \u00b6 28, 141 P.3d 1200, \u00b6 28 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">\u00b628 <em>Issue One: Did the District Court abuse its discretion in denying Palmer\u2019s motion to file a second amended answer?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">\u00b629 Palmer argues that the District Court abused its discretion when it denied her motion to file a second amended answer. However, the portion of her brief dedicated to this issue fails to comply with the most basic requirements of M. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(4). Other than a passing reference to M. R. Civ. P. 15(a), it is unsupported by authority, is neither succinct nor clear, misrepresents the testimony cited to in the record, relies on exhibits not contained in the record, and contains numerous conclusory assertions.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">\u00b630 As we have stated on numerous occasions, relying on M. R. App. P. 23, it is not this Court\u2019s obligation to conduct legal research on behalf of a party, to guess at his or her precise position, or to develop legal analysis that may lend support to that position. <em>In re Estate of Bayers, </em>1999 MT 154, \u00b6 19, 295 Mont. 89, \u00b6 19, 983 P.2d 339, \u00b6 19. <em>See also Hallenberg v. General Mills Operations, </em>2006 MT 191, \u00b6 45, 333 Mont. 143, \u00b6 45, 141 P.3d 1216, \u00b6 45. However, given that the District Court\u2019s Order denying her motion to amend succinctly sets forth the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>court\u2019s rationale, we will review the court\u2019s justification for denying the motion to determine whether the court abused its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">\u00b631  The court noted: (1) Palmer waited nine months to file a motion for leave to file a second amended answer; (2) AFM had filed a motion for summary judgment and to compel Palmer\u2019s discovery responses at least three months before Palmer moved to amend; (3) Palmer did not present any new evidence that was not available to her at the time she amended her answer the first time; (4) all previous extensions had been for the sole benefit of Palmer; (5) granting the motion to amend would result in undue delay; (6) if Palmer had obtained \u201cnew evidence\u201d in July 2002, she did not act promptly upon making that discovery; and (7) allowing a second amendment would impede the orderly and expeditious progression of the case to final judgment. We conclude that the rationale of the court was well-reasoned and appropriate given the case\u2019s procedural history, and that the court did not abuse its discretion in denying leave to amend. See <em>Peuse v. Malkuch, </em>275 Mont. 221, 228, 911 P.2d 1153, 1157 (1996) (court was within its discretion in denying leave to amend after a motion for summary judgment had been filed by the opposing party). We therefore affirm on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">\u00b632 <em>Issue Two: Did the District Court err in finding that AFM\u2019s construction lien was valid?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">\u00b633 Palmer claims the lien contained multiple defects and that the District Court erred in failing to expressly address each of the alleged defects in its ruling. She also maintains that the court\u2019s findings and conclusions pertaining to the validity of the lien were incorrect and should be reversed. In response, and acknowledging that our case law requires that the procedural requirements for construction liens be strictly followed, AFM asserts that once the procedure has been fulfilled, the statutes will be liberally construed so as to give effect to the remedial nature of the lien statutes. <em>Simkins-Hallin Lumber Co. v. Simonson, </em>214 Mont. 36, 39, 692 P.2d 424, 425 (1984). AFM maintains that it strictly adhered to the procedural requisites of the lien statutes, and that the District Court rendered correct findings on all issues pertaining to the validity of the lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">\u00b634 The District Court found that the procedural requirements of \u00a7 71-3-535, MCA, were met in that the lien (1) was timely filed and served on Palmer; (2) listed AFM\u2019s name and address as claimant; (3) contained a \u201creasonably sufficient\u201d description of the property; (4) named Palmer as the contracting owner and owner of the Property; (5) contained a description of the services and materials provided and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>dates such services/materials were first and last furnished; (6) showed a reasonable estimation of the amount of unpaid services/materials owed to AFM; and (7) contained an explanation for why a notice of right to claim a lien was not required. Based on these findings, the District Court concluded that the lien complied with the statutory procedural requirements found in \u00a7\u00a7 71-3-534 and 535, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">\u00b635 The lien statutes or statutory provisions relevant to our analysis are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-5\">Section 71-3-523, MCA:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-6\">A person who furnishes services or materials pursuant to a real estate improvement contract may claim a construction hen, only to the extent provided in this part, to secure the payment of his contract price.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-7\">Section 71-3-534(2), MCA:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-8\">The [county] clerk may not file [a] hen unless it is accompanied by a certification by the hen claimant or the claimant\u2019s agent that a copy of the lien has been served upon each owner of record of the property named in the lien....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-9\">Section 71-3-535, MCA:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-10\">(1) A person\u2019s hen does not attach and may not be enforced unless, after entering into the contract under which the hen arises, the person has filed a hen not later than 90 days after:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-11\">(a) he person\u2019s final furnishing of services or materials; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-12\">(2) (a) The hen must be filed with the county clerk and recorder of the county in which the improved real estate is located, and the county clerk and recorder may allow the lien to be filed electronically.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-13\">(b) The person claiming the hen shall certify to the county clerk and recorder that a copy of the lien has been served on the owner of record as provided in 71-3-534(2).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-14\">(3) The hen statement must contain:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-15\">(a) the name and address of the person claiming the hen;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-16\">(b) a description of the real property against which the hen is claimed sufficient to identify it;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-17\">(c) the name of the contracting owner;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-18\">(d) the name and address of the party with whom the person claiming the hen contracted to furnish services or materials;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-19\">(e) a description of the services or materials provided;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-20\">(f) the amount unpaid for services or materials or, if no amount is fixed by the contract, a good faith estimate of the amount unpaid, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>designated as an estimate;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-4\">(g) (i) the date on which the services or materials were first furnished; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-5\">(ii) the date on which the services or materials were last furnished; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-6\">(h) a declaration that a notice of a right to claim a lien was given to the contracting owner or an explanation of why the notice was not required.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">\u00b636 Palmer argues that AFM\u2019s lien was defective because: (1) the absence of a written contract under \u00a7 71-3-523, MCA, precludes AFM from claiming a construction lien; (2) AFM failed to serve the lien on the City, as the owner of record of \u201cKentucky Street,\u201d and therefore its lien is invalid under \u00a7\u00a7 71-3-534(2) and 535(2)(b), MCA; (3) the lien inadequately described the property improved as required by \u00a7 71-3-535(3)(b); (4) the lien incorrectly named the \u201cperson\u201d entering into the contract in violation of \u00a7 71-3-535(3)(c), MCA; (5) the lien incorrectly identified who requested the work; and (6) the lien\u2019s statement that a notice of right to claim was not required under \u00a7 71-3-531, MCA, was incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">\u00b637 Palmer appears to argue that because AFM failed to sign the Section 00500 Agreement, no meeting of the minds occurred and therefore no contract existed. However, Palmer once again fails to provide any substantive legal authority or analysis for her argument. Rather, she makes conclusory statements and offers transcript quotations that are misleading and taken out of context. AFM maintains that a contract did exist between the parties and that under <em>Maxwell v. Anderson, </em>181 Mont. 215, 220, 593 P.2d 29, 32 (1979), whether such an agreement is \u201cwritten, oral, express or implied,\u201d it nonetheless supports a construction lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-9\">\u00b638  The District Court determined that a contract existed between Palmer and AFM. Section 28-2-102, MCA, requires (1) identifiable parties capable of contracting; (2) their consent; (3) a lawful object; and (4) a sufficient cause or consideration. The court reviewed multiple contract-related documents generated and exchanged between the parties and concluded that while not all of the documents were signed by both parties, some were. The court noted also that Palmer testified that a contract existed, that she asked for and wanted the work done by AFM, and that she intended to pay them for their work. Whether or not a contract exists is a combined issue of fact and law. <em>Austin v. Cash, </em>274 Mont. 54, 59, 906 P.2d 669, 672 (1995). The court\u2019s findings of fact pertaining to the existence of a contract are supported by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>substantial credible evidence and therefore are not clearly erroneous. Its conclusion of law, based on these facts, is correct as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">\u00b639 Palmer also claims that AFM\u2019s lien is invalid under \u00a7\u00a7 71-3-534(2) and 535(2)(b), MCA, because AFM failed to serve the hen on the City, as the owner of record of \u201cKentucky Street.\u201d While the District Court did not address this alleged defect, we are not persuaded by Palmer\u2019s claim. AFM\u2019s construction lien describes the real property subject to the lien as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-5\">Lots 1A, 2A, 3A, 4A, 5A, 6A, 7A, 8A and 9A of Block 8A; Lots 1A, 2A, 3A, 4A, 5A, 6A, 7A, and 8A of Block 9A; Lots 1A, 2A, 3A, 4A, 5A, 6A, 7A, 8A, 9A, 10A, 11A, and 12A of Block 10A, ... formally known as Block 8, 9 and 10 of the Buttleman Addition to the Town of Three Forks, Montana ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">It is undisputed that Palmer owns this Property and that it is on this Property that AFM performed work requested by Palmer. While the City of Three Forks may have had an ownership or easement interest in the strip of land designated as the future location of \u201cKentucky Street,\u201d the evidence appears to support the conclusion that the City abandoned that interest in favor of Palmer before AFM\u2019s lien was filed. As a result, AFM served the only \u201cowner of record of the property named in the lien.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">\u00b640  Palmer also challenges the property description because it fails to refer to \u201cKentucky Street\u201d and fails to reflect that the final configuration of the parcel contained 31 lots rather than the 29 identified in the lien. We conclude, however, that AFM\u2019s description of the property subject to the lien \u201cwas sufficient to identify it.\u201d Presumably the property as described in the lien encompasses the entire \u201cfootprint\u201d of Palmer\u2019s property, whether it is configured as 29 lots or 31. As we held in <em>Swain v. Battershell, </em>1999 MT 101, \u00b6 26, 294 Mont. 282, \u00b6 26, 983 P.2d 873, \u00b6 26, the procedural requirements exist to notify the owner of real property that a lien has been filed against his or her property, and to protect all parties dealing with the property, including subsequent purchasers. We conclude that AFM\u2019s lien property description adequately does so. As we also stated in <em>Swain, </em>\u00b6 26, we will strictly construe the procedural requirements of the construction lien statutes, but once the procedure has been fulfilled, we will liberally construe the statutes so as to give effect to their remedial purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-8\">\u00b641 Next, Palmer maintains that the lien incorrectly named her rather than the Palmer Trust as the person entering into the contract and requesting the work. The District Court found that there was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>\u201clittle, if any, appreciable difference between Palmer and the Trust.\u201d The record supports the court\u2019s finding. Palmer was the sole trustor, beneficiary, and trustee. She made all the decisions with regards to the management, direction, and purpose of the Trust. The court also concluded, as a matter of law, that Palmer ratified any agreements that may have existed between the Trust and AFM when she accepted the benefits AFM bestowed upon the land she owned. Moreover, the District Court concluded that Palmer\u2019s Trust was not authorized to transact business in Montana under \u00a7 35-5-201, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">\u00b642 Section 35-5-201, MCA, establishes the process by which a \u201cforeign\u201d (any trust not organized under Montana laws) business trust becomes licensed to do business in the State of Montana. Its requirements are precise and detailed. However, there is no need to set forth the statute\u2019s requirements here, as it is undisputed that Palmer\u2019s Trust did not comply with any of the requirements of the applicable statute. The record supports the District Court\u2019s findings and conclusion that the Palmer Trust was not authorized to conduct business in the State of Montana. This being so, the District Court did not err in concluding that it was Palmer who entered into the contract and requested the work.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">\u00b643 Lastly, Palmer argues that the lien\u2019s statement indicating that \u201cno notice of right to claim a lien was required to be given pursuant to Section 71-3-531(a), because services and materials were furnished directly to the owner at his/her/its request\u201d was incorrect because the City was not served. As we held earlier, there is no evidence in the record that \u201cKentucky Street\u201d was owned by the City at the time the lien was filed, and therefore no service of the lien to the City was necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">\u00b644  For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the District Court\u2019s findings vis-a-vis the validity of AFM\u2019s lien were supported by the evidence and its legal conclusions based on these findings are not incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">\u00b645 <em>Issue Three: Did the District Court err in finding that Palmer had breached AFM\u2019s contract?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">\u00b646 As we note above, the District Court\u2019s conclusion that a contract existed between Palmer and AFM was not erroneous. Therefore, we now address whether the court\u2019s determination that Palmer breached the contract was correct. Again, Palmer\u2019s argument on appeal lacks legal authority or analysis. She argues that no contract existed and outlines the ways in which she perceives AFM \u201creneged on their obligations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b139-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>\u00b647 The District Court\u2019s rationale in concluding that Palmer breached the contract is simple-\u201cPalmer breached the contract with AFM by failing to pay AFM for the work performed.\u201d The court also determined that Palmer had failed to meet her burden of proof that AFM had breached the contract, trespassed on her property and caused her emotional distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\">\u00b648 The District Court heard significant testimony regarding Palmer\u2019s plans to develop this Property. Evidence was presented that Palmer, or Perren on Palmer\u2019s behalf, sought a bid from AFM to perform services. It is undisputed that Palmer notified AFM that she accepted its bid and it should proceed with the work. She told the court that she wanted the services, intended to pay for them and had the money to do so. She testified that she offered to pay the scheduled progress payment at the conclusion of the work but she wished to resolve a few contract concerns first. It is further undisputed that, despite knowing the work to be substantially complete, Palmer refused to pay AFM. AFM argued to the District Court that this constituted a breach of the agreement between the parties and resulted in unjust enrichment of Palmer.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">\u00b649 Based on the District Court\u2019s finding that AFM and Palmer both desired that the project commence with a price certain and a firm completion date, and that Palmer benefited from the labor and materials expended by AFM in its effort to complete the project, the court\u2019s conclusion that Palmer breached the contract by failing to pay the agreed-upon price is not incorrect. Additionally, the court specifically determined that the amount billed by AFM for the work performed was in accordance with its contract bid and was reasonable and competitive. We therefore affirm the court on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">\u00b650 <em>Issue Four: Did the District Court err in awarding prejudgment interest at 18% per </em>annum?</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">\u00b651 The District Court, without explanation or analysis, awarded AFM 18% prejudgment interest on the amount of damages it claimed. Palmer relies solely upon \u00a7 31-1-107, MCA, to support her claim that 18% interest exceeds the amount lawfully allowed and is usurious. However, Palmer\u2019s reliance on \u00a7 31-1-107, MCA, is misplaced. Title 31, Part 1 of the MCA specifically addresses interest rates associated with loans of money. The interest rate awarded by the District Court in the case before us is not for a loan of money but rather is premised upon a contractually-agreed upon finance charge owed on the balance of funds due and unpaid after thirty days.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">\u00b652 One of the documents signed by both parties during contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>development was a simple memorandum on AFM letterhead setting forth six easily understood terms. The sixth and last term stated in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-4\">Payment Conditions:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-5\">30 days net <em>1.5% </em>on everything unpaid after 30 days plus any cost incurred to collect past due amount. We will deduct 10% off if paid within 10 working days after City of Three Forks final approval.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aov\">Palmer made a hand-written revision to these payment conditions essentially seeking the 10% offered reduction in the event she paid at least 80% of the outstanding balance within ten days after the City\u2019s final approval. She did not challenge the 1.5% per month interest (i.e., 18% per annum), nor did she attempt to negotiate a lower interest rate. As noted above, both she and AFM signed this document.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">\u00b653 AFM directs us to <em>E.C.A. Environ. Management v. Toenyes, </em>208 Mont. 336, 679 P.2d 213 (1984). There, the District Court concluded that a fuel bill provision allowing 18% interest on unpaid balances more than thirty days old was usurious and awarded 6% interest. On appeal, we reversed, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-7\">The fuel transaction was not a subterfuge devised to conceal what was in fact a loan.... Here, there was neither the intent to loan a sum of money nor the intent to extract usurious interest. Terra-Spread took possession of the goods without paying and received a significant benefit. For this benefit, the seller is justified in imposing an additional charge. The contractor on receiving the goods, signed and received an invoice that contained an agreement providing for charging an annual interest rate of 18 percent on balances more than thirty days old. Without more, this agreement constitutes a simple commercial charge agreement to which usury laws are inapplicable. <em>Empire Building Supply v. EKO Investments, Inc. </em>(1979), 40 Or.App. 739, 596 P.2d 593.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A2K\"><em>E.C.A., </em>208 Mont. at 342, 679 P.2d at 216.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">\u00b654  While factually distinguishable from the case before us, the analysis in <em>E.C.A. </em>is applicable. Palmer sought the services she received from AFM with the understanding that she would pay for these services. She signed an agreement, even modifying part of the agreement to her benefit, yet agreeing to 18% per annum interest on the unpaid balance. Under <em>E. C.A., </em>this contractually-agreed upon rate is not usurious and the District Court did not err in awarding it.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-9\">\u00b655  Finally, as argued by AFM, under \u00a7 71-3-124(1), MCA, a successful lien claimant is entitled to recover attorney fees and costs incurred at trial and upon appeal. The statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>In an action to foreclose any of the liens provided for by part 3,4, 5, 6, 8, or 10 of this chapter, the court shall allow as costs the money paid and attorney fees incurred for filing and recording the lien and reasonable attorney fees in the district and supreme courts. The costs and attorney fees must be allowed to each claimant whose lien is established, and the reasonable attorney fees must be allowed to the defendant against whose property a lien is claimed if the lien is not established.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b141-4\">As recognized above, AFM\u2019s lien was filed under Title 71, Chapter 3, Part 5, and therefore \u00a7 71-3-124(1), MCA, is applicable. AFM is therefore entitled to its reasonable attorney fees incurred in both the district court and this Court. Accordingly, we remand for a determination of AFM\u2019s reasonable costs and attorney fees incurred on appeal, pursuant to the requisites of <em>Plath v. Schonrock, </em>2003 MT 21, \u00b6 36, 314 Mont. 101, \u00b6 36, 64 P.3d 984, \u00b6 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">\u00b656 For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the District Court\u2019s Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law and Judgment. We remand to the District Court for a determination of AFM\u2019s reasonable attorney fees and costs incurred on appeal.</p>\n<judges id=\"b141-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES NELSON, MORRIS and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
