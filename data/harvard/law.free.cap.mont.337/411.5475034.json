(Murphy Homes), damages, punitive damages, attorney\u2019s fees and costs. The case involves a cost-plus contract wherein Murphy Homes agreed to do certain building and remodeling to Aberle/Muller\u2019s residence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-9\">\u00b62 Aberle/Muller present eleven issues for review, however, their brief is broken down into six main issues or contentions (as Aberle/Muller refer to them) and more than 23 sub-issues. Such a \u201cshotgun\u201d approach serves no useful purpose and tends to obfuscate legitimate issues by peppering them with irrelevant asides. With difficulty we have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>disentangled Aberle/Muller\u2019s morass of issues and have consolidated them into the following seven issues:</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">\u00b63 1. Whether the District Court erred in denying Aberle/Muller\u2019s First and Third Motions for Summary Judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">\u00b64 2. Whether the District Court erred in denying Aberle/Muller\u2019s Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">\u00b65 3. Whether the District Court erred in barring Aberle/Muller\u2019s \u201cforeseeability\u201d defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">\u00b66 4. Whether the District Court erred in denying Aberle/Muller\u2019s Motion to Continue and, instead, ordering a bifurcated trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-9\">\u00b67 5. Whether the District Court erred in permitting the jury to view Aberle/Muller\u2019s residence and in admitting other evidence of Aberle/Muller\u2019s financial condition on the issue of liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-10\">\u00b68 6. Whether the District Court erred in refusing Aberle/Muller\u2019s proposed jury instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-11\">\u00b69 7. Whether the District Court erred in denying Aberle/Muller\u2019s post-trial motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-12\">\u00b610 In addition, Murphy Homes has asked for an award of attorney\u2019s fees on appeal if we affirm the District Court\u2019s Judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-13\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b440-14\">\u00b611 Aberle/Muller hired Murphy Homes to remodel their existing home, construct a new building next to it, and connect the two, forming a U-shaped building to be used as Aberle/Muller\u2019s personal residence. Murphy Homes originally estimated the work at $438,000.00, but as Murphy Homes\u2019 President, John Murphy, and Aberle/Muller\u2019s architect, Robert Karhu, both testified, there was no actual bidding and no fixed price was established.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-15\">\u00b612 Aberle/Muller and Murphy Homes entered into a cost-plus contract for the proposed construction. Under the contract, Aberle/Muller were to reimburse Murphy Homes for actual costs plus a contractor\u2019s fee of 15% of the costs of material and labor as its compensation for managing the project and overseeing the subcontractors.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-16\">\u00b613 Once the project commenced, Aberle/Muller ordered numerous changes to the architect\u2019s original plans. Murphy Homes alleges that while the original plans called for minor remodeling of the existing structure, in the end, that structure was completely gutted and new electrical and plumbing systems were added, along with a new roof, new windows and new exterior siding.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-17\">\u00b614 Murphy Homes also alleges that when costs on the project reached $638,000.00, it became concerned about the costs it was carrying and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>about the 15% contractor\u2019s fee. Hence, Murphy Homes sent a bill to Aberle/Muller for $11,000.00 representing the 15% fee on the most recent construction draw. Murphy Homes further alleges that, besides the 15% contractor\u2019s fee, Aberle/Muller still owed Murphy Homes $160,000.00 for construction costs already incurred and paid by Murphy Homes.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\">\u00b615 Aberle/Muller allege that there were no written change orders or change directives adjusting the contract sum or the contract price which would have entitled Murphy Homes to more fees for changes in the work. They also allege that they paid Murphy Homes its entire fee and that when Murphy Homes realized that it had miscalculated its fee on the project, Murphy Homes made a claim for additional fees to be applied to the remainder of the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">\u00b616 Ata meeting on September 4,2002, Aberle stated that he would not pay Murphy Homes any more money, consequently the relationship ended. Aberle/Muller contend that when they refused to pay the additional fee, Murphy Homes walked off the job and abandoned the project, leaving them to find other contractors to finish the work. Murphy Homes contends, on the other hand, that it was, in effect, fired from the project when Aberle/Muller refused to pay the additional fee.</p>\n<p id=\"AyK\">\u00b617 After the relationship ended, Aberle/Muller paid Murphy Homes the $160,000.00 for construction costs already incurred, but refused to pay the $11,000.00 contractor\u2019s fee. On November 19, 2002, Murphy Homes filed a Complaint seeking to foreclose on a construction hen it had filed against the property. Aberle/Muller counterclaimed alleging defective work, fraud, slander of title and other claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">\u00b618 During a protracted and contentious pretrial process, both parties filed numerous Motions to Compel and Motions for Sanctions which we need not go into here. The trial commenced on January 26, 2004, with a six-person jury and two alternates. The trial was originally scheduled for five days, however, as the trial got underway, it became apparent that five days was not sufficient, thus the District Court rearranged its court calendar to provide two more days. Nevertheless, after seven days, Aberle/Muller had only begun to present their defense, hence, the District Court ordered that the trial resume at some unspecified time in the future when the court could find additional time in its busy schedule.</p>\n<p id=\"AkX\">\u00b619 After some difficulty in setting a date to resume trial (the details of which will be addressed more specifically under Issue 4), trial resumed August 9, 2004, and continued through August 12, 2004. The jury affirmatively responded to the question of whether Aberle/Muller had acted with fraud, deceit and malice towards Murphy Homes and they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>returned a unanimous verdict awarding Murphy Homes $366,100.00 in damages. Shortly thereafter, a punitive damages hearing took place wherein the jury unanimously awarded another $366,000.00 in punitive damages to Murphy Homes. The total judgment against Aberle/Muller was $896,494.62, which included accrued interest, attorney\u2019s fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">\u00b620 After trial, Aberle/Muller filed numerous post-trial motions including a Motion to Amend Judgment, a Motion to Limit Punitive Damages, and Defendants\u2019 Motion for Attorney\u2019s Fees and Costs, all of which were denied by the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">\u00b621 Aberle/Muller appeal the District Court\u2019s Judgment. Additional facts are set forth where necessary to our resolution of the issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">\u00b622 Before examining the issues, we note that rather than setting forth the procedural background of this case in their brief as required by M. R. App. P. 23(a)(3), Aberle/Muller included that information in an appendix to their brief. In response, Murphy Homes asks this Court to disregard those eleven pages in Aberle/Muller\u2019s appendix and strike them from the record on appeal because they violate this Court\u2019s hmitations on the length of briefs to be filed in this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">\u00b623  Murphy Homes\u2019 argument is well taken. By including in their appendix information that should have been included in their brief itself, Aberle/Muller not only violated M. R. App. P. 27(d), regarding the length of briefs allowed on appeal, but they violated M. R. App. P. 25(b), which sets forth what documents may be contained in an appendix to a brief.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"APR\">[A]n appendix shall contain: (1) the relevant docket entries in the proceeding below; (2) any relevant pleading and relevant given or refused jury instruction, finding and opinion; (3) the judgment, order, findings of fact, conclusions of law, or decision in question, together with the memorandum opinion, if any, in support thereof; and (4) such other parts of the record as any party deems it essential for the judges of the court to read in order to decide the issues presented.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-9\">M. R. App. P. 25(b). A summary of a party\u2019s view of the proceedings below is wholly inappropriate for including in an appendix to a brief on appeal. Consequently, we conclude that Aberle/Muller\u2019s Appendix 7 consisting of eleven pages and entitled \u201cDetail of the District Court Proceedings\u201d is appropriately stricken from the record on appeal, and we have disregarded it.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-10\">\u00b624 We also note that Aberle/Muller have asked this Court to adopt and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>incorporate by reference into their brief facts; citations to deposition and trial testimony; authorities; and argument contained in their numerous filings before the District Court. This is also an attempt to circumvent this Court\u2019s page limitations on briefing. To do as Aberle/Muller ask would in effect add another 200 pages to Aberle/Muller\u2019s brief. M. R. App. P. 23(a)(4) \u201crequires that an appellant present a concise, cohesive argument which \u2018contain[s] the contentions of the appellant with respect to the issues presented, and the reasons therefor, with citations to the authorities, statutes and pages of the record relied on.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Marriage of McMahon, </em>2002 MT 198, \u00b6 6, 311 Mont. 175, \u00b6 6, 53 P.3d 1266, \u00b6 6.</p>\n<p id=\"Af\">\u00b625 Aberle/Muller\u2019s brief is neither concise nor cohesive, and it has been with great difficulty that this Court has slogged through the quagmire of issues and contentions presented by Aberle/Muller on appeal. Nevertheless, we have managed to drain the swamp sufficiently to reveal at the bottom, seven issues for review by this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\">Issue 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">\u00b626 <em>Whether the District Court erred in denying Aberle /Muller\u2019s First and Third Motions for Summary Judgment.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">\u00b627 In its First Motion for Summary Judgment, Aberle/Muller argued that the facts are \u201cuncontroverted\u201d that the contract price had been paid in full because there were no written change orders or directives as required by the contract which would have entitled Murphy Homes to additional profit or overheard. Similarly, in their Third Motion for Summary Judgment, Aberle/Muller argued that the facts are \u201cuncontroverted\u201d that the contract price has been paid in full because Montana hen law prohibits Murphy Homes\u2019 claim as it constitutes a claim for profits and general overhead and not for performance of services or the furnishing of materials.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">\u00b628 In its response to Aberle/Muller\u2019s Motions for Summary Judgment, Murphy Homes argued that the facts are not \u201cuncontroverted.\u201d Murphy Homes maintained that change orders come from the owner and the architect, not the contractor, and the fact that there were no written change orders is irrelevant as change orders have little or no role in a cost-plus contract. Murphy Homes also argued that Aberle/Muller\u2019s so-called \u201cprofits and general overhead\u201d were actually negotiated rates between the parties as confirmed by the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-8\">\u00b629 The District Court denied all four of Aberle/Muller\u2019s Motions for Summary Judgment during a hearing held to discuss those motions on January 14, 2004. As to Aberle/Muller\u2019s First and Third Motions for Summary Judgment, the court determined that there were material <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>factual issues in dispute, thus summary judgment was not appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"Amm\">\u00b630 Summary judgment is proper only when no genuine issue of material fact exists and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Watkins Trust v. Lacosta, </em>2004 MT 144, \u00b6 16, 321 Mont. 432, \u00b6 16, 92 P.3d 620, \u00b6 16 (citing M. R. Civ. P. 56(c)). Our standard in reviewing a district court's summary judgment ruling is de novo. <em>Watkins Trust, </em>\u00b6 16 (citing <em>Johnson v. Barrett, </em>1999 MT 176, \u00b6 9, 295 Mont. 254, \u00b6 9, 983 P.2d 925, \u00b6 9; <em>Stutzman v. Safeco Ins. Co. of America, </em>284 Mont. 372, 376, 945 P.2d 32, 34 (1997)). We use the same M. R. Civ. P. 56 criteria applied by the district court. <em>Watkins Trust, </em>\u00b6 16 (citing <em>Johnson, </em>\u00b6 9). Moreover, all reasonable inferences which may be drawn from the offered proof must be drawn in favor of the party opposing summary judgment. <em>Watkins Trust, </em>\u00b6 16 (citing <em>Johnson, </em>\u00b6 8; <em>Schmidt v. Washington Contractors Group, </em>1998 MT 194, \u00b6 7, 290 Mont. 276, \u00b6 7, 964 P.2d 34, \u00b6 7). If there is any doubt regarding the propriety of the summary judgment motion, it should be denied. <em>360 Ranch Corp. v. R &amp; D Holding, </em>278 Mont. 487, 491, 926 P.2d 260, 262 (1996) (citing <em>Whitehawk v. Clark, </em>238 Mont. 14, 18, 776 P.2d 484, 486-87 (1989)).</p>\n<p id=\"Amg\">\u00b631 On appeal, Aberle/Muller argue that when the District Court ruled from the bench and denied their Motions for Summary Judgment, the court erred because it did not discuss the law, a specific contract provision, or the testimony, and the court failed to specify what facts appeared without substantial controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">\u00b632 In the Pretrial Order, Aberle/Muller listed 59 issues of disputed facts including: whether Murphy Homes was paid in full under the contract; whether the additional compensation Murphy Homes seeks amounts to nothing more than profit and general overhead and is beyond the expressed permissible scope of Montana hen law; whether the figures Murphy Homes reported and applied for actual labor rates were accurate and/or permissible; whether Murphy Homes is entitled to claim a fee on any project changes not formalized through change orders or change directives as required by the contract; whether Murphy Homes was paid in full as described by the parties\u2019 written contract; and whether Murphy Homes was overpaid under the parties\u2019 written contract. Consequently, by their own representation, the facts relevant to Aberle/Muller\u2019s First and Third Motions for Summary Judgment were not \u201cuncontroverted,\u201d and there were material factual issues in dispute precluding summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">\u00b633 Accordingly, we hold that the District Court did not err in denying Aberle/Muller\u2019s First and Third Motions for Summary Judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>Issue 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">\u00b634 <em>Whether the District Court erred in denying Aberle </em>/ <em>Muller\u2019s Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">\u00b635 On August 3,2004, six days before trial was scheduled to resume in this matter, Aberle/Muller filed their 70-page-long Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law. In their motion, they claimed that the</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-6\">evidence in Plaintiffs case established eight critical facts which entitle Patrick Aberle and Marilyn Muller to judgment as a matter of law:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-7\">a. Patrick Aberle is neither the record owner nor the contacting [sic] owner of the property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-8\">b. Murphy\u2019s claim for equitable adjustment is for additional contractor\u2019s fee, which consists solely of profit and general overhead.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-9\">c. Murphy\u2019s claim for equitable adjustment is <em>not </em>for the payment of unpaid costs of materials or services.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-11\">d. Murphy\u2019s claim is <em>proactive </em>in nature, and not <em>retroactive. </em>Murphy requested additional contractor\u2019s fee for the <em>remainder </em>of the project.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-12\">e. Murphy has already been paid the entire contract price, including <em>all </em>costs of construction as well as its <em>entire </em>contractor\u2019s fee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-13\">f. When Patrick Aberle and Marilyn Muller rejected Murphy\u2019s request for additional contractor\u2019s fee, Murphy walked off the job and abandoned the project without further discussion of costs or renegotiation of the contract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-14\">g. When Murphy abandoned the project, Murphy had been paid all amounts requested in each and every one of its draw requests, including <em>all </em>costs of construction and the <em>entire </em>contractor\u2019s fee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-15\">h. After Murphy abandoned the project, Murphy did not do any farther work. [Emphasis in original.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b445-16\">These eight \u201ccritical facts\u201d were then broken down into 23 Motions for Judgment as a Matter of Law and numerous sub-issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-17\">\u00b636 On appeal, Aberle/Muller argue that the District Court erred in denying their Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law as untimely because under M. R. Civ. P. 50(a)(2), such motions may be made at any time before submission of the case to the jury. While Aberle/Muller are correct in that regard, we note that a District Court has the power to provide for the orderly conduct of proceedings before it and to compel obedience to its judgments, orders, and process. Sections 3-1-111(3) and (4), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>\u00b637 Because of the flurry of motions from both sides during this litigation, the District Court issued an Order on July 28, 2004, that no further motions would be considered except upon leave of court after demonstration of good cause. After Aberle/Muller filed their Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law, the District Court concluded that the motion was untimely both by reference to the court\u2019s scheduling order which required that all pretrial motions were due on or before November 7, 2003, and by the court\u2019s July 28, 2004 Order prohibiting the filing of motions unless good cause had been demonstrated.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">\u00b638 Furthermore, the District Court did not deny Aberle/Muller\u2019s motion simply on the basis of timeliness. In denying Aberle/Muller\u2019s motion, the District Court stated that a variety of the legal issues presented in the motion had been considered before and denied, and other claims for relief demanded by Aberle/Muller involved hotly disputed fact issues which the jury must resolve.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">\u00b639 We review a district court\u2019s order granting or denying a motion for judgment as a matter of law as a legal question for which the de novo or plenary standard of review is appropriate. <em>Johnson v. Costco Wholesale, </em>2007 MT 43, \u00b6 18, 336 Mont. 105, \u00b6 18, 152 P.3d 727, \u00b6 18. Judgment as a matter of law is properly granted only when there is a complete absence of any evidence which would justify submitting an issue to a jury and all such evidence and any legitimate inferences that might be drawn therefrom must be considered in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion. <em>Johnson, </em>\u00b6 13 (citations omitted). Judgment as a matter of law is not proper if reasonable persons could differ regarding conclusions that could be drawn from the evidence. <em>Johnson, </em>\u00b6 13 <em>(citing Kearney v. KXLF Communications, Inc., </em>263 Mont. 407, 417, 869 P.2d 772, 777-78 (1994)). Moreover, as we explained in <em>Johnson, </em>courts should exercise the greatest self-restraint in interfering with the constitutionally mandated processes of a jury decision. <em>Johnson, </em>\u00b6 13 (citing <em>Ryan v. City of Bozeman, </em>279 Mont. 507, 510, 928 P.2d 228, 230 (1996)).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">\u00b640  In reviewing the evidence in a light most favorable to Murphy as we are constrained to do, <em>Johnson, </em>\u00b6 13, we conclude that reasonable persons could differ as to the conclusions that could be drawn from the evidence. Accordingly, we hold that the District Court did not err in denying Aberle/Muller\u2019s Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">Issue 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">\u00b641 <em>Whether the District Court erred in barring Aberle/Muller\u2019s \u201cforeseeability\u201d defense.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b447-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>\u00b642 After Aberle/Muller consumed several hours of trial time with questions about foreseeability, the District Court determined that that doctrine had no place in the lawsuit and ordered Aberle/Muller\u2019s counsel to discontinue asserting it. The corut ruled on the basis that foreseeability had not been pled as \u201cforeseeability for purposes of trying to determine the size of a particular construction contract is not the same as foreseeability from the standpoint of causal relationship in a negligence claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">\u00b643 On appeal, Aberle/Muller contend that they did plead foreseeability. They maintain that in one of their affirmative defenses they argued that if Murphy Homes suffered damages, such damages were the result of its own negligence. However, the words \u201cforeseeable\u201d and \u201cforeseeability\u201d do not appear in any of Aberle/Muller\u2019s pleadings or anywhere in the Pretrial Order. Murphy Homes maintains, and we agree, that the fundamental flaw in Aberle/Muller\u2019s argument is the attempt to apply foreseeability as an element of tort law to a construction project governed by contract. Aberle/Muller are mixing inconsistent legal doctrines in their argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">\u00b644 This Court has repeatedly held that contentions not included in the pretrial order may not be presented at trial. <em>Zimmerman v. Robertson, </em>259 Mont. 105, 111-12, 854 P.2d 338, 342 (1993). M. R. Civ. P. 16(e) provides that a pretrial order controls the subsequent course of the action unless modified by a subsequent order. The purpose of pretrial orders is to prevent surprise, simplify the issues and permit counsel to prepare their case for trial on the basis of the pretrial order. <em>Zimmerman, </em>259 Mont. at 111, 854 P.2d at 342 (citing <em>Workman v. McIntyre Const. Co., </em>190 Mont. 5, 617 P.2d 1281 (1980)). Permitting the introduction of issues first raised during trial would undermine the purposes pretrial orders are intended to serve.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">\u00b645  We conclude in this case that Aberle/Muller did not sufficiently raise the foreseeability issue-even assuming it has any place in this case-prior to trial in either their pleadings or the Pretrial Order. Accordingly, we hold that the District Court did not err in barring Aberle/Muller\u2019s \u201cforeseeability\u201d defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">Issue 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">\u00b646 <em>Whether the District Court erred in denying Aberle /Muller\u2019s Motion to Continue and, instead, ordering a bifurcated trial.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b447-9\">\u00b647 The parties had originally estimated that they would need five days for trial in this matter. However, as discovery progressed and more issues and witnesses were added, the parties requested additional time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>to try the case. The District Court determined that it did not have available on its calendar the two-week period the parties requested for trial until February 2005, more than a year away. Consequently, the court decided to bifurcate the trial on the basis that it would be unfair to require Murphy Homes to wait an additional year to try their case.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">\u00b648 Aberle/Muller objected, but their Motion to Continue was denied by the District Court. On January 21, 2004, Aberle/Muller filed an Application for Writ of Supervisory Control or Other Appropriate Relief with this Court (Supreme Court Cause No. 04-053) wherein they sought an order requiring the District Court to reset the trial to a time when the case could be tried to final verdict at one time, without bifurcation or interruption. We denied Aberle/Muller\u2019s application and the case proceeded to trial on January 26, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">\u00b649 After five days, Murphy Homes had not completed its case in chief, consequently, the District Court rearranged its court calendar to provide two more days for trial. Nevertheless, when, after seven days, Aberle/Muller had only begun to present their defense, the District Court ordered that the trial resume at an unspecified time in the future. The court warned that it could be as much as six months before the court found an opening in its busy trial schedule and it ordered the parties to provide the court with a fist of dates that they were not available.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">\u00b650 One month after the first portion of the trial in this case concluded, the District Court found it had time in its calendar to resume the trial as another case had settled. Thus, on March 2, 2004, the District Court ordered that trial resume on March 9,2004. Aberle/Muller objected and on March 5, 2004, they filed an Emergency Petition for Writ of Supervisory Control or Other Appropriate Relief with this Court (Supreme Court Cause No. 04-148) wherein they requested that this Court order the District Court to vacate the trial dates set for March 9, 10, and 12,2004, and to continue the trial to a date that provides at least thirty days notice to counsel and the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">\u00b651 We granted Aberle/Muller\u2019s petition and ordered the District Court to provide counsel with a minimum of thirty days notice of new continuation dates. In response to this Court\u2019s Order, the District Court filed a Memorandum with this Court explaining the problems it had encountered with scheduling a trial date in this case. The District Court also noted that it is not always possible to know thirty days in advance if another case will settle and thereby free up some days on the court\u2019s calendar allowing the court to resume trial in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-8\">\u00b652 On March 26, 2004, the District Court reset trial to April 27,2004, but once again, Aberle/Muller objected contending that that date <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>conflicted with a trial in federal court in which counsel was involved. The District Court again vacated trial and imposed sanctions against Aberle/Muller\u2019s counsel for failing to keep the court informed of his availability. The court reset trial for August 9, 10 and 11, 2004, noting that if other earlier dates became available with at least thirty days notice, the court would order trial to commence then.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\">\u00b653 On July 15,2004, the District Court applied to this Court for relief from our March 5,2004 Order requiring the District Court to give thirty days notice to the parties before trial recommenced in this case. The court noted that \u201c[e]fficient administration of the District Court calendar and any hope of concluding the trial of this case requires that discretion be vested in the District Court to schedule all cases for trial, including this one.\u201d Hence, the court requested that we amend our Order to require that it provide \u201creasonable notice\u201d to the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">\u00b654 Recognizing that the District Court had made every attempt to comply with our March 5, 2004 Order and to accommodate Aberle/Muller, but without success, we amended our Order on July 27, 2004, to require that the District Court provide reasonable notice to the parties for all purposes after August 9, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">\u00b655 Aberle/Muller now argue on appeal that the delay in the resumption of the trial in this case worked to their disadvantage because Murphy Homes\u2019 case remained unrebutted for months and cemented Murphy Homes\u2019 case in the juror\u2019s minds. However, contrary to Aberle/Muller\u2019s opinion, it is just as likely that the jurors forgot key aspects of Murphy Homes\u2019 case in the interim thereby putting Murphy Homes at a disadvantage. Moreover, part of the fault for the delay in resuming this case lies with Aberle/Muller and their counsel as the facts set forth above demonstrate.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">\u00b656 Nevertheless, this Court already decided the issue of the correctness of a bifurcated trial when we denied Aberle/Muller\u2019s Application for Writ of Supervisory Control or Other Appropriate Relief (Supreme Court Cause No. 04-053) in January 2004. Under the law of the case doctrine, a prior decision of this Court resolving an issue between the same parties is binding and may not be relitigated. <em>Muri v.

Murphy Homes explained that because Aberle/Muber were alleging numerous construction defects, such a tour would enhance the ability of the jurors to understand the areas of the house involved and to see the specific features in dispute. At first, Aberle/Muber did not object to the motion for the tour, but they later argued and now argue on appeal, that the sole purpose of the tour was to see their affluence and to prejudice the jury against them.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">\u00b660  The decision to permit or deny a jury view of the property in question is left to the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>McJunkin v. Kaufman &amp; Broad Home Systems, </em>229 Mont. 432, 446, 748 P.2d 910, 919 (1987); <em>see also McGinley v.

A district court abuses its discretion when it acts arbitrarily, without employment of conscientious judgment, or in excess of the bounds of reason resulting in substantial injustice. <em>Whipps v.

Accordingly, we hold that the District Court was acting within its discretion in abowing the jury to view the residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-10\">\u00b662 In addition, because both parties sought punitive damages, the District Cotut ordered that the parties file sworn financial statements disclosing their net worth. In response, Aberle/Muber filed a sworn statement showing a joint net worth of more than $665,000.00. Earher, as part of discovery prior to trial, Murphy Homes had requested that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>Aberle/Muller produce any financial statements filed at a financial institution since January 1,2000. Aberle/Muller responded that they had not filed any such financial statements. However, during the six month recess in the trial, Murphy Homes obtained authorization from the court to subpoena a loan file at Wells Fargo Bank of Helena in which the joint financial statement of Aberle/Muller showed their net worth at $4.6 million, almost $4 million more than indicated on the sworn financial statement they had submitted to the court. Upon receipt of this information, Murphy Homes moved for sanctions for discovery fraud in the form of vacating the trial; entering summary judgment for Murphy Homes; awarding Murphy Homes monetary damages of $134,000.00 plus interest; and dismissing all of Aberle/Muller\u2019s counterclaims.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\">\u00b663 When trial resumed in this matter, the District Court allowed Murphy Homes to introduce Aberle/Muller\u2019s inconsistent financial statements and prevented Aberle/Muller from refuting that evidence. Aberle/Muller asserts on appeal that the District Court erred by admitting evidence of their financial condition on the issue of liability. Aberle/Muller rely on \u00a7 27-1-221(7)(a), MCA, which provides in pertinent part: \u201cEvidence regarding a defendant\u2019s financial affairs, financial condition, and net worth is not admissible in a trial to determine whether a defendant is liable for punitive damages.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">\u00b664 The court initially allowed evidence of Aberle/Muller\u2019s financial condition to impeach statements made by Aberle/Muller during their direct testimony. \u201c[I]t is axiomatic that a witness may be cross-examined on any subject raised or fact stated on direct examination.\u201d <em>Hando v.

Aberle testified to the fact that Muller had to reduce her work schedule thereby losing a year\u2019s salary. On cross examination, Murphy Homes\u2019 counsel asked Aberle to quantify Muller\u2019s loss of income and Aberle testified that the loss was $300,000.00, a \u201csubstantial amount of money.\u201d Counsel then referred to the Wells Fargo financial statements indicating that during the time in question, Muller\u2019s income had actually increased. \u00b666 The District Court allowed additional testimony regarding Aberle/Muller\u2019s financial condition as a sanction for Aberle/Muller\u2019s failure to comply with the court\u2019s order to file accurate financial statements and their failure to provide Murphy Homes with the information it had requested during discovery. Our standard of review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>of sanctions imposed under M. R. Civ. P. 37, is whether the district court abused its discretion. <em>Maloney v.

Our position is that dilatory abuse of discovery must no longer be dealt with leniently and that the transgressors of discovery abuses should be punished rather than repeatedly encouraged to cooperate. <em>Maloney, </em>\u00b6 34. Consequently, we regard with favor the imposition of sanctions for failure to comply with discovery. <em>Richardson, </em>\u00b6 56 (citing <em>Schuff v. A.T.

A more careful response would be to punish Aberle/Muller by allowing Murphy Homes to use Aberle/Muller\u2019s discovery error against them. Murphy Homes could be allowed in their principal case to introduce otherwise impermissible evidence of financial statements to draw the jury\u2019s attention to Aberle/Muller\u2019s inconsistent statement. Obviously, Murphy Homes would then be allowed to argue that inconsistency to its advantage.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">\u00b671  Accordingly, we hold that the District Court did not err as Aberle/Muller\u2019s inconsistent financial statements came into evidence as proper impeachment on cross-examination and as a sanction for Aberle/Muller\u2019s discovery abuses.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">Issue 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-9\">\u00b672 <em>Whether the District Court erred in refusing Aberle/Muller\u2019s proposed jury instructions.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b453-10\">\u00b67 3 Aberle/Muller argue that the District Court erred in refusing to give their proposed jury instructions that relied on cases from the United States Court of Federal Claims.

Lee, </em>2000 MT 67, \u00b6 66, 299 Mont. 78, \u00b6 66, 996 P.2d 389, \u00b6 66 (citing <em>In re Marriage of Moss, </em>1999 MT 62, \u00b6 41, 293 Mont. 500, \u00b6 41, 977 P.2d 322, \u00b6 41).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-11\">\u00b691 As we noted throughout this Opinion, Aberle/Muller made numerous errors in filing their brief on appeal. In an attempt to circumvent this Court\u2019s page limitations, Aberle/Muller included information in an appendix to their brief that should have been included in the brief itself and they improperly asked this Court to adopt and incorporate by reference into their brief more than 200 pages of facts; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>citations to deposition and trial testimony; authorities; and argument contained in their numerous filings before the District Court. In addition, their brief was convoluted and confusing as their fist of eleven issues did not correspond in any meaningful way to the more than 29 contentions they set forth in the argument portion of their brief. Further, their brief is dominated by bald declarations of error by the District Court with little or no substantiation.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">\u00b692 As noted previously in this Opinion, M. R. App. P. 23(a)(4) \u201crequires that an appellant present a concise, cohesive argument which \u2018contain[s] the contentions of the appellant with respect to the issues presented, and the reasons therefore, with citations to the authorities, statutes and pages of the record relied on.\u2019 \u201d <em>McMahon, </em>\u00b6 6. Many of the errors Aberle/Muller made on appeal could have been avoided had they attempted to weed out and substantiate legitimate issues rather than using a \u201cshotgun\u201d approach to attempt to hit every conceivable issue, viable or not, and then failing to support those issues with proper analysis and legal authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">\u00b693  We are satisfied from the record and the presentation of the appeal in this matter that Aberle/Muller proceeded here without respect for the integrity of the judicial process, and did so without sufficient reasonable grounds. We therefore conclude that pursuant to M. R. App. P. 32, Murphy Homes\u2019 request for attorney's fees and costs in defending this appeal is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">\u00b694 The judgment of the District Court is affirmed and this matter is remanded to the District Court for the sole purpose of determining the attorney's fees and costs associated with this appeal and the entry of an award of those fees and costs in Murphy Homes\u2019 favor.</p>\n<judges id=\"b457-7\">JUSTICES LEAPHART, WARNER, RICE and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b455-8\"> The \u201cPrompt Payment Act,\u201d as referred to by the parties, is found at Title 28, Chapter 2, Part 21, MCA, and is actually entitled \u201cPayment of Construction Contractors and Subcontractors.\u201d Among other things, this act provides for interest of <em>VA% </em>a month on any unpaid balance under a construction contract.
