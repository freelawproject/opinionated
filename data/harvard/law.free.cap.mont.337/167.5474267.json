Jones, Lori Jones, Robert Clark, and Leslie Clark (hereafter referred to either individually or collectively as Respondents) did not breach the 1998 Settlement Agreement (Settlement Agreement) between the parties. Respondents further cross-appeal on various issues. We affirm in part, reverse in part and remand for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">\u00b62 Byrums raise the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court err when it ruled Respondents did not breach the Settlement Agreement?</p>\n<p id=\"b195-9\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court err when it ordered M. R. Civ. P. 11 (Rule 11) sanctions against Byrums?</p>\n<p id=\"b195-10\">\u00b65 3. Did the District Court err when it allowed Robert Clark to testify concerning issues outside the pretrial order?</p>\n<p id=\"b195-11\">\u00b66 We restate the following issues on cross-appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b195-12\">\u00b67 4. Did the District Court err in dismissing Respondents\u2019 counterclaims?</p>\n<p id=\"b195-13\">\u00b68 5. Did the District Court err in failing to award attorney\u2019s fees and costs to Respondents under \u00a7 70-17-112(5), MCA?</p>\n<p id=\"b195-14\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b195-15\">\u00b69 The parties in this case each own property along or near the Jefferson River in Madison County, Montana. Byrums\u2019 property contains an irrigation ditch known as the Old Dutch Ditch (Ditch). The Ditch diverts water from the Jefferson River to the Respondents\u2019 respective properties for the purposes of irrigation and other beneficial uses. Byrums moved onto their property in 1993 and have no rights to the water conveyed by the Ditch. The Ditch has been in use for the benefit of Respondents and the previous owners of Respondents\u2019 properties since the 1950\u2019s. The existence, uses, and functions of the Ditch have remained largely unchanged since that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-16\">\u00b610 In 1995-two years after Byrums had moved to their property-Andrens, Clarks, and Browns (Browns were original parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>to this lawsuit, but were eventually dismissed) commenced litigation against Byrums over the use and maintenance of the Ditch. The parties settled the 1995 litigation and executed the Settlement Agreement in an attempt to define the rights and duties of the parties with respect to the Ditch. In the Settlement Agreement, Byrums expressly recognized the rights of Respondents to the water rights, ditch rights, and secondary easement rights to the Ditch. Additionally, as the District Court paraphrased in its findings of fact and conclusions of law, the Settlement Agreement obligated Respondents to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-4\">a. Rebuild the dike/levee structure and install two new steel culvert pipes with \u201cadequate closing headgates\u201d;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-5\">b. Level the top of the dike/levee to allow vehicle access;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-6\">c. Use \u201creasonable and prudent caution\u201d in the installation of the culvert pipes;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-7\">d. Utilize \u201creasonable means\u201d to assure that the dike/levee does not leak;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-8\">e. Provide Byrums reasonable notice of at least two weeks, when repairs to the [Ditch] and irrigation apparatus are necessary, unless the repairs are an \u201cemergency\u201d;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-9\">f. Exercise their access, operation, maintenance, and repair rights in accord with their secondary easement rights and in accord with Montana law; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-10\">g. Install a measuring device in the Ditch on Byrums\u2019 property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AMB\">Moreover, the Settlement Agreement required that \u201cByrums agree that they shall not interfere with [Respondents\u2019] reasonable use of their water rights, ditch rights, and exercise of their secondary easement rights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b196-11\">\u00b611 The Settlement Agreement was agreed to and adopted by the parties in 1998. Byrums initiated the present litigation against Respondents in 2002. Byrums alleged in their Complaint that Respondents had breached the terms of the Settlement Agreement, created a nuisance, and trespassed onto their property. Byrums\u2019 claim of trespass was dismissed shortly before trial. In response, Respondents counterclaimed against Byrums, alleging breach of the Settlement Agreement, interference with their water rights, primary easements, and secondary easements to the Ditch, nuisance, and violation of \u00a7 85-1-111, MCA, which provides that \u201c[t]he right of any person ... to take and use any water ... from any stream or streams for the purpose of irrigation or any beneficial or industrial pursuit shall not be abridged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b197-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>\u00b612 A trial was held on July 22, 23, and 24, 2003, by the District Court, sitting without a jury. On January 26, 2004, the District Court issued its Findings, Conclusions, and Decree. The court found that Byrums\u2019 allegations were without merit and in addition, awarded Rule 11 sanctions against Byrums to Respondents. Furthermore, the District Court found all of Respondents counterclaims \u201cunfounded\u201d and dismissed all counterclaims with prejudice. Byrums appeal and Respondents cross-appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">\u00b613 Additional facts will be discussed where relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">\u00b614 We review the findings of a district court sitting without a jury to determine if the court\u2019s findings were clearly erroneous. <em>See </em>M. R. Civ. P. 52(a). A district court\u2019s findings are clearly erroneous if substantial credible evidence does not support them, if the district court has misapprehended the effect of the evidence or if a review of the record leaves this Court with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed. <em>Ray v. Nansel, </em>2002 MT 191, \u00b6 19, 311 Mont. 135, \u00b6 19, 53 P.3d 870, \u00b6 19. Additionally, we must view the evidence in the fight most favorable to the prevailing party when determining whether substantial credible evidence supports the district court\u2019s findings. <em>Ray, </em>\u00b6 19. We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether those conclusions are correct. <em>In re Estate of Harms, </em>2006 MT 320, \u00b6 12, 335 Mont. 66, \u00b6 12, 149 P.3d 557, \u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">\u00b615 We review a district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings for an abuse of discretion. <em>McDermott v. Carie, LLC, </em>2005 MT 293, \u00b6 10, 329 Mont. 295, \u00b6 10, 124 P.3d 168, \u00b6 10 (citing <em>Busta v. Columbus Hosp. Corp., </em>276 Mont. 342, 353, 916 P.2d 122, 128 (1996)). Absent a showing of such abuse we will not overturn a district court\u2019s ruling on the admissibility of evidence. <em>McDermott, </em>\u00b6 10 (citing <em>Christofferson v. City of Great Falls, </em>2003 MT 189, \u00b6 8, 316 Mont. 469, \u00b6 8, 74 P.3d 1021, \u00b6 8). A district court abuses its discretion if its acts \u201carbitrarily without employment of conscientious judgment or exceed[s] the bounds of reason resulting in substantial injustice.\u201d <em>McDermott, </em>\u00b6 10 (citing <em>VonLutzow v. Leppek, </em>2003 MT 214, \u00b6 14, 317 Mont. 109, \u00b6 14, 75 P.3d 782, \u00b6 14).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">\u00b616 With regard to the sanctions issue, Rule 11 provides, in pertinent part that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-9\">The signature of an attorney or party constitutes a certificate by the signer that the signer has read the pleading, motion, or other paper; that to the best of the signer\u2019s knowledge, information, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>belief formed after reasonable inquiry it is well grounded in fact and is warranted by existing law or a good faith argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law, and that it is not interposed for any improper purpose, such as to harass or to cause unnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of litigation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-4\">If a pleading, motion, or other paper is signed in violation of this rule, the court, upon motion or upon its own initiative, shall impose upon the person who signed it, a represented party, or both, an appropriate sanction, which may include an order to pay to the other party or parties the amount of the reasonable expenses incurred because of the filing of the pleading, motion, or other paper, including a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">\u00b617 Our standard of review with respect to the imposition of Rule 11 sanctions has been consistently stated as follows: <em>\u201ca </em>district court\u2019s findings of fact will be overturned if clearly erroneous, and <em>a court\u2019s legal conclusion that the facts constitute a violation of Rule 11 will be reversed if the determination constitutes an abuse of discretion.\u201d Brandt v. Sande, </em>2000 MT 98, \u00b6 35, 299 Mont. 256, \u00b6 35, 1 P.3d 929, \u00b6 35 (citing <em>D\u2019Agostino v. Swanson, </em>240 Mont. 435, 446, 784 P.2d 919, 926 (1990) (emphasis added). Moreover, \u201c[w]e will review the case de novo only if the violation is based on the legal sufficiency of a plea or motion\u201d <em>Brandt, </em>\u00b6 35, (citing D\u2019Agostino, 240 Mont. at 446, 784 P.2d at 926).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In closely examining the language of this standard of review, however, we conclude that the proper standard of review is not correctly stated in the foregoing decisions. Accordingly, we take this opportunity to clarify and re-state our standard of review in Rule 11 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\">\u00b618 The foregoing statement of our standard of review was adopted in <em>D\u2019Agostino </em>and was constructed as one which \u201ccombines the standards utilized by the federal courts.\u201d <em>D\u2019Agostino, </em>240 Mont. at 446, 784 P.2d at 926.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Unfortunately, in articulating this composite rule it is apparent that the <em>D\u2019Agostino </em>Court conflated our review of the district court\u2019s <em>legal conclusion </em>that the facts constitute a violation of the Rule (to which a de novo standard of review applies) with the district court\u2019s <em>choice of sanction </em>once the violation is found (a choice which we review for abuse of discretion). <em>D\u2019Agostino, </em>240 Mont. at 446, 784 P.2d at 926. That part of the standard which reads a \u201ccourt\u2019s legal conclusion that the facts constitute a violation of Rule 11 will be reversed if the determination constitutes an abuse of discretion\u201d is simply incorrect. A court\u2019s legal conclusions are not reversed for abuse of discretion; they are reversed if they are wrong. <em>Harms, </em>\u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">\u00b619  Therefore, clarifying and restating the standard set forth in <em>D\u2019Agostino, </em>our standard of review of a district court\u2019s decision to grant or deny sanctions under Rule 11, henceforth will be as follows: we review de novo the district court\u2019s determination that the pleading, motion or other paper violates Rule 11. We review the district court\u2019s findings of fact underlying that conclusion to determine whether such findings are clearly erroneous. If the court determines that Rule 11 was violated, then we review the district court\u2019s choice of sanction for abuse of discretion. The cases cited above in \u00b6 17 and in <em>supra </em>note 1 are likewise clarified to the extent they cite a different standard of review.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"A_a\">Issue 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">\u00b620 <em>Did the District Court err when it determined Respondents did not breach the Settlement Agreement?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">\u00b621 This Court has previously determined that settlement agreements are contracts, subject to the provisions of contract law. <em>Dambrowski v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number><em>Champion Intern. Corp., </em>2003 MT 233, \u00b6 9, 317 Mont. 218, \u00b6 9, 76 P.3d 1080, \u00b6 9. The District Court concluded that Respondents did not breach the Settlement Agreement. Byrums argue that Respondents, having joint and several liability to fulfill the obligations set forth in the Settlement Agreement, breached the terms of the Settlement Agreement and that the District Court erred in not so finding. Byrums make specific arguments in respect to separate obligations set forth in the Settlement Agreement. We will discuss those arguments in turn and, as already noted, we will review whether substantial credible evidence exists to support the District Court\u2019s findings and whether such findings are clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">\u00b622 First, Byrums assert that Respondents failed to install adequate closing headgates pursuant to the first obligation of the Settlement Agreement. Byrums point to Admin. R. M. 36.13.101(9), which requires a headgate \u201cto regulate the amount of water being diverted\u201d and \u201c[to] be capable of being closed completely and to adequately vary the amount of water diverted into a ditch.\u201d Byrums contend Respondents installed headgates that leaked and thus, Respondents violated the terms of the Settlement Agreement. In response, Respondents point to testimony at trial that indicates the headgate installations were adequate. Respondents further point out that most, if not all, headgates will leak some water when water levels rise. Respondents conclude that the evidence elicited at trial supports the District Court\u2019s finding that adequate headgates were installed to control the flow of water from the Jefferson River into the Ditch.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">\u00b623 The District Court made the following findings of fact in reaching its conclusion that the headgates were properly operated and adequately controlled the flow of water into the Ditch: that Respondents had purchased and installed an R-5 style headgate, which is customarily used by irrigators; that the R-5 headgate installed by Respondents leaked, but that R-5 headgates commonly leak and that any leaking here was minimal without posing any risks to property; and that the headgates freely opened and closed as desired. Moreover, testimony at trial supported the District Court\u2019s findings. For example, testimony indicates that the R-5 headgate is the only type of headgate that would have worked on the Ditch. Furthermore, Respondents\u2019 expert, Tom Miller, testified that R-5 headgates commonly leak, that any leaks on account of the headgates are minimal, and that the headgate in question was properly installed. Thus, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the court\u2019s finding and that finding is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>\u00b624 Next, Byrums allege Respondents violated the Settlement Agreement by not properly installing a measuring device pursuant to the terms of the Settlement Agreement. Byrums explain that because irrigation water rights are measured by flow rates, the required measuring device must measure flow rates and not merely the depth of the ditch water. Byrums point out that the measuring device installed by Respondents measures only the depth of the water in the ditch, not flow rate, and therefore does not meet the requirements of the Settlement Agreement. Respondents respond that a measuring device was installed pursuant to the terms of the Settlement Agreement (which does not expressly require a device that measured flow rates) and that Byrums have proven no damages by the use of the measuring device.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">\u00b625 The District Court found that Respondents did install a measuring device and that Byrums presented no evidence that Respondents\u2019 installation and use of the measuring device caused any damages. The court thus concluded that Respondents properly installed and used a measuring device in accordance with the Settlement Agreement. Testimony from trial indicates that Respondents installed the device, but ceased use of the device in 2002 as this litigation had begun. Respondents made this decision on the advice of their legal counsel. Nothing in the record indicates that Byrums were damaged after the measuring device was uninstalled. Thus, the court\u2019s finding is supported by substantial evidence and is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">\u00b626 Byrums further allege that Respondents breached another obligation of the Settlement Agreement-that the Ditch be used in accordance with Montana law. Specifically, Byrums argue that because Respondents exceeded their water rights without putting their diverted water to beneficial use, Respondents damaged Byrums\u2019 property by eroding the Ditch, widening the Ditch, and flooding Byrums\u2019 property. Respondents, on the other hand, assert the Ditch was properly operated and maintained, that the Ditch has not significantly changed in the last 44 years, and that the water diverted in the Ditch was only the amount needed for Respondents\u2019 beneficial uses.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">\u00b627  The District Court determined that Respondents have accessed, operated, maintained, and repaired the Ditch pursuant to Montana law. Furthermore, the court found that Byrums\u2019 claim that Respondents were using excessive water was unfounded. In so deciding, the District Court made the following findings of fact: that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>the water being diverted by Respondents was put to beneficial use without waste; that the water diverted by Respondents was properly regulated in quantity; that Respondents have reasonably maintained the Ditch; that Respondents have not exceeded their water rights; and that the Ditch has not been eroded or appreciably changed over the last several decades. Testimony from trial supports the District Court\u2019s findings. In particular, Paul Andren testified that in his use of the Ditch, he did not divert more water than necessary or waste any water. L.W. Jones also testified to this effect. Evidence in the record shows that the quantity of water flowing through the property of Byrums was within the amount necessary to irrigate their lands. Other testimony indicates that the Ditch has not been substantially eroded and that Respondents have made efforts to maintain the Ditch as contemplated by the Settlement Agreement, such as removing obstructions like beaver dams. Again, substantial evidence supports the District Court\u2019s findings and they are not clearly erroneous on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">\u00b628  Having thus concluded that the District Court\u2019s findings of fact in relation to Byrums\u2019 claim are supported by substantial credible evidence and are not clearly erroneous, we hold that the District Court correctly concluded that Respondents did not breach the Settlement Agreement. We affirm the District Court\u2019s decision in that regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">Issue 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">\u00b629 <em>Did the District Court err when it ordered Rule 11 sanctions against Byrums?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">\u00b630 The District Court determined that Byrums\u2019 \u201clawsuit was so strongly without merit it was frivolous.\u201d In its January 26, 2004 order wherein the court imposed Rule 11 sanctions against the Byrums, the court stated the Byrums had \u201cunnecessarily forced\u201d Respondents into court \u201cto defend their rights and interests in the [Ditch.]\u201d Thus, the court ordered Byrums to pay, as a sanction, each Respondent\u2019s costs and attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">\u00b631 Accordingly, we review the District Court\u2019s decision under the standard set forth in \u00b6 19. Specifically, we review de novo the District Court\u2019s determination that the pleading, motion or other paper violates Rule 11. We review the District Court\u2019s findings of fact underlying that conclusion to determine whether such findings are clearly erroneous. If the court determines that Rule 11 was violated, we review the District Court\u2019s choice of sanction for abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-9\">\u00b632 The purpose of Rule 11 is to \u201cdiscourage dilatory or abusive tactics and help to streamline the litigation process by lessening frivolous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>claims or defenses.\u201d <em>Brandt, </em>\u00b6 35 <em>(citing D\u2019Agostino, </em>240 Mont. at 444, 784 P.2d at 925). We have noted that \u201cMontana\u2019s Rule 11 is similar in many respects to the federal rule.\u201d <em>Brandt, </em>\u00b6 35. Before a district court may impose sanctions pursuant to Rule 11, it must conduct a hearing for that purpose. <em>Stipe v. First Interstate Bank of Poison, </em>2005 MT 295, \u00b6 20, 329 Mont. 320, \u00b6 20, 125 P.3d 591, \u00b6 20; <em>Muri v. Frank, </em>2003 MT 316, \u00b6 22, 318 Mont. 269, \u00b6 22, 80 P.3d 77, \u00b6 22; <em>State v. Toole County, </em>278 Mont. 253, 263, 924 P.2d 693, 698 (1996); <em>Lindey\u2019s Inc. v. Goodover, </em>264 Mont. 489, 497, 872 P.2d 767, 772 (1994). District courts must give notice to the party it proposes to sanction and hold a hearing on whether Rule 11 sanctions are proper. This hearing must take place before Rule 11 sanctions are imposed, so that the party the district court proposes to sanction \u201cwill be provided with due process before it is punished.\u201d <em>Stipe, </em>\u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">\u00b633 Here, the District Court, in its January 26, 2004 order, declared that Rule 11 sanctions would be imposed against the Byrums for the \u201cfiling of a frivolous and unwarranted Complaint and First Amended Complaint not grounded in fact.\u201d The court set a hearing for March 22, 2004, for the purpose of determining the proper amount of Rule 11 sanctions to be imposed against Byrums. All Respondents submitted statements of costs and attorney\u2019s fees, and Byrums submitted a brief in opposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">\u00b634 The District Court properly followed the due process requirements in respect to Rule 11 as laid out in the <em>Lindey\u2019s Inc., Toole County, Muri, </em>and <em>Stipe </em>line of cases. The court gave notice to the Byrums that Rule 11 sanctions would be imposed in the January 26, 2004 order. Moreover, a hearing was held on March 22, 2004, to address the issue of Rule 11 sanctions. The District Court complied with all of the requirements set forth in <em>Lindey\u2019s Inc.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">\u00b635 Byrums nonetheless argue the District Court\u2019s order imposing Rule 11 sanctions should be reversed for its failure to make specific findings of fact. Byrums cite to a decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, <em>Akin v. Q-L Investments, Inc., </em>959 F.2d 521 (5th Cir. 1992), in support of their argument. The court in <em>Akin </em>stated that in cases where \u201cthe sanctions imposed are substantial in amount, type, or effect,\u201d the \u201cdistrict court must enter specific factual findings to assist the appellate court in its review of the Rule 11 sanctions.\u201d <em>Akin, </em>959 F.2d at 535. The court also explained that a district court \u201cmust impose the \u2018least severe sanction adequate\u2019 to accomplish the purposes of Rule 11.\u201d <em>Akin, </em>959 F.2d at 535 (citing <em>Thomas v. Capital Sec. Services, Inc., </em>836 F.2d 866, 878 (5th Cir. 1988) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>(en banc)). In reversing a Rule 11 sanction, the court explained \u201c[t]he [district] court did not indicate in the record the factors it considered in choosing a [ ] sanction\u201d and \u201cdid not state in the record which alternative sanctions, if any, it also considered.\u201d The court concluded that because of the substantial size of the Rule 11 sanction involved, it \u201cmay not affirm the sanction until the district court has entered specific factual findings determining whether the sanction is the least severe adequate to serve the purposes of Rule 11.\u201d <em>Akin, </em>959 F.2d at 535.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">\u00b636 We agree with Byrums and find persuasive the reasoning of the Fifth Circuit as applied to the case at bar. Here, the District Court made no findings of fact as to why it issued Rule 11 sanctions against Byrums. Rather, the court merely entered a conclusion of law that Byrums\u2019 \u201clawsuit was so strongly without merit it was frivolous.\u201d Without more and, applying our own standard of review, we are unable to conclude that the District Court correctly concluded, as a matter of law, that the Byrums\u2019 pleadings, motions and other papers violated Rule 11, because we are unable to review any findings of fact in support of the District Court\u2019s determination in that regard. That being the case, we are also unable to review the District Court\u2019s choice of sanction for abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">\u00b637  As did the Court of Appeals in <em>Akin, </em>we hold that, here, the District Court\u2019s order granting Rule 11 sanctions against Byrums must be vacated. We remand to the District Court for further proceedings as are determined to be necessary by the court and for entry of specific factual findings in support of its determination on whether the Byrums violated Rule 11 and, if so, as to the appropriateness of the choice of the sanction imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">Issue 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">\u00b638 <em>Did the District Court err when it allowed Robert Clark to testify concerning issues outside the pretrial order </em>?</p>\n<p id=\"b204-8\">\u00b639 Byrums allege the District Court erred in allowing Robert Clark to testify regarding matters outside of the pretrial order. Rule 5(c) of the Uniform District Court Rules requires a pretrial order to include a statement that the pretrial order supersedes the pleadings and governs the subsequent course of trial. <em>Craig v. Schell, </em>1999 MT 40, \u00b6 44, 293 Mont. 323, \u00b6 44, 975 P.2d 820, \u00b6 44. Moreover, M. R. Civ. P. 16(e) explicitly provides that the pretrial order controls the subsequent course of the action. <em>Craig, </em>\u00b6 44 (citations omitted). That said, we have also stated that a district court possesses wide discretion in deciding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>whether to allow a party to raise a factual issue or legal theory not explicitly raised in the pretrial order, but the court must be mindful not to prejudice the parties. <em>Hjartarson v. Hjartarson, </em>2006 MT 273, \u00b6 33, 334 Mont. 212, \u00b6 33, 147 P.3d 164, \u00b6 33 (citing <em>Nentwig v. United Industry, Inc., </em>256 Mont. 134, 139, 845 P.2d 99, 103 (1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">\u00b640 At trial, Clark testified to several issues which were not included in the pretrial order adopted by the parties and the District Court. The testimony at issue included events surrounding legal actions that had taken place prior to the Settlement Agreement between the Byrums and Respondents. Counsel for Byrums objected to this testimony and moved to strike the testimony in question from the record. The District Court overruled Byrums\u2019 objection and motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">\u00b641 As stated above, we review the District Court\u2019s evidentiary rulings for an abuse of discretion. <em>McDermott, </em>\u00b6 10 (citation omitted). Although Clark\u2019s testimony regarding past incidents with the Byrums may not have been relevant to the issues set out in the pretrial order, the record also shows that Byrums failed to demonstrate any prejudice from the court\u2019s decision to allow Clark to testify on matters that were outside of the pretrial order. <em>Hjartarson, </em>\u00b6 33. Therefore, we conclude that while the court may have abused its discretion in admitting Clark\u2019s testimony, the court\u2019s error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">Issue 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">\u00b642 <em>Did the District Court err in dismissing Respondents\u2019 counterclaims ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">\u00b643 Each Respondent separately alleged counterclaims against the Byrums for interference with ditch rights and breach of the Settlement Agreement. Andrens and Clarks additionally alleged counterclaims on other issues. The District Court dismissed all of Respondents\u2019 counterclaims, concluding that Respondents\u2019 allegations were unfounded. The District Court made limited findings of fact in regard to the counterclaims-generically that: (1) Byrums did not get along with Respondents and vice versa; (2) testimony revealed childlike behavior between the parties; (3) Byrums had not denied Respondents access to the headgate; (4) Byrums had not prevented water from being conveyed down the Ditch; and (5) Byrums had not attempted to operate the headgate.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-9\">\u00b644 Although Respondents each filed separate briefs with regard to their respective counterclaims and cross-appeals, we will first address their claims of interference with ditch rights and breach of the Settlement Agreement arguments together. We will then separately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>address Andrens\u2019 and Clarks\u2019 additional counterclaims.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">\n<em>Respondents\u2019 Interference with Ditch Rights Counterclaim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AqP\">\u00b645 Respondents claim the District Court erred in dismissing their counterclaims against Byrums for interference with their ditch rights. Respondents point to \u00a7 70-17-112(1), MCA, which states that \u201c[a] person with a canal or ditch easement has a secondary easement to enter, inspect, repair, and maintain a canal or ditch.\u201d Additionally, \u00a7 70-17-112(2), MCA, states that \u201c[n]o person may encroach upon or otherwise impair any easement for a canal or ditch used for irrigation or any other lawful... purpose.\u201d Respondents argue that they have not been able to check or maintain the Ditch without interference from Byrums. This interference, as Respondents allege, came in two forms.</p>\n<p id=\"Ase\">\u00b646  First, Respondents allege physical interference, namely that Byrums had continually confronted Respondents while they attempted to maintain the Ditch, blocked Respondents from accessing the headgate, and verbally harassed Respondents. The District Court found that the Byrums had not denied Respondents access to the headgate and had not prevented water from being conveyed down the Ditch. Testimony from trial indicates that the Byrums did occasionally block Respondents from using the headgates on the Ditch, but that the Byrums eventually allowed access. Evidence in the record supports the District Court\u2019s finding that Byrums did not physically deny Respondents\u2019 access to the headgate. The court\u2019s finding is supported by substantial evidence and is not clearly erroneous in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"Aqu\">\u00b647 Second, Respondents allege the filing of the underlying lawsuit to this appeal interfered with Respondents\u2019 legal right to the use of the Ditch, and has prevented their maintaining the headgate. Respondents cite to <em>Kephart v. Portmann, </em>259 Mont. 232, 855 P.2d 120 (1993), in support of their argument. <em>Kephart </em>involved a situation similar to the dispute here. The defendants there possessed an easement across plaintiffs\u2019 property for the use of a ditch. The easement allowed defendants to clean and maintain the ditch. Plaintiffs sought to enjoin defendants from maintaining and improving the ditch. <em>Kephart, </em>259 Mont. at 234-35, 855 P.2d at 121-22. The plaintiffs in <em>Kephart </em>had acknowledged the existence of the defendants\u2019 right to use the ditch based on a prior agreement between the parties and based on defendants\u2019 prior use of the ditch. <em>Kephart, </em>259 Mont. at 236, 855 P.2d at 123. We affirmed the district court\u2019s determination that the defendants rightfully possessed a ditch easement over the plaintiffs\u2019 property, <em>Kephart, </em>259 Mont. at 236, 855 P.2d at 122, and moreover, that plaintiffs had a secondary easement to reasonably enter, inspect, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>repair, and maintain the ditch. <em>Kephart, </em>259 Mont. at 238, 855 P.2d at 124. Because plaintiffs had previously acknowledged defendants\u2019 ditch rights but had, nonetheless, forced defendants into court to defend those rights, we held that the filing of the lawsuit alone constituted an impairment of defendants\u2019 easement rights under \u00a7 70-17-112, MCA. <em>Kephart, </em>259 Mont. at 239, 855 P.2d at 124.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\">\u00b648 Although evidence in the record here supports the District Court\u2019s finding that Byrums did not <em>physically </em>interfere with Respondents\u2019 rights to the Ditch, we agree with Respondents that the District Court failed to apply the rule in Kephart-i.e. that the filing of this lawsuit alone could constitute an impairment of Respondents\u2019 easement rights under \u00a7 70-17-112, MCA. In their original complaint, Byrums alleged that Respondents trespassed onto their property. This claim was made notwithstanding the terms of the Settlement Agreement in which Byrums agreed they would not interfere with the Respondents\u2019 reasonable use of their water rights, ditch rights, and secondary easement rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">\u00b649 Respondents assert that Byrums\u2019 lawsuit and their allegation of trespass interfered with their water rights, ditch rights, and secondary easement rights. The record reflects that Byrums dismissed their trespass claim shortly before trial. Nonetheless, Respondents contend that in pursuing their claim up to the point of trial, Byrums interfered with their ditch and easement rights under \u00a7 70-17-112, MCA. We agree. As noted above, the statute provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-6\">(1) A person with a canal or ditch easement has a secondary easement to enter, inspect, repair, and maintain a canal or ditch.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-7\">(2) No person may encroach upon or otherwise impair any easement for a canal or ditch used for irrigation or any other lawful domestic or commercial purpose, including carrying return water.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">Section 70-17-112(1)\u2014(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-9\">\u00b650 As did the plaintiffs in <em>Kephart, </em>Byrums expressly acknowledged Respondents\u2019 water rights, ditch rights, and secondary easement rights in the Settlement Agreement. Yet, Byrums filed suit against Respondents alleging trespass based on Respondents\u2019 accessing the Ditch for maintenance purposes. As we held in <em>Kephart, </em>the filing of the trespass claim impaired and interfered with Respondents\u2019 rights under \u00a7 70-17-112, MCA. Respondents were forced into court to defend their clearly established rights under the Settlement Agreement. Thus, we hold that the District Court erred in dismissing Respondents\u2019 interference claim under \u00a7 70-17-112, MCA, and we remand for further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>proceedings to determine Respondents\u2019 damages, if any.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">\n<em>Respondents\u2019 Breach of Settlement Agreement Counterclaim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Ajh\">\u00b651 Respondents further argue in their respective counterclaims and cross-appeals that Byrums breached the terms of the Settlement Agreement. The District Court, however, made no findings of fact in respect to this issue and merely concluded in its decree that \u201c[Respondents\u2019] counterclaims are hereby dismissed with prejudice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AQp\">\u00b652 M. R. Civ. P. 52(a) provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-5\">In all actions tried upon the facts without a jury or with an advisory jury, the court shall find the facts specially and state separately its conclusions of law thereon, and judgment shall be entered pursuant to Rule 58.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">We have explained that \u201c[t]he litmus test is whether a district court\u2019s order sets forth reasoning, based upon its findings of fact and conclusions of law, in a manner sufficient to allow informed appellate review.\u201d <em>Snavely v.

The court moreover made no specific conclusions of law in respect to the same, but instead, summarily concluded that Respondents\u2019 counterclaim should be dismissed with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">\u00b654 Without more, we are unable to evaluate the parties\u2019 arguments on the breach of the Settlement Agreement issue. Although the District Court recognized that Respondents had counterclaimed for breach of the Settlement Agreement, \u201cit is not enough that the trial court simply regurgitate the contentions of the parties and then reach a conclusion.\u201d <em>Snavely, </em>\u00b6 18. Rather, the District Court \u201cmust also make factual findings and combine those with a logical, reasoned analysis and application of the law to the facts.\u201d <em>Snavely, </em>\u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>\u00b655 The District Court failed to set forth its findings of fact and its conclusions of law in compliance with M. R. Civ. P. 52(a) in respect to Respondents\u2019 counterclaim for breach of the Settlement Agreement. Thus we are unable to address this issue on appeal. Section 27-12-201, MCA; <em>Snavely, </em>\u00b6 19; <em>Ray, </em>\u00b6 19. The District Court\u2019s order dismissing Respondents\u2019 counterclaim for breach of the Settlement Agreement must be vacated. We remand this issue with instructions that the District Court reconsider Respondents\u2019 breach of the Settlement Agreement counterclaim and enter appropriate findings of fact and conclusions of law thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">\n<em>Andrens\u2019 Statutory and Nuisance Counterclaims</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AOA\">\u00b656 Andrens individually contend that Byrums violated \u00a7 85-1-111, MCA, by interfering with their access to the Jefferson River, a navigable river. This statute states, in pertinent part, that \u201c[t]he right of any person ... to take and use any water ... from any stream or streams for the purpose of irrigation or any beneficial or industrial pursuit shall not be abridged.\u201d Section 85-1-111, MCA. Andrens argue Byrums violated this statute by interfering with Andrens\u2019 efforts to build an emergency barb to bring water into the Ditch. The specific behavior Andrens point to is Byrums\u2019 use of video and audio taping while Andrens were attempting to install the emergency barb to control river flow. Moreover, Andrens argue that Byrums\u2019 video and audio taping actions in this respect constitute a nuisance. In further support of their nuisance claim, Andrens also point to Byrums\u2019 use of a private airplane used in such a way to \u201cbuzz\u201d the Andrens\u2019 home.</p>\n<p id=\"AOI\">\u00b657 Again, the District Court entered no findings of fact or conclusions of law in respect to Andrens\u2019 alleged violation of \u00a7 85-1-111, MCA, or their nuisance claim. The court simply and summarily concluded that \u201c[Respondents\u2019] counterclaim alleging ... harassment is unfounded.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A5O\">\u00b658 As we did with respect to the previous issue-and for the same reasons-we conclude the District Court\u2019s order dismissing Andrens\u2019 statutory and nuisance counterclaim must be vacated. We remand this issue with instructions that the District Court reconsider Andrens\u2019 counterclaims for violation of \u00a7 85-1-111, MCA, and for nuisance and enter appropriate findings of fact and conclusions of law thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">\n<em>Clarks\u2019 Emotional Distress Counterclaim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"ATU\">\u00b659 Clarks individually allege on cross-appeal that Byrums\u2019 actions in regards to the Ditch and this litigation have caused them serious and severe emotional distress. Clarks assert that substantial evidence exists on the record to support their claim. We note that Respondents did not request emotional distress damages in their collective prayer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>for relief in the original counterclaim against Byrums. Clarks, however, in their individual amended counterclaim, request special damages in their prayer for relief. Accordingly, we must determine whether emotional distress damages are \u201cspecial damages\u201d for the purposes of Clarks\u2019 cross-appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">\u00b660 \u201cSpecial damages are the natural but not necessary result of the wrong or breach; whereas general damages are damages the law would impute as the natural, necessary and logical consequence of the wrong or breach.\u201d <em>Purington v. Sound West, </em>173 Mont. 106, 111-12, 566 P.2d 795, 798 (1977). Clarks have failed to cite any authority that would persuade us that emotional distress damages are the natural, necessary and logical consequence of Byrums\u2019 alleged interference with Clarks\u2019 rights to the Ditch. Thus, by default, Clarks\u2019 claimed emotional distress damages are special damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">\u00b661 Under M. R. Civ. P. 9(g), Clarks were required to \u201cspecifically state\u201d special damages in their pleadings. This Rule provides that \u201c[w]hen items of special damage are claimed, they shall be specifically stated.\u201d Because they did not \u201cspecifically state\u201d their request for emotional distress damages, as required by M. R. Civ. P. 9(g), Clarks failed to plead such damages properly. That does not dispose of this issue, however.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">\u00b662 At trial Clarks raised the issue of emotional distress and Byrums cross-examined Robert Clark on this issue. Although Byrums objected to much of Mr. Clark\u2019s testimony as being outside the pretrial order (discussed above), the record reveals that that Byrums did not specifically object to Clark\u2019s testimony regarding emotional distress.</p>\n<p id=\"AuF\">\u00b663 M. R. Civ. P. 15(b) provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-7\">Amendments to conform to the evidence. When issues not raised by the pleadings are tried by express or implied consent of the parties, they shall be treated in all respects as if they had been raised in the pleadings. Such amendment of the pleadings as may be necessary to cause them to conform to the evidence and to raise these issues may be made upon motion of any party at any time, even after judgment; <em>but failure to so amend does not affect the result of the trial of these issues.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">(Emphasis added). Clarks raised the issue of emotional distress during trial and Byrums cross-examined Mr. Clark on the issue. Thus, Clarks\u2019 emotional distress claim was tried by the \u201cimplied consent of the parties\u201d and should thus \u201cbe treated in all respects as if [it] had been raised in the pleadings.\u201d M. R. Civ. P. 15(b). Although there is no indication in the record that Clarks made a motion to amend the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>pleadings to conform to the evidence regarding emotional distress damages elicited at trial, a failure to move to amend the pleadings \u201cdoes not affect the result of the trial of these issues.\u201d M. R. Civ. P. 15(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">\u00b664 Clarks\u2019 claim of emotional distress having been tried, the District Court was required to issue findings of fact and conclusions of law in respect to this claim. The court entered no findings of fact or conclusions of law on Clarks\u2019 claim; the court simply and summarily dismissed it. Accordingly, and for the same reasons previously discussed, we conclude that the District Court\u2019s order dismissing Clarks\u2019 emotional distress counterclaim must be vacated. We remand this issue with instructions that the District Court reconsider Clarks\u2019 counterclaim and enter appropriate findings of fact and conclusions of law thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">Issue 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">\u00b665 <em>Did the District Court err in failing to award attorney\u2019s fees and costs to Respondents under \u00a7 70-17-112(5), MCA?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">\u00b666 In their cross-appeals, Respondents argue they are the prevailing party and entitled to costs and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 70-17-112(5), MCA. Section 70-17-112, MCA, again, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-8\">(1) A person with a canal or ditch easement has a secondary easement to enter, inspect, repair, and maintain a canal or ditch.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-9\">(2) No person may encroach upon or otherwise impair any easement for a canal or ditch used for irrigation or any other lawful domestic or commercial purpose, including carrying return water.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-10\">(5) If a legal action is brought to enforce the provisions of this section, the prevailing party is entitled to costs and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-11\">\u00b667 We have held that \u201cin order to be deemed a \u2018prevailing part/ for purposes of</p>\n<p id=\"b211-12\">\u00a7 70-17-112(5), MCA ... a party must successfully prevail on <em>all </em>claims raised pursuant to this statute.\u201d Espy <em>v.

Moreover, where a party brought an action under \u00a7 70-17-112, MCA, \u201cand then failed to prevail on <em>any </em>of his claims, the other party was entitled to costs and fees.\u201d <em>Engel v.

As we held in \u00b6 50, the District Court erred in determining that Byrums had not interfered with Respondents\u2019 rights under \u00a7 70-17-112, MCA. Accordingly, as a matter of law, Respondents are the prevailing party for the purposes of this issue. Thus, the District Court\u2019s failure to award Respondents their costs and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to \u00a7 70-17-112(5), MCA, is reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">\u00b669 Before leaving this discussion, however, we must address one other matter. Pursuant to Issue 2, we remanded this cause to the District Court for further proceedings as are determined to be necessary by the court and for entry of specific factual findings in support of its determination on whether Byrums violated Rule 11, and if so, as to the appropriateness of the choice of sanction imposed. <em>See </em>\u00b6\u00b6 29-37. Under the instant Issue, we are remanding for further proceedings for the determination of costs and attorney\u2019s fees for Byrums\u2019 violation of \u00a7 70-17-112, MCA. This raises the question of whether Byrums may be chargeable with both Rule 11 sanctions and statutory costs and attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">\u00b670 Because we did not locate any cases directly on point, we look to the Advisory Committee Notes to F. R. Civ. P. 11, from which Montana\u2019s Rule 11 derives. The Committee notes state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-6\">Rule 11 is not the exclusive source for control of improper presentations of claims, defenses, or contentions. <em>It does not supplant statutes permitting awards of attorney's fees to prevailing parties or alter the principles governing such awards. </em>It does not inhibit the court in punishing for contempt, in exercising its inherent powers, or in imposing sanctions, awarding expenses, or directing remedial action authorized under other rules or under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-8\">\u00b671 As already noted, an attorney or party is sanctioned under Rule 11 for signing and interposing pleadings, motions, and other papers for the improper purposes set out in the Rule. <em>See </em>\u00b6\u00b6 16, 19, 32. On the other hand, a person is punished pursuant to \u00a7 70-17-112, MCA, for forcing the plaintiff to vindicate in court his or her rights under the statute. In short, the conduct being punished is distinct under each respective source of authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-9\">\u00b672  Therefore, we conclude that the District Court may award sanctions for both a Rule 11 violation and statutory attorney\u2019s fees and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>costs. That said, however, we also conclude that if the District Court chooses to impose attorney\u2019s fees and costs as a sanction for the Rule 11 violation, it must insure that the attorney's fees and costs imposed for that violation are not based on the conduct for which attorney\u2019s fees and costs are awarded under the statute. Parties are entitled to be awarded their attorney\u2019s fees and costs once for conduct sanctioned under the statute and under the Rule (if awarding fees and costs is the sanction imposed). Litigants are not, however, entitled to duplicate awards for the same conduct. We expect that the District Court will sort through these matters and issue specific findings of fact following an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">\u00b673 In summary, we affirm the District Court\u2019s decision that Respondents did not breach the Settlement Agreement. Byrums\u2019 unsuccessful appeal of that issue is therefore affirmed. However, we order the District Court\u2019s grant of Rule 11 sanctions against Byrums vacated and we remand this issue to the District Court for farther proceedings in accordance with our discussion and decision under Issue 2. Additionally, we hold that while the District Court may have abused its discretion in admitting Clark\u2019s testimony of other incidents with Byrums, the court\u2019s error caused no demonstrated prejudice and was therefore harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">\u00b674 With respect to Respondents\u2019 cross-appeals, the District Court\u2019s erred in finding that Byrums did not interfere with Respondents\u2019 rights to the Ditch pursuant to \u00a7 70-17-112, MCA. We reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with our discussion under Issue 4, \u00b6\u00b6 45-50. We also reverse and remand to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with our discussion in Issue 4: Respondents\u2019 claim that Byrums breached the Settlement Agreement; Andrens\u2019 claim that Byrums violated \u00a7 85-1-111, MCA, and caused a nuisance; and Clarks\u2019 claim of emotional distress resulting from Byrums\u2019 conduct and their instigation of the instant lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">\u00b675 Finally, the issue of Respondents\u2019 attorney\u2019s fees and costs is reversed and remanded to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with our discussion in Issue 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-8\">\u00b676 Affirmed in part; reversed in part; and remanded in part for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b213-9\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES COTTER, LEAPHART and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b198-6\"> <em>See also Ponderosa Pines Ranch, Inc. v.
