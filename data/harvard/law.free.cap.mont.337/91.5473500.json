Kreitzberg Rentals, LLC, (Kreitzberg) filed a contingent cross-appeal to be addressed in the event that we reverse. We affirm the District Court\u2019s denial of Seeley\u2019s motion to alter judgment and for a new trial on damages. We decline to address Kreitzberg\u2019s contingent cross-appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"AI4\">\u00b62 Seeley presents the following issues for review:</p>\n<p id=\"b118-10\">\u00b63 1. Whether substantial credible evidence supports the jury\u2019s verdict that Kreitzberg\u2019s negligence did not cause Seeley\u2019s fall and injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-12\">\u00b64 2. Whether the District Court properly allowed evidence of a lack of prior accidents on Kreitzberg\u2019s property before Seeley\u2019s fall and evidence that Kreitzberg spent more than $80,000 in improvements on the property after Seeley fell.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-13\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b118-14\">\u00b65 Seeley broke her ankle on March 3, 2003, when she slipped and fell outside of her office on Broadwater Avenue in Billings, Montana. Seeley filed a complaint against Kreitzberg, the owner of the property, on December 17, 2003. The complaint alleged that the building\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>defective rain-gutter design and Kreitzberg\u2019s negligence in failing to remove ice and snow from the walkway caused her injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\">\u00b66 Kreitzberg denied the allegations of negligence. Kreitzberg also alleged that any damages suffered by Seeley resulted from her own negligence. Kreitzberg then filed a third-party complaint against John Gilbertson (Gilbertson), whom Kreitzberg hired to remove snow and ice from its Broadwater Avenue property. The third-party complaint also named various other contractors who designed, built, or maintained Kreitzberg\u2019s building. The court dismissed all third-party defendants before trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">\u00b67 Seeley filed a pre-trial motion with the court to exclude certain evidence. Seeley first sought to exclude evidence that no other person had slipped and fallen on Kreitzberg\u2019s property and that Kreitzberg had received no complaints about the condition of its parking lots or walkways before Seeley\u2019s fall. Seeley also sought to exclude evidence of repairs that Kreitzberg had made to the building after Seeley\u2019s fall. The court denied Seeley\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">\u00b68 A jury trial began on October 24, 2005. Seeley testified that the weather was \u201csnowing and cold\u201d when she walked out of her office at noon on March 3, 2003, to warm up her car. Seeley stated that she stepped on a patch of ice near a downspout to the building\u2019s gutter system while on her way to her car and that her feet \u201cflew out from underneath\u201d her. Seeley fell to the ground and could not get up.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">\u00b69 Robin Hanel (Hanel), Seeley\u2019s co-worker, testified that she and a client ran outside to help Seeley. Hanel further testified that, once she helped Seeley into the office, she bought a camera so that she could \u201cdocument\u201d that Seeley fell on ice. The court admitted the pictures into evidence. The pictures show that winter weather conditions existed on the day of Seeley\u2019s fall. Snow covered most of the parking lot and a portion of the walkway outside of Kreitzberg\u2019s commercial building. The pictures also illustrate the proximity of the gutter\u2019s downspout to the snow-covered walkway where Seeley fell.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-8\">\u00b610 Darrell Kreitzberg, the principal officer of Kreitzberg Rentals, LLC, testified that he first noticed drainage problems at the building in 1998 or 1999. Kreitzberg stated that cars repeatedly had damaged the downspouts to the roofs gutter system. He hired contractors to redesign three of the five downspouts on the building to run under the walkway to solve the drainage problems. Kreitzberg admitted that the downspout nearest to Seeley\u2019s fall had not been re-routed under the sidewalk because it was located in an area with minimal foot traffic. Kreitzberg also admitted that water from the downspout drained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>directly onto the walkway and into a groove in the cement before draining to a grassy area. He testified that he had approved of this design, because he wanted the water to drain away from the parking lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">\u00b611 Kenneth Mielke (Mielke), a former meteorologist for the National Weather Service and an expert witness retained by Kreitzberg, testified that a cold front hit Billings on March 3, 2003. Mielke\u2019s testimony revealed that the bulk of the inclement weather associated with the cold front passed through Billings between 8 a.m. and 11 a.m., just about an hour before Seeley\u2019s fall. Mielke further testified that the National Weather Service reported wind gusts topping 23 miles per hour and light, steady snow falling throughout the day. Mielke stated that the recorded temperature at the time of Seeley\u2019s fall was about 16 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">\u00b612 The jury returned a verdict in favor of Kreitzberg on October 26, 2005. The jury found Kreitzberg negligent, but determined that Kreitzberg\u2019s negligence had not caused Seeley\u2019s fall and injuries. The court entered judgment in favor of Kreitzberg and ordered Seeley to pay Kreitzberg\u2019s costs in the matter. Seeley filed a motion with the District Court to alter the judgment and for a new trial on damages. The court, although \u201cbaffled\u201d by the jury\u2019s verdict, denied Seeley\u2019s motion. The court concluded that the jury could have found that natural weather conditions caused Seeley\u2019s fall rather than any conditions created by Kreitzberg\u2019s negligent conduct. Seeley appeals the jury\u2019s verdict and the District Court\u2019s denial of her motion to alter the judgment and for a new trial on damages. Seeley also appeals the court\u2019s denial of her pre-trial motion to exclude evidence from trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">\u00b613 We exercise an extremely limited review of jury verdicts. <em>Morgan v. Great Falls School Dist. No. 1, </em>2000 MT 28, \u00b6 8, 298 Mont. 194, \u00b6 8, 995 P.2d 422, \u00b6 8. We refuse to overturn a jury verdict supported by substantial credible evidence. Substantial credible evidence means evidence that \u201ca reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d Even weak and conflicting evidence may be deemed substantial to support a jury\u2019s verdict. <em>Morgan, \u00b6 </em>8. The determination of credibility and weight of the evidence lies within the province of the jury. <em>Moore v. Beye, </em>2005 MT 266, \u00b6 8, 329 Mont. 109, \u00b6 8, 122 P.3d 1212, \u00b6 8. We must view the evidence, therefore, in the light most favorable to the prevailing party. <em>Moore, </em>\u00b6 8. We will not reverse the district court\u2019s decision to grant or deny a motion for a new trial absent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>a manifest abuse of discretion. <em>Moore, </em>\u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\">\u00b614 The district court maintains broad discretion in determining the admissibility of evidence. <em>In re </em>T.W., 2006 MT 153, \u00b6 8, 332 Mont. 454, \u00b6 8, 139 P.3d 810, \u00b6 8. We refuse to overturn the district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings absent an abuse of the court\u2019s discretion. <em>Kissock v. Butte Convalescent Center, </em>1999 MT 332, \u00b6 10, 297 Mont. 307, \u00b6 10, 992 P.2d 1271, \u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">\u00b615 <em>Whether substantial credible evidence supports the jury\u2019s verdict that Kreitzberg\u2019s negligence did not cause Seeley\u2019s fall and injuries.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AQ1\">\u00b616 Seeley argues that Kreitzberg admitted that the downspout caused Seeley\u2019s fall and injuries, and thus the jury should have been prevented from reaching any other conclusion. Counsel for Kreitzberg stated in his opening statement: \u2018We admit, Darrell and I, we have never really contested that the downspout may have been, and probably was, a contributing factor to her fall. She certainly fell there, near the base of the downspout.\u201d Seeley contends that counsel\u2019s statement constituted a judicial admission from which Kreitzberg cannot retreat. Seeley also maintains that, aside from the judicial admission, no evidence exists to support the jury\u2019s verdict that something other than Kreitzberg\u2019s negligence caused her fall and injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">\u00b617 We first note that counsel\u2019s statement does not constitute a judicial admission. A judicial admission represents \u201can express waiver made in court by a party or his attorney\u201d that concedes the truth of an alleged fact for the purposes of trial. <em>Kohne v. Yost, </em>250 Mont. 109, 112, 818 P.2d 360, 362 (1991). A party remains bound by a judicial admission only if the admission constitutes an unequivocal statement of fact. <em>Kohne, </em>250 Mont. at 112, 818 P.2d at 362. Counsel\u2019s statement, although prefaced with the language of an admission, merely acknowledged that the downspout <em>\u201cmay have been, and probably was\u201d </em>one of the many possible contributing factors in Seeley\u2019s fall. (Emphasis added). Counsel then presented other factors for the jury to consider in deciding what caused Seeley\u2019s fall, including Seeley\u2019s inattentiveness and the natural weather conditions. The statement, when considered in context with counsel\u2019s complete opening remarks, never unequivocally conceded that the downspout hazard constituted a substantial factor that caused Seeley\u2019s fall. The statement alone cannot constitute a binding judicial admission as to what caused Seeley\u2019s fall and injuries. The element of causation properly fell within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>the province of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">\u00b618 Seeley next argues that no evidence supports the jury\u2019s verdict that Kreitzberg\u2019s negligence did not cause her fall and injuries. The record shows, however, that the parties presented conflicting evidence on causation. Seeley testified that she walked out the front door of her office and along the covered walkway toward her car. Seeley stated that she slipped on ice near the downspout that had not been rerouted under the walkway. Seeley also presented photographs taken by Hanel on the day of her fall. The photographs depict a snowy walkway and some ice formation at the bottom of the downspout.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">\u00b619 Seeley then admitted on cross examination that she had not paid attention to the conditions when she walked out to her car. Seeley further testified that she had not been wearing a coat when she ventured into the 16-degree weather to start her car. Kreitzberg argued that Seeley\u2019s failure to wear a coat caused her to hurry to escape the cold weather. Seeley denied such a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">\u00b620 Kreitzberg also presented evidence that natural weather conditions, rather than the downspout, caused Seeley\u2019s fall. Mielke, a former meteorologist, testified that the inclement weather struck Billings the morning of Seeley\u2019s fall and continued throughout the day. Mielke also testified that gusty winds likely would have caused blowing snow to accumulate on the covered walkway outside of Seeley\u2019s office on Kreitzberg\u2019s property. Hanel\u2019s photographs showing a snow-covered walkway despite the fact that a roof sheltered the walkway from the weather supported Mielke\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">\u00b621  The determination of the weight and credibility of the evidence lies within the province of the jury. <em>Campbell v. Canty, </em>1998 MT 278, \u00b6 19, 291 Mont. 398, \u00b6 19, 969 P.2d 268, \u00b6 19. We defer to the jury\u2019s decisional role, keeping in mind its function to make \u201c \u2018difficult and uniquely human judgments that defy codification and that build discretion, equity, and flexibility into a legal system.\u2019 \u201d <em>Seltzer v. Morton, </em>2007 MT 62, \u00b6\u00b6 94-96 n. 8, 336 Mont. 225, \u00b6\u00b6 94-96 n. 8, 154 P.3d 561, \u00b6\u00b6 94-96 n. 8 <em>(quoting McCleskey v. Kemp, </em>481 U.S. 279, 311, 107 S. Ct. 1756, 1777 (1987)). Although a jury verdict may be difficult to explain, the lack of predictability in the jury\u2019s judgment does not warrant reversal of the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>Seltzer, </em>\u00b6 96 n. 8. It is not the function of this Court to agree or disagree with the jury\u2019s decision and, if conflicting evidence exists, we refuse to retry a case simply because the jury chose to believe one party over another. <em>Hoffman v. Austin, </em>2006 MT 289, \u00b6 22, 334 Mont. 357, \u00b6 22, 147 P.3d 177, \u00b6 22. We exercise very limited review of the jury\u2019s verdict, considering only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>whether substantial, credible evidence exists in the record to support the jury\u2019s findings. <em>Seltzer, </em>\u00b6 94.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\">\u00b622  The jury weighed the conflicting evidence that Kreitzberg\u2019s defective design of the downspout caused Seeley\u2019s fall against other evidence that Seeley\u2019s haste and carelessness caused her to fall on ice and snow that had accumulated in the recent storm that struck Billings shortly before the accident. The jury apparently attributed Seeley\u2019s haste and carelessness as the cause of her fall. The evidence supporting such a finding in this case may be weak and conflicting, but substantial enough to support the jury\u2019s verdict when viewed in the light most favorable to Kreitzberg. <em>Campbell, </em>\u00b6 18. We refuse to disturb the jury\u2019s verdict unless its findings Eire \u201cinherently impossible to believe.\u201d <em>Campbell, </em>\u00b6 19. We conclude that the jury\u2019s findings are not inherently impossible to believe given the competing evidence presented on the issue of causation. The District Court properly denied Seeley\u2019s motion to alter the judgment and for a new trial on damages. \u00b623 <em>Whether the District Court properly allowed evidence of a lack of prior accidents on Kreitzberg\u2019s property before Seeley\u2019s fall and evidence that Kreitzberg spent more than $80,000 in improvements on the property after Seeley fell.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">\u00b624 Seeley argues first that the District Court abused its discretion in allowing Kreitzberg to testify that he received no previous complaints about the hazardous condition before Seeley\u2019s fall on March 3, 2003. Seeley admits that evidence of previous injuries occurring in the same location may be relevant under M. R. Evid. 401 to show whether the defendant had notice of the dangerous condition if such accidents happened under similar circumstances. <em>See Kissock, </em>\u00b6 15. Seeley contends, however, that evidence of the lack of previous falls or complaints is irrelevant because it fails to disprove negligent conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"A1Q\">\u00b625 Seeley also argues that the District Court improperly admitted evidence of Kreitzberg\u2019s subsequent remedial measures. Kreitzberg testified at trial that he hired a contractor to install heat tape and an automatic boiler system in the parking lot at the Broadwater Avenue property after Seeley\u2019s fall. Kreitzberg further testified that the improvements cost more than $80,000 to install and about $1,900 per month to operate in the winter months. Seeley contends that Kreitzberg\u2019s testimony should have been excluded as irrelevant under M. R. Evid. 403. Seeley also argues that the repairs constituted a subsequent remedial measure and should have been excluded under M. R. Evid. 407. Seeley maintains that the evidence prejudiced her in that it allowed Kreitzberg to offer self-serving statements that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>improperly influenced the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">\u00b626  The district court maintains broad discretion in determining whether evidence is relevant and admissible. <em>Kissock, </em>\u00b6 10. We review a court\u2019s evidentiary rulings to determine whether the court abused its discretion by acting arbitrarily without conscientious judgment or in excess of the bounds of reason. <em>Seltzer, </em>\u00b6 65. An abuse of discretion does not constitute reversible error absent prejudice. <em>Christofferson v. City of Great Falls, </em>2003 MT 189, \u00b6 28, 316 Mont. 469, \u00b6 28, 74 P.3d 1021, \u00b6 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">\u00b627 We need not reach the issue of whether the court abused its discretion in allowing Kreitzberg\u2019s testimony on the lack of prior accidents and subsequent remedial measures taken after Seeley\u2019s fall as the evidence caused no prejudice to Seeley. Seeley challenges both evidentiary issues on grounds that the testimony improperly influenced the jury\u2019s determination of Kreitzberg\u2019s negligence. The jury concluded that Kreitzberg was negligent, however, despite hearing Kreitzberg\u2019s allegedly bolstering testimony. Seeley could not have been prejudiced as the jury returned a verdict on the issue of Kreitzberg\u2019s negligence in her favor. Any abuse of discretion committed by the court could not constitute reversible error absent prejudice. <em>Christofferson, </em>\u00b6 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">\u00b628 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b124-7\">JUSTICES NELSON, WARNER, LEAPHART and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
