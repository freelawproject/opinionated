We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-8\">\u00b62 We consider the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b174-9\">\u00b63 (1) Did particularized suspicion exist to support a canine sniff of April\u2019s vehicle?</p>\n<p id=\"b174-10\">\u00b64 (2) Did the District Court err by denying April\u2019s motion to suppress statements she made to law enforcement on the grounds that she had not been given <em>Miranda </em>warnings and, further, had requested an attorney?</p>\n<p id=\"b174-11\">\u00b65 (3) Was the search warrant issued for April\u2019s vehicle supported by probable cause?</p>\n<p id=\"b174-12\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b174-13\">\u00b66 On April 7,2004, April called her aunt and uncle, Anna and Vonn Friddle, to advise that she was coming to visit them in Boulder. Vonn and Anna had prior knowledge of April\u2019s involvement with drugs and were concerned that she was going to be on drugs or bring drugs with her to their home. Vonn knew from April\u2019s mother that April had outstanding warrants for her arrest in Montana. According to her mother, April was also facing felony charges in Washington. Vonn called April\u2019s mother to get more information and spoke with April\u2019s stepfather. In the course of the conversation, the stepfather commented that he wished law enforcement would \u201cjust lock [April] up to get her the help she needs.\u201d Vonn offered to let law enforcement know that April was at his house so an officer could arrest her on her outstanding warrants. After April\u2019s stepfather endorsed this suggestion, Vonn called his brother, Ronnie Hayes (Hayes), who is a dispatcher at the Boulder Police Department. In response to the call, Hayes confirmed that April had outstanding arrest warrants and arranged for an officer to arrest her.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-14\">\u00b67 Shortly thereafter, April arrived at the Friddles\u2019 house. Officer Kosola (Kosola), of the Boulder Police Department, was dispatched to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>the Friddles\u2019 home to arrest April on the outstanding warrants. When Kosola arrived he saw a vehicle with Washington license plates parked behind Vonn\u2019s car. Kosola knocked on the door of the residence, and Anna let him inside. He informed April of the outstanding warrants and placed her under arrest. Kosola handcuffed April, checked for weapons, and informed her of her <em>Miranda </em>rights.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Alg\">\u00b68 After Kosola arrested April, she expressed her concern to him that she would not be able to make a timely appearance in Spokane, Washington, to face drug charges. Kosola confirmed April\u2019s statements by contacting the local authorities in Spokane and verifying through the Criminal Justice Information Network (CJIN) that she had felony drug charges pending in Washington.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\">\u00b69 Shortly after Kosola arrested April, Deputy Smoke (Smoke) of the Jefferson County Sheriffs Office arrived at the Friddles\u2019 residence. While Kosola was transporting April to the police station, Smoke stayed and spoke with the Friddles. Both Vonn and Anna told Smoke that April had a drug problem, and they were very concerned about her. The Friddles also informed Smoke that they wanted April\u2019s car, which was parked behind their car, removed from their property. Smoke radioed Kosola to inform him of this and also reported that he had observed that the vehicle\u2019s ignition was \u201cpunched\u201d-a common indicator that the vehicle was stolen. Kosola ran a registration check and asked April about the vehicle. April explained that she bought the car from a woman in Washington State, and had a bill of sale in the glove box. April agreed to a limited search of the glove box and a door panel of the car to collect the ownership documentation, which Kosola conveyed to Smoke.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">\u00b610 Kosola also advised April that the Friddles wanted her car removed, and April responded by advising Kosola that she wanted her car towed to her mother\u2019s house in Lewis and Clark County. Kosola found April\u2019s response \u201cdemanding\u201d and given with an urgent sense of wanting the car towed immediately. He advised April that Montana <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>City Towing could tow it to that establishment\u2019s property much cheaper than towing it to the Lewis and Clark County location, and further suggested that the fee for towing the car that far could well exceed the value of the vehicle, which Kosola estimated to be $150. However, April insisted on doing so, which Kosola found to be unusual and suspicious. A tow truck was dispatched but, upon arriving at the scene, the tow truck operator was advised to wait, because by then additional events had occurred and police had decided to initiate a canine sniff, as discussed below. Ultimately, April\u2019s mother declined to pay the cost of having the car towed to her residence, and the vehicle was impounded.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">\u00b611 Smoke searched the glove box and obtained the bill of sale and title documents. On a first look, it appeared to Smoke that the seller\u2019s signatures on the bill of sale and on the registration did not match, raising a concern that different people had signed the seller\u2019s name.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> While completing that limited search, Smoke noticed a white pill in plain view on the dashboard, which he could not identify, but which had numbers imprinted thereon. Smoke advised Kosola about the pill and relayed the imprinted numbers. Kosola asked April about the pill and, according to Kosola, April answered evasively, which Kosola thought suspicious. He testified regarding the pill as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-5\">Q. So this pill at the time, until it\u2019s verified what it is, it would be suspicious to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-6\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-7\">Q. And why would that be?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-8\">A. It could be Oxycontin; it could have been anything. I don\u2019t know what kind of pill it was. Unknown pill.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-9\">Q. And somebody who has had a drug history, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-10\">A. Yes. They\u2019re looking for an easy fix.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b176-11\">\u00b612 Smoke testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-12\">Q. At that time, you had background information that ... the potential owner had some drug history; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-13\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-14\">Q. So when seeing the pill, did that raise any suspicion for you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AWs\">A. That did. I looked through the windshield at the pill, and was able to obtain the numbers off of the side facing up ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-15\">Q. When seeing a pill and seeing numbers on it, would that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>alleviate any suspicion that it could be illegal narcotics?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-4\">A. No, it would not, because it could be a prescription drug belonging to somebody else, because obviously it wasn\u2019t in the prescription container; or it could be a controlled narcotics or something like that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">\u00b613 Based on what had transpired, Kosola requested that Deputy Grimsrud (Grimsrud) of the Jefferson County Sheriffs Office bring his narcotics detection dog to conduct a canine sniff of April\u2019s vehicle. The dog \u201chit\u201d or alerted to the odor of drugs on the vehicle. Kosola informed April that the narcotics dog had alerted to her vehicle and again gave her a <em>Miranda </em>warning from a printed advisory card. April then indicated that there was drug paraphernalia in the vehicle, and Kosola asked her for permission to search the vehicle. Kosola testified that April was then \u201cfidgety,\u201d but gave a second limited consent to search the vehicle, specifying that police search only the vehicle\u2019s console, within which a marijuana pipe would be found in a silver box. This was found in the later search. Kosola testified that he drew suspicions from the limiting conditions April had placed on both the first and second consents to search.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">\u00b614 Kosola then contacted his superior, the chief of police, and the county attorney, and followed their direction to apply for a search warrant and impound the vehicle. The warrant application referenced some, but not all, of the above-described events. Upon receiving the warrant, Kosola executed the search, finding marijuana pipes and drug paraphernalia in the trunk with marijuana and methamphetamine residue on them.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">\u00b615 April filed a motion to suppress the evidence, which was denied. April appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-8\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b177-9\">\u00b616 This Court reviews a district court\u2019s grant or denial of a motion to suppress to determine whether the district court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous and whether those findings were correctly applied as a matter of law. <em>State v. Ochadleus, </em>2005 MT 88, \u00b6 16, 326 Mont. 441, \u00b6 16, 110 P.3d 448, \u00b6 16 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-10\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b177-11\">\u00b617 1. Did particularized suspicion exist to support a canine sniff of April\u2019s vehicle?</p>\n<p id=\"b177-12\">\u00b618 April argues that the District Court\u2019s denial of her motion to suppress evidence should be reversed because there was insufficient objective data to constitute the necessary particularized suspicion for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>police to initiate a canine sniff with the narcotics detection dog. The law allows \u201cfor a carefully drawn exception to the warrant requirement, but still require[s] particularized suspicion when the area or object subject to the canine sniff is already exposed to the public.\u201d <em>State v. Tackitt, </em>2003 MT 81, \u00b6 29, 315 Mont. 59, \u00b6 29, 67 P.3d 295, \u00b6 29. To establish particularized suspicion, the State must show: (1) objective data from which an experienced police officer can make certain inferences; and (2) a resulting suspicion that the person is or has been engaged in wrongdoing or was a witness to criminal activity. <em>State v. Gopher, </em>193 Mont. 189, 194, 631 P.2d 293, 296 (1981). Whether the State has particularized suspicion is a question of fact that is analyzed under the totality of the circumstances. <em>State v. Pratt, </em>286 Mont. 156, 161, 951 P.2d 37, 40 (1997). In evaluating the totality of the circumstances, a court should consider the quantity, or content, and quality, or degree of reliability, of the information available to the officer. <em>Pratt, </em>286 Mont. at 161, 951 P.2d at 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">\u00b619 April challenges the particularized suspicion determination, first, by noting that the initial concerns regarding her car\u2019s ownership were alleviated. She argues that her family\u2019s concerns about her drug use were unfounded and uncorroborated, and that there was no evidence that the white pill was contraband. Lastly, April argues that the suspicions taken by Kosola from the limited consent to search she gave are unfounded because such limitation \u201cis not objective evidence\u201d and she retained her constitutional right of privacy in the remaining portions of her vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">\u00b620 On this last point, the District Court agreed with April, concluding that a limitation on permission to search cannot be considered for purposes of determining particularized suspicion. Thus, it disregarded the limitation placed upon the search by April in analyzing particularized suspicion, and we do likewise.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">\u00b621 The State responds that after Kosola\u2019s contact with April was lawfully initiated pursuant to her arrest on outstanding warrants, officers properly relied on April\u2019s family\u2019s concerns about her drug use because Kosola knew the family was concerned enough to disclose April\u2019s location, in their own home, so that law enforcement could arrest her there. Then, April herself advised Kosola of her pending drug charges in Washington and expressed her concerns about being able to timely appear to answer those charges. The District Court relied upon these factors and also noted Kosola\u2019s efforts to confirm the charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">\u00b622 As for the white pill, the State contends that it was proper, in light of April\u2019s own admission to pending drug charges, to consider it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>as possible contraband even though it was not immediately identifiable as such. In its discussion about the white pill, the District Court noted that the pill was <em>\u201ca </em>concern,\u201d but not very significant. The District Court did find that April\u2019s \u201cevasive attitude\u201d in response to questioning by Kosola was a significant factor supporting particularized suspicion.</p>\n<p id=\"Ahm\">\u00b623 The District Court identified April\u2019s \u201curgency\u201d in seeking to arrange the towing of her vehicle to Lewis and Clark County, and her willingness to pay more than the car was worth for towing, as a consideration in its probable cause analysis, also made from the bench, but did not do so in its discussion of particularized suspicion. This may result from the mention of this urgency in Kosola\u2019s application for issuance of a search warrant. However, the testimony illustrates that Kosola\u2019s suspicions in this regard were also raised prior to his decision to seek the canine sniff. A tow truck had been called out to tow the vehicle, but the towing was delayed when Kosola, having thereafter been notified of Smoke\u2019s discovery of the white pill and hearing April\u2019s evasive answers with regard to the pill, determined to initiate a canine sniff of the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">\u00b624  On these facts-the family report about April\u2019s drug use and notification of April\u2019s location in their home, April\u2019s admission of pending drug charges in Washington, police confirmation of pending felony drug charges, April\u2019s urgency in seeking removal of her vehicle out of the county and her unusual desire to pay more than the car was worth to do so, the discovery of the white pill and April\u2019s evasiveness about the pill-we conclude that the District Court did not err in holding that the officers had particularized suspicion to conduct the canine sniff of April\u2019s vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">\u00b625 2. Did the District Court err by denying April\u2019s motion to suppress statements she made to law enforcement on the grounds that she had not been given <em>Miranda </em>warnings and, further, had requested an attorney?</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">\u00b626 April argues that she was not given her <em>Miranda </em>warnings as required by law, and thus the District Court\u2019s denial of the motion to suppress evidence should be reversed. April contends that she made a request for an attorney that was unambiguous and she never waived her <em>Miranda </em>rights. The State argues that the District Court\u2019s finding that Kosola read April the <em>Miranda </em>warnings is not clearly erroneous and that the court correctly resolved any factual disputes in the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">\u00b627 At the suppression hearing, April testified that she could not recall Kosola reading her <em>Miranda </em>rights. Kosola, however, testified he was certain that as soon as he placed April under arrest, he took a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>card from his pocket containing the <em>Miranda </em>warning, and read it to April. April\u2019s aunt, Anna Friddle, corroborated Kosola\u2019s testimony that the warning had been given at her house. The District Court resolved this conflicting evidence by finding that April had been advised of her <em>Miranda </em>rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">\u00b628 This Court recognizes that the credibility of witnesses and the weight to be given their testimony are determined by the trier of fact, and disputed questions of fact and credibility will not be disturbed on appeal. <em>State v. Bauer, </em>2002 MT 7, \u00b6 15, 308 Mont. 99, \u00b6 15, 39 P.3d 689, \u00b6 15. If evidence conflicts, it is within the province of the trier of fact to determine which will prevail. <em>Bauer, </em>\u00b6 15. Here, the District Court assessed the credibility of the witnesses and found that Kosola gave <em>Miranda </em>warnings to April. We conclude that this finding was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">\u00b629 April also testified that she asked for an attorney after being advised by Kosola that the drug dog had alerted to her car. This assertion was contested by Kosola, who testified that April did not request an attorney. Unfortunately, the District Court did not make a finding on this particular conflict in the testimony. In its verbal findings on these issues, the District Court stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-6\">The Court finds and concludes that the more credible evidence is that the Defendant was given her Miranda rights on more than one occasion over the course of the day. Thereafter she volunteered the admission and the existence of drug paraphernalia within the vehicle which was to be searched ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AjS1\">\u00b630  We can only conclude from the District Court\u2019s finding that April \u201cvolunteered\u201d the information about drug paraphernalia in her car, that she was not also asking for an attorney. April\u2019s statement about the paraphernalia was made after Kosola advised her about the drug dog hit-the same time which April claimed to have asked for an attorney. The District Court found that, at that time, April was volunteering information about the drug paraphernalia, which would be inconsistent with a request for legal assistance. We thus conclude that April\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>claims were properly denied by the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">\u00b631 We note, however, that this factual issue, along with other issues addressed in this opinion, demonstrates that a district court\u2019s rendering of findings of fact and conclusions of law from the bench can quite easily be inadequate. Without careful drafting, issues can be overlooked and a decision issued which is insufficient for appellate review, resulting in remand. We urge the district courts to resolve factual and legal issues regarding suppression by way of a written <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>order.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\">\u00b632 3. Was the search warrant issued for April\u2019s vehicle supported by probable cause?</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">\u00b633 April argues that the search warrant obtained by the officers was not supported by probable cause. The United States and Montana Constitutions protect individuals from unreasonable searches and seizures. Amend. IV, U.S. Const.; Art. II, Sec. 11, Mont. Const. For a search warrant to issue, the application must state facts sufficient to show probable cause. <em>State v. Olson, </em>2003 MT 61, \u00b6 24, 314 Mont. 402, \u00b6 24, 66 P.3d 297, \u00b6 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">\u00b634  Probable cause to search exists \u201cif the facts and circumstances within the officer\u2019s personal knowledge ... are sufficient to warrant a reasonable person to believe that the suspect has committed an offense.\u201d <em>State v. Saxton, </em>2003 MT 105, \u00b6 26, 315 Mont. 315, \u00b6 26, 68 P.3d 721, \u00b6 26. Probable cause is evaluated in light of an officer\u2019s knowledge and all relevant circumstances. <em>State v. Van Dort, </em>2003 MT 104, \u00b6 19, 315 Mont. 303, \u00b6 19, 68 P.3d 728, \u00b6 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">\u00b635 April raises arguments similar to those she offered above against the factors considered for determining the existence of particularized suspicion, and also contends that her statements to the police should be excised from the warrant application because she asked for an attorney, an issue likewise addressed above. Because we have already rejected April\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>claims, we do not excise any information from the warrant application.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">\u00b636  In addition to the factors considered for particularized suspicion, except for the white pill, which was not referenced within the warrant application, Kosola\u2019s application also described the alert of the drug dog on April\u2019s vehicle, her admission thereafter that drug paraphernalia was located within the vehicle, and the officers\u2019 experience and qualifications with regard to drug crime investigation. We have previously concluded that probable cause for a search existed under similar circumstances. <em>See State v. Hart, </em>2004 MT 51, \u00b6 27, 320 Mont. 154, \u00b6 27, 85 P.3d 1275, \u00b6 27. Likewise, we hold that the District Court correctly concluded that probable cause existed for the issuance of the search warrant herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-9\">\u00b637 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b181-10\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES NELSON, COTTER, WARNER and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b175-6\"> Testimony from Kosola and Anna indicated that Kosola gave April a <em>Miranda </em>warning at the Riddle residence, following her arrest. April contested this testimony. In its oral findings, the District Court did not address the conflict over this specific <em>Miranda </em>warning, instead finding generally that \u201cthe more credible evidence is that the Defendant was given her <em>Miranda </em>rights on more than one occasion over the course of the day.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b175-7\"> In addition to the Washington drug charges, the CJIN report indicated that April had seven outstanding Montana misdemeanor warrants, but testimony indicated that a number of these were later found to be expired or invalid.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b176-16\"> April\u2019s ownership of the vehicle was ultimately verified by police, and the District Court concluded it would not consider the vehicle issues in determining the existence of particularized suspicion or probable cause herein.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
