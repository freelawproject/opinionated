Fischer (Ruby) appeals from the order of the Third Judicial District Court, Deer Lodge County, granting Respondent Frederick J. Fischer\u2019s (Frederick) motion for appointment of temporary guardians for their son, Jeret Fischer (Jeret), and appointing Barry and Angie Woods and Frank Austin as Jeret\u2019s co-guardians. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-9\">\u00b62 We consider the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b149-10\">\u00b63 (1) Is the order granting Frederick\u2019s request for a temporary guardianship of Jeret an appealable order?</p>\n<p id=\"b149-11\">\u00b64 (2) Did the District Court err by appointing temporary guardians of Jeret over the objection of Ruby, Jeret\u2019s mother?</p>\n<p id=\"b149-12\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b149-13\">\u00b65 Frederick and Ruby Fischer were married on August 13, 1994, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>and had one child, Jeret, who was born on May 24,1993. In April 2004, the parties dissolved their marriage and entered a stipulated parenting plan which was approved by the District Court. Under the plan, Frederick was designated as primary custodian of Jeret, while Ruby was awarded visitation every other weekend.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">\u00b66 Frederick and Jeret moved to Billings, Montana, in April 2005, and have lived in the home of friends Barry and Angie Woods since then. Frederick is employed by the U.S. Army Reserve in Billings, and Jeret attends school in Billings. Ruby resides in Butte with her ailing father for whom she provides care.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">\u00b67 In December 2005, Frederick received orders to report for active duty to Iraq on January 8, 2006. On December 20, 2005, Frederick filed a motion for an emergency hearing regarding Jeret. He sought, on the recommendation of Jeret\u2019s counselor, Lynn Pillman (Pillman), to have Barry and Angie Woods and Frank Austin, Ruby\u2019s brother, who also lives in Butte, Montana, appointed as temporary legal guardians of Jeret.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Upon being served with the motion, Ruby filed a motion to dismiss. After briefing and oral argument, the District Court granted Frederick\u2019s motion for temporary guardianship of Jeret. Ruby appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">\u00b68 This Court reviews a district court\u2019s conclusions of law related to the appointment of a guardian to determine if they are correct. <em>In re Guardianship of D.T.N., </em>275 Mont. 480, 483, 914 P.2d 579, 580 (1996) (citation omitted). We review findings of fact to determine whether they are clearly erroneous. <em>D.T.N., </em>275 Mont. at 483, 914 P.2d at 580 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b150-9\">\u00b69 <em>(1) Is the order granting Frederick\u2019s request for a temporary guardianship of Jeret an appealable order?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b150-10\">\u00b610 As a preliminary matter, Frederick argues this appeal must be dismissed because the District Court\u2019s temporary guardianship order is not appealable under M. R. App. P. 1, which allows appeals from a final judgment or special order made after final judgment. He notes that this Court has held \u201cthat orders of temporary custody are not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>\u2018final judgments,\u2019 subject to direct appeal, but instead are interlocutory orders from which this Court will grant relief in extraordinary circumstances.\u201d <em>In re D.A., </em>2003 MT 109, \u00b6 19, 315 Mont. 340, \u00b6 19, 68 P.3d 735, \u00b6 19. Frederick reasons that the granting of his request for appointment of a guardian is temporary, because the order automatically terminates on Frederick\u2019s return from Iraq or on further order of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">\u00b611 Ruby responds that the order appealed from should be considered final and appealable because the District Court ruling appointed guardians of Jeret in derogation of her parental rights. Ruby also points to M. R. App. P. 1(b)(3), which allows an aggrieved party to appeal from an \u201corder granting or refusing to grant, revoking or refusing to revoke, letters testamentary, or of administration, or of guardianship ....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">\u00b612  We have previously specifically interpreted M. R. App. P. 1(b)(3) with regard to temporary guardianship proceedings. In <em>Matter of Klos, </em>284 Mont. 197, 201, 943 P.2d 1277, 1279 (1997), we noted that \u201c[t]he rule defines an appealable order as an \u2018order granting or refusing to grant, revoking or refusing to revoke... guardianship,\u201d\u2019 and concluded from this plain language that the Rule \u201cdoes not differentiate between a permanent guardianship and a temporary guardianship. Thus, a district court order granting either a permanent or a temporary guardianship is appealable.\u201d <em>Klos, </em>284 Mont. at 201, 943 P.2d at 1279.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">\u00b613 Therefore, Ruby\u2019s appeal is properly before the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">\u00b614 <em>(2) Did the District Court err by appointing temporary guardians of Jeret over the objection of Ruby, Jeret\u2019s mother?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">\u00b615 Frederick initiated this matter by motioning the District Court, within the parties\u2019 earlier dissolution proceeding, for an emergency hearing and appointment of temporary legal guardians for Jeret, because of Frederick\u2019s forthcoming deployment to Iraq. Ruby responded by filing a motion to dismiss under M. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), arguing that absent a termination of her parental rights, a natural parent cannot lose the custody of his or her child in favor of a guardian. Frederick, in reply, argued that the court could modify the parties\u2019 existing parenting plan by authority of \u00a7 40-4-219, MCA, on a showing of changed circumstances and that a modification was necessary to serve the best interest of the child. Relying on \u00a7 40-4-219, MCA, and also citing \u00a7\u00a7 40-4-228 and 41-3-427, MCA, the District Court concluded that a change of circumstances had occurred as a result of Frederick\u2019s deployment and that an amendment to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>parenting plan was necessary to serve Jeret\u2019s best interests, appointed temporary guardians, and ordered that the guardianship be terminated upon Frederick\u2019s return from duty in Iraq or upon further order of the court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">\u00b616 Ruby contends the District Court impermissibly relied on the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 41-3-327 and 40-4-228, MCA, and argues that Title 72, Chapter 5, MCA, governs Frederick\u2019s request for appointment of a temporary guardian for Jeret. Ruby notes that \u00a7 72-5-222(1), MCA, provides a procedure for appointment of a guardian for a minor child in derogation of a parent\u2019s rights, and allows such only if \u201call parental rights of custody have been terminated or if parental rights have been suspended or limited by circumstances or prior court order.\u201d She maintains that because her parental rights have never been terminated, suspended, or limited by circumstances or by prior court order, the appointment of a guardian for Jeret was invalid. Frederick responds that Ruby\u2019s parental rights were indeed limited by a prior court order, that being the parenting plan agreed upon by the parties and approved by the District Court, which limited Ruby\u2019s parenting time to every other weekend. Moreover, Frederick contends that regardless of the appointment of temporary guardians, Ruby\u2019s limited parental rights remain intact and she may enjoy those limited rights at her convenience.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">\u00b617  As authority for its order, the District Court first cited to \u00a7 40-4-219, MCA, which provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-6\">Amendment of parenting plan - mediation. (1) The court may in its discretion amend a prior parenting plan if it finds, upon the basis of facts that have arisen since the prior plan or that were unknown to the court at the time of entry of the prior plan, that a change has occurred in the circumstances of the child and that the amendment is necessary to serve the best interest of the child.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">Section 40-4-219, MCA. However, \u201cmodification of a parenting plan is based on the best interests of the children <em>with regard to the respective parents.\u201d In re Marriage of Burk, </em>2002 MT 173, \u00b6 19, 310 Mont. 498, \u00b6 19, 51 P.3d 1149, \u00b6 19 (citing \u00a7 40-4-219, MCA) (emphasis added). Section 40-4-219, MCA, merely provides a mechanism for the court to amend a parenting plan as between the parties to that agreement. It does not provide authority to decide custody matters between a child\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>parents and third parties, including appointment of a third party as a child\u2019s guardian.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">\u00b618 Secondly, the District Court indicated that it had also relied upon \u00a7 40-4-228, MCA, although not raised by the parties. It provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-5\">Parenting and visitation matters between natural parent and third party. (1) <em>In cases when a nonparent seeks a parental interest in a child under 40-4-211 </em>or visitation with a child, the provisions of this chapter apply unless a separate action is pending under Title 41, chapter 3.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-6\">(2) A court may award a parental interest to a person other than a natural parent when it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-7\">(a) the natural parent has engaged in conduct that is contrary to the child-parent relationship; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-8\">(b) the nonparent has established with the child a child-parent relationship, as defined in 40-4-211, and it is in the best interests of the child to continue that relationship.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-9\">(5) It is not necessary for the court to find a natural parent unfit before awarding a parental interest to a third party under this section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b153-10\">Section 40-4-228, MCA (emphasis added). This provision provides standards by which a court may award a parental interest in a child to a nonparent who has brought a parenting plan proceeding pursuant to \u00a7 40-4-211, MCA. In turn, \u00a7 40-4-211, MCA; as we have previously noted, \u201cdefines a court\u2019s jurisdictional authority for child custody or parenting proceedings under the [Uniform Marriage and Divorce Act],\u201d <em>In re Parenting of D.A.H., </em>2005 MT 68, \u00b6 9, 326 Mont. 296, \u00b6 9, 109 P.3d 247, \u00b6 9, and, specifically, allows a parenting plan proceeding to be commenced in district court \u201c \u201cby a person other than a parent if the person has established a child-parent relationship with the child, by filing a petition for parenting in the county in which the child resides or is found.\u2019 \u201d <em>D.A.H., </em>\u00b6 9 (quoting \u00a7 40-4-211(4)(b), MCA).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-11\">\u00b619  Here, although Frederick asserts that the temporary guardians have \u201ca similar relationship of parent and child\u201d with Jeret, no nonparent has filed a parenting plan proceeding with regard to Jeret, in his residential county, pursuant to \u00a7 40-4-211, MCA. Indeed, Frederick cedes, in his Respondent\u2019s brief, that \u201cargument that a third party has brought this case is misplaced.\u201d The relief sought by Frederick\u2019s petition was not for the establishment of a new parenting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>interest, but for the placement of Jeret with temporary guardians. Thus, the District Court\u2019s reliance on \u00a7 40-4-228, MCA, was incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"AvJ\">\u00b620 Lastly, the District Court turned to \u00a7 41-3-427, MCA, within the child abuse and neglect statutes, and concluded that there were:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-4\">sufficient allegations within the context of this case for this Court to find that Jeret may be in danger of being abused or neglected if he were to reside with Respondent. Placement of Jeret with Respondent would trigger an immediate investigation and placement of Jeret in emergency protective services, most likely with Barry and Angie Woods.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">\u00b621 However, the District Court failed to note that \u00a7 41-3-427, MCA, provides \u201cthe county attorney, the attorney general, or an attorney hired by the county\u201d with authority to file a petition when it appears a child is abused or neglected or is in danger of being abused or neglected. Such a proceeding was not initiated here. While child abuse or neglect would be relevant to a determination of a child\u2019s proper placement in a guardianship proceeding, and a proceeding <em>properly initiated </em>under \u00a7 41-3-427, MCA, is a basis for placement with a nonparent, <em>see </em>\u00a7\u00a7 40-4-228(1) and 41-3-427(1)(a), MCA, this section does not provide independent authority for appointment of a guardian in disregard to the guardianship statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">\u00b622  In summary, the District Court erroneously relied on \u00a7\u00a7 40-4-219, 40-4-228, and 41-3-427, MCA, in granting Frederick\u2019s motion for temporary guardianship. Ruby correctly contends that Frederick\u2019s request was governed by Title 72, Chapter 5, MCA, which the District Court did not address. That chapter provides a procedure for appointment of a guardian of a minor child, but only if \u201call parental rights of custody have been terminated or if parental rights have been suspended or limited by circumstances or prior court order.\u201d Section 72-5-222(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">\u00b623  Frederick contends that the parenting plan approved within the dissolution action which granted only every other weekend for Ruby\u2019s parenting time constitutes an order limiting Ruby\u2019s parental rights for purposes of \u00a7 72-5-222(1), MCA.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, the parenting plan approved by the court within the parties\u2019 dissolution proceeding simply determined or limited visitation that Ruby may exercise with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>Jeret-it did not affect the standing of Ruby\u2019s parental rights to Jeret. As an illustrative example, the parenting plan provides that \u201c[t]he parents agree that they shall jointly make major decisions regarding the child\u2019s education, health care, religious upbringing, and recreational activities.\u201d Ruby\u2019s parental rights to Jeret were not \u201climited\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 72-5-222(1), MCA, by the parenting plan. Under the statute, that requires a court order directed at a party\u2019s <em>right </em>to parent, as opposed to arrangements defining a parent\u2019s custody and visitation times with a child in a dissolution proceeding. We therefore conclude that Ruby\u2019s parental rights were not previously limited by court order, and that the District Court was without authority to appoint temporary guardians for Jeret pursuant to \u00a7 72-5-222(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">\u00b624 The right of a parent to custody of their child has been recognized by this Court as being a fundamental constitutional right. <em>Matter of Guardianship of </em>Aschenbrenner, 182 Mont. 540, 544, 597 P.2d 1156, 1160 (1979) (citing <em>Matter of Guardianship of Doney, </em>174 Mont. 282, 285-86, 570 P.2d 575, 577 (1977)). The legislature has carefully enunciated the procedures the State must follow and the findings that the court must make before custody of a child may legally be taken from his natural parent. \u201cDistrict Courts must identify and adhere to the proper procedure and standards to be used in the proceedings before them. Only then will the fundamental rights and relationship existing between parent and child be fully realized or, when necessary, properly <em>severed.\" Aschenbrenner, </em>182 Mont. at 553, 597 P.2d at 1164. In view of these principles, we look closely at actions which interfere with that right. <em>Aschenbrenner, </em>182 Mont. at 544-45, 597 P.2d at 1160. Our examination in this case leads us to conclude that the granting of Frederick\u2019s petition for temporary guardianship for Jeret was improper and must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">\u00b625 Whether the District Court\u2019s concerns about Ruby\u2019s ability to parent will ultimately be borne out must be the subject of a proper proceeding to determine the same. Her parental rights have not been abridged and therefore, a guardianship cannot be granted over her objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">\u00b626 We reverse the entry of the order appointing temporary guardians of Jeret and remand for the entry of an order vacating the guardianship.</p>\n<judges id=\"b155-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES WARNER, NELSON and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b150-11\"> After Ruby informed Pillman that she had recently been awarded Social Security Disability based on mental illness, namely, severe depression, Pillman opined that it was unreasonable to presume Ruby was capable of providing for Jeret.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b152-8\"> The District Court also ordered that Ruby\u2019s rights wider the existing parenting plan shall continue and remain unchanged.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b154-8\"> Frederick does not allege that Ruby\u2019s parental rights were terminated, suspended, or limited by circumstances, but only that Ruby\u2019s parental rights were limited by a \u201cprior court order.\u201d Therefore, we analyze only whether the parties\u2019 parenting agreement qualified as a prior court order limiting Ruby\u2019s parental rights.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
