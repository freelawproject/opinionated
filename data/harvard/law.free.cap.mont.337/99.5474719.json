Further, the petitioner, having challenged counsel\u2019s effectiveness, \u201chas opened the gate to those portions of his revelations to his attorney that affect his claims in his petition for post-conviction relief,\u201d and is not in a position to object on the grounds of privilege. We ordered that Gillham\u2019s counsel respond to the allegations and that if, in making said response, he necessarily revealed confidential information from Gillham, counsel would \u201cnot be subject to disciplinary proceedings before the Commission of Practice of the State Bar of Montana, nor subject to charges of malpractice.\u201d <em>Gillham, </em>704 P.2d at 1020.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">\u00b63 At the time of the <em>Gillham </em>decision, petitions for post-conviction relief were addressed to the Supreme Court. Accordingly, the <em>Gillham </em>decision required that, if a response from counsel were necessary, \u201cthe Attorney General shall first apply to <em>this Court </em>for an order preserving such responding attorney from charges of discipline or malpractice for revealing necessary confidential information from such convicted person.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">\u00b64  Since <em>Gillham, </em>the post-conviction procedure has changed. Petitions for post-conviction relief are now initially filed in the district court rather than this Court. Section 46-21-105(2), MCA. Accordingly, we hereby clarify that <em>Gillham </em>motions may be filed in the district court wherein the post-conviction proceeding is pending. An attorney ordered to respond pursuant to a <em>Gillham </em>order issued by a district court shall not be subject to disciplinary proceeding before the Commission on Practice nor be subject to charges of malpractice. This immunity extends to all information, testimony or documents necessarily provided in response to the allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">DATED this 18th day of April, 2007.</p>\n<judges id=\"b126-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES LEAPHART, COTTER, WARNER and NELSON concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
