Jay Billmayer, d/b/a Billmayer Engineering (Billmayer), appeals from an order of the Eleventh Judicial District Court, Flathead County, denying his request for injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-9\">\u00b62 We review whether the District Court manifestly abused its discretion in denying Billmayer\u2019s request for injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-10\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b269-11\">\u00b63 Billmayer contracted with Springcreek Development (Springcreek) in 1999 to perform a floodplain study on a parcel of land south of Highway 2 near Kalispell. Springcreek had asked Billmayer to perform the study in response to the City of Kalispell\u2019s decision to bring an enforcement action against Springcreek for attempting to develop land in a floodplain. Springcreek filed Billmayer\u2019s floodplain study documents as part of its permit request with the City of Kalispell (the City), Flathead County, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-12\">\u00b64 The owners of a parcel of land near Springcreek\u2019s land contracted with Schwarz Architecture &amp; Engineering Inc. (Schwarz) sometime after Springcreek had filed the floodplain study documents with the various government entities. Schwarz requested permission from the City to review and make photocopies of Billmayer\u2019s Springcreek floodplain study. The City permitted Schwarz to review Billmayer\u2019s study, but declined to provide photocopies to Schwarz absent permission from Billmayer in light of the fact that he had \u201clabeled [the documents] as having a proprietary interest.\u201d Billmayer refused to grant Schwarz permission to photocopy the documents. The City then informed Billmayer that it would provide photocopies of the floodplain study documents to Schwarz unless he took \u201cformal action to bar\u201d Schwarz\u2019s request for photocopies.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-13\">\u00b65 Billmayer filed an \u201cApplication for Injunction\u201d in the District Court on December 15,2005, seeking to enjoin the City from providing Schwarz with photocopies of the floodplain study documents. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>Billmayer recognizes in his application for injunction that citizens are entitled to inspect and copy documents filed with the City pursuant to \u00a7 2-6-102, MCA. He argues, however, that his documents fall into an exception for documents that are \u201cconstitutionally protected from disclosure ....\u201d He emphasizes that he seeks only to enjoin the City from giving a photocopy of the floodplain study documents to Schwarz, but does not seek to enjoin Schwarz\u2019s right to inspect the documents. \u00b66 The court temporarily restrained the City from providing any photocopies of the floodplain study documents until it could conduct a \u201cshow-cause\u201d hearing. The court granted Schwarz\u2019s motion to intervene. The court held the show cause hearing on January 24,2006. \u00b67 Billmayer testified at the hearing that he had \u201cno objection to the public viewing\u201d the floodplain study. He objected only to \u201cthe copying\u201d of his documents. Billmayer also submitted a map, marked \u201cExhibit 1,\u201d at the proceedings as a representation of the floodplain study documents that Springcreek had filed with the various government entities. He drew the court\u2019s attention to the following \u201cproprietary language\u201d at the bottom of the map: \u201cThis document is the property of Billmayer Engineering, Kalispell, Montana. Unauthorized use, reproduction or duplication is strictly prohibited.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">\u00b68 Schwarz responded that it was entitled to inspect and copy the documents pursuant to \u00a7 2-6-102, MCA, regardless of Billmayer\u2019s \u201cproprietary language.\u201d The City stated briefly that it sought guidance from the court \u201cin regard to how we handle\u201d Billmayer\u2019s documents. The court directed the parties at the conclusion of the hearing to submit briefs after which the court would \u201cdeem [the matter] submitted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">\u00b69 Billmayer submitted a \u201cnotice of copyright protection\u201d along with his brief. The \u201cnotice\u201d states in part \u201cthat the document admitted as Exhibit 1 at the January 24, 2006, hearing in this case and contained within this court file has official copyright protection pursuant to federal law and the U.S. Copyright Office.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">\u00b610 The court denied Billmayer\u2019s application for injunction on April 10,2006. The court noted that \u201c[t]his [District] Court certainly cannot speculate or find that [Schwarz\u2019s] contemplated use of the data contained in the documents would constitute a taking requiring compensation, possibly violate copyright law or in any way violate [Billmayer\u2019s] constitutional property rights.\u201d Billmayer appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b270-8\">\u00b611 We review a district court\u2019s denial of an injunction to determine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>whether the district court manifestly abused its discretion. <em>Shammel v. Canyon Resources Corp., </em>2003 MT 372, \u00b6 12, 319 Mont. 132, \u00b6 12, 82 P.3d 912, \u00b6 12. We review a district court\u2019s findings of fact to determine whether they are clearly erroneous. <em>Kane v. Morgan, </em>2001 MT 182, \u00b6 5, 306 Mont. 207, \u00b6 5, 32 P.3d 747, \u00b6 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">\u00b612 <em>Whether the District Court manifestly abused its discretion in denying Billmayer\u2019s request for injunctive relief?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">\u00b613 Section 2-6-102, MCA, grants \u201ccitizens\u201d the \u201cright to inspect and copy public writings.\u201d The parties agree that the floodplain documents are subject to the disclosure rules of \u00a7 2-6-102, MCA, in light of the fact that the documents qualify as \u201cpublic writings\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 2-6-101(2), MCA. Section 2-6-102, MCA, provides, in relevant part, that \u201c[ejvery citizen has a right to inspect and take a copy of any public writings of this state, except as provided in ... subsection (3) of this section ....\u201d Billmayer contends that his proprietary interest in the floodplain study documents triggers the exception to public disclosure in Subsection (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">\u00b614 Subsection (3) states that \u201c[r]ecords and materials that are constitutionally protected from disclosure are not subject to the provisions of this section.\u201d Section 2-6-102(3), MCA. Subsection (3) defines \u201c[^Information that is constitutionally protected\u201d as \u201cinformation in which there is an individual privacy interest that clearly exceeds the merits of public disclosure, including legitimate trade secrets, as defined in 30-14-402, and matters related to individual or public safety.\u201d Section 2-6-102(3), MCA. Billmayer argues, specifically, that the District Court erred in finding that his documents were not \u201ctrade secrets.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b271-8\">\u00b615 Section 30-14-402, MCA, defines a trade secret as \u201cinformation or computer software, including a formula, pattern, compilation, program, device, method, technique, or process, that ... derives independent economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable by proper means by, other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use.\u201d Section 30-14-402(4)(a), MCA. The statute also requires that the \u201ctrade secret\u201d be \u201cthe subject of efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy.\u201d Section 30-14-402(4)(b), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-9\">\u00b616  Billmayer admits that he has \u201cno objection to the public viewing\u201d his records. His efforts have been directed, in fact, solely at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>restricting the photocopying of his floodplain study, not at maintaining its confidentiality. Thus, Billmayer has failed to prove that his documents are \u201cnot... readily ascertainable\u201d by anyone who wishes to view them, and he has made no \u201creasonable efforts\u201d to maintain his documents\u2019 secrecy. Section 30-14-402(4), MCA. The District Court was not clearly erroneous in finding that \u201cthe data and information contained in the documents has been disclosed, [and] is not confidential....\u201d <em>Kane, </em>\u00b6 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">\u00b617 Billmayer relies on <em>Taco Cabana Intern., Inc. v. Two Pesos, </em>Inc., 932 F.2d 1113, 1124 (5th Cir. 1991), for the proposition that filing documents with a public agency does not defeat a trade secret. The court in <em>Taco Cabana </em>held that the district court correctly had instructed the jury that the \u201c Tfliling of architectural plans with a city does not make them public information within the context of secrecy that relates to the law of trade secrets.\u2019 \u201d <em>Taco Cabana, </em>932 F.2d at 1124. Billmayer misplaces his reliance on <em>Taco Cabana. </em>The District Court found that Billmayer had failed to protect his trade secret in light of the fact that he admitted that the public has been free to examine the documents for years, not because he filed his documents with the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">\u00b618 Billmayer alleges in the alternative that he has a right to restrict the copying of the flood plan study documents pursuant to a federal copyright. Billmayer first raised the issue of federal copyright protection late in the District Court proceedings when he filed a \u201cNotice of Copyright Protection\u201d along with his \u201cPost-Hearing Brief.\u201d He stated in an attached affidavit that he had \u201cinitiated formal legal steps to register and secure federal copyright protection of all those maps and other documents that I prepared for [Springcreek].\u201d He asserted in his \u201cPost-Hearing Brief\u2019 that \u201c[m]atters of federal copyright law are beyond the scope of this Court\u2019s jurisdiction and this Court\u2019s request for [post-hearing] briefing.\u201d Billmayer stated, however, that he \u201cis prepared, if requested by the Court, to substantiate with additional legal briefing the legitimacy of his right to pursue and attach federal copyright protection for these documents at this time The record shows no \u201cadditional legal briefing\u201d on the issue of a Billmayer\u2019s alleged \u201cfederal copyright.\u201d Accordingly, the District Court refused to \u201cspeculate or find that [Schwarz\u2019s] contemplated use of the data contained in the documents would... possibly violate copyright <em>law...\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"AUq\">\u00b619 Billmayer attempts to resuscitate his federal copyright arguments on appeal with oblique references to federal copyright concepts such as \u201cfair-use\u201d and citations to case law on the \u201ccommon law copyright.\u201d The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>passage of the 1976 Copyright Act preempted the legal concept of common law copyright. <em>See e.g.,Roth v. Pritikin, </em>710 F.2d 934, 938-39 (2nd Cir. 1983). We need not unravel Billmayer\u2019s federal copyright arguments on appeal as he has failed to present adequately this issue to the District Court. <em>Allen v. Atlantic Richfield Co., </em>2005 MT 281, \u00b6 20, 329 Mont. 230, \u00b6 20, 124 P.3d 132, \u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">\u00b620  Billmayer argues lastly that the District Court failed to engage in the constitutional balancing analysis required by \u00a7 2-6-102(3), MCA. He has failed to identify a \u201clegitimate trade secret,\u201d or any other recognized \u201cindividual privacy interest,\u201d however, that the court could have balanced against the \u201cmerits of public disclosure\u201d as required by \u00a7 2-6-102(3), MCA. He also has failed to establish a basis upon which the court could have determined that the photocopying of his documents would deprive him of his property without due process. <em>Cf. Great Falls Trib. v. Mont. Public Ser. Com., </em>2003 MT 359, \u00b6 59, 319 Mont. 38, \u00b6 59, 82 P.3d 876, \u00b6 59 (holding that a court must consider whether disclosure of documents pursuant to Montana Constitution Article II, Section 9 would constitute a \u201c \u2018taking\u2019 in the constitutional sense.\u201d). The District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Billmayer\u2019s application for injunction under these circumstances. <em>Shammel, </em>\u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">\u00b621 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b273-6\">JUSTICES WARNER, COTTER, NELSON and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
