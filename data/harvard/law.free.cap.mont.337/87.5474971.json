We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">\u00b62 The issue on appeal is whether the District Court erred in affirming the Justice Court\u2019s denial of Vincent\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal at the close of the State\u2019s evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">\u00b63 On September 16, 2004, a Lewis and Clark County Sheriffs deputy stopped Vincent and subsequently cited him for driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs (DUI), second offense. Vincent made an initial appearance in Justice Court the next day. A week later, he entered a plea of not guilty. On November 24, 2004, at the omnibus hearing, Vincent requested a bench trial before the Justice Court, the State did not object and a trial before the Justice of the Peace was ordered. The Lewis and Clark County Commissioners have designated the Justice Court as a court of record under \u00a7 3-10-101(5), MCA. On December 15, 2004, Vincent filed a written motion to suppress the evidence against him based on the lack of a particularized suspicion for the officer to stop and question him. Vincent\u2019s motion indicated that a supporting brief would be filed within five days as required by Rule 6(c), Montana Uniform Rules for the Justice and City Courts (MURJCC). However, no brief was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">\u00b64 On January 19,2005, the Justice Court entered an order denying Vincent\u2019s motion to suppress based on Rule 6(c), MURJCC. Rule 6(c) provides in relevant part: \u201cFailure to file a brief within five days by the moving party shall be deemed an admission that the motion is without merit.\u201d Rule 6(a), MURJCC, makes clear that the Rule applies to criminal as well as civil cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">\u00b65 The trial was held February 11, 2005. At the close of the State\u2019s case, Vincent made a motion for judgment of acquittal due to insufficiency of the evidence. The Justice Court denied Vincent\u2019s motion and found him guilty of DUI. Vincent appealed to the District Court. The District Court affirmed the judgment of the Justice Court. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-8\">\u00b66 In an appeal from a justice court established as a court of record, the district court functions as an appellate court and the appeal is confined to a review of the record and questions of law. Section 3-10-115, MCA. Both the district comb and this Court review the justice court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and its legal conclusions for correctness. <em>Stanley v. Lemire, </em>2006 MT 304, \u00b6 25, 334 Mont. 489, \u00b6 25, 148 P.3d 643, \u00b6 25 (quoting <em>City of Billings v. Costa, </em>2006 MT 181, \u00b6 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>7, 333 Mont. 84, \u00b6 7, 140 P.3d 1070, \u00b6 7).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\">\u00b67 The State\u2019s evidence at trial consisted primarily of the testimony of the arresting officer. Vincent argues that because the arresting officer did not have particularized suspicion to stop him, all of the officer\u2019s testimony was inadmissible at trial. Therefore, Vincent argues, the officer\u2019s testimony concerning Vincent\u2019s intoxicated condition could not be considered by the Justice of the Peace acting as the finder of fact under \u00a7 46-16-403, MCA. Thus, when the officer\u2019s testimony is excluded, there is insufficient evidence to convict him.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">\u00b68 The State responds by arguing that because Vincent conceded that his pre-trial suppression motion based on lack of particularized suspicion was without merit, he was precluded from raising this same argument in support of a motion for judgment of acquittal. The State also argues that by waiting to reassert the defense that the officer did not have the required particularized suspicion to stop him until the close of its case in chief, such defense was waived pursuant to \u00a7 46-13-101, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">\u00b69  As noted above in \u00b6 4, Rule 6(c), MURJCC, specifically says that failure of the moving party to file a brief in support of a motion within five days shall be deemed an admission that the motion is without merit. We will not fault a Justice Court where, as here, it follows a mandatory requirement of applicable rules. The Justice Court did not err in denying Vincent\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">\u00b610 Vincent\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal on the grounds that the arresting officer lacked the required particularized suspicion to stop him is precluded by \u00a7 46-13-101, MCA. Section 46-13-101, MCA, provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-8\">(1) Except for good cause shown, any defense, objection, or request that is capable of determination without trial of the general issue must be raised at or before the omnibus hearing unless otherwise provided by Title 46.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-9\">(2) Failure of a party to raise defenses or objections or to make requests that must be made prior to trial, at the time set by the court, constitutes a waiver of the defense, objection, or request.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b115-10\">\u00b611 The issue of whether particularized suspicion existed to stop Vincent is capable of determination without trial of the general issue of whether he is guilty of DUI. Therefore, \u00a7 46-13-101, MCA, mandates that such a defense be brought at or before the omnibus hearing, or, at the latest, by a subsequent date ordered by the court. The consequence for failure to do so is clear: \u201c[a] party\u2019s failure to raise matters which are capable of determination without trial and required to be raised at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>or before the omnibus hearing constitutes a waiver.\u201d <em>State v. VonBergen, </em>2003 MT 265, \u00b6 11, 317 Mont. 445, \u00b6 11, 77 P.3d 537, \u00b6 11 (quoting <em>State v. Griffing, </em>1998 MT 75, \u00b6 10, 288 Mont. 213, \u00b6 10, 955 P.2d 1388, \u00b6 10).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">\u00b612  When Vincent made his motion at the end of the State\u2019s case, it was too late to seek a judgment of acquittal based on a defense that could have been made before trial. The District Court did not err in affirming the judgment of the Justice Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">\u00b613 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b116-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES LEAPHART, COTTER and NELSON concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
