The charging part of the indictment is as follows: \u201cOscar Dudley * * * did then and there unlawfully in and upon Pearl Hyden, who was then and there a female under the age of fifteen years, make 'an assault, with the intent then and there to commit the offense of rape upon the said Pearl Hyden, by then and there attempting to have carnal knowledge of the said Pearl Hyden.\u201d It is contended that this indictment .is fatally defective in failing to charge that the assaulted female was not the wife of the d\u00e9fendant. This identical question came before us in the case of Edwards v. State, ante p. 242, on motion for rehearing, at our recent Dallas term. It was there held that in cases of assault with intent to <em>rape, </em>the indictment must negative the fact that the girl was the wife of the accused. Eor proper form of indictment in this character of case, see White\u2019s Ann. Penal Code, \u00a7 1101. Under the authority of Edwards v. State, and authorities there cited, the judgment in this case is reversed, and the prosecution ordered dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"An1\">\n<em>Reversed and Dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">Hurt, Presiding Judge, absent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
