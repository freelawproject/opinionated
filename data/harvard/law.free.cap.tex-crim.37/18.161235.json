At the April, 1895, term of said court, a forfeiture was taken upon said bond. Citation having been served on said sureties, all of the defendants appeared at the November, 1895, term of the said court and answered, alleging, in substance, that said judgment nisi should not be made final, because (1) there was no indictment on file at the time the bond was executed, (2) said bond bound Moseley to appear at a .time when ho term of the court could be held under the law, (3) said bond appears to hai e been taken in term time and the bond does not show the offense charged was a misdemeanor, (4) that said Moseley had been surrendered by said bondsmen to the sheriff of said county, and (5) Moseley had not appeared at the time the forfeiture was taken, solely because of an agreement made with the District Attorney for the dismissal of the case. The court, after hearing the evidence and overruling all of defendant\u2019s exceptions thereto, overruled the answer and made the judgment final for the sum of $50.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b37-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number><em>Cleve Coffee </em>and <em>Browning </em>&amp; <em>Madden, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A3C\">The court erred in admitting, over the defendant\u2019s objections, the judgment nisi and bond herein; because,</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b37-5\">\u201c1.

W. Huber, and S. G. Carter, the two latter being sureties. The bail bond is in the sum of $200, but the judgment final was rendered for $50. Appellants, in their first bill of exceptions, raise the question as to the action of the court in permitting the State to show on the final ttral that the bond was in fact taken and approved on the 2nd day of May, 1894, instead of the 2nd of April, 1894, as recited in the scire facias. The scire facias in such case answers the purpose of a petition and citation. If there is a mistake in the date of the bond, this can be explained by proper allegations in the scire facias, and parol proof can be received to correct such mistakes. But where the scire facias alleges that the bond was executed on a certain day, without further explanations, no bond is admissible which does not bear the date set forth in the scire facias. In this case, the bond, as shown by the scire facias, bears date the 2nd of April, 1894; and, in the absence of some allegation, parol evidence was not admissible to show another date than that recited in the scire facias. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>See, Avant v. State, 33 Tex. Crim. Rep., 312; Bailey v. State, 22 S. W. Rep., 40. Where a bond is dated, and is afterwards approved by the sheriff on a different day, the date of the bond, and not the date of the approval, controls. See, Holt v. State, 20 Tex. Crim. App., 271. The judgment nisi should show when the bail bond or recognizance requires the party to appear, etc. See, Willson\u2019s Forms. This is not done' in the judgment before us. If we refer to the bond, it is shown that the principal was to appear before the District Court at a time when no court could be legally holden in Roberts County. Said bond was void on this account. Douglass v. State, 26 Tex. Crim. App., 248. The-judgment is reversed, and the prosecution ordered dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">\n<em>Reversed arid Ordered Dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
