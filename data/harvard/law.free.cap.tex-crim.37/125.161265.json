The transcript contains Avhat purports to be a statement of facts. The statement of facts is not signed by counsel, nor approved by the judge. It concludes, \u201cYours, etc. S. C. Counts.\u201d We cannot consider the statement. There is but one question in the record, and that is as to the sufficiency of the information. In the language of Mr. N. P. Jackson, who briefed the case for the State: \u201cIf the information is not sufficient, it ought to be. It is full enough for six, charging everything from organization of the county to notice of appeal in this case, including everything embraced in the local option law from the petition to the proclamation\u2014all that Stoivart\u2019s case, 35 Tex. Crim. Rep., -392, or that Steel\u2019s case (Tex. Crim. App.), 30 S. W. Rep., 1064, ever dreamed of. In fact, it contains everything it should, and a vast deal it could do without, but which does not hurt it. It\u2019s all right. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>In the matter complained of about the charge, I think the charge is satisfactory, in the absence of a statement of facts. It expounds the local option law most learnedly, in connection with a most exciting history of that branch of our jurisprudence, and is, in addition, most gravely and reverentially signed, \u2018Yours respectfully, G. W. Dakan, Oo. Judge.\u2019 \u201d There appearing no errors in the record, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
