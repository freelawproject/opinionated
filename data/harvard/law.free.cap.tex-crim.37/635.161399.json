He was not a guard, because not appointed in conformity with law. Rev. Stat., Art. 4898. He was not a de facto constable, because such deputy could not be appointed in a city or town containing a less population than 8000. He was simply a private citizen placed in charge of a prisoner, without any known authority of law, and defendant violated no law in offering to bribe him to let him escape.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b653-12\">Appeal from the District Court of Tarrant.

The law, as contained in Art. 133, Penal Code, does not apply to the prisoner himself, it being as follows: \u201cIf any person shall bribe, or offer to bribe, any sheriff or other peace officer, to permit any prisoner in his custody to escape, he shall be punished, etc.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b653-18\">2. The indictment charges no offense against appellant, for the reason that there is no such peace officer known to the law as Glazener is alleged to have been, and there was not sufficient evidence to support the verdict and judgment, for the reason that it failed to show that said Glazener was an officer known to the law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b653-19\">3.

Doughty\u2019s case, 33 Texas, 1. Had he accepted the bribe he would have been guilty of the offense defined by Article 141 (old Article 136), of the Penal Code, and punishable thereunder. Florez v. State, 11 Tex. Crim. App., 102; Moseley\u2019s case, 25 Tex. Crim. App., 515.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b654-4\">A posse comitatus for the time being is a peace officer. Under the circumstances of this case, the private person could not have been compelled to act as a posse comitatus, but having consented, he was a posse comitatus, and hence a peace officer, charged with the powers and responsibilities of such peace officer. Doughty\u2019s case, supra.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b654-5\">For the time being and for the purpose of guarding the defendant, the private person was a deputy constable and guard de facto. As such he was a peace officer, within the purview of the statute, and the subject of the offense therein defined, and the defendant cannot be heard to question the regularity or legality of his appointment. Florez\u2019s case, supra.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b654-6\">Had the private person accepted the bribe, in this case, he could not have pleaded against prosecution under Article 141, that he was not legally a peace officer. Moseley\u2019s case, supra.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b654-7\">HURT, Presiding Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"ASI\">Appellant was convicted for offering to</p>\n<p id=\"ACD\">bribe Joe Glazener to permit him (appellant), being a prisoner, to escape, and his punishment assessed at two years in the penitentiary; hence this appeal. The indictment alleges that \u201cGlazener was a deputy constable of precinct number two of Tarrant county, Texas; a peace officer, and guard of the defendant.\u201d The statute under which this conviction was obtained reads (Art. 138, Penal Code, 1895): \u201cIf any person shall bribe or offer to bribe any sheriff, or other peace officer, to permit any prisoner in his custody to escape, he shall be punished by impris<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>onment in the penitentiary for a term of not less than two nor more than five years.\u201d If Glazener was a peace officer, having the custody of the prisoner, he was subject to bribery. The indictment alleged that he was a peace officer. Now, to determine whether he was a peace officer or not, we must first ascertain who are peace officers. Art. 43, Code Crim. Proc., 1895, defines peace officers. It reads as follows: \u201cThe following are peace officers: The sheriff and his deputies; constables; marshal, constable and policemen of any incorporated town or city, and any private person especially appointed to execute criminal process.\u201d It is not contended that Glazener was a sheriff, deputy sheriff, constable; marshal, constable, or policeman of any incorporated town or city. It appears from the record\u2014and there is no conflict about the testimony, so far as this point is concerned\u2014that the constable of Precinct No. 2 of Tarrant County had arrested appellant upon a charge of felony. Appellant desired to see his friends in order to make a bond. The constable placed him in charge of Glazener, a citizen. Glazener accompanied the prisoner to several places in the town of Arlington, in said precinct. While at the rear of a saloon, appellant proposed to give Glazener $50 to let him run. This offer was rejected by Glazener. Glazener being neither a sheriff, deputy sheriff, constable, marshal, constable, or policeman of an incorporated town, was he a private person specially appointed to execute criminal process? If so, he was the subject of bribery, because he was a peace officer. He was not executing any criminal process, the process having been executed by the constable. He was not appointed to execute any criminal process, as is provided for by Art. 266, Code Crim. Proc., 1895. He was not a guard, within contemplation of the Code, because the statute directs how guards shall be appointed. See, Art. 4898, Rev. Stat., 1895. He was simply a private citizen placed in charge of a prisoner without any authority of law known to us. He was not a peace officer, because he does not come within the statutory definition of such an officer. He was not, therefore, subject to bribery, under Art. 140 of the Penal Code. The indictment alleges that Glazener was a deputy constable. The constable testified that Glazener was neither sheriff, deputy sheriff, constable or deputy constable, nor policeman of any incorporated town, at the time he turned defendant over to him. The town of Arlington, situated in said Precinct No. 2, contains a population of not more than 1200 people. But concede that it contained over eight thousand inhabitants; Glazener was not appointed deputy constable. This is established beyond all question by the evidence of the constable. As before stated, the indictment charges that Glazener was a deputy constable, and interweaves in this connection that he was a peace officer and guard. We are at a loss to know whether he was a peace officer by virtue of being a deputy constable, or independent of his deputation as such. But this is altogether immaterial, because he is neither a constable nor deputy constable, nor was he a person deputized to serve criminal process, as before stated. We are of opinion that the convic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>tion is wrong; that appellant violated no law of this State in offering to bribe a citizen to let him escape. The statute having defined peace officers\u2014making it an offense to bribe such officer\u2014to convict, the party must be brought within the provisions of the statute. We are not now discussing the question of de facto officers, Glazener being neither an officer de juro or de facto. He could not be a de facto deputy constable, because the law does not permit the appointment of such deputy in a city containing a less population than 8000. See, Art. 4908, Rev. Stat., 1895. The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">\n<em>Reversed and Remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
