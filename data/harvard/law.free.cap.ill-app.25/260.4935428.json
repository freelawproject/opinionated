By articles of co-partnership executed by the parties under their hands and seals, it was provided that the business of said firm should be that of buying hogs or hog products, and curing, packing and shipping the same to J. T. Davies &amp; Company, at Liverpool, for sale on account of the firm of Davies, Atkinson &amp; Company, on commission; also of buying provisions on commission for shipment to the continenfc of Europe and elsewhere. Said articles of co-partnership further provided that Atkinson should attend to the business of the firm; that he should draw from the firm not to exceed $2,500 semi-annually, the sum so drawn to be charged against his share of the profits; that during the existence of the co-partnership Atkinson should not buy, sell, speculate with or mortgage any firm assets, except as required in the ordinary co-partnership business, and should not engage in any speculations or business ventures on his own account, outside of the business of the firm, without the consent of Davies; that for all sums of money or assets put into the business of the firm by Davies, he should be allowed interest at the rate of five per cent, per annum, payable semi-annually; that the money and assets put into the business by Davies should remain his sole property, the firm to have the use of and pay interest on the same; Davies to have the power at any time to draw out such sum or sums of money from said business as he should choose, and to loan the firm such sums of money or assets as he should think proper; that the profits of the business, after paying interest and expenses, should be apportioned, two-thirds to Davies and one-third to Atkinson; that all business should be conducted under the cognizance and by the direction of Davies, and that there should be kept perfect, just and true books of account, in which should be entered all the transactions of the firm, and to which both partners should have free access; that within thirty days from Marchlst and October 1st of each year, Atkinson should render to Davies a true, just and perfect account of all the profits by them or either of them made, and all losses by them or either of them sustained, and also all payments, receipts, disbursements, and all other things by them made, received, disbursed, acted, done or suffered in said co-partnership; that the co-partnership'might be terminated by Davies at any time by giving Atkinson three months\u2019 notice in writing; that at the termination of the partnership, the partners should make to each other a true, just and final account of all things relating to said business and adjust the same, and distribute the assets of the firm.</summary><summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b256-4\" pgmap=\"256\">Atkinson was substantially without means, and all the money and property to be used in the business of the firm was furnished by Davies, with the exception of \u00a750,000 belonging to Atkinson\u2019s mother, which was borrowed by the firm, and for which the partners agreed in the articles of co-partnership to pay her six per cent, interest. The firm, after its organization, carried on a very large business, Atkinson being the managing partner, Davies in the meanwhile residing in Liverpool and caz-zying on business there on his own account zznder the name of J. T. Davies &amp; Company, and only occasionally visiting Chicago. Atkinson was a member of the Board of Trade of Chicago and made various purchases for his firm on said Board with the knowledge and approval of Davies. During all the time the business was in progress he kept no individual bank account, but was in - the habit of drawing checks on the firzn account, to sozne extent at least, for his individual debts, as well as for the debts of the firzzz.</summary><summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b256-5\" pgmap=\"256\">In the sumzizer of 1884 he embarked in various large speculations on said Board on his own account, withozit the knowledge or consent of Davies, and said speculations having resulted in laz-ge losses, he paid said losses by drawing checks on the bank account of the firm in favor of the members of the Board to whom such losses were due. The amount of the losses so paid, as is now claimed, was ziearly \u00a740,000.</summary><summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b256-6\" pgmap=\"256(141) 257(202)\">After these 'things had occuzTed, Davies came to Chicago, arriving October 3, 1884. Iznmediately on his arrival he received a letter from Atkinson confessing his misappropriation of the moneys of the firm. Davies thereupon took into his possession a large amount of the firm assets, of the value of about \u00a7125,000, and shipped them to Liverpool and converted them into cash. On the 23d day of October, 1884, after having disposed of that amount of the firzn property, he filed his bill against Atkinson alone, alleging that Atkinson, in violation of said articles of co-partnez\u2019ship, had fraudulently and secretly entered into various gaznbiing transactions on said Board of Trade on his own account, and that in payment of losses sustained in said transactions he had drawn checks upon the bank account of the firzn to the amount of neazly \u00a74),000, the respective amounts of said checks and the names of the various persons, in whose favor they were drawn, being particularly stated; that said Atkinson had fraudulently concealed said transactions from the-complainant; that at the time of the misappropriation of said moneys there was nothing standing to the credit of Atkinson on the firm books, and on a settlement of the firm accounts there would be nothing due ,him; that he had made other fraudulent misappropriations of the moneys of the firm to a large amount; that there were various debts due to and from the firm, and that a portion of the firm property was of a perishable nature; that the complainant furnished all the capital invested in said business and that Atkinson was interested only in the profits; that Atkinson was insolvent and had abandoned the business of the firm, and that he had received out of the assets and property of the firm a large sum in excess of his due proportion of said profits. Said bill prayed for an accounting, for a receiver, for a conversion of the partnership assets into money and for a final adjustment of the partnership affairs.</summary><summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b257-4\" pgmap=\"257\">A receiver was appointed in said suit, who realized out of the assets of the firm the sum of \u00a756,913.95, and the debts proved up against the estate of said firm amounted to $106,-882.73, of which \u00a797,818.13 consisted of a claim in favor of the Bank of Montreal, and by order of the court the money in the hands of the receiver was applied to the satisfaction of said claims.</summary><summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b257-5\" pgmap=\"257(133) 258(45)\">Said Atkinson appeared and answered said bill, and afterward, on the 26th day of January, 1885, said Davies filed his petition in said suit representing that he had then lately commenced an action of account against said Atkinson in the Superior Court of ca/pias ad respondendum and had caused said Atkinson to be arrested on said capias and held to bail, and that he was desirous of availing himself of the advantages he might derive from said proceeding by capias and said bail, as well as the benefit he might derive from the prosecution of said action, and praying to be permitted to elect to proceed with said action to its final termination, and that the proceedings in the matter of said bill, so far as they related to an accounting between the complainant and said Atkinson, bo stayed until the final termination of said action; and an order was thereupon entered granting the prayer of said petition and staying the accounting in the chancery suit until the determination of the suit at law.</summary><summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b258-5\" pgmap=\"258\">On the 15th day of May, 1886, Davies filed an amended and supplemental bill, naming as defendants the several parties to whom Atkinson gave the checks above mentioned in payment of his losses on the Board of Trade, alleging that said checks were given by Atkinson to pay his individual debts and that said debts consisted of Ms losses in certain gambling transactions; that the parties to whom said checks were given received them with notice that the funds against which they were drawn belonged to the firm, and that said moneys were paid to them for Atkinson\u2019s individual debts and in fraud of the complainant\u2019s rights, and praying that said several parties be decreed to pay over to the receiver, or to the complainant, all moneys by them received belonging to said firm. Said amended and supplemental hill was taken as confessed, as against Atkinson, but the other defendants answered, denying the equity of said bill, and alleging, among other things, that said moneys were paid to them by said Atkinson with Davies\u2019 knowledge and consent, and that such payments had been ratified and confirmed by Mm.</summary><summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b258-6\" pgmap=\"258\">On the 18th day of May, 1886, three days after the filing of the amended and supplemental hill, Davies and Atkinson settled and compromised all their differences growing out of said co-partnership without any accounting in any judicial proceeding or otherwise, and as the evidence of such compromise and settlement they executed an agreement in writing which, after reciting various considerations, contained the following stipulations :</summary><summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b258-7\" pgmap=\"258(60) 259(114)\">\u201cThe undersigned, John T.

Carver, 42 III. 66, the acts of ratification were positive in their character as well as by lapse of time. The lapse of time in that case was four years between the payment and the suit, while in this case it is only a year and a half. It was not simply a question of mere delay in that case. It does not appear that either the individual parties or the partnership was insolvent at the time of the transaction. The other members of the co-partnership had conversations with the individual creditors, and did not repudiate the transaction. All the acts of the parties were of a nature to ratify the transaction.</p><p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b261-7\" pgmap=\"261\">In the case at bar no conversation was had between Davies and these parties; not one word was spoken; the partnership and Atkinson were insolvent, and these defendants knew the money they received was the money of the firm, to which they had no right; they simply united with Atkinson in robbing the firm, and now attempt to keep their plunder by taking advantage of their own fraud.</p><p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b261-8\" pgmap=\"261\">The Supreme Court in the Carver case said: \u201cWe are obliged to regard the actual facts as amounting to a ratification.\u201d And that case decides nothing else, and whatever else may have been said was obiter dicta.</p><attorneys data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b262-4\" pgmap=\"262\">Messrs.

Had-duck, 3 Gilm. 233.</p><p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b262-7\" pgmap=\"262\">These defendants, within the authorities of the Supreme Court of this State, are bona fide purchasers for value, and their defense on that ground can not be successfully attacked, unless the mere fact that Atkinson did not use the firm name in buying and selling on the Board of Trade, amounted to notice that the debt contracted in the line of the business of the firm was the debt of the individual partner.</p><p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b262-8\" pgmap=\"262\">The presumption of notice does not arise under all circumstances, even where the debt paid out of partnership funds appears in form to be the individual debt of one partner. Here the mere using of Atkinson\u2019s name in the trades, without further explanation, and the giving these checks on the firm, the whole being in the business line of the firm, of buying and selling on the Board, the whole being characterized in the evidence as in the usual course of business, can not be fairly claimed to have established a case of constructive notice. These checks were given as money. They simply served to transfer so much money at once. In their brief existence they pass from one to another and are more negotiable than promissory notes. There is every reason of c&lt; m.nercial policy, of business necessity, why these defendants should be protected. Wiley v. Allen, 26 Ga. 563; Darlington v. Garrett, 14 Ill. App. 238; Duncan v.

All of said moneys were paid out by Atkinson prior to October 3, 1884, and on that day Davies, the complainant, was notified of such misappropriation of the partnership funds, and at least as early as October 23, 1884, the date of the filing the original bill, Davies was fully informed of all the facts in relation to such misappropriation, as said bill avers specifically the several sums misappropriated, the various parties to .whom the same had been paid and the account upon which such payments had been made. To the original bill Atkinson alone was made a defendant, and the object of that bill was to obtain an accounting and settlement of the co-partnership affairs upon the basis of charging Atkinson, in the statement of the account, with the several sums of money so misappropriated by him. Ho attempt was made to reach said funds in the hands of the parties to whom they had been paid, or in any way to question the validity of such payments, so far as they were concerned, until' May 15, 1886, the date of-filing the amended and supplemental bill. Thus, for nearly nineteen months after obtaining full knowledge of all the facts, Davies acquiesced in the right of the parties now sought to be charged, to hold the moneys paid to them by Atkinson, and we are of the opinion that, upon well settled principles of law, he must be deemed to have ratified and confirmed the acts of his co-partner in paying said moneys to the defendants.</p> <p id=\"b265-4\" pgmap=\"265(344) 266(182)\">The legal principles involved seem to us to be settled by 'the decisions of the Supreme Court in Marine Co. v. Carver, 42 Ill. 66, and Casey v. Carver, 42 Ill. 225. In Marine Co. v. Carver, suit was brought by Carver &amp; Company against the Marine Company, a banking institution, to recover the amount of a firm deposit which Carver, one of the co-partners, had misapplied to the payment of his individual debt to the bank-It appears that the firm, learning of said misappropriation of its funds, sent to the bank for a statement of its account, which was given, and the check by which the money had been drawn and appropriated to Carver\u2019s individual account returned to the firm. The check was returned by Carver &amp; Company, and after a lapse of nearly four years they, without any previous attempt to repudiate such misappropriation of the funds, brought suit to recover said money from the bank. The court, in holding that no such recovery could be had, say: \u201c If the firm of Carver &amp; Company had repudiated his act and returned the check, they would have thus advised the Marine Company that, in the opinion of his co-partners, Carver was unworthy of credit, and this would have induced that company to make an effort for the collection of its debt. But the apparent acquiescence of the co-partners of Carver would indicate their own confidence in his pecuniary solvency, and thus tend to strengthen his credit with the Marine Company and lull it into a false security. In cases of this character it if to be remembered that the duties and obligations between the members of a partnership and third persons are reciprocal. While it is true that one partner can not rightfully appropriate the partnership funds in payment of his individual indebtedness, yet it is equally true that, if he does not so appropriate them, his acts, when they come to the knowledge of the other members of the firm, should be clearly and promptly repudiated. At least no room should be left for doubt in the minds of parties concerned as to whether the act is repudiated or ratified. Good faith requires this, for co-partners must necessarily understand the pecuniary condition of each other better than third persons can do, and if they seem to ratify an act of one of their firm, originally unauthorized, it is a declaration in his behalf that he possesses their confidence and is entitled to credit. In Casey v. Carver, the same rule is recognized. It is there said : \u201c Had it appeared that his partners knew of the settlement, or knew or had reason to suppose that appellants were relying upon the settlement, they could not be heard to repudiate the settlement unless they have given notice that they did not sanction the settlement, at the e irliest practicable period after they learned the facts. To permit them, after acquiescing in the settlement for any great length of time after notice, to repudiate it, would be a fraud on the creditor of the individual partner.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b266-7\" pgmap=\"266(230) 267(42)\">But we think the rules established by the foregoing cases may also be sustained upon well recognized principles of the law of agency, apart from considerations drawn from the peculiar relations existing between partners. Each partner is the agent of his firm, and it is a familiar rule of the law of agency that, where the relation of principal and agent exists, the principal must disavow the unauthorized act of his agent within a reasonable time, or his silence will be held to be a ratification. Thus it is laid down by Chancellor Kent, that, \u201cWhen the principal is informed of what has been done he must dissent and give notice of it within a reasonable time, and if he does not his assent and ratification will be presumed.\u201d 2 Kent Com., 616. In Bred in v. Dubary, 14 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 27, it is said by Hr. Justice Gibson: \u201cI take it to be indisputable, that a principal who neglects promptly to disavow an act of his agent, by which the latter has transcended his authority, makes it his own; he is bound to disavow it the first moment the fact comes to his knowledge.\u201d Kelsey v. National Bank, 69 Pa. St. 426. \u201cThe principal must, when informed, reject within a reasonable time, or be deemed to adopt by acquiescence.\u201d Law v. Cross, 1 Black, 592. See, also, Walker v. Walker, 7 Baxt. 260; Peck v. Ritchey, 66 Mo. 114; Western &amp; Atlantic R. R. Co. v. McElwee, 6 Heisk. 208; Norris v. Cook, 1 Curtis C. C. 464; Story on Agency, Sec. 258; Wharton on Agency, Sec. 86.</p> <p id=\"b267-4\" pgmap=\"267\">Atkinson being not only a partner but the managing partner of the firm, was an agent haying the custody, control and power to dispose of the partnership property. The partnership funds Were in his hands, and he had authority to deposit them in bank, and to check them out for all purposes within the purview of the partnership business. He had no authority to check them out to pay his individual debts, and his doing so was clearly in excess of his authority and in violation of his duty as agent. But his unauthorized acts would seem to invoke an application of the same rule which obtains in case of other agents. The failure of his firm, or of the partner who was injured, to promptly repudiate his unauthorized act, must, as to third persons, be held to be a ratification.</p> <p id=\"b267-5\" pgmap=\"267(219) 268(67)\">But there is another reason equally cogent why the decree for dismissing the bill must be affirmed. Ho account has been stated between Davies and Atkinson, and there is, therefore, no basis in the evidence for holding that Ackinson has withdrawn from the firm, for the payment of his individual debts, anything beyond his distributive share of the firm assets. If he has not, there are no equitable reasons why his creditors should restore the moneys so paid them. Ho creditor of the firm is complaining, and it does not clearly appear that there was any firm indebtedness outstanding at the date of the decree. The only possible basis for a recovery by Davies from Atkinson\u2019s creditors of the moneys received by them in payment of Atkinson\u2019s individual indebtedness is, that those moneys are required in order to give Davies his share of the firm assets. What that share is, and whether anything will be due him on final settlement, can only be determined upon an accounting between him and Atkinson. The accounting in the chancery suit was stayed on Davies\u2019 own petition, he having elected to pursue his remedy at law by action of account. A settlement and compromise between him and Atkinson having been effected, the action of account was dismissed by stipulation, and Atkinson released from all personal liability to Davies, and no further steps have been taken either at law or in chancery to obtain a statement of the account. between said co-partners. An accounting was an indispensable prerequisite to the relief sought by the amended and supplemental bill, and there being no accounting, the court could not do otherwise than dismiss the bill. The decree will be affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b268-5\" pgmap=\"268\">Decree affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
