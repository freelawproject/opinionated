E. Montgomery, of Springfield, Illinois, of the first part, and W. H. Milligan, of Pinkney ville, Ill., and D. T. McIlvane, of Willeys, Ill., known and doing business under the firm name of Milligan &amp; McIlvane, party of the second part, witnesseth: That the said Montgomery agrees to furnish the following described tract of pasture land, to wit: The N. E. \u00bc of Sec. 23; S. E. \u00bc of Sec. 28; S. \u00bd N. E. \u00bc of Sec. 28; W. \u00bd N. W. \u00bc of Sec. 27; W. \u00bd S. W. \u00bc of Sec. 27, Tp. 15 N., R. 2, W. of 3rd P. M., Christian County, Ill., and containing 440 acres, more or less, at the sum of twelve hundred dollars, and he is also to furnish five thousand dollars (\u00a75,000) in money, one-half by April 1, 1885, and one-half by May 1, 1885, to be used as follows: The said Milligan &amp; McIlvane are to purchase five thousand dollars (\u00a75,000) worth of young, growing, healthy cattle, to stock said pasture for Montgomery to consume the season\u2019s grass on the same, and to act as selling agents for Montgomery. Said cattle are to be marketed at the close of the grazing season, not later than December 1, 1885, to the best advantage. And it is further agreed that said second parties are to receive and accept for then' services in attending to said business for Montgomery, the profit that shall accrue from said deal, after Montgomery shall be paid the sum of twelve hundred dollars for said pasture on or before December 1,1885, with 8 per cent, interest, after that date, till paid; the sum of \u00a75,000 furnished to purchase said cattle, with 8 per cent, interest thereon, for the time the same is used by said parties and in said stock. And the sum of seven hundred and fifty dollars and ten cents, with 8 per cent, interest thereon from March 1, 1885, being a balance due said Montgomery on a previous deal, provided the said stock bring so much. It is distinctly agreed between said parties, that the stock so furnished shall be the sole and absolute property of said Montgomery, and the said stock on said pasture shall be in his possession and in his control, said second parties having put no money in the same, all the purchase money having been furnished by said Montgomery. And it is distinctly agreed, that if said cattle put upon said pasture do not bring the sum of five thousand dollars with 8 per cent, per annum, from the time said money is invested till said cattle is sold, or until December 1, 1885; also, the sum of twelve hundred dollars for said pasture to be paid December 1, 1885, that then the said parties of the second part are to be liable personally for such deficit to said Montgomery, as the cattle are to be purchased and selected by them, and the said Montgomery does not agree to be bound by the valuation placed by them upon said cattle; and all surplus, after making the payments herein above set forth, is to be the property of said second parties.

On the 7tli of October, 1885, Milligan &amp; McIlvane wanted to take 125 head of these cattle out of the pasture and stall-feed them, and the following additional contract was written upon the one made in April, viz.:</p> <blockquote id=\"b31-3\" pgmap=\"31\">\u201c Springfield, Ill., Oct. 7, 1885.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b31-4\" pgmap=\"31\">\u201c It is this day mutually agreed between the parties to this contract, that Milligan &amp; Mcllvane are to remove one hundred and twenty-five (125) head of cattle to their former farm, situated in May Township, in Christian County, Illinois, where they are to feed them corn in the best manner, to cause them to fatten, for sixty (60) days, the feeding to be done under Montgomery\u2019s direction, and this move is in no way to interfere with Montgomery\u2019s ownership and control of the cattle, as per tenor of this contract, of which this agreement becomes part.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b31-5\" pgmap=\"31\">\u201cL. E. Montgomery,</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b31-6\" pgmap=\"31\">\u201c Milligan &amp; MoIlvane.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b31-7\" pgmap=\"31\">The 125 head were accordingly removed.</p> <p id=\"b31-8\" pgmap=\"31\">About the 10th of November, 1885, Milligan &amp; Mcllvane transferred 131 bead of the cattle received under the Brush &amp; McGuire contract from the Tanner farm to the Montgomery pasture, and it is the character of this transfer which forms the issue in dispute: appellant Montgomery insisting that the 131 head of cattle were thus placed in his pasture by Milligan &amp; Mcllvane under their contract with him, and that thereby the title to them at once vested in him; while the latter, as well as appellees, contend that these cattle were removed from the Tanner farm to the Montgomery farm only for the purpose of utilizing the grass on the latter place, and with no intention whatever of making any change in the ownership or possession of the cattle.</p> <p id=\"b31-9\" pgmap=\"31\">We have examined the evidence upon this point carefully, and find it, as usual in such cases, conflicting, but we are not prepared to say that the finding of the jury, that there was no sale or transfer of title, is unwarranted.</p> <p id=\"b31-10\" pgmap=\"31\">Much would depend upon the weight given the various witnesses as to where the preponderance upon this question rests, and the jury having the advantage of seeing and hearing the witnesses, and observing their demeanor upon the stand, their verdict, when properly instructed as to the law of the case, must be regarded as settling the controverted facts.</p> <p id=\"b31-11\" pgmap=\"31(10) 32(34)\">Appellant, under this claim, some time in January, after the insolvency of Milligan &amp; Mcllvane, replevied from their possession 127 head of these cattle, sold them, and refusing, upon demand made upon him by appellees, to account for their value, this suit was instituted.</p> <p id=\"b32-5\" pgmap=\"32\">While appellant was upon the stand as a witness, he was asked the following question: \u201c Have you heard either 'of them (Milligan or Mcllvane) say how they came to put the 131 head in there\u2014what they put them in under? If you heard either of them say, state.\u201d An objection was made, which was sustained by the court, and this ruling of the court is assigned for error.</p> <p id=\"b32-7\" pgmap=\"32\">Milligan &amp; Mcllvane not being parties to the record, their statements in reference to the 'matter inquired about would not be proper unless made at the time, and as a part of the transaction, so as to make them a part of the res gestes.</p> <p id=\"b32-8\" pgmap=\"32\">The question was not so limited as to make it apply to the time of the transaction, and was therefore improper.</p> <p id=\"b32-9\" pgmap=\"32\">Appellant also contends that, at the time of the commencement of this suit, appellee had, as against appellant, neither a right of property nor a right of possession as to the cattle.</p> <p id=\"b32-10\" pgmap=\"32\">The jury having found that there was no sale to appellant he had no interest in the property, and the character of* the contract of June 16tli need not be considered in its relations to third parties.</p> <p id=\"b32-11\" pgmap=\"32\">The firm of Milligan &amp; Mcllvane became insolvent on the 4th of January, 1886, and thereby, as we think, were \u201c prevented by disability from carrying on this business,\u201d which event would, according to the contract, authorize appellees to take immediate possession of the cattle and dispose of them in accordance with its terms, which we think fully answers the objection as to their right to bring the suit.</p> <p id=\"b32-12\" pgmap=\"32\">The action of the Circuit Court in refusing appellant\u2019s refused instructions Hos. 1 and 2, was proper. The judgment of the Circuit Court will be affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b32-13\" pgmap=\"32\">Judgment affirmed,.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
