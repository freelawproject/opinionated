In that year he brought suit for the dissolution of the marriage relation upon the sole ground of the wife\u2019s wilful absence for more than three years. She was personally served in Hamilton county, but did not answer. Upon the hearing the court found that the allegations of the petition were true, and it decreed the dissolution of the marriage relation and awarded to the husband the custody of the children, but providing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>that the mother should be permitted to visit them at all reasonable times. The decree contained the following provision for the wife: \u201cIt is further ordered by the court, the plaintiff having expressed a willingness and desire to make suitable provision for the defendant, that the plaintiff shall pay unto the defendant $1,200 per annum in twelve equal monthly installments in advance beginning January 1, 1882, and continuing so long as the defendant shall live and shall remain unmarried, but said payments shall cease upon her death or remarriage.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b579-7\">At the time of the trial of the suit for divorce the husband was the president of the Volksblatt Co., whose capital stock was $130,000 of which he owned $50,000, par value, while its actual value was much greater. This stock was the substance of his estate. From that time until his death he continued to be the president of the company and the present defendant was its manager. From the death of Mr. Hassaurek until now the defendant has been both president and manager. The monthly installments provided in the decree were paid by Mr. Hassaurek in accordance with its terms until his death, which occurred in France in October, 1885. Upon his death the defendant was appointed special administrator; he acted in that capacity and paid to the plaintiff the monthly installments according to the terms of the decree until June 21, 1886, when, the will of Mr. Hassaurek having been admitted to probate, Eunice Hassaurek, with whom he had in the meantime intermarried, was appointed its executrix; and, until her death in May, 1891, she continued to pay to the plaintiff the monthly installments according to the terms of the decree. Upon her death the present defendant was appointed administrator <em>de bonis non </em>with the will annexed; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>He continued the payment of the monthly installments according to the terms of the decree until July 1, 1899, when he refused to make further payments. From the date of the decree in 1881 until June 1, 1899, the payments were made in dividend checks of the Volksblatt Co., the amounts being charged successively against Mr. Hassaurek as administrator and his children, and this was done with the acquiescence of all against whom the charges were made. The defendant\u2019s refusal to make further payments in 1899 was in compliance with a demand from the executors of the son of the plaintiff, who had died shortly before. When the defendant came into possession of the papers of Mr. Hassaurek he found among them a copy of the decree upon which the plaintiff\u2019s suit is founded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b580-5\">In 1891 the defendant filed in the probate court an account of his administration taking credit, among other things, for the amount of nine monthly payments made to the plaintiff just before the filing of the account, and filing with his account receipts from the son and daughter of the plaintiff, each for fifty shares of the stock of the Volksblatt Co. Until after the refusal to make further payments in 1899 the plaintiff did not file with the administrator a claim for money due under the decree, nor did she ever have notice of any intended or actual distribution of the estate of Mr. Hassaurek. She has remained unmarried from the date of the decree.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b580-6\">The jury were directed to return a verdict for the plaintiff and a judgment followed it. The circuit court reversed the judgment and rendered judgment for the administrator for the reason, as shown by its journal that: \u201cThe said court erred in instructing the jury to bring in a verdict for the plaintiff-below <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>and in .refusing to instruct the jury to bring in a verdict for the defendant below, for the reason that the court of common pleas had no jurisdiction to render the judgment sued on in so far as it required the payment of annual installments as alimony beyond the natural life of Frederick Hassaurek without fixing a definite sum from which the installments were to be paid.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b581-6\"><em>Mr. Judson Harmon; Mr. Alfred C. Cassatt; Messrs. Ernst, Cassatt &amp; McDougall </em>and <em>Messrs. Harmon, Colston, Goldsmith &amp; Hoadly, </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b581-7\">As the wife was defendant in this divorce case and judgment was rendered for her aggression, the rights of the wife were regulated by Section 5700, Revised Statutes. (See the Statutes, 1880.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b581-8\">It will be observed that the statute does not contain the word \u201calimony,\u201d nor does the judgment sued on. The statute authorized the court to adjudge to the defendant such share of the husband\u2019s real or personal property, or both, as it should deem just and reasonable, and this the court did. . If it had jurisdiction to adjudge a sum of money in gross, and this is not denied, it certainly had the <em>power </em>to adjudge the payment of installments which it should find' to be equivalent to such gross sum, and even if it would be erroneous it would not be void.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b581-9\">It is claimed that this judgment is not merely erroneous, but is void, because the court had no power to adjudge to the defendant the payment of installments during her life, and after the death of the plaintiff. In support of this contention, the claim is made that alimony cannot be made payable after the death of the person charged, and that therefore the court had no jurisdiction to enter this judgment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b582-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>But, even assuming that the judgment were here on error, and that any rules applicable to alimony could be applied to it, all of which we deny, nevertheless, we claim that the judgment rendered is a proper one. The overwhelming weight of authority is to the effect that alimony may be made payable during the life of the wife. <em>Stratton </em>v. <em>Stratton, </em>77 Me., 373; <em>Knapp </em>v. <em>Knapp, </em>134 Mass., 353; <em>Storey </em>v. <em>Storey, </em>125 Ill., 608; <em>Burr </em>v. <em>Burr, </em>10 Paige, 20; <em>O\u2019Hagan </em>v. <em>O\u2019Hagan, </em>4 Ia., 509; <em>Carson </em>v. <em>Murray, </em>3 Paige, 483; <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>64 Me., 484.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b582-4\">There are a number of cases which hold:</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b582-5\">1. That where the decree does not specifically order the payment of alimony during the life of the wife, it shall terminate upon the death of the husband ; and</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b582-6\">2. That, in a divorce <em>a mensa et thoro, </em>in which the marriage is not annulled and where the alimony is simply equivalent to the support which the husband owes to the wife, the alimony should not be made payable beyond the life of the husband, because the support for which it is a substitute would not have so continued, and because on the death of the husband, the wife is still entitled to her distributive share of his property.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b582-7\">- 3. But where the divorce is <em>a vinculo </em>the marriage relation is annulled and terminated and the relative property rights of the wife and husband are forever settled; the amount adjudged the wife is not merely in lieu of support; and she is not entitled on the death of the divorced husband to share in his property. Therefore the court in such cases may make the alimony payable during the entire life of the wife.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b582-8\">The record clearly shows that the decree, as to provision for the wife, was entered by consent of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>plaintiff. Of course any judge or lawyer who reads the decree itself, and who knows the manner in which such cases are tried, would be absolutely certain that the decree as to alimony was by consent, and he would not doubt that the amount and the terms and manner of payment were all of them first agreed on by the parties.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b583-4\">Not only is this true, but the substantial legal evidence set forth above proves that the decree in this regard was agreed to by the parties; and as the wife was clearly entitled under the statute to have the court adjudge to her a just and reasonable share of her husband\u2019s real or personal property, any agreement entered into between the husband and wife was an agreement upon a good and valid consideration.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b583-5\">1. The decree recites that both parties were in court hy their counsel, and it does not appear that any objection was made by the plaintiff to this particular provision, which establishes acquiescence on his part.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b583-6\">2. The defendant and his estate paid the sum so provided for a period of seventeen years, which is the strongest possible evidence of consent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b583-7\">There is not a scintilla of testimony to contradict this evidence of the consent of Frederick Hassaurek, and we submit that the court was right in finding such consent as matter of law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b583-8\">Where there is consent, the authorities are clear that the parties charged under the judgment cannot thereafter set up error in the judgment. In <em>Stratton </em>v. <em>Stratton, supra, </em>this question arose:</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AOj\">The statute of Maine provided that alimony could not be allowed to the wife on the libel of the husband, and the court undoubtedly had no right to grant alimony to the wife on the libel of the husband, but in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>the judgment under consideration in <em>Stratton </em>v. <em>Stratton, </em>77 Me., 373, this had been done. <em>Fletcher </em>v. <em>Holmes, </em>25 Ind., 458; <em>Crews </em>v. <em>Mooney, </em>74 Mo., 26; <em>Julier </em>v. <em>Julier, </em>62 Ohio St., 90; <em>Buck </em>v. <em>Buck, </em>60 Ill., 241; <em>Storey </em>v. <em>Storey, </em>125 Ill., 608. This matter has been passed on by this court. <em>Law </em>v. <em>Law, </em>64 Ohio St., 369.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b584-4\">We submit that this is not a matter pertaining to the jurisdiction of the court, but that it relates simply to the question of whether or not the court committed error. That question cannot be raised in the present action, no exception haying been taken, no error proceedings having been prosecuted, and the judgment having been complied with for so many years. It is not necessary to cite authoriti\u00e9s to this court on the proposition that where the court had jurisdiction of the subject matter and of the parties, a judgment rendered by it can not be collaterally attacked, even though it might be erroneous. That has been held on numerous occasions by this court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b584-5\">We do not know of a case decided by this court in which the question has arisen as to the validity of a judgment granting relief which was greater, or different from the relief allowed by the statute, but other courts have passed upon it. <em>Johnson et al. </em>v. <em>Mining Co. et al., </em>78 Wis., 159. This judgment was regularly paid by Frederick Hassaurek and his estate for seventeen years pursuant to its terms. As soon as the estate ceased paying the amount, the defendant in error filed her claim with the administrator, according to law, and upon its rejection entered suit upon her claim.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b584-6\">We submit that this is a clear compliance with the law, and that any cases which relate to the method of collecting alimony are not applicable hereto, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>this is, by the terms of the statute, and by its own terms, a judgment for money.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ab7\">The alleged final account of Colonel Markbreit as administrator did not close the estate as to Mrs. Hassaurek or release it from liability to her. The estate was still indebted to Mrs. Hassaurek under the terms of the judgment sued upon. The administrator had due notice of the claim and had recognized and paid the same is it fell due for. many years. He had certified a copy of the judgment which came to him with Mr. Hassaurek\u2019s papers. No matter what sort of an account may be filed, an estate is not settled as long as there are assets to distribute and debts to pay. <em>Weyer </em>v. <em>Watt, </em>48 Ohio St., 545. The estate distributed to the heirs was more than sufficient to pay this debt after paying all other debts, so it was the duty of the administrator to protect himself against his claim, or have it provided for under Section 6115, Revised Statutes. She had no notice or knowledge of the filing of the account. <em>Law </em>v. <em>Law, </em>64 Ohio St., 369; <em>Petersine </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>28 Ohio St., 596; <em>Olney </em>v. <em>Watts, </em>43 Ohio St., 499; <em>Maxwell </em>v. <em>Sawyer, </em>90 Wis., 352; <em>Wickes </em>v. <em>Wickes, </em>98 Ill.

Therefore, in entering this decree, the court has only such powers as are given it by the statute, and can exercise none other. <em>Olin </em>v. <em>Hungerford, </em>10 Ohio, 268.

The power is a statutory power incident to the jurisdiction over applications for divorce.

Enc. Law (2 ed.), 118; Stewart on Marriage and Divorce, Sec. 371; Nelson <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>on Marriage and Separation, Sec. 907; <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>33 W. Va., 695.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b588-4\">As the plaintiff in error, who was an erring wife, had no rights at common law, her entire rights must be determined from the statutes. The statute upon this subject, which was in force at the time this decree was granted, was originally passed as one section and is found at 51 O. L., p. 377, Sec. 7. It was carried into the revision of the statutes of 1880 under the sectional number of 5699 and 5700.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b588-5\">It will be noticed from an examination of this statute, that where the husband is the aggressor, the wife may be allowed \u201calimony,\u201d and it may be in installments, but where the wife is the aggressor, she shall be adjudged a \u201cshare\u201d of her husband\u2019s property. This law was passed as one section. It becomes evident, therefore, that the legislature intended to make a distinction between the cases where the wife was the aggressor and the husband was the aggressor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A1p\">The common pleas court in entering this decree in 1881, may have thought that the legislature <em>ought, </em>in such a case, to have allowed alimony in installments,or it may even have thought that the legislature <em>intended </em>to allow alimony in installments in such a case, but failed to do so by mistake, but this will not authorize the court to read that provision into the statute. It is a well recognized principle of law that the law is as it is written, and the court, under the guise of interpretation, has no right to inject into the law things which are not there. 23 Am. &amp; Eng.

The decree in the case at bar was not founded on an agreement between the parties.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b592-7\">Opposing counsel contend, first, that independent of any contract between Frederick and Eliza Hassaurek, the plaintiff in error was entitled to collect the installments falling due after the death of Frederick Hassaurek. The foregoing authorities show that this claim is not well founded. In the second place, opposing counsel contend that the decree was founded upon a contract between the parties and that for this reason the installments may be collected after the death of the husband. We deny that there was any such contract.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b592-8\">We start with the presumption that a decree is founded on evidence and not on agreement. This is a presumption of ordinary experience for they are ordinarily so founded, and it has been recognized by an Ohio court. <em>Sargent </em>v. <em>Sargent, </em>11 Dec., 218; 7 N.

Even when a decree for alimony in installments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>is founded on a contract, that contract must specifically bind the heirs of the husband to justify the payment of installments after the death of the husband. <em>Storey </em>v. <em>Storey, </em>125 Ill., 608.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b593-6\">4. Not only must the contract specifically bind the heirs, but the divorced wife must have, by la\\V and independent of the contract, the right to dower in the husband\u2019s estate or the installments must cease at the death of the husband. <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Storey, </em>135 Ill., 448.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b593-7\">5. There are good reasons for holding that the installments must cease at the husband\u2019s death. <em>Lockwood </em>v. <em>Krum, </em>34 Ohio St., 1; <em>Field </em>v. <em>Field, </em>66 How.

It does not create a debt and is not a- judgment, and therefore a suit cannot be maintained for the arrears due under it. We base this statement upon the following considerations:</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b593-9\">First \u2014 There is no provision in our statutes authorizing a suit to be brought upon such a decree.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b593-10\">Second \u2014 There was no provision at common law for bringing suit upon a decree for alimony in installments. The only way to enforce such a decree at common law was in earlier times by excommunication and afterwards by imprisonment. See 2 Bishop on Mar. &amp; Div. (6 ed.), Sec. 497; Stewart on Mar. &amp; Div., Sec. 362.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b593-11\">The reason for thus holding becomes plain when we examine the common law actions. These were real, personal, and mixed, o Stephens on. Pleading, p. 39. The real and mixed actions were writ of right, formed on, dower and <em>quare impedit. </em>Ib., 43. The personal actions were debt, covenant, detinue, tres<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>pass, trespass on the case and replevin. Ib., 46. It requires but a glance at the above list to see that this decree does not come within any of the above actions unless it comes within trespass on the case or debt. The writ of trespass on the case lies where a party sues for <em>damages </em>for any wrong or cause of complaint to which covenant or trespass do not apply. Stephens on Plead., 48. It becomes evident from this definition that the action brought by Eliza Hassaurek is not an action of trespass on the case. She does not ask for <em>damages </em>of any sort, but for money due under an order of court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b594-5\">This then must be an action in debt, or else it is not an action known to the common law. \u201cThe writ of debt lies when a party claims the recovery of a debt.7\u2019 Stephens on Pleading, 46. Unless the claim rising under this decree is a debt or a judgment (which is a debt of record), it cannot be the basis of an action in debt.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b594-6\">A decree for alimony in installments does not create a debt, for such alimony may be enforced by imprisonment notwithstanding the constitutional inhibtion against imprisonment for debt. <em>Effinger </em>v. <em>State of Ohio, </em>5 Circ.

That an order to pay alimony in installments is not a judgment is specifically held in <em>Hart </em>v. <em>Hart, </em>1 Dec., 94; 1 N. P., 56; <em>Myers </em>v. <em>Myers, </em>4 Dec., 217; 3 N. P., 162. It is inferentially held in <em>Olin </em>v. <em>Hungerford, </em>10 Ohio, 368, where it is held that alimony in installments is not a lien upon real estate, and in <em>Everick </em>v. <em>Conrad, 2 </em>Circ. Dec., 517; 4 C. C. R., 234, where the court holds that alimony in installments and alimony in gross differ from each other.

C., 70.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b595-7\">Such a decree as this can be enforced by contempt proceedings.

This conclusion is strengthened by the following decisions upon analagous questions.</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b595-9\">While a d\u00e9cree for alimony is not a decree in chancery, as was decided in <em>Olin </em>v. <em>Hungerford, </em>10 Ohio, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>268, it resembles to a chancery decree for the payment of money. <em>Van Buskirk </em>v. <em>Mulock, </em>18 N. <em>J. </em>Law,. 184; 2 Bishop on Mar. &amp; Div., Sec. 499.</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b596-4\">It has been held that a suit cannot be maintained on an action for alimony <em>pendente lite because it is subject to revision or modification at any time. Vine </em>v. <em>Vine, </em>42 Atl. Rep., 871 (21 R. I., 190) ; <em>Nary </em>v. <em>Braley, Admr., </em>41 Vt., 181; 2 Am. &amp; Eng. Enc.

This is true first, because it is always liable to be modified by the court. <em>Olney </em>v. <em>Watts, </em>43 Ohio St., 499; <em>King </em>v. <em>King, </em>38 Ohio St., 370; <em>Hare </em>v. <em>Gibson, </em>32 Ohio St., 33; <em>Kempster </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>15 L.

Law (2 ed.), 270.</p>\n<p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b596-7\">Alimony decreed in installments to the wife for life ceases at the death of the husband, when the divorce is granted to the husband for the aggression of the wife.</p>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b596-8\">\n<em>Construing the statute in the light of the law of alimony, the court exceeded its jurisdiction.</em>\n</p>\n<p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b596-9\">The law of alimony is based on the duty of the husband to support the wife. This duty arises on marriage, and when the marriage relation is terminated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>by the death of the husband, this duty naturally and of itself ceases. When the divorce is granted for the aggression of the husband, this same duty is enforced by the court, and is known in the law as alimony. The decree for alimony takes the usual form of installments of money payable at regular intervals by the husband, as presented in the alimony decree at bar.</p>\n<p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b597-6\">The support that a wife receives after a husband\u2019s death is created by statute, and is an interest in the husband\u2019s property, known as her dower in his real and personal estate. Therefore during a husband\u2019s life a wife has her right of support; after his death her other rights in his property accrue \u2014 in our state fixed expressly by the statutes. <em>Lockwood </em>v. <em>Krum, </em>34 Ohio St., 1; <em>Conger et al. </em>v. <em>Barker\u2019s Admr. and Heirs, </em>11 Ohio St., 1; 2 Am. &amp; Eng.

Pomeroy\u2019s Eq. Jur. (2 ed.), Sec. 1120; <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>37 Wis., 206.</p>\n<p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b597-8\">The statute in force at the time is found in 51 O. L., 377, Sec. 7 (sections 5699 and 5700, inclusive of the statutes of 1880).</p>\n<p data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b597-9\">This precise question has been decided by the Supreme Court of Kansas in <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>57 Kan., 343, involving a statute similar to ours and a decree for alimony like the present.</p>\n<p data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b597-10\">So the court in this case had the power to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>grant a certain portion of the husband\u2019s real or personal property at the time of the divorce; could have granted a sum in gross as alimony, which might also be made payable in installments, but would still be a part of that gross sum. This is exemplified in the statute itself, for if a divorce be granted for the husband\u2019s aggression the wife is entitled to a \u201csum of money, payable either in gross or in installments.\u201d It follows that the section cannot be extended from its apparent intention in favor of the erring wife.</p>\n<p data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b598-4\">Therefore we claim, as our first ground, that the court had no jurisdiction to grant the decree as entered.</p>\n<p data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b598-5\">The distinction between a division of property and an alimony decree in installments is now well settled by the authorities. <em>Bacon </em>v. <em>Bacon, </em>43 Wis., 197; <em>Maxwell </em>v. <em>Sawyer, </em>90 Wis., 352; <em>White </em>v. <em>Bates, </em>89 Tenn., 570; <em>Olney </em>v. <em>Watts, </em>43 Ohio St., 499.</p>\n<p data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b598-6\">Moreover the duration of the payments is indefinite, for it may be terminated at any time by the remarriage of the plaintiff in error, and for that reason can not be considered a final division of the husband\u2019s property. This is shown in the case of <em>Kempster </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>81 Wis., 247 (15 L. R. A., 391).</p>\n<p data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b598-7\">Another reason that this judgment is not a division of the husband\u2019s property at the time of divorce, is that a decree of this nature for the aggression of the wife is subject to modification. <em>Olney </em>v. <em>Watts, </em>43 Ohio St., 499; <em>Pretzinger </em>v. <em>Pretzinger, </em>45 Ohio St., 452.</p>\n<p data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b598-8\">The wife for whose aggression a divorce is secured is not entitled to any alimony unless expressly allowed to her by statute. 2 Am. &amp; Eng.

That court has the power to grant a share of the husband\u2019s property <em>(Dinet </em>v. <em>Eigenmann, </em>80 Ill., 274), but if the alimony is decreed in installments, it is not a division of the husband\u2019s property, and a court has no jurisdiction, though the divorce be granted for the husband\u2019s aggression, to decree the installments beyond the husband\u2019s life,, unless the alimony be in lieu of dower. <em>Lennahan </em>v. <em>O\u2019Keefe, </em>107 Ill., 620; <em>Stahl </em>v. <em>Stahl, </em>114 Ill., 375; <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Storey, </em>135 Ill., 448 (11 L.

In <em>Field </em>v. <em>Field, </em>15 Abb., N. Cas., 434, suit was brought for unpaid installments of alimony that had accrued since the husband\u2019s death. The decree for divorce had been granted to the wife for the husband\u2019s aggression and alimony ordered to continue in express terms during the life of the wife. The case is affirmed in <em>Johns </em>v. <em>Johns, </em>44 App. Div., 533, in which the court holds that if alimony be also given in lieu of dower which is secured to her by the New York statutes, the court would then have jurisdiction to continue the installment beyond the husband\u2019s life.

This doctrine is recognized by the Supreme Court of the United States in the case of <em>Windsor </em>v. <em>McVeigh, </em>93 U. S., 274; <em>Cooper </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>77 U. S. (10 Wall), 308. We claim that this question has been decided by this court in <em>Rosebrough </em>v. <em>Ansley, </em>35 Ohio St., 107. Then <em>Spoors </em>v. <em>Coen, </em>44 Ohio St., 497, holds that where no claim is stated, and the court renders judgment, that it is such a judgment as may be collaterally attacked. <em>McCleary </em>v. <em>McLain, 2 </em>Ohio St., 369.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"99\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b602-5\">Shauck, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aa1\">There was, upon the evidence, no question of fact for the consideration of the jury. The general question is whether, upon the conceded facts, the judgment should be for the plaintiff, as was held in the court of common pleas, or for the defendant, as was held in the circuit court. The decree of divorce upon which the plaintiff\u2019s action is founded is easily recognized as the termination of marital relations between a pair with whom respect had survived devotedness. Its terms show that the natural relations between the mother and her children were to continue so far as was compatible with a severance of the relations between the parents; that although the evidence established the allegations of the wife\u2019s willful absence the husband desired to secure to her during her life such support as was consistent with his means; that it was by his request that his desire found expression in the terms of the decree, and that the obligation which it imposed was to continue during her life without regard to the duration of his own, if the wife should not by remarriage acquire other means of support. The binding character of this obligation was recognized throughout eighteen years by all the members of the family of the parties. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>is now disputed by strangers. Certainly an arrangement so consonant with natural justice should be enforced unless it is forbidden by some inflexible rule of the law so beneficent in its general operation that it should be maintained notwithstanding hardships which may result from its application to particular cases. Such a rule was thought to be applied to the case in the circuit court when it reversed the judgment of the court of common pleas because that court \u201chad no jurisdiction to render the judgment sued on in so far as it required the payment of annual installments as alimony beyond the natural life of Frederick Hassaurek without fixing a definite sum from which the installments were .to be paid.\u201d To support this conclusion much is urged and many cases are cited in the elaborate briefs of counsel for the defendant. That inquiry may be effective, attention should be given to the precise nature of the case. There is no direct attack upon the decree of 1881 by a proceeding to reverse it as erroneous. It is attacked collaterally as void. There is no occasion for considering what presumption should be indulged when the decree in a case of this character is silent with respect to the time during which payments are to be made, \u00bfunce it is here provided expressly that they should continue during the life of the wife, she remaining unmarried. Nor need we consider the nature of the obligations upon which decrees for alimony are founded since the finding of the court upon the evidence that the wife had been willfully absent for more than three years, and its judgment that the marriage relation should be terminated for that -reason, excluded her right to alimony. The court having concluded that a divorce should be decreed for her aggression, its further jurisdiction was defined by Sec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>tion 5700 of the Revised Statutes, as follows: \u201cAnd the court may adjudge to her such share of the husband\u2019s real or personal property, or both, as it deems just and reasonable.\u201d In view of the wide discretion vested in the court in making that adjudication it cannot be said that its power to adjudge is limited to the allegations of the pleadings as in <em>Rosebrough </em>v. <em>Ansley, </em>35 Ohio St., 107. The court having this duty to perform and having the parties and their counsel before it, with their consent and at the request of the husband adjudged to the wife during life the equivalent of less than one-third of the dividends of the stock owned by the husband. Whether this judgment would have been an erroneous exercise of the jurisdiction which the statute vested in the court if it had been rendered without consent we need not consider. It must now be regarded as settled beyond controversy that when, in an action for divorce, the court is satisfied from the evidence that the marriage relations should be annulled the parties are competent to contract with respect to such changes in property rights as are to result from the severance of the former relation and their contract, if approved by the court, may be carried into its decree, thus becoming a perpetual obligation. <em>Petersine </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>28 Ohio St., 596; <em>Julier </em>v. <em>Julier, </em>62 Ohio St., 90; <em>Law </em>v. <em>Law, </em>64 Ohio St., 369. Whether the request of the husband that the decree should be in the terms employed was prompted by a desire to advance his own interests by retaining personal control of the stock which would otherwise have been adjudged to the wife, of by the conviction that in this mode her future support would be more secure, cannot be material to the validity of the obligation. The judgment of the circuit court cannot stand upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>ground npon which, it was placed. The plaintiff\u2019s demand having been made upon the executor upon his appointment as special administrator and having been complied with because of his knowledge of its existence and justice, there is no basis for the contention that there should have been a further presentation of the claim. Nor could the administrator with knowledge of the existence of this demand against the estate defeat it by a distribution of the estate in his hands. Indeed, the conduct, of the parties for eight years thereafter shows that what is spoken of as the distribution of 1891 was regarded by the parties as \u2022subject to the demand of the plaintiff to be discharged by the administrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\"><em>Judgment of the circuit court reversed and that of </em>\u25a0 <em>the common pleas affirmed.</em></p>\n<judges id=\"AYL\">Burket, C.
