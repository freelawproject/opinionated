Wilt as principal, and the plaintiff in error as his surety on the administrator\u2019s bond. The record shows that in attempt<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>ing to make out their defense to the action brought by Rhodes, the defendants propounded to the administrator, Wilt, certain questions to elicit from the witness, what if any consideration was paid to any one to induce the withdrawal of the exceptions which had been filed to his account as to expenses- of administration. The court permitted inquiries as to any amount which had been paid' to plaintiff Rhodes, but refused to admit testimony as to what, if anything, had been paid to the excepting creditor, or any one else. When the court sustained objections to such inquiries, no statement was made of what the expected proof would be, and as it occurred during the examination in chief, the ruling of the court is not reviewable in the absence of such statement. The rule requires a profert of the desired evidence, in order that a reviewing court can determine whether or not the action of the trial court was prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">However, if we may glean from the current of the examination what counsel for defendants desired, it would appear that such inquiries were properly shut out. The judgment and orders of the probate court, could not be thus impeached.\" In that court, the party excepting to the administrator\u2019s account, had a right to withdraw the exceptions at any time before final submission, and that was done, and at a later date, the account was approved and settled. The administrator was well aware of what had been done, and \u25a0it would seem that such withdrawal was entirely satisfactory to him, as it was his account that had been assailed. Several months intervened between the withdrawal of the exceptions and the final order. No other objections were made. The surety on the bond was not a party to that proceeding, and he had no right to be. He undertook to secure the perform<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>anee of duties and obligations imposed on the administrator, and after the probate court had settled the account, to which no objection existed, we think, the surety, when sued upon the bond, cannot inquire into the motives or consideration which led to the withdrawal of objections to the account.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">These remarks dispose of the other complaint, that the defendants were not allowed to amend their answers. Counsel informed the trial court that they desired to so amend the answers as to make the excluded evidence competent; but no amended answer was tendered to the court to act upon, for we find none in the record. Stating what was desired as an amendment was not sufficient. However, if an amendment had been tendered, containing the averments orally disclosed to the court, it would have been irrelevant, and the tender of an immaterial issue as already stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">It is also claimed, that the plaintiff in error is not liable as surety on the bond of the administrator, for the services rendered by Rhodes as attorney of such administrator, because they are not a debt against the estate, hut against the administrator personally. Counsel for plaintiff in error, state their position as follows: \u201cCan the surety on an administrator\u2019s bond be held liable to the attorney of the administrator for services performed for the administrator as such, or is the failure of the administrator to pay his attorney fee, a breach of the conditions of the bond? We think not.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">To support their decision' on the question as they put it, they cite <em>Thomas, Admx., </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>52 Ohio St., 200. That was an action brought before a magistrate by Moore, as the surviving partner of the firm of McKnight &amp; Moore, against Elizabeth J. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>Thomas, as administratrix, to recover for legal services rendered her by that firm. The bill of particulars stated the services were performed at her request-in various suits' brought by find against h\u00e9r as such administratrix. . '</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">Judgment was obtained in the justice\u2019s court for the amount sued for, and the defendant gave notice of appeal, and filed a duly certified transcript, but gave no appeal bond. In the court of common pleas the appeal was dismissed for want of an appeal bond, the court holding the appeal was not in the interest of the trust she represented. This court, in reviewing and affirming the. order of dismissal, laid down this rule: \u201cExecutors and administrators are personally liable for the services of attorneys employed by them, but their contracts therefor do not bind the estate, although the services are rendered for the benefit of the estate, and are such as the executor or administrator may properly pay for, and receive credit for the expenditure in the settlement of his accounts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A5P8\">That case is used to show, that the administrator or executor may not be allowed' in his settlement the full amount he has actually paid his attorneys, but only such amount, as he shows was reasonable compensation for the services rendered. We think that case was correctly decided; but how does it relieve the surety in this case? It is true that Wilt, the administrator, had paid but a small part of the attorney\u2019s fees, but, as shown in the statement of this case, he was required by the probate court to file an account of the expenses of administration preparatory to the filing of his final account. This was done, and due notice by publication was given of the filing and pendency of the expense account, which was heard on a day to which its hearing had been ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>journed. The itemized hill of Mr. Rhodes for attorney fees was before that court, and we must assume that sufficient legal proof of the nature and value of the services rendered was made. The court approved the account as to the expenses of the administrator and his attorney as separately stated. Then came the final account and order of distribution, wherein the administrator was ordered to pay out of the assets in his hands, the amount found due the attorney, and from the balance to pay his own expenses as allowed. The administrator paid Rhodes $50 and no more, and on refusal to pay as ordered by the probate court, the action was brought on his bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">The probate court examined and approved the expense account in advance of its payment. That court had all the light on the facts, that could have been shed, on an examination of a claim for reimbursement, had the administrator paid the attorney in advance, and taken credit for the same in his account. In this instance the attorney fees were examined and. approved in advance of payment, and on final account, ordered paid from the assets of the estate. The subject had been fully adjudicated and ended. We think the probate court had authority to do this. Section 6188 of Revised Statutes, after fixing the ordinary compensation for executors and administra tors, provides that \u201cin all cases such further allowance shall be made as the court shall consider just and reasonable for actual and necessary expenses, and for any extraordinary services, not required of an executor or administrator, in the common course of his duty * *</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">Section 6090 provides as to the order of paying debts that, \u201cFirst, the funeral expenses, those of last, sickness, and the expenses of administration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>Section 524 gives the probate court exclusive jurisdiction \u201cto direct and control the conduct and to settle the accounts of executors and administrators, and to order the distribution of estates.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">The administrator, Wilt, was ordered to make distribution, a part of which order was that he pay to Rhodes, the attorney, the sum of $527.25 before that time found by the court to be due him. This was an order which the court had power and was authorized to make, and it was binding upon the administrator and his sureties. A failure to comply with it was a breach of his bond for which the sureties are liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">The bond involved, provides, among other things, that the administrator \u201cshall pay any balance remaining in his hands upon the settlement of his accounts to such person as said court or the law shall direct.\u201d The amount so found in his hands and the order to pay the same, in the absence of fraud and collusion, are conclusive not only upon the administrator but also upon his sureties,'unless reversed on. error or vacated by appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">As supporting our views in this case, see <em>Slagle </em>v. <em>Entrekin, </em>44 Ohio St., 637; <em>Braiden </em>v. <em>Mercer, </em>44 Ohio St., 339; <em>Foster, Admr., </em>v. <em>Wise, Admr., </em>46 Ohio St., 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-9\">The .judgment of the circuit court is free from error, and is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-10\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b533-11\">B\u00fcrket, O.
