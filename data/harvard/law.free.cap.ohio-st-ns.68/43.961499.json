Vernon, Ohio, alleging a state of facts in substance as follows : On the first of March, 1897, one Frank Frorer executed his negotiable promissory note of that date for the sum of $2,056, payable to the order of Mrs. C. A. Rowley and F. S. Rowley, her husband, at the First National Bank of Lincoln, Illinois. The note came into the possession of the Lincoln bank indorsed:' \u201cC. A. Rowley,\u201d \u201cF. S. Rowley,\u201d \u201cJerome Rowley.\u201d \u201cPay First National Bank Lincoln, Illinois, or order.\u201d First National Bank Mt. Vernon, Ohio. Fred E. Sturges, Pres.\u201d The signature of Mrs. C. A. Rowley as an indorser of the note was forged. The Lincoln <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>bank received tbe note in tbe due course of business, and relying upon tbe genuineness of all tbe signatures appearing upon tbe note, presented tbe same to tbe maker for payment and tbe amount of tbe note was paid to it by tbe maker and by it to tbe Mt. Vernon bank.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b68-5\">Mrs. Rowley thereupon brought suit in the circuit court of Logan county, Illinois, against tbe maker of said note to compel him to pay to her one-balf of said note, she alleging that her signature as indorser of tbe note was forged and that she bad never received any part of tbe one-balf of tbe proceeds of said note which belonged to her. She recovered a judgment for tbe amount claimed. Thereupon tbe maker of said note, relying upon tbe warranty of tbe Lincoln bank that Mrs. Rowley\u2019s signature as indorser was genuine, notified it in writing of tbe said forgery and demanded that it repay to him tbe amount of Mrs. Rowley\u2019s judgment. Tbe Lincoln bank thereupon notified tbe Mt. Vernon bank of that demand and notified it further that it would require tbe Mt. Vernon bank to protect tbe plaintiff and make good any sum that it might have to pay tbe maker of said note upon bis said demand. Tbe Mt. Vernon bank refused to pay tbe amount demanded either to tbe plaintiff or to tbe maker of said note and tbe Lincoln bank refused to pay to tbe maker tbe sum demanded by him, and thereupon tbe maker of said note, Frorer, brought suit against tbe Lincoln bank to recover tbe amount which be bad been adjudged to pay to Mrs. Rowley. Tbe Lincoln bank gave notice to tbe Mt. Vernon bank of tbe bringing of said suit, furnishing it a copy of tbe declaration therein and requested it to appear in said suit and make such defense as it might desire in view of its liability to tbe Lincoln bank by rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>son of its warranty that the signatures were genuine; and afterward the Lincoln bank gave to the Mt. Vernon bank timely notice of the day upon which said cause was set for trial, but the Mt. Vernon bank made no defense to said action, nor did it render any assistance in the defense. A judgment against the Lincoln bank was recovered by the maker of the note for the sum of $1,166.81, and costs of suit, and the prayer of the present petition is that the Lincoln bank may recover that amount from the Mt. Vernon bank.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b69-6\">The Mt. Vernon bank answered the petition of the plaintiff, the material portion of its answer being: \u201cThe defendant denies that the indorsement of the name of C. A. Rowley on the back of said note was a forgery; on the contrary it avers that said indorsement was the true and genuine signature of said C. A. Rowley.\u201d To this answer the Lincoln bank demurred. The demurrer' was sustained, and the defendant not desiring to answer over, a judgment was rendered in favor of the Lincoln bank for the amount which it claimed. On a petition in error to the circuit court that judgment was affirmed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b69-7\"><em>Messrs.

Cas. Eq.; <em>Warner </em>v. <em>McGary, </em>4 Vt., 507.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b71-12\">Shauck, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A1\">Counsel for the plaintiff in error urge two propositions, either of which, if sound, would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>require a reversal of the judgment of the circuit court. The first is that the indorsement of the Mt. Vernon bank, though unconditional and unrestricted, did not import a warranty of the genuineness of the signature of the prior indorser, Mrs. Rowley. It is elementary that one who even by mere delivery transfers a note payable to bearer thereby undertakes that all signatures upon the note are genuine and that all whose names appear had legal capacity to enter into the contract indicated. Certainly the legal import of a transfer by indorsement and delivery cannot be less. <em>Dumont </em>v. <em>Williamson, </em>18 Ohio St., 515; <em>Bank </em>v. <em>Bank, </em>58 Ohio St., 207.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">The second proposition of counsel for the plaintiff in error is that it is not precluded by Frorer\u2019s judgment against the Lincoln bank from asserting any defense which might have been originally interposed against the claim founded upon the alleged forgery of Mrs. Rowley\u2019s signature. The pertinency of this proposition is manifest in view of the allegation in the answer that Mrs. Rowley\u2019s signature is genuine. The view urged in support of the judgment of the circuit court is that although the Mt. Vernon bank was not, in fact, a party to the record in which Frorer recovered judgment against the Lincoln bank, nevertheless because of the notice given to it by that bank informing it of the bringing of said suit and requiring it as the party liable over to the defendant therein to appear and interpose such defense as it might have, it is precluded from asserting such defense now. In <em>Commrs. of Brown Co. </em>v. <em>Butt, </em>2 Ohio, 348, it was decided that a sheriff against whom a liability had been adjudged for permitting the escape of a prisoner, might have an action over against the commissioners of the county for failing to provide a jail wherein the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>prisoner could be securely kept, and that in an action brought by him against the commissioners of the county the measure of damages should be the amount of the judgment which had been recovered against him. In a dissenting opinion the correctness of the judgment was denied upon the ground that under the statute then in force the county was not liable over to the sheriff. The case was overruled in the <em>Commrs. </em>v. <em>Mighels, </em>7 Ohio St., 109, upon the ground taken in the dissenting opinion; but the doctrine of the case as to the effect of a former suit in an action against one liable over does not appear to have been questioned. In <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Rhoades, </em>20 Ohio St., 494, an action upon a bond given by a creditor to indemnify an officer for the sale of property held by him upon execution, but claimed by another, a judgment having been recovered against the officer, it was held that \u201cthe creditor having due notice of the action and an opportunity to defend against it, the judgment is conclusive evidence against the obligor of the amount of damages sustained.\u201d We have become familiar with the application of this doctrine to one who is liable over to another on a warranty of title to land, it being accepted as the established law that the warrantee may charge the warrantor with the consequences of an action to evict by giving him timely notice of the suit with an offer of opportunity to defend. It is an extension of the doctrine that all who are parties to a judicial record \u00e1re bound by the judgment, and it rests upon the same foundation; the necessity that there be an end of litigation. It was placed upon that ground in <em>Robbins </em>v. <em>City of Chicago, </em>4 Wall., 657, where it was decided that a municipality which had been adjudged liable to one, injured in consequence of the dangerous condition of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>its street might recover the amount of the judgment from the owner of abutting property by whom the dangerous condition had been created, such owner having had actual, though informal, notice of the pendency of the suit against it. The reason for the doctrine does not suggest that there should be any limit to its application because of the nature of the obligation over of the person notified. Upon examination of numerous decisions in other states and in the Federal courts, it appears that the doctrine is of general application without regard to the nature of the liability over of the person notified, whether it arises out of contract or by operation of law. Many cases illustrative of the varied applications of the doctrine are collected in Black on Judgments, Sec. 574, and Bigelow on Estoppel, page 131. They seem to recognize no exception to the rule that in an action to recover from one liable over on account of a demand upon which there has been a judgment against the plaintiff, the defendant is bound by such judgment if he had due notice of the suit in which it was rendered and an opportunity to defend. Some differences of opinion appear with respect to the character of the notice which should be given to the person liable over, but none of the cases casts any doubt upon the sufficiency of such full notice and opportunity to defend as are set out in the untraversed allegations of the original petition in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b74-6\">Buricet, C.
