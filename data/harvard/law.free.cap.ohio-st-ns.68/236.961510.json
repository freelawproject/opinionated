At the same time through the negligence of the defendant, without any right on its part so to do, without any fault or neglect on the part of the plaintiff, a large quantity of oil was discharged from the cisterns and reservoirs in which the defendant had collected the same, and in addition thereto, a large quantity of sewerage, consisting of vile, noxious, and foul-smelling substances, arising from said hospital and the use of same by defendant, were carried down and collected by it in artificial sewers, and all of said substances were discharged by the defendant into the said \u2018Dry Hollow,\u2019 and together with and by means of said volume of water, were carried down and lodged and discharged upon the lands so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>leased by tbe plaintiff, as aforesaid. As a result, more than six acres of his lands were wholly submerged, and after tbe subsidence of tbe water, tbe foul substances aforesaid were left and deposited thereon in such a way and to such an extent that a large part of bis crops, consisting of potatoes, red beets, turnips, cucumbers, beans, and peas, etc., were utterly and wholly destroyed, and tbe remainder were so soaked and permeated with tbe foul substances aforesaid as to be rendered utterly unfit for market, or for use in any way.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b263-4\">\u201cTbe plaintiff says that the defendant, having undertaken to collect tbe water, oil, and other substances on said ground, was bound to so restrain and control tbe same as not to permit their- escape to the damage of tbe plaintiff. Tbe plaintiff says that be has been damaged, by reason of tbe premises, in tbe sum of three hundred dollars, for which, with interest, be asks judgment.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b263-5\">Defendant answered as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b263-6\">\u201cSaid defendant admits its incorporation, that it owns and controls tbe real estate (over 500 acres) described in plaintiff\u2019s petition, and tbe averments as to tbe number of inmates cared for by defendant. Tbe tanks and artificial bodies of water are located on tbe real estate, as described in plaintiff\u2019s petition; admits tbe ownership of tbe real estate in plaintiff-as set out in plaintiff\u2019s petition; denies each and every other allegation in said petition contained. Wherefore, prays to be dismissed for its costs herein.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b263-7\">Tbe trial in tbe court of common pleas resulted in a verdict for tbe plaintiff. A motion for a new trial was made and overruled and a bill of exceptions taken and judgment on the verdict for plaintiff.

Among the \u2022assignments of error is the following: \u201cSaid circuit court erred in finding that the defendant in error \u2022is part of the government of the United States, and that for this reason there was no liability upon its part to the plaintiff in error.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b264-9\">Messrs. <em>Young &amp; Young, </em>for plaintiff in error.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b264-10\">The home is a corporation, and the statute under which it is organized expressly provides that it shall have power to sue and be sued in courts of law and equity. Soon after its organization, the Supreme Court of Ohio decided that its inmates were exclusively within the jurisdiction of the government of the United States. <em>Sinks </em>v. <em>Reese, </em>19 Ohio St., 306.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b265-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>But, shortly after the decision of this case, by an act of congress, passed January 21, 1871, jurisdiction oyer the home was relinquished by the United States and ceded to the state of Ohio. The effect of this recession coming under consideration in the Supreme Court, in <em>Renner </em>v. <em>Bennett, </em>21 Ohio St., 421.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b265-6\">Eyen before the recession of the jurisdiction to the state, the supreme court of Wisconsin, differently from the Supreme Court of Ohio, held that the home was always subject to the jurisdiction of the state courts. <em>In re O\u2019Connor, </em>37 Wis., 379; 19 Am. Rep., 765.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b265-7\">The home is not a <em>quasi </em>corporation, like boards of county commissioners, township trustees, etc., but it is a <em>corporation </em>which, under the law creating it, is expressly giyen the power to sue and be sued.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b265-8\">The acts complained of in the. petition were a trespass upon plaintiff\u2019s property and distinguished from mere negligence in the performance of a ministerial act.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b265-9\">The circuit court suggests that the remedy of the plaintiff below would be a suit against the officers of the home personally. This might be a very poor remedy. Some of them may be financially responsible, while others may not be.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b265-10\">In the case of a corporation like the home, with capabilities for injuring the persons and property of others by the commission of tortious acts many fold greater than that of other corporations in the state, it would seem to be establishing an exceedingly dangerous doctrine to say, as the circuit court has done in this case, that the home cannot be held liable in the courts for injuries thus inflicted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b265-11\">In support of our contention that the petition does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>state a cause of action for which the home is liable to be sued, and that it should not have been dismissed, we cite the court to the following authorities: <em>Anthony </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>1 Metc., 284; <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Fairhaven, </em>5 Gray, 110; <em>Perry </em>v. <em>Worcester, </em>6 Gray, 544; <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Lowell, </em>11 Gray, 353; <em>Wheeler </em>v. <em>Worcester, </em>10 All., 591; <em>Prop. of Canal Locks </em>v. <em>Lowell, </em>7 Gray, 223; <em>Hildreth </em>v.

McMahon &amp; McMahon, </em>for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b266-7\">Our objection to the liability of the National Home is twofold:</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b266-8\">1. Institutions of this character are generally held to be exempt from liability for acts of mere negligence upon the part of employes or subordinate officers.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b267-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>2. The institution is practically the United States government, doing its work through a mere governmental corporation, which work could be as easily done through the war department, or any similar branch of the government, and' the government cannot'be sued in tort.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b267-6\">' I. The National Home is a mere branch of the government, to which is confined the care of its disabled soldiers. Section 4825, <em>et seq.'</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b267-7\">Revised Statutes, 1878. On .March 3, 1875, section 4831 was repealed. Revised Statutes Supplement, Yol. 1, p. 71.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b267-8\">In the year 1885, the method of appropriations for the support of the various homes was changed. Formerly the appropriations were in hulk for each institution. By the new law, congress requires the managers to submit detailed \u2022 estimates to the secretary of war, who submits the same in detail to congress, and by congress they are considered and allowed. This is the source of the revenue of the homes, and money is specially appropriated for specific purposes. Revised Statutes Supplement, Yol. 1, pp. 486, 513, 627, 928; Revised Statutes Supplement, Yol. 2, pp. 256, 257.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b267-9\">The home has no power of taxation, or assessment, no local government, no ownership of the ground or other property, except in trust for special purposes, no stock, no means of acquiring land or property, except appropriations and donations; and it is under the rules and articles of war. The character of the institution is well-defined in two cases in the Supreme Court of Ohio, wherein its nature was directly involved. <em>Sinke </em>v. <em>Reese, </em>19 Ohio St., 306; <em>Renner </em>v. <em>Bennett, </em>21 Ohio St., 431.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b267-10\">This corporation was established for the conven<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>ience of the government of the United States. All its duties could be performed without its intervention. The war department could take it in charge, and through retired officers could discharge the duties and obligations- with perfect satisfaction. Indeed, the proposition to make the change has been often advocated by'high officials.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b268-5\">To sue the home is to sue the government of the United States. Any judgment rendered could be satisfied only by a levy upon United States property. The distinction in cases of contract and tort is well stated in a recent case in the Supreme- Court of the United States. <em>Belknap </em>v. <em>Schild, </em>161 U. S., 10.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b268-6\">The remedy is against the officer, who must respond in proper cases, out of his private means. To sue the home is to endeavor to make the government pay. <em>Conwell </em>v. Voorhees, 13 Ohio, 524.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b268-7\">The District of Columbia has been held liable as a \u201cmunicipal corporation,\u201d <em>but only as such, </em>in several cases in the Supreme Court of the United States. <em>Barnes </em>v. <em>District of Columbia, </em>91 U. S., 540; <em>Railway Co. </em>v. <em>District of </em>Columbia, 132 U. S., 1; <em>District of Columbia </em>v. Woodbury, 136 U. S., 450.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b268-8\">There is little conflict of opinion as to such cases.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b268-9\">II. We proceed now to the second point made by us; namely, that aside from its being a part of the government of the United States, the nature of the institution is such that it is not liable under the law of Ohio, as established in our numerous decisions. This -ground is practically a reassertion of the reasons given under the first head.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b268-10\">A marked distinction has been recognized between municipalities and other <em>quasi </em>corporations in liability for torts or mere acts of negligence of officers or employes. And a distinction is drawn even in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>case of cities. Thus, in Ohio, cities have been held exempt from liability for neglect to quell a mob destroying property; for damages for failure to extinguish a fire by reason of a defective department or apparatus; for damages for defective plan of sewerage; for injuries resulting from permitting cannon to be fired in the streets; and for death resulting from the careless handling of defective fire apparatus in the public streets. <em>College </em>v. <em>Cleveland, </em>12 Ohio St., 375; <em>Wheeler </em>v. <em>Cincinnati, </em>19 Ohio St., 19; <em>Springfield </em>v. <em>Spence, </em>39 Ohio St., 668; <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Greenville, </em>42 Ohio St., 629; <em>Frederick </em>v. <em>Columbus, </em>58 Ohio St., 538.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b269-6\">The duties performed in the cases above referred to were found to be governmental, and not merely administrative for the sole benefit of the citizens combining into a city. But other classes of corporations \u2014 with full power to sue and liability to be sued \u2014have also been held exempt in Ohio, as the following references will show: <em>Commissioners </em>v. <em>Mighels, </em>7 Ohio St., 119; <em>Grimwood </em>v. <em>Commissioners, </em>23 Ohio St., 600; <em>Finch </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>30 Ohio St., 37.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b269-7\">In these cases, county commissioners were held free from corporate liability for defective courthouse, and the flooding of adjoining lands; and a board of education \u2014 a full corporation \u2014 was dismissed without damages for injuries received from defects in a schoolhouse.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b269-8\">The distinction is well illustrated by a more recent decision in Ohio, the language of which is practically decisive of the case, Assuming Judge Williams\u2019 clean-cut statement of the law to be correct. <em>Dunn </em>v. <em>Agricultural Society, </em>46 Ohio St., 93.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b269-9\">We assume that the law of the state of Ohio, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>found, in its decisions, will apply in so far as the liability of such institutions is concerned upon the principles of general law. Of course, if a federal question were involved, as would be the case if the immunity is claimed under the laws of the United States, final adjudication might be had in the Supreme Court of the United States, if the decision was adverse to the home.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b270-4\">The decisions in other states are in harmony with the rule in Ohio. <em>Williamson </em>v. <em>Reform School, </em>95 Ky., 251; <em>Perry </em>v. <em>House of Refuge, </em>63 Md., 20; <em>Benton </em>v. <em>Hospital, </em>140 Mass., 13; <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>122 Mass., 344; <em>Hearns </em>v. <em>Hospital, </em>66 Conn., 98.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b270-5\">Davis, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ATy\">The controlling question in this case is whether the defendant can be sued for a tort. It is a well established principle in our jurisprudence that no suit can be maintained against the United States, or against its property, in any court, without express authority of congress. In some of the cases it has been held that for the purposes of jurisdiction there is no distinction between suits against the government directly, and suits against its property. <em>Stanley </em>v. <em>Schwalby, </em>147 U. S., 508; <em>Stanley </em>v. <em>Schwalby, </em>162 U. S., 255, 269-270. The defendant is admitted to be a corporation. Territorially it is within the jurisdiction of the state of Ohio; but by the act of congress ceding that jurisdiction, it is provided that nothing contained in that act shall be construed to impair the powers and rights <em>in and over said territory </em>theretofore conferred upon the board of managers of The National Asylum for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers. These powers and rights were conferred upon the president of the United States, the secretary of war, the chief justice and nine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>others chosen from time to time by congress, constituting \u201ca board of managers of an establishment for the care and relief of the disabled volunteers of the United States army, to be known by the name and style \u00f3f \u2018The National Home for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers,\u2019 and have perpetual succession, with powers to take, hold and convey real and personal property, establish a common seal, and to sue and be sued in courts of law and equity; and to make by-laws, rules, and regulations, not inconsistent with-law, for carrying on the business and government of the home, and to affix penalties thereto.\u201d Congress reserved the right to at any time amend, alter or repeal the laws relating to The National Home for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers. This eleemosynary corporation, as it has already been denominated by this court, <em>Renner </em>v. <em>Bennett, </em>21 Ohio St., 442, therefore remains in all respects, as it was originally, an institution of the government of the United States for the administration of a charity of the United States. It continues to be, as it always has been, maintained by the funds of the government of- the United States. All of the property held in its name was paid for by the United States; and that it is performing an appropriate and constitutional function of the general government nobody doubts; for at this time it is too late to question the power of congress to create corporations for such purposes. <em>Osborn </em>v. <em>Bank of United States, </em>9 Wheat., 738, 859, 872; <em>McCulloch </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>4 Wheat., 316, 411, 422; <em>Luxton </em>v. <em>North River Bridge Co., </em>153 U. S., 529. But, as was remarked by Chief Justice Marshall, in <em>Osborn </em>v. <em>Bank of United States, </em>9 Wheat., 860, this corporation is not a private corporation but \u201ca public corporation created for public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>and national purposes.\u201d It is \u201can instrument which is \u2018necessary and proper for carrying into effect the powers vested in the, government of the United States.\u2019 It is not an instrument which the government found ready made, and has supposed to be adapted for its purposes; but one which was created in the form in which it now appears, <em>for national purposes only.\u201d </em>A suit against a public corporation having no other powers than the performance of a function of the government and accomplishing no other object, is plainly a suit against the government and its property, although nominally it is a suit against the corporation only. This principle was applied by this court in <em>Finch </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>30 Ohio St., 37, 47, in which it was held that in the absence of a statute creating the liability, a board of education, which was incorporated by an act of the general assembly, passed March 9, 1849, was not liable in its corporate capacity for damages resulting from its negligence in erecting and maintaining a school building. It was held that the defendant was \u201ca public agent employed in administering the common school system of the state,\u201d and that there is no principle of the common law by which the action could be supported.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">In <em>Board of Commissioners </em>v. <em>Mighels, </em>7 Ohio St., 109, a case in which the liability for tort of mere governmental agencies, in the absence of express consent of the sovereignty, is denied, Brinkerhoff, J., clearly distinguished municipal corporations and counties as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-6\">\u201cMunicipal corporations proper are called into existence, either at the direct solicitation or by the free consent of the people who compose them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-7\">\u201cCounties are local subdivisions of a state, created <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>by the sovereign power of the state, of its own sovereign will, without the particular solicitation, consent, or concurrent action of the people who inhabit them. The former organization is asked for, or at least assented to by the peopie it embraces; the latter is superimposed by a sovereign and paramount authority.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-6\">\u201cA municipal corporation proper is created mainly for the interest, advantage and convenience of the locality and its people; a county organization is created almost exclusively with a view to the policy of the state at large, for purposes of political organization and civil administration, in matters of finance, of education, of provision for the poor, of military organization, of the means of travel and transport, and especially for the general administration of justice. With scarcely an exception, all the powers and functions of the county organization have a direct and exclusive reference to the general policy of the state, and are, in fact, but a branch of the general administration of that policy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">This is exactly the distinction which we make here between the defendant in this case and municipal or commercial corporations.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">The general doctrine in regard to the liability of the government for torts is thus stated: \u201cEven the state or the general government may be guilty of individual wrongs; for, while each is a sovereignty, it is a corporation also, and as such capable of doing wrongful acts. The difficulty here is with the remedy, not with the right. No sovereignty is subject to suits, except with its own consent. But either this consent is given by general law, or some tribunal is established with power to hear all just claims. Or if neither of these is done, the tort remains; and it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>always to be presumed that the legislative authority will make the proper provision for redress when its attention is directed to the injury.\u201d Cooley on Torts, 122-123. The United States has consented to be sued on its contracts, either in the court of claims, or in a circuit or district court of the United States; but it has not yet consented to be liable to actions for torts. <em>Belknap </em>v. <em>Schild, </em>161 U. S., 17. Therefore, we are not persuaded by the argument that the power conferred upon this corporation, of suing and being sued both at law and in equity, must be construed as a consent by congress that this particular governmental agency may be sued upon any cause of action, whether sounding in contract or in tort. On the contrary, we are constrained, upon all considerations, to regard this as imposing the power and liability to sue and be sued in respect to such matters only as are within the scope of the other corporate powers of the defendant. The National Home for Disabled Soldiers was not given the right to commit wrongs upon individuals. It was not contemplated that it would do so. It was created and is perpetuated by the federal government for a very different purpose. Hence, it can not be inferred that congress meant to impose a liability upon this corporation so unusual, so different from its general policy and so different from the liabilities imposed on other public agencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">The defendant has no corporate fund, nor any property applicable to the payment of a judgment in such an action as this. A judgment could not be satisfi\u00e9d except by seizing upon the property and funds supplied by the general government for the purpose for which the defendant was created, and without which it must cease to exist. Execution against the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>ant'would not only bring on conflict between the state and federal governments, but if allowed, it would tend to the destruction, of this splendid national charity. It is no answer to these considerations to say that a judgment in damages for the tort would be an ascertained basis for an appeal to congress for satisfaction; for, as is said by the eminent author already quoted, it is to be presumed that the sovereign is always ready and willing to do justice, and a judgment in the courts, when unauthorized by the government, would not only be altogether vanity, an empty result, but would be an indecorous assumption of the right to advise the general government as to its duty, and of the right to make the judgment the basis of a demand precluding inquiry, by the general government as to its ultimate liability.' The courts can be better employed than in doing a useless thing.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">We, therefore, conclude that the right to sue The National Home for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers for a tort was never contemplated nor conferred. In <em>Finch </em>v. <em>Board of Education, supra, </em>this court so construed the power \u201cto sue and be sued\u201d contained in the charter of the board of education. Likewise in <em>Board of Commissioners </em>v. <em>Mighels, 7 </em>Ohio St., 109, 114-117.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">The judgment of the circuit is</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">!Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b275-9\">Burket, C.
