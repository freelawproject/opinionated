She filed a petition against the plaintiff in error, in which she alleges that the defendant is a corporation, and for a first cause of action says;</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b467-10\">\u201c1. Plaintiff, for a first cause of action says: On or about March 9, 1897, plaintiff agreed with defendant to erect a large factory building on a certain lot in Cincinnati, according to plans and specifications then\u2018being prepared by architects, and to be thereafter agreed upon; and after its completion to execute to defendant a lease on the property for ninety-nine (99) years, renewable forever, with a privilege of purchase. And in consideration thereof, defendant agreed to accept said lease and pay an annual rental of five per cent, upon the total cost in quarterly installments, and to pay all taxes and assessments.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b467-11\">\u201cPlaintiff proceeded to carry out said agreement on her part, and made \"contracts for said building, under which the old building on the site was removed, and sewers and water connections put in, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>cellar and trenches for the foundation dug, and costly material was contracted for and prepared, and while said contracts last named were being so carried out the defendant notified plaintiff to stop the further progress of the work, and that it would not enter into said lease.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b468-5\">\u201cBy reason of said repudiation of said contract by defendant, plaintiff was compelled to and did incur expense and loss of ten thousand four hundred and twenty-two dollars and fourteen cents ($10,422.-14), for work done and material ordered and prepared, over and above its value as old material, as follows: Loss on material, eight thousand one hundred and ten dollars; architect\u2019s fees, seven hundred and fifty dollars; excavation, eight hundred and fifty dollars; Greensburg stone, four hundred and fifty-five dollars; plumber, one hundred and twenty-five-dollars; permit, forty-one and fifty-five one hundredths dollars; survey and title, ninety dollars; total, ten thousand four hundred and twenty-two dollars and fourteen cents.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b468-6\">\u201cWherefore, plaintiff asks judgment for $10,422! 14 on the first cause of action with interest.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b468-7\">The defendant answered admitting that it is a corporation under the laws of Ohio, and denying each and every other allegation of the petition. On the trial it appeared that the plaintiff had obtained from one Bradford, a written agreement to convey to her for a cash consideration of $10,000, two lots in Cincinnati, and guaranteeing the title to be free, clear and unincumbered and acceptable to plaintiff\u2019s attorney; that Bradford died shortly' after making said agreement and without having conveyed the said premises; that plaintiff did not notify Bradford that the title was acceptable to her nor tender the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>consideration for such conveyance; and that Bradford\u2019s heirs refused to convey. The evidence to prove the anticipatory breach of the contract by defendant as alleged in the petition consisted of certain alleged oral statements made at the plaintiff\u2019s office a short time after Bradford\u2019s death, by James L. Anspaugh, one of the directors and the secretary of the defendant corporation. This evidence was objected to by defendant on the ground that there was no evidence to show that Anspaugh was authorized to make the said statements. The objection was overruled and the defendant excepted to the said ruling and also to the charge of the court as to the effect of said evidence. Other facts appear in the opinion. The verdict and judgment were for the plaintiff and the judgment was affirmed by the general term; and this proceeding is prosecuted to reverse the judgment of the superior court in both special and general term.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b469-6\"><em>Mr. Lawrence Maxwell, Jr., </em>of <em>Messrs.

There was no evidence of the authority of the secretary to speak for the corporation in this matter other than his alleged conversations as above stated; and it appears that the defendant for that reason objected to the testimony relating to the alleged statements by the secretary, and as to notice to the plaintiff by the defendant through the secretary, that defendant would not perform the contract on its part; but the court overruled the objection and admitted the testimony. This evidence is the pivotal point in this case. Mr. Anspaugh, the defendant\u2019s secretary, flatly contradicted the testimony as to the statements alleged \"to have been made by him. The court instructed the jury if he did make such statements that \u201cwould be <em>prima facie </em>evidence that the directors had so decided, and the plaintiff would be authorized to consider that he had spoken by authority of the board of directors,\u201d and that \u201cthen the burden of proof would be upon the defendant to show that he had acted without the authority of the board of directors.\u201d The defendant produced its minute book, which did not show any action upon the subject, and the surviving directors each testified that the board of directors had never authorized any one to notify the plaintiff that the defendant would not carry out its contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">The law relating to principal and agent is the same whether the principal be a corporation or a natural person. In either case the principal is bound only by the authorized acts of his agent. The extent of the agent\u2019s authority may be shown by the terms <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>of the appointment, if they are explicit, or it may be shown by a course of dealing by which the agent is held out as having an authority which would include the act in question. \u201cBut in whichever way this is done, it cannot be limited by secret instructions of the principal on the one hand, <em>nor can it be enlarged by the unauthorized -representations of the agent on the other.\u201d Mechanics Bank </em>v. <em>Railroad Co., </em>13 N. Y., 599, 632; <em>People\u2019s Bank </em>v. <em>St. Anthony\u2019s Church, </em>109 N. Y., 512, 525. See <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>27 N. H., 86, 97, 98; <em>Fay et al. </em>v. <em>Noble et al., </em>12 Cush. (Mass.), 1.</p>\n<p id=\"A0S\">In this state the corporate powers, business and property of the corporation <em>must </em>be exercised, conducted and controlled by the board of directors, Section 3248, Revised Statutes; and <em>prima facie </em>the corporate power of making or refusing to perform contracts on behalf of the corporation rests in the board of directors. Under our statutes, there is nothing in the nature of a corporate office which would imply authority to perform the functions which the statute imposes upon the board of directors \u00e1s a board, not upon the directors individually. The corporation may by its regulations, so define the duties of its officers as to make them <em>alter ego </em>within the assigned limits. Section 3252, Revised Statutes. But in the absence of express authority, and of such a course of dealing with the world as clearly implies authority to do the controverted act the corporation-can be bound only by its board of. directors. It appearing in this case, merely that Anspaugh was secretary of the company and that (giving the utmost effect to the testimony) he represented that he was authorized to speak for the board of directors, the trial court erred both in admitting the testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>which, was objected to and in instructing the jury that those facts alone shifted the burden of proof to the defendant to show want of authority in the secretary; and the superior court in general term should have reversed the judgment for those errors.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">The other questions which have been argued by counsel are not decided, because as to them the record seems to us to be incomplete and unsatisfactory.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b474-7\">Burket, C.
