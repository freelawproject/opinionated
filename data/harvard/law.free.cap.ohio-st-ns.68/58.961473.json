It is a generally accepted rule that the power of an administrator or executor over the estate of the decedent emanates from the laws of the state where he receives 'his appointment, and is confined to the territory of such state. It does not, <em>de jure, </em>extend to ether states, and cannot confer, as a matter of right, any authority to collect assets of the deceased in any other state. Such assets are to he collected and administered by virtue of the laws of such state, and accounted for to the proper court thereof. And the rule is the same whether the administration is general or with the will annexed.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AB3\">2. The statutes of Michigan do not, by comity or otherwise, \u25a0accord the right of an executor appointed in another state to administer the trust as to property in Michigan by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>force of the laws of such other state. Whatever right such executor acquires as to such assets must be obtained by virtue of the laws of Michigan, and he must account for the disposition thereof to the proper court of that state. Hence an Ohio probate court, although it has admitted to probate an Ohio will, and has issued letters testamentary to the executor therein named, has not power to review the accounts of such executor respecting property situate in the state of Michigan, and for which he has duly accounted to the proper court of that state.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b83-6\">3.

Stafford,, executor of Mabel Crawford, deceased, filed in the probate court of Lucas county. The record is long and much involved, but the facts following, gathered from it, are sufficient to show the grounds of error- and the questions disposed of. The testatrix, a resT ident of Toledo, deceased May 20, 1891, leaving a will which was duly probated and letters testamentary issued to Clay Crawford and William R. Staff ford, executors therein named, who accepted the trust. The substance of the will follows: After giving, by item 2, certain specific articles of personal property to an aunt, and after creating trusts in favor of other beneficiaries, the testatrix then gives $10,500 in trust for the benefit of the following parties, viz.: $2,000 to the American Missionary Association, $2,000 to the Methodist Episcopal Church of Caseville, Michigan, $2,000 to the Washington Street Congregational <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>Church, of Toledo, Ohio, $2,000 to the American Board of Commissioners of Foreign Missions, and $2,500 to the Protestant Orphans\u2019 Home, of Toledo, Ohio, and then provides:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b84-5\">\u201cItem IX. I hereby nominate and appoint said William R. Stafford and Clay Crawford executors of this my last will and testament; and I hereby give, devise and bequeath all my real and personal property of every kind and nature (save and except as is specified in item two herein), to said above named executors, in trust for the execution of my will, with power and full authority to sell and dispose of the same, at public or private sale at such times (within three (3) years after the date of my death), and upon such terms and in such parts as to them shall seem best, and I hereby authorize said executors or either of them, who shall qualify, to sell as above or lease or mortgage any part of my property, if in their opinion it is advisable so to do, and to execute and deliver any instruments or writings necessary or proper to carry into effect any powers granted in this will, and to sell and convey any or all my real estate in fee simple without being required to obtain any orders of court therefor, and with full power to settle, compromise, arbitrate or adjust any claim due either to or from my estate on such terms as they may deem best.

The personal estate in Ohio was more than sufficient to pay funeral expenses, and there were no other debts. Shortly after the will was probated an action was commenced in Lucas county by the mother of the deceased, to contest the will, which suit was pending until March 10, 1893, when trial was had and final judgment entered validating the will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b86-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>July 9, 1891, William R. Stafford was appointed special administrator of the estate by the probate court of Huron county, Michigan, and May 17, 1893, the will was probated in that court and letters testamentary issued to Stafford. These letters required Stafford to render a just and true account of his administration to that court. The bond was to like effect. Upon so qualifying as executor, Stafford, as required by the statute of Michigan, forthwith delivered to himself as executor all assets in his hands as special administrator. August 4, 1896, he presented his final account as such special administrator. Exceptions were at once filed to a portion of the items by Clay Crawford, executor, and especially representing the Protestant Orphans\u2019 Home of Toledo, Ohio, and the Washington Street Congregational Church of Toledo, Ohio, (legatees under the will), several of the exceptions being founded on the claim that the items were solely cognizable by the probate court of Lucas county, Ohio. Due notice, as shown by the record and found by the court, was given to all persons interested in accordance with the Michigan statute, and on hearing the exceptions were in part sustained and in part overruled. Prom this judgment Clay Crawford took an appeal to the circuit court for the county of Huron, Michigan. March 30, 1897, the account and exceptions were tried on the appeal in the circuit court, and by that court the account, as stated by the probate court, was approved. December 6, following, the probate court duly discharged, exonerated and acquitted said Stafford, as special administrator, from all liability concerning the estate, and cancelled the bond and revoked the letters.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b87-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>On August 4, 1896, Stafford also presented in the probate court of Huron county his first account as executor. To this account Olay Crawford, as executor and residuary legatee, and especially representing the Protestant Orphans\u2019 Home of Toledo, Ohio, and the Washington Street Congregational Church, of Toledo, Ohio, filed exceptions to all the items of the account, alleging among other things that they were not properly cognizable for allowance in the probate court for the county of Huron, but were solely cognizable by the probate court of Lucas county, Ohio. A time for the hearing was fixed, due notice given to all persons interested, and a hearing duly had, resulting in an order and judgment of that court allowing part of the account and disallowing part. From this judgment Stafford took an appeal to the circuit court of Huron county. At the March term, 1897, of that court, the cause was5 tried on appeal resulting in a reversal of the judgnient of the probate court save as to one item and a judgment otherwise allowing the account of the executor entered. The cause was then removed by writ of error sued out by Clay Crawford to the supreme court of Michigan, by which court, at its October term, 1898, the judgment of the circuit court was affirmed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b87-6\">November 10, 1896, Stafford filed his first account as executor in the probate court of Lucas county, Ohio, purporting to exhibit his transactions as executor arising out of that part of the estate situated within the state of Ohio. Hearing as to this account was postponed owing to the pendency of exceptions to his Michigan accounts. Exceptions to this account filed in the probate court of Lucas county were interposed by the Protestant Orphans\u2019 Home, of Toledo, by which it was sought to have the Ohio probate court review; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>the items of account relating to the Michigan assets and embraced in the Michigan accounts. These exceptions Stafford moved to have stricken from the files, averring: \u201c1. That this executor has never filed in this court any account containing items to which the said the Protestant Orphans\u2019 Home does or pretends to except. That the paper writing against which said exceptions are directed (except the items above set forth, which related to the Ohio estate), was and is solely a copy of an account filed by this executor in the probate court of Huron county, Michigan, and relates to that portion of said estate situate in said Huron county, and was filed in this court for the purpose only of advising this court of the progress of the' administration granted on said estate by the probate court of said Huron county, and which is and was entirely distinct and separate from .any administration granted by this court. 2. That said account has been fully heard, determined and confirmed by the courts of the state of Michigan, having jurisdiction thereof, and such hearing was had on said account and upon exceptions filed thereto by Clay Crawford, one of the executors of said estate, representing himself as such executor, and also representing said the Protestant Orphans\u2019 Home of Toledo, Ohio; and that all said matters covered by said exceptions filed in this court by said the Protestant Orphans\u2019 Home are <em>res judicata </em>between the parties.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AXq\">Pending the hearing the probate court ordered Stafford to file a complete account of all moneys received and paid out by him to February 1, 1899. This he failed to do except that he filed copies of his Michigan accounts. February 4,1899, a re-statement of the account was filed in the Lucas probate court and appended to. it an affidavit setting up the facts re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>specting his settlements in the probate court of Huron county, Michigan, and the action of that court and of the circuit and supreme courts thereon, as hereinbefore given. Setting up, also, \u201cthat by reason of the premises, all said matters contained in his said accounts as special administrator, and also in his account as executor, so appointed by the probate court for the county of Huron and state of Michigan, have been fully and finally determined and adjudicated by the courts having full jurisdiction of the subject-matter and persons concerned; that on or before January 11, 1899, he duly filed in this court certified copies of his said account as said special administrator, and as such executor, together with duly certified copies of the findings and orders and judgments of said probate and circuit courts of said county of Huron, and state of Michigan, and also of the judgment of the supreme court of the state of Michigan therein, to which he now refers and makes the same a part of this affidavit.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b89-6\">On hearing, the probate court of Lucas overruled the motion of Stafford to strike off the exceptions to the Protestant Orphans\u2019 Home, sustained all the exceptions to Stafford\u2019s account, and restated and settled the account, embracing therein the items or most of them, contained in the Michigan accounts, and thus formed an indebtedness against the executor of $22,526.12. From this judgment Stafford appealed to the court of common pleas of Lucas county, in which court he interposed the same motion to strike from the files the exceptions of the Protestant Orphans\u2019 Home, with this additional paragraph, viz.: \u201cThat by reason of the facts hereinbefore set forth this court has no jurisdiction to hear and determine the several matters contained in said alleged account <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>nor any of the same, except those herein above specifically set forth.\u201d This motion was sustained so far as the exceptions related to that portion of the estate situated in the state of Michigan, and which had been accounted for in the courts of that state, and the exceptions were all overruled save as to one item. The Protestant Orphans\u2019 Home thereupon took a bill of exceptions. Later, an order was entered, on motion of the American Missionary Society, and the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions, and the Washington Street Congregational Church of Toledo, legatees under the will, by which they became parties (the cause having thus far been prosecuted, as the court found, in the name of the Protestant Orphans\u2019 Home as one of a class, and for the benefit of all the legatees under the will), with full right to contest all issues still undetermined in this action, and with full right to institute proceedings in error founded on the bill of exceptions hereinbefore signed and filed March 12, 1900, and to do any act in relation thereto which either could have done had such bill been taken, signed and filed by these parties respectively. Thereupon, on further hearing, the exceptions of the Orphans\u2019 Home were overruled except as to one item of $355, which was found well taken. Judgment accordingly was entered, to which the ex-ceptors excepted, and carried the cause to the circuit court of Lucas county, where, at the Janu\u00e1ry term, 1901, of said court, the judgment of the court of common pleas was in all respects affirmed. The Orphans\u2019 Home, the Missionary Association, the Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions, and the Congregational Church bring this error proceeding to obtain a reversal of the judgments of the circuit and common <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>pleas courts, and an affirmance of that of the probate court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b91-6\"><em>Messrs.

The laws providing for the administration of estates primarily affect, reach and deal only with personal property; and neither an administrator nor an executor is, by virtue of his office, entitled to the possession or control of the real estate of a decedent, unless it be necessary for the payment of debts to sequester the rents, issues and profits arising therefrom, or sell the corpus thereof.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b91-8\"><em>(a) </em>At common law.

Hence it follows as a logical conclusion that any right to the real estate of the decedent which Mr. Stafford or Mr. Crawford may have, or to the rents, issues and profits thereof, was acquired, not by virtue of any office or appointment as executors, but solely from the will of the decedent; and this is the general rule of law. <em>Judson </em>v. <em>Gibbons, </em>5 Wend., 224; <em>Newton </em>v. <em>Bronson, </em>13 N.

A devise of lands is considered not as in the nature of a testament, but as a <em>conveyance </em>by the testator; and the devisee takes his title directly from the testator, not through the medium of the personal representative; and the title vests in him instanter upon the death of the testator.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b92-6\"><em>(a) </em>A devise is a conveyance. 2 Cooley\u2019s Bl., 378; 4 Kent\u2019s Com., 510; 13 Am. &amp; Eng.

The requiring of the probate of the will, or the recording of a certified copy of such will and its probate, in case of a will made in another state, is simply to put on record proper and sufficient <em>evidence </em>of the devisee\u2019s title. <em>Carpenter </em>v. <em>Denoon, </em>29 Ohio St., 379; <em>Richards </em>v. <em>Pierce, </em>44 Mich., 444.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b92-9\">Hence we hold that</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b92-10\">Y. When, at the probate of the will in Lucas county, Ohio, Crawford and Stafford accepted the devised property with the trusts thereon imposed, this real property vested in them as a conveyance direct from the testator. It never became assets in their hands <em>as executors, </em>nor had they, <em>as executors </em>(there being no debts), any right to any part thereof. But this property then vested in them as devisees charged with the execution of the trusts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>named by tbe devisor. Tbe fact that tbe same men are also named as executors in no way operates to lessen or impair tbe fee simple estate wbicb they took under the will directly from tbe testator as a devise in trust. Nor does this fact serve to change or modify in tbe least tbe propositions and conclusions heretofore reached.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b93-6\">It has been distinctly held by this Supreme Court of Ohio that a trust separate and apart from tbe ex-ecutorship is vested in tbe persons named as executors when,</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b93-7\">(a) There is a devise of real property direct to them, as in this case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b93-8\">(5) When from tbe assets of tbe estate they are directed to set off certain sums, or property, or a residue.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b93-9\">In tbe first case tbe property vests directly in them as trustees. In tbe second cas&lt;^ it vests in them as executors, and remains in their bands as executors till it is set apart to themselves as trustees and some definite act is done to change tbe character of tbe bolding. This position is clearly pointed out in <em>Gandolfo </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>15 Ohio St., 251.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b93-10\">1. There is a devise or bequest to tbe executor in trust, or where</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b93-11\">2.

In tbe former case, tbe executor receives them at once as trustee, and they never become assets.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b93-12\">Tbe reasoning of this case and tbe analysis therein made are (as to real property) so universally recognized as tbe law on tbe subject that scarcely a case will be found that does not conform thereto. And <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>where land is devised in fee to the person named as executor he is held to take it as trustee directly from the devisor and not through himself as executor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b94-4\">1.

Whatever may be the law of Ohio, or the general rule of law in the United States, as to the rights of Stafford under the will of Mabel Crawford, whether as executor or as trustee, the fact remains, that almost all of this estate was situate in the state of Michigan, and consisted mostly of real estate.

The probate court of Huron county, Michigan, having jurisdiction of this ancillary administration, had authority to require an accounting from Stafford, its appointee.

If the testator intended to create a separate and distinct office of trustee, nevertheless, under the will of Mabel Crawford, deceased, it was necessary that the executor should first qualify, reduce the estate to money, account to the proper court for the proper administration of his trust as executor, and then pay over to the trustee, <em>all sums of money </em>which were the subjects of the several trusts provided for in the will.</p>\n<p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b101-4\">Most authorities hold the doctrine that when real and personal property is devised to an executor in trust, with power to sell the same, and to pay over or invest the proceeds as trust funds, the person named in the will as trustee cannot take such property,-although'the same person be named both as executor and trustee, until such will is probated, letters of administration taken out, said property converted into money, and such executor has fully discharged his duties as executor, and not then until such fund has been distinctly set apart as trust property.

R. Stafford and Clay Crawford, as devisees in trust; that upon the probate of the will in Ohio and the acceptance of the trust by Stafford and Crawford, the fee simple title to all real estate in Michigan and elsewhere vested in them as such devisees in trust, and the probate court of Lucas county, Ohio, then acquired jurisdiction of such trust and of the trustees; that the probate courts in Michigan have no jurisdiction over testamentary trusts or trustees, chancery having exclusive jurisdiction thereof; that the exceptions which were disallowed covered items amounting to several thousand dollars of moneys received from the sales of land, and the products thereof, and expenditures for the cultivation of the land, all which items form part of the trustees\u2019 accounts over which a court of chancery has jurisdiction. Hence the confirmation of Stafford\u2019s accounts by the probate court of Huron county, Michigan, as to these trustee items, was without jurisdiction and void.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">That the title to the land is derived from the will and that it vested in Stafford and Crawford as devisees in trust upon their acceptance and qualification as such, and that the probate court of Lucas acquired jurisdiction as to matters relating to the trust which should arise out of assets in Ohio, need not be disputed, but the assumption that that court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>acquired jurisdiction over the conduct of the executors and trustees with respect to lands lying outside the .limits of the state of Ohio, does not follow. The claim is directly in conflict with the general rule, held in <em>Vaughan </em>v. Northup, 15 Pet., 1, to be: \u201cEvery grant of administration is strictly confined in its authority and operation to the limits of the territory of the government which grants it, and does not, <em>de jure, </em>extend to other countries. It cannot confer, as a matter of right, any authority to collect assets of the deceased in any other state; and whatever operation is allowed to it beyond the original territory of the grant is a mere matter of courtesy which every nation is at liberty to <em>yield or </em>to withhold according to its own policy and pleasure, with reference to its own institutions, and the interests of its own citizens.\u201d The same doctrine is announced by Justice Story, in his Conflict of Laws, where, at section 514, it is stated: \u201cIt is exceedingly clear that the probate grant of letters testamentary or of letters of administration in one country give authority to collect the assets of the testator or intestate only in that country, and do not extend to the collection of assets in foreign countries; for that would be to assume an extra-territorial jurisdiction or authority, and to usurp the functions of the foreign local tribunals in that matter. It is no answer to say that the effects of the testator or intestate are assets wherever they are situated, whether at home or abroad. * * * The question is not whether they are assets or not, but who is clothed with authority to administer them; and this must be decided by the local jurisdiction where they are situated, for the original administration has no extra-territorial operation.\u201d Again, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>speaking of ancillary administration, the author (section 513) observes: \u201cStill, however, the new administration is made subservient to the rights of the creditors, legatees and distributees who are resident within the country wherein it is granted; and the residuum is transmissible to the foreign country only when a final account has been settled in a proper tribunal where the new administration is granted, upon the equitable principles adopted by fo own law in the application and distribution of the assets found there.\u201d This is recognized law in Michigan, <em>Reynolds </em>v. <em>McMullen, </em>55 Mich., 568; <em>McIntire </em>v. <em>Conrad, </em>93 Mich., 526; in New York, <em>Parsons </em>v. <em>Lyman, </em>20 N. Y., 103, and seems to be the uniform doctrine of all the courts. It has been regarded as the law of Ohio from early times. In <em>Wills </em>v. <em>Cowper, </em>2 Ohio, 124, Sherman, J., expresses it thus: \u201cBut the very appointment, as well as the power of an administrator over the estate of a decedent, emanates from the laws of the country where he receives his appointment. The extent of his authority, and the manner in which it shall be exercised, depend upon legislative enactments, and is confined to the jurisdiction of the country granting the administration. <em>Doe </em>v. <em>McFarland, </em>9 Cranch, 151. An administrator, as such, can not intermeddle with the effects of his intestate in another state, unless permitted to do so by the laws of that state; otherwise it would be in the power of one state to regulate the distribution of property situated in another. And the rule is the same whether the administration be general or with the will annexed. In either case the authority of the administrator emanates from the law, and can not extend beyond the jurisdiction of the power conferring the authority; and the will being annexed to the grant of administration, does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>not change the tenure by which the administrator holds his office.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">It follows from this that the executors could have only such authority over the Michigan lands as is given by the laws of that state, and they provide for the appointment by the probate court of a special administrator where the validity of a will (as in this case) is contested, and of course such administrator would have to account to the court which appointed him. <em>Dickinson </em>v. <em>Seaver, </em>44 Mich., 624; 8 Miller\u2019s Compiled Laws of Michigan, paragraphs 9326, 9345, 9346, 9347. It is plain that the executors named in the will could have and did have, as such, no authority over the Michigan property so long as it was controlled by the special administrator, and it is not of consequence that the administrator was one of the persons named as executor. His authority came, from the probate court of Huron county, and to that court alone was he required to account. And when the will was probated in Huron county, and letters testamentary issued, it became, by the statute of \u2022that state, the duty of the special administrator to turn over to the executor the property in his hands, which was done, and the executor then succeeded to all the powers of the special administrator, and was subjected to the same duty to administer according to the laws of Michigan, and to account to the probate court for his conduct. Same statute, paragraphs 9330, 9345. All these steps seem to have been taken strictly in accordance with the laws of that state, and it is clear, from these statutory' provisions, that the state of Michigan has not, by comity or otherwise, extended the right of an Ohio administrator or executor to administer the trust as to property in Michigan in any other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>way or manner than subject to the laws of Michigan.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">It results that the adjudication of the courts of Michigan as to this estate is conclusive upon the plaintiffs in error appearing in those courts, and settles the controversy here against them, unless it is shown that such adjudication was without jurisdiction. The proposition urged by counsel, it will be borne in mind, is that the accounts rendered by Stafford to the probate court of Huron county, Michigan, were accounts as trustee, and not as executor, and that that court was without jurisdiction to adjudicate them, such jurisdiction being lodged exclusively in the chancery courts. An ingenious argument is produced in support of this proposition, but we do not find it necessary to give the question serious .consideration in view of the action of the parties subsequent to the judgment of the probate court. Recurrence to the record shows that Clay Crawford, in appearing as an exceptor in the probate, court of Huron county, represented not only himself but specially two of the plaintiffs in error, viz.: the: Protestant Orphans\u2019 Home and the Washington. Street Congregational Church. From the judgment of the probate court respecting one of Stafford\u2019s, accounts, Crawford, representing directly the other parties as well as himself, appealed to the circuit court of that county, and as to the judgment respecting the other account, he, with his co-exceptors, followed Stafford\u2019s appeal to that court, and there, as he had don\u00e9 in the probate court, took issue as to the justice and \u00e9quity of the items of the accounts, and 'challenged the right of the probate court to take cognizance of the items thereof on the ground that they were only cognizable by the Lucas county probate court. In short, the cause was tried in the eir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>cuit court on its merits. / it does not appear that any objection was made because of any lack of jurisdiction in the circuit court to hear and determine the issue, nor was there any objection respecting the way in which the controversy reached that court. Indeed it seems to be conceded that the circuit court is a court of general jurisdiction, thus possessed of power to pass upon its own jurisdiction, having also chancery powers; and such we understand to be the fact. Miller\u2019s Compiled Laws, paragraph 415. The parties, therefore, were then in a court which, according to the theory of plaintiffs in error, was such a court as should have been resorted to in the first instance. In that court the parties joined issue and the cause went forward to final judgment. How can the parties who then entered their appearance at the trial and submitted their controversy be heard now to dispute the jurisdiction of that court? We think they cannot. That the cause got into that court by appeal from a court which had not jurisdiction of it (if that be the case), rather than by original pleadings and process, was after all but an irregularity not affecting any substantial right, and one which may be waived. The record shows that it was waived. It was in legal effect not different from the submission of an agreed case, practice familiar to us by virtue of Section 5207, Revised Statutes, respecting any controversy of which the court would have jurisdiction if an action were brought, and which seems to be authorized by the law of Michigan. 3 Compiled Laws, paragraph 10414.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">We hold the law to be that where parties voluntarily, and without objection, submit to a court having jurisdiction of the subject-matter, their controversy, and the cause proceeds therein regularly to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>trial and final judgment, they will he held to have waived their right to object-to the jurisdiction of that court even though the cause had been taken into it by an appeal from an inferior court which had not jurisdiction of the subject-matter. The cases of <em>Pennywit </em>v. <em>Foote, </em>27 Ohio St., 600; <em>Spier </em>v. <em>Corll, </em>33 Ohio St., 236; <em>Scobey </em>v. <em>Gano, </em>35 Ohio St., 550, and <em>Cross </em>v. <em>Armstrong, </em>44 Ohio St., 613, cited and relied upon by counsel, have no application to the facts of this case, but the principle involved more resembles <em>Hallam </em>v. <em>Jacks, </em>11 Ohio St., 692; <em>Collins </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>33 Ohio St., 567; <em>Andrews </em>v. <em>Youngstown, </em>35 Ohio St., 218; <em>Kershaw </em>v. <em>Snowden, </em>36 Ohio St., 181, and <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Booth, </em>38 Ohio St., 405.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">If the conclusion that the parties who appeared as exceptors in the circuit court of Huron county and now appear here as plaintiffs in error cannot question the jurisdiction of that court is well founded, equally are the other plaintiffs in error forbidd\u00e9n to question it. Having applied to be admitted as parties in the common pleas of Lucas county, as legatees under the will, and there having been properly held to belong to a class for whose benefit the action had been prosecuted, and having there adopted as their own the exceptions filed by the Protestant Orphans\u2019 Home, their rights as plaintiffs in error rest upon the same foundation and are to be measured by the same rule that applies to the others who seek relief at the hands of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">It is suggested that the error case in the supreme court of Michigan was not heard on its merits but was disposed of on the ground of a defect' in the record. Nevertheless the judgment of the circuit court was affirmed, and the determination is equally conclusive as a final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>Having determined that the cause was heard and decided by a court of Michigan possessed of adequate jurisdiction to entertain and adjudicate it, and applying to the case the mandate of the constitution of the United States (article <em>4, </em>section 1), that: \u201cFull faith and credit shall be given in each state to the public acts, records and judicial proceedings of every other state,\u201d we necessarily reach- the further conclusion that the settlement of the accounts of Stafford as \u25a0 special administrator and as executor, mad\u00e9 by the circuit court.of Huron county, Michigan, and affirmed.by the supreme court of that state, is conclusive upon the courts of Ohio as a final adjudication of those accounts, and that the judgment of the Lucas circuit court and of the common pleas holding this to be the law should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\"><em>Judgment </em>affirmed,</p>\n<judges id=\"b112-6\">Btjrket, O.
