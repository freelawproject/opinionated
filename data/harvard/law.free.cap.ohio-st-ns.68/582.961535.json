Both were directors of that company; and immediately upon the consolidation both were made members of the directory and the executive committee of the new company. Mr. Robison was also made vice-president, and Mr. Shipherd, treasurer and transfer agent of the new company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b612-6\">The floating debt of the Cable Co., at the date of consolidation, June 1,1893, was such sum as, with interest to December 1, 1894, amounted to $420,318.86.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b612-7\">The firm of Taintor &amp; Holt was, during the time of the proceedings resulting in consolidation, composed of the following individual members: George H. Holt, G. E. Taintor, and G. D. l\u2019Huillier; they were directors of the Cable Co. and joined in the execution of the consolidation agreement.. Mr. Holt was one of the vice-presidents, and Mr. l\u2019Huillier was assistant secretary of the Cable Co.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b612-9\">On June 1, 1893, 100 shares of preferred Cable Cp. stock stood in the name of George H. Holt, and 200 shares in the name of Giles E. Taintor, both of whom were members in the firm of Taintor &amp; Holt, as above stated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b612-10\">In addition, on the same date, Taintor &amp; Holt held 13,300 shares of common stock, equivalent, on the basis of five shares of common stock to one of preferred, to 2,650 shares of preferred. This stock stood on the books of the company in the name of G. \u00c1. Schriefer, a clerk in the office of Taintor &amp; Holt, but was admitted, upon the trial, to belong to the firm of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>Taintor &amp; Holt. The jury rendered a special finding to the effect that the firm of Taintor &amp; Holt were the owners .of the 300 shares of preferred stock, subject to its pledge to the plaintiff hereinafter referred to.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b613-6\">In 1891, Taintor &amp; Holt borrowed of the defendant in error $25,000, and pledged with it as collateral security said 300 shares of preferred stock, indorsed in blank,which certificates of stock have remained in the possession of the bank since that date. Power to transfer was also indorsed upon the certificate, but that power was never executed, Taintor &amp; Holt remaining the registered owners of the stock on the books of the Cable Co. By the terms of these certificates they were transferable only upon the books of the company. On November 7, 1898, said Taintor &amp; Holt and the bank jointly made demand upon the Cleveland City Railway Co. for the issuance of a certificate of stock for Taintor\u2019s alleged proportion of the 18,250 shares, and offered to pay the portion of the floating debt chargeable thereto. A like demand was made on the same date on behalf of the said Holt and the bank jointly. Both the said demands were refused.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b613-7\">On November 15,1898, the bank took an assignment of said stock from Taintor &amp; Holt, and agreed to prosecute this action and account for any surplus recovered after payment of its debt.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b613-8\">Dividends paid upon the stock of the new company from June 1, 1893, to October 1, 1898, amounted to $10.25 on each share of stock outstanding.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b613-9\">The certificate for 18,250 shares was, after its issuance and delivery to Robison and Shipherd, trustees, indorsed by them in blank and deposited with the Savings &amp; Trust Co., the registrar of the consolidated company, and new stock charged up against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>it as issued by Shipherd. All the stock covered by this certificate had been issued against it by Shipherd on September 21, 1893, except twelve shares which were issued to M. A. Hanna, president, trustee, January 15, 1895, to balance the account. A large amount of this stock was wrongfully converted by Shipherd to his own use, and it is claimed that the portion of stock to which the bank claims it was entitled, by virtue of the 300 shares pledged with it, was a portion of the stock thus wrongfully converted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b614-5\">All of the stockholders of the Woodland Avenue Co. received their proportionate shares of the new stock covered by certificate No. 1.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b614-6\">On June 29, 1893, stock of the new company to the amount of 1995 shares was issued to Mr. Schriefer, for and on behalf of Taintor &amp; Holt, and sent by Mr. Shipherd to them, without the delivery of any of the certificates of the Cable Co.; but some time in 1896, 9975 shares of the common stock held in his name-were returned to Mr. Shipherd by Taintor &amp; Holt.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b614-7\">At the time of the delivery of this stock, no part, of the floating debt was paid by Taintor &amp; Holt; nor has any of the floating debt of the Cable Co. charged to all the stock held, at the time of the consolidation, by Taintor &amp; Holt, viz.: 300 shares of preferred and 13,300 shares of common, been held. No shares of the new company were ever issued for the balance of the preferred and common stock held by Taintor &amp; Holt.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b614-8\">At the time of consolidation there were outstanding 10,000 shares of preferred and 30,000 shares of common stock of the Cable Co. The relative value of the common stock, as fixed by a committee appointed by the stockholders, to-wit, Shipherd and Robison, was as five shares of common to one of preferred.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b615-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number><em>Messrs.

Tbe statute gave them tbe broadest powers. Tbe agreement they were authorized to make was \u2014 to prescribe tbe terms and conditions for the consolidation, tbe mode of carrying tbe same into effect, tbe name of the new company, tbe number of directors and other officers thereof and their places of residence, tbe amount of capital stock of tbe new company, tbe number of shares and amount of each, the manner of converting tbe capital stock of each of tbe constituent companies into that of tbe new company, <em>with such other details as they may deem necessary to perfect the new organisation and consolidation of the company.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b615-8\">It was therefore proper for tbe directors of tbe constituent companies to provide:</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b615-9\">First \u2014 That tbe constituent companies should come to tbe new company free of debt.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b615-10\">Second \u2014 That, of tbe stock going to tbe Cable Co., enough should be sold to pay tbe debt of that company.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b615-11\">Third \u2014 For tbe method by which this should be done, viz.: By tbe delivery of tbe stock in bulk to tbe officers and agents of tbe stockholders as trustees, and to whom tbe stockholders bad agreed to deliver tbe stock held by each respectively, to have tbe same transferred into their proper share of tbe stock of tbe new company after tbe payment of tbe debt.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b615-12\">It is hardly necessary to cite authorities upon tbe proposition that assenting stockholders are bound by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>the provisions of such an agreement. <em>Bradford </em>v. <em>Railroad Co., </em>142 Ind., 383; <em>Hale </em>v. <em>Railroad Co., </em>161 Mass., 443; <em>Railway Co. </em>v. <em>Hellman, </em>109 Cal., 571; <em>In re The Utica Brewing Co., etc., </em>154 N.

This declaration constituted a continuing affirmation upon which any lawful holder of the certificate had a right to rely, and his vested interest in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>such certificate could not he divested by any arrangement between the corporation and the registered owner. <em>Railway Co. </em>v. <em>Robbins, </em>35 Ohio St., 484; <em>Bank </em>v. <em>Lanier, </em>11 Wall., 378; Thompson on Corp., Secs. 2601, 2486 to 2489, 2501 to 2505, 2517; <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Zylonite Co., </em>122 N.

Therefore, the defendant railway company should have kept unissued the 342 .and a fraction shares of stock for the holder of the 300 shares of preferred stock of the cable road (the plaintiff in this case) until said shares of stock were surrendered.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b617-8\">By Section 3381, Revised Statutes, the stockholder in the constituent company is entitled to be present at the meeting called to consider the question of consolidation, and, likewise, by section 3383, he has the right to be present at the election of the directors of the new company. While the consolidation provided by our laws has some analogy to a sale, it is more accurately described as a union or amalgamation of two \u00f3r more companies. By the consolidation, the property and franchises of the separate companies become vested in the new legal entity; the stockholders in the old companies become, by the consolidation, <em>ipso facto </em>stockholders in the new company, with all the rights attaching to that relation; the old companies have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>become defunct. <em>Shields </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>4 O.

At common law there could be no sale of all the property of a corporation without the unanimous consent of the stockholders. It is questionable whether at common law there was any such a thing as we now know as a consolidation. But, in any event, there eoulcL not at common law be a consolidation except by unanimous consent, as a consolidation would materially affect the rights of stockholders. Power of the majority of stockholders and directors to consolidate and the terms and provisions of the consolidation agreement are such only as the statute gives. The statutes are the full measure of the power of the majority and anything incorporated into the consolidation agreement in excess of the statute was not binding.

The case, <em>The Utica National Brewing Co., In re, </em>154 N. Y., 268, is an authority in our favor.

There is no authority to delegate to others the duties and responsibilities imposed by this section upon the officers of the company.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b619-9\">The statutes must all be so construed as to be consistent, if that is possible. In the incorporation of ordinary companies the subscribers to the capital stock are the first stockholders. They meet and elect the first board of directors, voting at such meeting the shares of stock to which they have subscribed and upon which they have paid the preliminary assessments. Upon the election of the first board of di<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>rectors and not before, the corporation come into existence. Secs. 3239, 3382, Rev. Stat.; <em>State ex rel. </em>v. <em>Insurance Co., </em>49 Ohio St., 440; <em>Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Floyd el al., </em>47 Ohio St., 525; Morawetz on Corp. (2 ed.), Sec. 33; Sec. 3383, Rev. Stat.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b620-5\">By the consolidation statutes the stockholders of the constituent companies become stockholders in the new company. They do not make subscriptions nor do they pay assessments. The act of consolidation, whereby the property of the constituent companies becomes vested in the new company, dispenses with the necessity of subscriptions and assessments. The capital to be contributed by the stockholders has already been contributed. The number of shares to be voted by the stockholders in the consolidated company is determined by their respective holdings in the constituent company , converted proportionately into .the stock of the new company.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b620-6\">Davis, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ANi\">This case was orally argued before one division of the court; but it has been fully considered by the whole court. Only one of the assignments of error will be noticed in this opinion because, on the conceded facts, we are. of the opinion that the court \u25a0of common pleas should have directed a verdict and rendered a judgment in favor of the defendant; and failing to do this it was the duty of the circuit court to reverse the judgment of the court of common pleas and to render a judgment for the plaintiff in error. This conclusion results directly from the considerations following.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">By Section 3381, Revised Statutes, the directors of the constituent companies of a proposed consolidation are authorized to \u201center into a joint agreement, under the corporate seal of each company, for the consolida<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>tion of the companies, and <em>prescribing the terms and conditions thereof, the mode of carrying the same into efect, </em>the name of the new company, the number of directors and other officers thereof, and their places of residence, the amount of capital stock of the new company agreed upon, the number of shares of capital stock, the amount-of each share <em>and the manner of converting the capital stock of each of the constituent companies into that of the new company, with such other details as they may deem necessary to perfect the new organization and the consolidation of the </em>companiesIn prescribing the terms and conditions of the consolidation it is entirely competent for the directors to agree that the constituent companies shall come into the new organization free from debt, although if they do not do so the liabilites of such companies will attach to the new company as provided in Section 3384, Revised Statutes; and the directors are expressly authorized to agree upon the mode of carrying into effect the terms of the consolidation which shall be agreed upon. And further, the directors are not only expressly empowered to agree upon the manner of converting the capital stock of each of the constituent companies into that of the new company, but they are invested with the widest discretion as to the details of the consolidation, which may not be specifically included in the words of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">It was therefore lawful for the directors of the two constituent companies which were consolidated into the Cleveland City Railway Co. to agree, as they did agree, as part of the terms and conditions of the proposed consolidation, that the constituent companies should come into the consolidated company free from debt and that of the stoclr apportioned to the Cleveland City Cable Railway Co., enough should be sold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>to pay the floating indebtedness of that company, the remainder to be distributed among the holders of the common and preferred stock of the Cable Co., in proportion to the relative value of such preferred and common stock. The directors were also clearly acting within the powers conferred upon them by the statute when they made it a part of the terms and conditions of consolidation that as to all property matters between the two companies which were not specifically adjusted in the agreement of consolidation, they should \u201cbe adjusted pursuant to a memorandum of agreement entered into by the holders of more than a majority of the stock of said constituent companies, bearing date May 10,1893;\u201d because not only was it a certain and proper term or condition which might be stipulated for by the parties to the agreement, but it provided \u201cthe mode of carrying into effect\u201d the terms and conditions, and it provided \u201cthe manner of converting the capital stock of each of the constituent companies into that of the new company,\u201d and because it specifically pointed out and prescribed \u201cother details\u201d which, in the judgment of the directors, were necessary in perfecting the consolidation of the two companies. The agreement by the stockholders, dated May 10, 1893, was thereby read into and made part of the agreement of consolidation by the directors. So that whoever signed the latter agreement as directors must necessarily be held to have been cognizant of, and to have assented to, the agreement by the stockholders; and that is the position in this action of Taintor &amp; Holt, from whom the defendant in error claims to have acquired title to the shares in the Cable Railway Co. which it alleges that the plaintiff in error wrongfully converted to its own use.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>In prescribing the proceedings to effect a consolidation of two or more companies, the statute requires a ratification of the agreement for consolidation by the stockholders; and it virtually defines the term \u201cstockholders\u201d by requiring due notice of the time and-place of the meeting and the obj\u00e9ct thereof, to be given \u201cto each of the persons in whose names the capital stock of the company stands on the books thereof.\u201d Section 3381, Revised Statutes. There is no provision for notice to or requirement of participation by, a person who has a concealed equity in stock. A person who holds shares of .stpck in pledge, assigned in blank by the registered owner, may protect himself by having the stock transferred to him on the books of the company. Until he does so he does not become a stockholder. <em>Henkle </em>v. <em>Salem Manufacturing Co., </em>39 Ohio St., 547. \u201cIf the shares of stock are merely pledged by the assignment of the certificates, the holders would not be entitled to the rights, nor subject to the liabilities of the owners of the shares; they could only become owners by a sale and purchase of the stock pledged, on failure of the pledgee to pay the debt.\u201d Per Nelson, J. <em>Becher </em>v. <em>Wells Flouring Mill Co., </em>1 McCrary (U. S.), 62. The jury specially found in this case that on June 29, 1893, after the consolidation, Taintor &amp; Holt were still the owners of the stock and that on that date they received from the plaintiff in error all of the stock which they were entitled to receive by reason of their ownership of the Cable Co. stock. It appears therefore, the plaintiff in error having performed its agreement as to the registered and actual owners of the stock, that it is now sought to compel it to perform again, or account for the value of the stock, to a pledgee, who has not shown that it was entitled to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>more than a mere lien upon the stock at the time of the consolidation.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">We return now to the stockholders\u2019 agreement, which contains the following stipulations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-5\">\u201cThe undersigned stockholders of the Cleveland City Cable Railway Co. hereby appoint, and irrevocably designate, Frank DeH. Robison and John J. Shipherd as their agents and proxies to carry out this agreement and perfect said consolidation, and they are hereby authorized to attend any and all stockholders\u2019 meetings of the Cleveland City Cable Railway Co. called for the purpose of carrying out the terms of this agreement, and to vote all the stock standing in the name of each of the undersigned, in such manner as they shall find necessary to carry out and ratify all of the purposes of this agreement, and each of the undersigned stockholders in said company hereby agrees to deliver to said two persons, or their chairman, at such time as they may designate, all of the stock held by him, to be exchanged 'for stock of the consolidated company, in proportion to the respective holdings of each as each shall be entitled to receive the same.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-6\">\u201cThe method of organization of the consolidated company, and all of the details with reference to it, and the working out of the settlement and adjustment of the details of this agreement, are left by all of the undersigned to said * * * Frank DeH. Robison and John J. Shipherd, committee for the stockholders of the Cleveland City Cable Railway Co., to be agreed upon and to be to the satisfaction of each of said committees.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">These stipulations being incorporated by reference in the agreement of consolidation, which was signed by all of the members of the firm of Taint\u00f3r &amp; Holt, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>they and their firm must be held to have assented to the appointment of Robison and Ship herd. \u201cas their agents and proxies\u201d for all the purposes therein named, and thereby agreed \u201cto deliver to said two persons, or their chairman, at such times as they may designate, all of the stock held by them, to be exchanged for stock of the consolidated company, in proportion to the respective holdings of each as each shall be entitled to receive the same.\u201d The stock certificates which were pledged by Taintor &amp; Holt to the defendant in error, contained a provision that they were transferable on the books of the company only on surrender of the certificates. The utmost that can be claimed from this is that the duty was imposed on the Cable Co. to not transfer on its books without surrender of the certificates. But transfer on the books of that company was not asked for, nor was such a transfer by that company made. It was agreed by the directors of the constituent companies that 18,250 shares of the capital stock of the consolidated company should be distributed to the Cable Co. to be disposed of by that company, so far as necessary to liquidate its floating indebtedness, the remainder to be distributed among the <em>holders </em>of the stock of the company. The agreement was lawful, it was assented to by Taintor &amp; Holt,, and on the part of the plaintiff in error it was fully performed by the issue of the 18,250 shares of stock to Robison and Ship-herd as \u201cagents and proxies\u201d for the Cleveland City Cable Railway Co. and its stockholders to carry out the agreement of consolidation in regard, thereto. The designation of Robison and Shipherd in the certificate as \u201ctrustees\u201d instead of \u201cagents and proxies,\u201d does not alter the legal consequences of the transfer. Hence if there was any conversion of the shares be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>longing to Taintor &amp; Holt it was not by the plaintiff in error and it is not liable therefor.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">It is not for us to determine in this action whether the defendant in error has a cause of action against Robison and Shipherd or either of them, or against Taintor &amp; Holt, or against the Cleveland City Cable Railway Co. It is sufficient now to determine that the plaintiff in error is not liable for the alleged conversion.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">\n<em>Judgments of the circuit court and that of the court of common pleas are reversed and judgment for plaintiff in error.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b626-7\">Burket, C.
