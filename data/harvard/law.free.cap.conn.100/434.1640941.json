The plaintiff is under the duty to make, maintain and keep in repair within its limits all public highways, streets and roads, and has exclusive control thereof. The defendant is under the duty to make, maintain and keep in repair, all bridges within its limits, and as a part of such duty is bound to make, maintain and keep in repair all bridges within the City of Stamford except as such duty maybe changed or modified by Chapter 186 of the Public Acts of 1923. There are overhead highway bridges in the city of Stamford crossing a railroad. Until May 23d, 1923, railroad companies, by reason of \u00a7 3719 of the General Statutes, were obliged to keep in repair all structures over or under their tracks at any highway crossing, including the roadway and highway surface. On May 23d, 1923, \u00a7 3719 was repealed by Chapter 186 of the Public Acts of 1923, which provides, in part, that the roadway of any bridge crossing a railroad and the approaches thereto shall be maintained and kept in repair by the municipality having jurisdiction over and in which the same are situated, and that the framework or superstructure of any overhead bridge crossing a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>railroad, including the floor beams and stringers and its abutments or piers, shall be maintained and kept in repair by the company operating such railroad.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">The question which we are asked to give our advice upon is not a difficult one. General Statutes, \u00a7 1407 (\u00a7 2013 of the Revision of 1902) provides: \u201cTowns shall, within their respective limits, build and repair all necessary highways and bridges, . . . except where such duty belongs to some particular person. ...\u201d The obligation arising under this statute imposed upon the defendant town the duty of keeping in repair the roadways of bridges over railroads within its limits, except where such duty had been imposed upon some public or private corporation or individual. When the City of Stamford was created in 1893, its charter (11 Special Laws, 1893, p. 814, \u00a7 36) provided: \u201cand said town shall not be obliged to make or repair any highway within the limits of said city; <em>provided, always, </em>that the town of Stamford shall make, maintain, and keep in repair all bridges in said town, to the same extent as if this Act had not been passed.\u201d Taking into consideration the obligation imposed upon the town by \u00a7 2013 of the Revision of 1902 (now General Statutes, \u00a7 1407), in connection with this proviso of the Act of 1893, it seems an inescapable construction that the General Assembly did not then intend to relieve the town of its duty to maintain and repair roadways over the bridges within the limits of the city. At this time Chapter 220, \u00a7 7, of the Acts of 1889, had imposed the duty of maintaining and keeping in repair the structures of such bridges, and Chapter 244 of the Public Acts of 1893, amended \u00a7 7 of the Act of 1889 to read: \u201cIt shall be the duty of railroad companies to maintain and keep in repair all structures heretofore or hereafter erected over their tracks at any highway crossing, and the approaches to the crossing when the same are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>made with plank surface, and also to keep in repair the surface of the highway, including the planking or other surface material of the highway upon such structure. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">After the passage of this Act the duty of providing for the maintenance and repair of the roadways over bridges over railroads in the town of Stamford, then resting upon the town, was transferred to the railroad companies, where it remained until repealed by Chapter 186 of the Public Acts of 1923, which imposed upon the railroad the duty of maintaining and keeping in repair the framework or superstructure of the overhead bridge, including the floor beams, stringers, abutments and piers, and provided that the roadway thereover and the approaches thereto shall be maintained and kept in repair by the municipality having jurisdiction over and in which the same are situated. The purpose of this Act was to relieve the railroad from the duty of maintaining and keeping in repair the roadway upon these overhead bridges; and when the duty was taken from the railroad, it again fell upon the town unless it has been placed upon the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">The specific proviso in \u00a7 36 of the Act incorporating the plaintiff in 1893, appears as \u00a7 174 of the revision of the charter, in 17 Special Laws, 1915, p. 522, and again in the amendment to this section in 18 Special Laws, 1919, p. 206, \u00a7 1, in these terms: \u201cFrom the time when this Act shall take effect said town shall not be obliged to make or repair any highway within the limits of said city, provided the town of Stamford shall make, maintain and keep in repair all bridges in said town to the same extent as if this Act had not been passed.\u201d So that the duty of maintaining the bridges, which included the roadways over them, had ever since the incorporation of the city been specifically placed upon the defendant town.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>A bridge is a part of the highway, whether over a river, stream or railroad, and the roadway over it is a part of the bridge. <em>Norwalk </em>v. <em>Podmore, </em>86 Conn. 658, 664, 86 Atl. 582. \u201cThe word 'bridge/ when used in a statute, may or may not include its approaches, according to the context and the circumstances of each case.\u201d <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>East Haven, </em>44 Conn. 25, 30; <em>New Haven </em>v. <em>New York &amp; N. H. R. Co., </em>39 Conn. 128, 130; <em>New Haven and Fairfield Counties </em>v. <em>Milford, </em>64 Conn. 568, 573, 30 Atl. 768. As it is used in \u00a7 174, <em>supra, </em>its context clearly shows that it was not intended to include the approaches to the bridge. \u201cThe policy of this State,\u201d we say in <em>New Haven and Fairfield Counties </em>v. <em>Milford, supra, </em>\u201chas always been to impose upon towns the duty and the burden of building and maintaining all necessary highways and bridges within their respective limits, except where such duty belonged to some particular person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">The Superior Court is advised, upon this reservation, that it is the duty of the defendant, the town of Stamford, to maintain and keep in repair the roadways of the bridges over railroads within the territorial limits of the City of Stamford.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
