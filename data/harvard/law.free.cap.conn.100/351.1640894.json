The portion of the seventh article involved in the consideration of this question is as follows:\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b370-10\">\u201cUpon the death of my son, the principal of said fund of seventy-five thousand dollars shall immediately become beneficial to his child born during my lifetime if he shall leave but one, or to the issue of such child if he or she shall die before my son leaving issue, and in such case the remaining principal of the general share or parcel at the beginning of this Seventh article mentioned shall be distributed equally to all my grandchildren and the issue of such deceased grandchildren <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>as may be born during my lifetime, if any, they to take <em>per stirpes </em>and not <em>per </em>capita.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">The executors under the will of the deceased son of the testatrix, James G. Batterson, claim that the term \u201cin such case\u201d in the above excerpt from the seventh article of the will, refers to the expression \u201cor to the issue of such child if he or she shall die before my son leaving issue,\u201d and that as the child of her son, to wit, Walter E. Batterson, did not die leaving issue before the death of the son of the testatrix, the contingency under which \u201cthe remaining principal of the general share or parcel at the beginning of this Seventh article\u201d was to be distributed never arose, and hence it became intestate estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">This claim and construction, we think, cannot be sustained, as the expression \u201cin such case\u201d clearly refers to \u201cthe principal of said fund of seventy-five thousand dollars becoming beneficial\u201d to the child of her son born during testatrix\u2019s lifetime or to the issue of such child. This construction is so obvious and necessary, that the matter does not justify discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">As Walter E. Batterson, the sole surviving child of her son James, was born during the testatrix\u2019s lifetime, the principal of the trust fund of $75,000 did in fact become beneficial to him, the contingency arose in which (such) case the \u201cremaining principal\u201d was to be distributed, and the remaining principal did not become intestate estate. Question two must therefore be answered \u201cno.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b371-9\">The remaining question arises from the situation created by the death of the testatrix\u2019s son on January 17th, 1923. The testatrix, as appears by article seventh of her will, created several trusts out of one bah of the rest and residue of her estate, amounting to about $190,000. For each of her four grandsons living; when the will was executed she created a trust of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>$5,000. Three were children of her daughter and one the child of her son. She also created a trust of $75,000 for her son, James G. Batterson, Jr. Provision was also made in article seventh for the benefit of her son, for her trustees at their discretion to pay to him the net income of the balance of the one half of the rest and residue of her estate, and also portions of the principal. Article seventh then provides: \u201cUpon the death of my son, the principal of said fund of seventy-five thousand dollars shall immediately become beneficial to his child born during my lifetime if he shall leave but one, or to the issue of such child if he or she shall die before my son leaving issue, and in such case the remaining principal of the general share or parcel at the beginning of this Seventh article mentioned shall be distributed equally to all my grandchildren and the issue of such deceased grandchildren as may be born during my lifetime, if any, they to take <em>per stirpes </em>and not <em>per capita.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"Aay\">At the death of the testatrix\u2019s son in 1923, there were five grandchildren of the testatrix surviving, and no grandchild had died leaving issue; these five grandchildren consisted of one child of her son and four children of her daughter. The child of her son claims that under the above excerpt from article seventh, the \u201cremaining principal of the general share at the beginning of the Seventh article mentioned,\u201d now amounting to about $103,000, should be divided among the grandchildren of the testatrix <em>per stirpes, </em>whereby he would receive one half and the children of the testatrix\u2019s daughter one half to be equally divided among them. The children of the daughter of the testatrix claim that under the will the \u201cremaining principal of the general share\u201d should be divided among the five grandchildren <em>per capita.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">\u201cTo aid in the construction we invoke, first, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>paramount rule that requires us to ascertain if possible the intention of the testator from the language of the will and all the circumstances.\u201d <em>Raymond </em>v. <em>Hillhouse, </em>45 Conn. 467, 472. The child of her son claims that the language of the will indicates the intent of the testatrix to be that the \u201cremaining principal\u201d in question shall be distributed among her grandchildren <em>per stirpes. </em>He claims that the last clause of the above excerpt from article seventh, reading \u201cthey to take <em>per stirpes </em>and not <em>per capita,\u201d </em>should be construed to the effect that the \u201cthey\u201d has for its antecedent not only the \u201cissue of deceased grandchildren\u201d but also the words \u201call my grandchildren\u201d preceding. A reading of that portion of the will discloses that such a construction is so strained and forced as not to be sustainable. The \u201cthey\u201d who are to take <em>per stirpes, </em>are the issue of deceased grandchildren. Turning to the excerpt from article seventh, the provision that \u201cthe remaining principal\u201d in question \u201cshall be distributed equally to all my grandchildren,\u201d must therefore be read and construed free from any limitations arising from the words following in the sentence. A provision that property shall be distributed equally to all my grandchildren has a plain and unambiguous meaning under our law. Such a provision is a gift to a class, and such a gift is a gift to each member of the class <em>per capita. Post </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>70 Conn. 283, 39 Atl. 151. \u201cIn case of a gift to a class, where the proportionate share of each member is not determined by the will, distribution <em>per capita, </em>rather than by representation <em>per stirpes, </em>will generally be had.\u201d Gardner on Wills (2d Ed.) p. 403. This rule from Gardner is quoted with approval and followed in <em>Hoadley </em>v. <em>Beardsley, </em>89 Conn. 270, 283, 93 Atl. 535. See, also, 2 Jarman on Wills (6th Ed.) [1051]; <em>McIntire </em>v. <em>McIntire, </em>192 U. S. 116, 121, 24 Sup. Ct. 196; Schouler on Wills (5th Ed.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>Vol. 1, \u00a7 540; 40 Cyc. 1401. Since by our law a gift to a class indicates primarily a gift to the members of the class <em>per capita (Post </em>v. <em>Jackson, supra,), </em>the expression in the provision in question that the property \"shall be distributed equally\u201d makes the intent of the testatrix as to a <em>per capita </em>distribution practically beyond question. It is true that a distribution <em>per stirpes </em>might be upheld in spite of the use of the words \"distributed equally,\u201d if the will otherwise disclosed an intent to make a <em>per stirpes </em>distribution among the grandchildren, for a distribution <em>per stirpes </em>may be appropriately spoken of as \"equally distributed.\u201d <em>Raymond </em>v. <em>Hillhouse, </em>45 Conn. 467,473. But this will may be searched in vain for any indication of an intent on the part of the testatrix to depart from the import of a gift to a class as a <em>per capita </em>gift as it is recognized in our law. See <em>Post </em>v. <em>Jackson </em>and <em>Hoadley </em>v. <em>Beardsley, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">The testatrix discloses no intent in any part of the will to modify the recognized construction of a gift to a class, by any indication that she intended to make the gift to this class a gift <em>per stirpes. </em>The several uses of the terms <em>per stirpes </em>and <em>per capita </em>in the will show that she was fully informed of the meaning of these terms and competently guided as to their use. Therefore, if it had been her intent to provide that the gift in question should not be divided among her grandchildren equally <em>per capita, </em>the method to accomplish that result was at her disposal.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">The Superior Court is advised that the \"remaining principal\u201d of the estate, referred to in question one, should b\u00e9 distributed to the five grandchildren of the testatrix <em>per capita, </em>and that question two is answered in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">No costs will be taxed in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
