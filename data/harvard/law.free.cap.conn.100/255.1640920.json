Davis held sixty shares of the stock of the Land Company at the date of its attachment, and that the trial court erred in drawing its conclusion from the facts found that the Land Company was not so estopped, and in holding that it was only liable to the Park Trust Company to. the extent of the stock then owned by Davis, to wit, one share.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">The question that presents itself at the outset is whether the Wilkenda Land Company is so involved in the giving of the certificate in question by its secretary as to make it responsible in any way for the representation made in the certificate. Attachments of \u201crights or shares in the stock of any corporation\u201d are authorized under General Statutes, \u00a7 5869, set forth in the foot-note.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>The statute provides that the secretary of a corporation shall furnish the officer making the attachment \u201cwith a certificate, under his hand, in his official capacity, specifying the number of rights or shares\u201d held by the defendant, and it provides for the punishment by fine of a secretary who fails to furnish such a certificate.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">In view of the remedial purpose of this statute and the necessity of such a construction as to make it effective, we construe the provision as making the representation contained in the certificate of its officer a representation of the corporation, and if there arises from such representation an equitable estoppel in favor of the plaintiff in the attaching action, then the corporation would be bound by the representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">The representation of the certificate, standing alone, did not make Davis, the debtor, the owner of shares in a corporation which he did not in fact own, even as to the plaintiff in the attaching action. The mere fact that the plaintiff is misled as to the actual holding of the defendant in the corporation, and disappointed as to the result of its attachment, does not estop the corporation after judgment and make it responsible to the plaintiff in the attaching action for more than the actual holding of the defendant therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">The question before us, therefore, is whether, under the subordinate facts found, the court was justified in its conclusion that the corporation was not estopped from denying the truth of its representation, in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>certificate given to the attaching officer, that Davis owned sixty shares of stock, and therefore, that after judgment in the attaching action it was only holden for the actual shares of stock that Davis held at the time of the attachment.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">The representation in the certificate given the attaching officer was not true, the officer and the plaintiff believed it, but the vital question is, did the plaintiff change its position to its loss because of the representation made by the certificate of the corporation? In <em>Townsend Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Todd, </em>47 Conn. 190, we say, on p. 218: \u201cA party setting up an estoppel must always show, as an essential part of his case, that he will be subjected to loss if he cannot set up the estoppel. There is no presumption in his favor.\u201d Also, on p. 219: \u201cAn estoppel <em>in pais </em>operates wholly on equitable principles,\u201d and was \u201cnever intended to work a positive gain to a party, but its whole office is to protect him from a loss which but for the estoppel he could not escape.\u201d We reasserted these principles in <em>Webb </em>v. <em>Moeller, </em>87 Conn. 138, 142, 87 Atl. 277. These principles are at the basis of the Connecticut law of estoppel, and apparently are generally observed.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">As to the \u201cchange of position\u201d of the party claiming an estoppel, which is essential to its creation, Corpus Juris, Vol. 21, p. 1135, \u00a7 136, speaks as follows: \u201cIn order to create an estoppel <em>in pais </em>the party pleading it must have been misled to his injury; that is, he must have suffered a loss of a substantial character or have been induced to alter his position for the worse in some material respect.\u201d From the finding it appears that the Park Trust Company believed from the date of the attachment in December, 1918, until May 26th, 1922, that it held under attachment sixty shares of the stock of the Land Company owned by Davis, and relying on such belief took no further action looking toward the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>collection of the note than taking a judgment against Davis on January 22d, 1923. There is no finding that \u201crelying on such belief\u201d the Park Trust Company failed to attach any other property of Davis, or of the endorsers on his note. Any expense incurred after May 26th, 1922, was incurred with knowledge of the actual interest of Davis in the Land Company. As we said in <em>Townsend Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Todd, supra, </em>there is no presumption in favor of the party seeking to establish an estoppel that he has changed his position to his loss; he must prove that fact as an essential part of his claim. He cannot rely on presumptions or conjectures.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">The Park Trust Company urges that if it had not been misled in December, 1918, it might possibly have then found other property of Davis or of the endorsers to have attached, although it has not proven that any such attachable property was then in existence. To give such an effect to mere possibilities would be substituting \u201chazy and indefinite notions\u201d for the established equitable principles above set forth. In this connection, in <em>Hanna </em>v. <em>Florence Iron Co., </em>222 N. Y. 290, 302, 118 N. E. 629, the court spoke as follows: \u201cThe principles of estoppel . . . are reasonably well defined and plain, and we ought not to substitute for them some hazy and indefinite notions whereby in the supposed interests of justice a convenient theory of estoppel is predicated upon facts which do not fairly sustain it.\u201d The court was fully justified in its conclusion that the receiver of the Wilkenda Land Company was not estopped to show that at the time of the attachment Davis owned only one share of its stock, and that to that extent only was it liable, after judgment against Davis, to the Park Trust Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote orphan=\"true\">\n<p id=\"b272-9\">Sec. 5869. attachment op corporate rights or shares. Rights or shares in the stock of any corporation, together with the dividends and profits due and growing due thereon, may be attached and taken on execution. Such attachment shall be made by leaving a true and attested copy of the process and of the accompanying complaint, with the proper indorsement thereon of the officer serving the same, with the defendant or at his usual place of abode, if within the state, and with the secretary, clerk or cashier of such corporation, or if such corporation has no secretary, clerk or cashier, or if he is absent from the state, then at the principal place in the state where such corporation transacts its business or exercises its corporate powers. When an officer with a writ of attachment shall apply to such secretary, clerk or cashier for the purpose of attaching such rights or shares, the secretary, clerk or cashier shall furnish him with a certificate, under his hand, in his official capacity, specifying the number of rights or shares which the defendant holds in the stock of such corporation, with the incumbrances thereon, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>if any, and the amount of dividends thereon due, and upon the failure of any secretary, clerk or cashier to furnish such officer with such certificate, he shall bo fined not more than two hundred dollars. Such rights or shares, together with the dividends and profits, shall be held to respond to the judgment which may be recovered in said action for sixty days after its rendition; but no attachment of shares of stock for which a certificate is outstanding shall be valid until such certificate be actually seized by the officer making the attachment, or be surrendered to the corporation which issued it, or its transfer by the holder enjoined.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
