A demurrer to the indictment had been sustained by the county court and the defendants discharged. The State had obtained a writ of error.

Act of February 27, 1801, 2 Stat. at L., 105.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b270-8\">From that time until 1838 the circuit court had exclusive jurisdiction in both civil and criminal cases in the District. <em>Id., </em>p. 106, sec. 5.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b270-9\">There was no appeal or writ of error in any case, except to or from the Supreme Court of the United States. The right of appeal exercised as a matter of course in criminal cases by the State of Maryland about this time, the United States appears to have continued' to avail itself of after the passage of the act of 1801 above cited.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b270-10\">In 1 Cranch, 252, will be found the case of U. S. <em>vs. </em>Simms-, a criminal case, in which the government, in 1803, sued out a writ of error to obtain a revision of a judgment in favor of the defendant in the Circuit Court of the District, and which was argued and decided (against the United States') without any question being made- by counsel or the court as-to the right of the government to take up the case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b270-11\">Again,, in. 1805 the United States, iu a case in which- the-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>Circuit Court of the District had sustained a demurrer to an indictment, sued out^ a writ of error to the Supreme Court. U. S. <em>vs. </em>More, 3 Cranch, 159.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b271-4\">In that case neither the court nor counsel suggested any distinction between the right of the government and of the defendant to have a criminal case reviewed in the Supreme Court; but the court, <em>sua </em>sponte, suggested a doubt as to whether its appellate jurisdiction extended to criminal cases at all. The point having been argued the court held that it had no appellate jurisdiction whatever in criminal cases.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b271-5\">In consequence of this ruling, from 1805 to 1838 there was no appeal in this District in a criminal case by either party. Before 1805 both parties appealed; from 1805 to 1838 neither party could appeal; all the time there was perfect equality.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b271-6\">By the act of July 7, 1838, the \u201cCriminal Court of the District of Columbia\u201d was created. 5 Stat. at L., 306.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b271-7\">That act provided for a writ of error to the Circuit Court in any criminal case wherein final judgment shall have been pronounced \u201cconvicting any person of any crime or misdemeanor.\u201d Thus the statute by its very terms prevented the government from appealing, because appeals were not to be allowed when the judgment was in favor of the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b271-8\">This continued to he the state of the law until March 3, 1863, when this court was created. 12 Stat. at L., 762.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b271-9\">The fifth section of that act, as already stated, contained the provision as to appeals which is now incorporated in section 772 of the Revised Statutes of the District. It gave any person aggrieved by a judgment at any Special Term the right to appeal to the G-eneral Term.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b271-10\">But, as already stated, the Supreme Court decided in <em>Ex parte </em>Bradley that the Criminal Court, although held by a judge of the Supreme Court of the District, was not a special term. Hence the act of 1838 still regulated appeals from the Criminal Court, and the United States could not appeal because no statute authorized it to do so.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b271-11\">Finally, by the act of June 21, 1870, 16 Stat. at L., 160, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>the Criminal Court was declared to be a Special Term of this court; and thereafter the law on this subject remained as it is now.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b272-4\">It is said that no appeal has been taken by the United States in a criminal case in this District since the act of 1810. This may be the case. It is a right not to be exercised merely because it exists. In State <em>vs. </em>Buchanan, supra, the court, while deciding in favor of the light of the State to appeal, says: \u201c It is, perhaps, a right that should be seldom exercised.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b272-5\">Suppose the case to be, then, that the United States has not attempted to appeal in a criminal case in this District for sixteen years. On what ground and by what analogy can that fac.t be said to control the construction of the statute giving it the right to appeal? I leave it to the defendant\u2019s counsel to answer the question. In the <em>habeas corpus </em>case of Taylor, already cited, the act giving the right of appeal was enacted in 1842, and the United States did not in fact take an appeal until 1819.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b272-6\"><em>The rule in other courts of the United States ; </em>The decision in U. S. <em>vs. </em>More, <em>supra, </em>was put upon the ground that the act giving the right to a writ <em>of </em>error to the Circuit <em>Court </em>of the District limited it to cases where the \u201cmatters in dispute\u201d should exceed the value of $-100, which did not, as the court says, apply to criminal cases, because in these cases \u201cthe question is the guilt or innocence of the prisoner.\u201d But the law granting appeals and writs of error in cases , arising in the Circuit Courts of the United States, now and ever since 1189, contains a similar provision.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b272-7\">The right to a review in the appellate court has 'been restricted in the judicial system of the United States to cases in which the matter in dispute exceeds the value of so many dollars.'

Act of February 22, 1847, sec. 4, 9 Stat. at L., 129.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b273-6\">In Forsythe's Case the appeal was in fact by the defendant.

State <em>vs. </em>Kemp, 17 Wis., 690.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b275-9\">Mr. Chief -Justice CarTter</author>\n<p id=\"AN8\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-10\">This case, while one ef importance, is confined within very brief limits. The question is, whether the United States has the right of appeal to this court when a judgment has been rendered by the Criminal Court sustaining a demurrer to an indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-11\">The Constitution provides that no man shall be twice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>put in jeopardy for the same offence. In the case of United States <em>vs. </em>Bigelow, 3 Mackey, 393, we held, after a deliberate and exhaustive discussion, that a man has only been in jeopardy when he has had a trial and verdict in his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">The question, therefore, whether the defendant has been put in jeopardy by the hearing of this demurrer in the court below has been practically determined by us in the negative, and we are left disembarrassed upon that point to discuss and consider the Government's right of appeal from a judgment against it on the demurrer. This question is to be determined solely by an interpretation of the statute; for it is a settled doctrine that the right of appeal rests with the legislature alone. .If the statute is silent on the subject, it leaves the complaining party unrelieved, since the grant of appeal in terms to one party necessarily by the expression of that grant confers no such right upon the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">Counsel for the United States accept this proposition, and very frankly say that if the right does not exist by statute, it does not exist at alL But it is insisted that the statute gives that right, although, under a misconception of its meaning, the right has never been exercised heretofore.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">The statute under which this right of appeal is claimed is section lili2 of the Revised Statutes of this District, and is a part of the act organizing this court. It reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-7\">\u201cAny party aggrieved by any order, judgment or decree made or pronounced at any special term, may, if the same involve the merits of the action or proceeding, appeal therefrom to the General Term of the Supreme Court, and upon such appeal the General Term shall review such order, judgment or decree, and affirm, reverse or modify the same as shall be just.\"</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-8\">\u201cAny party,\u201d of course, means all parties, which includes, if it refer to criminal cases, not only the defendant but the United States, for the United States is as much a party as the accused.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-9\">If therefore this section applies to the Criminal Court of the District there can be no doubt of the government\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>right of appeal. Unfortunately, however, for this argument, the Supreme Court of tbe United States has held that the Criminal Court formed no part of this court at the time of the enactment of this statute, but was a distinct and independent court. That being the case it cannot be considered to have been included by the legislative language or intention when the statute organizing this court and regulating appeals from its several special terms to the General Term was enacted.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">And this will more plainly appear by reference to a statute enacted at a subsequent period, by which the criminal court was made a co-ordinate branch of this court. That act, which was passed June -21, 1870, and is embodied in section 758 of the Revise Statutes of the District, declares:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-5\">\u201cThe several General Terms and Special Terms of the circuit court, district courts and criminal courts, authorized by law, are declared to be, severally, terms of the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia; and the judgments * * * of the * * * criminal courts * * * shall be deemed judgments * * * of the Supreme Court; <em>but nothing contained in this section shall effect the right of appeal as provided by law.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">It is argued by the government that these words refer to the right of appeal as declared by section 772 of the organic act. That is quite true as far as it goes, but it refers to more. The difficulty lies in a misconception of the purview of that section. There was not, as we have seen, and there could not have been any intention to include the criminal court in the provisions of the organic act. As the law then stood, the defendant in the criminal court was given the right of appeal, a right which was denied to the prosecution. Congress, by the act of 1870, merely left the right of appeal as it found it, and, in our opinion, we would not be leaving the law where it has been left by Congress if we applied the provisions of section 772 to the criminal court, and thereby give the right of appeal to the United States. That is all there is to this question.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-9\">The appeal must be dismissed, and it is so ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
