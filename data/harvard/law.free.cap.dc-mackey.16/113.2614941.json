The ordinary rule is that a devise of land without any indication of the extent of the interest devised gives only a life estate.

The English courts do not follow the latter branch of the above rule. Because of their policy to keep the estate together, they decline to construe a will so as to take the inheritance from the heir, except upon plain ex-presions of intent in the particular instance ; but the policy of our laws of inheritance is subdivision among heirs, so that courts are not called upon to watch over the inheritance for the same reasons.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b129-8\">3.

The sale was at auction, a fee simple being guaranteed to the purchaser. The defendant Crenshaw was the highest bidder, and became the purchaser on these terms. On examining the title he became doubtful whether more than a life estate was taken by Mrs. Johnsen under the devise, and accordingly refused to complete the purchase; whereupon the bill in this cause was filed to compel a performance of the contract of sale.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b131-6\">The only question before the court was whether a life estate or a fee simple was devised by the will to Mrs, Johnson.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b131-7\">Worthin&amp;ton &amp; Heard for plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b131-8\">John B. Earner for defendants:</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b131-9\">A careful examination of the authorities on this subject, both English and American, shows that at one time the strict technical rule of law was applied to devises of this character, and unless the testator used, in connection with the devise, some technical expression, such as \u201cheirs forever,\u201d \u201cassigns forever,\u201d or \u201cfee simple,\u201d the estate which would pass under the will would only be an estate for life ; while in deeds the word \u201c heirs \u201d was absolutely essential. 3 Jarm., Wills, last ed., p. 20.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b132-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>The general rule that a devise without words of inheritance carries only a life estate prevails in this country, in absence of statutes to the contrary.

The intention of the testator must decide all doubts arising on the face of the will itself, without reference to any extrinsic circumstances; and this court in the case of French <em>vs. </em>Campbell, 2 Mackey, 321, has followed this rule.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b132-5\">The mere fact that the testator devises lands after the termination of a life estate will not show an intent to give the remainder in fee. Olmstead <em>vs. </em>Harvey, 1 Barb., 102,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A6k\">There must be something more than the bare devise\\ The use of the word \u201cestate,\u201d \u201cremainder,\u201d \u201creversion,\u201d or \u201c lands and tenements,\u201d would in some cases carry with it an absolute estate, because it would tend to show an intention to devise all the interest of the testator. 4 Kent Com., p. 535.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b132-8\">The case of French <em>vs. </em>Campbell, <em>supra, </em>is relied upon by the complainant as conclusively settling the dispute in the case at bar. But it is submitted that that case only goes so far as to hold that the intention of the testator is supreme in the construction of wills, and by no means does the decision of the court justify the syllabus given by the reporter.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b132-9\">Mr. Justice James</author>\n<p id=\"ARg\">delivered the opinion of the court:</p>\n<p id=\"b132-10\">Whether Mrs, Emily Johnson took a fee simple or only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>a life estate, under the will of Mrs. Lamed, is th\u00e9 only question in this case. That will contains the following devises :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-4\"><em>\u201c </em>First. I give, devise and bequeath to my beloved mother, 'Mrs. Elizabeth H. Newman, the lot and house in which I now live, in the city of Washington, together with my household and kitchen furniture therein at the time of my death, to hold the said house and lot and furniture during her natural life, and after her death I give, devise and bequeath the said house and lot to my beloved sister, Mrs. Emily Johnson. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-5\">\u201c I give and bequeath and devise to my neice, Elizabeth B. Bichardson, daughter of my sister Emily, all my property in the city of Baltimore on which there are payable ground rents.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-6\"><em>\u201c </em>Item. I give, devise and bequeath to McClintock Young, junior, and Alexander Young, junior, the children of my beloved sister, Susan Bird Young, my house and lot on St. Paul street, between Baltimore and Fayette streets, in the city of Baltimore, to hold the same as tenants in common. If either of my said nephews, McClintock and Alexander, should die before arriving at the age of twenty-one years, this devise shall inure to the benefit of the survivor and his heirs.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">In two instances the devise contains no indications that an inheritable estate is given. But in the third instance, where just the same language is used in giving the house in Baltimore to the two Youngs, the testatrix assumed that her words had given such an estate, for she goes on to say that <em>\u201c </em>if either of my said nephews, McClintock or Alexander, should die before arriving at the age of twenty-one years, this devise shall inure to the benefit of the survivor and his heirs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">The ordinary rule is that a devise of land without any indication of the extent of the interest devised, gives only a life estate. The question, however, is, whether there may be gathered from expressions in other parts of the will, evidence that, in using this language, the testator intended to give a fee simple. Undoubtedly the English rule is that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>such indications in other parts of the will affect only the provision to which they directly apply. They are not accepted as going to explain the testator\u2019s meaning in the use of phraseology elsewhere.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">But the English rule is founded upon reasons which do not exist with us. When the statute of wills was passed, there already existed a policy to keep the estate together and in one hand. Therefore the courts very properly declined to construe wills as taking the inheritance from the heir except upon plain expressions of intent in the particular instance. But the policy of our laws of inheritance is subdivision among heirs, so that our courts are not called upon to watch over the inheritance for the same reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">We are not at liberty, in construing a will, to ignore anything that suggests the testator\u2019s intention to take the inheritance from the heir ; on the contrary, we are charged with a duty to observe these indications and to follow them in ascertaining the intention of the testator.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">In this case we find that when the testatrix gave a piece of land to two nephews in Baltimore by just the same language, and without the use of the word heirs, or any equivalent, she <em>assumed </em>that she had given them a fee simple, and therefore went on to state what should be done in case of the death of either of them before they became twenty-one years of age. We learn in this way what the testatrix supposed and intended to be the effect of a devise of a described piece of property, without using words of inheritance or any particular 'equivalent for them, and we must be guided by her lexicon and understand her language as she defines it. We infer, therefore, from this devise, that she supposed she had given a fee simple to Mrs. Emily Johnson by the same language.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">Applying that to the language used in the first item, where she gave a life estate in express terms to her mother, and then, at her mother\u2019s death, gave the same property to her sister, with no words indicating the estate to be taken, we think that the two illustrations of her meaning furnished by the other devises would alone be sufficient to show that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>when she gave property without any reservations, she understood herself to be giving the fee simple.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">But in this very item which contains the devise to Mrs. Johnson there is still another indication of her intention to pass a fee simple. She first gives the property to her mother in express terms for life, thereby indicating that when she intended to give it for life she said so. Does not this indicate that she understood herself to be doing something quite different when she proceeded next to give the same house to her sister? On these two grounds we think it is clear that the testatrix intended to give a fee simple to Mrs. Johnson.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">The decree will be for the specific performance of the contract.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
