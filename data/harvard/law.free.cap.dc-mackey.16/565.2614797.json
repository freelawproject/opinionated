In an action against the principal and his sureties on an official bond the principal failed to defend, but no judgment was taken against him. On the trial, the evidence being held insufficient against the sureties, and the court being about to direct .a verdict in their favor, the plaintiff, consented that the principal should be included therein. <em>Held, </em>that the consent verdict in favor of the principal worked a discharge of the sureties, even though the court was in error in its rulings as to the sufficiency of the evidence against them.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b581-8\">3.

Mattoon did not defend the action, hut Hi\u00f1e and Grant filed pleas of covenant performed. No judgment was taken against the principal, but the trial proceeded on the issue made by the sureties. To establish its case the plaintiff offered certain transcripts from the United States Treasury which were excluded by the court, on the ground of their incompleteness. The bill of exceptions then proceeds to state that \u201cThereupon the plaintiff having offered no further evidence, and its attorney having stated that judgment against Mattoon might emharass his further proceedings and that he waived that, and there was nothing to be done but to render a verdict for the defendants in the case, the court instructed the jury to return a verdict for the defendants; to which instruction of the court the plaintiff, by its attorney, duly excepted.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b582-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>Randolph Coyle, for the United States:</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b582-4\">The point is made by appellees in their brief, that, by failing to take a judgment against Mattoon, the Government hap lost its recourse against the sureties. In fact the reverse of this proposition is true. If judgment had been taken as suggested, the sureties would have been released.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b582-5\">The suit was joint, and there can be but one judgment in such a case, either against or in favor of all the defendants. See Freeman, Judgments, sec. 43; Taylor <em>vs. </em>Beck, 3 \u00c9and., 316; Steptoe <em>vs. </em>Read, 19 Gratt., 1; Baber <em>vs. </em>Cook, 11 Leigh, 606; Rohr <em>vs. </em>Davis, 9 Leigh, 30 ; Beltzhoover <em>vs. </em>Commonwealth, 1 Watts, 126 ; Williams <em>vs. </em>M\u2019Fall, 2 Serg, <em>&amp; </em>R., 128.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b582-6\">The common law rule has not been changed by sections 827, R.

The sureties pleaded to issue ; the principal entered no plea whatever. In this state of case, instead of taking a judgment by default against the principal and an inquiry of damages as to him, before the, same jury which tried the issues against the sureties, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>plaintiff passed over the default, and tried the whole case upon issues, as well against the principal as against the sureties ; and when the court ruled that the offered evidence was insufficient to maintain the action against the sureties the plaintiff consented to a verdict in favor of the principal, and the verdict was accordingly rendered for all the defendants, and judgment, <em>inde. </em>This worked a discharge, final and irrevocable, as to the principal debtor, by the plaintiff\u2019s consent; and the principal being discharged, it follows that the sureties are also discharged, by operation of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-3\">The apprehension of prejudice to its rights from proceeding to final judgment against the principal, even if such result would have followed, might have been, and ought to have been, obviated by the course already suggested as the proper one, viz: of taking a judgment by default for want of a plea against the principal, and then, submitting to the trial jury an inquiry of damages against him. And if, upon beginning the inquiry of damages before the same jury which tried the issues, the plaintiff had been met by any impediment to a verdict against the other defendants, the attorney might then have de'clined to proceed further with the inquiry of damages, and have withdrawn that from the jury, to be renewed when he should on error have reversed the rulings in favor of other defendants, Tidd, pr. 895.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-4\">Or the plaintiff might have entered a <em>nolle prosequi </em>against the principal, as was done in the case of Minor <em>vs. </em>Mechanics Bank of Alexandria, 1 Pet., 46.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">By either of those courses the plaintiff\u2019s rights could have .been saved, while prosecuting an appeal against the sureties.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">As the matter now stands, however, this court must affirm the judgment in favor of all the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
