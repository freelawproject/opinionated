It is the name given to our great Republic, which is composed of States and Territories. The District of Columbia, or the territory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>west of the Missouri, is not less within the United States than Maryland or Pennsylvania; and it is not less necessary, on the principles of our constitution, that uniformity in the imposition of imposts, duties and excises, should be observed in one than in the other. Since, then, the power to lay and collect taxes, * * * is obviously coextensive with the power to lay and collect duties, imposts and excises, and since the latter extends throughout the United States, it follows that the power to impose direct taxes also-extends throughout the- United States.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b508-3\">Clause 6 of the same section provides that \u201c No preference shall be given by any regulation of commerce or revenue to the ports of one State over those of another.\u2019 See Passenger Cases, 7 How., 405; Gibbons <em>vs. </em>Ogden, 9&gt; Wheat., 191.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b508-4\">Now if this License Law does give or may give the city of Baltimore any preference over the city of Washington, or the contrary, it is in violation of this clause of the constitution.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b508-5\">We contend therefore that even if Congress had formally passed this law, and it had been regularly approved by the President, with all the forms prescribed for the enactment of laws of the United States, it would still be void, because of its violation of the fundamental requirement of all such legislation, to wit; that of uniformity throughout the limits of the country.

This, however, is a very unsatisfactory foundatian for it. The organic act, * *\u2022 * which established the District government, nowhere contains an intimation that the acts of the new government are to be inoperative until or unless confirmed by Congress; butt, on the contrary, by the1 strongest imputation,, excludes such idea. The fiftieth section [of the revision} declares that all acts of the legislative assembly shall ajt all times be subject to-repeal or modification by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>the Congress of the United States. Until repealed or modified, the clear implication is that they are to <em>operateproprio vigore. </em>* * * It is plain to us that as far as Congress could confer the power of original and independent legislation, needing no confirmation, but complete and operative in itself, it has done so by the act in question.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b511-5\">The effect of this is that the legislation in question, being that of a duly authorized and qualified agent of Congress in the government of the District of Columbia, is that of Congress itself. And if that be not so, we have a distinct adoption by Congress of this legislation in the several Acts of February IT, 18T3, (IT Stat. at L., 464), July 12, 18T6, (sec. 19, 19 Stat. at L., 88), and January 28, 188T, in part amending and in part repealing the act of the assembly ; whereby, by the clearest implication, the rest of the act is adopted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b511-6\">II. The constitutional question.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b511-7\">The question raised by the petitioner is supposed to find support in article I, sec. 8, of the Constitution of the United States, which provides that \u201c The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises * * * bat all duties, imposts, and excises shall be uniform throughout the United States,\u201d (clause 1,) and that \u201cThe Congress shall have power * * * to regulate commerce with foreign nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes \u201d (clause 3) ; and in section 9 of the same article, which declares that \u201cNo preference shall be given by any regulation of commerce or revenue to the ports of one State over those of another; nor shall vessels bound to or from one State be obliged to enter, clear or pay duties in another \u201d (clause 6).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b511-9\">As to the first of these provisions, it is enough to say that the license tax in question is not a duty, an impost, or an excise, and is not, therefore, within that provision requiring uniformity throughout the United States. As to the last, (sec. 9, clause 6,) the license law for the District of Columbia gives no preference to the ports of any State, or even of the District, over those of any other State; and it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>is not easily conceived how that clause can be thought to have any relevancy to the subject in hand.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b512-3\">A question seems, however, to be presented by the remaining of the three clauses above enumerated, viz. I whether, as a regulation of commerce, the license law for the District is invalid, as obnoxious to the Constitution of the United States?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b512-4\">1. It is not doubted that the law regulates commerce, in the sense of the Constitution. The opinion of the Supreme Court of the United States in the recent case of Robbins <em>vs. </em>Taxing District of Shelby Co.,. 120 U, S.,489 ; S. C. 1 Interstate Com. Rep., 45, closes the door to any possible contention on that head.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b512-5\">\u25a0 2. It is equally certain that, as above pointed out, the law is, in effect, an enactment by Congress.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b512-6\">3. The question, then, becomes, has Congress power under the Constitution to pass such a law ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b512-7\">If not, it must be either because such power is not granted, or is denied, to Congress by the Constitution.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b512-8\">The power is undoubtedly granted in terms by article I, sec. &amp;, clause l1?, whereby Congress is given power to exercise exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever over the1 District of Columbia. As was said by Marshall, Oh. J., in Loughborough <em>vs, </em>Blake, 5 Wheat., 324. \u201c On the extent-of these terms, according to the common understanding of mankind, there- can be no difference of opinion.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b512-10\">But it is contended that this- broad grant is limited by the restrictions which the Constitution has imposed upon Congress. Granting this, what restriction of the Constitution upon the power of Congress affects-the- question under' consideration? Petitioner\u2019s counsel cite but two such restrictions as of supposed applicability \u2014 -that requiring uniformity of duties, imposts and excises, and that forbidding' preference to the ports-of one State over another; both of which have been noticed above.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b512-11\">What limitations, then, exist on the power of Congress-in regulating commerce ? Seemingly none, except those' distinctly prescribed by the Constitution, which \u201c are ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>pressed in plain terms,\u201d and none of which applies to the oase in hand.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b513-4\">The question thus occurs; Does the regulation of commerce complained of emanate from Congress ? That it \u25a0does is shown above, \u201c Although Congress cannot enable a State to legislate, Congress may adopt the provisions of a State on any given subject.\u201d <em>A fortiori </em>may it adopt the legislation of its own agency, in the exercise of one of its Undoubted powers. The adoption by Congress of any given legislation \u201c gives it the same validity as if its provisions had been specifically made by Congress.\u201d Gibbons <em>vs. </em>Ogden, 9 Weeat., 196, 207.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b513-5\">4. The recent decision of the Supreme Court of the United States (Robbins us. Taxing District, <em>supra), </em>in reality does not affect the question under consideration.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b513-6\">In that case it was held only that a given law of the State of Tennesse was invalid, as dealing with the sulyect of commerce, which, by the Constitution, was committed to Congress. The power of Congress, its extent and its limitations in the premises, were not under consideration.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b513-7\">5th. The petitioner has no right to complain of the District license law. He is not a member of a foreign nation, nor of an Indian tribe, and the law does not affect commerce \u201c among the Several States.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b513-8\">The District of Columbia is not a State, in the meaning of the Constitution, Hepburn <em>vs. </em>Ellzey, 2 Cranch, 445 ; New Orleans <em>vs. </em>Winter, 1 Wheat., 91; Scott us.

Hennick, certified to this court, from the criminal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">The petitioner, as it appears by his petition, was convicted before the police court upon an information against him as a commercial agent, or drummer, so-called. The information states :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-6\">\u201cThat on the 14th day of April, 1887, at the city of Washington he did engage in the business of a commercial agent, to wit: the business of offering for sale as agent of Lyons, Conklin &amp; Co., a firm doing business in the city of Baltimore, State of Maryland, certain goods, wares and merchandise, by sample, catalogue and otherwise, without having first obtained a license to dioso ; contrary to the provisions of an act of the legislative assembly.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">Prior to the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States' at its present term, in the case of Robbins <em>vs. </em>Taxing District of Shelby County, 120 U. S., 489 ; S. C. 1 Interstate Com. Rep., 45, there had been very great diversity of opinion throughout the United States as to the power of a State to tax commercial agents who were transacting business by selling goods by sample or by soliciting contracts for sale of goods owned by persons in other States than where the solicitation or sale was made. That diversity of opinion not only pervaded the legal profession, but, as it appears by this, recent decision of the supreme court, it still existed in that tribunal; so that there is a complete.justification for those who entertained that opinion, and who urged the liability under such laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-8\">By justification I mean justification up to the time that decision was pronounced. That decision being pronounced, however, it is obligatory upon all other tribunals and upon citizens of the United States.. It is not obligatory upon the supreme court itself, as a final adjudication, because it is liable to be reviewed by it and reversed by it if, in its better judgment hereafter, it should entertain a different opin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>ion from that which has been expressed by itself, because it is a well defined rule, announced by that court, that in constitutional questions the rule of <em>stare decisis </em>is not obligatory upon itself.' Constitutional questions are always open for revision by the supreme court itself, notwithstanding there there may have been one or more decisions upon the subject. But, while open for revision by that court such decisions, until reversed by it, are obligatory upon all other tribunals,-and demand implicit obedience from all citizens throughout this land.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\">In the case of Robbins <em>vs. </em>Shelby County it was decided that a state law imposing a tax upon commercial agents who solicited contracts for sale of property owned by citizens-of another State was beyond the power of the State to enact or enforce; that it was in contravention of the constitutional provision that Congress should have the exclusive power of regulating commerce between the States, a tax upon commercial agents or drummers of one State soliciting business within another State being a tax upon interstate commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">It was said in argument that that decision did not cover the whole proposition, that it was limited only to discriminations which were made by the Statute of Tennessee as against the citizens of other States, and that if the law had been equally as applicable to all travelers the decision would not cover it. But an inspection of that decision shows this to be a mistaken view of the subject. The court grasped the whole matter, discussed the whole matter fully, and decided the precise point as law, as will bo seen from the following quotation from the decision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-6\">\u201cButto tax the sale of such goods, or the offer to sell them, before they are brought into the State, is a very different thing, and seems to us clearly a tax-on interstate \u25a0commerce itself. It is strongly urged, as if it were a material point in the case, th$t no discrimination is made between domestic and foreign drummers, \u2014 those of Tennessee and those of other -States, \u2014 that are all taxed alike. But that does not meet the difficulty. Interstate commerce can<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>not be taxed at all, even though the same amount of tax should be laid on domestic commerce, or that which is carried on solely within the State. This was decided in the ease of State Freight Tax Cases, 15 Wall., 232. The negotiation of sales of goods which are in anothor State, for thepurpose of introducing them into the State in which the negotiation is made is interstate commerce. A New Orleans merchant cannot be taxed there for ordering goods from London or New York, because in the one case it is an act of foreign, and in the other of interstate commerce, both of which are subject to regulation.by Congress alone.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">Thus it will be seen that it does not put the decision at all upon the question of discrimination between drummers within the State and drummers outside the State; but it says that no law which imposes upon the person soliciting sales for merchants outside of the State is admissible, because that is a regulation of interstate commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">In connection with that decision it is well to read an extract from the opinion of the Supreme Court of the United States in the case of Walling v. Michigan, in 116 U. S., 456, which is as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-6\">\u201c The subjects indeed upon which Congress can act under this power are of infinite variety, requiring for their successful management different plans or modes of treatment. Some of them are national in their character, and admit and require uniformity of regulation, affecting alike all the States; others are local, or are mere aids to commerce, and can only be properly regulated by provisions adapted to their special circumstances and localities. Of the former class may be mentioned all that portion of commerce with foreign countries or between the States which consists in the transportation, purchase, sale and exchange of commodities. Here there can of necessity be only one system or plan of regulation, and that Congress alone can prescribe. Its nonaction in such cases, with respect to any particular commodity or mode of transportation, is a declaration of its purpose that the commerce in that commodity or by that means of transportation shall be free. There would others <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>wise be no security against conflicting regulations of different States, each discriminating in favor of its own products and citizens, and against the products and citizens of other States. And it is a matter of public history that the object of vesting in Congress the power to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the States was to insure uniformity of regulation against conflicting and discriminating State legislation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b517-4\">And further down on page 457 [695] it is said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-5\">\u201cAnd after an examination of the causes which led to the adoption of the Federal Constitution, one of the principal of which was the necessity for the regulation of commerce and the laying of imposts and duties by a single government, the court say: \u2018But whatever may be the motive for the tax, whether revenue, restriction, retaliation or protection of domestic manufactures, it is equally a regulation of commerce, and in effect an exercise of the power of laying duties on imports; and its exercise by the States is entirely at war with the spirit of the Constitution, and would render vain and nugatorj the power granted to Congress in relation to those subjects. Can any power more destructive to the union and harmony of the States be exercised than that of imposing discriminating taxes or duties on imports from other States P Whatever may be the motive for such taxes, they cannot fail to beget irritation and lead to retaliation ; and it is not difficult to foresee that an indulgence in such a course of legislation must inflame and produce a state of feeling that would seek its gratification in any measures regardless of the consequences/ <em>\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">Such is the declaration by the Supreme Court of the United States, of the spirit and scope of these constitutional provisions ; that they are necessary to the harmony and repose of the States; that they are necessary to the equal justice and equal privileges of the citizens of all the States of this Union; that they cannot be restricted at all; and that whatever rule is made with reference to them must be a uniform rule by the Congress of the United States acting as the National Legislature, regulating and controlling the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>commerce of the entire domain of the United States, with a view to do equal justice between all the parts of the country and to take away any possibility of prejudice or any suggestion of injustice or discrimination by one as against. another. That being so, it is manifest that any regulation upon this subject must be a regulation by Congress, in its capacity as the National Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">Now, could Congress, if it had been so disposed, have delegated to the legislative assembly of this District the power to pass any such law? That is not an open question in this court. In- the case of The District <em>vs. </em>Waggaman, 4 Mackey, 333, this court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-5\">\u201cIn Roach <em>vs. </em>Van Riswick, 7 Wash. Law Rep,, 496, this-court held that the very broad terms in which the organic-act of ISIO granted legislative powers to the legislative-assembly had the effect to clothe that body with only such powers as might be given to a municipal corporation, and that it was not competent for Congress to-delegate the larger powers- o-f general legislation which it had itself received from the Constitution.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">We have already shown by these extracts that this subject matter belongs to the larger power of general legislation \u2014 belongs to Congress as the legislature- of the Nation. It could not, therefore-, within- this-announcement, delegate-any such part of its general legislative power to a municipal legislative body. It is- altogether outside the- scope of a-municipal body to legislate on this subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">It would be marvelous indeed if, when the Constitution-strips all the States of this- Union of power to legislate on this subject, it could be pretended tha-t a municipal body could he clothed with any such faculty. If a State cannot do it, how can a body inferior to a- State do it? How can it be said to be within the power of a municipal corporation, when it is not within the power of a sovereign State, to legislate upon this subject matter? It would seem sufficient to stop at this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">But it has been said here in argument that the Congress of the United States- having the- exclusive legislative- power <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>of this District of Columbia, there is no restriction upon its capacity to act as such legislature. If the question were before the court in that aspect, it would not be difficult to say that it is a proposition that cannot be entertained by any who regard the comprehensive power of the Constitution, the object for which it was formed, or the purposes for which the District of Columbia was dedicated to national uses, to maintain that a body may be established here in legislative form, in antagonism to the rights of the various States of this Union.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\">This community is not even a State. It is an organized body to be legislated over by Congress alone. This District has surrendered its right of representation, and that representation is vested in Congress; but still it is vested in Congress as the National Legislature, and it is to be exercised by Congress in subordination to the principles of the Constitution of the United States. The argument, pushed to its extreme, would simply be this: Congress is without \u2022constitutional restraint as to this District; the people are helpless, and not under the sanctions or protection of the Constitution of the United States at all; the United States has here a foreign territory in which it can legislate in antagonism to the interests of the States and in opposition to the policy which prevails in the Constitution, obligatory \u25a0upon the States in their intercourse one with another to do equal and exact justice, one as to the other and each as to all. Such an argument cannot have any sanction at the hands of this court. This District is set aside and dedicated to the uses of the Nation, and if there be anywhere on the face of the earth a locality where no discrimination should he made as against the rights of any of the States or any \u2022citizens of the United States, it should be upon this soil where all are equal, on which each citizen has an equal right and in which each State has an equal right, as regards all the other States and as regards the United States itself. This territory is dedicated simply as a temple of justice, as a temple where the liberties of the Nation are to be sacredly preserved; and it is for that purpose that it should be ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>empt from hostile control or the possibility of antagonism with the purposes of the Union. Congress was vested with the power of exclusive legislation for this District, but not at all for the purpose of enabling it to legislate in any manner in hostility to the rights of any of the States of the Union.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">Can it be supposed for an instant that any of the States would have ceded to the Government of the United States a district for the seat of its government in which hostile legislation should be exercised towards the interests of the citizens of those States or the citizens of their sister States? We cannot suppose such a thing possible. We cannot suppose that when the Congress was vested with power to legislate over this District it was clothed with any' power to act as such legislature in hostility to the rights of the States or to do anything regarding the interests of the citizens of one State which any State of the Union could not do with regard to the citizens of any other State. We are subject to the Constitution of the United States. Here, if anywhere, the Constitution should be venerated, and the most sedulous regard should be had for each and all of its provisions, and we should rejoice that we are under its provisions ; we should rejoice that we are under its protection; we should rejoice that we are set apart for the purpose of ministering at the temple of justice, the temple of \u201cEquality of Laws \u201d which has been established in our midst.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">It seems impossible, therefore, to argue from the fact that Congress has exclusive legislation- over this District \u2014 that it has the power of the tyrant through this District over the States of the Union. The whole idea is inconsistent with the spirit of out institutions, utterly inconsistent with the- object for which the Constitution was formed, and for which this district of country was set apart for the uses of the general government. Therefore, even if Congress had undertaken, with regard to this District, in its general capacity as the legislature for the District, to pass such a law, it would have been outside the power of congress so to do; because,, as a National Legislature, it can only legislate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>under the commercial power upon the principle of uniformity, which is to pass laws equally operative upon any, every and all parts of the Union; and therefore any discrimination in favor of this community would be in violation of the spirit, if not the letter, of the Constitution of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">But we need not go that far for the purposes of this case. It was only necessary to speak of it for the purpose of repelling the argument, and making it be seen how we regard the relations of this community to the legislative power of Congress and to the several States of the Union. It is enough for the purposes of this cause to say that the delegated power to the legislative, assembly of this 'District was the delegation only of municipal power, and that any attempt to legislate in this respect is <em>ultra vires </em>a municipality as it is <em>ultra vires </em>the power of a State of this Union.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">For these reasons the court is of opinion that the prosecution was without authority; that so far as this law operates on this class of cases it is null and void, and that the prisoner must be discharged from custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">But it is necessary to add that this decision on this branch of the law is not at all inconsistent with the decision that was made in the Case of Waggaman, where it was held that the Legislative Assembly was empowered to impose a license tax upon people doing business within the District of Columbia. All occupations which are limited to the District of Columbia are subject to the taxing power. That is what was held in that case, and there is nothing in this case at all inconsistent with it. If this party had taken out a license for the District, for the purpose of soliciting business within the District, for sales by people within the District, he might have been subject, and would have been subject, to the license law. But upon the face of this information it appears affirmatively that his exclusive business was to act as the agent of citizens of \u25a0other States, soliciting contracts of sale for goods within those States, thereafter to be brought under the dominion, and within the control of the taxing power of the District. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>Therefore, there is no inconsistency between the two decisions. They are entirely harmonious, and there can be no difficulty in maintaining that in the aspect in which this case is presented, it is directly in the face of the decision in Bobbins <em>vs. </em>Shelby County, directly in opposition to the whole current of decisions upon the commercial power of the United States as expounded by the Supreme Court of the United States, and cannot be permitted to stand as law.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">Mr. Biddle: If I apprehend this decision correctly, it leaves the law to be enforced against the citizens of the District.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">Mr. Justice Merrick: Unquestionably.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">Mr. Biddle: The license law can be enforced against the citizens of the District <em>?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">Mr. Justice Merrick: Against citizens of the District who are soliciting sales for people within the District. But a citizen within the District who is employed as an agent of a citizen of another State, for the purpose of selling the goods of that citizen of the other State, cannot be restrained from so doing by the Legislative Assembly.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">Mr. Biddle: I quite apprehend that.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-9\">Mr. Justice Merrick: And further than that, I will say that if his business had heen to solicit business as a drummer of the District, and he had mingled with it the business of the people of a State, he would be obnoxious to the law, not for soliciting business for citizens of States, but as acting as a drummer generally. But here, the information says that he is charged with doing exclusively the business of a commercial agent, soliciting and selling his goods for citizens of other States. That is the exclusive business with which he is charged, and therefore it may well stand with the other matter about which the counsel has made the inquiry.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
