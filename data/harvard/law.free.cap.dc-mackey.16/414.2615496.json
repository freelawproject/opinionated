The defendant is a married woman, the wife of Leopold'Richold, and was such prior to the sale of goods to her by plaintiff, for which the notes sued on were given, and has always, since her marriage, cohabited with her husband. The defendant was, in August, 1882, carrying on the business of a retail dealer in boots and shoes, on her own account and with her separate estate in the District of Columbia. For the purpose of keeping up her stock and assortment of goods she began buying goods of the plaintiff in said month of August, 1882, and she bought goods of the plaintiff for her said store on'the following dates: August 19, 1882, October 30, 1882, November 1*7, 22 and 29, 1882, and December 1 and 9, 1882.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b431-7\">\u201cThe defendant paid for the boots and shoes bought prior to December 1, 1882, and gave the notes now sued on in promise of payment of the two bills bought on December 1, and 9, 1882. The goods so bought in December, 1882, were delivered to the defendant and used by her in said store in keeping up her stock and assortment, and were sold by her therein; and the said notes given for the same have not been paid and are still held by the plaintiff.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b431-8\">Then follows a\u2019copy of the notes sued upon.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b431-9\">The judgment of the court on these facts was entered for the defendant.

If not, then what investments are open to such an estate, and how can it be as if its owner were unmarried? It is the estate that is invested in a business that gives credit to the business ; and this is one of the elements of its value. If she could not \u201c size up \u201d her stock, a married woman using her separate estate in the business of a retail dealer could not well dispose of sizes already on hand, for she could not attract customers, and her trade would fail; and if she cannot obtain credit on the faith of her separate estate invested in such trade, then her right to it and power to dispose of it and to contract about it cannot be the same as if she were unmarried. She is limited and hampered as she would not be under section 727, R. S. D.

That case did not require a construction of this part of the statute, as the land was in New York, and our law was not applicable, so that it should not bQ considered as an authority binding on this court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b433-10\">Judge Wylie himself did not feel bound by that case, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>shown by his opinion in Harmon <em>vs. </em>Garland, a year after-wards. The defendant's right and title to the goods sold to her by the plaintiff in this case was absolute. These goods were bought long before the notes were given; were mingled with her previously acquired estate to enhance it; and were actually sold by the defendant, and the money received by her as the proceeds of her own property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b434-4\">It would require an iron rule, indeed, to compel a court of justice, in such a case, to give so narrow a construction to this statute as would allow a married woman, asserting the rights of a <em>feme sole, </em>to profit by such dealing at the expense of honest people.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b434-5\">We submit that the judgment of the circuit court should be reversed, and judgment entered for the plaintiff.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b434-6\">Leon Tobriner for defendant:</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b434-7\">The Married Woman's Act of this District gives no-power to married women to buy and sell as <em>feme sole </em>traders.

No new mode of acquisition is given her, no other right is bestoVed or liability imposed upon her but to \u201ccontract, sue or be sued <em>\u201d </em>in relation to an estate acquired in that manner.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b434-10\">The contract sued on in the case at bar arises out of an attempted acquisition, not in any of the modes contemplated by the statute. It is then sought to fix liability irpon a <em>feme covert </em>under a contract upon which she is not liable at common law, or under the statute in force in this District as construed by this court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b434-11\">In Stewart <em>vs. </em>Smith, 3 Mackey, 281, it was held that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>Contract by a married woman for the loan of money to carry on the business of a boarding house,-in which she is engaged, is not a contract relating to her separate estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b435-4\">\u201c Where a married woman, with her husband\u2019s consent, kept a restaurant and purchased groceries to enable her to carry on the business, held, not a contract relating to her separate estate.\u201d Conkling <em>vs. </em>Doul, 67 111-., 355.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b435-5\">Goods were sold and delivered to a married woman doing business in her own name and right, with her own separate estate and with the consent of her husband ; held, that she was not liable therefor.

Her earnings, the result of her personal efforts in the conduct of her business, would vest in the husband and be liable to the claims of his creditors; while her stock in trade, the corpus of her \u201c separate estate, would be protected as her <em>\u2018 </em>sole property.\u2019 \u201d Such an effect was never intended by Congress. A fair and reasonable construction was made by this court in Ritch <em>vs. </em>Hyatt, when it said: \u201cWe think the words of the statute have given no new rights to the married woman, in respect to the means of acquiring property. It makes a very complete settlement of all that she had, and all that she may acquire, to her sole and separate use, without conferring any new right of acquiring property in her own right. A married woman could always acquire property by gift, either by means of deed or will from others; and that faculty is preserved and made effectual by the statute.\u201d</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b436-6\">Mr. Justice James</author>\n<p id=\"AOD\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">The plaintiff claims that the shoes contracted for were, within the meaning of section 129 of the Revised Statutes, relating to the District, a matter having relation to the stock of shoes already owned by the defendant in her separate estate, because a stock of shoes is made up of assorted sizes in certain proportions, and is kept in a merchantable condition by such additions from time to time. A subtle assumption is involved in this proposition, namely, that the separate estate of the wife in this case consisted, not of mere articles of personal property, but of such property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>clothed in contemplation of law with peculiar qualities, because it is used by her as a sole trader. In short, the suggested relation between the articles contracted for and those already owned by her can be established only by showing that she is authorized by this statute to make any contract which may be necessary to the success of her business as a sole trader. Without this condition there can be no relation between the several lots of shoes.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">We think it has been settled by former decisions of this court that this section confers no such capacity. Ritch <em>vs. </em>Hyatt, 3 Mac A., 536, and Schneider <em>vs. </em>Garland, 1 Mackey, 350.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">It is next claimed that even if this contract does not fall within the meaning of section 729, as a contract in a matter having relation to her separate estate, the defendant nevertheless had power, under section 727, to acquire property by purchase, just as a <em>feme sole </em>may so acquire property ; and that, if she may acquire property by purchase, she may acquire it on the usual terms of purchase for a consideration, and therefore may bind herself to pay the consideration. The section referred to is in the following words: \u201cIn the District the right of a married woman to any property, personal or real, belonging to her at the time of the marriage, or acquired during marriage, <em>in any other way than by gift or a nveyance from her husband, </em>shall be as absolute as if she were unmarried,\u201d etc. It is claimed that these words recognize her capacity to acquire, and in part give her capacity to acquire property in any of the ways by which property is acquired, and that they consequently give her the power to make a contract to pay for it.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">This section does not pretend to regulate her <em>capacity to acquire </em>or her capacity to make contracts connected with, or with a view to acquisition. It deals simply with the completeness and absoluteness of her right to property acquired by her, in ways already known to the common law. In a word, it regulates her status as a proprietor, and not her power to make contracts. That subject is left wholly to, and is regulated exclusively by section 729. The fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>that this subject is taken up and disposed of in a separate clause or section excludes any implication that another section in any way affects the same matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">The consideration of hardship and fraud upon creditors is entitled to no weight. It is their duty to know the law relating to the capacity of married women, just as they must be held to know the law as to the capacities of infants. If they deal in ignorance, they must accept the consequences. Certainly it is not for us to add to or strain this statute. Our duty is simply to construe it.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b438-6\">Mr. Justice Mac Arthur dissented.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
