Sherman, </em>229 Mass. 240, 243. <em>Webber v. Sherman, </em>254 Mass. 402. And the defendant owed to a lodger or a tenant no duty to change the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>construction of the premises as they found them at the beginning of their occupancy. <em>Hannaford v. Kinne, </em>199 Mass. 63. <em>Stumpf v. Leland, </em>242 Mass. 168. <em>Caruso v. Lebowich, </em>251 Mass. 477. <em>Condon v. Winn, </em>252 Mass. 146. <em>Webber v. Sherman, </em>254 Mass. 402. <em>Carco v. Arch, Admx., </em>34 App. Div., 285, No. 263383.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-3\">Whether the plaintiff was a tenant of the defendant or a lodger of a tenant the obligation of the defendant to her was the same. <em>Pizzano v. Sherman, </em>229 Mass. 240, 242. <em>Caruso v. Lebowich, </em>251 Mass. 477. <em>Webber v. Sherman, </em>254 Mass. 402.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">The plaintiff, in urging the responsibility of the landlord, stresses the fact that the trial judge found the alleged defect to be unobvious, but we do not think that this alone is controlling in placing liability in this type of case.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">In <em>Webber v. Sherman, </em>254 Mass. 402, there was no evidence that the lodgers or their guest had ever observed the alleged defective condition prior to the time of the accident. Yet there was no recovery because the premises were in no different condition at the accident than at the time of the letting.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">As there was no evidence in the instant case that the condition of the premises was any different at the time of the accident than it was at the letting, and in the absence of evidence of concealed defects known only to landlord and not discoverable by the tenant, see <em>Minor v. Sharon, </em>112 Mass. 477, <em>Cutter v. Hamlen, </em>147 Mass. 471, at 474. the evidence did not warrant a verdict for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">This conclusion makes it unnecessary for us to deal with any of the requests other than the one we have treated.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">Judgment for the defendant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
