That on all the evidence the action is barred by the Statute of Limitations and the plaintiff cannot recover because the note was not signed in the presence of an attesting witness, and the action accrued more than six years before the commencement of the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-10\">2. That if the note was not signed in the presence of an attesting witness the plaintiff cannot recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-11\">3. That the action is barred under the Statute of Limitations if the note was not signed in the presence of an attesting witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-12\">4. That there is no evidence in the case on which the Court could find that the note in suit was signed in the presence of an attesting witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-13\">5. That the burden of showing that the note was signed in the presence of an attesting witness is on the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-14\">Requests numbered 1 and 4 were refused, number 5, allowed, and number 2 disposed in the following language:</p>\n<p id=\"b304-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>\u201cThe court construes this request, in view of the defendant\u2019s argument in this case, to mean that, if the defendant did not actually write his signature in the presence of the attesting witness, as distinguished from acknowledging his signature already written, the plaintiff cannot recover. Understood in this way, the request is refused.\u201d Number 3 is refused by applying the same construction to this request as to request number 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-3\">The simple issue to be determined is whether this note has been attested within the meaning of Gr. L. (Ter. Ed.) 0. 260, \u00a71, so that an action shall be brought on it within twenty years next after the cause of action accrued.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">In <em>Swazey v. Allen, </em>115 Mass. 594, it is quite appropri ately stated with particular force as it applies to the instant ease that, \u201cThe proposition to be established by the plaintiff is that the witness put his name to the note \u2018openly, and under circumstances which reasonably indicate that his signature is with the knowledge of the promisor, and is a part of the same transaction with the making of the note. \u2019 \u201d <em>Drury v. Vannevar, </em>1 Cush. 276. <em>Smith v. Dunham, </em>8 Pick. 246. <em>Phillips v. Vorenberg, </em>259 Mass. 46, 68.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">In <em>Parke v. Mears, 2 </em>Bos. <em>&amp; </em>Pul. 217, which is cited in <em>Smith v. Dunham, supra, </em>the witness Hearne was in the next room when the bond was executed and therefore did not see it signed and sealed. The defendant was present and heard the attorney ask Hearne to attest the bond. Hearne knew the defendant\u2019s handwriting, and the defendant had acknowledged the bond. His consent therefore to the attestation of Hearne was a necessary inference.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\"><em>Whitney v. Clary, </em>145 Mass. 156,157, is a case where the note in question was signed by the defendant and witnessed by one Groodell, who was in the adjoining room at the time of the maldng of the note and heard the conversation between the parties thereto as to the cause for giving the note, that she was called by her employer, the plaintiff\u2019s intes<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>tote to witness the note as the defendant was taking up the note of his son. She read the note and signed it. The court found that the note was duly signed by the defendant, attested by the witness, with the knowledge of the defendant and as a part of the same transaction with the making of the note. <em>Swazey v. Allen, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b305-3\">Loring, J. in <em>Nunn v. Ehlert, </em>218 Mass. 471, 474, stated that \u201cTo attest means to bear witness.\u201d Further citations sustaining the action of the trial court could be given by us, but we deem it unnecessary. The evidence warranted the finding made by the trial judge and there was no prejudicial error in the disposition of the defendant\u2019s requests for rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-9\">Report dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
