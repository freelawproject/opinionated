L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 84, \u00a720. Said notice was sent as registered mail.</p>\n<p id=\"AV2\">The following is a copy of the notice:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>\u201cTelephone: Mystic 6215 Residence: Mystic 5448-W</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-3\">WILLIAM E. FITZGERALD</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-4\">Attorney and Counsellor at Law 11 Riverside Avenue Medford, Mass.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-5\">April 11, 1934.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-6\">City of Somerville,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-7\">City Hall, Somerville, Mass.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-8\">Gentlemen:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-9\">This is to notify you that on Saturday March 31, 1934 at or about 6.45 P. M. while I was using the sidewalk on Derby Street, Somerville, I was injured seriously due to a defect consisting of a depression in the sidewalk in front of #50 Derby Street, in said Somerville, Mass.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-10\">Very truly yours,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-11\">(Signed) MELDON WELCH.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b463-12\">The \u201cReturn Receipt\u201d acknowledged the notice to have been received by the \u201cCity of Somerville (Signature of Addressee), M. E. Whittle (Signature of Addressee\u2019s Agent) Date of delivery 4/12/34.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b463-13\">The return of this receipt was sent to \u201cW. E. Fitzgerald 11 Riverside Avenue, Medford Branch, Boston, Mass.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AN1\">\u2022No \u201ccounter notice\u201d was sent by the defendant to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-14\">The following requests were filed by the plaintiff:</p>\n<p id=\"b463-15\">1. As a matter of law, the notice sent by registered mail to the defendant constitutes a proper legal notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-16\">2. As a matter of law, if there was any defect in said notice, the defendant was obliged by law to demand a different notice within five days from receipt of same.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-17\">3. As a matter of law, a depression in the sidewalk to a depth of six inches constitutes a defect within the meaning of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>4. As a matter of law, if the defendant allowed this condition to exist a few days before the accident this amounts to notice on the part of the defendant of the existence of said defect, and they should have remedied same.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-3\">5. The plaintiff proceeding along said sidewalk in the dark and stepping into depression, his foot catching the edge of the hole, cannot be said to be lacking in due care.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">6. As a matter of law the defendant was bound to keep the sidewalk in a safer condition than it was at the time of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">7. Allowing the sidewalk to remain in the defective condition, constructive notice can be said to be on the part of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">8. As a matter of law, the notice to the defendant is not misleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">The trial judge disposed of them in the following language, <em>i. e., </em>1. \u201cNotice by registered mail may or may not be prop\u00e9r; here in this ease, notice required not given as did not give place of residence. 2. Refused: in original notice no residence given, hence did not have to give 5 days notice. 3. Immaterial, because of rulings 1 and 2; 4 &amp; 5. Immaterial. 6. Given, but not material. 8. Not misleading, but not in compliance with Statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">There was a finding for the defendant on motion. The report contains all the evidence material to the issues involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-9\">The notice to the defendant indicates that it was sent by the plaintiff as it states that \u201c \u2018F (meaning the plaintiff) was using the sidewalk\u201d and \u201c \u2018F was injured seriously . . .\u201d and signed by the plaintiff \u201cMeldon Welch,\u201d though it was written on the letter head of the plaintiff\u2019s counsel. It does not appear in this notice that William E. Fitzgerald, Esq. was acting at the time as counsel or agent for the plaintiff or that he had authority from the plaintiff to send it. Nowhere on the \u201cReturn Receipt\u201d is the plaintiff\u2019s name or address given, nor is there a request <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>that the receipt be sent to him, or his agent or attorney or any one acting in his behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-3\">The statute states that . . . \u201cif the notice does not contain either the place of residence of the person injured, or the place of residence or business address of the person giving or serving the notice on behalf of the person so injured, such notice of insufficiency shall not be required, and the defendant may avail himself in defense of any omission or defect in the notice ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\">While the notice sent is written on the letter head of the Attorney for the plaintiff, it is signed by the plaintiff without his address and the defendant is unable therefore to send its \u201ccounter notice\u201d to the plaintiff and it does not appear by the notice that it was sent by the plaintiff\u2019s attorney as the latter\u2019s signature nowhere appears.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">Because the letter head of the Attorney for the plaintiff was used it does not follow that it was used with the authorization of the attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">It follows that the notice was not sent in accordance with the statute, <em>i. e., </em>Acts 1933, c. 114, \u00a73 and the defendant was not required to send the \u201ccounter notice\u201d of insufficiency and is within its rights in availing itself of such omission.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">No cases have been cited in the briefs by either of the parties in support of their contentions and our Supreme Court has not at the present writing been called upon to construe the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">There is no error shown in the trial court\u2019s disposition of the plaintiff\u2019s requests for rulings. It is unnecessary to discuss them and entry will be made of</p>\n<p id=\"b465-9\">Report dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
