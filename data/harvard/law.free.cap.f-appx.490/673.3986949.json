She appeals her sentence, arguing that the district court erred when it enhanced her sentence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.1(b)(7)(D) based on the deaths of two aliens.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>The sentencing court made exhaustive factual findings in support of its determination that the deaths were reasonably foreseeable. Specifically, the court found that all members of the conspiracy knew that the aliens were to be trekked on foot through the brush in the middle of summer. The trip was intended to take two or three days, which in itself presented danger, but it was foreseeable that they could be stranded in the brush for a longer period. Because the aliens were required to travel through the brush in \u201cextremely hot\u201d weather without sufficient food or water, the court further found it reasonably foreseeable that members of the party might go in search of help, find a rural road and collapse out of exhaustion, and be struck and killed by a motorist who did not see them.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">These findings are plausible in light of the record as a whole, and they certainly do not give rise to a \u201cfirm and definite conviction\u201d that the sentencing court was mistaken. See <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>630 F.3d 377, 380 (5th Cir.2011); <em>United States v. De Jesus-Ojeda, </em>515 F.3d 434, 442 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b699-9\"><em> </em>Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
