Callihan concedes that in tax year 2007, he resided in Florida and that he worked for the School District of DeSoto County in exchange for $37,640, as well as the Sarasota Family YMCA, Inc. in exchange for $616. He insists, however, that none of his work constituted \u201cemployment\u201d within the meaning of section 3121(b) of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC), 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 3121(b), and thus, the money he received in compensation for the services he rendered is not taxable.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-9\">Callihan acknowledges that section 3121(b) defines \u201cemployment\u201d as \u201cany service ... performed ... by an employee ... within the United States.\u201d <em>Id. </em>But he notes that the section defines the term \u201cState[s]\u201d as \u201cinclud[ing] the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, and American Samoa,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3121(e)(1), and that the term \u201cUnited States\u201d is similarly defined as \u201cincludfing]\u201d some of these territories, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3121(e)(2). According to Callihan, because these definitions do not specifically mention the fifty states, the work that he did in Florida did not constitute \u201cemployment\u201d under section 3121(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-12\">The Tax Court rejected this argument as \u201cthoroughly discredited and frivolous,\u201d and we are compelled to agree. Our precedent makes it abundantly clear that the term \u201cUnited States\u201d in the IRC is not limited to the District of Columbia and the territories and possessions of the United States. <em>See United States v. Ward, </em>833 F.2d 1538, 1539 (11th Cir.1987) (rejecting the argument as \u201cutterly without merit\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Bennett, </em>448 Fed. Appx. 991, 992 (11th Cir.2011); <em>United States v. Morgan, </em>419 Fed.Appx. 958, 959 (11th Cir.2011). The Tax Court thus correctly dismissed Callihan\u2019s assertion that Florida is not part of the \u201cUnited States,\u201d and its judgment must therefore be affirmed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b354-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b354-10\">. The IRS's tax deficiency determination also rested in part on Callihan's receipt of a $475 grant from the State of Florida in 2007. Although Callihan appears to challenge the Tax Court's conclusion that this was taxable, the only argument he makes here concerns the scope of the term \"United States\u201d in the definition of \"employment.\u201d We therefore understand Callihan's argument to be that the grant was not taxable because he received it in Florida. This suggestion also fails for the reason stated above.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
