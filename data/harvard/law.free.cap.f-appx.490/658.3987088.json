The district court granted the Defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the claim of retaliatory discharge and granted the Defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the claim of employment discrimination. Winslow-Harris appeals the judgment on both claims. We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">On her first claim of retaliatory discharge, the district court held that Win-slow-Harris had not exhausted her administrative remedies. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-16(c). Thus, the district court properly dismissed this claim under Fed. R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1) for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. <em>Pacheco v. Mineta, </em>448 F.3d 783, 788 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">Winslow-Harris\u2019s second claim of discrimination based on her race is analyzed using the traditional burden-shifting rules of <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973). A plaintiff must first establish a <em>prima facie </em>case that she has suffered discrimination based on race. <em>Frank v. Xerox Corp., </em>347 F.3d 130, 137 (5th Cir. 2003). If that case is made, the burden shifts to the defendant to \u201carticulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the questioned employment action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If such a reason is given, \u201cthe burden shifts back to the plaintiff to produce evidence that the defendant\u2019s articulated reason is merely a pretext for discrimination.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">Assuming Winslow-Harris established her <em>prima facie </em>case, the Defendant articulated legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for discharging Winslow-Harris during her probationary period of employment. Winslow-Harris filed no opposition to the Defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The record contains no evidence that the Defendant\u2019s stated reasons are pretextual. \u201c \u2018A complete failure of proof concerning an essential element of the nonmoving party\u2019s case necessarily renders all other facts immaterial\u2019 and \u2018mandates the entry of summary judgment\u2019 for the moving party.\u201d <em>United States ex rel. Farmer v. City of Houston, </em>523 F.3d 333, 337 (5th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 322-23, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986)). The claim based on racial discrimination fails because there was no evidence produced suggesting pretext.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-9\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b684-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
