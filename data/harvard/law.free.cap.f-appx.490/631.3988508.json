The district court referred the matter to a magistrate judge who reviewed and examined Plaintiff-Appellant\u2019s complaint and related filings in considerable detail and recommended that the complaint be summarily dismissed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2). The district court reviewed the findings, conclusions, and recommendations of the magistrate judge and the Plaintiff-Appellant\u2019s objection thereto, then overruled that objection, accepted the findings, conclusions, and recommendations of the magistrate judge, denied a motion to compel by Plaintiff-Appellant, and ordered that her complaint be summarily dismissed pursuant to \u00a7 1915(e)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">We have reviewed the report of the magistrate judge, the rulings of the district court, the filings of the Plaintiff-Appellant, and the remainder of the record. Although we understand and sympathize with the obvious frustration of Plaintiff-Appellant, we are convinced that the rulings of the district court in this case are correct. Accordingly, its judgment of April 11, 2012 must be, in all respects,</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b657-37\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
