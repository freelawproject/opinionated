Petitioners now seek this court\u2019s review<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of the asylum and withholding of removal rulings.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b293-16\">The Attorney General or Secretary of Homeland Security has discretion to grant asylum if the alien meets the definition of \u201crefugee,\u201d as defined by INA \u00a7 101(a)(42)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). INA \u00a7 208(b)(1)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(A). A refugee is defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AE\">any person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality ... who is unable or unwilling to return to ... that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-18\">INA \u00a7 101(a)(42)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). Eligibility for withholding of removal and asylum is established if the petitioner can show that persecution was, at least in part, motivated by a protected ground. <em>Rivera v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>487 F.3d 815, 820-21 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-20\">We defer to the BIA\u2019s <em>Acosta </em>formulation of a \u201cparticular social group\u201d (\u201cPSG\u201d). <em>Castillo-Arias, </em>446 F.3d at 1196; <em>Matter of Acosta, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 211, 233 (BIA 1985), <em>overruled on other grounds by Matter of Mogharrabi, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 439 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>(BIA 1987). Under <em>Acosta, </em>persecution on account of membership in a PSG means \u201cpersecution that is directed toward an individual who is a member of a group of persons all of whom share a common, immutable characteristic ... such as sex, color, or kinship ties, or in some circumstances it might be a shared past experience, such as former military leadership or land ownership.\u201d <em>Acosta, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 233. This common characteristic must be something other than the risk of being persecuted. <em>See Castillo-Arias, </em>446 F.3d at 1193-94, 1199.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">Further, the social visibility of the members of a particular group is to be considered in determining whether that PSG is afforded protection under the INA. <em>See id. </em>at 1197. Particular social groups are not a catch-all for persons alleging persecution, but who do not fit into other protected groups. <em>Id. </em>at 1198. A purported social group lacks particularity if it makes up a potentially large and diffuse segment of society. <em>See Matter of S-E-G-, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 579, 585 (BIA 2008); <em>Castillo-Arias, </em>446 F.3d at 1198.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">Petitioners\u2019 claims for asylum is based on the fact that the petitioning daughters were raped on four separate occasions by members of the Mara 18 gang the petitioning refused to transport drugs for them and threw them out of his taxicab for smoking drugs in the cab. The IJ and BIA held that the group Petitioners claim membership in does not constitute a PSG within the meaning of the INA. Petitioners disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">In their brief, Petitioners say that their group consists of those who suffer persecution based on their gender, that the Mara 18 gang was \u201cenforcing their collection of money to fund their organization by committing the most heinous crime that can be committed on a female,\u201d rape. Petitioners\u2019 br. At 25. \u201cFrom the beginning,\u201d the gang warned that if their demands were not met, \u201cthey were going to harm [the] daughters and these threats were ultimately carried out.\u201d <em>Id. </em>According to Petitioners, families in El Salvador facing such persecution are a PSG under <em>Acosta. </em>We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"AC\">According to <em>Acosta, </em>a PSG consists of \u201ca group of persons all of whom share a common, immutable characteristic ... such as sex, color, or kinship ties, or in some circumstances it might be a shared past experience.\u201d Petitioners\u2019s purported PSG must be read as families in El Salvador with daughters, not as families with daughters who were raped as Petitioners imply.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This group is overly broad and does not have the particularity necessary to constitute a PSG. Since Petitioners\u2019s group is not a PSG, they failed to establish persecution based on a protected ground and were not eligible for asylum or withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-11\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b293-13\">. Petitioners are Luz Marina Urias De Velasquez, her husband, Mario Velasquez Cisneros, and their two teenage daughters, Katherine Velasquez Urias and Josellinne Urias Chinchilla.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b293-14\">. We review the BIA's decision as the final judgment, unless the BIA has expressly adopted the IJ's decision. <em>Ruiz v. Gonzales, </em>479 F.3d 762, 765 (11th Cir.2007). Here, because the BIA did not expressly adopt the IJ\u2019s decision, we review the BIA's decision only. To the extent that the BIA\u2019s decision was based on a legal determination, we review the decision <em>de novo. Castillo-Arias v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>446 F.3d 1190, 1195 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b293-22\">.Petitioners do not argue in their brief to this court that the BIA erred in denying CAT relief. Thus, their claim to such relief is abandoned. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b294-7\">. Petitioner Mario Velasquez Cisneros, the father, was not subjected to the gang\u2019s demands because he had two daughters, he was subjected to the demands because he possessed a vehicle that could be used to transport the gang\u2019s drugs.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
