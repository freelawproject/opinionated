In March of 2011, the district court sentenced him to 120 months of imprisonment, the mandatory minimum in effect at the time of Heard\u2019s offense conduct, and five years of supervised release. The district court rejected Heard\u2019s argument that the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 (FSA) should apply retroactively to him. Heard appeals that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>We held this matter in abeyance pending the outcome of <em>Dorsey v. United, States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 132 S.Ct. 2321, 183 L.Ed.2d 250 (2012). In light of <em>Dorsey\u2019s </em>holding that the FSA applies retroactively to those whose conduct occurred before the FSA\u2019s effective date of August 3, 2010, but who were sentenced after that date, we VACATE Heard\u2019s sentence and REMAND this case for resentencing consistent with <em>Dorsey.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b696-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
