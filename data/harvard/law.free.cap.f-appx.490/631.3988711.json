As Sun does not challenge the BIA\u2019s ruling that the motion to reopen was untimely filed, he has waived this issue. <em>See Soad-jede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 833 (5th Cir.2003); <em>see also Calderon-Ontiveros v. I.N.S., </em>809 F.2d 1050, 1052 (5th Cir.1986). And, as this issue is dispositive, we do not address Sun\u2019s challenge of the BIA\u2019s alternative reason for denying his motion to reopen, viz., his ineligibility for adjustment of status.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-22\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b657-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
