He argues that the district court clearly erred in applying the two-level enhancement for possession of a firearm under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">\u201cThe district court\u2019s determination that \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) applies is a factual finding reviewed for clear error.\u201d <em>See United States v. Ruiz, </em>621 F.3d 390, 396 (5th Cir.2010). A factual finding is not clearly erroneous if it is plausible in light of the record as a whole. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b673-8\">Our review of the record does not show that a connection between the handguns and Reyes\u2019s drug-related offense was \u201cclearly improbable.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 2D1.1, comment. (n. 3). To the contrary, this review shows \u201cthat a temporal and spatial relation existed between the weapon, the drug trafficking activity, and the defendant.\u201d <em>See United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764-65 (5th Cir.2008). Both the loaded handguns and the drugs were discovered in Reyes\u2019s home. The loaded handguns were discovered under the mattress in the bedroom where Reyes slept, and the drugs were discovered in a back bedroom. Moreover, Reyes pleaded guilty to possession with intent to distribute the marijuana seized from in the back bedroom, and Reyes\u2019s brother told agents that Reyes coordinated the transportation of the marijuana found at his home. The district court did not clearly err by imposing the two-level enhancement. <em>See Ruiz, </em>621 F.3d at 396.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-10\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b673-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
