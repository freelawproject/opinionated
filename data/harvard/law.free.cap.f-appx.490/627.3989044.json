Reyes-Cuellar argues that the district court clearly erred in applying a two-level adjustment for possession of a dangerous weapon. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l). He contends that there was insufficient evidence to show that the firearms recovered from the stash house were possessed in connection with the offense or that he should have reasonably foreseen that a dangerous weapon would be possessed. Reyes-Cuellar further contends that the district court failed to make proper findings to support the application of the enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-12\">This court generally reviews a district court\u2019s interpretation or application of the Guidelines de novo and its factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Cisne-ros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir. 2008). \u201cThere is no clear error if the district court\u2019s finding is plausible in light of the record as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-13\">Section 2D1.1 should be applied \u201cif the weapon was present, unless it is clearly improbable that the weapon was connected with the offense.\u201d \u00a7 2D1.1, comment. (n.3). A defendant may be held responsible for \u201call reasonably foreseeable acts\u201d of others taken in furtherance of ... jointly under criminal activity.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l)(B); <em>see also United States v. Mergerson, </em>4 F.3d 337, 350 (5th Cir. 1993). There is ample evidence that Reyes-Cuellar and his coconspirator were jointly engaged in the crime of possession with intent to distribute a large amount of cocaine. It was thus reasonably foreseeable that the coconspirator would possess a dangerous weapon at a stash house known to be \u201cutilized to store large quantities of narcotics.\u201d <em>See United States v. Thomas, </em>120 F.3d 564, 574 (5th Cir.1997); <em>Mergerson, </em>4 F.3d at 350. The record reflects that the district court considered the arguments presented by Reyes-Cuel-lar and adopted the presentence report\u2019s facts regarding the dangerous weapon enhancement. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>602 F.3d 346, 363 (5th Cir.2010); <em>United States v. Huerta, </em>182 F.3d 361, 364 (5th Cir.1999). Reyes-Cuellar has failed to show that the district court clearly erred in applying the firearm enhancement to his sentence. <em>See Cisne-ros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d at 764. The judgment of the district court is therefore AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b654-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
