The district court denied his IFP motion and certified that the appeal was not taken in good faith. By moving for IFP status, Flores is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>challenging the district court\u2019s certification. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">Aside from conclusional allegations that he is challenging the district court\u2019s determination that the appeal was not taken in good faith, that his \u00a7 1983 case has merit, and that prison employees were and continue to be deliberately indifferent to his serious medical condition, Flores does not address the district court\u2019s reasons for its certification decision. Flores\u2019s challenge to the district court\u2019s certification decision is therefore abandoned. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">Flores has not shown that the district court\u2019s certification was incorrect. The instant appeal is without arguable merit and is thus frivolous. Accordingly, Flores\u2019s IFP motion is denied, and his appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of Flores\u2019s complaint as frivolous and the dismissal of the instant appeal as frivolous count as strikes under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Flores is cautioned that if he accumulates three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g), he will not be able to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-8\">MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b688-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
