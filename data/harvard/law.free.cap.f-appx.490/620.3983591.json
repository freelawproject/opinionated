Newson, </em>515 F.3d 874, 377-78 (5th Cir.2008), which held that the Government may decline to move for an additional one-point reduction under United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 3El.l(b) based on the defendant\u2019s refusal to waive his right to appeal. Gutierrez-Rodriguez further concedes that his remaining arguments are foreclosed as this court has repeatedly held that a sentencing judge may find by a preponderance of the evidence all the facts necessary to the determination of a sentencing guidelines range. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Rhine, </em>583 F.3d 878, 891 (5th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Stevens, </em>487 F.3d 232, 246 (5th Cir.2007); <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 793, 798 (5th Cir.2006). The Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED, the Government\u2019s alternative motion for an extension of time to file a brief is DENIED, and the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b646-36\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
