Brooker contends that his sentence, an upward departure or variance from the advisory sentencing guidelines range of 24 to 30 months, was substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-16\">Following <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), our review of sentences is for reasonableness in light of the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 518-19 (5th Cir.2005). When the district court has imposed a sentence that varies from the guidelines range, reasonableness review requires that we evaluate whether the sentence \u201cunreasonably fails to reflect the statutory sentencing factors\u201d set forth in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 708 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-21\">The record indicates that the district court properly considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The 63-month sentence reflected the seriousness of Brooker\u2019s offense, the need to promote respect for the law, the need to provide just punishment, and the need to protect the public from future crimes. The sentence imposed was reasonable \u201cunder the totality of the relevant statutory factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Jones, </em>444 F.3d 430, 441 (5th Cir.2006). Brook-er\u2019s disagreement with the sentence and the district court\u2019s weighing of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors is insufficient to show the court abused its discretion. <em>See United States v. Lopez-Velasquez, </em>526 F.3d 804, 807 (5th Cir.2008). Along that line, the sentence was 33 months above the top of the advisory guidelines sentencing range. Our court has upheld variances considerably greater than the increase to Brooker\u2019s sentence. <em>E.g., United States v. Brantley, </em>537 F.3d 347, 349-50 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Smith, </em>417 F.3d 483, 492-93 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b704-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
