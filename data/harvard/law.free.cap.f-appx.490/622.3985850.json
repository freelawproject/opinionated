Because the BIA relied upon the IJ\u2019s decision, both it and the BIA\u2019s order are reviewed for substantial evidence. <em>E.g., Wang v. Holder, </em>569 F.3d 531, 536 (5th Cir .2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">Concerning asylum, there is no need to resolve whether the BIA erred in holding Hassnain failed to raise before the IJ, and thus waived, several of his contentions that either changed or extraordinary circumstances excused his failure to timely file his asylum application. The BIA\u2019s alternative, substantive holding that Hassnain failed to show such circumstances was based upon its assessment of the facts and circumstances of the case; therefore, we lack jurisdiction to review the dismissal of Hassnain\u2019s asylum claim. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B), (D); <em>Zhu v. Gonzales, </em>493 F.3d 588, 594-96 &amp; n. 31 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">Similarly, because he did not raise it before the BIA, we lack jurisdiction to consider Hassnain\u2019s withholding-of-removal claim based upon a \u201cpattern or practice of persecution of a group of persons similarly situated\u201d to him. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(b)(2)(i)-(ii); <em>Said v. Gonzales, </em>488 F.3d 668, 670-71 (5th Cir.2007) (no jurisdiction to consider claims not exhausted before the BIA).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">For Hassnain\u2019s claim that he will be singled out for persecution for his individual characteristics, <em>inter alia, </em>his extended residency in the United States, Ismaili religion, and status as an Aga Khan follower and scholarship recipient, he does not identify substantial evidence in the record compelling the conclusion that the BIA or IJ erred in holding he did not show he will more likely than not be persecuted on these bases if removed to Pakistan. <em>Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 339, 344 (5th Cir.2005); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1208.16(b)(2). Similarly, Hass-nain fails to identify substantial evidence in the record compelling the conclusion he was wrongly denied CAT relief. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(e)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-11\">DISMISSED in part; DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b648-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
