For the reasons discussed below, we VACATE the EPA\u2019s disapproval of the regulation and REMAND to the EPA for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-20\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b683-21\">In 2011, the Environmental Protection Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d or \u201cthe Agency\u201d) issued a final rule partially approving and partially disapproving revisions of the Texas State Implementation Plan (\u201cSIP\u201d) \u2014 a set of rules promulgated by the State of Texas in fulfillment of its obligations under the Clean Air Act. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7410; Approval and Promulgation of Air Quality Implementation Plans, 76 Fed.Reg. 1525 (Jan. 11, 2011) (to be codified at 40 C.F.R. pt. 52). At issue here is the Agency\u2019s disapproval of a provision within the SIP, 30 Tex. Admin. Code \u00a7 116.911(a)(2), which requires owners and operators of certain electric generating facilities to demonstrate that any newly proposed pollution control methods comply with Texas\u2019s Standard Permit for Pollution Control Projects (\u201cPCP\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Petitioners argue that the EPA had no legal basis for disapproving section 116.911(a)(2), and that the EPA\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>actions therefore must be held \u201cunlawful and set aside.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">The EPA\u2019s sole recorded basis for disapproving section 116.911(a)(2) was that, in a prior ruling, the Agency had disapproved Texas\u2019s Standard Permit for PCPs. <em>See </em>76 Fed.Reg. at 1527. In other words, the EPA disapproved section 116.911(a)(2) merely because that section mandated compliance with Texas\u2019s Standard Permit for PCPs, which the EPA had already disapproved. <em>See id. </em>(\u201c[W]e are disapproving the submitted 116.911(a)(2) because it refers to and relies on the PCP [Standard Permit] that does not meet the applicable requirements of the [Clean Air] Act, and was previously disapproved by the EPA as a part of the Texas SIP.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">In <em>Luminant Generation Co., L.L.C. v. EPA (Luminant I), </em>675 F.3d 917, 921 (5th Cir.2012), this court held that \u201cthe EPA had no legal basis on which to disapprove\u201d Texas\u2019s Standard Permit for PCPs and, accordingly, vacated the EPA\u2019s ruling on that issue. The EPA has now informed the court that, having had an opportunity to review <em>Luminant I </em>and the record in this case, the EPA cannot reconcile its disapproval of section 116.911(a)(2) with this court\u2019s holding in <em>Luminant I. </em>The Agency concedes, then, that its disapproval of section 116.911(a)(2) was \u201cnot in accordance with law\u201d and therefore must be vacated. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A). We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b684-8\">Accordingly, we VACATE the EPA\u2019s disapproval of section 116.911(a)(2) and REMAND for further proceedings consistent with this opinion and <em>Luminant I.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b683-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Circuit Rule 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Circuit Rule 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b683-15\">. Only the EPA's disapproval of 30 Tex. Admin. Code \u00a7 116.911(a)(2) is currently before the court. In a prior, related case, this court addressed other EPA actions pertaining to Texas\u2019s SIP. <em>See Luminant Generation Co., L.L.C. </em>v. <em>EPA (Luminant I), </em>675 F.3d 917 (5th Cir.2012). Because <em>Luminant I </em>thoroughly outlined the statutory and factual background related to Texas's SIP and Standard Permit for PCPs, and because the parties are familiar with the issues in this case, those details are not repeated here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b684-9\">. Given the court\u2019s disposition of this matter, the petitioners\u2019 motion for summary vacatur and remand, and the EPA\u2019s cross-motion to remand without vacatur \u2014 which were carried with the case \u2014 are DENIED as moot.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
