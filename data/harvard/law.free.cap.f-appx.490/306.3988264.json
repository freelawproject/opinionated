On appeal, Appellants do not address the reasons for the district court\u2019s dismissal of their complaint. Instead, Appellants argue that CitiMort-gage lacked standing to initiate foreclosure proceedings, and that the district court erred by refusing to enter a default judgment against Century Mortgage Corp. (Century).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-21\">Appellants\u2019 complaint did not allege any facts to support their argument that Citi-Mortgage lacked standing to start the foreclosure proceedings. Their conclusory allegations were insufficient to state a claim. <em>See Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 678-79, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009). As for Appellants\u2019 other claims, Appellants have abandoned them by failing to address them in their opening brief. <em>See Greenbriar, Ltd. v. City of Alabaster, </em>881 <em>F.2d </em>1570, 1573 n. 6 (11th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-22\">We review for abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for default judgment. <em>Mitchell v. Brown &amp; William</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number><em>son Tobacco Corp., </em>294 F.3d 1309, 1316 (11th Cir.2002). A party\u2019s default does not by itself warrant the entry of a default judgment unless there is \u201ca sufficient basis in the pleadings for the judgment entered.\u201d <em>Nishimatsu Constr. Co. v. Hous. Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>515 F.2d 1200, 1206 (5th Cir. 1975).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Century\u2019s failure to answer the complaint did not require the district court to enter a default judgment because Appellants\u2019 complaint failed to provide a proper basis for judgment against Century. Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion when it refused to enter a default judgment against Century.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b333-15\">.
