Ells-worth argues that the district court improperly considered the factor of punishment in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) as a basis for imposing a sentence substantially higher than the policy statement required. He asserts that the district court indicated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>that it was issuing a sentence based in part upon punishment, which improper consideration likely exerted upward pressure on the sentence. Ellsworth states that the district court \u201cmeant it was punishing him for his technical violations of supervised release, a factor plainly forbidden by this Court to consider.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">We review a sentence imposed on revocation of supervised release to determine if it is \u201cplainly unreasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Miller, </em>634 F.3d 841, 843 (5th Cir.2011). In <em>Miller, </em>we held that it is improper for a district court to rely on \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A), which permits a sentencing court to consider the need for the sentence \u201cto reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense,\u201d when modifying or revoking a term of supervised release. <em>Miller, </em>634 F.3d at 844.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">In response to Ellsworth\u2019s objection, the district court clarified the context in which it used the term \u201cpunishment,\u201d meaning punishment for violating the terms of his supervised release. As the Government correctly notes, \u201cthe goal of revocation is to punish a defendant for violating the terms of the supervised release.\u201d <em>Miller, </em>634 F.3d at 843. The district court\u2019s reference to punishment did not amount to an improper consideration of the just punishment factor of \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) that we held was improper in <em>Miller.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">Further, Ellsworth\u2019s supervised release was revoked under \u00a7 3583(e) and (g), because one of the violations to which he pleaded true was failure to comply with the drug testing requirement, a mandatory revocation violation under \u00a7 3583(g)(3). Section 3583(g) does not expressly invoke the sentencing factors of \u00a7 3553(a) or the limits imposed by the first clause of \u00a7 3583(e). <em>See </em>\u00a7 3583(g); <em>United States v. Giddings, </em>37 F.3d 1091, 1095 (5th Cir. 1994) (noting that a court need not consider \u00a7 3553(a) when revocation is mandated by \u00a7 3583(g)). Ellsworth has not shown that the district court procedurally erred because when revocation of supervised release is mandatory under \u00a7 3583(g), the factors a sentencing court may consider is not limited by \u00a7 3583(e). <em>See United States v. Larison, </em>432 F.3d 921, 923 n. 3 (8th Cir.2006); <em>cf. United States v. Holmes, </em>473 Fed.Appx. 400, 401 (5th Cir. 2012) (reviewing for plain error); <em>United States v. Ibanez, </em>454 Fed.Appx. 328, 330 (5th Cir.2011) (same), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 132 S.Ct. 1981, 182 L.Ed.2d 828 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-10\">The judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"AJS\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b689-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
