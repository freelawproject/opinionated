Bunn now moves for leave to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) on appeal following the denial of his motion for a reduction of sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 8582(c)(2). By so moving, Bunn challenges the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal was not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). This court\u2019s inquiry into a litigant\u2019s good faith \u201cis limited to whether the appeal involves legal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-10\">Bunn challenges the district court\u2019s determination that he was ineligible for relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) because his sentence ultimately rested on the career offender provision of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 rather than \u00a7 2D1.1. He also argues that although the courts ordinarily have denied \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief for career offenders, some courts have granted such relief in cases where the original sentence represented a departure or variance from the guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-11\">\u201cThe crack cocaine guideline amendments do not apply to prisoners sentenced as career offenders.\u201d <em>United States v. Anderson, </em>591 F.3d 789, 791 (5th Cir. 2009); <em>see also United States v. Webb, </em>425 Fed.Appx. 406, 407 (5th Cir.2011) (relying on <em>Anderson </em>to affirm the denial of. a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion under Amendment 750 where the appellant was sentenced as a career offender). Moreover, the district court imposed a sentence within the guidelines range; it did not depart or vary from that range. Accordingly, Bunn\u2019s reliance on the nonbinding cases from other courts is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-16\">Bunn has failed to demonstrate a non-frivolous issue for appeal. Accordingly, his motion for leave to proceed IFP is denied, and the appeal is dismissed as frivolous. See <em>Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24; 5th CiR. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-17\">IFP MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b653-12\"><em> </em>Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
