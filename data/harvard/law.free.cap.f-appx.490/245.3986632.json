The jury acquitted her of the conspiracy and mail fraud charges but convicted her of aggravated identity theft. On appeal, Dew argues that a conviction of a predicate felony is a necessary element of aggravated identity theft under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028A(a)(l). She contends that her conviction cannot stand because she has not been convicted of mail fraud or any other predicate felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-24\">The inconsistency in the jury verdict is not problematic.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-25\">[Ijnconsistent verdicts \u2014 even verdicts that acquit on a predicate offense while convicting on the compound offense\u2014 should not necessarily be interpreted as a windfall to the Government at the defendant\u2019s expense. It is equally possible that the jury, convinced of guilt, properly reached its conclusion on the compound offense, and then through <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>mistake, compromise, or lenity, arrived at an inconsistent conclusion on the lesser offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b272-4\"><em>United States v. Powell, </em>469 U.S. 57, 64, 105 S.Ct. 471, 476, 88 L.Ed.2d 461 (1984). Here, it is equally possible that the jury, through mistake, compromise or lenity, arrived at the wrong verdict as to the charge of mail fraud and not the charge of aggravated identity theft. Dew does not argue that the evidence presented at trial was otherwise insufficient. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
