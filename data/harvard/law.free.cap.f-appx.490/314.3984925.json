Bookman appeals the district court\u2019s grant of attorney\u2019s fees and costs, which it awarded after her successful application for disability benefits. She contends that the district court abused its discretion by not granting her request for additional attorney\u2019s fees under 42 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>\u00a7 406(b) and by awarding her only $2,875 in attorney\u2019s fees and $350 in costs under the Equal Access to Justice Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">Bookman filed a complaint in federal district court challenging the Social Security Administration\u2019s denial of her application for disability benefits. After a remand, the SSA awarded Bookman disability benefits, including past-due benefits of $20,148, and it set aside 25% of those past-due benefits for Bookman\u2019s attorney under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 406(a). The district court affirmed the SSA\u2019s decision, and Bookman filed a motion for additional attorney\u2019s fees and costs under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 406(b) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">A magistrate judge issued a report recommending the district court grant Book-man\u2019s motion in part and deny it in part. The report concluded that the number of hours Bookman\u2019s attorney billed and the rate he charged were both excessive. It recommended that the United States be taxed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412 for Book-man\u2019s costs of $350 and her attorney\u2019s fees in the amount of $2,875-23 hours at $125 per hour of $350. The district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation over Bookman\u2019s objections, but it did not consider her request for attorney\u2019s fees under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 406(b). Bookman appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-8\">We review only for an abuse of discretion the district court\u2019s resolution of a motion for attorney\u2019s fees and costs. <em>See Friends of the Everglades v. S. Fla. Water Mgmt. Dist., </em>678 F.3d 1199, 1201 (11th Cir.2012). We may affirm on any basis supported by the record, even if the district court did not rely upon it. <em>Cochran v. U.S. Health Care Fin. Admin., </em>291 F.3d 775, 778 n. 3 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-12\">Bookman contends the district court abused its discretion by not considering her \u00a7 406(b) request for attorney\u2019s fees. If a party filing for disability benefits receives a favorable determination before the SSA, the Commissioner is required to fix a reasonable fee to compensate her attorney, but that award may not exceed 25% of the claimant\u2019s past-due benefits. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 406(a). Similarly, if a party filing for disability benefits receives a favorable judgment from a court, the court may fix a reasonable fee to compensate her attorney, but that award also may not exceed 25% of the claimant\u2019s past due benefits. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 406(b). And the aggregate of the attorney\u2019s fees awarded under \u00a7 406(a) and \u00a7 406(b) may not exceed 25% of the claimant\u2019s past due benefits. <em>Dawson v. Finch, </em>425 F.2d 1192, 1195 (5th Cir.1970).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Awards under \u00a7 406 are paid \u201cby the claimant out of the past-due benefits awarded.\u201d <em>Jackson v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>601 F.3d 1268, 1271 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-13\">In this case, the district court did not abuse its discretion because it was not authorized to award additional attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 406(b). The SSA had already awarded 25% of Bookman\u2019s past-due benefits to her attorney under \u00a7 406(a), and any additional award under \u00a7 406(b) would have resulted in an aggregate award that exceeded the maximum allowable under \u00a7 406. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b342-14\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-15\">Bookman also contends that the district court abused its discretion when it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>calculated her award for attorney\u2019s fees under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412, which permits a prevailing party to recover from the United States fees and other expenses incurred in proceedings for judicial review of an agency action under some circumstances. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(a)(1), (d)(1)(A). An award under 28 U.S.C. 2412 is \u201cin addition to and separate from\u201d any fees awarded under 42 U.S.C \u00a7 406. <em>See Jackson, </em>601 F.3d at 1271. Courts use a two-step process to determine the appropriate hourly rate, first determining the market rate for similar services by similar attorneys and then determining whether an increase in the cost of living or a special factor justifies adjusting the hourly rate higher than the statutory cap of $125. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 2412(d)(2)(A)(ii); <em>Meyer v. Sullivan, </em>958 F.2d 1029, 1033 (11th Cir.1992). The applicant for attorney\u2019s fees bears the burden of demonstrating the market rate. <em>See Norman v. Housing Auth. of City of Montgomery, </em>836 F.2d 1292, 1299 (11th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by setting the hourly rate at $125. Bookman presented no evidence about the market rate for similar services by similar attorneys. Because she did not show that the market rate was higher than $125, the district court was not required to determine whether a cost-of-living adjustment to the hourly rate was appropriate.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b342-9\">. In <em>Bonner v. City of Prichard, </em>661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir.1981) (en banc), we adopted as binding precedent all decisions of the former Fifth Circuit handed down before October 1, 1981.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b343-8\">. Bookman also states in her brief that the district court reduced the number of hours billed from 82.8 to 23, which she says is \"too much.\u201d She does not, however, identify which hours were improperly discounted or cite any authority as to why the court abused its discretion. Accordingly, she has abandoned any challenge to the district court\u2019s finding that 23 hours were reasonable. <em>See Hamilton v. Southland Christian Sch., Inc., </em>680 F.3d 1316, 1319 (11th Cir.2012) (\"A passing reference to an issue in a brief is not enough, and the failure to make arguments and cite authorities in support of an issue waives it.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
