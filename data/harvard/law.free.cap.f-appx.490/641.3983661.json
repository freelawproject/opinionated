He argues that the sentence is substantively unreasonable and too severe, given that he cooperated and assisted law enforcement officers, he was not armed, and he took a small amount of money totaling just over $2000 from all three banks. Because Gable did not object to the substantive reasonableness of the sentence in the district court, review is limited to plain error. <em>See United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number><em>States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391-92 (5th Cir .2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">The district court did not err in imposing the 78-month within-guidelines sentence. <em>See Gall v. United, States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Gable\u2019s within-guidelines sentence is presumed reasonable. <em>See United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009). The district court considered Gable\u2019s arguments for a lesser sentence, including his mental health and drug addiction problems, as well as the Presen-tence Report, the applicable guidelines range, and the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The Presentence Report noted that Gable was unarmed, that he cooperated with the Government, and that he took a relatively small amount of money. Gable has not shown that the district court made a clear error of judgment in balancing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. See <em>Cooks, </em>589 F.3d at 186. His arguments constitute a disagreement with the district court\u2019s weighing of those factors; he is essentially asking this court to reweigh the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, which it may not do. <em>See id.; United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir.2008). Therefore, Gable has not shown that the district court erred, plainly or otherwise, in imposing the 78-month within-guidelines sentence. <em>See Cooks, </em>589 F.3d at 186; <em>Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d at 565-66.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b667-9\"><em> </em>Pursuant to 5th Cir.
