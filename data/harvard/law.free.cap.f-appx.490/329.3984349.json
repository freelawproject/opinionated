He was sentenced in January 2011 to a 120-month prison sentence, in accordance with the pre-sentence report (PSR). The PSR recommended a range of 120 to 121 months, based on a 120-month, or ten-year, mandatory minimum under \u00a7 841(b)(l)(A)(iii). McCrary filed a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion in November 2011, ar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>guing that he was entitled to resentencing under Amendment 750 to the Sentencing Guidelines as it applied to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1. The district court denied the motion, and McCrary appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusion that a defendant is not eligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. Glover, </em>686 F.3d 1203, 1206 (11th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">To begin, the arguments McCrary raise in his brief do not relate to his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. Instead, McCrary pursues claims on appeal relating to ineffective assistance of counsel, which we will not address here.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 782 (11th Cir.2000) (declining to consider \u201cextraneous resentencing issues\u201d unrelated to \u00a7 3582(c)(2)). With regard to his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, we affirm the district court. Section 3582(c)(2) allows a district court to resentence a federal prisoner \u201cbased on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). However, the Sentencing Commission has not lowered the sentencing range as it applies to McCrary\u2019s conviction insofar as he was sentenced in January 2011, and his sentencing range has not \u201csubsequently been lowered\u201d since that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">The Sentencing Commission implemented an emergency amendment \u2014 Amendment 748 \u2014 to the Guidelines on November 1, 2010 to reduce sentences for cocaine base offenses, pursuant to the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010, Pub.L. No. 111-220, 124 Stat. 2372 (2010). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, amend. 748. At the time of McCrary\u2019s sentencing in January 2011, his PSR recommended a Guidelines range in accordance with the Sentencing Guidelines Manual effective November 1, 2010. Effective November 1, 2011, the Sentencing Commission promulgated Amendment 750, which made permanent the emergency revisions of Amendment 748. <em>See id., </em>amend. 750. Amendment 750 did not further lower the sentencing ranges under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c). <em>See id. </em>In other words, McCrary had already benefitted from the reduced sentencing range under \u00a7 2D1.1 for offenses involving cocaine base.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-12\">We also observe that McCrary\u2019s sentence was based on a statutory mandatory minimum of 120 months. We have repeatedly held that \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief is not available to defendants who were sentenced on the basis of a statutory mandatory minimum. <em>See Glover, </em>686 F.3d at 1206-07; <em>United States v. Mills, </em>613 F.3d 1070, 1079 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-13\">Because the relevant sentencing range has not been lowered by the Sentencing Commission since McCrary\u2019s sentencing, the district court lacked authority to re-sentence him under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See Glover, </em>686 F.3d at 1208.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-14\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-15\">For these reasons, we AFFIRM the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b356-8\">. In January 2012, McCrary filed a motion to vacate his sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, claiming ineffective assistance of counsel. This motion remains pending before the district court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
