She argues that the district court erred by applying the enhancements in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1, that the sentence is substantively unreasonable because her codefendant received a lower sentence, and that the district court unconstitutionally relied on facts not proved be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>yond a reasonable doubt in imposing sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">Section 2K2.1 was not used to calculate Rodriguez\u2019s offense level; Rodriguez\u2019s offense level was calculated using the cross-reference in \u00a7 2M5.2. This claim of error presents no issue for appeal as it is based on an erroneous reading of the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">Rodriguez did not object to the substantive reasonableness of the sentence. Therefore, this claim of error is reviewed for plain error. <em>See United States v. Pel-tier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391 (5th Cir.2007). Rodriguez recruited her codefendant into participating in the offense, and her code-fendant purchased fewer firearms. Given the differences in Rodriguez\u2019s and her co-defendant\u2019s respective culpability, any disparity in their sentences was not unwarranted. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(6). Moreover, \u201cthe sentencing judge is in a superior position to find facts and judge their import under \u00a7 3553(a) with respect to a particular defendant.\u201d <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 339 (5th Cir.2008). Rodriguez has failed to rebut the presumption of reasonableness that is accorded to her within-guidelines sentence. <em>See United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009). There was no error, plain or otherwise, with respect to the substantive reasonableness of her sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">Rodriguez\u2019s claim of constitutional error is raised for the first time on appeal and thus is reviewed for plain error. <em>See United States v. Rodarte-Vasquez, </em>488 F.3d 316, 321 (5th Cir.2007). The district court did not err by enhancing Rodriguez\u2019s sentence on the basis of facts not proved beyond a reasonable doubt because Rodriguez was convicted and sentenced under the advisory sentencing regime and the facts relied on by the district court did not increase the statutory maximum sentence. <em>See United States v. Thompson, </em>454 F.3d 459, 467-68 (5th Cir.2006). There was no constitutional error, plain or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-12\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b668-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
