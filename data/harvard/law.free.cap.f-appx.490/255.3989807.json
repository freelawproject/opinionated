On appeal, Martin argues that: (1) the district court erred in admitting testimony that a drug-detection dog signaled the presence of drugs on money seized from Martin; (2) there was insufficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>evidence to convict him of a single conspiracy to possess cocaine and marijuana, instead of multiple conspiracies; (3) the district court erred in denying his motion for new trial because (a) the evidence established only his \u201cmere presence\u201d in the house where drugs were sold, (b) the government did not prove a nexus between Martin\u2019s possession of a firearm and the drug-trafficking enterprise, and (c) the drug conspiracy count was duplicitous; and (4) his sentence was procedurally and substantively unreasonable because the court failed to make an individualized finding regarding drug quantity, failed to reduce his offense level based on his minor role in the offense, and should have imposed only the 60-month mandatory minimum term for Counts 1 and 4. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">A district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings are reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Perez-Oliveros, </em>479 F.3d 779, 783 (11th Cir.2007). Whether the evidentiary ruling violated a constitutional guarantee is reviewed <em>de novo. United States v. Sarras, </em>575 F.3d 1191, 1209 n. 24 (11th Cir.2009). \u201cWe review the sufficiency of evidence supporting a criminal conviction <em>de novo, </em>with the evidence viewed in the light most favorable to the government and all reasonable inferences and credibility choices made in the government\u2019s favor.\u201d <em>United States v. Frank, </em>599 F.3d 1221, 1233 (11th Cir.2010) (quotations omitted). The district court\u2019s denial of a motion for new trial is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Lee, </em>586 F.3d 859, 865 (11th Cir.2009). We review the legal correctness of jury instructions <em>de novo </em>and the district court\u2019s phrasing of the instructions for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Prather, </em>205 F.3d 1265, 1270 (11th Cir.2000). The sentence a district court imposes is reviewed for \u201creasonableness,\u201d which \u201cmerely asks whether the trial court abused its discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1189 (11th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 351, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007)). Finally, we review for clear error a district court\u2019s determination of whether a defendant is entitled to a mitigating-role reduction. <em>United States v. De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 937 (11th Cir.1999) (en banc).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b283-8\">First, we are unpersuaded by Martin\u2019s claim that the district court erred in admitting testimony that a drug-detection dog signaled the presence of drugs on money seized from Martin. In <em>United States v. Hernando Ospina, </em>798 F.2d 1570, 1583 (11th Cir.1986), we held that testimony that drug-detecting dogs signaled the presence of narcotics \u201cwas obviously relevant as having a tendency to make the existence of a fact, <em>i.e., </em>that the currency was tainted by narcotics, more probable than it would be without the evidence, under Fed.R.Evid. 401.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b283-9\">Here, the district court did not abuse its discretion in allowing the dog handler\u2019s testimony. We have said in the context of examining an officer\u2019s reliance on a dog alert to establish probable cause that the \u201ctraining of a dog alone is sufficient proof of reliability.\u201d <em>United States v. Sentovich, </em>677 F.2d 834, 838 n. 8 (11th Cir.1982). The government presented extensive proof that the dog had been trained and certified and was reliable \u2014 including that the dog had completed a 260-hour class with his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>handler, had been \u201ccertified\u201d annually, and participated in regular training exercises with his handler once or twice a week. Thus, the handler\u2019s testimony that the dog signaled the presence of drugs on Martin\u2019s money was relevant to the issue of whether Martin possessed cocaine with the intent to distribute it.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">Next, we find no merit in Martin\u2019s claim that there was insufficient evidence to convict him of a single conspiracy to possess cocaine and marijuana. \u201cTo sustain a conviction for conspiracy to distribute narcotics the government must prove that (1) an agreement existed between two or more people to distribute the drugs; (2) that the defendant at issue knew of the conspiratorial goal; and (3) that he knowingly joined or participated in the illegal venture.\u201d <em>United States v. Brown, </em>587 F.3d 1082, 1089 (11th Cir.2009) (quotations omitted). \u201cIn determining whether a jury could have found a single conspiracy, this Court considers: (1) whether a common goal existed; (2) the nature of the underlying scheme; and (3) the overlap of participants.\u201d <em>United States v. Moore, </em>525 F.3d 1033, 1042 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">\u201cA variance occurs when the evidence at trial establishes facts materially different from those alleged in the indictment.\u201d <em>United States v. Reed, </em>980 F.2d 1568, 1581 (11th Cir.1993). \u201cWe do not reverse convictions because a single conspiracy is charged in the indictment while multiple conspiracies may have been revealed at the trial unless the variance is [1] material <em>and </em>[2] substantially prejudiced the defendant.\u201d <em>Brown, </em>587 F.3d at 1092 (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">Here, there was no material variance, because, viewed in the light most favorable to the government, the evidence at trial was sufficient to establish a single conspiracy to distribute cocaine and marijuana from January 2009 through September 2, 2009, as alleged in the indictment. The confidential informant, William Alderman, testified that Martin served as an armed guard and doorman during Alderman\u2019s transactions with Anthony Terry. Aider-man testified that, every time he bought drugs from Terry, Martin was there with a gun. On the day of the controlled buy, Martin answered the door carrying a Glock .40 caliber handgun. Martin observed the entire drug transaction and followed Alderman to the door after it was completed. Alderman also testified that he had seen Martin selling smaller amounts of cocaine. Moreover, Martin was carrying $1320 at the time of arrest that, the evidence suggested, had been in contact with narcotics.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">On this record, the evidence established that Martin worked in furtherance of the drug distribution scheme by serving as an armed doorman during Terry\u2019s drug sales and by selling small amounts of drugs himself. Further, even if there were multiple conspiracies, Martin could not have been substantially prejudiced at trial, because the case involves only two defendants and the jury was unlikely to be confused by the evidence about Martin\u2019s role. <em>See Reed, </em>980 F.2d at 1583. Thus, the jury was entitled to infer Martin\u2019s participation in a single conspiracy to sell narcotics from January 2009 until September 2009. Because this was the conspiracy charged in the indictment, Martin is not entitled to relief from the conspiracy conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-9\">We also disagree with Martin\u2019s argument that the district court erred in denying his motion for new trial. \u201cOn a motion for a new trial based on the weight of the evidence, the [district] court need not view the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict,\u201d instead, \u201cmay weigh the evidence and consider the credibility of the witnesses.\u201d <em>United States v. Martinez, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>763 F.2d 1297, 1312 (11th Cir.1985). However, it \u201cmay not reweigh the evidence and set aside the verdict simply because it feels some other result would be more reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1312-13. We have noted that such motions \u201care not favored,\u201d and are to be granted \u201csparingly and with caution,\u201d and only in \u201cexceptional cases.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1313.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">As we\u2019ve just briefly described, the evidence established that Martin was more than a mere bystander, that he exercised dominion and control over the cocaine that was sold, and that he intentionally contributed to and furthered a criminal offense. This conclusion is further supported by the additional trial testimony from a woman who said that Martin was alone in the house when she arrived with Terry on the day of the arrest, and that she had seen Martin coming from the back part of the house. Moreover, to the extent that Martin is raising for the first time a challenge to the court\u2019s instructions to the jury, he did not request an instruction on mere presence with respect to the drug possession count, and has not shown that the jury instructions were plain error. <em>See Olmo, </em>507 U.S. at 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">The jury\u2019s determination that Martin possessed a firearm in furtherance of the charged conspiracy and drug crimes was not contrary to the weight of the evidence, as the government established a sufficient nexus between his possession of the gun and the charged crimes. Again, as we\u2019ve detailed, Alderman testified that, on several occasions beginning in January 2009, Martin greeted him at the door with a Glock .40 and watched over his drug transactions with Terry. Moreover, a Glock .40 was recovered from the house, under a couch near a coffee table holding a scale with a small amount of cocaine. Other drugs were recovered from the house. All of the items were recovered as a result of a search of the house based on a warrant that was obtained after a controlled drug buy. On this record, the jury\u2019s determination that Martin\u2019s possession of the gun was in furtherance of the charged conspiracy and drug crimes, was not contrary to the weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-10\">In addition, because this case involved a single conspiracy involving two conspiratorial <em>goals\u2014ie., </em>the distribution of cocaine and the distribution of marijuana\u2014the conspiracy charged in the indictment was not duplicitous. <em>See Braverman v. United States, </em>317 U.S. 49, 54, 63 S.Ct. 99, 87 L.Ed. 23 (1942) (holding that the allegation of a single count of a conspiracy to commit several crimes is not duplicitous). Moreover, Martin waived any challenge to the indictment on that ground by failing to raise it before trial. The district court properly denied Martin\u2019s motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-11\">Nor has Martin shown that his sentence was unreasonable. In reviewing sentences for reasonableness, we typically perform two steps. <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1190. First, we \u201c \u2018ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence\u2014including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b286-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>If we conclude that the district court did not procedurally err, we must consider the \u201c \u2018substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard,\u2019 \u201d based on the \u201c \u2018totality of the circumstances.\u2019\u201d <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1190 (quoting <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586). This review is \u201cdeferential,\u201d requiring us to determine \u201cwhether the sentence imposed by the district court fails to achieve the purposes of sentencing as stated in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir. 2005). \u201c[W]e will not second guess the weight (or lack thereof) that the [district court] accorded to a given factor ... as long as the sentence ultimately imposed is reasonable in light of all the circumstances presented.\u201d <em>United States v. Snipes, </em>611 F.3d 855, 872 (11th Cir.2010) (quotation, alteration and emphasis omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2962, 180 L.Ed.2d 245 (2011). We will \u201cvacate the sentence if, but only if, we are left with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>See United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1190 (11th Cir.2010) <em>(en banc) </em>(quotation omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 1813, 179 L.Ed.2d 772 (2011). The party challenging the sentence bears the burden of establishing unreasonableness. <em>United States v. Tome, </em>611 F.3d 1371, 1378 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">In ruling on a defendant\u2019s objection to facts set forth in the PSI, \u201cthe district court must either (1) make an explicit factual finding as to the allegation; or (2) determine that no such finding is necessary because the matter controverted will not be taken into account in sentencing the defendant.\u201d <em>United States v. Lawrence, </em>47 F.3d 1559, 1567 (11th Cir.1995). If the effect of a drug quantity requires the imposition of a statutory minimum sentence, the district court \u201cmust sentence the defendant based on an individualized finding, supportable by a preponderance of the evidence, as to the drug quantity foreseeable by that defendant.\u201d <em>United States v. Bacon, </em>598 F.3d 772, 778 (11th Cir.2010). If, however, the court does not make individualized findings, the sentence may nevertheless be upheld if the record supports the amount of drugs attributed to a defendant. <em>United States v. Ismond, </em>993 F.2d 1498, 1499 (11th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-9\">For a sentencing court to determine whether to grant a minor-role reduction, it considers two principles. <em>De Var\u00f3n, </em>175 F.3d at 940. First, the court must measure the defendant\u2019s role against the relevant conduct for which he is being held accountable. <em>Id. </em>The second prong of the minor-role-reduction analysis permits a district court, \u201cwhere the record evidence is sufficient ... [, to] measure the defendant\u2019s conduct against that of other participants in the criminal scheme attributed to the defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 934.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-10\">Here, the district court did not err in its adoption of the probation officer\u2019s determination of drug quantity in the PSI. Alderman\u2019s testimony that, during February through April of 2009, he purchased an eighth of a kilogram from Terry two or three times each week, while Martin was working for Terry, supports the attribu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>tion of 2803.44 grams of cocaine to Martin. As for the marijuana in the case, the court was not required to make a specific finding because it held that the amount of marijuana would not affect Martin\u2019s sentence. <em>See Lawrence, </em>47 F.3d at 1567. But even if the district court failed to make sufficient individualized findings, we can uphold Martin\u2019s sentence because the record supports the amount of drugs that were attributed to him. <em>See Ismond, </em>993 F.2d at 1499.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">We also reject Martin\u2019s contention that the court erred in not awarding him a minor-role reduction. The relevant conduct for which the district court held Martin accountable included only Terry\u2019s drug sales to Alderman from January until April of 2009, while Martin had served as Terry\u2019s armed doorman and guard. As noted, the evidence at trial established that Martin participated in each of Terry\u2019s drug transactions with Alderman during this time by serving as the armed doorman and by watching over the transactions with the .40 caliber gun in his hand. Because the court held Martin accountable for his own conduct in participating in these transactions, it did not abuse its discretion in not applying a mitigating role reduction. <em>See De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 941.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">Finally, Martin\u2019s sentence was substantively reasonable. A significant sentence was warranted in this case. Martin\u2019s conduct involved repeatedly pointing a gun directly at someone, and participating in a significant drug-trafficking enterprise. The district court could have imposed a sentence of up to 40 years\u2019 imprisonment on count one and up to 20 years\u2019 imprisonment on count 4. Under these circumstance, his 72-month, below-guidelines-range sentence on his two drug convictions was substantively reasonable. <em>See United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir.2008) (comparing, as indication of reasonableness, sentence imposed against statutory maximum penalty).</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b283-6\">. However, new arguments not raised in the district court are reviewed only for plain error. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). The requirements for plain error are as follows: (1) an error occurred (2) that was plain and (3) affected substantial rights, and (4) not correcting the error would seriously affect the fairness of the judicial proceeding. <em>Id. </em>at 732-35, 113 S.Ct. 1770.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b285-7\">.
