In dismissing the claims, the district court certified that any appeal would not be taken in good faith, and the magistrate judge later determined that in light of this certification, Terry\u2019s IFP motion was moot. By moving in this court for IFP status, Terry is challenging the district court\u2019s certification. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-22\">Because the district court dismissed some but not all of Terry\u2019s claims, this court first must examine whether it' has jurisdiction to consider the appeal. <em>See Martin v. Halliburton, </em>618 F.3d 476, 481 (5th Cir.2010). We generally have jurisdiction only over appeals from final judgments. <em>Id.; see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. However, in the judgment from which Terry appeals, the district court invoking Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b), specifically stated that there was \u201cno just reason for delay,\u201d and ordered the clerk to enter \u201cfinal judgment.\u201d Thus, this case falls within an exception to the general rule, and we have jurisdiction to consider Terry\u2019s appeal. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b); <em>Cherry v. Shaw Coastal, Inc., </em>668 F.3d 182, 187 n. 3 (5th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-23\">In her motion for IFP and brief on the merits, Terry makes only general allega<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>tions that her appeal is not frivolous, that the civil rights claims have merit, and that the defendants inappropriately boarded up her apartment. She does not address the district court\u2019s reasons for its certification decision, namely that her civil rights claims were untimely and that she was not authorized to represent her children in court. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202. Terry, thus, has abandoned her challenge to the district court\u2019s certification decision. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas Cnty. Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir. 1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">Terry has not shown that the district court\u2019s certification was incorrect. Her appeal is without arguable merit and is thus frivolous. Accordingly, Terry\u2019s IFP motion is DENIED, and her appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b686-24\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
