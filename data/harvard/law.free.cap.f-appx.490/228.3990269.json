Morman argues that the district court erred by sentencing him to the mandatory minimum in effect at the time of his crime instead of the mandatory minimum provided in the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 (\u201cFSA\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">Morman\u2019s offense conduct \u2014 the sale of 24.6 grams of cocaine base to a confidential source-occurred in 2008; his sentencing hearing was held on 5 January 2011. The FSA had an effective date of 3 August 2010. Morman argued at his sentencing hearing and argues again on appeal that he is entitled to the benefit of the FSA\u2019s reduced mandatory m\u00ednimums. Under the changes effected by the FSA, the 24.6 grams of cocaine base would not trigger the 5-year mandatory minimum that was applied to him at sentencing. <em>Compare </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(B)(iii) (2010) (prescribing 5-year mandatory minimum for 28 or more grams) <em>with </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(B)(iii) (2008) (triggering a 5-year mandatory minimum for 5 or more grams).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">The Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Dorsey v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 2321, 183 L.Ed.2d 250 (2012), is decisive for the issue raised in this appeal. In <em>Dorsey, </em>the Supreme Court \u201cconclude[d] that Congress intended the Fair Sentencing Act\u2019s new, lower mandatory m\u00ednimums to apply to the post-Act sentencing of pre-Act offenders.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2335. Under <em>Dorsey, </em>the more lenient mandatory m\u00ednimums set out in the Fair Sentencing Act apply to Morman\u2019s post-Act sentencing for pre-Act offense conduct. We vacate Morman\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing consistent with <em>Dorsey.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b255-9\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
