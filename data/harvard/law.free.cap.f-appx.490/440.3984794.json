For the reasons that follow, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-20\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-21\">In August 2010, Garraway commenced a <em>Bivens </em>action<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> claiming that certain rules and policies instituted by the Federal Bureau of Prisons (\u201cBOP\u201d) \u201cseverely and unnecessarily\u201d burdened his ability to practice his Muslim faith, in violation of his First Amendment free exercise rights. He brought statutory claims under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (\u201cRFRA\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000bb <em>et seq., </em>and the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (\u201cRLUIPA\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000cc <em>et seq. </em>He named as Defendants several current and former employees of USP-Lewisburg and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>United States Penitentiary in Canaan (\u201cUSP-Canaan\u201d), having been an inmate at both facilities during the time period set forth in his complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">Defendants filed a motion to dismiss, or in the alternative, for summary judgment, with respect to all of Garraway\u2019s claims. The District Court granted the motion on March 21, 2012, and entered final judgment in favor of Defendants. Garraway timely filed a Notice of Appeal on March 27, 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">Jurisdiction is proper under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment if the appeal presents no substantial question. <em>See </em>3d Cir. LAE 27.4 and I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">We exercise plenary review over an order dismissing claims under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). <em>Monroe v. Beard, </em>536 F.3d 198, 205 (3d Cir.2008). \u201cReviewing such an order, we accept as true all allegations in the plaintiffs complaint as well as all reasonable inferences that can be drawn from them, and we construe them in a light most favorable to the non-movant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-9\">A complaint must contain \u201ca short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\u201d Fed. R.Civ.P. 8(a)(2). This pleading standard \u201cdoes not require \u2018detailed factual allegations,\u2019 but it demands more than an unadorned, the-defendant-unlawfully-harmed-me accusation.\u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (citing <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twom-bly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007)). \u201cA pleading that offers \u2018labels and conclusions\u2019 or \u2018a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201c[A] complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to \u2018state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id.; see also Twombly, </em>550 U.S. at 556, 127 S.Ct. 1955 (explaining that a plaintiff must \u201cidentify[ ] facts that are suggestive enough to render [his claim] plausible.\u201d) \u201c[0]nly a complaint that states a plausible claim for relief survives a motion to dismiss.\u201d <em>Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. at 679, 129 S.Ct. 1937.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-12\">We also exercise plenary review over a grant of summary judgment and \u201cemploy the same standard as applied below.\u201d <em>De-Hart v. Horn, </em>390 F.3d 262, 267 (3d Cir. 2004). That is, \u201c[t]he court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(a). \u201cIn reviewing the grant of summary judgment, we must affirm if the record evidence submitted by the non-movant is merely colorable or is not significantly probative.\u201d <em>DeHart, </em>390 F.3d at 267-68 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-13\">Claims under the First Amendment and claims under the RFRA are analyzed separately.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> When a prisoner asserts a First Amendment free exercise claim that \u201ca prison policy is impinging on [his] constitutional rights,\u201d the court must then apply the four factor test set forth in <em>Turner v. Safley, </em>482 U.S. 78, 107 S.Ct. 2254, 96 L.Ed.2d 64 (1987), to determine whether the curtailment at issue is \u201creasonably related to penological interests.\u201d <em>DeHart v. Horn, </em>227 F.3d 47, 51 (3d Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>2000) (citing <em>Turner, </em>482 U.S. at 89, 107 S.Ct. 2254). As this Court has explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Af7\"><em>[Turner] </em>directs courts to assess the overall reasonableness of such regulations by weighing four factors. \u201cFirst, there must be a \u2018valid, rational connection\u2019 between the prison regulation and the legitimate governmental interest put forward to justify it,\u201d and this connection must not be \u201cso remote as to render the policy arbitrary or irrational.\u201d Second, a court must consider whether inmates retain alternative means of exercising the circumscribed right. Third, a court must take into account the costs that accommodating the right would impose on other inmates, guards, and prison resources generally. And fourth, a court must consider whether there are alternatives to the regulation that \u201cfully accommodate[ ] the prisoner\u2019s rights at de minimis cost to valid penological interests.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-4\"><em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Waterman v. Farmer, </em>183 F.3d 208, 213 (3d Cir.1999) (internal citations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">In contrast, a challenged restraint on the freedom of religion does not fall within the scope of the RFRA unless the inmate can establish that a \u201csubstantial burden\u201d is placed on his ability to exercise said freedom. <em>Small v. Lehman, </em>98 F.3d 762, 767(3d Cir.1996), <em>overruled on other grounds by City of Boerne v. Flores, </em>521 U.S. 507, 117 S.Ct. 2157, 138 L.Ed.2d 624 (1997).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This Court has said that a substantial burden exists where:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-6\">(1) a follower is forced to choose between following the precepts of his religion and forfeiting benefits otherwise generally available to other inmates 'versus abandoning one of the precepts of his religion in order to receive a benefit; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-9\">(2) the government puts substantial pressure on an adherent to substantially modify his behavior and to violate his beliefs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-10\"><em>Washington v. Klem, </em>497 F.3d 272, 280 (3d Cir.2007). It is only once a substantial burden on religion has been established by the prisoner that the government must then establish \u201cthat it has a \u2018compelling interest\u2019 in its actions and is furthering that interest by the \u2018least restrictive means.\u2019\u201d <em>Small, </em>98 F.3d at 767 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-12\">The District Court addressed Garra-way\u2019s numerous claims by subject matter. In his argument in support of appeal, Garraway highlighted the following issues as violative of his First Amendment free exercise rights and the RFRA: (1) prison policies limiting group prayer; (2) the lack of a full-time Sunni Muslim chaplain; (3) prison policies regarding an Islamic Halal diet; (4) prison policies limiting the number of books he can keep in his cell; and (5) the availability of ceremonial religious items. We will first consider these claims before turning to the remainder of those addressed in the District Court\u2019s Memorandum.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-13\">1. Prison Policies Limiting Group Prayer</p>\n<p id=\"b470-14\">Garraway claimed that the prison regulation regarding congregational worship violated his First Amendment free exercise rights. The regulation in question, BOP Program Statement 5360.09.7.a, states, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>The level of scheduled activities is expected to be commensurate with the institution\u2019s mission/need. Authorized congregate services will be made available for all inmates weekly with the exception of those detained in any Special Housing Units (SHUs). If a state of emergency exists (e.g. fog, institution lock down, food strike), the warden or designee will determine the appropriate level of chapel programming.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">(Dkt. No. 39, Ex. 1, Attach.B.)</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">\u201cWhen a prison regulation impinges on inmates\u2019 constitutional rights, the regulation is valid if it is reasonably related to legitimate penological interests.\u201d <em>Turner, </em>482 U.S. at 89, 107 S.Ct. 2254. The District Court aptly applied the four-part <em>Turner </em>analysis in determining that Garraway\u2019s First Amendment right to free exercise was not impermissibly impinged by this regulation. (Dkt. No. 65, pp. 20-29.) That analysis need not be repeated here. Garraway did not allege that the policy substantially burdened his ability to exercise his religion. Without establishing a substantial burden, his claim under the RFRA fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">2. Lack of a Full-Time Sunni Muslim Chaplain</p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">Garraway claimed that Defendants violated his First Amendment rights and the RFRA \u201cby refusing to provide a full-time Sunni Muslim chaplain ... while providing ... two to three Christian chaplains for Christian inmates.\u201d (Dkt. No. 27, \u00b6\u00b6 22, 44.)</p>\n<p id=\"b471-9\">\u201cA special chapel or place of worship need not be provided for every faith regardless of size; nor must a chaplain, priest, or minister be provided without regard to the extent of the demand.\u201d <em>Cruz v. Beto, </em>405 U.S. 319, 322 n. 2, 92 S.Ct. 1079, 31 L.Ed.2d 263 (1972) (per curiam); <em>see also Gittlemacker v. Prasse, </em>428 F.2d 1, 4 (3d Cir.1970) (no affirmative duty to provide an inmate with a clergyman of his choice). Nonetheless, it is undisputed that Defendants provided Muslim chaplains as they became available. (Dkt. No. 40, \u00b6\u00b6 16-17; Dkt. No. 50, Attach. 3, \u00b6\u00b6 16-17.) Garraway has not alleged that there is a prison policy impinging on his First Amendment rights. Therefore, it is not necessary to undertake a <em>Turner </em>analysis. Nor has Garraway alleged that the lack of a full-time Sunni Muslim chaplain substantially burdens the exercise of his religion. Without establishing a substantial burden, his claim under the RFRA fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-11\">3. Prison Policies Regarding an Islamic Halal Diet</p>\n<p id=\"b471-12\">Garraway claimed that Defendants violated his First Amendment rights by failing to provide an Islamic Halal diet. Religious diets are provided in accordance with the following BOP policy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-13\">The Bureau provides inmates requesting a religious diet reasonable and equitable opportunity to observe their religious dietary practice within the constraints of budget limitations and the security and orderly running of the institution and the Bureau through a religious diet menu.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-14\">28 C.F.R. \u00a7 548.20(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-15\">Again, the District Court ably applied the requisite four-part <em>Turner </em>analysis, concluding that the regulation in question did not impermissibly curtail Garraway\u2019s right to free exercise of his religion. (Dkt. No. 65 at pp. 35-39); <em>see also Williams v. Morton, </em>343 F.3d 212, 220 (3d Cir.2003) (rejecting inmates\u2019 claim that failure to provide Halal meat in lieu of vegetarian meals violated their First Amendment rights).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>4.Prison Policies Limiting the Number of Books Kept in an Inmate\u2019s Cell</p>\n<p id=\"A-2\">Garraway claimed that the BOP regulation limiting the number of books an inmate may have as personal property in his cell substantially burdened his ability to exercise his religion. The regulation in question, BOP Program Statement 5580.07, instituted a national limit of five books per inmate, regardless of topic. (Dkt. No. 39, Ex. 1, Attach.C.) According to Defendants, this limit was imposed in the interest of security, fire safety, and sanitation, as it allowed proper cell searches and limited the places inmates could store contraband. (Dkt. No. 40, \u00b6 51-52.) Garraway did not dispute that the BOP provided him with religious texts. (Dkt. No. 40, \u00b6\u00b6 42-43; Dkt No. 50, Attach. 3, \u00b6\u00b6 42-43.) However, he claimed that Defendants \u201cexaggerated\u201d the security concerns addressed by BOP Program Statement 5580.07. (Dkt. No. 50, Attach.3, \u00b6\u00b6 51-52.)</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">The District Court correctly considered the <em>Turner </em>factors in reaching the conclusion that the BOP regulation did not impermissibly impinge on Garraway\u2019s free exercise of his religion. (Dkt. No. 65 at 45-46.) Further, no facts supported Garraway\u2019s claim that the five book national limit substantially burdened his ability to practice his religion. This Court\u2019s decision in <em>Washington v. Klem, </em>497 F.3d 272 (3d Cir.2007), is distinguishable. There, an inmate argued that his religion required \u201ca daily reading of four Afro-centric books,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 281, and that the prison\u2019s ten-book limitation substantially burdened the practice of his religion, <em>id. </em>at 282-83. Garraway makes no such claim. Without establishing a substantial burden, his claim under the RFRA fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">5. Availability of Ceremonial Religious Items</p>\n<p id=\"b472-9\">Garraway claimed his First Amendment rights were violated because Islamic ceremonial religious items were sold in the BOP commissary with marked-up prices, in violation of BOP policy. Defendants provided evidence that the items were not sold with a mark-up. (Dkt. No. 39, Ex. 1, Attach. E and Attach. F.) Garraway responded with an unsupported assertion that the evidence provided by Defendants contained \u201cfalse and misleading\u201d information. (Dkt. No. 50-4, \u00b6 16.) There being no genuine issue of material fact, the District Court correctly granted summary judgment in favor of Defendants. We will affirm. <em>See DeHart, </em>390 F.3d at 267-68 (\u201cIn reviewing the grant of summary judgment, we must affirm if the record evidence submitted by the non-movant is merely colorable or is not significantly probative.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-10\">6. Garraway\u2019s Remaining Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b472-11\">We have thoroughly reviewed the District Court\u2019s Memorandum and Order, together with the record below. Garraway\u2019s remaining claims were either properly dismissed <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> or summary judgment was properly entered<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> in favor of the Defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-12\">Because no substantial question is presented by this appeal, we will summarily affirm the order of the District Court granting Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>in the alternative, for summary judgment,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> pursuant to Third Circuit LAR 27.4 and I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b468-12\">. <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Fed. Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b469-10\">. The District Court properly dismissed Garr-away\u2019s RLUIPA claims because RLUIPA does not apply to a federal government action. <em>Navajo Nation v. U.S. Forest Serv., </em>535 F.3d 1058, 1077 (9th Cir.2008); <em>Rogers v. United States, </em>696 F.Supp.2d 472, 486 (W.D.Pa. 2010); <em>see also Sharp v.

It is unclear from the District Court\u2019s opinion whether certain claims were dismissed or whether summary judgment was entered in favor of Defendants.
