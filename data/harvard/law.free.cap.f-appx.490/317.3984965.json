Lopes appeals his ten-month sentence, imposed following his revocation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>of supervised release pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e). Lopes originally pled guilty in 2006 to crack cocaine offenses, and received a total sentence of 97 months\u2019 imprisonment, followed by 4 years of supervised release.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In May 2010, the district court revoked his supervision and returned him to prison for eight months. In January 2012, the court revoked Lopes\u2019s supervised release for a second time and returned him to prison for ten months, to be followed by an additional two years of supervised release. On appeal, Lopes argues that the district court abused its discretion by imposing a revocation sentence that was both procedurally and substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">We review a sentence imposed upon revocation of supervised release for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Sweeting, </em>437 F.3d 1105, 1106-07 (11th Cir.2006). We examine the reasonableness of a defendant\u2019s sentence under a \u201cdeferential abuse-of-discretion standard,\u201d under which a district court\u2019s decision will not be disturbed unless that court \u201capplies an incorrect legal standard, follows improper procedures in making the determination, or makes findings of fact that are clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>United States v. Jordan, </em>582 F.3d 1239, 1249 (11th Cir.2009) (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">Based on the sentencing record, we conclude Lopes\u2019s sentence is procedurally reasonable. The district court fulfilled its obligation to consider Lopes\u2019s sentencing range established under the Guidelines. <em>United States v. Campbell, </em>473 F.3d 1345, 1349 (11th Cir.2007). The district court also considered the parties\u2019 arguments, which encompassed a number of pertinent 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, including Lopes\u2019s reform efforts or lack thereof, his criminal history, and the need to provide him with treatment, deter future criminal conduct, and protect the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-9\">We conclude that Lopes\u2019s sentence is substantively reasonable based on the district court\u2019s consideration of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir. 2008) (quotation omitted) (\u201cWe will defer to the district court\u2019s judgment regarding the weight given to the \u00a7 3553(a) factors unless the district court has made a clear error of judgment.\u201d). Contrary to Lopes\u2019s assertion on appeal, there is nothing to suggest that the court placed undue emphasis on his criminal history. We see no reason to disturb the district court\u2019s decision that a sentence at the high end of the Guidelines was appropriate for a defendant who, like Lopes, chose to continue to commit new crimes on successive occasions shortly after his release from federal custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b344-6\">. Following a grant of relief pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), the district court reduced Lopes's custodial sentence to \"time served\u201d in 2008.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
