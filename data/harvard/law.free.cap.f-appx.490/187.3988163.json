(\u201cKeaton\u201d) challenges the district court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction to discharge their attorney\u2019s lien against the proceeds of a settlement in the underlying lawsuit in this case. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-24\">Plaintiff Moreno Farms, Inc. employed Keaton as counsel to sue the Defendant Tomato Thyme Corporation in the Southern District of Florida, and suit was filed. Keaton later voluntarily withdrew, and filed an attorney\u2019s lien against any funds Moreno Farms might recover. (Dkt. 45-1 at 1.) The underlying lawsuit then settled for $50,000. Tomato Thyme paid that money into the court\u2019s registry, but the court did not disburse the funds because of Keaton\u2019s lien. Moreno Farms moved to discharge the lien. The district court re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>ferred the matter to a magistrate judge, who ultimately declared the lien invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">Keaton then appealed the magistrate judge\u2019s order to this court. We questioned our jurisdiction to hear that appeal. After the district court clarified that it had referred the matter of Keaton\u2019s lien under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(A), we dismissed that appeal for want of jurisdiction because the magistrate judge\u2019s order was not a final or appealable order. (Dkt.71); <em>see, e.g., Perez-Priego v. Alachua Cnty. Clerk of Court, </em>148 F.3d 1272, 1273 (11th Cir.1998). Keaton then moved the district court to vacate the magistrate judge\u2019s order. The district court denied that motion as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">Keaton now appeals the denial of its motion to vacate the magistrate judge\u2019s order. We are not reviewing the merits of the magistrate judge\u2019s order. Nor are we reviewing the magistrate judge\u2019 authority under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636 to enter an order invalidating Keaton\u2019s attorney\u2019s lien. Instead, Keaton contends that, under our precedent, the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to adjudicate the validity of its attorney\u2019s lien. <em>(See </em>Appellant\u2019s Br. at 15 (\u201cAppellant argues only one issue: jurisdiction.\u201d).)</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">We always have the \u201cpower\u201d and \u201cobligation\u201d to examine the district court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction. <em>See Fitzgerald v. Seaboard Sys. R.R., Inc., </em>760 F.2d 1249, 1251 (11th Cir.1985) (citing <em>Philbrook v. Glodgett, </em>421 U.S. 707, 95 S.Ct. 1893, 44 L.Ed.2d 525 (1975)). We review questions of subject matter jurisdiction de novo. <em>See Univ. of S. Ala. v. Am. Tobacco Co., </em>168 F.3d 405, 408 (11th Cir.1999) (citation omitted). We review a district court\u2019s decision to exercise supplemental jurisdiction for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Lucero v. Trosch, </em>121 F.3d 591, 598 (11th Cir.1997) (citing <em>Chandler v. Miller, </em>73 F.3d 1543, 1546 n. 3 (11th Cir.1996)).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-11\">When a district court has original jurisdiction over a claim, the court has supplemental jurisdiction over all claims which are part of the same case or controversy. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(a). The existence of an attorney\u2019s lien against a party\u2019s recovery in a lawsuit is part of the same case or controversy as the underlying lawsuit. <em>See Broughten v. Voss, </em>634 F.2d 880, 883 (5th Cir.1981); <em>Doggett v. Deauville Corp., </em>148 F.2d 881, 883 (5th Cir.1945).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b214-12\">A district court \u201cmay decline to exercise\u201d its supplemental jurisdiction in certain circumstances. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(c). A district court has considerable discretion in making that decision. <em>See, e.g., Osborn v. Haley, </em>549 U.S. 225, 245, 127 S.Ct. 881, 896, 166 L.Ed.2d 819 (2007) (\u201cEven if only state-law claims remained after resolution of the federal question, the District Court would have discretion, consistent with Article III, to retain jurisdiction.\u201d) (citation omitted); <em>Palmer v. Hosp. Auth. of Randolph Cnty., </em>22 F.3d 1559, 1569 (11th Cir.1994); <em>Faucher v. Rodziewicz, </em>891 F.2d 864, 871-72 (11th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-13\">The district court had original jurisdiction over the underlying lawsuit under 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 499e(5). Keaton filed an attorney\u2019s lien against any recovery Moreno Farms might obtain in the suit. The lawsuit ultimately settled, and Moreno Farms recovered $50,000. Thus, the court had supplemental jurisdiction to decide the validity of Keaton\u2019s lien against the $50,000.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b214-14\">The court exercised supplemental jurisdiction over Keaton\u2019s lien. This was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>an abuse of discretion. Neither \u00a7 1367(c) nor our cases <em>required </em>that the district court decline jurisdiction here.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">The order of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b214-7\">. In <em>Bonner v. City of Prichard, </em>661 F.2d 1206 (11th Cir.1981) (en banc), this court adopted these Fifth Circuit cases as binding precedent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b214-15\">. The district court's order dismissing the underlying lawsuit specifically retained jurisdiction over Keaton\u2019s lien. (Dkt. 44 at 2.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
