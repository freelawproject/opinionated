On appeal, Rosario argues that the ALJ erred by according little weight to her treating psychiatrist\u2019s medical opinions. Further, Rosario asserts that the ALJ\u2019s hypothetical question to the vocational expert failed to account for her moderate limitations in concentration, persistence, or pace, even though the ALJ found that they existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-19\">In Social Security appeals, we review the ALJ\u2019s decision as the Commissioner\u2019s final decision when, as in this case, the ALJ denies benefits and the Appeals Council denies review. <em>Doughty v. Apfel, </em>245 F.3d 1274, 1278 (11th Cir.2001). We review to determine \u201cwhether the Commissioner\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence and based on proper legal standards. Substantial evidence is more than a scintilla and is such relevant evidence as a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Winschel v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>631 F.3d 1176, 1178 (11th Cir .2011) (quotation marks omitted). \u201cWe may not decide the facts anew, reweigh the evidence, or substitute our judgment for that of the [Commissioner].\u201d <em>Bloodsworth v. Heckler, </em>703 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>F.2d 1233, 1239 (11th Cir.1983). If substantial evidence supports the decision we must affirm, even if the proof preponderates against it. <em>Miles v. Chater, </em>84 F.3d 1397, 1400 (11th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">In determining whether a claimant is disabled, the ALJ must complete a five-step sequential evaluation process. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.920. The claimant must prove first that she \u201cis not undertaking substantial gainful activity\u201d and second that she has a \u201csevere impairment or combination of impairments.\u201d <em>Doughty, </em>245 F.3d at 1278. \u201cAt step three, if the claimant proves that [her] impairment meets one of the listed impairments found in Appendix 1, [s]he will be considered disabled without consideration of age, education, and work experience.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Otherwise, the claimant must proceed to step four and prove that, based on a residual functional capacity assessment, her impairment prevents her from performing any of her past relevant work. <em>Winschel, </em>631 F.3d at 1178; <em>Doughty, </em>245 F.3d at 1278. At the fifth step, the burden shifts to the Commissioner and the ALJ must then determine if there is other work available in significant numbers in the national economy that the claimant can perform. <em>Doughty, </em>245 F.3d at 1278 &amp; n. 2. In doing so, the ALJ relies on the claimant\u2019s residual functional capacity, age, education, and work experience. <em>Id. </em>If the Commissioner demonstrates that there are jobs that the claimant can perform, the claimant must prove that she is unable to perform those jobs in order to be found disabled. <em>See id. </em>at 1278 n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">Rosario first argues that the ALJ erred by according little weight to the opinions of her treating psychiatrist, Dr. Kimani. Weighing the opinions and findings of treating, examining, and non-examining physicians is an important part of steps four and five of the disability determination process. In reaching a decision the ALJ must specify the weight given to different medical opinions and the reasons for doing so. <em>See Winschel, </em>631 F.3d at 1179. Absent good cause, the ALJ must give substantial or considerable weight to the opinions of treating physicians. <em>Winschel, </em>631 F.3d at 1179. A non-examining physician\u2019s opinion is entitled to little weight if it is contrary to the treating or examining physician\u2019s findings unless good cause is found. <em>See Lamb v. Bowen, </em>847 F.2d 698, 703 (11th Cir.1988); <em>Broughton v. Heckler, </em>776 F.2d 960, 962 (11th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">\u201cGood cause exists when the: (1) treating physician\u2019s opinion was not bolstered by the evidence; (2) evidence supported a contrary finding; or (3) treating physician\u2019s opinion was concluso-ry or inconsistent with the doctor\u2019s own medical records.\u201d <em>Winschel, </em>631 F.3d at 1179 (quotation marks omitted). We have found good cause where, among other things, the treating physician made conclusory statements regarding the claimant\u2019s inability to work without any discussion of why the disability made it impossible for the claimant to be gainfully employed or the nature or permanence of the disability. <em>See Johns v. Bowen, </em>821 F.2d 551, 555 (11th Cir. 1987). When the ALJ disregards a treating physician\u2019s opinion with good cause, she must clearly articulate the reasons for doing so. <em>Winschel, </em>631 F.3d at 1179.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-9\">The ALJ did not err in giving little weight to Dr. Kimani\u2019s opinions that Rosario was unable to work. The ALJ clearly indicated that she gave little weight to Dr. Kimani\u2019s opinions because they were inconsistent with Kimani\u2019s own findings, notes from the treatment plan, and the overall medical evidence. As an example, the ALJ highlighted a medical report in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>which Dr. Kimani concluded that Rosario\u2019s concentration was slightly impaired and that she \u201cmay be able to work in a limited setting.\u201d In the same report Dr. Kimani concluded that Rosario was incapable of sustaining \u201cwork activity for eight hours a day, five days a week.\u201d Dr. Kimani provided no explanation for these seemingly contradictory findings, thereby casting \u201cdoubt\u201d on Rosario\u2019s inability to work. <em>See Edwards v. Sullivan, </em>937 F.2d 580, 583-4 (11th Cir.1991) (holding that there was good cause for the ALJ not to rely on a treating physician\u2019s opinions when there were unexplained, internal inconsistencies). The inconsistency of Dr. Kimani\u2019s opinions with his own findings and the overall medical evidence qualifies as good cause not to give controlling weight to the statements of Rosario\u2019s treating psychiatrist.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">Rosario next argues that the ALJ\u2019s hypothetical questions to the vocational expert did not adequately account for her limitations in concentration, persistence, or pace. One way that the ALJ may prove that other jobs exist for the claimant under step five is by posing hypothetical questions to the vocational expert to \u201cestablish whether someone with the limitations that the ALJ has previously determined that the claimant has will be able to secure employment in the national economy.\u201d <em>Phillips v. Barnhart, </em>357 F.3d 1232, 1240 (11th Cir.2004). \u201cIn order for a vocational expert\u2019s testimony to constitute substantial evidence, the ALJ must pose a hypothetical question which comprises all of the claimant\u2019s impairments.\u201d <em>Wilson v. Barn-hart, </em>284 F.3d 1219, 1227 (11th Cir.2002). Generally, an ALJ does not account for a claimant\u2019s limitations in concentration, persistence, and pace by restricting the hypothetical posed to the vocational expert to simple, routine tasks or unskilled work. <em>See Winschel, </em>631 F.3d at 1180-81. However, if the \u201cmedical evidence demonstrates that [the] claimant can engage in simple, routine tasks or unskilled work despite limitations in concentration, persistence, and pace\u201d then \u201climiting the hypothetical to include only unskilled work sufficiently accounts for such limitations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1180.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">Here, the ALJ\u2019s hypothetical questions adequately accounted for the claimant\u2019s limitations in concentration, persistence, and pace. In step four\u2019s residual functional capacity determination, which reflects the moderate limitations in concentration, persistence, and pace found during steps two and three of the analysis, the ALJ found that the medical evidence demonstrated Rosario\u2019s ability, despite her limitations, to perform simple, routine, and repetitive tasks in an environment with only brief interactions with co-workers and the public. The ALJ pointed to the independent assessments of three doctors in support of this conclusion. Dr. Willens, for example, determined that even though Rosario had moderate difficulties with concentration, persistence, and pace she retained the ability to perform simple and routine tasks for six to eight hours per workday on a sustained basis. The hypothetical the ALJ posed to the vocational expert restricted Rosario to the same type of tasks and thereby sufficiently accounted for Rosario\u2019s limitations in concentration, persistence, and pace. Accordingly, substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s finding that Rosario could perform a significant number of jobs in the national economy.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
