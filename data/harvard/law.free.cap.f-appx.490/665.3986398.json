Juarez-Olvera challenges only the substantive reasonableness of his sentence, arguing that it is greater than necessary to accomplish the sentencing objectives of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>challenges the application of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 in calculating his guidelines range because he asserts that the guideline is not empirically based and overstates his criminal history. Further, he asserts that the district court failed to account for his personal circumstances. Specifically, he notes that he returned to the United States only to make money to support his ill daughters.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\">Although Juarez-Olvera argued for a downward variance, he failed to object to the reasonableness of the sentence imposed. Juarez-Olvera concedes that he failed to object to his sentence after it was imposed and that our review is limited to plain error. Nevertheless, he seeks to preserve for further review his contention that a reasonableness objection on the imposition of sentence is not required for abuse-of-discretion review. As Juarez-Olvera did not object to the reasonableness of his sentence after it was imposed, review is arguably for plain error. <em>See United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391-92 (5th Cir.2007); <em>but see United States v. Flanagan, </em>87 F.3d 121, 124 (5th Cir.1996). We need not determine whether plain error review is appropriate because Juarez-Olvera\u2019s arguments fail even under the abuse-of-discretion standard of review. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>523 F.3d 519, 525 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">The substantive reasonableness of a sentence is reviewed under an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Since Juarez-Olvera\u2019s sentence was within his advisory guidelines range, his sentence is presumptively reasonable. <em>See United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009). Juarez-Olv-era challenges the presumption of reasonableness applied to his sentence but acknowledges the issue is foreclosed and raises it to preserve the issue for further review. <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 366-367 (5th Cir. 2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">We have rejected Juarez-Olvera\u2019s argument that the seriousness of his offense is overstated because U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 is not empirically based. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>660 F.3d 231, 232-33 (5th Cir. 2011); <em>United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-30 (5th Cir.2009). The district court listened to Juarez-Olvera\u2019s arguments for a lesser sentence but found that a sentence within the guidelines range was appropriate. His contentions regarding his mitigating factors and benign motive for reentry do not rebut the presumption of reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Lopez-Velasquez, </em>526 F.3d 804, 807 (5th Cir.2008). Thus, Juarez-Olvera has not showm sufficient reason for us to disturb the presumption of reasonableness applicable to his sentence. <em>See Cooks, </em>589 F.3d at 186.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-8\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b691-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
