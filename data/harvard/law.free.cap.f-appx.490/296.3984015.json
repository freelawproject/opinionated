Williams also challenges the denial of his request for sentencing under the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010, which increased from 5 to 28 grams the minimum amount of cocaine base required to impose a mandatory minimum sentence of five years of imprisonment. We affirm the calculation of Williams\u2019s history category, but the recent decision of the Supreme Court in <em>Dorsey v. United States, </em>567 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 2821, 2881, 183 L.Ed.2d 250 (2012), requires that we vacate Williams\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing consistent with the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-19\">The district court did not err in increasing Williams\u2019s criminal history category for his prior sentence of 115 days of imprisonment for possessing cocaine and possessing less than 20 grams of cannabis. The Sentencing Guidelines provide that \u201c[p]rior sentences under appeal are counted\u201d in computing the criminal history category. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(Z). If Williams succeeds in having his conviction vacated, he may move the district court to set aside or correct his sentence. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255; <em>United States v. Walker, </em>198 F.3d 811, 813-14 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-20\">As the government concedes, the district court erred by failing to sentence Williams under the Fair Sentencing Act. After Williams appealed, the Supreme Court held in <em>Dorsey, </em>132 S.Ct. at 2331, that \u201cCongress intended the ... more lenient penalties [under the Act] to apply to those offenders whose crimes preceded August 3, 2010, but who are sentenced after that date.\u201d Williams was sentenced on February 28, 2011. Williams is entitled to the more lenient penalties provided in the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-21\">We AFFIRM in part the calculation of Williams\u2019s criminal history category, but we VACATE Williams\u2019s sentence and REMAND for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED, AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
