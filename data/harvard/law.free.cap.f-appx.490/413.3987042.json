Still appeals from an order of the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania that dismissed his complaint. We will grant Still\u2019s motion to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>(\u201cIFP\u201d) on appeal, but will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-29\">The first issue we must consider is whether Still is entitled to proceed IFP on appeal. The question turns solely on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>issue of whether Still has shown that he is economically eligible. <em>Gibbs v. Ryan, </em>160 F.3d 160, 161 n. 1 (3d Cir.1998). A person need not be \u201cabsolutely destitute\u201d to proceed IFP, <em>Adkins v. E.I. DuPont de Nem-ours &amp; Co., </em>335 U.S. 331, 339, 69 S.Ct. 85, 93 L.Ed. 43 (1948); however, an affiant must show the inability to pay the fees on appeal, <em>see Walker v. People Express Airlines, Inc., </em>886 F.2d 598, 601 (3d Cir.1989). Still\u2019s affidavit reveals that he and his wife receive disability payments, and that Still receives a small monthly salary from a part-time job. However, it appears that their fixed expenditures come very close to consuming their combined monthly income. Thus, we will grant the motion to proceed IFP.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">The next question we consider is whether the appeal should be dismissed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> or summarily affirmed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Essentially for the reasons stated in the District Court\u2019s opinion, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment. Still alleged in his original, one-page complaint that the Department of Veteran Affairs (\u201cVA\u201d) discriminated against him on the basis of his disability, in violation of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794, when it failed to hire him on two occasions. The Defendants filed a motion to dismiss, and Still filed, among other things, a motion to amend/correct the complaint. The District Court granted the Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss, and noted that Still\u2019s proposed amended complaint did not cure the deficiencies of his original complaint, as he did not: (1) specify what his disability was, (2) state his qualifications for either of the positions for which he applied, (3) \u201cnor point to any circumstances surrounding his non-selection, such as the hiring of a non-disabled applicant, which could raise an inference of discrimination.\u201d However, the District Court granted Still leave to file another amended complaint. Still did so, describing his disability,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> alleging that he was qualified for the positions, and adding a third instance of non-selection, stating that the VA discriminated against him on the basis of retaliation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Defendants once again filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint, or, in the alternative, for summary judgment. After Still responded, the District Court granted the Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss, and dismissed Still\u2019s complaint with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and exercise plenary review over the District Court\u2019s grant of the Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). <em>See Phillips v. County of Allegheny, </em>515 F.3d 224, 230 (3d Cir.2008). We accept as true all of the factual allegations contained in the complaint and draw reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff. <em>See Erickson v. Pardus, </em>551 U.S. 89, 93-94, 127 S.Ct. 2197, 167 L.Ed.2d 1081 (2007) (per curiam). To survive dismissal, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to \u201cstate a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (citing <em>Bell Atlan</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number><em>tic Coup. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">To establish a prima facie case for relief in an employment discrimination case alleging a failure to hire, an applicant must establish that: (1) he belongs to the protected category; (2) he applied for and was qualified for a position for which the covered employer was seeking applicants; (3) despite his qualifications, he was not hired; and (4) after his rejection, the position remained open, or was filled in a manner giving rise to an inference of discrimination. <em>Olson v. General Elec. Astrospace, </em>101 F.Bd 947, 951 (3d Cir.1996). As the District Court pointed out, the plaintiff does not need to establish the elements of a prima facie case in his complaint, \u201cbut instead, need only put forth allegations that raise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal evidence of the necessary element(s).\u201d District Court Opinion, docket #21, at 8 (quoting <em>Fowler v. UPMC Shadyside, </em>578 F.3d 203, 213 (3d Cir.2009)). We agree with the District Court that Still did not meet that requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">On the first occasion where Still was not hired, the VA hired two disabled veterans to fill the positions, thus rebutting any allegation that the agency acted in a discriminatory manner. As to the other two occasions, we agree with the District Court that Still failed to show that the VA acted with any discriminatory or retaliatory motivation. As Still has noted throughout his filings, the VA has a clear policy of favoring disabled veterans and other veterans over nonveterans.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The record shows that two preference-eligible veterans were hired for the second set of openings, and Still did not include any allegations that would show that he was rejected on the third occasion in retaliation for his discrimination complaints. In short, Still did not include any allegations in his complaint that would \u201cnudge\u201d his employment discrimination claims \u201cacross the line from conceivable to plausible.\u201d <em>Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. at 680, 129 S.Ct. 1937.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-12\">For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b440-5\">. Pursuant to that statute, we must dismiss an appeal if we find it to be frivolous or if it fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b440-6\">. We may take summary action where an appeal presents \"no substantial question.\u201d Third Circuit LAR 27.4 and I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b440-9\">. Still alleges that he is disabled because of his heart disease.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b440-10\">. Because we agree with the District Court's conclusion that Still's complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, we need not reach the issue of whether the District Court properly considered the unexhausted retaliation claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b441-7\">. Still has not alleged that the VA's policy of choosing veterans over non-veterans has an effect that discriminates against people with disabilities. Such an argument would be difficult to carry, given the fact that the VA chose disabled veterans to fill the first positions for which Still applied.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
