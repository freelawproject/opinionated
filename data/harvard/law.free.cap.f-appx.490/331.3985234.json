The district court granted a certificate of appealability on the following two issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-26\">(1) Whether the Alabama court\u2019s decision that Guyton\u2019s right to a public trial under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments was not violated because he \u201cagreed that the courtroom be closed\u201d was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States or was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-27\">(2) Whether the Alabama courts\u2019 decision that Guyton\u2019s counsel did not ren<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>der ineffective assistance in violation of the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments by expressly agreeing to the full closure of the courtroom for all testimony was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal Law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States or was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">We review the district court\u2019s grant or denial of a habeas corpus petition <em>de novo. Guzman v. Sec\u2019y, Dept. of Corrections, </em>663 F.3d 1336, 1345 (11th Cir.2011). Federal petitions filed by state prisoners after April 24, 1996, are governed by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. <em>Guzman, </em>663 F.3d at 1345. A state court\u2019s factual conclusions are presumed to be correct, and may only be corrected on a showing of clear and convincing evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 1346; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1). The district court\u2019s factual findings are reviewed for clear error, and mixed questions of law and fact are reviewed <em>de novo. Ward v. Hall, </em>592 F.3d 1144, 1155 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 647, 178 L.Ed.2d 513 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">In order to grant a habeas petition, we must conclude that the petitioner\u2019s constitutional claims are meritorious, and that the state court\u2019s resolution of those claims:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-9\">(1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-10\">(2) resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-11\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d); <em>see also Guzman, </em>663 F.3d at 1345-46.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-12\">A state court\u2019s decision is contrary to clearly established federal law if the state court (1) applies a legal rule contradictory to Supreme Court precedent or, (2) confronted with materially indistinguishable facts from the Supreme Court, arrives at a different result. <em>Guzman, </em>663 F.3d at 1346. A state court\u2019s decision is a reasonable application of clearly established law where, at a minimum, \u201cfairminded jurists could disagree\u201d on the correctness of the decision. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b358-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-14\">The Sixth Amendment guarantees criminal defendants the right to a public trial. U.S. Const, amend. VI. That right is extended to defendants in state prosecutions through the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>See Waller v. Georgia, </em>467 U.S. 39, 40-41, 104 S.Ct. 2210, 2212, 81 L.Ed.2d 31 (1984). The Supreme Court has recognized that a contempt defendant waives his due process right to a public trial where he does not object to a closed courtroom. <em>Levine v. United States, </em>362 U.S. 610, 618-19, 80 S.Ct. 1038, 1043-44, 4 L.Ed.2d 989 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-15\">The state court found that Guyton, through his counsel, affirmatively consented to the courtroom\u2019s closure. The record does not contradict that finding, and we presume it to be correct. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1). No clearly established Supreme Court precedent holds that a defendant cannot waive the right to a public trial, nor that the court must balance the interests of closure absent an objection. Accordingly, it was not contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law for the state court to conclude that it had not violated Guyton\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-16\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-17\">An ineffective assistance of counsel claim in a habeas petition is a mixed ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>tion of law and fact subject to <em>de novo </em>review. <em>Ward, </em>592 F.3d at 1155.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">In order to make out an ineffective assistance claim, the court must conclude if the alleged conduct was \u201coutside the wide range of professionally competent assistance.\u201d <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 690, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2066, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Counsel is strongly presumed to have given adequate assistance. <em>Id. </em>at 689, 104 S.Ct. at 2065. Further, the reasonableness of a counsel\u2019s actions may be determined based on the defendant\u2019s statements or actions. <em>Id. </em>at 691, 104 S.Ct. at 2066.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">Once a defendant consents, at the outset of a criminal proceeding, to be represented by counsel, the counsel has the power to make binding strategic decisions in many areas. <em>Faretta v. California, </em>422 U.S. 806, 820-21, 95 S.Ct. 2525, 2533-34, 45 L.Ed.2d 562 (1975). Certain fundamental rights, however, cannot be waived by counsel without the express, knowing and voluntary consent of the defendant. <em>See Jones v. Barnes, </em>463 U.S. 745, 751, 103 S.Ct. 3308, 3312, 77 L.Ed.2d 987 (1983) (identifying the fundamental rights that could not be waived by counsel as \u201cwhether to plead guilty, waive a jury, testify in his or her own behalf, or take an appeal_\u201d). The Supreme Court has not held that counsel cannot waive his client\u2019s right to a public trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-9\">Structural defects, such as the closing of a trial to the public, are presumed to be prejudicial when raised on direct appeal. <em>See Arizona v. Fulminante, </em>499 U.S. 279, 309-11, 111 S.Ct. 1246, 1264-65, 113 L.Ed.2d 302 (1991). However, the Supreme Court has identified only three scenarios in which ineffective assistance of counsel is presumed to be prejudicial on collateral review: (1) an actual or constructive denial of counsel altogether; (2) state interference with counsel\u2019s assistance; and (3) where counsel has an actual conflict of interest. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 691-92, 104 S.Ct. at 2066-67. Absent those circumstances, a habeas petitioner must demonstrate that the ineffective assistance had an effect on the judgment. <em>Id. </em>at 691-93, 104 S.Ct. at 2066-67. Applying <em>Strickland, </em>we have held that, even when dealing with structural error, a habe-as petitioner must show actual prejudice when advancing an ineffective assistance claim. <em>Purvis v. Crosby, </em>451 F.3d 734, 743 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-12\">The state court found that Guyton\u2019s counsel consented to closure in Guyton\u2019s presence, and that Guyton acquiesced. Even though Guyton has denied giving his approval, the record does not refute the state court finding. With that factual finding, it was not ineffective assistance for Guyton\u2019s counsel to consent to the closure. Further, there is no clearly established federal law stating that counsel cannot waive the right to a public trial as a strategy decision without his client\u2019s consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-13\">Even if he met the first part of the ineffective assistance inquiry under <em>Strickland, </em>Guyton has failed to demonstrate any resulting actual prejudice. <em>See Pur-vis, </em>451 F.3d at 743. As a result, it was not contrary to, nor an unreasonable application of, federal law, or the facts, for the state court to conclude that Guyton failed to establish ineffective assistance of counsel. Accordingly, the district court did not err in denying Guyton\u2019s habeas petition, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-14\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b359-10\">.
