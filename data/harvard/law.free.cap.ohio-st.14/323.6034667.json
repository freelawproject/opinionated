The same material facts are common to all the cases, and all will be considered together.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b280-12\">The facts material to the decision of these cases are, in substance, these:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b280-13\">One Archelaus Moon died in 1796, possessed of four Virginia military land warrants, Nos. 5,703, 5,704, 5,705, 5,706.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b280-14\">He had two sets of children.

Moon (as recited in tho assignment), ^assigned these warrants to one Price, who assigned the same to Joseph Kerr.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b280-16\">Kerr, claiming to be the sole owner of these warrants, contracted with the complainants to soil the lands in dispute, and secure the title by taking the steps required to procure patents.

This case is reported \u2014 Kerr <em>v. </em>Moon, 9 Wheat. 566. The cause was then remanded for further proceedings, and finally a decree was had in the circuit court of the United States in 1827, that Kerr, by proper assurances, should assign, transfer, and convey to said Moon\u2019s devises said warrants, and all locations, entries, surveys, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>lands, and interests in lands acquired under the same. Kerr never, in any respect, executed said decree; nor did such decree, of itself, it is conceded, operate as a conveyance or transfer of title under our statute. In 1829, the devisees of Moon, under this decree, had partition of the lands among themselves, and proceeded to make sales.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b282-5\">Trimble, the present respondent, became a purchaser, but the present complainants having the legal title, refused to give possession. Kerr, in the meantime, died; the decree of said United States circuit court being unexecuted by him, and no effort was made either to carry said decree into execution, or to revive the same, until the year 1839.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b282-6\">In the year 1839, by leave of court, and by consent of parties, Trimble was permitted to file a bill of revivor, and a supplemental bill, in said circuit court, against Kerr\u2019s heirs ; and by consent a decree was rendered against them, and,'under said decree, conveyances of the lands in dispute were made to Trimble in 1840.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b282-7\">In view of these facts, the decree, sought to be reversed was rendered against complainants, in favor of Trimble. It was supposed that complainants having perfected their legal titles, after suit in 1812, in the circuit court, by Moon\u2019s devisees, under whom Trimble holds, and decree against Kerr, that the doctrine of <em>lis pendens </em>would operate to entitle Trimble to the legal titles so acquired.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"Ahl\">. *John Jollieee and J.

Trabue\u2019s Heirs, 1 McLean, 88, McLean, J., held, that persons who enter into the possession under tenants, on whom a notice has been served in ejectment, will be subject to be turned out of possession under the judgment. <em>\u201cBut this rule is not without limitation.'1'' </em>That the judgment fixes the right of entry, but without an actual entry the statute of limitations will continue to operate against the right. And after the lapse of eleven years, being four years more than the limitation fixed by the statute, a writ of possession was quashed, and a writ of restitution awarded, to give the tenant an opportunity of setting up a right under the statute.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b285-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>In Ledgerwood et al. <em>v. </em>Picket\u2019s Heirs, 1 McLean, 143, a demise in an action of ejectment was amended, the term extended, and a writ of possession was taken out, under which the <em>terre tenants </em>were about to be turned out of possession without notice. On writ of error <em>coram vobis, </em>Judge McLean decided that \u201c it is very clear that such a power should not be exercised except on notice to all persons <em>whose interest may be affected by the </em>amendment.\u201d He said that, \u201cin this summary way, \u2018the rights of no individual should be prejudiced without notice, and an <em>ample </em>opportunity given of showing cause why *the amendment should not be granted. Indeed, it is manifest, from the facts in this case, that great injustice will be done unless this writ of possession shall be set aside.\u201d S. C., 7 Pet. 144.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b285-5\">The cases in 1 McLean decide the proposition that the statute of limitation runs in favor of a <em>pendente lite </em>purchaser. It runs in favor of the defendant in ejectment himself. 1 McLean, 88. McLean, J.,says: \u201cA mere <em>entry </em>while the tenantremains in possession, will not hurt him; he must be turned out of possession, or acknowledge the right of the lessor of the plaintiff, by consenting to hold under him. Nothing short of this will stop the statute.\u201d See also 8 Ohio, 167, 168; Smith <em>v. </em>Hornback, 4 Lit. 233.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b285-6\">The case of Baldwin <em>v. </em>Love, 2 J. J. Marsh. 489, is opposite to the present. There the purchaser had obtained the property in question, after the filing of the original bill. The complainants amended their.Ijfll, but the order of amendment was not noted in the order book as a statute of Kentucky required. The court held that, \u201c under these circumstances, if it was designed to impeach Morton\u2019s (the purchaser\u2019s) title to the slaves, he should have <em>been made a party to the suit,\" </em>and reversed the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b285-7\">In Sale <em>v. </em>Crompton, 2 Stra. 194, \u201ca warrant of attorney was given in 1732, to confess a judgment for <em>Crompton, </em>but the record of the judgment, had left out the <em>r, </em>and it was made <em>Compton, </em>and now the court refused to amend it by the warrant, <em>for fear of inconveniences to the purchasers.\" </em>Equity looks at the <em>substance, </em>and not at the <em>form </em>of things. The reversal of the case because, by the complainant\u2019s own showing on the bill, they had no right to sue, was substantially as much as a nonsuit at law, or an abatement in chancery.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b285-8\">If, in such case, the complainants had sued at law, they would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>have been nonsuited, or had judgment against them. The case was reversed by the Supreme Court of the United States, on the ground that before they proved the will in Ohio, the complainants had <em>no right to sue </em>or intermeddle with the ^effects of the testator in Ohio. Here, then, is a clear case of a party suing when he had no right at all to sue.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b286-5\">In Bishop of Winchester v. Beaver, 3 Ves.

And the fact that the court was setting within the limits of our own state, can not give the plaintiff any better claim than he would have had if *the judgment had been rendered in any other state or territory of the United States.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b286-13-pl-split\">In 2 Story\u2019s Eq., sec. 405, it is said : \u201c It is upon similar grounds that every man is presumed to be attentive to what passes in the courts of justice of the <em>state or sovereignty where he resides; </em>and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>therefore, a purchase made of property actually in litigation, pendente,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b287-5\">\u201cThe state tribunals are no part of the government of the United States.\u201d Rawle on the Constitution, 200, quoted with approbation by Judge Story, in 3 Story on the Constitution, 448, note 2.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b287-6\">A bill of exchange, drawn in one state of this Union, on a person in another state, is a foreign bill, 10 Ohio, 185; 10 Pet. 579; 12 Pet. 54; where it is decided that \u201cthe respective states are sovereign within their own limits,-and foreign to each other, regarding them as local governments.\u201d 2 Pet. 586 ; 1 lb. 179.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b287-7\">The complainants then ought to be no more affected by these proceedings than if they had taken place in the state courts of Maine, or Now Hampshire, or in the courts of the United States for Louisiana or Florida.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b287-8\">The rule that a <em>lis pendens </em>is notice to the world, <em>applies only where the suit is brought in the county where the land is situated. </em>And, with that limitation, a purchaser, with reasonable diligence, can know whether the title he is purchasing is in litigation or not. Once compel a purchaser to go beyond the county in searching for suits, and there is no limit to the extent of his liability.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b287-9\">The party who claims the benefit of a <em>Us pendens, </em>by which the other party has been deprived of the right of <em>being heard </em>in a court whose aid is sought to wrest from him his possession, must clearly show that such <em>lis pendens </em>exists. Although the defendant has the aid of able and diligent counsel, they have not produced a <em>single case </em>where, either by decision or dicta, the doctrine they now contend for has been held. And, to adopt the language of Judge Lane, in 5 Ohio, 193, \u201c <em>it is *an argument of irresistible force that, in the whole range of authority within our reach, not one has been found </em>\u201d to support the principle claimed by the defendant\u2019s counsel.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b287-10\">In the case in 6 Ohio, 463, the court thought it to be material that \u201cno settled practice furnishes evidence that the profession have deemed it necessary \u201d that the decree should be recorded in the registry of deeds.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b287-11\">A <em>Us pendens </em>is not notice to postpone a prior registered conveyance. This point was directly decided in Newman <em>v. </em>Chapman, 2 Rand. 93, where it was held that a <em>Us pendens </em>of an unregistered mortgage was not notice to postpone to it a recorded deed.

The <em>will </em>under which the defendant claims, has never, I believe, been recorded in Highland county; at least I do not remember any such fact in the case. The statute of Ohio (Chase, 572, sec. 12; 681, sec. 12). requires the copy of a foreign will to be recorded in the county where \u201csuch estate shall lie,\u201d A purchaser for valuable consideration from an heir, without notice of a will, will be protected in equity.

They had the actual, adverse, notorious, and exclusive possession of the land upward of, twenty-one years before the commencement of these suits in Highland county. The rendering of a judgment in ejectment, without dispossessing the tenant, does not deprive him of the benefit of the statute of limitations. See 1 McLean, 2 Litt., and 8 Ohio, before referred to.</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A3I\">*The demand is a stale one. \u201cEquity will not aid a stale demand, where the party has slept upon his rights, and acquiesced for a great length of time.\u201d Bowman\u2019s Devisees et al. <em>v. </em>Wathen et al., 2 McLean, 396, and the cases there collected.

Time here, in these matters, is of far greater importance than there; and hence, delays indulged in by the English courts afford no warrant in principle for similar delays in Ohio. Sixty years there, is the ultimate limitation for real actions ; twenty-one years in Ohio. And this difference affords a fair rule for adjusting the differences in time between the two countries, in cases of chancery.

There was no other mode of carrying that decree into execution than the one adopted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A6s\">. *Had Trimble, as assignee of some of Moon\u2019s devisees, the right.to file the supplemental biil, in the nature of a bill of revivor, to carry the original decree into execution? Surely, on this point there can be no doubt; and if there were, this court would hardly be expected, collaterally, to reverse a decree of a court of competent jurisdiction, in executing its own decrees, made in a case of which it had undoubted cognizance. But there is no doubt. Story\u2019s Eq. PI. 281, 343, and authorities there referred to. What, then, is the effect of the proceedings on this supplemental bill, in the nature of a bill of revivor? Do they continue the suit and relate back to the commencement of the original suit, form part of it, and reinstate it in all its bearings; or in law, was the original suit ever out of court? It is insisted, on principle and authority, that the original suit was never abated, and that the last proceedings are incorporated into and constitute a part of it. At law, when one of the parties dies the suit abates; but in equity, the rule is entirely different, and a bill of revivor puts all the parties in the same condition, when filed, as they were in at the happening of the death, and it carries with it the full effect of all the original proceedings. Story\u2019s Eq. PI. 289. In 12-Pet. 171, this point is directly decided; and could there be any doubt of it on general principles, as the court say, in that case the act of Congress regulating the practice of the United States court has proscribed the rule for them; and, having construed it, the point must be considered as sottled. In 11 Ves. 194, 200, the same point is decided. If, then, it be true that all the influences of the original decree are imparted to the subsequent proceedings, which, in point of fact, only ordered such decree to be executed according to the new relations of the parties, and did not change the equities of those litigating in the least par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>fcieular, what effect has such original and amended proceedings on the titles of the .defendants? By the original decree, the equity was found with the complainants, and Kerr was ordered to convey, so as to pass to complainants all the title to all the *lands located under the four warrants, and the three tracts in controversy among others, so as'the same should be assured and warranted to them or their assigns' against himself and all persons claiming under him. Now, did this decree and the one under the last proceedings, which adopted it as part of it, and placed Trimble' in the exact position of Moon\u2019s devisees, destroy, utterly vacate the titles of these complainants ; or are they, in the language of the law, <em>\u201cpendente lite </em>\u201d purchasers, and have acquired nothing by their intermeddling with these titles while in controversy ? The rule of law is, and has been for three centuries, that' he who purchases a title in litigation takes nothing by his purchase, and the parties litigating are not bound to notice him in any way. His title is absolutely <em>void, </em>and passes no right which is not subject to the decree in the suit. Authorities are without number, but one directly in point of this court (deciding that the title of a 11 <em>pendente lite </em>\u201d purchase is <em>void, </em>not voidable) is sufficient. Bennet\u2019s Lessee <em>v. </em>Miah Williams, 5 Ohio, 461.</p>\n<p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b291-5\">In 1 Story\u2019s Eq. 383-386, and 2 lb. 501-503, the rule is clearly defined, and there can be no evading the assertion that a constructive trust must be forced on these parties. Constructive notice in equity can not be evaded, any more than it can be at law, nor can-proof be adduced to destroy it. The most usual illustration is that of a deed registered or recorded, where the law holds the subsequent purchaser bound by it, whether he has ever seen or heard of it; and in these cases, the conclusion in equity is equally fatal for these complainants. They are bound to know and notice all the assignments under which they claim their title, from the patent down to the warrant; and they must abide the exact part of the title, and no more than has been handed down by each transfer. They claim as the assignees of Joseph Kerr, who was the assignee, through R. Price, of J. P. Moon, and G. C. Friend, and Martha, his wife, formerly Martha Moon, who obtained the warrants, and assigned them as aforesaid,-a's the only heirs at law of said A..Moon, deceased. How is this ? *The record \u00e9stablishes that said Josiah P. Moon and Martha Moon, the wife of said George C. Friend, were children of the said A. Moon, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>deceased, by a former marriage, and in the will of said A. Moon were entirely cut off from any part or parcel in these warrants : and it further decrees that they had no right at all to said warrants or surveys made under them ; that their assignment of the same was void; that Price\u2019s to Kerr was void; and, of course, it follows that Kerr'had nothing to \u00e1Ssign, and that his assignment is void. Thus, the whole foundation of the complainants\u2019 titles fall; and inasmuch as through these void assignments they have acquired the legal title to land covered by our warrants, and entries, and surveys, made in the name of Kerr, who is decreed to' be a trustee holding for us, the law charges them with individual notice, and applies to them the rule that whero a party purchases trust property, knowing it to be such, in violation of the objects of the trust, a court of equity forces the trust upon the conscience of the guilty party, and compels him to perform it, and to hold the pi\u2019operty subject to it, in the same manner as the trustee himself held it. All this doctrine, in the fullest extent, has been sustained by this court.

In the last case, the court dismissed Bonner\u2019s bill, filed against Ware et al., for quieting h'is title, on the ground that he was affected and bound by all the recitations in the patent, and must abide the regularity or irregularity of all the assignments, from the warrant down to the patent, and from that to him, although there had been three assignments before the patent issued, and several conveyances after, before the title came to Bonner, and the court go back and find the defect in the very first assignment of the warrant, as we insist they shall do in these cases.</p>\n<p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b292-5\">It has been, and doubtless will be, earnestly urged by the complainants, that as- the original suit seems to have been dormant *for a while before the bill of revivor was filled, the defendants were not <em>pendente lite </em>purchasers \u2014 because, say counsel, the rule is that the suit must be in full life and prosecution before one can be affected by the doctrine of <em>lis pendens. </em>The courts have decided this point in both ways, in the cases in Yesey referred to. There the purchase was made during the abatement of the suit. And there are other authorities to the same point.</p>\n<p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b292-6-pl-split\">But grant the rule to be, as complainants\u2019 counsel will contend <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>it is, how are they to be helped by it? Here is the main defense, and I desire the attention of the court to its entire want of application, even conceding the rule of law to be that the suit must be in full life and vigor. All their authorities heretofore referred to (11 Wend. 456; 4 Cow. 676; 2 Dana, 412; 3 Ohio, 543), all go to establish that, in different states, of cases where a suit is dormant, and a purchase is made during such abatement, the purchaser is not to be considered as a <em>lis pendens </em>purchaser; all of which, for the present argument, is conceded, though the ease from Peters referred to, and the other authorities, are against it. Yet how is the concession to help the defendants ? Is not its whole effect met, and entirely destroyed by one single question, the answer to which is altogether against them, viz: Did any one of these complainants, or those under whom they claim, purchase, acquire, or perfect their title, during the time that the original suit was in abeyance \u2014 from 1827 to 1839? Not one of them. Fix the purchase when they may, at the .time the patents were issued, or when the entries and surveys were made, or even before they, were made, before the suit, still the doctrine of <em>Us pendens </em>sweeps away all their title.

The equitable title to these land warrants was in Moon\u2019s devisees. The complainants were the purchasers from Kerr, without notice of the equitable interest. Being thus in possession, under such purchase, Moon\u2019s devisees commenced suit against Kerr in the circuit court of the United States, to compel an assignment of said warrants, and all entries, locations, surveys, and interests in land acquired under them. Before suit was commenced, Kerr *was the legal holder of these warrants, the complainants purchasers of the land in dispute, in possession, and bad paid the consideration money under contract of sale, binding Kerr to perfect to them the legal title. Moon\u2019s devisees were the owners in equity of said land warrants ; but the legal title to the lands in dispute was in the United States. The complainants, then, had an interest in these lands before suit was brought, and should have been parties to the suit, which was instituted to deprive both Kerr and them of all right to said warrants, and all interest in the lands now in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6-pl-split\">The equities of the complainants then, and of Moon\u2019s devisees, and of Trimble, who claims under them, are equal. But Trimble\u2019s equity is the elder, and therefore better, and must prevail unless the junior equity has protected itself by clothing itself with the legal title. This' the junior equity has done, by patents to the complainants from the United States for the lands in dispute. But this.was done after suit commenced in the circuit court; and hence it is contended that the doctrine of <em>lis pendens </em>will deprive it of that advantage. An innocent purchaser, without notice of an outstanding equity, holding the legal title, will prevail'. But, pending suit to compel the legal title, if a person buy of the trustee, and take the legal title, although having no actual notice of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>outstanding equity, the law charges him with such notice, and forbids him from taking any benefit from such purchase, from a principle of necessity, that the right to the very matter in dispute cg,n not be changed between the commencement and termination of the suit. If this were permitted, the trustee could always defeat the <em>cestui que </em>trust, by divesting himself, when sued, of the legal title. But this doctrine does not apply to persons who had an interest in the subject matter before suit commenced, and who should have been made parties. If such persons are not made parties, they may proceed, having an equity before suit, to clothe themselves with the legal title; because, having an interest before suit commenced, and being necessary parties, and not having been made such, neither equity nor the ^doctrine of <em>Us pendens </em>forbids them to protect themselves by acquiring the legal title. If it did, they would be affected by a suit to which they should have been parties, but were not without a day in court, to present their interest and claim their right. Hence, in such case, persons who should have been made parties, may proceed precisely as' though no such suit existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">In this case the legal title to the lands in dispute was in the United States, and the complainants, by contract of purchase, had acquired an interest in these lands, as far as Kerr was concerned; and, having taken possession, paid the purchase money, and made improvements, Kerr was bound to secure to them the legal title. The lands being unlocated at the time, the contract required Kerr to take all necessary steps, by location, entry, and survey, to procure the title from the United States. This was the understanding of the parties, Kerr then being in possession of these warrants, and having the power to fulfill his contract; hence they acquired not only an equitable interest in the land, but the equitable right to have that land secured by the warrants in Kerr\u2019s possession. In some of the cases now under consideration, tbe title under the contract was completed as far as entry, location, and survey, before said suit in the circuit court; but in others, entry, location, and survey were had after suit, and all the patents were procured after said suit. Thus, it will be perceived that no mere equitable interest was acquired from Kerr after suit was commenced. Hence complainants were not intruders after suit commenced, and they had, therefore, the perfect right to proceed and protect themselves by obtaining the legal title by procuring pat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>ents, and equity will not deprive them of that advantage. It is quite certain that this reasoning is conclusive as to those instances whore the location, entry, and survey were had before suit brought in the circuit court. But counsel contend that in those instances where entry, location, and survey were had after said suit, there is a difference, and that those instances must come within the doctrine of <em>lis pendens; </em>*that the legal title to the warrants was in Kerr, and the. land he contracted to sell, unappropriated and disconnected with said warrants, until after suit. There appears to be some difficulty in this view, but if there is, it operates both ways; because, if these lands were in no sense connected with the warrants before suit brought, the decree for the transfer of the legal title in the warrants could not affect the land; and if it was sought to claim the lands upon the ground that the warrants bad been attached to it after suit, by entry, location, survey, and patent, those facts should have been brought before the court by supplemental bill, and the persons in possession of those lands, prior to such supplemental bill, should have been made parties, but no such thing was done. Hence, in that view,-the decree of the United States court would not deprive them of their land. But these warrants, so far as these purchasers are concerned, can not be viewed as disconnected with these lands ; or rather, these purchasers can not be regarded as having no interest in the warrants. They contracted with Kerr for land: Kerr possessed that which was equivalent to land, and could secure land. The contract was made with Kerr, unquestionably, in reference to these warrants. The possession of land was delivered by Kerr to the purchasers, which was unlocated, and which he had the power to appropriate and receive. He contracted to take the necessary steps to secure these lands. The whole right to them, therefore, and the right to have them appropriated, by the warrants, resulted from the contract. This contract, and purchase of the land, was made before suit in the circuit court. No new contract was made with Kerr, and no new interest was required from him after suitKerr, after the suit, simply proceeded to perfect the equity which existed against him before suit. The contract coupled the warrant with the land, and money having been paid under it, and possession of the land taken, the equitable interest in the warrants was equal to the equity of Moon\u2019s devisees; and, it must be conceded, that if Kerr alone was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343, 344\">*343, 344</page-number>concerned, there would be no doubt as between him and the purchasers; and Whence, if the land is to be claimed by and through Kerr\u2019s acts, Kerr had the power to contract that these acts should go to the benefit,of the purchasers; and hence Moon\u2019s devisees, claiming from Kerr in this manner, should have made these purchasers parties; but it may be said that there might be a secret understanding, or bargain, between Kerr and the contract purchasers, and it could not be discovered who should be parties; but such is not the cas\u00e9; these parties were in possession of these lands ; this was sufficient notice, to all the world, of their rights, if these rights were, in any manner, to be affected by the suit. We can not, therefore, regard the lands and warrants as disconnected, but hold that the contract of sale conferred an equitable right in these lands, as against Kerr, to compel the legal title; and this existing before suit, the legal title acquired afterward will not be disputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">But there is another ground which should have prevented a decree in favor of Trimble, the respondent to this bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">These complainants were in possession of these lands as early as 1806 and 1808, and have been in possession ever since, paid the purchase money, and made valuable improvements. They have been suffered to remain quietly in possession for some thirty or thirty-four years, before suit is brought against them, to deprive them of their lands. Stale equities will not be enforced; when a party, having an equity, neglects to enforce it, for a period which would constitute a bar at law, under the statute of limitations\u2014 in analogy to the statute \u2014 it will also be barred in equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">Decree reversed and cause remanded for hearing.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
