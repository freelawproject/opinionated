The record shows that an interlocutory decree was rendered upon the original bill in July, 1827, under which neither party acted nor took any steps, and tho case was no further noticed on the docket or otherwise, until tho filing the supplemental bill in December, 1839. At that time Kerr\u2019s heirs, the only defendants, came into court by counsel, and admitted that the plaintiff in this action, Trimble, had paid <em>them, after </em>their father\u2019s death, the money directed by tho decree of 1827, and consented to a decree in favor of Trimble <em>(not a party </em>to tho original bill), and, by their attorney, ^executed to him a deed, by virtue of which, Trimble obtained the patent to himself.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-8\">Defendants introduce:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-9\">1.

Thompson and T. L. Hamer, for the plaintiffs:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b100-11\">The patent of Trimble, the lessor of the plaintiff, covers the land in controversy, and entitles him to a recovery, unless there ^is something in the defendants\u2019 testimony which defeats that right. Defendants rely upon their deeds from Joseph Kerr, and upon a patent subsequently issued to Kerr, by the government, which deeds and patent cover the land.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b100-12\">These deeds were made, as the agreed case shows, during the pendency of the suit in the circuit court of the United States, brought by Moore\u2019s heirs and devisees against Kerr, and the defendants are therefore purchasers, <em>pendente lite, </em>according to all the definitions, principles, and decisions to be found in the books. Their deeds arc <em>void </em>\u2014 not voidable \u2014 and they can take nothing under them. The decree of the court in 1827 gave the lands to complainants, and no conveyance to defendants, by Kerr, after the commencement of that suit in 1812, could affect either Moore\u2019s heirs, or Trimble, who claims under them. If there is any one proposition settled, in the laws of this country, more permanently than another, it is this one which leaves a <em>pendente lite </em>purchaser in the samo condition as his vendor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b100-13-pl-split\">The defendants pretend to have had executor\u2019s contracts for these bonds, prior to the commencement of the suit in 1812. There is but one exhibited; but if they were all here, they could'be of no avail to them in an action of ejectment. A court of chancery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>is the only forum where these evidences of title can be examined) and their merits properly adjudicated.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b101-5\">It is further insisted by the defendants, that the legal title is in them, under the patent issued to Kerr, who was dead in 1838, and consequently can not be in the plaintiff, under his patent, issued in 1840. The law of Congress of 1836 transfers the title, in those eases whore patents are issued to dead men, \u201c to the heirs or assigns\u201d of such deceased persons. They claim to be Kerr\u2019s <em>\u201cassigns.\u201d </em>The provisions of this law are too plain to be misunderstood. Where the land has not been sold, the title goes to the heir. Where it has been sold and conveyed by deed, as a general rule, it goes to the vendee. But, in this case, the pretended \u201cassigns\u201d have a <em>void deed-, </em>and of course the title does not vest in them. They are as if *they had <em>no deeds at all. </em>Besides, Kerr receivod the title, <em>if living, </em>when issued by the government, as a trustee for Moore\u2019s heirs, or Trimble, <em>their assignee; </em>and not for himself, his heirs or assigns \u2014 the present defendants. Was the law of Congress intended to enable the \u201c assigns\u201d of a trustee to defraud the real owners out of their property ? Was it intended to enable the parties to a ft-audulont transaction <em>to </em>perfect it? Did Congress moan to place the fraudulent vendees of a trustee of real estate in a bettor condition, alter his death, than they were in during his lifetime? If Kerr liad been living in 1838, when this patent issued, would the title have passed to his grantees (the defendants) through their fraudulent deeds, made pending the suit in the circuit court? No man can for a moment contend for any such doctrine; and it would be strange if his death should jilace them in a superior condition, under this act of Congress.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b101-6\">No; had Kerr been alive in 1838, the legal title would have vested in him, <em>in trust, </em>to be conveyed to Moore\u2019s heirs, under the decree of the circuit court. Being dead, it vested in his heirs, <em>in trust, </em>for the benefit of these parties. Moore\u2019s heirs transferred their claim to Trimble, who had the suit revived in the circuit court, and Kerr\u2019s heirs came in, and under the direction of the court, conveyed to Trimble by deed, which is on file, all the title they had in the lands. Upon this conveyance, Trimble obtained his patent for the land, the government having thus issued two grants for the same soil, both of which are vested .in the lessor of the plaintiff in this action.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b101-7\">In a word, we maintain that the plaintiff must recover in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113, 114\">*113, 114</page-number>action, because he has the legal title : 1. He presents the patent to himself covering the land; 2. His deed from the heirs of Joseph Kerr, to whom the patent of 1838 was issued. Kerr being dead, the law of 1836 casts the title upon his heirs, <em>in trust </em>for Moore\u2019s heirs and devisees, who were the <em>real own\u00e9rs </em>of the land.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b102-4\">The defendants can not succeed at law, because their deeds from Kerr were <em>mad&lt;s pendente </em>lite, and are therefore void. The patent *to Kerr, after his death, can not aid these deeds, nor does the law of Congress cast the legal title upon persons claiming under such deeds, for any purpose, much less for the purpose of defrauding the true owners, of the soil, in gross violation of right and justice, as well as of the solemn decree of the circuit court of the United States.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b102-6\">M.

Penn, for the defendants:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b102-7\">The defendants introduce:</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b102-8\">1.

Defendants contend that the legal title of the land in question absolutely vested in them, by virtue of the patent of Kerr, who was dead, by the provisions of an act of Congress passed in 1836, without which act, the government, by the patent, parted with no title.

The decree of the circuit court of the United States did not operate as a conveyance of the title. Lessee of Shepherd <em>v. </em>Ross, Comm\u2019r., 6 and 7 Ohio, 394.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b102-12\">5. The defendants are not bound by the decree made in 1839, and conveyances bottomed thereon; nor were they divested of their vested title thereby.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b102-13\">1. Because they were not parties to the suit, but should have been made parties to the original, supplemental, and bill of revivor, being then in the actual possession of the land in question, which operated as notice to the complainants.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b102-14\">2. Because Trimble was no party to the original or supplemental bill; and, if he ever had any interest in the land, it was acquired shortly anterior to the decree of 1839, and that ^decree was rendered by the consent of the parties to that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>suit, and predicated on facts conceded by the defendants, who had <em>no </em>interest, legal or equitable, in the land or money which they acknowledged the receipt of from Trimble, who it appears obtained leave and filed the bill of revivor in the names of the original complainants in part, and others who alleged to be heirs of such of the original complainants as are not parties to the bill of revivor. He, Trimble, yielding the consent and admitting the facts, on the part of the complainants, <em>upon which </em>the decree of 1839 was obtained, and that without any proof in the cause of the death of the original complainants, who are alleged to be dead, or proof of those who are alleged in the bill of revivor to be heirs of the deceased, that they were such.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b103-5\">Indeed, it appears strange that there should have been a bill of revivor, or any other proceedings had in court after the death of Joseph Kerr, since it appears that those persons who are alleged to be his heirs (without proof that they were such) were as competent, if willing, to have made the conveyance which they did under the decree of 1839, <em>without that decree, </em>and which would have been equally available without as with that decree.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b103-6\">3. Because the <em>lis pendens </em>could avail none but the party suing.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b103-7\">4. Because the <em>lis pendens </em>should be prosecuted closely and continuously. Sugden\u2019s Yondors, 526, 527, top.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b103-8\">In the present case, it is manifest that they did not prosecute their suit with the unremitted and ceaseless diligence required by law; but have permitted it to remain perfectly dormant, in quiet and undisturbed repose, from the time the decree was rendered, in 1827, until the filing of the bill of revivor, a period upward of twelve years, without urging or offering the slightest apology or excuse for the great lapse of time suffered to transpire.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b103-9\">They do not pretend to account for this gross negligence and lapse of time in the prosecution of their suit, or offer any reason for not conforming to the requisitions of the decree of 1827.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b103-10\">*5. Because there was no suit pending at the time the grant issued to Kerr, whereby the title vested in the defendants. The period between the time when the case was noticed on the record, and the filing of the supplemental and bill of revivor (more than twelve years), the benefit of the <em>lis pendens </em>was lost by lapse of time and gross neglect. 5 Ohio, 461; Murray <em>v. </em>Ballow, 1 Johns. Ch. 5, 6 ; Watson <em>v. </em>Wilson, 2 Dana, 406.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b104-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>Read, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AqH\">The defendants hold under Kerr. Kerr had contracted to sell the land in question. Possession had been taken and consideration money paid prior to 1812, when Moore\u2019s devisees filed their bill in the circuit court of the United States, to compel from Kerr an assignment of tho military land warrants, by virtue-of which the legal title was to be perfected to defendants and those under whom they hold, under said contract of purchase from Kerr. Kerr, in performance of this contract, in 1814 and 1817, executed deeds, with general covenants of warranty, pending said suit. The legal title was still in the United States. In 1827, a decree was rendered in said circuit court of the United States, in favor of'Moore\u2019s devisees. Kerr never complied with said decree, nor was it in any manner enforced prior to 1839. On April 10, 1838, patents for the land in question issued in the name of Joseph Kerr, then deceased</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">The decree in favor of Moore\u2019s devisees and the entire chancery proceeding lay dormant and abated, by the death of Kerr, until 1839, when Trimble, as assignee of Moore\u2019s devisees, was permit\u00ed ed to make himself a party, by supplemental bill and revivor, and obtained a decree, by consent, against Kerr\u2019s heirs; and in compliance with such decree, a conveyance from them to him, and a patent from the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">Two legal questions arise as to the doctrine of <em>lis pendente </em>purchasers ; and the effect of the act of Congress of 1836, concerning patents issuing in the name of deceased persons.</p>\n<p id=\"A91\">* If the interest in these lands, acquired by purchase from Kerr, was to be affected by tho suit of Moore\u2019s devisees \u2014 such interest existing prior to tho commencement of said suit \u2014 the persons so interested should have been made parties. Not having been made parties, it was their right to clothe their equity with the legal title, as though such suit had not existed, and as decided in respect to a like state of facts, at the'term of this court, Barr et al. <em>v. </em>this plaintiff. But it must be observed that the legal title to the warrants had not been divested from Kerr or his heirs, prior to the issuing of the patent for these lands in his name, as the decree of 1827 had not been complied with. At the timo the patent issued in Kerr\u2019s name the suit was not ponding; it had been dormant for many years and had abated by the death of Kerr. And, to authorize the doctrine of <em>Us pendens, </em>as to Kerr\u2019s heirs, the prosecution of the suit must have been close and continuous. Had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>Kerr, then, been in life in 1838, when the patent issued, he would have been clothed with the legal title, which would have inured to the benefit of his grantees, under the general covenants of warranty. To whom else could it inure? Moore\u2019s devisees had nothing but an equity. A'nd, admitting even that the deeds of Kerr, of 1814 and 1817, could not have prevailed against deeds made by Kerr, in compliance with the decree of 1827, in consequence of the doctrine of <em>lis </em>pendens, yet the covenants in said deeds would be in full force and life against Kerr; and, if Kerr should, after such suit had been suffered to become dormant, acquire the legal title, it would inure to his covenantees; because the doctrine of inurement is nothing more than an estoppel, to prevent an eviction which would authorize a suit for breach of covenants \u2014 or, more comprehensively, and by embracing the covenant of seizin \u2014 a performance of covenants by operation of law, instead of resort to action. Kerr, then, could not have evicted these defendants under his patent, because estopped by his covenants. Had he deeded these lands to these defendants in 1838, such deed would have been good as against Moore\u2019s devisees; because, at that time, no suit respecting them was in *elose and continuous prosecution, nor had been since 1837. Hence the covenants of 1814 and 1817, being in life against Kerr, attached at the time of his acquiring the legal title by patent, and have the same force and effect of a deed, with covenants of general warranty, if then, for the first time, made. Hence, the legal title in 1838 was in these defendants ; and if Moore\u2019s devisees, or Trimble, their assignee, held the equity, they would be compelled to make them parties, to compel legal title, if Kerr had been in life. Does the death of Kerr, at the time the patent issued, make any difference? As between Kerr\u2019s heirs and these defendants, there is no question but the act of Congress of 1836 vests the legal title, by the patent, in these defendants; how does Trimble, the assignee of Moore\u2019s devisees, claim that it does not? Upon the principle that a continuous suit was in prosecution against Kerr, and that they had a right to a decree against his heirs, and that these defendants thrust themselves in, and, if permitted to hold, would defeat the object of the original suit. The answer to this is two-fold: that the suit was not a suit in close continuous prosecution, at the time the legal title was vested in these defendants, nor at the time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>of the commencement of the suit had Kerr the legal title; and that the bill sought no such relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">The act of Congress, then, in no sense can vest Kerr\u2019s heirs \u25a0with the legal title, nor does it execute a simple trust; but divests the legal title conferred by the patent, in the channel of inheritance or purchase. If not, the effect of the law would have been to invest Moore\u2019s devisees, or Trimble, their assignee, with the legal title; and there would have been no need to have revived the suit against Kerr\u2019s heirs. But it is only claimed that the law conferred the legal title upon Kerr\u2019s hi irs for the benefit ofMoore\u2019s devisees or their assignee. But the inheritance of Kerr\u2019s heirs was cut off by the deeds of their ancestor.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">Thus the legal title was in the defendants, by virtue of the deeds of Kerr and patent, before Trimble obtained deeds from *Kerr\u2019s heirs, and patent for himself; and if Trimble, the plaintiff, have any remedy, it is in equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">Judgment for defendants.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
