And if said Eliza Ann shall die within the lifetime of the said William, then, at her death, the said trustee shall pay, transfer, and convoy the same to the child or children of the said Eliza Ann, and their legal representatives, and their heirs and assigns forever. But if thero be no child, or children, or their representatives, then\u201d over to his brother and sister.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b326-5\">Mrs. Brewster died before her brother, leaving two small children, upon whom the testator\u2019s bequest took effect, at his death. Within less than a year, both children died. Meanwhile William Brewster had married again, and at the death *of the last of Mrs. E. A. Brewster\u2019s children, had another child by the second marriage. The question arising is, who is heir to Mrs. E. A. Brewster\u2019s child ? Does the property bequeathed by D. M. Benedict to his sister\u2019s children, pass, by our statutes of descent, to his own brothers and sisters, or to the half-blood brothers of the children? In a more general term, is property, acquired by devise from an uncle, ancestral or non-ancestral?</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b326-6\">No sentiment is more deeply imbedded in the heart of man than that which ascribes an inheritable character to property. The human race has rejected that abstraction of the schools, which Blackstonc and the social compact theorists and certain philosophers profess to believe, that the right of succession to property has no other basis than positive law. For, notwithstanding occasional exceptions, where feudalism or despotism has grasped the children\u2019s bread, no nation has been found so barbarous as not to admit and assert that the property of a decedent belongs, of <em>right, </em>to the kin-folk of his blood, and not to the stranger of his house.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b326-7-pl-split\">This principle of succession has over obtained with the Teutonic race; and all its branches, Norman and Saxon, have united in leaving new acquisitions to distribution among general heirs, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>but in limiting what was acquired by inheritance to the line from which it came. Our statutes of descent conform to, and carry out, this abiding and almost instinctive sentiment, and provide that property, which came not by descent, devise, or gift, shall pass to the heirs general; and that property, acquired by descent, devise, or gift, from an ancestor, shall be transmitted to the heirs of his blood. The distinct object of these provisions is to render property, acquired by descent, or gift, or devise, in consideration of blood, and for no, pecuniary equivalent, ancestral.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b327-5\">This obvious result admits no escape, except by maintaining: 1. That the uncle and devisor of the decedent, is not his ancestor, within the meaning of the law. 2. Inferring the descent of \u25a0the decedent\u2019s estate is consequently controlled by the alternative statute.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b327-6\">*Now, any construction which bestows D. M. Benedict\u2019s property, so carefully limited by his will to his brother and sisters, upon utter strangers to his blood and name, <em>we know </em>to be contrary to his intention, conflicting with our sense of right, and opposed to the spirit of our system of descents ; and we call, with no light faith, upon the court to struggle against such a result.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b327-7\">The legislature doubtless intended that all eases of descent should fall within the two statutes, so that this inheritance is governed by one or by the other. If the plaintiff insist on limiting the word <em>ancestor, </em>in the first, to its narrowest meaning of lineal ancestor, and thus exclude this property from its operation, because it came to the decedent from no lineal ancestor, we reply, with stronger cogency, that the second does not govern it, because it <em>did </em>come by devise.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b327-8\">But the business of the court is to make both statutes harmonious. We assume that property, descending from, or devised by, an uncle, is ancestral estate. \u25a0 The same rules attach to devises as to descents; and the court will observe that, in this case, the nephews of D. M. Benedict are his heirs as well as devisees.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b327-9\">We lay down the proposition, that all property which a decedent has acquired by descent is ancestral. This doctrine depends upon the legal fiction of representation, by which all descendants of a lineal ancestor are referred to him, and all inheritances traced through him, are, by this figment, supposed to come from him.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b327-10\">2 Black. 226, explains this: \u201cNow, here it must be observed, that the lineal ancestors, though according to the first rule, inca-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>pable themselves of succeeding to the estate, because it is supposed to have passed through them, are yet the common stock from whom the next successor must 'spring. And, therefore, in the Jewish law, which, in this respect, entirely corresponds with ours, the father or lineal ancestor is said to be the heir, though long since dead, as being represented by the persons of his issue, who are held to succeed, not in *their own right, as brethren, uncles, etc., but in right of-representation, as the offspring of the father, grandfather,\u201d etc. I do not pursue tlje quotation, but further and fuller explanations may be found on that page and, throughout the chapter. But for this cause, lands are said to <em>descend </em>from collateral kindred, as from one brother to another, or <em>even from a son to an uncle, </em>because the land comes to them <em>through </em>and per consequence, <em>by </em>and <em>from </em>the common ancestor, and thus is holden to descend from such ancestor, and therefore is ancestral land. \u201c Collateral descent is that which takes place to persons who spring out of the side of the whole blood, as another branch thereof, such as grandfather\u2019s brother, father\u2019s brother, and so downward.\u201d Ins. 10, 11. \u201cTherefore, if a man purchases land in fee simple, and dies without issue, for default of the right line, he who is next of kin of the collateral line, comes in <em>by.descent, </em>as heir from him. Lit. sec. <em>2; </em>1 Tern, 415; 3 Rep. 40.\u201d Note to Chitty\u2019s Blackstone, N. T. Rd., 1827.</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b328-5\">Our statute attaches the same ancestral quality to lands devised. Lands devised by a parent to his child are by this rule ancestral. So the uncle, limiting property in the line of succession, first, to his-sister, who is his heir apparent; next, to her children, who stand in the next rank; and\u2019 lastly, over to other children, still following the ordinary course of descent, does not divest his land of its ancestral character, but transmits it to the taker, with its inheritable qualities attached to it. If the land had been given by the uncle to the nephew, and the nephew had died before the uncle, without children, the statute would have restored it. to the uncle, as ancestral, by <em>inheritance, </em>and it would not have gone out of his family to a half-blood brother or entire stranger.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b328-6-pl-split\">These cases show that the legislature did not mean to employ this word <em>ancestor </em>in its narrowest literal meaning, but used it as synonymous with kindred. They likewise show the spirit of the system can be preserved in no other mode than by regarding all property ancestral which is acquired through consideration of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382, 383\">*382, 383</page-number>blood or relationship, whether in the shape of gift, devise, or descent.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b329-4\">*Hitchcock, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A5L\">The object of the parties in this case seems to be to obtain a judicial construction of the fourth clause of the will of David E. Benedict, which has become necessary in consequence of the death of Eliza Ann Brewster, and her two children, Platt B. and William D. The complainant, in the original bill, claims that he is entitled to the estate devised to the two latter, as their father; and the complainant, in the cross:biIl, claims that he is entitled to the same estate, as their half brother. The defendant, Jonas B. Benedict, claims the same estate, both under the will and by virtue of the statute of Ohio regulating descents and the distribution of personal estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">A preliminary question is made, whether under this will the estate devised is to be considered as real or personal. We admit the doctrine that where, by the direction of a will, real estate is to be disposed of and converted into money, a court of equity will consider it as money. But there is nothing in this will to show that such was the intention of the testator. On the contrary, the testator devises his estate, \u201cboth real and personal,\u201d to, or in trust for, his devisees. He does not, in positive terms, direct it to be sold, but if it should be sold, he directs in what manner the avails shall be invested.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">Another question is raised as to whether the law of Connecticut or of Ohio is to govern in the decision of the particular question submitted to the court. To a very considerable extent, the construction of the will must depend upon the law of Connecticut. But when it is considered that the devisees and legatees are all in Ohio ; that the trustee is in Ohio ; that the property itself, so. far as it can be done, is to be, and actually has been, transmitted to Ohio; when a question arises as to the distribution of that property thus transmitted, and where it is not controlled by the will that question must be'settled according to the laws of Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">The intention of the testator is apparent upon this will. That intention was, to distribute his estate, in equal parts to *his sisters and brother, reserving the use of one-fourth part to his father and mother during their joint lives, and the life of the survivor. And it is equally apparent that it was his intention, in the event of the death of either of his sisters, and their children, with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>out issue, that the portion of the estate allotted to such deceased sister should be equally divided between the remaining brother and sister; or in case of their death, then between their children, taking <em>per stirpes. </em>It did not enter into his mind that, by his will, any part of his estate was to go to strangers. Now is this intention to be defeated by any rule cf construction heretofore adopted ? And here I must be permitted to say that these rules, in most cases, are applied, not for the purpose of ascertaining, but of defeating the intention of a devisor or testator. In this state, however, we are required by statute to carry out this intention ; and I presume no such statute would have been passed had it not been supposed that these antiquated rules of construction were too much regarded by our courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">The clause in controversy in the will of David M. Benedict is the fourth. By this clause, one-fourth of the estate is devised to Joseph B. Benedict, in trust for Eliza Ann- Brewster, and it provides that, if the said Eliza Ann shall survive her husband, then, at his death, the trustee is to convey the pi\u2019operty to her, and to her heirs and assigns, to bo hers absolutely. But if she shall die before her husband, then the said trustee is required to transfer and convey the same property \u201c to the child or children of the said Eliza Ann, and their legal representatives, and their heirs and assigns forever ;\u201d and if there were no such children, qr representatives, then the said fourth part of the estate was to be equally divided between Jonas B. Benedict and Clarissa Gallup, if then living.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">Eliza Ann died before the testator, leaving her two children, Platt B. and William D., who were both living at the death of the testator, but who died within eighteen months thereafter. Now, had these children, as well as their mother, died before the testator, I suppose there is no controversy but that Jonas *B. Benedict and Clarissa Gallup would have taken the estate. But it is contended that, inasmuch as the children were living at the time, they took the estate in fee simple, and that, having died without issue, it must go either to the father, according to the law of Connecticut, or to the half-brother, according to the law of descents and distribution of Ohio. This, surely, is not according to the intention of the testator. He did not intend that his estate should, under his will, bo transmitted to those who were not of his own blood.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>But suppose the children of Eliza Ann Brewster did take an estate in fee simple, and the will of the testator can have no further effect to control property, but that the same must be distributed according to the statute regulating descents, how stands the case ?</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">This statute (Swan\u2019s Stat. 286) provides, \u201cthat when any person shall shall die intestate, having title or right to any real estate of inheritance in this state, which title shall have come to such intestate by descent, devise, or deed of gift from any ancestor, such estate shall descend and pass in parcenary to his or her kindr'ed, as follows : First, to the children of such intestate, or their legal representatives; if there- be no children, or their representatives, then to tho brothers and sisters of the intestate, who may be of the blood of the ancestor from whom tho estate came, or their legal representatives, whether such brother and sisters be of the whole or of the half-blood of the intestate.\u201d If the estate came not by descent, devise, or deed of gift, the provision is, that it shall descend, first, to the children, and their legal representatives ; in failure of these, then to the brothers .and sisters of the full blood, and their representatives ; in failure of these, then to the brothers and sisters of the half-blood.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">Now, is it the intention of this statute that, if the estate came to the intestate by descent from a brother or uncle, it shall descend, in the event of the failure of children, and of brothers or sisters of the full blood, to those brothers and sisters of the half-blood, but who are not of the blood of the *person from whom the intestate inherited ? Does it intend that an estate thus acquired, by descent, shall be governed by the same rules as if an original estate, acquired by the intestate by deed or devise from a ,person not in the line of inheritance? Must the estate have descended lineally, or have been devised by one in the direct -descending line, in order that it may not descend to those who are not of the blood of him from whom it came ? We do not so understand the law, or such to have been the intention of the legislature. True, the word <em>ancestor </em>is made use of; and by ancestor we understand, in common parlance, one from whom a person lineally descended. But this word must be taken in connection with tho whole subject matter of the act or instrument in which it is used.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">In this act, relative to descents and the distribution of personal estates, the legislature seem to have divided the property of which a man might die seized into two classes or two divisions, to wit, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>such as camo to him in the regular course of descent, including such as may have been devised to him, or which may have been conveyed to him by deed of gift, but which he would have inherited had there been no such devise or deed of gift, and such as he may have acquired by his own industry, or by the devise or deed of gift from a person to whom he could' not have inherited in the regular line, either lineal or collateral. In the first class of cases, the blood of the person from whom the estate came is to be regarded in the distribution ; in the last, the blood of the intestate. That such was the intention, it seems to us there can be no doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">, Then apply the statute, thus understood, to the case before the court. The children of Eliza Ann Brewster would have inherited this property had it not been devised to them by their uncle, David M. Benedict; and in that case, upon their death without issue, the brother and sisters of the testator would have been their heirs, to whom the property must have descended, excluding a brother or sister of the half-blood of said children, but not of the blood of the testator; so that whether this estate is to be governed by the manifest intention-*of the testator, as expressed in his will, or by the statute of descent, the result is the same. In either event, neither the complainant in the original bill nor the complainant in the cross-bill have any right to this property, and both bills must be dismissed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b332-6\">Wood, C.
