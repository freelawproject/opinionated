Eastman, two of the defendants, executed a mortgage deed to the State of Ohio, to secure the payment of $1,000 and interest thereon, borrowed of the fund commissioners of the county of Ashtabula, under the act of March 28, 1837, for the distribution of the surplus revenue.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b438-9\">At the April term of the court of common pleas of said county, 1842, said term commencing on the 10th day of the month, complainants recovered a judgment against Horace Luce, Joseph Eastman, and Almon E. Eastman, for $1,474.37, with costs. This judgment was obtained by confession, and actually entered on April 20, 1842. One other judgment was entered at the same term of the court, against the same defendants, and the creditors in said judgment are made defendants. These creditors are Ralph Clark, Sidney Smith, and Enos P. Clarke,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b438-10\">On April 7, 1842, Horace Luce and Joseph P. Eastman, with their wives, executed a mortgage to Horace H. Eastman, who is also made defendant, to secure the payment of $2,300.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b438-11\">This mortgage was left at the recorder\u2019s office for record, on the 12th, and actually recorded-on the 14th of April.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b438-12\">The prayer of the bill is for general relief.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AvO\">*J.

Eastman:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b439-7\">The question to be settled in this case is, who has the preferable lien, the judgment or the mortgage ereditor ? We contend that the mortgage is to be preferred :</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b439-8\">1. Because an unrecorded mortgage is preferred in equity, when of an older date, to a judgment lien.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b439-9\">This <em>precise </em>question has never been decided in any reported case ; but questions have been, which, in <em>principle, </em>settle the proposition as we have stated it. 1 Pet. 386 ; Bank of Muskingum <em>v. </em>Carpenter\u2019s Adm\u2019rs, 7 Ohio, 21, pt. 1; Manly <em>v. </em>Hunt, 1 Ohio, 257 ; Barr <em>v. </em>Hatch, 3 Ohio, 527 ; Patterson <em>v. </em>Johnson, 7 Ohio, 225, pt. 1; Norton <em>v. </em>Beaver, 5 Ohio, 178; Lake <em>v. </em>Doud, 10 Ohio; 2 Binn. 48; 1 Johns.

This mortgage being executed and delivered before the term of the court commenced, and being recorded before the judgment was rendered, when so recorded, relates back to the execution, and takes effect from that time by the ^doctrine of re\u00edation.

A judgment rendered by confession can not so relate back to the first day of the term as to cut out the rights of third persons, <em>bona fide </em>acquired between the first day of the term and the-rendition of the judgment.

They were all based upon the well-known principles of chancery jurisdiction, viz., fraud, <em>trust, </em>and <em>accident. </em>None of them depended upon the construction o\u00ed our statutes, and in this respect are clearly distinguishable from those in 3, 8, and 13 Ohio, cited by us.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b440-5\">The doctrine of relation will not avail the defendant. The doctrine of relation exists only between th.e immediate parties to the , transaction, and is intended to prevent, not to promote injustice. Hood <em>v. </em>Brown, <em>2 </em>Ohio, 357; 4 Kent\u2019s Com. 338; Barr <em>v. </em>Hatch, 3 Ohio, 527.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AVo0\">*The statute leaves no room for the doctrine of relation in cases of this desci\u2019iption.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b440-7\">Neither is the third point well taken by the defendant\u2019s counsel. The lien, and the commencement of the lien, are fixed by statute. Judgment liens are the creatures of the statute; they take effect by force of statute, and not by fiction. Riddle <em>v. </em>Bryan, 5 Ohio, 48; McCormick <em>v. </em>Alexander, 2 Ohio, 65.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b440-8\">Hitchcock, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A80\">There does not appear to be any controversy in this case with respect to the moi\u2019tgago to the State of Ohio. That was prior, in point of time, to the judgments, and to the mortgage to Eastman, and as no objection is x\u2019aised to it, wo suppose it was regularly recorded. The real controversy is between the complainants, as judgment creditors, and Horace H. Eastman, the second mortgagee. All the judgments and mortgages ai\u2019e liens upon the same lands.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-9\">The facts with respect to these two parties are, that the mortgage was executed on the 7th of Apx\u2019il, but was not entered for record until the 12th. A term of the court of common pleas commenced on the 10th of April; and on the 20th, but dux-ing the same term of the court, judgment was obtained by the complainant upon a <em>cognovit. </em>If the judgment operated as a lien from the first day of the term, this lien is preferable to the lien of the mortgage, because elder in point of time than the date of the delivery of the mortgage for record. That it does so operate there can be no doubt, unless we entirely disregard the statute. By a former-statute, judgments of this character did not operate as liens until <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518, 519\">*518, 519</page-number>the date of their actual entry. But, for some reason, the legislature thought proper to change this provision, and by the law, as ' it now stands, all judgments are placed upon the same footing, and the lands of the judgment debtor are bound from the first day of the term in which such judgments are entered. This point being settled, this case is precisely like the case of Mayham <em>v. </em>B. Coombs and ^others, decided at the present term. We believe the decision in that case to be correct, and must adhere to it. As between the judgments and the secon'd mortgage, the former must have the preference, and a decree may be taken accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b441-5\">Wood, C.
