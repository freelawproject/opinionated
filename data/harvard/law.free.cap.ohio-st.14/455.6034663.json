C., deceased, by the name and firm of Weidler, Carpenter, etc., were the contractors, and that the contract *was completed July 1, 1840 ; whereupon the plaintiff produced an instrument in writing, as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b392-9\">\u201c Due G-. Carpenter, on settlement of canal operations on section ten, Hocking canal, $1,748, which we promise to pay him or order \u2022on final estimate of said section.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b392-10\">\u201c Weidler, Carpenter &amp; Co.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b392-11\">\n<em>\u201cPer PL. G. Weidler:</em>\n</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b392-12\"><em>\u201cNovember </em>19, 1838.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b392-13\">The signature of Henry C. Weidler thereto, and the indorsement of G-. C., deceased, to the plaintiff thereon, being admitted by the defendants, the plaintiff offered said instrument in evidence as the note declared on, which was objected to by the defendant G-. O-., and also by the defendant Weidler; which objection was \u25a0overruled by the court, and the paper admitted in evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b392-14\">To reverse this judgment the writ of error was sued out, and the errors assigned are:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b392-15\">1. That the court erred in sustaining the demurrer to the first, third, and fourth pleas of the. defendant, G-. Carpenter.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b392-16\">2. That the court erred in receiving in evidence the note specisfied in the bill of exceptions:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b392-17\">3. That the court erred in rendering judgment for the plaintiff.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b393-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>Henry Stanbery and H. H. Hunter, for plaintiffs in error:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b393-5\">The paper counted upon and offered in evidence was a mere memorandum, not negotiable, and therefore passed no title to the plaintiff below, by indorsement. The'pavment depended upon a future contingency, and though the event is now reduced to a certainty, that circumstance can not affect the character of the instrument. Its character was stamped upon it at the time of its execution ; if void then, no subsequent event can give it vitality. Carlos v. Fancourt, 5 Term, 482; Kingston <em>v. </em>Long, 4 Doug. 9; Chit. on Bills, 134, n. y; 137, n. e; Ib. n. <em>z.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b393-6\">*The English cases referred to by counsel for the defendant are not analogous. For instance, a note payable on the death, of A. B. is good, because in the course of nature, he must die. So, too, it has been held that paying off of <em>government ships </em>is <em>amorally certain </em>event, and a note made payable on such an event would be good; but these decisions have been questioned. See note z, Chitty on Bills, 137, before cited. But what certainty was there that the work on this section would ever be done, on which a final estimate could be made?</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b393-7\">But again, this paper is invalid as a note, because made under such circumstances that the <em>sum </em>to be paid <em>is totally uncertain. </em>Smith <em>v. </em>Lusher, 5 Cow. 706, 708.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b393-8\">John T. Brazee, for defendant in error:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b393-9\">The event, upon the happening of which this was to be paid, was sufficiently certain. The legislature of Ohio (see Local L. for 1836, p. 311) made the Hocking Valley canal a public work, and the payment of estimates for work done on the canal as certain as any of the operations or promises of the government.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b393-10\">An event depending ujoon an act which a state is bound to perform, and which, if she redeems her promises, she will perform, is sufficiently certain to impart negotiability to the instrument of writing made payable on the happening of such an event. Andrews <em>v. </em>Franklin, 1 Strange, 24; Evans v. Underwood, 1 Wilson, 262; 1 Selw. N. P. 282.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b393-11\">A note payable on the death of a certain person, is a good note; the event being certain to happen, though the <em>time </em>is uncertain. Collehan v. Cook, Willes, 393, 398.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b393-12\">The objection has been made, and may be again, that the instrument is invalid, because one of the makers and the payee are the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460, 461\">*460, 461</page-number>same person. The point is not well taken. 1 Caine, 191; Harrison <em>v. </em>Jackson, 7 Term, 99; Smith <em>v. </em>Lusher, 5 Cow. 688.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"ALW\">*Read, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AX1\">The present action is founded upon the following writing:</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">\u201c Due G-. Carpenter, on settlement of canal operations on section No. 10, Hocking Canal, $1,748, which we promise to pay him or order on final estimate of said section.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">(Signed,) \u201c Weidler, Carpenter &amp; Co.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">H. C. Weidler.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-9\"><em>\u201cNovember </em>19,1838.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b394-10\">Kauffman has sued upon this writing in his own name as a negotiable note.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-11\">To constitute a negotiable note, it must be payable at all events. The event must be one which must happen in due course of the laws of nature. The only exception to be found in the books is in England \u2014 where it has been held that a note payable, in the event of the government paying off the public ships, is negotiable. The paying off the government ships is there regarded as an event which must happen. The prosperity, glory, and pride of England consist in her navy; and they arc not willing to tolerate the idea that government will not discharge its duty in this respect. But this exception has justly been doubted as law. But admitting it to be a correct principle \u2014 that an event depending upon the government performing its duty is sufficiently certain \u2014 \u25a0 it will not help this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-12\">The event upon which this note was made payable, was the happening of final estimate on the completion of section No. 10. This is an event which must transpire neither by the laws of nature, nor by the performance of its duty by the government; but upon the contingency of Weidler &amp; Co. completing the job of said section No. 10. This paper, then, is not a negotiable note, but just what it purports to be \u2014 a memorandum of settlement between two members of a firm, finding an amount due one at that time, not binding upon the third, unless he assented, to be paid and adjusted according to the state of the account on final settlement of the partnership concerns, and completion of section No. 10, for which the ^partnership was formed, and on final estimate of what was due from the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-14\">This view disposes of the whole case.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>The court, therefore, erred in sustaining the demurrer to the special pleas. The declaration showing no cause of action, and a \u25a0demurrer looking back to the first error, judgment should have been given for the defendant. Judgment reversed, and judgment for defendants.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
