Miller, the drawer, and demanded the piayment, which was not obtained, and answer made that it would not be paid. I therefore duly notified the drawer and indorser *of the non-payment of the same. Thereupon, I, the said notary, at the request aforesaid, have protested, and do hereby protest, against the said drawer and indorser of the said bill, and all others concerned, for all exchange and re-exchange, costs, damages, and interests, suffered and to be suffered in want of payment thereof; thus done and protested, in the city of Philadelphia, aforesaid, the 9th day of .September, 1840. <em>In testimonia veritatis.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b406-8\">[l. s.] \u201c Edward Hurst, <em>Notary Public.\u201d</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b406-9\">Then follows the copy of the second bill of exchange and protest, similar in terms to the preceding :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b406-10\">\u201cTo the-offering of these bills of exchange in evidence, to support the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action, the defendants, by their counsel, objected, for all the reasons hereinafter set- forth; but the bills were permitted to go in evidence, reserving the questions of law for the charge of the court; and, the plaintiff\u2019s testimony having closed:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b406-11\">\u201c The defendant, by his counsel, moved the court to charge the jury:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b406-12\">\u201c 1.

That, if a penalty be annexed to the transaction, the transaction is just as much null and void as if it were positively prohibited by the statute.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b407-6\">\u201c5.

That if, from the testimony in this case, the jury are of opinion that the Washington Social Library Company, otherwise called the Washington Bank, was an unauthorized banking association, under the act of January 27,1816, and that the draft in controversy was drawn by E. L. Jones, a cashier, in the transaction of this illegal business of banking, then the transaction and making of the draft of said association was illegal, and that an action can not be sustained upon said draft.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b407-8\">\u201c7. That if, from the testimony, the jury are of opinion that \u2018The Washington Bank\u2019 was an unauthorized banking association, under the act of January 27, 1816, and that the draft in controversy was drawn by E. L. Jones, a cashier, in the transaction of this illegal business of banking, and that Joseph Watson was the payee and indorser of this draft, that this indorsement was an illegal act, which subjects him to a penalty and prevents a recovery upon the paper against him; because a person may allege his own criminality, provided it consists in some positive statute of the state.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b407-9\">\u201c8. That, if the jury are of opinion, as to the facts as stated in fourth and fifth requests to charge, then this draft is illegal and void.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b407-10\">\u201c 9. That section 3 of the act of January 27,1816, not only renders illegal all notes issued or made by said bank for circulation, commonly known as bank notes, but every contract made as a bank.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b407-11\">\u201c 10. That section 11 of the act of January 27,1816, insisted upon by plaintiff\u2019s counsel, does not apply to the suit on this draft, but is a remedy confined to an action against a defendant as a stockholder, shareholder, or partner, in said bank.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b407-12\">.\u201c 11. That, if the jury are satisfied from the pi\u2019oofs that the Washington Bank, which appears as the drawer of these bills, was the same institution as the Washington Social Library Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477, 478\">*477, 478</page-number>pany or Corporation of Miamisburg, and that the said institution was, at the date of those bills, exorcising banking powers, and drew these bills by its cashier, as a bank; that then *the defendant and plaintiff, being both indorsers of the bills, were, by such indorsement, liablo to the penalties of the statute in such case provided, and engaged in an illegal act, and the plaintiff can not recover of the defendant upon the said indorsement of the defendants; that the public statute providing such penalties, and the act of incorporation of the Washington Social Library Company, being the public laws of this state, the plaintiff is presumed to have notice of the unauthorized character of such bank and the drafts drawn by it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b408-6\">\u201c 12. That, when a note is protested in Philadelphia, the immediate indorsers of the holder, residing in Cincinnati, and the other prior indorsors in Miamisburg, in this county; and when there is nothing proved from which it appears that the holder was ignorant of the residence of any of the indorsers; and when the due and ordinary course of mail from Philadelphia to Miamisburg, was not through or by the way of Cincinnati; it is not sufficient notice to the defendant at Miamisburg to inclose a notice for the defendant, Watson, by mail, to the immediate indorser, to forward the same notice from the holder, on the same day when received by him from defendant, by mail, from Cincinnati to Miamisburg; that the immediate indorser of the holder, on receiving notice, from the holder, of the dishonor of the bill, might himself give notice to his prior indorser, including Watson, the defendant, in order to charge them, and would be allowed one day for the service or sending of such notice, or such immediate indorser might rely on the notice from the holder at Philadelphia to Watson. But, if the immediate indorsor chose to rely on the notice from the holder at Philadelphia to Watson, that notice would only avail him, if regularly made by the holder, or notary acting for the holder, and addressed and sent directly to Watson, by the due and ordinary course of mail, from Philadelphia to Miamisburg\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b408-7\">\u201cWhich said several matters of charge the court refused; but charged the jury that, notwithstanding the principles claimed, yet the plaintiffs were entitled to recover upon said draft or *bill of exchange, so offered in evidence. To which opinion the defendant excepts, and prays the court to sign and seal this, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>his bill of exceptions, and that it be made part of the record in this cause; and it is done accordingly.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b409-5\">Upon -which bill of exceptions the following errors were assigned :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b409-6\">\u201c1. That the said court overruled the demurrer to the second and fourth counts of the said amended declaration, when the same should have been sustained, and judgment thereon rendered for the said Joseph Watson.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b409-7\">\u201c 2, That\u2019the court permitted the said bill of exchange, offered in evidence by the said Wilson N. Brown &amp; Cp., to go to the jury, when the same should have been excluded, for want of sufficient notice to the said Watson and indorser.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b409-8\">\u201c 3. That the court refused to charge the jury, as requested, upon the several points set forth in the said bill ef exceptions; but charged that the said plaintiff was entitled to recover of the said Watson.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b409-9\">Odlin <em>&amp; </em>Schenck, for plaintiff:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b409-10\">We claim that, inasmuch as the association which issued these bills of exchange, was an illegal association, acting in violation of ' law, the instruments are void. Being a void, illegal transaction, a court will not lend its aid, but leave the parties as they are. 1 Saund. 306 ; Bayley <em>v. </em>Tabor, 5 Mass. 286 ; Wheeler <em>v. </em>Russell, 17 Mass. 258; Farrar <em>v. </em>Barton, 5 Mass. 395 ; Hall <em>v. </em>Mullen, 5 Har. &amp; J. 193; 4 Dall. 298; 6 Binn. 321; 4 Serg. &amp; R. 159; 1 Binn. 118; 4 Dali. 269.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b409-11\">The evidence of protest is not sufficient. Except in some states, under their peculiar statutes, the statement of the notary *in his certificate that he made demand and gave notice, is not sufficient evidence, without stating in what manner the one was made and the other given, that the court may judge of their legality. Smith <em>v. </em>McManers, 7 Serg. 477; 6 Serg. &amp; R. 484; 4 McC. 57.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b409-12\">Stoddard &amp; Haynes, for defendants:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b409-13\">Paper of the description of these bills of exchange, though issued by a company, associated as an unauthorized banking association, is not void. On the contrary, the act of 1816 expressly provides for the collection of such paper, and makes all the stockholders and officers of the association liable to be sued upon it, in their individual capacity.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b409-14\">The demand and notice were sufficient, and the notarial seal sufficient evidence thereof, though this was not all the evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>adduced. On this point, in addition to cases cited by plaintiff\u2019s counsel, see Halliday <em>v. </em>McDougal, 20 Wend. 81; 19 Amer. Jur. 138; Triplett <em>v. </em>Hunt, 3 Dana, 128.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b410-5\">Birchard, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AKq\">The record shows that, after the court of common pleas overruled the demurrer to the second and fourth counts, the defendants plead issuably to the action, and.went to trial. This, according to the course of decision in this court, was a waiver of the demurrer, and disposed of the firpt cause assigned for error. The provisions of the recent statute, do not apply to cases tried in the court of common pleas prior to its taking effect. The act was not intended to, and can not have any retrospective operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">The second assignment can not be maintained. It is no objection to a particular item of evidence, that, unsustained by other proof, it is insufficient to entitle a party to recover. If it has a tendency to support the issue, it is admissible, and should not be ruled out. The question of its sufficiency, taken in connection with all the proof in evidence to the jury, will ^remain open, to be tested on demurrer to the whole evidence on trial, by the court, or by a verdict of jury, under instructions of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">The third assignment presents two inquiries:</p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">1. Did the court err in refusing to instruct the jury as requested ?</p>\n<p id=\"b410-9\">2. In giving the instruction stated in the bill of exceptions?</p>\n<p id=\"b410-10\">We will consider these in their order.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-11-pl-split\">On a careful examination, the record will not be found to disclose any fact showing that the plaintiff could have been benefited by the instructions requested, if the court had complied and given them in charge, in the words proposed by counsel, or that ho has been at all prejudiced by the refusal of which he complains. For aught that appears, the thirteen propositions were entirely out of the case, and may be considered abstract propositions. The bill of exceptions docs not profess to contain all the evidenco that was submitted to the jury. It contains nothing making the instruction requested applicable to the issuo, but what appears on the face of the bills of exchange. They both purport to have boon made by the Washington Bank, at Miamisburg \u2014 an illegal association, doing business as a banking institution \u2014 in violation of the acts of 1815 and 1816. It may be admitted that the paper was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>sufficient to show this; but it by no means follows that tho court erred in refusing to give the instructions. The prohibitions of those statutes are against <em>paper designed and intended </em>to be put in circulation as money. It does not affect suits brought upon the promissory notes, bills of exchange, and other contracts executed and entered into by tho illegal association. Porter <em>v. </em>Pumroy et al., decided this term.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">So far from making void such instruments, section 11 of the act of 1816 (Swan\u2019s Stat. 137) imparts to them a <em>peculiar </em>vitality, by making all persons interested in the illegal association liable, jointly and severally, in their individual capacity, for their payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">*And section 13 entitles the holder to recover without proof of presentment and demand of payment, at tho place where made payable.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">Tho charge of the court, by implication, admits tho correctness of tho principle contained in the thirteen propositions of the plaintiff, as general propositions, and denies their application to this ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">. As before stated, if the court were right in this, it could not help the plaintiff\u2019s case; and if wrong, it could not have prejudiced it.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-9\">It remains to be considered whether the proof given was sufficient to justify the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-10\">The protest and proof of notice are said to have been insufficient. Admitting that the merit of the case depended entirely upon this proof, it may well be doubtocf whether there was sufficient evidence of demand and notice. Tho bill, it is true, is a foreign bill, and the more recent doctrine is, that tho notarial certificate of a foreign notary, when introduced, is evidence of tho facts stated in it. Yet, as will be seen by the cases referred to in argument, the authorities upon the point are conflicting; and I have been unable to find in the decisions of the United States court, whose decision I would regard as conclusive upon tho question, any case in which the certificate of the notary has been held sufficient, when it did not contain a statement of the facts showing tho manner and time of giving tho notice. Without, however, determining the question'whether the proof of demand and notice, according to the usages and customs of merchants, was sufficient, we are of opinion the case may be disposed of, because the evidence just\u2019fied the instructions which were given.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-11\">All banking institutions of this state are creatures of the law. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482, 483\">*482, 483</page-number>By statute, their charters are general laws, of which the courts are bound to take notice. It follows that they were bound to take notice that the Washington Bank was an unauthorized institution, and that a demand at the place where payable, was not necessary to entitle the holder to recover the amount of *these bills of exchange. Watson was the payee and first indorser. He also was bound to know that no demand was .required, and that be needed neither demand nor notice to enable him, if a <em>bona fide </em>holder, to collect them of the association. He had no right to expect the bills would be paid if presented, and therefore no right to claim exemption from liability for want of demand and notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">Upon the examination of the whole record, we think there was no error in the instructions given, and none in the refusal com- . plained of. Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
