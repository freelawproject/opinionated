Restraint of Trade\u2014Contracts\u2014Consideration.\u2014When contracts in restraint of trade are reasonable in their nature and are supported by a valid consideration they will be enforced by the courts, and if there be a reasonable limitation only, the courts will not inquire whether the consideration is adequate in value to that which the party loses by the restraint.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b65-4\" pgmap=\"65\">2. Same\u2014 What are Reasonable Limits.\u2014The court is of the opinion that the territory (the city of Chicago) is not so large nor the term of five years so long as to make a contract in restraint of trade unreasonable or opposed to public policy.</headnotes><summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b65-5\" pgmap=\"65\">Bill for Injunction.\u2014Appeal from the Circuit Court of Cook County; the Hon.

Gavin; that for several years prior to the 20th day of April, 1892, said business was carried on at numbers 976 and 978 West Lake street, and at number 1391 West Madison street, in the city of Chicago, by Patrick Hursen, Sr., the defendant, and for a few months prior to said date by the defendant and Patrick Hursen, Jr., under the firm name of P. Hursen &amp; Son; that each owned a one-half interest in the business during said few months they were so in partnership; that on or about April 20, 1892, Patrick Hursen, Sr., offered to sell his interest in the livery and undertaking business, etc., for $6,000, and did sell it to the complainant for $5,500, agreeing with the complainant not to engage in the livery and undertaking business in the city of Chicago for a period of five years from the 20th day of April, 1892; that P. Hursen, the defendant, has opened up an undertaking establishment at 1057 West Lake street.</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b66-4\" pgmap=\"66\">Exceptions were filed to the master\u2019s report; they being in substance that the agreement of appellant with appellee was solely with regard to the barns at 976 and 978 West Lake street, Chicago, and at 1391 West Madison street, and that the \u201c evidence shows that said Gavin is not and for some months has not been engaged in business in either of said places, and his interest in this cause has ceased, and for that reason no injunction should be granted in said cause.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b66-5\" pgmap=\"66\">A decree in accordance with the prayer of the bill having been rendered, this appeal is prosecuted.</p><attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b66-6\" pgmap=\"66\">Runyan &amp; Runyan, attorneys for appellant.</attorneys><attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b66-7\" pgmap=\"66\">E.

Presiding Justice Waterman</author> <p id=\"A5U\" pgmap=\"66\">delivered the opinion op the Court.</p> <p id=\"b66-9\" pgmap=\"66\">It is immaterial whether appellee is now doing business at the place purchased from appellant or elsewhere; the contract was in effect to obtain the good will of the business and the agreement covered the city of Chicago for the term of five years.</p> <p id=\"b66-10\" pgmap=\"66\">We do not think that the territory covered by the contract\u2014the city of Chicago\u2014is so large, or the term thereof \u2014five years\u2014so long, as to make it unreasonable or opposed to public policy. As to this see Green v. Price, 13 M. &amp; W. 695; Same v. Same, 16 M. &amp; W. 346; Davis v. Mason, 5 Term, 118; Bunn v. Gay, 4 East 190; Malian v. May, 11 M. &amp;W. 665.</p> <p id=\"b66-13\" pgmap=\"66\">The contract was not to engage in the livery and undertaking business.</p> <p id=\"b66-14\" pgmap=\"66\">The business of undertaking, necessarily, is drawn from a wide range of territory.</p> <p id=\"b66-15\" pgmap=\"66(10) 67(13)\">Appellee, in violation of his agreement, was about to open an undertaking business in the immediate vicinity of the place he had sold.</p> <p id=\"b67-4\" pgmap=\"67\">The question as to whether a restriction of the kind now under discussion is reasonable is one of mingled law and fact.</p> <p id=\"b67-5\" pgmap=\"67\">The report of the master recommending the granting of an injunction is in effect a finding that the restrictive terms of the contract are, under the circumstances, reasonable.</p> <p id=\"b67-6\" pgmap=\"67\">The exceptions to the report are not applicable to this finding.</p> <p id=\"b67-7\" pgmap=\"67\">When contracts of this kind are reasonable in their nature and are supported by a valid consideration, they will be enforced by the courts, and if there be a reasonable limitation only, the courts will not inquire whether the consideration is adequate or equal in value to that which the party loses by the restraint.
