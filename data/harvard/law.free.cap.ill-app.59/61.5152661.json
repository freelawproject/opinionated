In fact it is his duty to attack even the original attachment proceedings if within his power to do so. It will not do to say that because the reviewing court may be of opinion that upon a hearing such motion or exceptions Avould have been overruled, therefore there was no error in ignoring them. It Avas the duty of the trial court before entering judgment by default to dispose of said motion of July 11th in some way. It Avas error to enter final judgment by default while said motion AAras undisposed of.

Lewis, 9 Mon. 399. A motion is properly- an application for a rule or order, made viva voce to a court or judge. It is distinguished from the more formal applications for relief by petition or complaint. The People v.

It is distinguished from the more formal applications for relief by petition or complaint. The grounds of the motion are often required to be stated in writing and filed. In practice the form of application itself is often reduced to writing and filed. But making out and filing the application itself is not to make the motion. If nothing were done it would not be error in the court to entirely ignore the proceeding. The attention of the court must be called to it. The court must be moved to grant the order. 3 Stephens\u2019 Com. 679; Burrill\u2019s Law Dict., word \u2018 motion; \u2019 \u201d People v.

Howell, 6 Yerg. 311, the court says :</p><p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b61-7\" pgmap=\"61\">6i But in a case by motion like this there is nothing upon which the court can act, until the motion is made in court, and entered of record. Then, and not till then, the court has a cause before it, after which it is continued in court until it may be finally heard. Before this motion is thus made and entered of record the defendant can take no step whatever in this matter. There is nothing to dismiss, for there is no process returned into court by which the court can recognize the case.\u201d See also Miller v. Boyd, 1 Dana 272.</p><p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b61-8\" pgmap=\"61\">In Prall v. Hunt et al., 41 Ill. App. 140, this honorable'court said:</p><p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b61-9\" pgmap=\"61\">\u201c But silent\u2019y filing a paper does not fill the common law definition of a motion which is an application to a court or judge.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b61-10\" pgmap=\"61\">These authorities, he contended, establish beyond a doubt that the act of July 13 th, in filing a paper, supposed to be a motion, with the clerk of the court, preserved no rights for it.</p> <opinion data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b62-3\" pgmap=\"62\">Mb.

McClelland, in a suit by attachment in the Circuit Court, recovered a judgment against the appellee for \u00a73,426.06. The appellant had been summoned as a garnishee, had not answered, and on that day a conditional judgment, in favor of the appellee for the use of McClelland, was entered for \u201c the sum of three thousand four hundred and twenty-three dollars and six cents, being the amount of the original judgment rendered herein, together with all plaintiff\u2019s costs and charges in this behalf expended, unless the said garnishee, after being duly served with scirefacias to be issued, shall show cause, if any it has, why the above conditional judgment should not be made final and execution issued, accordingly.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b62-6\" pgmap=\"62\">A scire facias was served on the appellant October 22, 1891, and nothing more was done in the case until July 11, 1893, when the appellant filed with the clerk of the court a paper purporting to be a motion to set aside the conditional judgment for several reasons which need not be repeated. Then nothing more was done until November 19, 1894, when the appellee took judgment as follows:</p> <p id=\"b62-9\" pgmap=\"62(151) 63(35)\">\u201c This day again comes the plaintiff to this suit, by his attorney, and it appearing to the court that due personal service of scirefacias issued in said cause has been had on Washington Park Club, garnishee herein, for at least ten days before the first day of this term, and it being called comes not, nor does any person for it, but herein it makes default, which is on motion of plaintiff\u2019s attorney ordered to be taken, and the same is hereby entered herein of record; wherefore the conditional judgment rendered herein against said garnishee ought to be made final. Therefore it is considered by the court that the defendant, for the use of the plaintiff, do have and recover of and from the said Washington Park Club, the sum of three thousand and four hundred and twenty-three dollars and six cents interest thereon from October 17, 1891, being the amount of the original judgment rendered herein against the defendant at the date aforesaid, together with all plaintiff\u2019s costs and charges in this as well as in that behalf expended, and have execution therefor.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b63-5\" pgmap=\"63\">It is now insisted:</p> <p id=\"b63-6\" pgmap=\"63\">1. That the appellant was entitled to notice before entering the final judgment.</p> <p id=\"b63-7\" pgmap=\"63\">2. That final judgment should not have been entered without first disposing of the motion of July 11,1893.</p> <p id=\"b63-8\" pgmap=\"63\">3. That the judgment is excessive by including the uncertain amount of costs and charges.</p> <p id=\"b63-9\" pgmap=\"63\">The first of those points is based upon a rule of the Circuit Court shown in the bill of exceptions, as follows:</p> <p id=\"b63-10\" pgmap=\"63\">\u201c No motion will be heard or order made in any cause without notice to the opposite party when an appearance of said party has been entered, except where a party is in default or where the cause is reached on the calendar.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b63-11\" pgmap=\"63\">Although the appellant had been summoned on the scire facias to the November term, 1891, and had not answered, yet it could not be said to be in default, if it had made a motion which, if sustained, would dispense with an answer.</p> <p id=\"b63-12\" pgmap=\"63\">Can a paper, purporting to be a motion in a cause, filed with the clerk of the court without notice to anybody interested, and which, so far as this record shows, may never have come to the knowledge of the court or opposing counsel, be a motion that stops proceedings, and which may thereafter be exhumed and held to be sufficient cause for undoing all that, except for that paper, was regularly done ?</p> <p id=\"b63-13\" pgmap=\"63\">That such a paper is not a motion is old law. Prall v. Hunt, 41 Ill. App. 140; 3 Bl. Com. 304.</p> <p id=\"b63-15\" pgmap=\"63\">Barristers were called in the order of their seniority and each made his own motion, if he wished to do so, and but one in one day. 1 Burr. 57.</p> <p id=\"b63-16\" pgmap=\"63(58) 64(50)\">There is no allusion in books of practice to such a course as was here pursued. See 3 Chit. Gen. Pr. 573. For the purpose of making a calendar of a class of motions called \u201cenumerated\u201d the old Supreme Court of New York had a rule for filing \u201c a note of issue.\u201d Graham, Pr., 671. \u201c A motion is properly an application for a rule or order made viva voce to a court or judge.\u201d Making out and filing an application \u201c is not to make a motion.\u201d ' \u201c The attention of the court must be called to it.\u201d People v. Ah Sam, 41 Cal. 645.</p> <p id=\"b64-6\" pgmap=\"64\">In Hall v. Hess, 27 Ill. 411, Caton, J., disparaged even a motion for new trial where the course pursued resembled that in this case.</p> <p id=\"b64-7\" pgmap=\"64\">The case last cited disposes of the second point upon one ground, and Home Flax Co. v. Beebe, 48 Ill. 138, and Deere v. Lewis, 51 Ill. 254, do the same thing upon another, i. e., that the judgment entered overruled the motion.</p> <p id=\"b64-8\" pgmap=\"64\">The third point is based upon a wrong reading of a clumsily written record. The words \u201cinterest thereon from October 17, 1891,\u201d'must be rejected as surplusage. They have in the connection in which they are used, no definite meaning, and besides it is not to be left to the sheriff holding an execution to determine the amount of the judgment.</p> <p id=\"b64-9\" pgmap=\"64\">The statute authorizes him to collect interest from the date of the judgment, and usage in this State has justified a judgment for costs without stating the amount; but in general, a money judgment must be for a sum fixed. Black on Judgments, Sec. 118.</p> <p id=\"AUr\" pgmap=\"64\">The judgment in this case is only for a fixed sum.</p> <p id=\"b64-11\" pgmap=\"64\">The recital \u201c being the amount,\u201d etc., while not true in fact, means that the sum named is the amount of the original judgment and costs.</p> <p id=\"b64-12\" pgmap=\"64\">There is no error and the judgment is affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
