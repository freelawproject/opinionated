The company appeared, and consenting to the appointment of a receiver, the following order was made on the first day of September, 1894:</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b57-5\" pgmap=\"57\">\u201c The Knapp Electrical Works, by its president, appearing, and on the said bill of complaint, and on evidence heard in open court, the court finds that Samuel Harris is a creditor of the Knapp Electrical Works, an Illinois corporation; that it is wholly insolvent and unable to continue the business for which it was organized, and has ceased doing such business, leaving debts unpaid; that it is proper that a receiver be appointed, and the court appoints Harry P. Lucas receiver.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b57-6\" pgmap=\"57\">September 7, 1894, appellant obtained leave to, and did file an intervening petition in said cause, setting forth that it had sued out a writ of attachment against said corporation, placed the same in the hands of the sheriff and asked that he levy thereunder on the goods of said company, but that he declined to do so because the property, when said writ was issued, was in the hands of a receiver.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b57-7\" pgmap=\"57(99) 58(17)\">The petition also sets forth that the order of court ap.pointing said receiver was without authority of law; the allegations of said bill (it was alleged) not being sufficient to give the court jurisdiction to make such order; the petition prayed that the sheriff be given leave to levy petitioner\u2019s said attachment writ on the goods of said company. The petition was afterward amended, and on the 26th day of October an order was entered denying petitioner\u2019s motion praying an appeal from the order appointing a receiver of said corporation; also vacating the order granting appellant leave to file said intervening petition, sustaining a demurrer to said petition and dismissing the same.</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b58-5\" pgmap=\"58\">From this order appellants appeal.</p><attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b58-6\" pgmap=\"58\">Chatty Bros., MacLaren, Jarvis &amp; Cleveland, attorneys for appellant.</attorneys><attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b58-7\" pgmap=\"58\">Herrick, Allen &amp; Boyesen, attorneys for appellee F. M. Knapp.</attorneys> <opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b58-8\" pgmap=\"58\">Mr. Presiding Justice Waterman</author> <p id=\"APxY\" pgmap=\"58\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p> <p id=\"b58-9\" pgmap=\"58\">The triplicate disposal of the intervening petition is not approved of. The three inconsistent orders amount to one thing\u2014a dismissal of the petition. The court should not have allowed it to be filed, or should have, when filed, dismissed the same. If the position assumed in said petition is well taken, viz., that the court had no jurisdiction to ap-' point a receiver, appellant can disregard its action and levy on the goods of the corporation in the receiver\u2019s hands; if the sheriff improperly refuse to levy, surely the able counsel who represent appellant know what to do in such case. A good cause of action against the sheriff may be much better than an attachment of the property of an insolvent corporation.</p> <p id=\"b58-10\" pgmap=\"58\">Appellant is endeavoring to collaterally attack the judgment of the Circuit Court. ' If it wish to do this the courts are open for an independent suit.</p> <p id=\"b58-11\" pgmap=\"58\">We are not on this appeal called upon to say whether the court had jurisdiction to appoint a receiver.</p> <p id=\"b58-12\" pgmap=\"58\">The record sets forth facts showing that the court had' jurisdiction of the parties; that it found the existence of facts which gave it jurisdiction of the subject-matter. Counsel well know how the judgment of a court of a superior and general jurisdiction can be attacked and what must be shown in order to set it aside.</p> <p id=\"b58-13\" pgmap=\"58\">Appellant was not entitled to appeal from the order appointing a receiver; it was not a party to such judgment.</p> <p id=\"b58-14\" pgmap=\"58\">The judgment of the Circuit Court is affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
