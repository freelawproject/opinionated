The court holds that service of the. garnishee summons, a certified copy of which is in evidence in this cause, upon the defendant bank on the 31st day of March, 1894, constituted a lien upon the funds of Theodore Nelson in the hands of said bank, to the extent of $200, as of said date of the 31st day of March, 1894, subject only to the final judgment of said justice of the peace in said cause.

Held.</p><p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b330-5\" pgmap=\"330\">4. That the judgment of the said justice in said cause of Theodore Nelson for the use of Samuel Page, a certified transcript of which proceeding is in evidence in this cause, is a valid judgment against said defendant bank, and upon said judgment it was the duty of said defendant bank to pay the sum of $200.

It is further held, as a matter of law, that upon the judgment in evidence in this cause, rendered by Max Eberhardt, Esq., a justice of the peace of Cook County, Illinois, against the defendant bank, the said defendant bank was authorized to make payment of the sum of $200, and it being admitted by the stipulation herein that the said bank did actually pay to said justice of the peace upon said judgment, the sum of $200 on the 2d day of May, 1894, said bank had the right and was lawfully entitled to charge the same against the account of said Theodore Nelson, as of the date of the service of said garnishee summons, to wit, March 31, 1894.

App. 213, opinion by the late Judge McAllister, held that the County Court had not jurisdiction in garnishee proceedings wherein the indebtedness of the garnishee was more than $1,000, the jurisdiction of the County Court being limited to $1,000.</p> <p id=\"b331-4\" pgmap=\"331\">In strict analogy to such ruling, this court thereafter in several cases held that justices of the peace had not, in like proceedings, jurisdiction where the garnishee debtor was owing more than $200.</p> <p id=\"b331-5\" pgmap=\"331\">In a case arising before a justice of the peace the Supreme Court have recently, reversing this court, held that the jurisdiction of a justice of the peace is not, in garnishee proceedings, affected by the amount the garnishee defendant may owe.
