Burnstein, and alleged to have been indorsed and delivered to appellee. The declaration filed October 5, 1894, contains only one count, which alleges that on August 1, 1894, appellant made his note of that date, to the order of A. Barnstein, due sixty days after date, and delivered the same to said Barnstein, for the sum of $943.35, and that said Barnstein indorsed the said note to appellee, and delivered the same to appellee.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b78-10\" pgmap=\"78\">A copy of such note and indorsement was attached to and filed with the declaration, such copy purporting to be of a note payable to the order of \u201c A. Barnstein,\u201d indorsed by \u201c A. Barnstein,\u201d to appellee.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b78-11\" pgmap=\"78\">Appellant filed the general issue, together with notice of special defenses, the substance of such special defenses being that the note was made by appellant to the order of \u201c A. Barnstein,\u201d and delivered to said \u201cBurnstein,\u201d without any consideration, but solely for the purpose of discounting the same and returning the proceeds thereof to appellant; and that such note was taken by one Frankel, from said Burnstein, with knowledge on the part of said Frankel of these facts, and that the plaintiff obtained such note with like knowledge.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b79-4\" pgmap=\"79\">The case was submitted for trial without a jury, and the court found the issues for the plaintiff, and entered judgment on such finding, and the defendant appealed.</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b79-5\" pgmap=\"79\">Appellee offered the note, and indorsements thereon, in evidence, being a note payable to the order of \u201c A. Burn-stein,\u201d indorsed on the back, \u201c Pay to the order of If. B. Hutchinson,\u201d over the signature of \u201c A. Burnstein;\u201d also indorsed on the back, \u201c Warren Springer, I. M. Cushman, A. B. Camp.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b79-6\" pgmap=\"79\">Appellant objected to such note and indorsements being received in evidence because of variance from the allegations of the declaration and from the copy of note and indorsements attached to and filed with the declaration, stating specifically such difference and variation.</p><p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b79-7\" pgmap=\"79\">The court sustained such objections and refused to receive the note and indorsements in evidence.</p><p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b79-8\" pgmap=\"79\">Thereupon appellee\u2019s counsel moved the court for leave to amend the copy of note and copy of indorsement thereon, attached to and filed with the declaration, by changing the name of the payee to \u201c A. Burnstein,\u201d instead of \u201c A. Barn-stein,\u201d and by making the same change in the name of the indorser. Ho amendment was made to the declaration. Appellant\u2019s counsel objected to granting leave to so amend copy of note and indorsement filed, and particularly moved and insisted that if such amendment be allowed, it should be upon terms of continuance, but the court allowed such amendment without imposing such terms, and appellant excepted thereto.</p><p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b79-9\" pgmap=\"79\">Thereupon appellee\u2019s counsel amended the copy of note and indorsement attached to the declaration by changing the name in both from \u201c A. Barnstein \u201d to \u201c A. Burnstein.\u201d Upon such amendment being made, appellant\u2019s counsel again moved the court for a continuance by reason of such amendment, and by reason of the plaintiff\u2019s failure to file with the declaration a true copy of the note and indorsement sued on pursuant to statute.</p><p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b79-10\" pgmap=\"79(20) 80(70)\">The court stated that it would not allow the motion for continuance unless appellant would show that he was prejudiced by the amendment and taken by surprise. Appellant\u2019s counsel replied that he moved for a continuance as .a matter of right, and not as a matter of discretion on the part of the court, his motion being grounded upon the statute, which required the plaintiff to file with his declaration a copy of the instrument sued on. The motion for continuance was overruled and exception preserved.</p><p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b80-5\" pgmap=\"80\">Thereupon appellee\u2019s counsel again offered the note and indorsements thereon in evidence, and appellant renewed his objections thereto specifically, which were overruled, and the same Avere received in evidence, to all of Avhieh appellant duly excepted.</p><p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b80-6\" pgmap=\"80\">Thereupon the appellee rested his case and appellant moved the court to exclude the evidence offered, which motion was overruled.</p><p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b80-7\" pgmap=\"80\">The errors assigned and relied on in this court are: That the trial court erred in receiving the note and indorsements in evidence against the objections of appellant; also in permitting appellee to amend copy of note sued on, Avithout imposing terms of continuance; also in denying the motion of appellant for continuance; also in refusing the propositions of law offered by appellant, severally, and in the finding and judgment.</p><attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b80-8\" pgmap=\"80\">Wm. J. Ammen, attorney for appellant,</attorneys><p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A1Lv\" pgmap=\"80\">contended that \u201c Barnstein \u201d and \u201c Burnstein \u201d are not idem sonans.

The variance should be a substantial and material one, such as would render the instrument offered in evidence a different and distinct instrument from the one described in the declaration to authorize the court to exclude it on the ground of variance. The rule of idem sonans has been much relaxed in modern practice. Stevens v. Stevens, 3 Scam. 25; Wheeler v. Reed, 36 Ill. 85; Frazer et al. v. Smith, 60 Ill. 147; Betton, Admx., v.
