Court of -Clark county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b54-7\">The original action was brought by G. <em>W. </em>Miller against Don Basey and Elizabeth his wife, and others, to foreclose\u00e1 mortgage executed by Basey and wife to secure the payment of a note, in which the plaintiff also prayed for a personal judgment against Basey, for the amount due on the note.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b54-8\">George Spence, plaintiff in error, being a party defendant, answered, setting up a mortgage of indemnity executed to him by Basey alone, and prayed that the amount-of his'lien under the mortgage might be ascertained and its priority declared, etc. ' . \u25a0</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b54-9\">The court found the mortgage of the plaintiff\"to be the-first lien of the premises, and ordered a sale thereof.'

That the judgment, order, or decree appealed from is a final one.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b55-11\">The order in this ease, not relating to any of the issues-made in the case, it can not in any legal sense be final.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b55-12\">No appeal was taken from the judgment or final order,. Tbut simply from a detached portion thereof, singled out by the appellant. 2d. The appeal must be taken in a civil action.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b55-13\">\u00a5e admit that the original action was a civil one, but deny that the order or judgment attempted to be appealed, from was a civil action. 3d.

(S. &amp; S. 589.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b55-15\">But if the appeal was from a final order, judgment, or decree in a civil action, still there is no appeal, because the-matter was one which was triable by a jury. <em>Ladd </em>v. <em>James, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>10 Ohio St. 438; <em>Rowland </em>v. <em>Entrekin, </em>27 Ohio St. 47; <em>Killer </em>v. <em>Wenzell, </em>23 Ohio St. 579.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b56-5\">By the Court.</author>\n<p id=\"AS1\">The appeal was improperly dismissed by \u2022the district court. The order appealed from was a final order in a civil action, in which the parties affected thereby had not the right to demand a trial by jury. Section 5 of the act to relieve district courts, etc., as amended May 16, 1868 (S. &amp; S. 589).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">The case made by Spence in his answer and cross-petition was one for equitable relief only, and as between him .and the wife of the mortgagor, as the claimant of a homestead, there could have been no issue joined for the trial of which either party could have demanded a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">Motion granted, judgment reversed, and cause remanded to district court for further proceedings.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
