The jury returned the following verdict: \u201cWe, the jury in this case, do find said defendant, Bonham Eox, not guilty of the rape, as charged in the indictment; but we do find him guilty of an attempt to commit a rape on the said Anna Catharine Corsmier.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b389-11\">Thereupon the defendant moved to be discharged, which motion the court overruled, and sentenced the defendant to imprisonment in the penitentiary for the term of three and a half years.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b389-12\">It is now assigned for error, that the judgment below is not sustained by the verdict.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b390-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number><em>William W.

Under this section, the jury may find the defendant guilty of an \u201c attempt,\u201d only in a case where the statute-has declared an \u201c attempt,\u201d <em>eo nomine, </em>to be an offense, as in the case of attempt to commit arson (74 Ohio L. 247),. and numerous other cases provided for by the code.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b390-9\"><em>Isaiah Pillars, </em>attorney-general, for the state,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ao-\">claim\u00e9d that the verdict was equivalent to finding the defendant guilty of \u201c an assault with the intent to commit a rape.\u201d <em>Williams </em>v. <em>The State, </em>14 Ohio, 222.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b390-10\">In the case at bar, <em>attempt </em>has precisely the same legal significance as <em>assault, </em>and the jury, under the instruction of the court, could not have been mistaken in the meaning-of the word \u201c attempt,\u201d and what was necessary to constitute an attempt.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b390-11\">An attempt may be defined to be an intent to commit a-particular crime, and the doing of some act looking toward the immediate completion or accomplishment of the-intent. 1 Bishop\u2019s Or.

L. \u00a7 1241 (7th ed.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b390-13\">McIlvaine, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A67\">Section 5, chapter 7, title 2 of the penal code (74 Ohio L. 352) provides: \u201cUpon any indictment,. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>the jury may find the defendant not guilty of the offense-charged, but guilty of an <em>attempt </em>to commit the same,, when <em>such </em>an attempt is an offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">The crime of rape is thus defined (section 9, chapter 3, title 1, 74 Ohio L. 245): \u201c Whoever has carnal knowledge-of a female persou, forcibly and against her will, . . . is guilty of rape.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">Section 14 provides: \u201cWhoever assaults another, with intent ... to commit rape . ... upon the person so assaulted, shall be imprisoned in the penitentiary,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"AHL\">This section 14 is the only provision of our law which makes an attempt to commit rape an offense. Unquestionably, an assault with intent to commit rape is an attempt to commit the offense; but it does not follow that every attempt to commit the offense 'is an assault with intent,, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-10\">It is quite clear that in an \u201c attempt\u201d to commit an offense an \u201c intent \u201d to commit it must <em>b\u00a7 </em>present; and it is. equally clear that the preseuce of intent alone is not sufficient. There must be some concomitant act or movement, toward the execution of the purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-11\">Under our statute, an attempt to commit rape is not an offense, unless the intent to commit it is accompanied witli some act or movement toward its accomplishment which constitutes an \u201c assault.\u201d The question, therefore, is: Are-the words \u201c attempt to commit rape,\u201d in their ordinary meaning, the exact equivalent of the words \u201cassault with intent to commit rape?\u201d We think not, but that the former phrase may describe a state of facts which does not constitute an assault with intent to ravish.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-12\">If it were otherwise, the exact definition of \u201cassault\u201d' would be \u201c an attempt to commit a battery,\u201d and an indictment charging the defendant with an attempt to ravish would be good under a statute making an assault with intent to rape a crime. No one, we conceive, would contend for either of these propositions; not because an assault does not amount to an attempt to commit a battery, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>\u2018because au attempt to commit a battery may not amount to an assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">The distinction maybe thus defined: An assault is an . act done toward the commission of a battery; it must precede the battery, but it does so immediately. The next movement would, at least to all appearance, complete the battery. While an act constituting an attempt to commit a felony may be more remote, as is said in <em>Uhl </em>v. <em>Common</em>wealth, 6 Grat. 706. \u201c The overt act done in the attempt to \u25a0 commit an offense need not be the last proximate act prior to the consummation of the felony intended to be perpetrated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">I do not intimate that any act done in furtherance of a purpose to commit an offense, however remote, would be regarded as an attempt to commit the offense; yet I need not discuss the necessary relation between the act done and the crime intended, either as regards time, space, or adaptation, which must ^dst before the law would pronounce it \u2022an \u201c attempt.\u201d This would be not only difficult, but unimportant labor in this ease, where none of the facts appear. It is enough now to say, that the judgment below must be reversed, unless we can affirm that no act done or movement made toward the perpetration of a rape will .amount to an attempt to commit the crime, in the ordinary meaning of those words, unless the same act or movement would constitute an actual and technical \u201c assault with intent \u201d to commit the offense. This we can not affirm, as we have no doubt that, under many conceivable circum.stances, all the essential elements of an attempt may be present, and yet no assault, within the meaning of the statute, committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<author id=\"b392-8\">By the Court.</author>\n<p id=\"Av5\">Thereupon, this case came on for further consideration as to the order here to be made. Section 11, chapter 8, title 2, penal code (74 Ohio L. 360), provides that \u201c upon the hearing of petition in error, the court may affirm the judgment or reverse it, in whole or in part, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>and order the accused to be discharged or grant a new' trial.\u201d In our opinion, the verdict having failed to respond to the whole indictment in such manner as to authorize the court below either to sentence the accused or' to order his discharge, it was the duty of the court, on its \u2022 own motion, to set the verdict aside, and to order a new trial. <em>The State </em>v. <em>Arthur, </em>21 Iowa, 322 ; <em>The State </em>v. <em>Duncan, </em>2 McCord, 129 ; 1 Bishop Cr. Pro., \u00a7 1016.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">It is therefore now ordered that the verdict be set aside,, and that a new trial on the indictment be granted. <em>Beheimer </em>v. <em>The State, </em>20 Ohio St. 572.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">\n<em>Ordered accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b393-7\">Boynton, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Aq6\">dissenting. I think the accused was well convicted, by the verdict returned, of an assault with intent to \u2022 commit a rape, and, therefore, do not concur in the reversal of the judgment. I especially dissent from the order remanding the cause for a new trial on the charge of rape, as upon that charge the accused was in terms acquitted. The pi\u2019inciple of <em>Beheimer\u2019s case, </em>20 Ohio St. 572, does not apply. There the accused moved to vacate the verdict, and for a new trial, and his motion was granted. Here the accused, without his consent, and against his protest, and without any waiver of the rights secured to him by the constitution, is required to submit to another jury the question of his guilt or innocence upon a charge, of which he has been,. by a legally constituted jury, pronounced not guilty.. This seems to me a plain infraction of the constitution.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
