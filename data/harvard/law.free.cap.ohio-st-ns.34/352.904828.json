See <em>Needles </em>v. <em>Needles, </em>7 Ohio St. 432; 19 Ohio, 328.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b370-5\"><em>(b) </em>Where there is no such intention shown by the will,, and the mere fact that a will is made, is not expressive of such intent, the rule has no application.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b370-6\">Again, in this will, there are no \u201c equivocal wordsand in <em>Gilpin </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>17 Ohio St., 396, where this rule was-invoked, Judge Welch says, \u201cBut when there are no equivocal words, this rale can have no application.\u201d Again, there is nothing in this will to show that the attention of the testator was called to the <em>United States bonds.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b370-7\"><em>(c) </em>But the conclusive answer to this is : that courts will not give such a construction to equivocal words as to <em>clisinherit an heir.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b370-8\">Laura A. Kimball was the only child of his son Asa, and the <em>heir </em>to his share.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b370-9\"><em>(d) </em>The devise of personality on the farm and choses inaction, such as notes $4,563, and cash $299, is made in connection with the disposal of the real estate to the widow,, during her natural life, or widowhood, and is in these words: \u201c And all my personal property, household goods, and provisions, including moneys and credits, of every description, <em>which may be thereon </em>at the time of my decease, during her natural life.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b370-10\">This gift of the personalty <em>on the farm, </em>unlike the devise-of the real estate, is not defeated by her marriage, the terms \u201c as long as she may remain my widow,\u201d <em>being omitted here.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b370-11\">In this part of the will nothing is said about the estate in remainder in the real estate, nor in the personalty, but-after disposing of the estate in remainder in the real estate, the will goes on to say: \u201c I also at the death of my said wife, if there should be any of said personal property,, hereby devised to my said wife, Julia, left unconsumed,. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>then it is my will that <em>it </em>shall be equally divided amongst,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b371-5\">This is a clear and unmistakable description of the personalty described in the first clause quoted and described as \u201c said personal property \u201d which <em>was on the real estate, </em>and can not be so enlarged as to embrace <em>money </em>and <em>bonds, </em>not devised for life, nor described, under the name of \u201c all my personal property,\u201d etc., \u201c which may be thereon,\u201d that is, on the devised real estate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b371-6\">After thus making a complete disposition of this class of personalty, the testator then speaks of money on deposit.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b371-7\">By an independent clause he says: \u201c It is my will that all money on <em>deposit </em>or otherwise, <em>is to be left on deposit at interest, </em>during the natural life time of my said wife, except the interest to be drawn and used by her as she may need.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b371-8\">Here is a clear line of demarkation drawn. All the personalty, including moneys and credits, that may be <em>on the real estate, </em>is devised to the widow, during life; <em>charged, with the payment of debts </em>and <em>with her right to consume the whole, </em>if needed, and only that part <em>left unconsumed </em>at her death goes to the legatees; but the money on deposit is so fixed that it is not charged with the debts, neither has she the general power to consume it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b371-9\">To construe the general devise of personalty in the first clause, so as to embrace this money or bonds in banks, would give the widow the right to consume it, and thus defeat the positive language that this money on deposit was <em>to be left at interest, </em>the widow only having the right to draw the interest if needed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b371-10\">As to the former, the right to consume the whole is only vested in the widow; as to the latter, the right to draw the <em>interest </em>if needed, only is given.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b371-11\">Any construction which blends two classes defeats the intention of the will.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b371-12\"><em>(e) </em>A devise of \u201c all the remainder of my moneys \u201d will not embrace money in the funds. <em>Willis </em>v. <em>Plasset, </em>4 Beaver, 208.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b372-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>The word \u201c money \u201d in a will means that and nothing else. 9 Beav. 324.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b372-5\">It means gold and silver and the lawful circulating medium of the country.

Where' a will is executed, making a disposition of property of the testator, both real and personal, a presumption arises that he intended thereby to dispose of his whole estate, unless the contrary appears. And, although the will in the present instance was evidently drawn with little attention to accuracy of language, enough appears to satisfy us that no part of the propei\u2019ty of the testator was left undisposed of. The clause giving to the wife \u25a0\u201c all my personal property, household goods, and provisions, including moneys and credits of every description which may be thereon at the time of my decease, during her natural life,\u201d standing alone, and its meaning ascertained without regard to other provisions of the will, would seem to lead to the conclusion contended for by counsel for the defendant ; although, in such case, giving to the word \u201ccredits\u201d a locality or abiding place, would involve a somewhat singular use of language. But nothing is more clearly settled, or of more frequent application in the construction of a will, than the rule Requiring the intention of the testator to be gathered from all its parts, and not from isolated passages; and when this clause is considered in conjunction with the remaining provisions, such intention is readily ascertained. The words \u201c which may be thereon \u201d evidently relate to the personal estate previously mentioned, other than money or credits, which might, at the testator\u2019s death, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>be on tbe premises; for, in tbe very next line, he directs the sale of <em>so much thereof, </em>referring to the property \u201c which may be thereon,\u201d as may be sufficient to pay his just debts, \u2014a direction that will hardly be claimed to refer to moneys or credits.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">But we find, further on, that he gave, to be paid out of the personal estate, at the death of the widow, legacies amounting to $3,005. It is by no means clear, that what remains after payment of the debts of the estate by the executrix, and the consumption by her of what she is entitled to consume or expend during life, will be sufficient to pay off and discharge the legacies thus created, unless the money on deposit, or the United States bonds, are available for the purpose; and if the legacies are not paid, that \u25a0equality of participation in the testator\u2019s estate, which the payment of the legacy to Mrs. Noble, and the one to Mrs. \u25a0Suiter, was designed to effect among the three daughters, will be entirely defeated.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">Again, what the testator says of the provision made for his granddaughter, Laura A. Kimball, and the one for her mother, Mrs. Stewart, in conjunction with what is said re\u2022specting the gift to the son before his decease, would seem to show quite clearly, that he did not intend Laura to have \u2022any other or further portion of his estate, than that provided by the will. He says, \u201c It is also considered by me, that the $500 devised to Laura A. Kimball, and $5 to Alice L. Stewart, and the tract of land conveyed to my son, Asa Kimball, deceased, and his heirs, make for them <em>an equitable share of my </em>estate.\u201d It is a mistake to suppose that this language is the same in import as that used in respect to the legacies of Mrs. Noble and Mrs. Suiter. The testator declared that he considered their legacies to make for them an equitable share of his estate <em>with Amy Gillen and her heirs. </em>Here, manifestly, is an implied reference to a previous advancement to Mrs. Gillen, which, in the distribution of his \u2022estate, she is required, to account for. This advancement .and the devise to her by the will, with the legacy and de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>vise to each of her sisters, placed the three upon a footing of equality; and this is what the expression of the testator, in effect, declared, and in our judgment, is all that it meant. But when he declared that the legacy to the granddaughter, and the one to her mother, in connection with the tract of land conveyed to the son before his decease, made for them an equitable share of his estate, he evidently intended to convey the meaning that this language implies, for he divides what remains unconsumed at the widow\u2019s death, of the \u201cpersonal property or money\u201d bequeathed to her and \u201c his heirs \u201d among his three daughters, excluding the granddaughter from any share or participation therein. 'Why deny her a share in this residue, and permit her to receive, as heir, one-fourth of the bank deposit, and of the United States bonds, which constituted much the larger part of his estate ? It is also to be observed, that the property to be divided among his three daughters at the widow\u2019s-death, is what remains of the \u201c personal property or money hereby devised to my said wife, Julia, <em>and </em>heirs, left unconsumed.\u201d No money or personal estate of any kind had been bequeathed to the \u201c heirs \u201d which they could avail themselves-of, or consume, during the life of the widow, as the legacies-to them were not payable until the widow\u2019s death. The testator, therefore, must have intended by this language to direct to be divided among the three daughters, the remainder left unconsumed by the widow, after deducting the-$3,005 required to pay the legacies.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">It is, however, claimed, that the last clause of the will by which the testator expressed the desire that his money remain \u201c on deposit,\u201d at interest, during the life of the widow, is inconsistent -with an intention to give the principal sum to the widow for life; and, inasmuch as the fund to be equally divided among the three daughters, at her death, was what remained unconsumed of the bequest to her <em>for </em>life, after paying the legacies created by the will, that such fund so at interest, could not, within the intention of the-testator, have been included in the sum to be so divided.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">That there is some apparent force in this claim can not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>be denied. But the same thing may be urged, and with the same propriety, in respect to money not in bank, but loaned ont to individuals, notes for which were found at the testator\u2019s residence at the time of his decease. The languageis: \u201cIt is my will that all my money, deposited <em>or otherwise, </em>is to be left on deposit, <em>at interest, </em>during the natural life-time of said wife, except the interest to be drawn and used by her as she may need.\u201d The words \u201c or otherwise,\u201d refer to money not in bank, and include money that may have been in the house of the testator when he died, as also that at interest elsewhere than in bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">The argument, therefore, that because the widow was not authorized to use any portion of the principal of the money on deposit in bank, or of the United States bonds, the same was not disposed of by the will, would reach, and subject to the same consequences, all money that was on the premises, or loaned out to any and all persons at the death of the testator; a result which no one contends for and which is manifestly opposed to the clearly expressed purpose of the testator. All \u201c moneys and credits of every description,\u201d having, by a previous provision, been given to the widow, during life or widowhood, wre think the latter clause was designed to make the use of the same of some value to her, by requiring the principal sum to remain at interest for her benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">Nor does it seem to us that the testator intended to restrict his wife to such sum to be drawn from the accumulating interest, as would merely meet her needs and necessities. He had previously given her, for life or widowhood, all his property of every kind. His subsequent direction, to keep the money at interest, \u201c the interest to be drawn and used by her as she may need,\u201d could not have been intended as a restriction or limitation upon the bequest of the <em>use </em>of the money previously given.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">That this direction is susceptible of this restricted construction is very true; but we think it better comports with the intention of the testator to be drawn from the whole context of the will, to regard the expression \u201c as she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>may need,\u201d as equivalent to \u201c as she may desire.\u201d This involves the right to use and dispose of all the interest to accrue on money loaned during the life of the widow, without reference to her personal wants or necessities.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">Whether the phrase \u201c moneys and credits of every description \u201d includes the money on deposit and the United States bonds, depends also on the intention of the testator. In <em>Boys </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>3 My. &amp; Cr. 661, a clause in the following language came before the court for interpretation, viz.: \u201c I guess there will be found sufficient in my bankers\u2019 hands to defray and discharge my debts, which I hereby desire E. M. to do, and keep the residue for her own use and pleasure.\u201d This was held, under the circumstances, and upon the whole context of the will, to amount to a gift of the general residuary personal estate to E. M.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">A testator directed the income arising from his \u201cprincipal money \u201d to be paid to his wife, while unmarried, for the support of herself and the education of his children, and at her death or marriage to be divided among the children. The testator had but little money, strictly so called, but he had a large personal estate and some freehold property. It was held thatathe whole personal property passed, including leaseholds. The Vice-Chancellor, speaking of the testator\u2019s intention, said: \u201cIn using the term \u2018principal money,\u2019 I think he intended to signify all his capital \u2014 that is, he meant a universal disposition of all his money\u2019s worth.\u201d <em>Prichard </em>v. <em>Prichard, </em>L. R. 11 Eq. Cas. 232.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">In <em>Manning </em>v. <em>Purcell, </em>7 DeGex. M. &amp; G. 55, a bequest of \u201c all my moneys \u201d was held to include the balance standing to the credit of the testator at his banker\u2019s, one upon an ordinary current account, the other secured by deposit notes bearing interest. See also, <em>Dowson </em>v. <em>Gaskoin, </em>2 Keen, 14. A testator gave to his son \"William and two others all the money left at his decease. Erom the condition of his property, this was held to include money due on promissory notes. <em>Morton </em>v. <em>Perry\u2019s ex\u2019rs, </em>1 Met. 446.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">In <em>Fulkerson </em>v. <em>Chitty, </em>4 Jones\u2019 Eq., 244, the word \u201c money,\u201d or \u201c moneys,\u201d used in a will, was held to include <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>bank stock and bonds, the context favoring such construction ; and <em>In the matter of the estate of Miller, </em>48 Cal. 165, tbe word \u201c money,\u201d as used in the will of the testator, was held to include both personal and real estate. See <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>1 Grant, 158 ; <em>Kendall </em>v. <em>Kendall, </em>4 Russ. Ch. 860.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">Cases of a similar character might be multiplied to a great extent. They all rest on the familiar principle that such construction must be given to the terms of a will as will effectuate the intention of the testator, to whatever consequences such construction may lead.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">Our conclusion is, that the widow took, and is entitled to all the personal estate, including the deposit in bank and the United States bonds, during her natural life.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">But, as respects the money on deposit or at interest, and the United States bonds, she is not authorized to expend or reduce the principal, but is entitled to the interest accruing thereon absolutely; and -what remains at the death of the widow, of the entire personal estate, exclusive of said interest, constitutes the fund from which the legacies are to be paid, the residue to be equally divided among the three daughters.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">The objection that the respective husbands of the testator\u2019s three daughters were improperly united as parties to the action is not well taken. <em>Reinheimer v. Carter, 31 </em>Ohio St. 579.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-9\">The judgment of the district court is reversed, and judgment rendered in accordance with the conclusion above stated.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
