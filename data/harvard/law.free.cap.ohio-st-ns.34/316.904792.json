E. E. Bingham, a judge of the Court of Common Pleas of Franklin county (in which the arrest was made), who, having examined the charge, proceedings, proof offered, etc., adjudged the same sufficient, and ordered the sheriff to deliver up the said Sheldon, as a fugitive from justice, to' James McKnight, the duly authorized agent of the State-of Missouri, to be. returned to the last-named state, to-answer a chai\u2019ge of embezzlement, for which he is there indicted.

Bingham were had under the act of March 23, 1875 (72 Ohio L. 79), and his action thereunder is not the subject of review by this court. Appellate jurisdiction is only conferred by statute, and there is nothing in this act giving this court such jurisdiction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b329-10\">Section 513 of the code does not reach this case, for the reason that a final order made or judgment rendered by a common pleas or superior court is one thing, while a finding of a judge, upon a question, by virtue of a special statute, is quite another thing. Matter left to the sound discretion of the court or judge will not be reviewed. 1 Ohio St. 286; 16 Ohio St. 374; 3 Ohio St. 494 ; 9 Ohio-St. 93. ,</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b330-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>Gilmore, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AC9\">The order sought to be reversed was made under authority and in pursuance of \u201c an act to regulate \u201cthe practice of the delivery of fugitives from justice, when -demanded by another state or territory\u201d (72 Ohio L. 79), which requires the fugitive, when arrested, to be taken before \u201c any <em>judge </em>of the supreme court, or any <em>judge </em>of the court of common pleas of this state, in whose district or jurisdiction such person so charged may be found, to be \u2022examined on such charge;\u201d and if, on such examination, the proof is adjudged sufficient, such <em>judge </em>is required to \u2022commit, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">The questions sought to be made arise on the bill of exceptions, and it would be a sufficient gi\u2019ound for oven\u2019uliDg the motion, to say that the bill of exceptions was taken without authority of law, and, therefore, forms no part of the record before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">A more radical question, however, arises: Is the order \u00abought to be reversed one that may be reviewed on petition in error in the supreme court?</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">The jurisdiction of this court, in proceedings in error, is prescribed by section four, title four, chapter one of the \u2022civil code. 75 Ohio Laws, 804.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">The section reads as follows : \u201cA judgment rendered, or final order made by any court, board, or tribunal mentioned 'in the last two sections, may be l\u2019eversed, vacated, or modified by the supreme court for errors appearing on the rec\u2022ord; but the petition in error, in such case, except as to a judgment or final oi\u2019der of the district court, can be filed \u25a0only by leave of the supi\u2019eme court or a judge thereof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b330-9\">\u201c The last two sections \u201d referred to are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b330-10\">\u201c Sec. 2. A judgment rendered, or a final order made, by .a probate coui\u2019t, justice of the peace, or any other tribunal, board, or officer exercising judicial functions, and <em>inferior </em>:iu jurisdiction to the court of common pleas, may be reversed, vacated or modified by the court of common pleas.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b330-11\">\u201c Sec. 3. A judgment rendered, or final order made by \u2022the court of common pleas, or any superior coui\u2019t, may be re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>versed, vacated, or modified by the district court for errors appearing on the record.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">Most clearly the order sought to be reversed was not made by a district court, or a court of common pleas, or any superior court, or by a probate court, a justice of the peace, or any other tribunal or board, and, in our opinion, it was not made by an \u201c officer exercising judicial functions, and <em>inferior </em>in jurisdiction to the court of common pleas,\u201d within the meaning of said section two.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">\n<em>Motion overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
