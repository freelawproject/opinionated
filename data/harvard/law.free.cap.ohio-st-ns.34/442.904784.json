The only facts alleged in the petition which are not denied in the answer are the following :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b455-5\">The .\u00bfEtna Iron and Nail Company was organized as a corporation, under the laws of Ohio, July 15, 1867, \u201c for the purpose of engaging in the manufacturing of iron, merchant iron, nuts, spikes, bolts, and all other kinds of iron, manufactured, including nails, hoop iron, rivets, etc., and selling the articles and things so manufactured.\u201d The capital stock was $200,000, divided into shares of $500 each. The places where the manufacturing establishment and branch thereof were required to be located were the-city of Cleveland and Newburgh township, Cuyahoga county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b455-6\">Warwick Price and William B. Price subscribed for twenty shares ($10,000) of the capital stock, and the plaintiff for twenty shares ($10,000), all to be paid in cash. The-plaintiffs are still stockholders.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b455-7\">At the time of the organization, at a meeting of the-stockholders then held, Warwick, Price &amp; Co. subscribed for sixty additional shares ($30,000), to be paid for by certain coal lands at Salineville, Columbiana county, Ohio. The directors were authorized to examine the property,, and, if in their opinion it would be for the benefit of the company, to approve the subscription, and that a. conveyance should then be executed and the stock issued.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b455-8\">On July 18, 1867, the proposition was accepted and approved, and on September 9, 1867, W. and W. B. Price-conveyed the property to the company, and received the-certificates of stock, and thereupon the company took possession of the property, improved it, and mined coal therefrom for use in the company\u2019s business.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b455-9\">At a meeting of the directors, September 4, 1868, certain proceedings were had, which were entered on the rec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>\u25a0ords of the company, as follows: \u201c Sept. 4, 1868. Board met pursuant to adjournment. All the members present. \"Whereas, this company purchased of Warwick and William B. Price certain coal lands near Salineville, Ohio, at or for the sum of $30,000, and paid for the same in the stock of the company; and, whereas, a number of stockholders are dissatisfied with the purchase, and desire that the said coal lands be conveyed back, and the stock taken up and canceled ; and the said W. and W. B. Price being willing to receive back said lands, and deliver up the stock to be canceled: Therefore, resolved, that the president be, and is hereby authorized and directed to reconvey to said Warwick and William B. Price said lands, and to receive from them said amount of stock, and cancel the same .....The above resolution was adopted by the following vote: In the affirmative, W. C. Moody, James Loveday, James Farmer, and W. B. Price; in the negative, Robert Sanderson. Then adjourned to meet 14th inst., at :9 o\u2019clock a. m. W. B.

B. Price sold their remaining stock to Loveday, and ceased to have any connection with the company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b456-11\">August 28, 1869, the .\u00bfEtna Iron and Nail Company made .an assignment of its property and assets of every kind to E. T. Hamilton for the benefit of its creditors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b456-12\">November 1, 1869, Warwick and William B. Price \u25a0conveyed the lands in controversy to Morrison Foster, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>and placed him in possession, and he still retains possession.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b457-5\">At the November term, 1869, of the Court of Common Pleas of Cuyahoga county, the plaintiffs obtained a judgment against the company for $9,370.24, which remains-unsatisfied of record; and on January 11, 1870, they caused the lands reeonveyed to the Prices to be levied on by virtue of an execution issued on the judgment, there being no other property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b457-6\">It is not admitted in the pleadings that anything is due from the Prices for improvements ; and, although it is admitted in their answer that at the time they transferred their sixty shares of stock to the company, and received a reconveyance of the land, the company was in debt, it is. averred that the company was solvent, and had assets-more than sufficient to pay all its debts. A large amount of indebtedness remains unpaid, but the Prices deny in their answer that the plaintiffs are creditors of the company. The petition contains many other averments, but they are denied in the answer of the Prices.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b457-7\">The prayer of the petition is that the judgment may be enforced against the land, and that the land be sold for the benefit of the plaintiffs and other creditors; that, in case-the land can not be so subjected to the payment of the debts, that Warwick Price, William B. Price, and others named, be compelled to account for the value of the property ; and that other and further appropriate relief be granted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b457-8\">Morrison Poster says, in his answer, that he is a purchaser-in good faith, for a full consideration, to wit, $27,000, without any notice of any adverse right or claim on the part of the plaintiffs or the company or on its behalf.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b457-9\">The company, by answer and cross-petition, adopts the petition of plaintiffs, and asks that the relief prayed for \u2022 may be granted for the benefit of the creditors of the company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b457-10\">Hamilton, as assignee, in his answer, admits the state-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>merits contained in the plaintiffs\u2019 petition, and prays for a .sale of the property in dispute, or that the Prices be compelled to account for the value of the property, for the benefit of creditors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b458-5\">The district court, at the September term, 1872, dismissed the petition of the plaintiffs and the cross-petition of the -company. The opinion of the court was reduced to writing and adopted as a finding of law and fact, as appears by .a bill of exceptions, to which the opinion is attached.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b458-6\">The errors relied on by the plaintiffs are that the finding is contrary to law, and that the court erred in denying the relief, and in dismissing the petition and cross-petition.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b458-7\">The company relies on the same errors in its cross-petition in error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b458-8\"><em>Bishop l\u00a1\u00a1 Adams, </em>for plaintiffs in error:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b458-9\">The coal land was a trust fund for creditors.

Where a party seeks a reversal for error in the finding, under section 280 of the civil code (75 Ohio L.. 645), it is essential that the record should show a substantial compliance with the statutory provision. In this case\u2019 it is sought to substitute the opinion of the court, delivered in deciding the case, for such finding. While it is possible that an opinion may be in such terms as to fulfill the requirement of the statute in that particular, this opinion is not of that character; and, in fact, the case can not be distinguished from <em>Empire Trans. Co. </em>v. <em>Blanchard, </em>31 Ohio St. 650, to which we adhere.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">2. Whatever rights the company had to maintain the suit for the purpose of avoiding the rescission, were probably transferred to the assignee by the assignment, which is general in terms; at least, the company has no greater' right in that respect than the plaintiffs. Creditors may occupy a more favorable position than stockholders (Green\u2019s Brice\u2019s Ultra Yires, 133; 38 Cal. 311, 315); but, while the rendition of the judgment in favor of the plaintiffs is admitted, it is denied that they are in fact creditors ; and the assignee is not here asking' a reversal of the judgment. The only question, then, is whether the plaintiffs, as stockholders in this insolvent corporation, are entitled to relief on the admitted facts set forth in the statement of the case. It will be observed that these facts contain no statement of fraud or unfairness, or even want of form in the transaction, but the right of the stockholders to interfere is based solely on the want of power to rescind the transaction in&gt; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>which W. &amp; W. B. Price conveyed to the company the land in controversy in payment of $30,000, in shares of the company\u2019s capital stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">Admitting the right of stockholders to proceed in such cases (Field on Corp. \u00a7 398), the validity of the contract by which the land was conveyed to the company (Green\u2019s Brice\u2019s Ultra Vires, 108), and the invalidity of the transaction by which the contract was rescinded (1 Swan &amp; Or. 309), are these stockholders, who have had notice from the first of the transaction, in a position 1o assert the invalidity of the reconveyance to W. &amp; <em>W. </em>B. Price and the cancellation of the stock?</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">It appears that on the 5th of September, 1868, when the reconveyance was made, the stock was par, and it does not appear from the facts admitted that the company was then seriously embarrassed. Though the conveyance was made at the time stated, the action in that regard was not ratified by the directors for ten days thereafter. The plaintiffs have continued to be stockholders, and one of them has acted as a director. The company suffered embarrassment and made an assignment for the benefit of creditors, and the land was sold by the Prices to an innocent purchaser; yet no step was taken during the time, nor until January 20, 1870 \u2014 a period of sixteen months \u2014 to set aside the transaction ; nor was a claim made, so far as the record discloses, at any time before the commencement of this suit, that the transaction was unfair or invalid. Under these circumstances, we may fairly say that in view of the laches of these plaintiffs, we are precluded from granting to them the relief which they ask.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
