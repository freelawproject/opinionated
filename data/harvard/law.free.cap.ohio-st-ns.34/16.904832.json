P. Buckley &amp; Co., the plaintiffs-below, were dealers in country produce at Springfield, Illinois, and desiring to make shipments of large quantities of eggs from that point to the city of New York over the Ohio and Mississippi, and the Atlantic and Great Western Railroads, applied to Mr. Stanton, the general agent of theformer road, in March, 1875, for \u201c time \u201d on shipping eggs to New York city over the roads named, who, at their request, wrote to Mr. Cochran, general freight agent of the Atlantic and Great Western Railroad, at Cincinnati, for his \u201c time \u201d from Cincinnati toNew York city, informing him that the Ohio and Mississippi Railroad could get them to Cincinnati in two days, if the Atlantic and Great Western Railroad could get them to New York city in three days, and asked Mr. Cochran if it was probable he could make that \u201c time \u201d over his road. He replied that they could do so without doubt, and to keep him fully advised by tele<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>graph of the shipments, and he would give them his special attention.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b29-5\">In pursuance of the understanding and arrangement thus made, the plaintiffs made several shipments of eggs-over the route indicated to New York city, commencing-March 25, 1875.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b29-6\">On the 81st of March, 1875, the plaintiffs shipped thirty barrels, being 2,195 dozen of eggs, from Springfield to-New York city, over the route stated, of which telegraphic-notice was sent in advance to Mr. Cochran by Mr. Stanton.. The eggs were delivered to the Atlantic and Great \"Western Railroad, at Cincinnati, on the 2d day of April following, and were retained there for five days, and did not arrive in -New York city until the 14th day of the same-month, instead of the 7th, as per arrangement. The eggs-were delivered to the consignees on the day they arrived, and by them sold on account of the plaintiffs the same-day, at the market price, which was some twelve cents-per dozen lower than the market price at the same place on the 7th of April.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b29-7\">The defendant failed to answer, and the cause was submitted to the jury on an inquiry of damages.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b29-8\">The testimony tended to prove all the facts above stated. To all of which the defendant objected, and moved' the-court to exclude it from the jury on the following grounds :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b29-9\">1. That it does not show that the defendant agreed to-guarantee the price of the eggs in New York city, nor that the eggs in question were shipped to the New York city-market.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b29-10\">2. Because the price of eggs in New York city has no bearing on the inquiry of damages to be submitted to theJU1T-</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b29-12\">The court overruled the objection, and refused to exclude the testimony from the jury, and the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b29-13\">The jury assessed as damages the difference between tho .price of eggs on the day they should have been delivered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>.and the price on the day they were delivered, for which j udgment was entered for the plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b30-5\">This judgment was affirmed in the district court, and the plaintiff in error, by this proceeding, seeks the reversal \u25a0of both judgments. \u2022</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b30-6\"><em>Durbin Ward, </em>for the motion,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ah\">made the following points :</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ao\">1. \"Where a shipment is made by a consignor on a rail-Toad, as a common carrier, it is liable for damages to the \u2022consignor only on the contract of shipment, and not otherwise.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b30-8\">2. That contract embraces no more than is in the mind \u25a0of the parties.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b30-9\">3. The law, it is true, makes certain presumptions in the .absence of proof as to what must have been in the minds of the parties, and so holds common carriers to certain pe\u2022culiar liabilities without proof of express contract. But whenever it is sought to go beyond these peculiar liabilities \u25a0of the common or statute law, then, like any other person, \u25a0the common carrier is only liable on proof express (or implied from facts, not by law), to be made out by the party -seeking to hold him liable.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b30-10\">To the claim in this case he said: 1. That, as a principle of law, the common carrier is only bound to make good \u25a0the loss which is the natural and legitimate result of his failure to comply with his contract, and not for remote damages not in the contemplation of the parties contracting. 2. That the railroad company did not agree to guarantee the price of the article shipped at the point of consignment, neither on the day that it ought to have arrived, nor on any other day. 3. The proof does not show that the goods were shipped to any market, nor to be sold at all. 4. We insist that the damages legally arising from \u25a0our negligence are to be measured by the terms of our contract, and not by the varying range of the New York market, and these damages consist in the additional cost, \u25a0if any, to the consignee by the non-arrival of the goods, and we claim that the exact point in this case has been set-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>\u25a0tied in our favor by <em>Headly </em>v. <em>Boxendale, </em>9 Exch. 341.

Rut how do these circumstances show reasonably that the profits of the mill must be stopped by an unreasonable delay in the delivery of the broken shaft by the carrier to the third person ? \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b32-10\">And the court was of the opinion that, under those circumstances, the profits of the mill, which were lost in consequence of the breach of the contract to deliver the broken-shaft, which was to be used as a pattern for a new one, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>-within a reasonable time, did not constitute such damages .as would arise naturally, or according to the usual course \u25a0of things, from the breach of. the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">But we do.not think that the facts and circumstances of the case before us bring it under the first; but, on the contrary, for reasons that will be stated below, we think it \u25a0clearly falls under the second of the alternative heads in <em>Hadley </em>v. <em>Baxendale, </em>and that the plaintiffs were entitled to recover such damages as may reasonably be supposed to have heen in the contemplation of the parties at the time they made the contract, as the probable result of the breach of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">The proposition, as thus stated, is fully sustained by an .abundance of authority. <em>Ward </em>v. <em>New York Central R. R. Co., </em>47 N. Y. 29; <em>Scott </em>v. <em>Boston and New Orleans Steamship Co. </em>106 Mass. 468 ; Sedgwick on the Measure of Damages (6 ed.), 79 ; <em>Ib., </em>note, 81; Field on Damages, sec. 375 ; <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>Colvin, </em>16 N. Y. 489; <em>Cutting </em>v. <em>Grand Trunk R. </em>W. <em>Co., </em>13 Allen, 381.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-7\">In view of the doctrine as settled by these authorities,it may be safely said that if a common carrier is chargeable with knowledge that the article carried is intended for the market, and unreasonably delays its delivery, and there is a depreciation in the market value of the article at the place of consignment, between the time it ought to have been delivered and the time it was in fact delivered, such depreciation will, in the absence of any special contract, \u25a0constitute the measure of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-8\">Was the carrier chargeable with such notice in this case ? W e think he was.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-9\">The anxiety of the plaintiffs to obtain quick time on their shipments of eggs, which was communicated to the \u25a0defendants\u2019 agent, shows that, for some reason, they regarded \u201c time \u201d as an important element in the shipments. 'The agent, for some reason, appreciated the necessity for \u25a0quick time in the contemplated shipments; .named a time within which he could carry the eggs over .his part of the \u25a0route, and requested to be kept advised by telegraph, so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>that he might give the eggs his special attention when they reached the point at which he was to receive them. Why this preconcerted arrangement ? With the knowledge of business, which their avocations must have put them in possession of, both parties knew that when large quantities of eggs were being shipped to a great city, they were-usually, if not always, intended for the market at such city. And the reason why both parties recognized the necessity of quick time in the transportation of the article, \u25a0 was that they undoubtedly knew that in this country the market value of eggs was liable to decline at the season of the year in which the shipment was made in this case, and the damages consequent upon such a decline must have been in the contemplation of both parties at the time the-contract was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">\n<em>Motion overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
