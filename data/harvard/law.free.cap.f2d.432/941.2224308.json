Citizens Casualty Co. of New York et al., 5th Cir., 1970, 431 F.2d 409, Part I.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b1000-15\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b1000-16\">John Patrick Maggard, a Florida state prisoner, appeals from the District Court\u2019s denial of his petition for a writ of habeas corpus. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-17\">The sole issue presented upon this appeal is whether the appellant was denied a fair and impartial trial because his trial court twice directed the prosecution to reopen its case, subsequent to defense motions for a directed verdict.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1000-18\">It is well established that a trial court may permit the reopening of a case in order that omitted evidence may be presented. Considerable latitude in discretion is vested in the trial court in such matters. Hale v. United States, 5th Cir., 1969, 410 F.2d 147, cert. den. 396 U.S. 902, 90 S.Ct. 216, 24 L.Ed.2d 179; Rhyne v. United States, 7th Cir., 1969, 407 F.2d 657; Morgan v. United States, 9th Cir., 1967, 380 F.2d 686, cert. den. 1968, 390 U.S. 962, 88 S.Ct. 1064, 19 L.Ed.2d 1160; also Massey v. United States, 10th Cir., 1966, 358 F.2d 782, cert. den. 385 U.S. 878, 87 S.Ct. 159, 17 L.Ed.2d 105. Moreover, the record reveals that the trial judge\u2019s suggestions were made outside the presence of the jury so that no possible prejudice could have resulted from the suggestions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-19\">We have carefully examined the record in this case, including appellant\u2019s trial transcript. We agree with the district court\u2019s holding that the trial court\u2019s actions did not substantially prejudice any federally-protected right of the appellant. Accordingly, the judgment below is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-20\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1000-13\">. Appellant has also raised two other contentions in his brief which is before this Court. Since these grounds were not presented to the district court, they will not be adjudicated upon this appeal.
