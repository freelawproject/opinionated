Mother notes that \"the trial court did not grant [her] visitation during the pendency of the initial appeal in this case\" or stay the termination order pending her appeal, as authorized by N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 7B-1003. Mother contends that \"[w]ithout an order from the trial court granting visitation pursuant to [N.C. Gen. Stat.] \u00a7 7B-1003 or an entry of a stay by the Courts, [her] failure to contact D.E.M. was not willful.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    We find Mother's argument without merit. The evidence and the trial court's findings show that Mother made no effort to contact D.E.M. and paid nothing toward his support during the six months at issue in N.C.G.S. \u00a7 7B-1111(a)(7). While it is correct that the prior order terminating her parental rights remained in effect during this period, there is no evidence that Mother sought to stay the order while her appeal was pending pursuant to N.C.G.S. \u00a7 7B-1003(a), or otherwise requested visitation with D.E.M. from the trial court or Petitioners.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 7B-1003(b) (2015). To the contrary, the evidence shows Mother made no attempt to have any form of contact with D.E.M. While Mother now suggests she \"was\n    <em>\n     prohibited\n    </em>\n    from contacting and visiting D.E.M.,\" no such prohibition was imposed. (Emphasis added). Although Mother's options were limited after she was divested of her parental rights, she was not absolved of the requirement that she take whatever measures possible to show an interest in D.E.M. Regarding an incarcerated father, this Court had held: \"Although his options for showing affection are greatly limited, the respondent will not be excused from showing\n    interest in the child's welfare by whatever means available. The sacrifices which parenthood often requires are not forfeited when the parent is in custody.\"\n    <em>\n     Whittington v. Hendren (In re Hendren)\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9190674\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/156/364/#p368\">\n     156 N.C.

By all accounts, D.E.M. is thriving in Petitioners' home. D.E.M.'s GAL recommended the termination of Mother's and Father's parental rights in order to facilitate D.E.M.'s adoption by Petitioners.

Second, the trial court erred by terminating Mother's parental rights based upon non-payment of child support under N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 7B-1111(a)(4) (2015) because there was never any child support order entered requiring Mother to pay child support to Petitioners.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    I.

Stat. \u00a7 7B-1111(a)(7), the trial court may terminate parental rights where \"[t]he parent has willfully abandoned the juvenile for at least six consecutive months immediately preceding the filing of the petition or motion[.]\" In this case, this Court filed a previous opinion on 1 March 2016 that vacated an earlier termination order due to lack of standing.\n    <em>\n     In re D.E.M.\n    </em>\n    , --- N.C.

App. LEXIS 229 (2016) (unpublished). The new petition to terminate Mother's and Father's parental rights in the present case was then filed on 8 March 2016. Thus, during the entire six months next preceding the filing of the petition for termination, Mother's parental rights had been terminated and she had no right to visit with the child. The filing of the new petition, even before the prior termination order was officially vacated, set the beginning and ending dates of the new six-month period preceding the date of filing and also ended any practical possibility that Mother may take some legal action in the gap between the first termination order and the filing of a new petition to assert her visitation rights, because there was no gap. This was a clever procedural maneuver by Petitioners' counsel, at a time when Mother had no legal representation. After the new petition was filed and counsel was appointed for her, it was too late.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    Although Mother had been awarded some limited visitation rights in the prior Chapter 50 custody proceeding, the prior termination order\n    ended those rights. At the hearing in September 2016, Mother described her attempts to exercise her visitation before her rights were terminated and claimed that Petitioners always had some sort of excuse for her not to visit. For example, they did not want her to bring her other child to her visitation with D.E.M., although the custody order did not include this limitation and her other child is D.E.M.'s half-brother. Petitioner Grandmother acknowledged that she had imposed this limitation although the order did not require it. Mother testified that since May of 2015, she had been unable to contact respondents. She never had a home phone number for Petitioners. Petitioner Grandmother acknowledged that she had changed her cell phone number about a year before the hearing, although she said that Petitioner Grandfather's number had not changed. But Mother testified that when she called Petitioner Grandfather's number in November 2015, a woman answered and told her it was not the correct number. She had been blocked from contacting Petitioner Grandmother on Facebook. Petitioners did not claim to have made any efforts to encourage Mother to have a relationship with D.E.M. or even to let her know how the child was doing. Mother felt that she was not welcome at Petitioners' home, and since they lived down a mile-long dirt road, she feared they would charge her with harassment if she tried to approach the house. She also testified: \"I've been threatened that I wasn't welcome up there. They have guns.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    On cross-examination, Petitioners' counsel stressed the fact that Mother had visitation rights under the custody order and that she had not filed an action for contempt to enforce those rights. Mother acknowledged this was true, as she had been unable to afford to pay an attorney. In closing, Petitioners' counsel stressed that Mother had not sought to see the child and acknowledged that during the relevant six months, her rights had been terminated. But he argued that the prior termination order should not change the court's analysis:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n    The Court of Appeals vacated the earlier decision. What does all that mean for [Mother]? That's more time. It's more time for her to try to come back to court and\n    try to say I've got a custody order. I've got an order that says I get to see my son on certain specified dates. And I want to do that....\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n    And the most telling thing in this case is she didn't do anything.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    The trial court also noted that Mother had visitation rights under the custody order. But Petitioners' argument and the trial court's reliance\n    on the custody order for the relevant six month period was legally incorrect. Mother did not have a custody order or any visitation rights after 4 March 2015, when her parental rights were terminated by the trial court's first order, and since the new termination proceeding was filed on 8 March 2016 before the mandate issued on this Court's opinion in\n    <em>\n     In re D.E.M.\n    </em>\n    , --- N.C.

But in\n    <em>\n     In re C.J.H.\n    </em>\n    , the father was under no legal or physical restraint or disability which could prevent him from seeing the child; the court was evaluating his \"sporadic\" efforts to have contact with the child over a period of several years, where he had made a few attempts during the relevant six month period.\n    <em>\n     Id\n    </em>\n    . at 500-03,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=772%20S.E.2d%2082\">\n     772 S.E.2d at 90-91\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The law does not support relying\n    <em>\n     solely\n    </em>\n    upon a time period prior to the six months preceding the filing of the petition for a finding of abandonment. Efforts to see a child outside of the relevant six-month period were considered only to evaluate the \"credibility and intentions\" of the parent\n    <em>\n     during\n    </em>\n    the six month period. Events outside the relevant six month period cannot be the sole basis for the termination, where the parent was legally not a parent and had no rights to assert during the relevant time. I would therefore reverse the trial court's determination that Mother willfully abandoned the child under N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 7B-1111(a)(7).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    II. Failure to pay child support\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    The other ground the trial court relied upon to terminate Mother's right was failure to pay any child support under N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 7B-1111(a)(4). Although a child support order is not necessary for the trial court to terminate a parent's rights under N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 7B-1111(a)(3) (2015), when a child \"has been placed in the custody of a county department of social services, a licensed child-placing agency, a child-caring institution, or a foster home,\" a child support order is necessary in this situation, where the child was in the legal custody of Petitioners, his grandparents. The trial court relied here upon N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 7B-1111(a)(4), which allows termination of parental rights when:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n    <em>\n     One parent\n    </em>\n    has been awarded custody of the juvenile by judicial decree or has custody by agreement of the\n    parents, and the\n    <em>\n     other parent\n    </em>\n    whose parental rights are sought to be terminated has for a period of one year or more next preceding the filing of the petition or motion willfully failed without justification to pay for the care, support, and education of the juvenile, as required by said decree or custody agreement.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    (Emphasis added)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    First, it is not clear that subsection (4) would apply here since neither parent was awarded custody of the child; the grandparents were awarded custody. But even if this subsection does apply to a case in which a non-parent has custody, it is undisputed that no child support order was ever entered. Petitioners testified that they had included a claim for child support in the custody complaint but acknowledged that no order was ever entered on child support.\n    <footnotemark>\n     4\n    </footnotemark>\n    The trial court erred in terminating Mother's parental rights on this basis.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    These were the only two bases for termination of parental rights the trial court found, and considering the evidence before the court, that is not surprising. The other unusual thing about this case is that the record does not reveal that Mother-or Father, although he did not appeal-is unfit as a parent in any way. Mother and Father, though never married, had been living together since January 2015 and continued to do so at the time of the hearing in September 2016. Mother's child from a prior relationship and their youngest child, D.E.M.'s full brother, live with them. She testified regarding the medical care she provided for both children and her older child's education. Although Mother had some periods of instability in relation to her residence several years ago, at the time of the termination hearing, she and Father shared a home and there was no evidence to indicate it is not suitable for children. Both parents were employed. Mother had a driver's license, insurance, and transportation. The only evidence of domestic violence between the parents was the incident in May 2013 which led to Petitioners' assumption of custody of D.E.M. Mother testified that they now \"get along better than we've ever gotten along.\" Petitioner Grandmother had suspicions of drug use by Mother and Father back in 2013; Mother had submitted to three drug tests under an order in the custody case and passed all three. There was no evidence of any suspicion of drug use since 2013. All of this evidence was uncontroverted.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    I agree that there were other methods Mother could have, and should have, used to enforce her rights to D.E.M. since 2014. Those methods all require representation by counsel, which Mother could not afford. She could have used other methods to contact Petitioners to seek to exercise her visitation-when the custody order was still in effect, at least. The trial court evaluated her \"excuses\" as unpersuasive, and that is the role of the trial court. But because Mother had no legal rights during the relevant six-month period, as a matter of law, her rights cannot be terminated based upon her failure to assert them during that time.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    Since I would therefore reverse the trial court's order adjudicating the existence of grounds to terminate Mother's parental rights, I dissent.\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"4\">\n    <p id=\"p-91\">\n     If Petitioners had pursued entry of an order for child support in the Chapter 50 case, it would have imposed an obligation on Father-their son-as well as Mother. The evidence showed that Petitioners also allowed Father to see D.E.M., although he did so infrequently.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
