Defendant and Allen became friends while training together prior to deployment to Afghanistan; Defendant was in the Navy and Allen was in the Marine Corps. During their time together in Afghanistan, they became \"almost like brothers.\" Allen left the military in 2011 and moved back to Mint Hill, North Carolina. Defendant left the military in early 2014, and moved into Allen's house in Mint Hill (\"the house\"). Denise Kathleen Whisman-Vazquez (\"Whisman\")\n  <footnotemark>\n   1\n  </footnotemark>\n  stopped in Mint Hill on 28 July 2014 to visit Defendant, a friend from the Navy, while on her way to Jacksonville.\n </p>\n <opinion id=\"p-8\">\n  The following alleged facts are taken from: (1) a video interview Defendant gave to police the night of 28 July 2014, which was played for the jury at the 16 June 2015 trial; (2) deposition testimony given by Whisman on 23 March 2015; and (3) Allen's testimony at trial. We present the relevant statements and testimony from all three individuals because the similarities and differences between their statements are particularly relevant to our review.\n </opinion>\n <footnote label=\"1\">\n  <p id=\"p-302\">\n   On 25 February 2014, Whisman still went by her maiden name \"Vazquez,\" but we will use Whisman throughout this opinion because she is referred to as \"Ms. Whisman\" throughout the record and transcripts.\n  </p>\n </footnote>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Defendant and Whisman were having drinks at Whisman's hotel when Defendant texted Allen and asked Allen to join them. Whisman had never met Allen, but she had heard a lot about him from Defendant, and testified: \"In fact, I [honestly] believed they were brothers.\" Allen left work at approximately 6:30 p.m. and joined Defendant and Whisman at the hotel. All three possessed valid concealed carry permits and were armed. Allen visited with Defendant and Whisman before he left to return home in his Jeep. Shortly thereafter, Defendant drove Whisman in her Jeep back to the house, and stopped on the way to purchase beer. At the house, Allen joined Defendant and Whisman on the porch and all three drank some beers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   All three continued to drink and things were, according to Allen, \"happy go lucky, joking around\" until later in the night, when Whisman stated that she wanted to go back to her hotel. Defendant stated that, because he was planning to drive Whisman back to her hotel that night, he had stopped drinking at approximately 9:30 p.m., but that Whisman was intoxicated at the time she asked to leave the house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Allen testified concerning Whisman: \"She was happy throughout the whole night, obviously became more and more intoxicated throughout the night, and she wanted to leave.\" Allen testified that because of Whisman's condition, he \"asked her to stay, stick around. I told her she could sleep [anywhere in the house], just stay here. She agreed.\" According to Allen, after the first time he asked Defendant and Whisman not to leave, they all \"continued to drink and laugh and joke and have fun.\" Allen testified that only later did Whisman again state her desire to leave, and that \"[Defendant] and [ ] Whisman decided they were going to go jump in [Whisman's] Jeep.\"\n   <strong>\n    A\n   </strong>\n   llen believed at the time Whisman attempted to leave that she was impaired, but that Defendant was not impaired. However, Allen did not want Defendant to drive anywhere at that time because Defendant had been drinking. Neither Whisman nor Defendant corroborated Allen's testimony concerning this initial encounter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Whisman testified that, after a few hours of drinking at the house, she wanted to return to her hotel room. When she told Defendant and Allen that she wanted to leave, Defendant \"was cool with it. And I guess [Allen] was okay with it until it was a reality, and then he wasn't okay with it anymore.\" She testified that Allen did not want either her or Defendant to drive because they had both been drinking, but that Defendant had stopped drinking earlier \"because he was going to drive back to the hotel, and so he got into the driver's side.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendant stated that once Whisman told him she wanted to leave, Defendant told Allen goodbye and got into the driver's seat of Whisman's Jeep, while Whisman got into the front passenger seat. After Defendant started the Jeep, Allen came \"storming out,\" and the mood of the evening, which had up until then been jovial, changed dramatically. Defendant said that Allen was screaming at them and \"it was bad.\" Defendant had the\n   Jeep in reverse, ready to leave, when Allen approached the Jeep and told Defendant to \"turn off the f*cking truck.\" Defendant claimed Allen was \"irrational.\" At this point, Defendant stated that Whisman \"started to freak, quite literally.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   According to Whisman's testimony, after she said she wanted to leave she got into the passenger side of her Jeep, \"[a]nd then [Allen] ... walked over ... and was very angry and was trying to tell [Defendant] not to drive.\" Whisman testified that Allen yelled something like \"where the f*ck do you think you're going.\" She said that Allen \"seemed very agitated that we were leaving\" and was yelling at Defendant; Defendant than \"got out of [Whisman's] Jeep and tried to calm him down.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Allen testified that he may have told Whisman at some point in time that she was \"not going to leave[,]\" but that Whisman and Defendant attempted to leave anyway. Allen testified that he was by his porch when he heard the Jeep doors \"open,\" so he \"grabbed [his] gun, met them out there.\" Allen testified that Defendant and Whisman had their guns with them, too. He stated: \"Why? I don't know. We just did.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Allen testified that it was not Defendant who was in the driver's seat; that it was Whisman who was going to drive Defendant back to the hotel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Allen testified that he went to the driver's side of Whisman's Jeep, reached into the vehicle, and retrieved the keys. He was not certain \"if [he] pulled 'em out of the ignition or if [Defendant] handed 'em to me.\" Allen testified that he might have asked Whisman \"What the f*ck are you doing?\" Allen testified he threw Whisman's keys into the woods near his recycling container, whereupon Whisman \"freaked out.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Defendant stated that, in response to Allen's behavior, he took the key out of the ignition, exited the Jeep, and tried to talk to Allen and calm him down. Defendant stated that Whisman then got out of the passenger seat, recovered a spare key from a bag in her Jeep, climbed into the driver's seat, and placed the spare key in the ignition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Whisman testified that she made it clear to Allen that she wanted to leave, but \"the more I said it, the more irritated [Allen] got, so I decided to get into the driver seat because I was bound and determined that I was going to leave.\" Whisman testified that, once she sat down, Allen \"pulled me out of the driver seat of my Jeep, lifted me out of the driver seat of my Jeep, threw me up against a tree and was screaming at me\" saying \"how dare you try to leave.\" Whisman stated that Allen's hands were \"[a]round my shoulders and neck.\" Whisman testified that she was terrified because she had been in \"a situation like that before.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   According to Defendant, after he had exited Whisman's Jeep and Whisman had gotten into the driver's seat, Allen \"came up, shoved me out of the way, grabbed [Whisman] by the hair, [and] pulled her out onto the ground.\" Defendant stated that at first, while on the ground, Whisman was laughing, perhaps thinking that Allen was joking around. However, Whisman's laughing \"infuriated\" Allen, and he grabbed Whisman and \"had her up against a tree, hand around her throat, faces nose to nose, asking her if she thought it was a f*cking joke.\" Defendant stated that at this point Whisman was \"hysterical. I'm trying to break them up, but-it might be cowardly-but I knew that he would go off. And, with her in close proximity, that would not be a very good thing.\" Defendant stated that Whisman \"got free\" and started \"backing away, down towards the pond.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   According to Whisman, Defendant \"got [Allen] away from me and was trying to calm me down[,]\" then she walked around the side of the house while Defendant and Allen were still up at her Jeep. Whisman \"just stood around on the side of the house. I was very upset and [Defendant] was calming [Allen] down.\" She testified that at one point Allen was \"crouching and calling me basically like I was his dog, telling me that it was okay, come here, patting his leg.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Allen testified that he did not remove Whisman from her Jeep, that after he threw her keys she got out herself \"and she took off screaming.\" According to Allen, \"Whisman jumped out of the Jeep, took off running down ... on the left side of the house. She screamed, 'Sam [Defendant], don't let him do this to me again.' \" Allen testified that Whisman ran in back around his house \"into the dark[.]\" Allen also denied pushing Whisman up against a tree or screaming right in her face once she was out of her Jeep. Allen testified that at that point he disarmed himself by placing his weapon on his chicken coop because \" '[o]bviously, for some reason she was afraid of me[,]' \" then he moved toward Whisman and \"tried to reason with her.\" However, Allen later testified that, after Whisman ran off, he remained standing by the chicken coop for a minute\n   then walked back to his porch. Allen told police investigators that he disarmed himself because Whisman was \"screaming she was afraid for her life.\" The State introduced photographs of Allen's handgun and magazine on top of his chicken coop, which was positioned between his house and Whisman's Jeep.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Allen testified that Whisman screamed: \"Sam [Defendant], don't let him do this to me again\" either once or twice, but mainly she was screaming: \"Help.\" Allen testified that he did not know what Whisman meant by: \"Sam [Defendant], don't let him do this to me again.\" Allen denied clapping his hands together and calling for Whisman to come back like he was calling to a dog. Allen testified that Defendant went into the woods to find Whisman, and she eventually stopped screaming.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Defendant stated that he decided to go find Whisman, and he located her near the back of the house. He stated that he was going to walk Whisman to Allen's parent's house, which was nearby, \"because I didn't have a vehicle to drive her out of there.\" Defendant walked Whisman around the house and back to the driveway \"to get back to the road\" to walk her to Allen's parent's house, but Allen came out and said: \"No, you're not going anywhere. You need to go to sleep or we're gonna have a f*cking problem.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Allen testified that while Whisman was in his back yard, and\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   after I announced that I had unloaded my gun and put it down, she still kept screaming.... I tried to reason with [her]. It had irritated me. [Defendant] had walked around the left side of the house to try to calm [her] down. I walked onto the deck. [ ] Whisman and [Defendant] walked around. I walked back out into the driveway. [Defendant] c[a]me up to the back end of my Jeep there.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Whisman testified that, after she walked beside the house, Defendant came down to where she was standing \"and tried to calm me down. He walked me back up towards the front of the house [near] my Jeep. I got back into the passenger side of the Jeep, and [Allen] started screaming at [Defendant] again, and they walked over toward [Allen's] Jeep.\" Allen testified that he remembered Defendant meeting him at the rear of his Jeep, and remembered telling Defendant to: \"Fix your bitch[,]\" and \"get her under control.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Defendant said Whisman was still hysterical, and Allen told her to \"sit down\" but she refused. Defendant stated that Allen then said to him \"you and I are going to have some words,\" and that Allen got \"in my face,\n   nose to nose, says why are you choosing this bitch over me, etc, etc.\" Defendant stated that he had his gun in his right-side waistband, so he kept his hands \"firmly in [his] pockets\" and he \"wasn't going to move them.\" Defendant stated that he did this to be non-threatening, and out of fear that Allen might either take Defendant's gun away from him, or retrieve his own gun from the chicken coop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Allen testified that he told Defendant: \"You need to tell your bitch to shut up.\" He said he called Whisman a \"bitch\" twice. Allen testified that Defendant \"chest-bumped\" him and said \" '[d]on't call her a bitch[,]' \" so Allen gave Defendant a \"right-hook ... to the face[.]\" Allen testified that he hit Defendant because Allen was just \"trying to help\" and Defendant was being \"disrespectful\" by bumping him in the chest. Allen testified that he was shorter than Defendant, but a physically \"bigger guy,\" and that he knocked Defendant\n   to the ground with \"one punch.\" Allen testified that he turned to walk back to the house but Defendant pushed him in the back, so he turned and \"I hit him again,\" and Defendant \"went down.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Defendant stated that once he and Allen were at the rear of Allen's Jeep, Allen \"chest pushed\" Defendant a few times, and asked him \"you want to go [meaning fight with Allen]?\" Allen then hit Defendant with a closed fist two times to the left side of Defendant's face. Defendant said his hands remained inside his pockets and he did not retaliate, hoping that Allen would calm down and go inside the house. Defendant stated that Allen was \"infuriated at this point[,]\" and that Defendant had seen Allen in bar fights and \"they're not pretty.\" Defendant stated about Allen: \"I can't match him physically, I just can't.\" Defendant said that he fell backwards, but not down, in response to Allen's punches.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Whisman testified that Defendant's hands were at his sides when he was talking to Allen, and when Allen punched Defendant. Whisman did not believe Defendant had done anything to provoke Allen, or \"make any type of aggressive gesture towards\" him. Whisman saw Defendant fall against Allen's Jeep, but did not see Defendant fall to the ground. Whisman further stated that because she was getting out of her Jeep to try and assist Defendant, she did not know if Allen hit Defendant a second time. As Whisman was heading over to the two men, Defendant was not fighting back, and as she got near, Allen turned his attention to her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Allen testified that, after the second time he hit Defendant, which knocked Defendant back to the ground, Whisman came up to him and said: \" 'Don't hit him. Hit me.' \" According to Allen, once Whisman approached him, \"some words were exchanged,\" and \"I got hit in ... the\n   right side of my head [by Whisman.]\" Allen testified that, in response: \"I believe I had pushed [Whisman] twice.\" He testified that first he \"gave [Whisman] a little shove to get a little bit of distance between us[,]\" but she \"stepped back into it\" so he stepped toward her and gave her another stronger push with two hands. Allen testified that Defendant was behind him at this time, that after his second push of Whisman, she ended up \"in the middle of [a] green patch\" in his yard, but that she never fell to the ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   According to Allen, after the second time he pushed Whisman: \"I heard bang bang. All I remember is going down to my knees and then bang again, and that's the round that knocked me over.\" Allen testified that Defendant screamed Allen's name just before the first shot was fired. Allen testified that the last time he saw Whisman after having been shot, she was standing about fifteen to twenty feet away from him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   According to Defendant, after Allen punched him twice, Whisman was to Defendant's left and Allen then \"changed targets\" and \"went after [Whisman] and had his hand around her throat again and leg-swept her onto the ground.\" He said this all happened very fast, and he heard a \"smack\" and Allen had Whisman on the ground. According to Defendant, Allen had \"one hand full of [Whisman's] hair,\" and had his other arm drawn back and ready to strike downwards with a balled fist.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Defendant stated that \"at this point [when Allen had Whisman on the ground] I decided that he was going to kill either of us, or at least seriously injure, so I made the split instant decision to defend myself and her.\" Defendant said he drew his weapon from his waistband, \"lined up my sights, I screamed [Allen's] name\" at least twice. \"When I lined up my shot, because I did not want to hit her, I had his full frontal chest.\" Defendant stated that he wanted to make sure he did not hit Whisman, but as he fired Allen had turned to \"deliver a strike\" to Whisman so Allen's \"back ended up to me[.]\" Defendant stated that he was standing three to seven feet from Allen when he fired, and that his weapon jammed after the third shot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Whisman testified concerning those final moments:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   [Defendant and Allen] were standing by [Allen]'s Jeep and I was watching them, and [Allen] hit [Defendant]. And [Defendant] was leaned up against the side of [Allen's] Jeep, and I got out of my Jeep to step between them. And while I was between\n   them [Allen] was screaming at me, and he pushed me to the ground and I felt my ankle pop.\n   And I buried my face in the ground and covered my head with my arms.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   [Defendant]'s back was to us when I stepped up between them because he was leaning against the Jeep, and [Allen] was facing [Defendant].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   Q. And you said that [Allen] shoved you, is that correct, of what happened next?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   Q. And with one hand, with two hands? How did he shove you?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   A. I believe he grabbed my shoulder and threw me to the ground.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   Q. And you said that you then fell to the ground and put your hands over your head; is that correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   Q. And what happened next?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   A. I was really afraid that he was going to-he was going to kill me, so I stayed in that position. And then I heard three rapid fired shots and I stood up and I thought it was me that was shot. And I looked behind me and [Allen] was on the ground calling Doc, Doc,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   I've been hit; I can't feel my legs.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Whisman testified that, when Allen threw her to the ground, she landed so hard that her \"glasses came off[,]\" then Allen \"came towards\" her. Whisman stated that she covered her head because she \"thought [Allen] was going to kick my face in.\" Whisman testified that she could not remember for certain if Allen was touching her when she heard the shots, but she did not believe he was. Whisman stated that the last thing she remembered seeing before the shots were fired was Allen \"over the top of me.\" Whisman testified that she did not believe Allen would have stopped attacking her if Defendant had not intervened.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Defendant stated that, after the shooting, the \"air [was let] out of the balloon. He was my friend again.\" Defendant was not certain Allen was\n   not a continuing threat, so he grabbed Whisman's arm and pulled her away to a safe distance, then called 911. Defendant said that Allen was crying, asked him to call 911, and asked Defendant to give him a hug. Defendant stated that he placed his weapon on the ground and went to Allen, found his wounds, and started administering first aid, which he continued doing until police arrived and took over.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Allen testified that he could not remember asking Defendant to \"[g]ive me a hug\" after he was shot, but that he did not doubt that he had said it. Whisman testified that, after the shooting, Defendant called 911 and told her to \"go inside and get his med bag.\" Defendant then administered aid to Allen until the police arrived.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   When Mint Hill Police Officer Joshua Kelly (\"Officer Kelly\") arrived at the scene of the shooting with two other officers, he first saw Defendant \"administering first aid\" to Allen. Defendant alerted Officer Kelly to the presence of his handgun seven to ten feet away by pointing and saying: \" 'The weapon is over there.' \" Defendant also pointed out where another handgun was located, and informed the officers that that weapon had not been fired. Officer Kelly testified that, after Defendant was arrested, he transported Defendant to jail, and that Defendant was not showing obvious signs of impairment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Allen was taken to the hospital, where he remained for a \"month and a half.\" The bullets remained in Allen's body, and he remained wheelchair-bound at the time of trial, unable to walk, with a diagnosis of permanent partial paralysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Mint Hill Police Detective Keith A. Mickovic (\"Detective Mickovic\") interviewed Defendant at the police department just before midnight on 28 July 2014. Defendant signed a waiver of his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights. Detective Mickovic testified, that after his nearly two hour interview with Defendant, he did not believe Defendant to be \"in the least\" intoxicated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   B. Pre-Trial Motions, Deposition of Whisman\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Relevant to this appeal, Defendant notified the State that he would be pursuing a claim\n   of defense of others. The State filed a \"Motion to Depose Witness Prior to Trial\" on 25 February 2015, claiming that Whisman was \"an essential witness,\" that the \"State intends to call the above-captioned matter for trial the week of June 14, 2015,\" and that Whisman would be \"unavailable\" to attend trial at that time because she was currently under orders of deployment lasting from 19 February 2015 until 31 December 2015. Arguing that the trial court \"has the inherent authority 'to do all things that are reasonably necessary for the proper\n   administration of justice' and [ ] Whisman's testimony is essential for the proper administration of justice in the above-captioned case[,]\" the State requested that \"the certified transcript and/or video of the deposition ... be admissible at trial in lieu of [ ] Whisman's live testimony, pursuant to NCGS \u00a7 804(b)(1), as well as NCGS \u00a7 8-85.\" In anticipation of Defendant's request that the trial be continued until Whisman's deployment ended, the State argued that her \"currently-scheduled and past international deployments suggest that, even if the State were to wait until she returns from her currently-scheduled deployment, she will\n   <em>\n    always\n   </em>\n   be in danger of being deployed overseas yet again.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Defendant responded to the State's 25 February 2015 motion on 27 February 2015, opposing the request to allow a pre-trial video deposition of Whisman's testimony, and opposing being deprived of the right to confront Whisman in person at trial. Defendant argued that the 14 June 2015 date was the first time the matter had been scheduled for trial, that Defendant \"would consent to a continuance of the trial until such time that Whisman is available[,]\" and that Defendant \"would further waive any speedy trial rights if the matter were continued.\" Defendant further argued that since Whisman had already been deployed-beginning 19 February 2015-having her return to North Carolina during deployment for a deposition would not be any different than having her return for trial. Defendant argued that \"the State does not have the authority to conduct pretrial depositions of witnesses\" without Defendant's consent, citing our Supreme Court's opinion in\n   <em>\n    State v. Hartsfield\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant disputed the State's assertion that the trial court's \"inherent authority 'to do all things that are reasonably necessary for the proper administration of justice' would ... extend to allow the prosecution to take a deposition of one of its witnesses when resetting the trial date would resolve the\n   issue.\" Defendant finally argued that to deprive him of his right to question Whisman in front of the jury, when she could be made available, violated his Sixth Amendment rights as guaranteed by the Confrontation Clause, as well as the corresponding rights guaranteed him by the North Carolina Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Judge W. Robert Bell heard the State's motion on 4 March 2015, and entered an order 9 March 2015. At the hearing, the State stated: \"I don't see how the state can get this case done without having [Whisman] here.\" The trial court ruled that because Whisman would likely be deployed out of the country \"[b]eginning in early April 2015 ... until December 2015[,]\" and because she would, after that date, remain \"in danger of being deployed overseas again[,]\" Whisman should be deposed the week of March 23 in case \"she is 'unavailable' according to NCGS \u00a7 8C-1, Rule 804(a)(5) when the matter is called for trial.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Whisman was subpoenaed, returned to North Carolina from Camp Pendleton, in California, and was deposed 23 March 2015 in the presence of Judge Carl Fox. Defendant again objected to the taking of Whisman's deposition. Following the deposition, the following discussion occurred:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   [THE STATE]: Your Honor, at this time the State would ask this hearing be terminated and ask that [ ] Whisman be allowed to go back to serving our country.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   THE COURT: All right. Do you have any objection to releasing the witness?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   [DEFENDANT'S COUNSEL]: Well, we would in light of our objections to this proceeding.\n   <em>\n    If she's under a subpoena we would ask that she not be released from her subpoena\n   </em>\n   . [Emphasis added].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   THE COURT: Well, you do agree that this terminates the deposition, though.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   [DEFENDANT'S COUNSEL]: This terminates this proceeding, yes, Your Honor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   THE COURT: All right. Then the Court notes the defendant's objection and the witness is released from her subpoena to go.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   [THE STATE]: Thank you, Your Honor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The State filed \"Notice of Intention to Admit Prior Testimony\" on 22 May 2015, \"because the State anticipate[d] Whisman being 'unavailable'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   for trial[.]\" Ten days\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   filing this notice, 1 June 2015, the State apparently deposited a subpoena in the mail, destination Darwin, Australia, demanding Whisman's appearance at trial. This matter came to trial on 15 June 2015, in front of Judge Jeffrey P. Hunt. The State filed a \"Motion\n   <em>\n    in Limine\n   </em>\n   \" that same day moving the trial court \"to allow the State to introduce the transcript and/or video recording from former testimony of [Whisman], an unavailable yet critical witness, during trial pursuant to N.C.G.S. \u00a7 8C-1, Rule 804(b)(1).\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   C. Trial\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The State's motion\n   <em>\n    in limine\n   </em>\n   was heard the morning of 15 June 2015, the first day of Defendant's trial. The State did not argue any basis in support of its motion beyond that contained in its written motion. Defendant again objected, reiterating his belief that the State had no authority to depose its witness prior to trial without Defendant's consent, that \"[a]s far as her unavailability, my understanding is that, if the request was made to her command to have her come, they would make arrangements[,]\" that Defendant had objected to Whisman being released from subpoena after her deposition, but \"she was released and we're here today[,]\" and that \"[a]ll we had to do was continue the trial ... and she would be here.\" The trial court granted the State's motion based upon the following relevant findings:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   I'm going to enter the following order. That the matter came up on motion of the State to use-I believe it's 804. Is that the rule-to use 804, testimony in the form of a video of a-of an indispensable witness who's in the military. The Court heard argument of both sides regarding the availability or unavailability of said witness. The Court finds the witness is in the military and is stationed outside of the State of North Carolina currently. May be in Australia or whereabouts may be unknown as far as where she's stationed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Based on these findings, the trial court ruled that Whisman was unavailable, and that Defendant's confrontation rights would not be violated by allowing the video of Whisman's deposition to be entered into evidence in lieu of her live testimony before the jury. Whisman did not appear at trial, and her video deposition testimony was entered into evidence in lieu of her live testimony. The evidentiary portion of Defendant's trial concluded on 18 June 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Closing arguments were delivered on 19 June 2015. In its closing argument, the State focused primarily on the following evidence. Allen\n   was unarmed when Defendant shot him three times in the back, that \"the crux of this entire case [was] did [Defendant] use excessive force\" in response to Allen's actions, thus negating any claim of defense of other. The State argued: \"Three shots to the back of an unarmed man who [D]efendant knew to be unarmed, excessive force.\" The State argued that, even if the jury believed Defendant's first shot was reasonable, the second and third shot were clearly excessive. The State argued that Defendant gave conflicting statements during his interview with Detective\n   Mickovic concerning the moments right before he shot Allen. Specifically, the State argued that Defendant first said Allen had a handful of Whisman's hair, then that Allen was standing over Whisman when he was shot, and finally, that in his written statement Defendant said Allen had his hands around Whisman's throat.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The State conceded certain evidence from Whisman and Defendant, and thereby acknowledged that Allen had not been completely truthful in his own testimony. Specifically, the State argued:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   [W]e know when the ruckus started near [Whisman]'s Jeep, both [Whisman] and [D]efendant tell us that ... Allen had [Whisman] up against the tree briefly. [D]efendant said that [Allen] had her by the throat. [Whisman] said it was sort of the shoulder/neck area. [ ] Allen did not say this happened, but, again, the two of them pretty quickly after this happened said that that's what happened, so I think you could reasonably assume that there was something like that going on.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The State informed the jury that it generally believed Whisman to be a credible witness. The State then went on to explain why it believed Whisman was screaming: \"Sam [Defendant], don't let him do this to me again.\"\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   Also on the stand, pretty significant, clearly she'd been through something like this. Remember, [ ] Allen testified he heard her saying, \"Don't let him do this to me again.\" There's no dispute [ ] Allen had never met [ ] Whisman before. They had never met once. They talked on the phone maybe a couple times, if even that.\n   <em>\n    So she was clearly going somewhere in her own mind that was not having anything to do with [ ] Allen. We know that.\n   </em>\n   (Emphasis added).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The State argued that Whisman was not pleading with Defendant to prevent Allen from assaulting her again, but was reliving some incident in her past that made her unreasonably fearful that evening.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The State told the jury to focus on Defendant's intent, arguing: \"You don't get to empty a weapon or attempt to empty a weapon in someone's back and say you weren't trying to kill them.\" The State focused on the elements of defense of another-whether it was \"reasonable\" for Defendant \"to perceive this kind of harm based on the fact that [Allen] had touched [Whisman] three times[,]\" and whether Defendant actually felt that Whisman was in imminent danger of death or great bodily harm. The State's theory on Defendant's motive to shoot Allen was revenge: \"[W]as he really thinking I just got punched twice in the face and now I've got my chance? Because remember, right before he shot [ ] Allen he'd been punched twice in the face. Didn't hit back.\" The State further argued that firing three shots at Allen constituted excessive force and, therefore, prevented Defendant from being able to rely on defense of another.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   In Defendant's closing, he focused on the testimony of Whisman, Defendant, Officer Kelly, and Detective Mickovic that Defendant was not intoxicated the night of 28 July 2014. \"[Defendant] and [Whisman] go to the Jeep and [Defendant] is going to drive because he had stopped drinking and he says that and the officers said that he was sober. He was using common sense. That makes sense, he's the designated driver. His car is back at the hotel.\" Defendant focused on the fact that Allen's own rules were that you did not mess with guns when you'd been drinking, but that when Allen went out to confront Defendant and Whisman about leaving, he picked up his handgun and brought it with him. Defendant contended that, after Allen pulled Whisman out of her Jeep and onto the ground, she laughed, and this angered Allen, who then \"takes her and puts her up against that tree and she freaks out.\" That once Defendant came to assist her, Whisman ran \"into the night, the woods, and she's screaming, 'Don't let him do this to me again.' \" Defendant recalled Allen's testimony that he didn't know what Whisman meant by \"don't let him do this to me again,\" but suggests: \"let's use our common sense. [Allen] pulls [Whisman] out of the car and puts her up against a tree. Maybe don't let [Allen] attack me again, does that make sense?\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Defendant argued that Defendant tried to remove Whisman from the scene, and thus end the altercation, but when they came around the other side of the house, Whisman\n   \"starts to scream again because [Allen] is waiting for them because he wants to stop them[.]\" Defendant further argued:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   Some things everyone agreed on, [Allen] hit [Defendant], either they had chest-bumped or [Defendant] was like this trying to reason with his brother. [Whisman] comes to\n   help [Defendant] because she's not going to sit there and watch her friend get hit. And [Allen] turns his attention to her, and he pushes her once according to her testimony, maybe twice according to [Allen], twice according to [Defendant], and she ends up on the ground. She is covering her head because she's afraid of what he is going to do. This man that she has never met has changed. Everything was fine until it's time to go. He assaults her when he pulls her from the Jeep and assaults her when he puts her up against the tree, and now it's even more vicious because he has punched and put [Defendant] on the ground and now it's her turn. The violence is escalating. And before he can inflict gross bodily injury, before he can kick her face and before he can kill her [Defendant] shoots three times.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Following the closing arguments, the trial court instructed the jury,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , on assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill inflicting serious injury, and on the lesser included offense of assault with a deadly weapon inflicting serious injury. Concerning the \"intent to kill\" element of assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill inflicting serious injury,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   the trial court instructed the jury: \"The State must prove that [D]efendant had the specific intent to kill the victim.\" \"You arrive at the intent of a person by such just and reasonable deductions from the circumstances proven as a reasonably prudent person would ordinarily draw therefrom.\" The trial court also instructed the jury on defense of another:\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   [You must] also consider whether [D]efendant's actions are excused and [D]efendant is not guilty because [D]efendant acted in defense of a third person. The State has the burden of proving from the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that [D]efendant's action was not in defense of a third person. If the circumstances would have created a reasonable belief in the mind of a person of ordinary firmness that the assault was necessary or reasonably appeared to be necessary to protect a third person from imminent death or great bodily harm and the circumstances did reasonably create such a belief in [D]efendant's\n   mind at the time [D]efendant acted, such assault would be justified-such assault would be justified by defense of a third person. You the jury determine the reasonableness of [D]efendant's belief from the circumstances appearing to [D]efendant at the time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   Now, a defendant does not have the right to use excessive force. [D]efendant had the right to use only such force as reasonably appeared necessary to [D]efendant under the circumstances to protect a third person from death or great bodily harm. In making this determination, you should consider the circumstances as you find them to have existed from the evidence, including the\n   <em>\n    size, age and strength of [D]efendant and the third person as compared to the victim\n   </em>\n   , the\n   <em>\n    fierceness of the assault, if any, upon the third person\n   </em>\n   , whether the victim had a weapon in the victim's possession\n   <em>\n    and the reputation, if any, of the victim for danger and violence\n   </em>\n   . (Emphasis added).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The jury found Defendant guilty of assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill inflicting serious injury on 19 June 2015. Defendant filed a motion for appropriate relief (\"MAR\") on 29 June 2015, then filed an amended MAR on 15 December 2015, arguing that \"the trial court erred by permitting the State to introduce a video deposition of a witness rather than calling that witness live at trial\" in violation of Defendant's rights under the North Carolina and United States Constitutions, that the trial court erred by\n   failing to instruct the jury on the doctrine of imperfect self-defense, and that there was insufficient evidence to have convicted Defendant. The trial court denied Defendant's MAR by order entered 29 February 2016. Defendant appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   II.\n   <em>\n    Analysis\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   A. Whisman's \"Unavailability\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   In Defendant's first argument, he contends the trial court erred by finding Whisman \"unavailable\" for the purposes of N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 8C-1, Rule 804(a)(5), and allowing her deposition testimony to be presented instead of requiring her live testimony at trial. Defendant further argues that depriving him of his right to confront Whisman in front of the jury violated the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution, as well as his rights under Article I, Sections 19 and 23, of the North Carolina Constitution. Defendant also contends that the\n   trial court erred in denying that portion of his amended MAR based upon the above arguments. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   1. Standards of review\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Rule 804 of the North Carolina Rules of Evidence allows prior testimony of a witness to be introduced at trial in lieu of the live testimony of that witness in certain circumstances, including:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   The following are not excluded by the hearsay rule if the declarant is unavailable as a witness:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   (1) Former Testimony.-Testimony given as a witness at another hearing of the same or a different proceeding, or in a deposition taken in compliance with law in the course of the same or another proceeding, if the party against whom the testimony is now offered ... had an opportunity and similar motive to develop the testimony by direct, cross, or redirect examination.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 8C-1, Rule 804(b) (2015). Our Supreme Court has discussed how Rule 804 limits when a witness may be declared \"unavailable,\" and the State relied upon the following condition-(5)-to argue Whisman was unavailable:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   Under the Rules of Evidence, a witness is considered \"unavailable\" when that witness:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   (5) Is absent from the hearing and the proponent of [her] statement has been unable to procure [her] attendance ... by process or other reasonable means.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   N.C.G.S. \u00a7 8C-1, Rule 804(a).

Inadequate Evidence of \"Unavailability\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Even assuming,\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   , the trial court's findings of fact and conclusions had been sufficient to support its ruling, we further hold that the evidence presented to the trial court was insufficient to support an ultimate finding of \"unavailability.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   a. Subpoena\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   The State filed a motion\n   <em>\n    in limine\n   </em>\n   on 15 June 2015, requesting the trial court allow the video of Whisman's deposition be entered into evidence and presented at trial in lieu of in-person testimony by Whisman, and the motion was heard on that date. In this motion, the State argued the following evidence relevant to Whisman's alleged \"unavailability:\"\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-113\">\n   8) [ ] Whisman is currently enlisted in the United States Navy as a Corpsman.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-114\">\n   9) Pursuant to [ ] Whisman's obligations in service to our nation, she is currently assigned to provide naval support\n   to a United States Marine Corps mission.\n   <em>\n    See Exhibit A\n   </em>\n   for a copy of [ ] Whisman's military orders.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-115\">\n   10) Since April 2015, [ ] Whisman has been deployed out of the country, and she is not scheduled to return until December 2015.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-116\">\n   11) Due to the potential threat to national security associated with revealing such information, the United States Navy, in communications with the undersigned Assistant District Attorney (\n   <em>\n    see Exhibit B\n   </em>\n   ) has indicated that it will not disclose [ ] Whisman's whereabouts.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-117\">\n   12) The undersigned Assistant District Attorney was provided with a mailing address to send a subpoena to [ ]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-118\">\n   Whisman, which was sent via registered mail (\n   <em>\n    see Exhibit C\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Exhibit C includes a copy of an undelivered subpoena signed on 28 May 2015 by an Assistant District Attorney. The addresses included on the subpoena are what appear to be Whisman's California street address, and an address for a Marine base in Australia: \"Marine Rotational Forces [sic] Darwin, 1\n   <sup>\n    st\n   </sup>\n   BN, 4\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   Marines, Unit 10126, FPO AE\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   96610-0126.\" The presence of this address on the subpoena suggests that, contrary to the State's assertions in its motions and at trial, the Navy had\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   \"indicated that it would not disclose [ ] Whisman's whereabouts,\" at least relative to the location of her overseas command.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Further, in both the 18 February 2015 and the 20 May 2015 letters from the Marine Corps indicating that Whisman would be deployed overseas and that the Marines might not be forthcoming with Whisman's particular location at any specific time, the State was provided with a singular phone number\n   for two personnel who were each identified as \"[t]he point of contact for this matter[.]\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   There is no record evidence that the State contacted either of these people.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   The sole attempt to obtain Whisman's attendance at trial appearing in the record was the \"Exhibit C\" subpoena apparently sent to Darwin, Australia shortly before trial. Further included in Exhibit C is a receipt for \"certified mail\" postmarked 1 June 2015, and an undated webpage printout from USPS.com indicating that the certified mail postmarked 1 June 2015 arrived at a Postal Service facility in Chicago in the\n   afternoon of 5 June 2015, and that \"[t]he item is currently in transit to the destination.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   The included certified mail receipt indicates that $2.80 was paid for \"Return Receipt (hardcopy),\" though the appropriate box was not checked. Further, the space on the receipt for the \"Sent To\" address was left blank. In a box marked \"Official Use\" was included \"FPO AP 96610[.]\" This \"Official Use\" entry is the only indication that the certified mail receipt is connected with the subpoena. From the record it appears that only one subpoena was sent. The \"Official Use\" entry of \"FPO AP 96610\" would seem to indicate that the single piece of certified mail was sent to Marine Rotational Force Darwin. Though \"Return Receipt (hardcopy)\" was apparently paid for, no return receipt is included in the record, suggesting the certified mail was never delivered. There is no indication of when the USPS.com tracking webpage printout was obtained. If the State obtained this tracking information right before the 15 June 2015 hearing, then the subpoena had not even reached Australia by that time. What is certain is that the subpoena-assuming that was what was included in the certified mail-was still in the United States on 5 June 2015 for a trial that was scheduled to begin the week of 14 June 2015, and which in fact commenced 15 June 2015. The State produced no evidence that its subpoena reached its destination, much less that it reached its destination in time to have been meaningful.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   b.

Had the State's subpoena by certified mail reached the proper authorities, they would have been required under the Code to respond; either by facilitating Whisman's return to North Carolina to testify at trial, or by refusing service and returning the subpoena to the State with\n   notification that service was rejected.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=32%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20720.20\">\n    32 C.F.R. \u00a7 720.20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2).

Record evidence strongly suggests that the subpoena never reached Whisman. Although the State mainly focused its argument on evidence related to the effort it took to subpoena and procure Whisman\n   <em>\n    for the 23 March 2015 deposition\n   </em>\n   , none of that evidence is relevant to our \"unavailability\" analysis, which is entirely limited to whether she could be produced\n   <em>\n    at trial\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   Defendant responded to the State's argument as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-144\">\n   Your Honor, at this time we would renew our objections, first to even the taking of the deposition.

Our analysis is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   confined to whether Whisman was unavailable for trial on the specific date of 15 June 2015, but whether Whisman was unavailable to testify at Defendant's trial, whenever that trial might have taken place, considering all relevant factors, rights, and policy considerations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   However, the trial court ruled that Whisman was \"unavailable\" for Rule 804 and Confrontation Clause purposes, and allowed Whisman's deposition testimony in lieu of her live testimony at trial, based entirely upon the following findings of fact: \"The Court finds the witness is in the military and is stationed outside of the State of North Carolina currently.

Resolution of this case almost entirely relied upon the testimonies and statements of\n   <em>\n    all three\n   </em>\n   witnesses that were present at the shooting, and Whisman was the witness most likely to have had sway with the jury; the State referred to Whisman as the \"one objective witness who was there[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-205\">\n   The jury\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   have believed Allen, Defendant, or Whisman exclusively, or it could have believed any combination of their statements. A thorough and complete examination of Whisman's and Allen's testimony at trial was therefore of paramount importance in swaying the jury to either Defendant's or the State's evidence of events. If the jury believed Allen completely, then it would have likely believed he posed no immediate threat to Whisman or Defendant at the time Defendant shot him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-206\">\n   However, if there was a reasonable possibility the jury could have been swayed to accept Defendant's statements to police in their entirety, and believed Allen's testimony in a light favorable to Defendant, it would have found the following: Allen was a man prone to bouts of violent rage, and Defendant had witnessed Allen severely beat people in the past. Even though Allen himself did not believe Defendant was drunk, Allen went into a rage when he saw that Defendant was attempting to drive Whisman back to her hotel, so he grabbed his handgun, ran to Whisman's door screaming obscenities, and managed to get the keys to Whisman's Jeep from Defendant and throw them into the woods. After Whisman retrieved her spare keys and got into the driver's seat of her Jeep, Allen shoved Defendant out of the way, \"grabbed [Whisman] by the hair, [and] pulled her out onto the ground.\" While on the ground, Whisman laughed, which \"infuriated\" Allen, causing him to grab Whisman off the grown, thrust her against a tree, and put his hands around her throat, get directly in her face, and ask her \"if she thought it was a f*ucking joke.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-207\">\n   Whisman was terrified and hysterical, and Defendant stepped between her and Allen because Defendant \"knew that [Allen] would go off. And with [Whisman] in close proximity, that could not be a very good thing.\" Whisman was \"screaming she was afraid for her life,\" screamed \"help\" many times, and screamed \" Sam [Defendant], don't let him do this to me again.\" \"Obviously ... [Whisman] was afraid of [Allen.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-208\">\n   Allen later confronted Whisman and Defendant and told them they could not leave, and that Defendant needed to \"[f]ix your bitch[,]\" and \"get her under control.\" As\n   Allen confronted Defendant, Defendant kept his hands firmly in his pants pockets because his handgun was in his waistband and he did not want appear to be a threat, or have Allen take Defendant's gun, or have Allen retrieve his own gun. Defendant was not provoking Allen, but Allen \"chest pushed\" Defendant a few times. Allen then used his right fist to hit Defendant twice in the face, and Allen was \"infuriated at [that] point[.]\" Defendant knew Allen could easily best him in a fistfight.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-209\">\n   After punching Defendant twice, Allen \"changed targets\" and \"went after [Whisman] and had his hand around her throat again and leg-swept\n   her onto the ground.\" Allen held Whisman's hair with one hand, and drew his other fist back like he was going to punch Whisman in the face. Defendant screamed Allen's name to get him to stop his assault on Whisman, but Allen did not stop. At this point, Defendant \"decided that [Allen] was going to kill either of us, or at least seriously injure, so I made a split instant decision to defend myself and her.\" Believing Whisman was in imminent danger of being brutally assaulted by a man who was too strong and proficient in fighting for Defendant to physically control, Defendant shot Allen to prevent him from seriously injuring, or even killing, Whisman. Based upon Allen's actions that evening, Whisman, too, believed that Allen was going to kill her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-210\">\n   The State itself, during its closing argument, admitted that important aspects of Defendant's story were correct, and thus Allen had credibility issues:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-211\">\n   [B]oth [Whisman] and [D]efendant tell us that ... Allen had [Whisman] up against the tree briefly. [D]efendant said that he had her by the throat. She said it was sort of the shoulder/neck area. [ ] Allen did not say this happened, but, again, the two of them pretty quickly after this happened said that that's what happened, so I think you could reasonably assume that there was something like that going on.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-212\">\n   Because Whisman's testimony was presented by video deposition, Defendant had no opportunity to cross-examine her in response to testimony and evidence that came to light at trial. The State must show beyond a reasonable doubt that Defendant's lost opportunities to fully cross-examine Whisman in front of the jury would not have affected either the jury's credibility determinations or its decisions on issues of fact in a manner that \"might have contributed to the conviction.\"\n   <em>\n    Heard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8562672\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/285/167/#p172\">\n    285 N.C. at 172\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=203%20S.E.2d%20826\">\n    203 S.E.2d at 829\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-213\">\n   The opportunity for cross-examination, protected by the Confrontation Clause, is critical for ensuring the integrity of the fact-finding process.

Being confronted with Allen's actual testimony, Whisman could have provided additional relevant testimony that was not brought forth in her deposition, which was conducted without Defendant having the benefit of the State's actual evidence at trial, including Allen's actual testimony. Had Whisman been given the opportunity to respond directly to Allen's testimony, she could have both created more doubt in the minds of the jurors concerning Allen's credibility, and could have provided additional testimony surrounding the contested issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-221\">\n   For example, Whisman could have: responded to Allen's comment that early on in the confrontation \"[o]bviously, for some reason she was afraid of me[,]\" and that later Whisman was \"screaming she was afraid for her life[,]\" by explaining why Allen made her feel that way; responded to Allen's testimony that he did not clap his hands and call Whisman like he was calling a \"dog;\" clarified why she was yelling \"help,\" if in fact she was doing so; or contested Allen's testimony that Whisman pushed Allen and hit him on the top of his head, and then came after Allen again after he pushed her away. In light of Defendant's and Allen's conflicting statements concerning Allen's actions right before Defendant shot him, Whisman, had she been able to testify at trial, could have more fully addressed those critical last moments, potentially providing more credibility and support for Defendant's version of those most relevant events.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-222\">\n   Finally, Whisman was unable to respond to Allen's testimony that she screamed: \"Sam [Defendant], don't let him do this to me again.\" The State, because Whisman did not testify at trial, was able to argue to the jury that Whisman was not asking Defendant to protect her from Allen, but was having a \"flash-back\" to some earlier unrelated assault. Not only did the State's depiction of Whisman's statement serve to potentially diminish the jury's understanding of Whisman's fear of Allen, it also served to potentially plant in the minds of the jurors that Whisman was\n   <em>\n    over-reacting\n   </em>\n   to Allen's actions in response to some prior trauma. The jury could have believed Whisman was, perhaps even sub-consciously, irrationally inflating her fear of Allen's intent in the crucial moments just before Allen was shot. The jury could have diminished or discounted Whisman's testimony that Allen threw her to the ground so hard her glasses came off, then he came after her, was \"over the top of [her]\" as she lay on the ground, and that she did not believe Allen \"was going to stop\" his assault. It was potentially critically important whether the\n   jury believed Whisman's stated beliefs that \"[Allen] was going to kick my face in[,]\" and that she \"was really afraid [Allen] was going to-he was going to kill me[,]\" were reasonable. We therefore hold that the State failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that denial of Defendant's constitutional right to confront Whisman at trial and in front of the jury had no prejudicial effect on the\n   jury's rejection of his \"defense of another\" defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-223\">\n   b.

Conclusion\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-235\">\n   We point out in response to the dissenting opinion that a new trial is granted for multiple and independent reasons, including: (1) The trial court failed to make\n   <em>\n    required\n   </em>\n   findings of fact concerning Whisman's unavailability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nobles\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"491552\" index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/357/433/#p439\">\n    357 N.C. at 440\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=584%20S.E.2d%20765\">\n    584 S.E.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   771 ;\n   <em>\n    Triplett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4697175\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/316/1/#p8\">\n    316 N.C. at 8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=340%20S.E.2d%20736\">\n    340 S.E.2d at 740-41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . (2) The evidence presented at the hearing on the State's motion\n   <em>\n    in limine\n   </em>\n   was insufficient to meet the State's burden of demonstrating Whisman's unavailability for purposes of both Rule 804(a)(5) and the Confrontation Clause.

We further hold that there were reasonable alternative methods for procuring Whisman's testimony that the State could have pursued, but did not; instead relying solely on its inadequate and belated attempt to subpoena Whisman in Australia.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 724,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6177892\" index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/390/719/#p724\">\n    88 S.Ct. at 1322\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6177892\" index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/390/719/#p724\">\n    20 L.Ed.2d at 259-60\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . These alternatives included,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , simply keeping Whisman under subpoena until trial, in light of the fact that she had been successfully served prior to 23 March 2015. (3) Neither\n   the State nor the trial court presented adequate justification for denying Defendant's request to continue the trial to a date subsequent to the end of Whisman's deployment; further, the trial court failed to even address this issue in its order granting the State's motion\n   <em>\n    in limine\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-236\">\n   Concerning the first reason for granting a new trial, the dissenting opinion agrees that the trial court failed to make the necessary findings of fact.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Triplett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4697175\" index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/316/1/#p8\">\n    316 N.C. at 8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=340%20S.E.2d%20736\">\n    340 S.E.2d at 740-41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The only action taken by the State to procure Whisman for trial was the subpoena-non-compliant with the Code service procedures-that was mailed to Australia shortly before the beginning of the trial, and which in all likelihood was never served on Whisman.

In March 2015, prior to Whisman's deployment outside the United States, the State subpoenaed Whisman, brought her to North Carolina from California, and deposed and recorded her testimony on video. Defendant's counsel was noticed and present for the deposition, and was given the unlimited opportunity to cross-examine Whisman.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-284\">\n   The evidence presented to the trial court demonstrates the State filed \"notice of intention to admit prior testimony\" on 22 May 2015 because \"the State anticipate[d] Ms. Whisman being 'unavailable' for trial.\" The State also filed a motion\n   <em>\n    in limine\n   </em>\n   at the start of the trial on 15 June 2015, which requested the trial court to allow Whisman's deposition to be entered into evidence and presented at trial in lieu of her in-person testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-285\">\n   The State's motion\n   <em>\n    in limine\n   </em>\n   asserted:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-286\">\n   9) Pursuant to Ms. Whisman's obligations in service to our nation, she is currently assigned to provide naval support to a United States Marine Corps mission.\n   <em>\n    See Exhibit A\n   </em>\n   for a copy of Ms. Whisman's military orders.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-287\">\n   10) Since April 2015, Ms. Whisman has been deployed out of the country, and she is not scheduled to return until December 2015.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-288\">\n   11) Due to the potential threat to national security associated with revealing such information, the United States Navy, in communications\n   with the undersigned Assistant District Attorney (\n   <em>\n    see Exhibit B\n   </em>\n   ) has indicated that it will not disclose Ms. Whisman's whereabouts.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-289\">\n   12) The undersigned Assistant District Attorney was provided with a mailing address to send a subpoena to Ms. Whisman, which was sent via registered mail (\n   <em>\n    see Exhibit C\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-290\">\n   The attached exhibits included two letters received from the United States Marine Corps dated 18 February 2015 and 20 May 2015. The 18 February 2015 letter confirmed Whisman's deployment between February 2015 to approximately December 2015. The 20 May 2015 letter confirmed Whisman was deployed overseas and noted \"[d]ue to the potential threat of national security, I am unable to provide you with detailed information such as location, dates, and purpose.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-291\">\n   The State received this letter prior to filing its notice of intention to admit prior testimony. A copy of the subpoena signed on 28 May 2015 by the Assistant District Attorney, along with a certified mail receipt and the USPS tracking information, were also attached as Exhibit C. The subpoena has a delivery address for a U.S. Marine Corps Base in Australia. The subpoena was mailed on 1 June 2015, more than two weeks prior to the scheduled trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-292\">\n   Generally, a witness, as opposed to a party, who is located outside of the state and particularly outside of the United States, is beyond the jurisdiction of the state and cannot be compelled to return to North Carolina by subpoena, whether served or not. As an active duty member of the armed services, Whisman could not return to North Carolina on her own choice or volition on any given date, whether she had been physically served with a subpoena, without the express permission by and her release from duty by her commanding officer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-293\">\n   Whisman's undisputed overseas deployment and the U.S. Marine Corps' refusal to disclose her exact whereabouts on national security grounds are strong indications of her unavailability as a witness in North Carolina to support the trial court's conclusion of unavailability under Rule 804. Moreover, the record demonstrates the State, in good faith, contacted the U.S. Marine Corps to confirm Whisman's deployment well prior to trial to seek her presence and received the 20 May 2015 letter in response. The State was provided an alternative address and sent the subpoena to Whisman on 1 June 2015. Only after the State received the 20 May 2015 letter regarding Whisman's overseas deployment and unknown whereabouts did the State file the notice of intention with the court to use the video-taped deposition. Based upon the record before us, the trial court properly concluded Whisman was physically unavailable as a witness at trial and correctly admitted her prior, preserved testimony to the jury at trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.C.

The State contacted the U.S. Marine Corps well in advance of trial to inquire about Whisman's whereabouts and received the 20 May 2015 letter in response. The letter confirmed Whisman was deployed overseas until approximately December 2015 and, due to national security, the U.S. Marine Corps was unable to provide the State with her exact location. The State also produced evidence demonstrating it sent Whisman a subpoena to the overseas address provided to the State.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-297\">\n   The trial court properly found Whisman was unavailable as a witness at trial.
