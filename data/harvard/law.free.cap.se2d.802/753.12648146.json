Detective Dixon began surveillance of Defendant's residence, and observed Defendant go in and out of his home \"three or four times during the day\", as well as \"several people come up to the residence and stay there for a short stint of time and leave,\" which indicated to him evidence of illegal drug trade. Detective Dixon then sent a confidential source to Defendant's residence and observed the confidential source purchase a controlled substance.\n </opinion>\n <footnote label=\"1\">\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Defendant does not appeal his convictions for possession of a firearm by a felon, possession of drug paraphernalia, or possession of marijuana up to one half ounce.\n  </p>\n </footnote>\n <summary type=\"majority\">\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Armed with this knowledge, Detective Dixon obtained and executed a warrant on Defendant's residence in the early morning hours of 2 April 2015. There, officers found Defendant and an unnamed female. Defendant was in his bed. Police located the following items in their respective locations:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   a. Bedroom nightstand next to Defendant-a Schedule I controlled substance, a .25 caliber Raven Arms pistol, marijuana, a glass jar that had the odor of marijuana inside of it, and Garcia y Vega cigar wrappers;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   b. Kitchen-digital scales, sandwich bags;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   c. Kitchen drawer-the same Schedule I controlled substance, an Oxycodone pill, and two (2) Alprazolam pills; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   d. Living room-a marijuana roach in the ashtray, and a security camera set up to observe his front yard.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At trial, Deputy Radford of the City-County Task Force testified that he identified the Alprazolam pills using the website drugs.com.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On 2 April 2015, Defendant was charged with felony possession of a firearm by a felon, misdemeanor possession of marijuana paraphernalia, felony possession of a schedule I controlled substance, misdemeanor simple possession of a schedule II controlled substance, felony maintaining a dwelling for keeping or selling controlled substances,\n   misdemeanor possession of marijuana up to one half ounce, and misdemeanor simple possession of a schedule III controlled substance. On 7 August 2015, Defendant was indicted.\n   On 7 June 2016, he was convicted of these charges, save for felony possession of a schedule I controlled substance, which was dismissed by the trial court due to a fatal variance in the proof.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Analysis\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Defendant makes two arguments on appeal to this Court. First, he asserts that the trial court committed reversible error when it denied Defendant's motion to dismiss the charge of maintaining a dwelling for lack of sufficient evidence. Second, he argues that the trial court committed plain error when it allowed Deputy Radford to opine as to the type of pills found at Defendant's home, where the basis of his identification was a visual inspection and comparison of the pills with a website.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     I. Identification of the Pills\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Defendant claims that the trial court committed plain error in allowing Officer Radford to identify the pills found in Defendant's residence as Alprazolam and Oxycodone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \"In criminal cases, an issue that was not preserved by objection noted at trial and that is not deemed preserved by rule or law without any such action nevertheless may be made the basis of an issue presented on appeal when the judicial action questioned is specifically and distinctly contended to amount to plain error.\" N.C.
