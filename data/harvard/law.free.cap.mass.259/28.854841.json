There was admitted in evidence a \"release and settlement of claim,\u201d under seal, covering this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>cause of action and signed by the plaintiff. Just above her signature there was written in the plaintiff\u2019s own handwriting, \u201cI read this release before signing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">The plaintiff testified that her signature and this statement were written by her at the request of an agent of the defendant; that her sister signed as a witness to her signature at the same time; and that she then took a substantial sum of money from the agent of the defendant. She testified further that the agent \"took some money out of his pocket and said if I would take that, and that it would help me out so far as my medical treatment went \u2014 asked me if I would take it from the Elevated to help out in paying my expenses of my physician, my doctor, whoever I had ... he produced one paper and asked me if I would sign it as a receipt for the money if I was going to take the money \u2014 would I sign that as a receipt for him.\u201d Plainly under these circumstances the release was a bar. The evidence of the plaintiff was insufficient to avoid the release. <em>McNamara </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>197 Mass. 383, 387. <em>Gold </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>244 Mass. 144. <em>Costello </em>v. <em>Hayes, </em>249 Mass. 349, 352. The case at bar is distinguishable from <em>Bliss </em>v. <em>New York Central &amp; Hudson River Railroad, </em>160 Mass. 447, <em>Rocci </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Accident Co. </em>222 Mass. 336, and similar cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
