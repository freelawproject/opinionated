There was evidence from another passenger that the car as it came near to Sullivan Street \u201cwas going pretty fast, and then it stopped; but, when it stopped, it gave such a jolt that it threw me . . . 'it was going along quite fast, and then it seemed just as it came to Sullivan Street it stopped dead, and then, when it stopped dead, it stopped so quick that it threw me, stopped with such a jolt that it threw me kind of forward\u2019; that there was an awful rumbling sound when it did stop\u201d; that her elbow \u201ccame in contact with the woodwork on the side of the long bench . . . that her grip . . . on the upright bar was loosened.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b254-3\">The ordinary jolts and jerks of a street car in starting or stopping or in going around curves or over .switches are among the usual incidents of travel in such cars, and for injuries resulting from such incidents a street railway company is not liable. <em>Work </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>207 Mass. 447, 448. <em>Walsh </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>256 Mass. 17, and cases cited. The sudden stopping of a street car is not of itself evidence of negligence, but a car may be stopped so suddenly as to furnish evidence of negligence in its management. No general rule can be laid down. Each case must be dealt with as it arises. <em>Work </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, supra. </em>In <em>Convery </em>v. <em>Eastern Massachusetts Street Railway, 252 </em>Mass. 418, the plaintiff was walking in the aisle of the car, it started with such violence that she was thrown a distance of six feet with sufficient force to break her leg; it was held that the defendant\u2019s negligence was a question for the jury to decide. In <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>207 Mass. 551, 552, the plaintiff had a \u201cfirm hold\u201d of the handles of the seat where she was standing when the car stopped; it was held she could recover. In <em>Work </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, supra, </em>the passenger <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>held the strap, and the jury could have found that this hold was enough to protect him from the ordinary jerks of the car; it was held there was evidence of the negligence of the motorman in starting the car. <em>Black </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>206 Mass. 80, 81, is governed by the same principle. The plaintiff had a firm hold of the strap and as the car stopped, the strap was wrenched from her hand. This evidence it was said \u201cshowed that the stop here in question was not of the kind incident to travel on an electric car.\u201d <em>Young </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Northern Street Railway, </em>213 Mass. 267. <em>Rust </em>v. <em>Springfield Street Railway, </em>217 Mass. 116.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-9\">In the case at bar the car was approaching a stopping place. The plaintiff prior to the accident was a strong, active woman. She had a firm hold on the iron railing. The car stopped \u201cdead . . . with such a jolt that it threw\u201d another passenger forward and threw the plaintiff five or six feet onto the floor of the car with sufficient force to break one of her bones. The case is governed by the decisions quoted. It is not governed by <em>Walsh </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, supra. </em>A jury could find that stopping a car in such manner as to break the plaintiff\u2019s hold on the railing and throw her five or six feet was evidence of negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-11\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
