While engaged in this work, he felt a soreness in his knee and got a strain. The knee within a day or two became lame and swollen. The finding of the board, to the 'effect that the employee received <em>\u201ca </em>strain and wrench in the course of this heavy lifting,\u201d cannot be pronounced without : support in the evidence. The inference that the inj ury arose out of the employment cannot be pronounced conjectural or speculative. <em>McNicol\u2019s Case, </em>215 Mass. 497, 499. <em>Sponatski\u2019s Case, </em>220 Mass. 526, 528. <em>Madden\u2019s Case, </em>222 Mass. 487.
