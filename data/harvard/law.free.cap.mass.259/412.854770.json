The plaintiff sought to recover the value of her services on a <em>quantum meruit </em>basis. The defendant\u2019s intestate died on January 8, 1924.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-9\">The defendant relied on the statute of limitations. He contended that the plaintiff could not recover for services performed before January 8, 1918. Evidence was admitted of services rendered from May, 1910. The defendant\u2019s request for the instruction, \u201cIn any event, the plaintiff can recover nothing for her services rendered the defendant\u2019s intestate earlier than January 8, 1918,\u201d was refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-10\">The case is here on a report by the trial judge. If the ruling that the statute of limitations did not apply was right and the evidence of the plaintiff\u2019s services from May 1,1910, was admissible, the verdict for the plaintiff is to stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-11\">The failure by the defendant to provide for the vesting of the property in the plaintiff was a breach of the contract. <em>Donovan </em>v. <em>Walsh, </em>238 Mass. 356, and cases cited. It is conceded that the plaintiff could not recover on the contract. <em>Donovan </em>v. <em>Walsh, supra. </em>But she could recover on the count for the value of her services rendered, even if the statute of frauds was a bar to the enforcement of the contract. There was a failure of consideration, but the plaintiff, notwithstanding this, is entitled to be compensated for the fair <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>value of the services performed. <em>Cromwell </em>v. <em>Norton, </em>193 Mass. 291. <em>Donovan </em>v. <em>Walsh, supra. Dixon </em>v. <em>Lamson, </em>242 Mass. 129. The statute of limitations did not begin to run on January 8, 1918, as contended by the defendant. The intestate died January 8, 1924. At this time there was a breach of the contract. The statute of limitations did no't begin to run until the contract was broken by the failure of the intestate to comply with its terms. The plaintiff therefore can recover for the value of her services from May, 1910, to the death of the plaintiff\u2019s intestate. <em>Morrissey </em>v. <em>Morrissey, </em>180 Mass. 480. <em>Cromwell </em>v. <em>Norton, supra. Donovan </em>v. <em>Walsh, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b441-3\">The verdict for the plaintiff in the sum of $8,093.75 is to stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
