The plaintiff\u2019s contention is, that the defendant is liable for rent after the expiration of the second year because of his failure to give notice. The parties agreed to the amount to be recovered in case the defendant is liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-9\">In <em>Dix </em>v. <em>Atkins, </em>130 Mass. 171, 172, the lease provided that \"if, before the end of the said term, neither of the said parties shall give to the other three months\u2019 notice in writing of his intention to terminate this lease at the end of the said term, the said lease shall continue in force for another term of one year.\u201d The court held that this provision could not be construed as a mere covenant for renewal; that no renewal was contemplated by the parties and that unless the notice provided for was given, the lease was to continue in force for another term of one year. \u201cIt is not a mere agreement to give a lease for a term to commence <em>in futuro, </em>but, upon the failure to give the three months\u2019 notice required to termi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>nate the lease, it continued in operation, and was a lease <em>in present\u00ed, </em>for the third year.\u201d In <em>Carlisle </em>v. <em>Weiscopf, </em>237 Mass. 183, the lease contained a provision similar to that in the case at bar. The tenant who held over after the term, contended that he was holding as a tenant at will. The court, following the principle stated in <em>Dix </em>v. <em>Atkins, supra, </em>held in effect that the lease was one from year to year until notice to terminate was given. It must therefore be held that vacating the premises before the end of the second year did not terminate the lease; that the lessee\u2019s right to terminate it on the first day of October, in the year 1925, depended upon his having given the lessor notice of his intention to terminate on or before the first of the previous August, and that the use of the word \u201cthereafter,\u201d in the clause quoted, was not intended to relieve the party who wished to terminate the lease at the end of the second year from the obligation to give such notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">The entry is to be</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">\n<em>Judgment for plaintiff in the sum of $1,198.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
