The purchase price was $5,800, of which $1,000 was paid in cash, with the assumption of a first mortgage on the property, and the giving of a second mortgage for $1,800. It is found by the master that in making the purchase the plaintiff, an aged widow, stated to the defendant\u2019s agent \u201cthat she desired a pleasant, quiet and desirable house,\u201d and before the agreement was consummated she made an examination of the premises and of the house which was \u201cas complete an examination as she wished,\u201d and the defendant did nothing to prevent a full investigation. The house was located on a bluff with a road in front of it, and on the southerly side of the road for a distance of about twenty feet the land sloped abruptly to the tracks of the Boston and Albany Railroad, which were estimated by the master to be from seventy-five to one hundred feet below the surface of the land on which the house stood, and that \u201cIt is very difficult to see the tracks from the plaintiff\u2019s house and in fact one could go over the house without being aware that a railroad was in the vicinity.\u201d \u201cBetween the premises . . . and the bluff, which leads to the railroad . . . , is a wire fence which prevents one from going to the edge of the bluff to see what is beneath.\u201d While other representations are alleged concerning the age, construction, plumbing and sewer connections of the house, they have become immaterial under the findings that as to these allegations no false or fraudulent statements were made. But even if \u201cthere was no talk about the railroad, nor did the plaintiff ask any questions about the railroad, nor were any representations made by the defendant in regard to the railroad,\u201d the master reports that \u201cthe defendant\u2019s agent did represent that the house was a pleasant and quiet one.\u201d It is also found, that \u201cthe railroad, with the smoke from the trains and the noise, materially affects <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>the value of the property. At times the smoke does come into the house and renders living in the house undesirable, and the noise from the trains, which includes the switching of trains, is not pleasant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">The question is, whether this untrue representation is sufficient to enable the plaintiff to rescind. There is no finding of bad faith on the part of the defendant, nor of an actual intent to deceive. The location of the property however and its proximity to the railroad were specially within the knowledge of the defendant who was the proper person to give such information, even if the plaintiff from her own inspection, with the opportunity of an unrestricted examination, knew the general appearance of the land when viewed from the bluff; and the master on evidence not reported finds that in fact she was deceived. A charge of fraudulent intent may be maintained by proof of a statement made of the defendant\u2019s own knowledge which is false where the statement is not matter of opinion, estimate or judgment but is susceptible of actual knowledge. It is not necessary to make any further proof of an actual intent to deceive. The defendant\u2019s statement was fraudulent. <em>Chatham Furnace Co. </em>v. Moffatt, 147 Mass. 403, 404. The plaintiff accordingly, if induced to purchase because of this representation, had the right of rescission upon discovering that it was false. <em>Matthews </em>v. <em>Bliss, </em>22 Pick. 48, 53. <em>Chatham Furnace Co. </em>v. <em>Moffatt, supra. Felker </em>v. <em>Standard Yarn Co. </em>150 Mass. 264, 266. <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>French, </em>153 Mass. 60, 62. <em>Burns </em>v. <em>Dockray, </em>156 Mass. 135, 138. <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>196 Mass. 422. <em>Montgomery Door &amp; Sash Co. </em>v. <em>Atlantic Lumber Co. </em>206 Mass. 144,154. <em>Bearse </em>v. <em>Lebowich, </em>234 Mass. 492, 498.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">Although it is alleged in the bill that in reliance thereon the plaintiff was induced to buy, the master makes no finding on the question, without proof of which fact she could not prevail. <em>Matthews </em>v. <em>Bliss, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">It follows that the interlocutory decree, confirming the report, to which no exceptions were taken, is affirmed; but the final decree must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">. <em>Ordered accordingly.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
