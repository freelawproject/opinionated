The truck was about fifteen feet long and seven and one half feet wide. It weighed about three tons, and, at the time of the accident, was loaded with nine cows. The accident occurred on Centre Street, in Boston, a public highway extending in a northerly and southerly direction, at a point nearly opposite Starr Lane, which runs into Centre Street on its easterly side but does not cross it. Centre Street is about fifty feet wide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>at this place, and located upon it are the tracks of a street railway.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">There was evidence from which it could have been found that the deceased was a bright, intelligent girl who had been accustomed to going upon the streets; that she had attended a kindergarten and a primary school over a period of four years, and for three years had been in the habit of doing errands for her mother; that on the day of the accident, after returning from school, she was sent by her mother to make a purchase at a store on the westerly side of Centre Street about opposite Starr Lane; that she came down Starr Lane \u201cnot [on] a run, more of a fast walk\u201d; that she stopped at the corner of the lane and street a moment or two and looked up and down Centre Street; that she then started around the rear of an inbound electric car and was struck by the truck on the outbound track travelling at a speed which could have been found to be from twelve to fifteen miles an hour; and that no horn was sounded or other signal given of its approach. Upon this evidence it could have been found that the deceased was in the exercise of the degree of care which reasonably would be expected of a girl of her age. No question is made that her parents were negligent in permitting her to go unattended upon the street. The electric car behind which she passed to some extent obstructed her view of the westerly side of the street. The jury viewed the place and upon all the evidence would have been warranted in finding that she was not lacking in due care. G.

Its speed, and the failure of the driver to sound its horn, could have been found to be a violation of G. L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>c. 90, \u00a7\u00a7 14, 17. <em>Rasmussen </em>v. <em>Whipple, supra. Tripp </em>v. <em>Taft, supra.
