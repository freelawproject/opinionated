Cammick,</p>\n<p id=\"ACM\">while in the employment of the Downes Lumber Company, a subscriber, on December 3, 1925, was buried under a pile of lumber which fell upon him causing his death by suffocation. He was the son of Thomas J. Cammick and Anna F. Cammick and was seventeen years and eight months old at the time of his death. It was admitted by the insurer that Anna F. Cammick, the claimant, procured a divorce from her husband May 13, 1920, and was given the custody of Robert. While the decree of divorce directed the libellee to pay a weekly sum of $5 for the support of the son, the payments were not made as decreed, but were irregular in time and amount, and when Robert went to work the arrears amounted to over $200. The employee lived with his mother, who is a stenographer earning $30 a week, and the insurer, who concedes that the death of the employee arose out of and in the course of his employment, contends, that there was no evidence warranting a finding of partial dependency of the claimant on her son\u2019s earnings. The board member, whose findings were affirmed on review, found that such dependency was proved, and, compensation having been awarded, the question for decision on the insurer\u2019s appeal is whether the finding was warranted by the evidence. G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 31, as amended by St. 1922, c. 402. <em>Hassan\u2019s Case, </em>240 Mass. 355.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-9\">The claimant was the only witness and her evidence showed, that, when Robert began to earn wages, he gave all that he received to his mother with the exception of $1.50, which sum on one occasion he retained for his own use. The combined earnings of the son and his mother constituted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>the only fund for their support, which included housing, food, clothing and incidental expenses. It is true that the record states that the claimant testified, \u201cI did not rely on his earnings for my keep.\u201d But she also said, in connection with that statement, \u201cThe money always went into a common, general fund and there were no separate accounts kept. . . . The money from this common fund was used for our support.\u201d The claimant was entitled to the wages of her minor son. <em>Tornross </em>v. <em>Auto Car Co. 220 </em>Mass. 336, 341. And the statute makes no reference to expenses incurred by the parent on the child\u2019s account as they are not to be deducted when the employee contributes to the dependent all his wages. <em>Gove\u2019s Case, </em>223 Mass. 187. <em>Dembinski\u2019s Case, </em>231 Mass. 261. The common fund was used indiscriminately for the support of the whole family, and the argument of the insurer that the claimant expended for the employee\u2019s support more than he earned and turned over to her is not of controlling importance. <em>Murphy\u2019s Case, </em>218 Mass. 278. The necessity for his aid was thereby increased, rather than diminished, and the finding, that the claimant was partially dependent upon the employee to the extent of a contribution of $894.57 out of his total earnings during the year prior to his death of $896.07 was justified. <em>McMahon\u2019s Case, </em>229 Mass. 48.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
