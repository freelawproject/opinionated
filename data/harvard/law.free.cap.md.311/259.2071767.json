Hetrick, </em>309 Md. 536, 525 A.2d 643 (1987), we held that the \u201closs of a substantial chance of survival\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>doctrine did not apply to a wrongful death action under Md.Code (1984 Repl.Vol., 1987 Cum.Supp.) Cts. &amp; Jud.Proc. Art. \u00a7 3-904. We explained that neither <em>Thomas v. Corso, </em>265 Md. 84, 288 A.2d 379 (1972), nor <em>Hicks v. United States, </em>368 F.2d 626 (4th Cir.1966), \u201ccreated ... a new tort ... [or] an additional basis for determination of damages in an existing tort\u201d on the basis of that doctrine. <em>Weimer, </em>309 Md. at 553, 525 A.2d at 652. We left for \u201canother day\u201d the question of whether Judge Sobeloff s language in <em>Hicks </em>(368 F.2d at 632) \u201cwill prove to be an augury of a burgeoning new tort or introduce a new factor for consideration of damages in tort cases producing injury or death____\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">That day has not yet come. The case now before us, tried long before our <em>Weimer, </em>went to the jury on instructions that included one based on the \u201closs of a chance\u201d doctrine. But because the evidence was insufficient to support that instruction, even assuming the doctrine exists in Maryland, we again decline to decide whether Maryland recognizes the doctrine. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">On 18 February 1978 respondent Stanley Hartman fell and fractured his right hip. Petitioner Dr. Neill Cooper operated on the hip in an effort to repair the damage. The surgery appeared to be successful; Hartman was discharged from the hospital on 16 March, still under the care of Dr. Cooper.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">A short time after his discharge, Hartman began showing symptoms of infection in his right hip. On 28 March 1978, during an outpatient consultation with Dr. Cooper, Hartman complained of persistent pain and swelling in his right leg. Dr. Cooper, apparently suspecting infection, prescribed an antibiotic.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-8\">The antibiotic had little or no effect on Hartman\u2019s pain and swelling, and his condition continued to deteriorate. On 26 April 1978 Hartman again consulted Dr. Cooper, this time complaining of throbbing pain in his right thigh and recurrent episodes of fever. Despite these symptoms Dr. Cooper did not take any serious steps to determine the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>cause of the swelling until 26 May 1978 when he administered a blood test. The test revealed a slightly elevated white blood count and an increased sedimentation rate, two indicators of infection. Despite these warning signals the doctor took no further action to diagnose or treat the infection until 27 June 1978 when he aspirated the wound and obtained bacterial cultures for testing. Tests of the cultures, however, showed no sign of bacterial infection. Over the next few months, Hartman\u2019s symptoms continued but Dr. Cooper failed to abate the infection.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">Finally in November 1978, Hartman was admitted to Johns Hopkins Hospital where he was diagnosed as suffering from osteomyelitis (an infection of the bone) in his right leg. During the course of treatment, Hartman underwent five successive surgeries involving removal of bone from his right leg. The end result was a two-inch shortening of the leg.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">Hartman and his wife (the Hartmans) filed a medical malpractice claim against Dr. Cooper and other health care providers (hereinafter collectively referred to as Dr. Cooper). Dr. Cooper was victorious in the arbitration proceeding, as he was in a subsequent trial in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County. The judgment in his favor, however, was reversed. <em>Hartman v. Cooper, </em>59 Md.App. 154, 474 A.2d 959 (1984). At a new trial the Hartmans obtained a $210,000 judgment against Dr. Cooper. The Court of Special Appeals affirmed in <em>Cooper v. Hartman, </em>No. 1615, September Term, 1985 (Md.App., filed 6 October 1986) (per curiam). We granted <em>certiorari.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">We did so because at the second trial the Hartmans asserted that Dr. Cooper\u2019s post-surgery negligence\u2014that is negligence in treating the infection\u2014had caused Hartman to lose a substantial chance of attaining a better recovery than in fact occurred. On the basis of that theory and over <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>Dr. Cooper\u2019s objections,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County (Goudy, J.) instructed that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-5\">In a civil case such as this people are presumed to have acted reasonably and that\u2019s why the burden of proof is by a preponderance of the evidence on the party asserting the claim to prove they didn\u2019t. That\u2019s a general statement of law in any negligence case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">And with regard to causation Judge Goudy gave the following charge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-7\">You are instructed that when a physician\u2019s negligent act, and I\u2019m not suggesting it was negligent, or that it was or wasn\u2019t\u2014when a physician\u2019s negligent act or negligent failure to act has terminated or lessen[ed] a person\u2019s chance of recovery the physician will not be heard to raise conjectures as to the measures of the chances that he has taken away. If there was any substantial possibility in this case of recovery or stopping or arresting the infection and the doctor negligently destroyed that chance, it is answerable. Rarely is it possible to demonstrate to an absolute certainty what would have happened had the treatment not been negligent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">The latter instruction, in effect, required the jury to apply the doctrine of \u201closs of substantial chance of survival,\u201d or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>more properly, on the facts of this case, \u201closs of a substantial chance of recovery.\u201d The instruction was based upon Judge Sobeloff\u2019s language in <em>Hicks v. United States, </em>368 F.2d 626, 632 (4th Cir.1966), which we quoted in <em>Thomas v. Corso, </em>265 Md. 84, 101-102, 288 A.2d 379, 389-390 (1972). Apparently misreading <em>Thomas, </em>the trial court erroneously concluded that we had adopted the loss of substantial chance doctrine in Maryland.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Court of Special Appeals, citing <em>Thomas, </em>found \u201cno error in the trial court\u2019s interpretation or application of the \u2018substantial possibility\u2019 standard____\u201d <em>Cooper v. Hartman, </em>No. 1615, September Term, 1985, slip op. at 3-4 (Md.App. filed 6 October 1986) (per curiam). For the reasons we now give, both courts were in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">The doctrine of \u201closs of substantial chance of survival,\u201d as it is often called, has received a great deal of attention recently from commentators.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This rule has been applied primarily in medical malpractice cases where the patient, already plagued by a pre-existing illness, injury or condition, receives medical treatment that falls below the standard of care. Ann.otation, <em>Medical Malpractice: \u201cLoss of </em>Chance\u201d <em>Causality, </em>54 A.L.R.4th 10, 17-18 (1987). In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>these cases under traditional rules, plaintiffs often encounter problems with proof of causation and are unable to demonstrate a better than even chance of recovery, absent the malpractice. King, \u201cCausation, Valuation, and Chance in Personal Injury Torts Involving Preexisting Conditions and Future Consequences,\u201d 90 Yale L.J. 1353, 1363-1364 (1981). And under traditional approaches any injury suffered by the patient \u201cwould not be compensable because it did not appear more likely than not that the patient would have survived with proper care.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">As a direct consequence of the results occasioned by the traditional approach, some courts have adopted rules designed to alleviate what they view as inequity. The various courts that have adopted these rules, however, have taken different approaches. Some have simply relaxed the standards regarding causation and allowed full compensation for an injury or death where the plaintiff demonstrated less than a 50% chance of recovery.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Others have left the traditional rules of causation intact but have viewed the loss of a chance as a way of approaching damages.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>See Weimer v. Hetrick, </em>309 Md. 536, 556, 525 A.2d 643, 653 (1987) (McAuliffe, J., concurring) (\u201ca claim under that theory [loss of substantial chance of survival] does not involve the creation of a new tort, but rather involves a redefinition of damages involved in the claim\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">Professor King in his recent law review article provides a succinct discussion of the damage approach:</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>A better method of valuation would measure a compensable chance as the percentage probability by which the defendant\u2019s tortious conduct diminished the likelihood of achieving some more favorable outcome. Under this approach, the trier of fact would continue to make the valuation, but would do so within specific guidelines and parameters set by the court.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-5\">To illustrate, consider a patient who suffers a heart attack and dies as a result. Assume that the defendant-physician negligently misdiagnosed the patient\u2019s condition, but that the patient would have had only a 40% chance of survival even with a timely diagnosis and proper care. Regardless of whether it could be said that the defendant caused the decedent\u2019s death, he caused the loss of a chance, and that chance-interest should be completely redressed in its own right. Under the proposed rule, the plaintiff\u2019s compensation for the loss of the victim\u2019s chance of surviving the heart attack would be 40% of the compensable value of the victim\u2019s life had he survived (including what his earning capacity would otherwise have been in the years following death). The value placed on the patient\u2019s life would reflect such factors as his age, health, and earning potential, including the fact that he had suffered the heart attack and the assumption that he had survived it. The 40% computation would be applied to the base figure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-6\"><em>King, supra, </em>at 1382. Thus, under Professor King\u2019s approach, an injured patient can only recover damages for the lost chance.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">Respondents argue that the \u201closs of substantial chance doctrine\u201d exists in Maryland and should be applied here, either as a new cause of action (the causation approach) or, alternatively, as a method of determining damages for a traditional tort (the damage approach). As we have already observed, we need not and do not decide whether Maryland recognizes the doctrine in any form. That is so because even if we assume, <em>arguendo, </em>the existence of the doctrine, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>the evidence in this case does not support its application under either approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">The sufficiency of evidence necessary to establish the element of causation under the causation approach is best illustrated with reference to <em>Thompson v. Sun City Community Hosp., Inc., </em>141 Ariz. 597, 688 P.2d 605 (1984). In <em>Thompson </em>the court said that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Af9\">even if the evidence permits only a finding that the defendant\u2019s negligence increased the risk of harm or deprived plaintiff of some significant chance of survival or better recovery, it is left for the jury to decide whether there is a probability that defendant\u2019s negligence was a cause in fact of the injury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-6\"><em>Thompson, </em>141 Ariz. at 606, 688 P.2d at 614. The <em>Thompson </em>court acknowledged that it, in effect, \u201cpermit[ted] the case to go to the jury on the issue of causation with less definite evidence of probability than the ordinary tort case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 607, 688 P.2d at 615. But the court reiterated that the jury was to be \u201cinstructed that they must find for the defendant unless they find a <em>probability </em>that the defendant\u2019s negligence was a cause of plaintiff\u2019s injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 607-608, 688 P.2d at 615-616 [emphasis in original].<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">At trial Hartman presented testimony of two expert witnesses, Dr. Caplan and Dr. Weiland. Both testified that Dr. Cooper departed from the standard of care by failing to diagnose and treat the infection more promptly. As to causation, the testimony was somewhat less conclusive. Dr. Weiland testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-8\">Q. Do you have an opinion, doctor, as to\u2014to a reasonable medical probability as to whether or not there is a likelihood of a better result, that it\u2019s more probable than not that Mr. Hartman would have had a better result for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>the union [of the bone] without the infection, or if it had been treated earlier?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-5\">A. <em>I think that the chances are he would have had a much better result if the infection didn\u2019t occur in the first place, </em>but if it did occur, to be treated, diagnosed and treated earlier.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-6\">Q. Do you have an opinion, doctor, as to whether or not, if it had been diagnosed in April of 1978, late April of 1978 by Dr. Cooper, for what ultimately it was determined to have been\u2014whether or not it is possible that he may have been treated purely with antibiotics without the necessity of surgery?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ah9\">A. I think it\u2019s possible that he would have been treated with antibiotics and <em>it\u2019s possible the infection would have been cured then. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AJX\">Dr. Caplan testified as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-10\">Well, acute osteomyelitis is\u2014is treated almost always with antibiotics, alone. <em>Once you have the infecting organism, you just treat [it] with prolonged, and it takes up to six weeks of high dose intravenous, usually, antibiotics and given that, you have an excellent chance of saving the bone with no subsequent surgery, and no loss of bone.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-11\">Q. And what\u2019s the importance of doing them over days rather than two months?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-12\">A. Well, if, for example, his infection was somewhere else, it\u2019s possible he could have died while we were waiting from the infection. The fact that it was in his bone meant that the only problem would be that be would suffer loss of bone, which is bad, but, I mean, <em>the longer you wait the less the chance that you can cure an infection and the earlier you treat an infection, the better the chance that you can completely cure it with</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number><em>out a lot of adjutant therapy, surgery, and a lot of other modalities that are now being used. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">This evidence falls short of what is required under the <em>Thompson </em>standard. Dr. Weiland\u2019s testimony was that \u201cits <em>possible </em>the infection would have been cured\u201d if Hartman had been properly treated. Dr. Caplan, speaking generally about treatment of osteomyelitis, said that \u201cyou treat them [the infecting organisms] with ... antibiotics and given that, you have an excellent chance of saving the bone____\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The testimony failed to demonstrate that Hartman had a \u201csubstantial possibility\u201d of a better result. And it was insufficient to permit any reasonable juror to find that Hartman had a probability of a good recovery. Thus, the loss of chance causation approach cannot be applied to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">As to the damage approach, the Hartmans have also failed to provide the requisite proof. The damage approach differs from the causation approach in that recovery under the former depends upon the quantitative measure of the lost chance. \u201cIt is well settled that compensatory damages must be proven with a reasonable degree of certainty and cannot be based upon speculation or mere conjecture.\u201d <em>Davidson v. Miller, </em>276 Md. 54, 61-62, 344 A.2d 422, 427 (1975). When we apply this language to loss of chance damages, it is apparent the proof ordinarily must be based on quantitative measures.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> But the evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>presented on behalf of the Hartmans failed to show with reasonable specificity what the extent of the lost chance was. Therefore, they cannot invoke the damage approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">Since the instruction directed the jury to apply the doctrine, it was error because the evidence did not support it under either approach. The Hartmans, nevertheless, argue that the error was not prejudicial because the evidence was sufficient to permit the jury to find in their favor under traditional tort law. Alternatively, they suggest that we remand on the issue of damages only. But the error was prejudicial, and the case must be remanded as to all issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">The traditional rule governing burden of proof as to causation in medical malpractice cases was recently stated in <em>Pierce v. Johns-Manville Sales Corp., </em>296 Md. 656, 464 A.2d 1020 (1983). There, Judge Davidson said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-7\">In Maryland, recovery of damages based on future consequences of an injury may be had only if such consequences are <em>reasonably probable </em>or <em>reasonably certain. </em>Such damages cannot be recovered if future consequences are \u201cmere possibilities.\u201d <em>Probability exists when there is more evidence in favor of a proposition than against it (a greater than 50% chance that a future consequence will occur). </em>Mere possibility exists when the evidence is anything less.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b388-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 666, 464 A.2d at 1026 [citations omitted; emphasis added].</p>\n<p id=\"b388-9\">Thus, under the traditional rule of <em>Pierce </em>(assuming the loss of chance doctrine does not apply) the Hartmans shouldered the burden of proving that Hartman had a better than 50% chance of full recovery absent the malpractice. The instruction, however, did not make this point of law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>clear to the jury. The critical portion of Judge Goudy\u2019s instruction provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-5\">When a physician\u2019s negligent act or negligent failure to act has terminated or lessened] a person\u2019s chance of recovery <em>the physician will not be heard to raise conjectures as to the measures of the chances that he has taken away. </em>If there was any <em>substantial possibility </em>... of recovery ... [he] is answerable. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">As we have seen, the <em>Pierce </em>court defined \u201cpossibility\u201d as a less than 50% chance. 296 Md. at 666, 464 A.2d at 1026. It further stated that proof as to future consequences must be in terms of probabilities (greater than 50% chance) and not possibilities (less than 50% chance). The lower court\u2019s instruction in this case, however, directed the jury to find for the Hartmans if there was \u201cany substantial possibility ... of recovery.\u201d This was in contravention of <em>Pierce. </em>In essence, the jury was instructed to find for the Hartmans even if it believed that absent the malpractice, Hartman had less than a 50% chance of complete recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">The Hartmans argue that the instructions, if read in their entirety, <em>Dean v. Redmiles, </em>280 Md. 137, 162-163, 374 A.2d 329, 343 (1977), did not direct a finding in contravention of <em>Pierce. </em>In support of their argument, the Hartmans point out that the trial judge instructed the jury that it must adhere to the preponderance of the evidence standard. The argument is unpersuasive. Although the trial judge did instruct the jury generally on the burden of proof issue, the instruction on causation in effect permitted it to depart from the preponderance standard on the causation issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">The instruction was erroneous and harmfully so. Since the error went to causation, it affected the jury\u2019s determination as to Dr. Cooper\u2019s liability. Therefore, we reverse and remand for a new trial on all issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-9\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED AND CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH DIRECTIONS TO VACATE THE JUDGMENT OF <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR ANNE ARUNDEL COUNTY AND REMAND THE CASE TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR A NEW TRIAL. RESPONDENTS TO PAY THE COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b381-9\">. In support of a motion to dismiss, the Hartmans argue that the issue regarding the correctness of the causation charge was not preserved for appeal because the record extract fails to show Dr. Cooper\u2019s exception to the instruction, as required by Md. Rule 828. We find no merit to this contention for several reasons. First, the Hartmans have failed to raise this non-preservation issue in a cross-petition for <em>certiorari. </em>Thus, the issue is not before us and we need not address it. <em>See </em>Rule 813 a and <em>Frank v. Storer, </em>308 Md. 194, 207 n. 7, 517 A.2d 1098, 1165 n. 7 (1986). Second, although the Rule 828 b.l.(b) requirements are mandatory, the decision whether to impose sanctions is discretionary. <em>Wyndham v. Haines, </em>305 Md. 269, 277 n. 7, 503 A.2d 719, 724 n. 7 (1986). We would decline to impose the sanction of dismissal for this minor infraction if the issue were before us. Moreover, the record shows that Dr. Cooper\u2019s attorney did object to the instruction and, therefore, properly preserved the issue for appeal. Md.Rule 828 c. The motion to dismiss is denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b382-8\">.
