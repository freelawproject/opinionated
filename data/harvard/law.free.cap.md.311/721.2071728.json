ORTH, Jr., Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AVG\">Specially Assigned.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">Maryland Code (1957, 1985 Repl.VoI.) Art. 101 (Workmen\u2019s Compensation), \u00a7 33(c) provides inter alia:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b840-7\">Whenever by statute, charter, ordinances, resolution, regulation or policy adopted thereunder, whether as part of a pension system or otherwise, any benefit or benefits are furnished employees of employers covered under \u00a7 21(a)(2) of this article[<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>] ..., the benefit or benefits when furnished by the employer shall satisfy and discharge pro tanto or in full as the case may be, the liability or obligation of the employer and the Subsequent Injury Fund for any benefit under this article. If any benefits so furnished are less than those provided for in this article the employer or the Subsequent Injury Fund, or both shall furnish the additional benefit as will make up the difference between <em>the benefit furnished and the similar benefit required, in this article.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b840-8\">(Emphasis added.) We are called upon to ascertain what the legislature intended by \u00a7 33(c) and to effectuate that intent by applying it to the following undisputed facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-9\">Della L. Newman, an employee of Prince George\u2019s County, sustained a work-related injury. The Workmen\u2019s Compensation Commission determined that she suffered an 80 percent industrial loss of the use of her body, 40 percent of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>which was from a preexisting condition. The Commission awarded her permanent partial disability compensation in the amount of $89 for 400 weeks. The employer was ordered to pay the first 200 weeks and the Subsequent Injury Fund the remaining 200 weeks. In the meantime, Newman had returned to work, carrying out the duties that she had performed before her injury. About two months later she elected to retire and became eligible for benefits in the amount of $77.82 per week under the county pension plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-4\">About a year and a half after Newman\u2019s retirement, the county stopped the payments ordered by the Commission on the ground that the retirement benefits were an offset against the disability award. Upon a hearing, the Commission denied the setoff. On appeal to the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County, the court entered summary judgment in favor of the county and the Fund and granted them an \u201coffset against any partial permanency award in an amount equal to [Newman\u2019s] retirement pension benefits.\u201d Newman looked to the Court of Special Appeals. It affirmed the circuit court. <em>Newman v. Subsequent Injury Fund, </em>71 Md.App. 529, 526 A.2d 631 (1987). We granted Newman\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari to resolve the question whether in the circumstances here Code, Article 101, \u00a7 33(c) operated to permit the setoff.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">We have declared time and time again that when we seek to ascertain and effectuate legislative intent, the primary source is the language of the statute itself. This language must be given its natural and ordinary signification, bearing in mind the statutory aim and objective. <em>Boulden v. Mayor and Commissioners of the Town of Elkton, </em>311 Md. 411, 413, 535 A.2d 477 (1988), citing <em>In Re Ramont K., </em>305 Md. 482, 484, 505 A.2d 507 (1986), and <em>Kaczorowski v. City of Baltimore, </em>309 Md. 505, 525 A.2d 628 (1987). If reasonably possible, a statute is to be read so that no word, phrase, clause or sentence is rendered surplusage or meaningless. <em>Prince George\u2019s Co. v. White, </em>275 Md. 314, 319, 340 A.2d 236 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b842-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>We apply these principles to \u00a7 33(c). It is perfectly clear that the word \u201csimilar\u201d in the phrase \u201cthe benefit furnished and the similar benefit required in this article,\u201d near the end of the section, qualifies the provision at the beginning of the section as to the benefits furnished employees by employers. Neither as a matter of grammar nor of substance is there a \u201creasonable distinguishing purpose to suggest that [\u201csimilar\u201d] was not intended to be implicit in the foregoing sentences.\u201d <em>Oros v. City of Baltimore, </em>56 Md. App. 685, 689, 468 A.2d 693 (1983), <em>aff'd on other grounds, City of Baltimore v. Oros, </em>301 Md. 460, 483 A.2d 748 (1984). It follows that for the setoff to come into play, the two benefits received must be \u201csimilar.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b842-4\">Newman was awarded workmen\u2019s compensation because of the impairment of the industrial use of her body as a result of her work-related injury. On the other hand, it appears that she was entitled to the benefits under the retirement plan merely because she had elected to retire after attaining a prescribed age and 20 years service with the county. The payment of these benefits had no relation whatsoever to her injury and the disability resulting therefrom. Age and length of service were not a prerequisite for her entitlement to workmen\u2019s compensation benefits; anatomical disability was not a prerequisite for her entitlement to the retirement benefits. In short, her retirement payments were an age and length of service benefit; her workmen\u2019s compensation award was a disability benefit. The two benefits were not similar and not comparable. Therefore, the offset provisions of \u00a7 33(c) were not applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">We have had occasion to visit \u00a7 33(c) in the past, and although we have never addressed the precise question before us, the tenor of the section as reflected in our opinions is that the offsetting benefits be \u201csimilar\u201d ones. In <em>Frank v. Baltimore County, </em>284 Md. 655, 399 A.2d 250 (1979), we held that it was proper to offset <em>disability </em>pension benefits against workmen\u2019s compensation benefits. We observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b843-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>Upon reading section 33 the scheme that unmistakably emerges is that the General Assembly wished to provide only <em>a single recovery for a single injury </em>for government employees covered by both a pension plan and workmen\u2019s compensation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b843-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 659, 399 A.2d 250 (emphasis added). In <em>Feissner v. Prince George\u2019s Co., </em>282 Md. 413, 384 A.2d 742 (1978), we allowed an offset when county pension <em>disability </em>benefits and workmen\u2019s compensation benefits were involved. <em>Id. </em>at 420-421, 384 A.2d 742. In <em>Mazor v. State, Dep\u2019t of Correction, </em>279 Md. 355, 369 A.2d 82 (1977), we applied the statute to an offset as to a State accidental disability pension and benefits under the workmen\u2019s compensation laws. We stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b843-5\">The cases cited by Mazor for the proposition that one may receive full workmen\u2019s compensation benefits while receiving other <em>disability payments </em>are distinguishable because all of the cases involved a meshing of federal and state programs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b843-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 363, 369 A.2d 82 (footnote omitted). We conceded that \u201cthe statutory schemes throughout the country evidence a variety of approaches____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 364, 369 A.2d 82. \u201c[B]ut,\u201d we emphasized, \u201cin any event, the express provision in our statute is controlling here.\u201d <em>Id</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"At_\">In <em>Nooe v. City of Baltimore, </em>28 Md.App. 348, 345 A.2d 134 (1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>276 Md. 748 (1976), the Court of Special Appeals observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b843-8\">It has long been the policy of the General Assembly, as expressed in its legislative enactments, that an employee of the government shall not receive workmen\u2019s compensation benefits in addition to other benefits furnished by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>employer <em>accruing by reason of an accidental injury </em>arising .out of and in the course of employment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b844-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 349, 345 A.2d 134 (emphasis added). In <em>Mazor </em>we regarded <em>Nooe </em>as persuasive, 279 Md. at 363, 369 A.2d 82, and in <em>Frank </em>we supported our construction of the legislative intent in \u00a7 33 to provide only \u201ca single recovery for a single injury for government employees covered by both a pension plan and workmen\u2019s compensation\u201d with <em>Nooe\u2019s </em>tracing of the legislative history of the section. <em>Frank, </em>284 Md. at 659, 399 A.2d 250.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">In <em>Oros v. City of Baltimore, </em>56 Md.App. 685, 468 A.2d 693, the Court of Special Appeals determined that for offset to apply under \u00a7 33(c), the two benefits must be similar. Finding that the benefits there were not similar, the court held that there could be no offset. We affirmed the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals on certiorari but we took a different tack in doing so. <em>City of Baltimore v. Oros, </em>301 Md. 460, 483 A.2d 748. We did not address the legislative intent in referring to a \u201csimilar\u201d benefit nor did we consider whether the benefits in that case were or were not \u201csimilar.\u201d We reached our decision on the rule that two distinct workmen\u2019s compensation obligations may not offset one another where there is an excess payment under the first of the two obligations. <em>Oros, </em>301 Md. at 470, 483 A.2d 748. <em>See Newman, </em>71 Md.App. at 535, 526 A.2d 631. Our <em>Oros </em>is of no guid\u00e1nce here.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">Several of our cases, <em>supra, </em>concerned with \u00a7 33(c), and the Court of Special Appeals in this case, look to 4 A. Larson, The Law of Workmen\u2019s Compensation \u00a7 97.10, at 18-9 (1979):<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b844-7\">Wage-loss legislation is designed to restore to the worker a portion, such as one-half to two-thirds, of wages lost due to the three major causes of wage-loss: physical disability, economic unemployment, and old age. The crucial operative fact is that of wage loss; the cause of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>the wage loss merely dictates the category of legislation applicable. Now if a workman undergoes a period of wage loss due to all three conditions, it does not follow that he should receive three sets of benefits simultaneously and thereby recover more than his actual wage. He is experiencing only one wage loss and, in any logical system, should receive only one wage-loss benefit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"APu\">(Footnote omitted.) Our cases, however, were all decided in the context of dual benefits accruing by reason of the same injury, that is, two benefits being paid stemming from the same cause. Moreover, Larson\u2019s endeavor to coordinate workmen\u2019s compensation and all \u201cother wage-loss benefits\u201d was not made in the light of our statute, nor does he refer to a comparable statute. Our statute focuses only on dual recoveries for a single on-the-job injury. Section 38(c) does not encompass setoffs for every type of wage-loss benefit available as Larson attempts to do. It is our statute which governs, not Larson\u2019s generalizations.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-4\">Furthermore, despite the belief of the Court of Special Appeals \u201cthat both Article 101 benefits and nondisability retirement pay are wage loss benefits,\u201d 71 Md. at 537, 526 A.2d 631, citing Larson, it is not at all clear that in Maryland public nondisability pension benefits are such wage loss benefits as Larson envisions in his comments. Benefits paid judges under a public pension plan accruing by reason of a certain age and length of service have been deemed by this Court to be \u201ca fully vested grant.\u201d <em>Chairman of Board v. Waldron, </em>285 Md. 175, 180, 401 A.2d 172 (1979). In <em>Attorney General v. Waldron, </em>289 Md. 683, 426 A.2d 929 (1981), we said: \u201cJudicial pensions serve as both inducements to enter the judiciary and rewards for years of service; it is thus a form of deferred compensation and not a substitute earnings plan.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 723, 426 A.2d 929. <em>See Clark v. Tawes, </em>187 Md. 195, 200, 49 A.2d 463 (1946). <em>See also Hargrove v. Board of Trustees, </em>310 Md. 406, 430-431, 529 A.2d 1372 (1987), McAuliffe, J., dissenting, (A judicial pension is deferred compensation). The same rationale may be applicable to benefits paid by reason of age and length of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>service under pension plans for public employees. We believe that Larson\u2019s quoted views have no material bearing on the question we here decide.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\">Our cases have made it abundantly clear, as the Court of Special Appeals discovered, that the legislature \u201cintended to preclude double-dipping into the same pot of <em>comparable </em>benefits.\u201d <em>Oros, </em>56 Md.App. at 694, 468 A.2d 693 (emphasis added). The corollary is, that when the benefits are dissimilar, the setoff provisions of \u00a7 33(c) do not apply. We have not heretofore specifically said this, but we say it today.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">We have concluded that the benefits paid Newman were not similar in the contemplation of \u00a7 33(c). It follows that the Court of Special Appeals erred in holding that the employer and the Subsequent Injury Fund were \u201centitled to a setoff pursuant to section 33(c) in the amount paid [Newman] under [her] pension.\u201d <em>Newman, </em>71 Md.App. at 537, 526 A.2d 631. We so hold.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLEES.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b840-10\">.

But there again it appears that the pension benefits were payable because of the disability entitling the recipient to workmen\u2019s compensation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b844-8\">.
