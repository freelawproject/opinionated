A second question, to be reached only if the first question is answered in the affirmative, is whether such prohibition, as applied under the circumstances of this case, is inconsistent with the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution, Art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">Yangming exists under the laws of the Republic of China and is headquartered in Taipei, Taiwan. The parties have stipulated that, at all times relevant to this case, Yangming was \u201cengaged in the transportation of goods by sea for hire in foreign commerce.\u201d Yangming is represented in the United States through its agent in New York, Solar International Shipping Agency, Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">Yangming operated a weekly container shipping service between several ports on the East Coast of the United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>States, including Baltimore, and various ports in the Far East, including ports in Korea. Yangming\u2019s agent in Baltimore was Maher Shipping, Inc. Maher\u2019s duties included husbanding cargo for Yangming\u2019s vessels and arranging port services, facilities, and supplies for Yangming\u2019s vessels while in the Port of Baltimore.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">Yangming advertised its weekly container shipping service from Baltimore in several publications that circulated among Baltimore freight forwarders, steamship agents, ocean carriers, and others engaged in foreign commerce by sea. The advertisements contained Maher\u2019s address and telephone number, and disclosed Maher\u2019s agency relationship with Yangming.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">During port visits to Baltimore, Yangming\u2019s ships expended sums of money for Maryland Bay Pilots, tugs and berthing, loading and unloading, \u00e1nd refueling and reprovisioning. Additionally, Yangming shipped cargo from other states as well as Maryland inside containers that traveled by train or truck between the various shippers\u2019 premises and the Port of Baltimore. At all times relevant to this case, Yangming had no resident agent in Maryland and had neither registered nor qualified to do business in Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">Yangming\u2019s suit against the defendant Revon Products, U.S.A. (Revon), arose out of a dispute over freight charges. In early 1982, a Korean seller agreed to ship certain goods freight prepaid to Revon in Baltimore. The goods were to travel on one of Yangming\u2019s vessels. Because of an unrelated dispute between Yangming and the seller Yangming refused to deliver the original bill of lading. Consequently, Revon could not obtain title to the goods. When the goods arrived in Baltimore in the Spring of 1982, Maher informed Revon that the seller had not paid the freight charges and that Revon would not receive the goods until it discharged this $6,000 obligation. After Revon issued a check and obtained the goods, the seller claimed that it had indeed prepaid the freight and asserted that Revon could not deduct the $6,000 from the contract price. As a result, Revon stopped payment on the check.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>In March 1985, Yangming filed a complaint in the Circuit Court for Howard County to recover the $6,000 from Revon. In a motion to dismiss, Revon asserted, <em>inter alia, </em>that the trial court lacked \u201cpersonal jurisdiction\u201d over Yangming. In its supporting memorandum, Revon explained that Yangming was \u201cdoing business\u201d in Maryland without registering or qualifying with the State Department of Assessments and Taxation, in contravention of \u00a7\u00a7 7-202 and 7-203. Hence, Revon concluded that, under \u00a7 7-301, Yangming could not maintain this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-4\">In December 1985, the trial court granted Revon\u2019s motion to dismiss. Relying on federal diversity cases, the trial judge concluded that, because Yangming\u2019s activities in the Port of Baltimore amounted to \u201cdoing business\u201d in Maryland, Yangming was required to register under \u00a7 7-202 or to qualify under \u00a7 7-203. As Yangming had taken neither step, the trial judge held that \u00a7 7-301 barred Yangming from bringing an action in any court of Maryland. The trial judge also rejected Yangming\u2019s claim that the application of \u00a7 7-301 would place an unconstitutional burden on interstate and foreign commerce. In reaching this decision, the trial judge relied on <em>Eli Lilly &amp; Co. v. Sav-On-Drugs, </em>366 U.S. 276, 81 S.Ct. 1316, 6 L.Ed.2d 288 (1961), in which the Supreme Court had held that, consistent with the Commerce Clause, a state may apply a \u201cclosed-door\u201d statute such as \u00a7 7-301 to a foreign corporation engaged in both intrastate and interstate business. Equating Yangming\u2019s activities with \u201cintrastate\u201d business, the trial judge concluded that Yangming could constitutionally be barred from suing in Maryland courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">Yangming appealed to the Court of Special Appeals. Before consideration in that court, we issued a writ of certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">As pointed out above, under \u00a7 7-301, a foreign corporation that has not complied with \u00a7 7-202 or \u00a7 7-203 is barred from suing in Maryland if the corporation \u201cis doing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>... any intrastate, int\u00e9rstate, or foreign business in this State.\u201d This Court, however, has not given \u00a7 7-301 an entirely literal construction. Specifically, this Court has not construed \u00a7 7-301 as listing three, disjunctive factors, any one of which, if present, could bar an unregistered or unqualified corporation from suing in Maryland courts. Instead, we have held that \u00a7 7-301 embodies a test for determining whether a foreign corporation is \"doing business\u201d in Maryland. <em>See G.E.M., Inc. v. Plough, Inc., </em>228 Md. 484, 486, 180 A.2d 478, 480 (1962). Under this test, \u00a7 7-301 bars an unqualified or unregistered foreign corporation from suing in Maryland courts only if the corporation is doing such a substantial amount of localized business in this State that the corporation could be deemed \u201cpresent\u201d here. <em>See, e.g., S.A.S. Personnel Consult, v. Pat-Pan, </em>286 Md. 335, 339-340, 407 A.2d 1139, 1142 (1979); <em>G.E.M., Inc. v. Plough Inc., supra, </em>228 Md. at 488-489, 180 A.2d at 480-481.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">Earlier, this test was considered analogous to the statutory \u201cdoing business\u201d test, used before the enactment of the present Long Arm Statute,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to determine whether a foreign corporation was amenable to service of process in the State. <em>See </em>Code (1957), Art. 23, \u00a7 92(b); <em>G.E.M., Inc. v. Plough Inc., supra, </em>228 Md. at 486, 180 A.2d at 480. <em>See also </em>22 Op.Att\u2019y Gen. 262, 264 (1937). The \u201cdoing business\u201d test under \u00a7 7-301, however, can no longer be considered analogous to the test for determining whether Maryland may assert personal jurisdiction over a foreign corporation. Chapter 532 of the Acts of 1967 repealed the statutory \u201cdoing business\u201d test for service of process. Moreover, under Code (1974, 1984 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 6-103(b)(l) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (the Long Arm Statute), Maryland may now assert personal jurisdiction over a foreign corporation that \u201ctransacts any business\u201d in the State. This Court has repeatedly stated that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>\u00a7 6-108 represents a legislative effort to expand the boundaries of in personam jurisdiction to the maximum extent permitted by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>Camelback Ski Corp. v. Behning, </em>307 Md. 270, 274, 513 A.2d 874 (1986), remanded on other grounds, \u2014- U.S.-, 107 S.Ct. 1341, 94 L.Ed.2d 512 (1987); <em>Mohamed v. Michael, </em>279 Md. 653, 657, 370 A.2d 551 (1977); <em>Geelhoed v. Jensen, </em>277 Md. 220, 224, 352 A.2d 818 (1976); <em>Krashes v. White, </em>275 Md. 549, 558-559, 341 A.2d 798 (1975); <em>Lamprecht v. Piper Aircraft Corp., </em>262 Md. 126, 130, 277 A.2d 272 (1971); <em>Harris v. Arlen Properties, </em>256 Md. 185, 195-196, 260 A.2d 22 (1969); <em>Vitro Electronics v. Milgray, </em>255 Md. 498, 504-505, 258 A.2d 749 (1969); <em>Gilliam v. Moog Industries, </em>239 Md. 107, 111, 210 A.2d 390 (1965). Therefore, the \u201ctransacting business\u201d test under \u00a7 6-103(b)(l) requires far fewer contacts with the State than did the \u201cdoing business\u201d test. Auerbach, <em>The \u201cLong Arm\u201d Comes to Maryland, </em>26 Md.L.Rev. 13, 33 (1966); <em>Snyder v. Hampton Industries, Inc., </em>521 F.Supp. 130, 137 (D.Md.1981), <em>aff'd, </em>758 F.2d 649 (4th Cir.1985). <em>See S.A.S. Personnel Consult v. Pat-Pan, supra, </em>286 Md. at 338 n. 1, 407 A.2d at 1141 n. 1. Consequently, under \u00a7 7-301, a foreign corporation is \u201cdoing business\u201d in Maryland only if the corporation conducts a significantly greater amount of local activity in Maryland than would be necessary for Maryland to assert personal jurisdiction over the corporation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b622-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>As previously mentioned, under our cases an unqualified or unregistered foreign corporation is barred from suing in Maryland courts only if the corporation is engaged in a substantial amount of localized business activity in Maryland. In <em>G.E.M., Inc. v. Plough Inc., supra, </em>the plaintiff, a foreign manufacturer, had neither qualified nor registered. The plaintiff had no address, property, warehouses, offices, or telephone listing in Maryland; its products entered Maryland by common carrier through interstate commerce; its salesmen operated in Maryland, but had no authority beyond solicitation; its only activities beyond solicitation involved monitoring compliance with Fair Trade agreements, the occasional distribution of promotional materials, and the allowance of discounts for participation in advertising programs. 228 Md. at 486-488, 180 A.2d at 480-481. On these facts, the Court held that the plaintiff was not \u201cdoing business\u201d in Maryland. 228 Md. at 488, 180 A.2d at 481. The Court commented that mere solicitation does not constitute \u201cdoing business.\u201d As to the conduct beyond solicitation, the Court stated: \u201c[Activities merely incidental to, and directly connected with, the solicitation of interstate sales ... do not meet the test implicit in the statutory language in question.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">The plaintiff in <em>G.E.M., Inc. v. Plough, Inc. </em>had contended that \u201cto apply the bar to a corporation doing wholly interstate business would violate the Commerce Clause.\u201d 228 Md. at 489, 180 A.2d at 481. By holding \u00a7 7-301 inapplicable in <em>G.E.M., </em>the Court avoided this contention. Nonetheless, by construing the \u201cdoing business\u201d test so as not to encompass the plaintiffs conduct, the Court indicated that a foreign corporation doing wholly interstate business is not \u201cdoing business\u201d in Maryland, at least unless a significant proportion of the corporation\u2019s activities occur in this State.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">More recently, in <em>S.A.S. Personnel Consult, v. Pat-Pan, supra, </em>we held that \u00a7 7-301 did not bar a suit brought by a nonresident personnel agency that solicited business in Maryland and referred one employee to a Maryland employer. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>In reaching this decision, the Court echoed the concern, expressed in <em>G.E.M., Inc. v. Plough, Inc., </em>that \u00a7 7-301 should not be construed to bar a suit brought by a foreign corporation not engaging in a significant amount of business in Maryland (286 Md. at 339, 407 A.2d at 1142): \u201cForeign corporations which merely solicit orders or sales, or engage in activities in Maryland directly related to such solicitation or sales, including the interstate delivery of goods, have ... been held not to be \u2018doing business.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AH3\">In sum, we have interpreted \u00a7 7-301 as allowing a foreign corporation, not engaged in significant business activity in Maryland, to maintain an action in the courts of this State despite a failure to register or qualify. We see no reason to construe \u00a7 7-301 differently in the case of a corporation that is engaged wholly in foreign commerce. Consequently, we hold that, under \u00a7 7-301, an unregistered or unqualified foreign corporation that engages in either interstate or foreign business activity in Maryland is barred from suing in the courts of this State only if the corporation also engages in localized business activity in Maryland such that it is \u201cdoing business\u201d here.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b624-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">Yangming maintains that it is engaged in transportation in international and foreign commerce, only. According to Yangming, its use of containers does not alter this conclusion, as containers are recognized as instrumentalities of foreign commerce. Additionally, Yangming contends that its activities in the Port of Baltimore, including those performed by Maher (husbanding cargo, arranging port facilities, services, supplies, etc.), and the use of tugs and pilots, are \u201cessential and necessary to ... foreign commerce\u201d and thus do not constitute \u201cdoing business.\u201d (Brief, p. 8).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">Revon, on the other hand, concedes that Yangming is engaged in foreign commerce. Revon maintains, however, that the trial court was correct in concluding that Yangming\u2019s activities in the Port of Baltimore constituted \u201cdoing business.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">In <em>S.A.S. Personnel Consult. v. Pat-Pan, supra, </em>286 Md. at 339, 407 A.2d 1139, we explained the \u201cdoing business\u201d test for purposes of \u00a7 7-301 as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-8\">\u201cA determination whether a particular act or set of acts constitutes \u2018doing business\u2019 depends upon the facts of each individual case, and rests not on a single factor, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>rather on the nature and extent of the business and activities which occur in the forum state. <em>White v. Caterpillar Tractor Co., </em>235 Md. 368, 372, 201 A.2d 856, 858 (1964); <em>State </em>ex rel. <em>Bickel v. Pennsylvania Steel Co., </em>123 Md. 212, 218, 91 A. 136, 138 (1914). Factors which may be taken into account include the payment of state taxes; the maintenance in the state of property, an office, telephone listings, employees, agents, inventory, research and development facilities, advertising, and bank accounts; the making of contracts; and the extent or pervasiveness of management functions including supervision and control of distributors and services for customers within the state. <em>Gilliam v. Moog Indus., Inc., </em>239 Md. 107, 109, 210 A.2d 390, 391 (1965); <em>White v. Caterpillar Tractor Co., </em>235 Md. at 373, 201 A.2d at 858; <em>Thomas v. Hudson Sales Corp., </em>204 Md. 450, 464-65, 105 A.2d 225, 231 (1954). Where there is solicitation, shipment of goods, and an extensive set of activities or management functions, foreign corporations have been held to be \u2018doing business.\u2019 <em>White v. Caterpillar Tractor Co., </em>235 Md. at 374, 201 A.2d at 859; <em>Thomas v. Hudson Sales Corp., </em>204 Md. at 465-66, 105 A.2d at 231.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b625-4\">In the present case, there is no dispute as to the nature or extent of Yangming\u2019s activities. Yangming has an agent and, in connection with its shipping activities, enters into contracts in Maryland. There is, however, no evidence that Yangming pays taxes, maintains property, inventory, or research and development facilities, or engages in management functions in Maryland. Yangming has no office, telephone listing, bank accounts, or employees in Maryland. Moreover, as shown by the record, Yangming\u2019s attempts to solicit business were by advertising in national publications. There was much less effort to solicit business in Maryland than that involved in <em>G.E.M., Inc. v. Plough, Inc., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">Thus, on the whole, Yangming\u2019s activities resemble the conduct that was found not to constitute \u201cdoing business\u201d in <em>G.E.M., Inc. v. Plough, Inc. </em>Admittedly, this case differs from <em>G.E.M. </em>in that the plaintiff in that case shipped <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>goods into Maryland by common carrier, while in this case, Yangming is the common carrier by which others ship their goods into Maryland. Nevertheless, we find this distinction insignificant given the insubstantiality of the local business engaged in by Yangming.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">Moreover, Yangming\u2019s activities in the Port of Baltimore are integral and necessary parts of its wholly foreign shipping business, a business obviously within the ambit of the Commerce Clause. <em>See, e.g., Japan Line Ltd. v. County of Los Angeles, </em>441 U.S. 434, 445-446, 99 S.Ct. 1813, 60 L.Ed.2d 336 (1979) (\u201ccontainers ... are instrumentalities of foreign commerce, both as a matter of fact and as a matter of law); <em>Wash. Rev. Dept. v. Stevedoring Assn., </em>435 U.S. 734, 743-744, 98 S.Ct. 1388, 1395-96, 55 L.Ed.2d 682 (1978) (stevedores are instruments of interstate commerce); <em>Foster, et al. v. Davenport, et al., </em>63 U.S. (22 How.) 244, 246, 16 L.Ed. 248 (1859) (\u201ctowing was but the prolongation of the voyage of the vessels\u201d engaged in interstate or foreign commerce). <em>See also Texas Transp. Co. v. New Orleans, </em>264 U.S. 150, 44 S.Ct. 242, 68 L.Ed. 611 (1924).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b627-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>In sum, Yangming\u2019s activities in the Port of Baltimore were necessary and essential to its activities in foreign commerce; the shipowner\u2019s activities in Baltimore were not sufficiently distinct from its foreign commerce or sufficiently localized in Maryland to constitute \u201cdoing business\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 7-301.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-4\">Because of our holding that Yangming was not doing business in Maryland within the meaning <em>of \u00a7\u00a7 </em>7-202, 7-203 and 7-301 as contraed by the Court, and thus Yangming did not have to qualify or register in order to maintain this suit, we do not directly reach the Commerce Clause issue raised by Yangming. Nevertheless, it must be acknowledged that the Court\u2019s construction and applications of the Maryland statutory scheme in this and prior cases obviously are influenced by constitutional considerations. Our construction and applications are in accord with the principle that a court will, whenever reasonably possible, construe and apply a statute to avoid casting serious doubt upon its constitutionality. <em>See, e.g., Heileman Brewing v. Stroh Brewery, </em>308 Md. 746, 763-764, 521 A.2d 1225 (1987); <em>In re Criminal Investigation No. 1-162, </em>307 Md. 674, 685, 516 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>A!2d 976, 982 (1986); <em>Davis v.

Chillum-Adelphi, </em>275 Md. 374, 383, 340 A.2d 265 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">The Supreme Court has consistently taken the position that a \u201cclosed-door\u201d statute such as \u00a7 7-301 cannot, under the Commerce Clause, apply to unregistered or unqualified foreign corporations engaged in wholly interstate or foreign commerce. <em>Allenberg Cotton Company, Inc. v.

St. Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>265 Md. 530, 290 A.2d 789 (1972), however, this Court did hold that the \u201cclosed-door\u201d statute barred a foreign corporation from bringing suit in Maryland. The plaintiff, Gibraltar, had previously qualified to do intrastate business in Maryland, but had allowed its qualification to lapse. The Court held that, absent evidence to the contrary, it would presume that Gibraltar was still doing business in Maryland. 265 Md. at 535, 290 A.2d at 792. Thus, the Court itself dismissed Gibraltar\u2019s appeal. <em>Id. </em>at 536, 290 A.2d at 793. <em>Compare J.I. Case Credit Corp. v.

The phrase in \u00a7 7-301, \"doing ... any intrastate, interstate, or foreign business,\u201d contains terms used in \u00a7\u00a7 7-202 and 7-203. Under \u00a7 7-202, a foreign corporation must register before doing any \u201cinterstate or foreign business\u201d in Maryland. Under \u00a7 7-203, a foreign corporation must qualify before doing any \"intrastate business\u201d in Maryland. Thus, it has been suggested that, by construing \u00a7 7-301 as embodying essentially a \u201cdoing business\u201d test, the Court has negated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>the distinction drawn in \u00a7\u00a7 7-202 and 7-203 between \"doing any interstate or foreign business\u201d and \"doing any intrastate business.\u201d <em>See Turner v. Smalis, Inc., </em>622 F.Supp. 248, 249 (D.Md.1985). This may not be entirely correct. Obviously, because \u00a7 7-203 refers only to \"intrastate business,\u201d a foreign corporation need not qualify if it is doing only interstate or foreign business. On the other hand, \u00a7 7-202 plainly refers to \u201cinterstate or foreign business.\" Our decision in <em>G.E.M., Inc. v. Plough, Inc., supra, </em>however, suggests that \u00a7 7-202 does not require a foreign corporation to register if it is engaged wholly in interstate or foreign commerce <em>and </em>if there are no substantial activities localized in Maryland. Nonetheless, a foreign corporation, engaged in interstate commerce, but with significant activities localized in Maryland, might properly be required to register under \u00a7 7-202 and the Commerce Clause, depending upon circumstances. <em>See </em>the discussion in L. Tribe, <em>American Constitutional Law, </em>\u00a7 6-14 (2d ed. 1988). <em>Compare Allenberg Cotton Co., Inc. v.

In the <em>Texas Transp. Co. </em>case, the Supreme Court, invalidating a license requirement imposed upon a corporation employed by the owners of vessels engaged exclusively in interstate or foreign commerce, described these activities as follows (264 U.S. at 151-152, 44 S.Ct. at 242):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-6\">\u201cDefendant was regularly employed as agent for four steamship lines, under a contract fixing its compensation on the basis of commissions, calculated upon the gross amount of freight charges collected by it for each company. In addition, defendant occasionally represented other ship owners. All were exclusively engaged in interstate or foreign commerce, and defendant\u2019s business was confined solely to representing principals so engaged in such commerce. The service rendered consisted of soliciting and engaging cargo, nominating ships for carrying it, arranging for its delivery on the wharf, issuing bills of lading under the name of ship owner or charterer, arranging for stevedores for loading and discharging cargo, collecting freight charges, paying ships\u2019 disbursements, attending to immigration service and assisting generally in matters of local customs and regulations. Freight moneys collected, after deducting commissions, were remitted to the owners or charterers. As such agent, defendant was authorized to solicit cargo and quote <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>freight rates and to issue receipts in the name of its principal for cargo delivered on the wharf.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-6\">\u201cUpon these facts the trial court held that defendant\u2019s business was local in character and subject to the tax. Upon appeal, this judgment was affirmed by the State Supreme Court. 152 La. 497 [93 So. 751].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-7\">\"The State Supreme Court thus stated the necessity and character of the agent\u2019s duties:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-8\">\u201c\u2018The business of steamship agents is an extensive business in New Orleans, as it is in every large seaport. As a separate or an independent business, it is a result of the development of the country\u2019s commerce with foreign nations and among the several states. In the early days, when time was not so much the object or subject of economy as it is today, every ship\u2019s captain, for his own ship, discharged the duties and rendered the services for which local steamship agents are employed nowadays. But it would be impracticable now for a ship\u2019s captain to remain with his ship in port long enough to attend to the many matters which the local steamship agents can and do attend to for a ship at sea or in a foreign port. The business of steamship agents is therefore a necessary adjunct to commerce on the high seas.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b628-5\">. We note that our application of \u00a7 7-301 in this case is consistent with numerous decisions throughout the country.

In the motion to dismiss, and the order granting the motion, Revon and the circuit court chiefly relied on two federal cases. <em>Gkiafis v.

The <em>Gkiafis </em>case did not involve Maryland\u2019s \"closed-door\u201d statute; instead, it was concerned with the assertion of jurisdiction over a foreign corporation and the \u201cminimum contacts\u201d standard of <em>International Shoe Co. v.

The <em>Egan </em>case, while it did involve the registration requirement, relied upon cases dealing with the assertion of Maryland jurisdiction over foreign corporations. As discussed early in this opinion, however, the standards for assertion of jurisdiction under the present Long Arm Statute and the criteria for doing business under \u00a7\u00a7 7-202, 7-203 and 7-301, are different.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
