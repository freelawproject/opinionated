Section 4-506 permits the \u201chousehold member\u201d against whom the temporary protective order has been filed to be heard on the question of whether the court should issue a final protective order. That section also authorizes the court to \u201cgrant a protective order to stop the abuse\u201d if it finds \u201cby clear and convincing evidence that the alleged abuse has occurred.\u201d Violation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>protective orders may be punished under \u00a7 4-507 by contempt, criminal prosecution, imprisonment or fine or both.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">Nancy Barbee, a Baltimore City resident, filed a \u201cPetition for Protection Against Domestic Violence\u201d in the District Court of Maryland, sitting in Baltimore City, against Joseph Barbee, her husband. According to the pleadings, the husband then resided in Henderson, Maryland, rather than in the family home in Baltimore City. The wife alleged that the husband struck her with his fists on November 24, 1986 outside of a courtroom; that he threatened her two days later at her place of employment; and that her two oldest children were afraid of the husband. The District Court, by temporary ex parte order, directed that the husband refrain from abusing the wife and other household members. At a subsequent hearing, at which the husband was represented by counsel, the District Court issued a final order that the husband refrain from abusing the wife, that temporary custody of the children residing within the family home be awarded to the wife, and that the husband not contact or visit the family for any reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">The husband appealed to the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, pursuant to \u00a7 12-401 of the Courts Article. That section, which governs appeals from final judgments entered in the District Court, provides in subsection (d):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-8\">\u201c(d) <em>De novo and on record </em>appeals.\u2014In a civil case in which the amount in controversy exceeds $1,000 exclusive of interest, costs, and attorney\u2019s fees if attorney\u2019s fees are recoverable by law or contract, and in any case in which the parties so agree, an appeal shall be heard on the record made in the District Court. In every other case, including a criminal case in which sentence has been imposed or suspended following a plea of nolo contendere or guilty, and an appeal in a municipal infraction or Code \u25a0 violation case, an appeal shall be tried de novo.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b741-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>The wife moved to dismiss the appeal. She claimed that the case involved an \u201camount in controversy\u201d in excess of $1,000 and consequently had to be tried on the record, rather than de novo. She urged that the husband\u2019s failure to provide the requisite transcript of District Court proceedings required that the appeal be dismissed. The court (Johnson, J.) agreed and dismissed the appeal. We subsequently granted the husband\u2019s petition for certiorari <em>(see </em>\u00a7 12-305 of the Courts Article) to determine whether an appeal under the Domestic Violence Act, as here, involves an \u201camount in controversy\u201d in excess of $1,000 which must be tried on the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">Petitions filed under the Domestic Violence Act are plainly civil cases, equitable in nature. In considering the \u201camount in controversy\u201d provisions of \u00a7 12-401(d) of the Courts Article, as applied to appeals from final District Court orders under the Act, we seek to ascertain and effectuate legislative intent, the primary source of which is found in the language of the statute. <em>In Re Ramont K., </em>305 Md. 482, 505 A.2d 507 (1986). This language must be given its natural and ordinary signification, bearing in mind the statutory purpose, aim and objectives. <em>Kaczorowski v. City of Baltimore, </em>309 Md. 505, 525 A.2d 628 (1987). That the Act was designed to aid victims of domestic abuse by providing an immediate and effective nonmonetary remedy is readily apparent. To this end the Legislature empowered courts to order that the abuse be stopped, that the abuser leave the family home, and that other specified protective devices be implemented, all to protect the victims\u2019 immediate and future safety. No provision is contained in the Act which permits a monetary award to any party in the proceeding, nor did the wife make any such claim in this case. The Legislature never intended in such circumstances that a monetary amount would be a determinative factor governing the mode of appeal from final District Court protective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>orders under the Act. Thus, the appeal to the circuit court in this case must be tried de novo under \u00a7 12-401(d) of the Courts Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">In so concluding, we have considered <em>Purvis v. Forrest Street Apts., </em>286 Md. 398, 408 A.2d 388 (1979), a summary ejectment action brought by a landlord in the District Court to regain possession of the premises and to collect past due rent totalling $487. As the applicable jurisdictional amount under \u00a7 12-401(d) at that time was $500, the circuit court, on appeal, determined that the jurisdictional amount was not satisfied and therefore ordered that the trial be de novo. In reversing that judgment, we concluded that the value of the right to possession in a month-to-month tenancy was equal to at least one month\u2019s rent and was properly added to the claim for unpaid rent, thereby exceeding the requisite jurisdictional amount for a record appeal. Our holding in <em>Purvis </em>was limited to a monetary value that was ascertainable; we said \u201cthat the value of the right to possession of the premises, <em>if it can be ascertained, </em>should be considered along with the plaintiff\u2019s initial monetary demand [for unpaid rent] in determining the nature of the appellate court\u2019s jurisdiction.\u201d 286 Md. at 403, 408 A.2d 388 (emphasis added). Unlike <em>Purvis, </em>the matters here involved, and protected under the Domestic Violence Act, i.e. to be free of spousal abuse, and to be awarded temporary custody of children, were not intended by the Legislature to be valued in monetary terms; hence, there is no monetary \u201camount in controversy\u201d under the circumstances of this case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b743-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>Nor does <em>Santosky v. Kramer, </em>455 U.S. 745, 102 S.Ct. 1388, 71 L.Ed.2d 599 (1982), upon which the wife also places reliance, support a different result. There, the Supreme Court referred to the fundamental liberty interest of a parent in a child as \u201cfar more precious than any property right.\u201d 455 U.S. at 758-59, 102 S.Ct. at 1397. From this, the wife reasons that a monetary value in excess of $1,000 must be placed on the protection of such familial relationships under the Act\u2019s provisions. We agree that familial relationships may be precious, but that does not make their value ascertainable in monetary terms within the contemplation of \u00a7 12-401(d) of the Courts Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">More in point, and consistent with the legislative intent in enacting the Domestic Violence Act, is <em>Carten v. Carten, </em>153 Conn. 603, 219 A.2d 711 (1966), involving an equity action to enforce discovery. Noting that no damages were claimed nor was any pecuniary value asserted, the court determined that the value of the right to disclosure of facts could not be given a monetary value. Thus, the court approved the proposition, citing authority, that when the jurisdiction of an inferior court is made by statute to depend on a specified amount, the jurisdiction does not attach to any case in which the right involved cannot be calculated in money. 219 A.2d at 715.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">As the husband was entitled to a de novo appeal in this case, the trial court was in error in dismissing the appeal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY DISMISSING THE APPEAL VACATED; CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS OPINION; COSTS TO BE PAID BY THE APPELLEE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b739-7\">. Maryland Code (1984), \u00a7 4-404 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article provides that the District Court has concurrent jurisdiction with the circuit court in proceedings under the Act \u201cand has the powers of a court in equity in those proceedings.\" In addition, \u00a7 4-501(c) of the Family Law Article defines the word \u201c \u2018Court\u2019 \u201d to mean \u201cthe District Court or a circuit court in this State.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b742-6\">. For other cases of interest, <em>see Carroll v. Housing Opportunities Comm\u2019n, </em>306 Md. 515, 510 A.2d 540 (1986) (in computing the $500 amount in controversy in a demand for a jury trial pursuant to Art. 23 of the Declaration of Rights and an implementing statute, the court must consider the value of the tenant\u2019s continued possession of the rental property); <em>Bringe v. Collins, </em>274 Md. 338, 335 A.2d 670 (1975) (court must consider both claim for money damages and claim of value of right to possession in leasehold estate in determining whether \"amount in controversy\u201d satisfied the State constitutional right to a jury trial).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b743-8\">. On remand, the circuit court must consider whether the provisions of the Domestic Violence Act were properly invoked. As earlier observed, it does not appear that the husband and wife resided together at the family home at the time of the alleged abuse, an apparent requisite under the Act before its provisions may become applicable.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
