While placing primary responsibility for the prevention and control of air pollution with the states, \u00a7 7401(a)(3), the Act empowered the Administrator of the Federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to establish national ambient air quality standards for various pollutants, and to promulgate rules and regulations for attaining those standards.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u00a7 7409. The Act authorized the EPA to divide the country into \u201cair quality control region[s].\u201d \u00a7 7407(c). It required each state to submit for EPA approval a \u201cstate implementation plan\u201d (SIP), setting forth the state\u2019s program for achieving the requisite air quality standards in each of its control regions by' 1975. \u00a7 7410.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">Amendments to the Clean Air Act in 1977 extended the submission date of a SIP to January 1, 1979, for states with \u201cnonattainment areas,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>regions that had failed to meet the air quality standards by 1975. \u00a7 7501(2). National air quality standards were to be attained \u201cas expeditiously as practicable,\u201d but no later than December 31, 1982. \u00a7 7502(a)(1). States unable by 1982 to achieve the national standards for two particular pollutants\u2014photochemical oxidants and carbon monoxide\u2014could request an extension until December 31, 1987. \u00a7 7502(a)(2). In exchange for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>this extension, however, a state\u2019s SIP had to \u201cestablish a specific schedule for implementation of a vehicle emission control inspection and maintenance program----\u201d \u00a7 7502(b)(ll)(B). Noncompliance could result in a loss of federal highway funds, \u00a7 7506(a), and of sewage treatment plant construction grants, \u00a7 7616.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">Two of Maryland\u2019s six air quality control regions were found by both the State and the EPA to be nonattainment areas for ozone and carbon monoxide standards. These two regions were the Metropolitan Baltimore Intrastate Air Quality Control Region, consisting of Baltimore City and Anne Arundel, Baltimore, Carroll, Harford, and Howard Counties, and the Maryland portion of the National Capital Interstate Air Quality Control Region, consisting of Prince George\u2019s and Montgomery Counties.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Because the requisite air quality standards for ozone and carbon monoxide could not be attained in these two regions by the 1982 deadline, the State, in January 1979, formally requested an extension of the EPA deadline.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">Maryland\u2019s VEIP, codified within the Transportation Article as Title 23, Subtitle 2, was enacted by ch. 421 of the Acts of 1979. As originally enacted, \u00a7 23-201 defined \u201cEmissions standard\u201d in terms of a limitation upon \u201cthe quantity, quality, rate, or concentration of emissions from a motor vehicle,\u201d including a requirement that \u201crelates to the operation or maintenance of a motor vehicle to assure continuous emission reduction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">Section 23-202(a) required that by October 1, 1979, the MVA publish \u201cproposed rules and regulations providing, to the extent required by federal law, for the establishment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>an emissions inspection program to commence no earlier than July 1, 1980 and no later than December 31, 1982.\u201d Prior to drafting the proposed rules, the MVA was required by this subsection to conduct two public hearings, one each in the Washington and Baltimore metropolitan areas, in order to receive public comment. The MVA was required by the statute to submit its proposed rules and regulations to each House of the General Assembly by a specified date in 1980; it was also required to conduct public education and awareness programs on a regular basis \u201cto inform the citizens concerning the benefits of the emissions program.\u201d The subsection specified that after December 31, 1983, the inspection program would be mandatory for all motor vehicles in the State \u201cnot otherwise exempted.\u201d It provided that unless legislation established a different program at the 1980 session of the General Assembly, \u201cthe proposed rules and regulations, with any amendments that shall have been concurred in by joint resolution of the General Assembly, shall take effect as provided in the rules and regulations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">Section 23-202(b) required that an inspection system be established in the State \u201cfor annual inspection, under a schedule adopted by the [MVA] Administrator, of those motor vehicles required to be inspected.\u201d It mandated the construction of inspection facilities in strategic locations \u201cthat will best serve the public convenience.\u201d Section 23-202(c). Section 23-203 directed that the MVA provide in its rules and regulations \u201cfor the establishment of inspection facilities.\u201d Section 23-204 required that the inspection determine \u201cwhether each vehicle complies with the emission standards established under this subtitle for that vehicle,\u201d and that the MVA set the fee for the inspection within specified limits. Section 23-205. Section 23-206 required owners of motor vehicles registered in Maryland to \u201chave the vehicle inspected, as required under this subtitle.\u201d Section 23-207 authorized the MVA to adopt rules and regulations \u201cas required for purposes of implementation, administration, regulation, and enforcement of the provisions of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>this subtitle, including rules and regulations that, consistent with federal law, exempt certain vehicles from the inspections under this subtitle.\u201d This section also directed the Secretary of Health and Mental Hygiene,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> with the concurrence of the Secretary of Transportation, to publish rules and regulations establishing \u201cemission standards to be used for the inspection of motor vehicles under this subtitle.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ARA\">The VEIP was amended by the General Assembly during its 1980, 1981, 1982, 1983, and 1985 sessions. <em>See, e.g., </em>ch. 725 of the Acts of 1980 (start of the mandatory VEIP extended to \u201c[ajfter December 31, 1982\u201d); ch. 492 of the Acts of 1982 (extended to \u201c[ajfter June 30, 1983\u201d); ch. xxxxxxx 312 of the Acts of 1983 (start-up postponed until after December 31, 1983). The amendments also increased the inspection fee, ch. 725 of the Acts of 1980; allowed the MVA to issue hardship waivers, ch. 517 of the Acts of 1983, and waivers for any vehicle that failed the emissions test if the owner had actually spent a specified amount for repairs to the vehicle, ch. 725 of the Acts of 1980; exempted ambulances from VEIP inspection, ch. 549 of the Acts of 1983; and instructed the Secretaries of the Environment and Transportation to jointly report to designated legislative committees as to any modifications to the Federal Clean Air Act. <em>See </em>ch. 492 of the Acts of 1982; ch. 19 of the Acts of 1985. The 1982 amendments also created a special joint committee on VEIP, comprised of three senators and three delegates to \u201cregularly consult\u201d with the Secretary of Transportation on the administration of the VEIP. In addition, ch. 106 of the Acts of 1985 (the Budget Bill) required an evaluation by the Departments of Transportation and Health and Mental Hygiene of the VEIP\u2019s effectiveness. During its 1986 session, the legislature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>passed Senate Joint Resolution 22 calling for the establishment of a VEIP Task Force to \u201creview options and make recommendations for the future of the Vehicle Emissions Inspection Program.\u201d The Task Force, which was composed, inter alia, of three delegates, three senators, and representatives from the Department of Transportation and the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, issued its findings and recommendations to the General Assembly and the Governor in January 1987.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">On January 11, 1984, the County Commissioners of Carroll County, in their individual and official capacities, the town of Mt. Airy, its mayor, and a resident of Carroll County (appellees) filed a petition for declaratory judgment and an interlocutory injunction in the Circuit Court for Carroll County. Named as defendants were the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, the Department of Transportation, and the MVA (the State). The appellees challenged the constitutionality of the VEIP\u2019s application to Carroll County, raising the issues of equal protection, substantive and procedural due process, illegal search and seizure, and unlawful taking of property. On January 31, 1984, the court (Gilmore, J.) entered an interlocutory order enjoining the enforcement of the VEIP in Carroll County.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">On appeal, we vacated the interlocutory injunction and remanded the case to the lower court for further proceedings. We held that: the VEIP\u2019s tailpipe tests did not constitute a search and seizure within the meaning of the fourth amendment; that the inclusion of Carroll County and the exclusion of other rural counties in the VEIP was not a violation of equal protection because Carroll County was part of a \u201cnonattainment area\u201d for ozone; that COMAR \u00a7 11.14.06.05 exempting certain classes of vehicles from the program did not violate equal protection because a rational basis existed for the exemptions; that the VEIP provided adequate procedures to safeguard procedural due process interests of vehicle owners; that the suspension or revoca<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>tion of vehicle registration under the program was not a taking in violation of either the State or the Federal Constitution; that Carroll County\u2019s inclusion in the VEIP was not a violation of substantive due process; and that the MVA had implicit authority to amend the regulations implementing the inspection program. <em>Department of Transportation v. Armacost, </em>299 Md. 392, 474 A.2d 191 (1984) <em>(Armacost I).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">Upon remand, the circuit court (Gilmore, J.), ruling on the parties\u2019 cross-motions for summary judgment, held that \u00a7 23-202 and \u00a7 23-207 of the Transportation Article constituted an unlawful delegation of power from the legislature to an administrative agency in violation of Article 8 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. Specifically, the court concluded that \u00a7 23-202 did no more than require the MVA to publish rules and regulations \u201cto the extent required by federal law\u201d and to establish an inspection system within Maryland. Further, the court stated that while \u00a7 23-207 requires that the rules and regulations adopted by the MVA be \u201cconsistent with federal law,\u201d the statute did not \u201cset forth sufficient guidelines for the MVA to determine what persons, vehicles, and geographic areas should be included in the program.\u201d The court said that the powers vested in the MVA to make rules and regulations did not permit it to make laws. Thus, the court said, \u201cin applying the program only to the Baltimore and Washington Metropolitan Regions, and not to the State as a whole, as provided for in \u00a7 23-202(b), the MVA restricted the Act being administered and, in doing so, legislated.\u201d It concluded that \u201cthe delegation of power by the Legislature was too broad and failed to provide adequate guidelines and thus ... was unconstitutional and the statutes and regulations in question are invalid.\u201d Judge Gilmore granted summary judgment for the appellees, and the State appealed to the Court of Special Appeals.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We granted certiorari prior to argument in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>intermediate appellate court to consider the important issue raised in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">Our cases have long sanctioned delegations of legislative power to administrative officials where sufficient safeguards are legislatively provided for the guidance of the agency in its administration of the statute. <em>See, e.g., Sullivan v. Bd. of License Comm\u2019rs, </em>293 Md. 113, 121, 442 A.2d 558 (1982); <em>Governor v. Exxon Corp., </em>279 Md. 410, 370 A.2d 1102 (1977), <em>aff'd, </em>437 U.S. 117, 98 S.Ct. 2207, 57 L.Ed.2d 91 (1978); <em>County Council v. Investors Funding, </em>270 Md. 403, 442, 312 A.2d 225 (1973). As these cases indicate, the statutory guidelines serve not only to reduce the possibility of an arbitrary exercise of administrative discretion but also assist a reviewing court in determining the validity of agency action. The trend of the cases, as we pointed out in <em>Investors Funding, supra, </em>270 Md. at 442, 312 A.2d 225 \u201cis toward greater liberality in permitting grants of discretion to administrative officials, particularly in the fields of public health and safety, in order to facilitate the administration of the laws as the complexity of governmental and economic conditions increase.\u201d Consistent with this view, we have upheld broad delegations of legislative power to administrative agencies in numerous case. <em>See, e.g., Sullivan, supra, </em>293 Md. at 123, 442 A.2d 558 (authorizing the adoption of rules and regulations by a liquor licensing board as may be necessary \u201cto effectively administer the law and to foster and promote temperance\u201d); <em>Governor v. Exxon Corp., supra, </em>279 Md. at 415, 370 A.2d 1102 (statute authorizing the Comptroller of the Treasury to adopt \u201c \u2018rules or regulations defining the circumstances in which a producer or refiner temporarily may operate a previously dealer-operated station,\u2019 \u201d and to permit \u201c \u2018reasonable exceptions to the divestiture dates,\u2019 \u201d by which producers or refiners of petroleum products are required to divest themselves of ownership of retail service stations in the State); <em>Montgomery County v. Walsh, </em>274 Md. 502, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>523, 336 A.2d 97 (1975) (statute authorizing the County Executive to adopt \u201c \u2018reasonable and necessary rules and regulations\u2019 \u201d for the implementation of the Montgomery County Financial Disclosure Ordinance which required the filing of such financial disclosure statements \u201c \u2018as might be desirable to promote the trust and confidence of the citizens of the County in the ... County government\u2019 \u201d); <em>Davis v. Montgomery County, </em>267 Md. 456, 464, 298 A.2d 178 (1972) (statute authorizing boards of trustees of community colleges to adopt \u201c \u2018reasonable rules, bylaws or regulations\u2019 \u201d to effectuate and carry out the provisions of the statute relating to the establishment and maintenance of community colleges); <em>McBriety v. Baltimore City, </em>219 Md. 223, 238, 148 A.2d 408, 418 (1959) (statute authorizing the building inspection engineer, the commissioner of health, and the chief of the fire department to adopt rules and regulations \u201cproper and necessary\u201d to enforce multiple-family dwelling ordinance for the protection of the public interest); <em>Givner v. Commissioner of Health, </em>207 Md. 184, 187-88, 113 A.2d 899 (1955) (statute authorizing commissioner of health to adopt rules and regulations \u201cproper and necessary\u201d for the enforcement of a health ordinance pertaining to bathing facilities in dwelling units).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">In concluding that broad delegations of legislative authority to administrative agencies is particularly appropriate in the areas of public health and safety, we explained in <em>Givner, supra, </em>207 Md. at 191, 113 A.2d 899:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-5\">\u201cIn the field of public health, still more flexible standards are permitted. The concept of public health is more definite than that of general welfare, and there is a practical necessity for expert interpretation in its application to concrete situations.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-6\"><em>See also Med. Discipline v. Stillman, </em>291 Md. 390, 414, 435 A.2d 747 (1981); <em>Petrushansky v. State, </em>182 Md. 164, 174, 32 A.2d 696 (1943); <em>Tighe v. Osborne, </em>150 Md. 452, 460-61, 133 A. 465 (1926). We have also relaxed the general rule that a statute vesting discretion in administrative officials <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>without fixing any standards for their guidance is an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AUk\">\u201cwhere the discretion to be exercised relates to police regulations for the protection of public morals, health, safety, or general welfare, and it is impracticable to fix standards without destroying the flexibility necessary to enable the administrative officials to carry out the legislative will, legislation delegating such discretion without such restrictions may be valid.\u201d <em>Pressman v. Barnes, </em>209 Md. 544, 555, 121 A.2d 816 (1956).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">In certain circumstances, the expert assistance afforded by administrative agencies is so important to public health that we have found implied limitations on agency discretion when none has been expressed in the statutory language. <em>See Truitt v. Board of Public Works, </em>243 Md. 375, 391, 221 A.2d 370 (1966). In this regard, \u201cit is manifestly impractical for the legislature to set specific guidelines to govern the day-to-day exercise of the rule-making power.\u201d <em>Sullivan, supra, </em>293 Md. at 122-23, 435 A.2d 747. Of course, agency rules and regulations must be reasonable and consistent with the letter and spirit of the law under which the agency acts. <em>Baltimore v. William E. Koons, Inc., </em>270 Md. 231, 310 A.2d 813 (1973); <em>Comptroller v. Rockhill, Inc., </em>205 Md. 226, 107 A.2d 93 (1954).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b193-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>The State maintains that the delegation of authority to the MVA and to the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene under the statutes, and particularly \u00a7\u00a7 23-202 and 23-207, contains sufficient specific directives to the agencies and is therefore valid and constitutional. It says that the MVA, under the VEIP legislation, is required to comply with clearly articulated legislative standards in the administration of the emissions inspection program. The State argues that both \u00a7\u00a7 23-202 and 23-207, in express terms, incorporate the detailed standards imposed by the Clean Air Act and its regulations and therefore contain constitutionally sufficient limitations upon the discretion vested in the administrative agencies in bringing the State\u2019s nonattainment areas into compliance with the national ambient air quality standards set by the EPA. According to the State, the \u201ctouchstone\u201d of the VEIP is the Federal Clean Air Act and its regulations; it is the federal law which furnishes the context for interpreting the VEIP legislation. The General Assembly, the State urges, made the fundamental policy decisions when it enacted the state law, leaving to the agencies the task of implementing those decisions. In particular, the State invites attention to the Preamble to ch. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>492 of the Acts of 1982 in which the General Assembly recited its purpose \u201cto pursue, in good faith, the attainment of the ambient air quality standards established by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">The State contends that the Legislature may, and did, embrace federal' standards in directing its administrative agencies to adopt rules and regulations in compliance with the federal requirements. As the federal law requires only that the VEIP be established in the State\u2019s two nonattainment regions, the State says that the MVA properly so limited the program\u2019s scope in accordance with the statutory policy prescribed by the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">In support of the circuit court\u2019s holding, the appellees argue that the VEIP does not incorporate the detailed standards imposed by the Clean Air Act, nor does it impose specific federal rules by adopting them as state law. They suggest that the sole legislative standard provided by the VEIP pertains to goals in the federal statute, which by its very terms requires that the choices be made only by the states. They claim that the federal law affords broad latitude to the states in determining the contents of their plan and specifically provides that the SIP specify the manner in which national primary and secondary ambient air quality standards will be achieved and maintained. The appellees argue that in enacting the VEIP legislation, the Legislature \u201cmade no policy decisions\u201d and gave \u201cno legislative directives, policies or standards to guide the MVA.\u201d As a consequence, it is argued that \u201call the key decisions involving the scope of the VEIP were made by the MVA\u201d in violation of the delegation doctrine and Article 8 of the Declaration of Rights. Those key decisions, according to appellees, included (1) the relationship between stationary and vehicular emissions; (2) the designation of the counties which would be part of the VEIP; (3) the permissible level of pollutants from each vehicle or class of vehicles; (4) the types of vehicles excluded from the program; and (5) how <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>long a vehicle has to be tested. As to these, the appellees suggest that the MYA was given complete freedom to design any program it wished to implement and thus the discretion vested in the agency was wholly unchanneled.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\">The appellees agree that the constitutional test, under the delegation doctrine, is whether the General Assembly provided sufficient legislative guidelines to limit adequately the exercise of discretion by administrative officials. The appellees suggest that the delegation doctrine \u201chas been infused with renewed vitality in recent years,\u201d and they rely in particular on a spate of late Supreme Court separation of powers cases in support of this view.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In light of these cases, they maintain that even if the MVA regulations contain provisions for the protection of public health, nevertheless the current governing law would not find it impracticable for the Legislature to establish standards without destroying the flexibility needed by administrative officials in administering a vehicle emissions program.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">The delegation doctrine, prohibiting a legislative body from delegating its law-making function to any other branch of government or entity is a corollary of the separation of powers doctrine which underlies both the Maryland and Federal Constitutions.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Steeped in the political theories of Montesquieu and Locke, those who framed the constitutions of our states and of the federal government believed that separating the functions of government and assigning the execution of those functions to different <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>branches was fundamental to good government and the preservation of civil liberties.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">Only twice in its history has the Supreme Court invalidated congressional grants of legislative authority to the Executive Branch.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Early cases found the Court willing to uphold delegations of power for fact-finding necessary for suspending or effectuating legislation. <em>See Cargo of the Brig Aurora v. United States, </em>11 U.S. (7 Cranch) 382, 3 L.Ed. 378 (1813); <em>Field v. Clark, </em>143 U.S. 649, 12 S.Ct. 495, 36 L.Ed. 294 (1892); <em>Wayman v. Southard, </em>23 U.S. (10 Wheat.) 1, 6 L.Ed. 253 (1825); <em>United States v. Grimaud, </em>220 U.S. 506, 31 S.Ct. 480, 55 L.Ed. 563 (1911). The Supreme Court first articulated a rule by which to judge the constitutionality of congressional delegations of power in <em>J.W. Hampton, Jr. &amp; Co. v. United States, </em>276 U.S. 394, 48 S.Ct. 348, 72 L.Ed. 624 (1928). That case concerned a delegation to the President of the power to set tariff rates that would equalize production costs in the United States and competing countries. The Court upheld the delegation, concluding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-5\">\u201cIf Congress shall lay down by legislative act an intelligible principle to which the person or body authorized to fix such rates is directed to conform, such legislative action is not a forbidden delegation of legislative power\u201d 276 U.S. at 409, 48 S.Ct. at 352.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">The Court thereafter upheld transfers to administrative agencies of legislative authority broader than those of previous delegations. <em>See, e.g., New York Central S.

Ryan, </em>293 U.S. 388, 55 S.Ct. 241, 79 L.Ed. 446 (1935) concerned \u00a7 9(c) of the National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA) of 1933 which authorized the President to prohibit interstate shipments of \u201chot oil,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>oil produced or withdrawn from storage contrary to state law. The Court determined that \u00a7 9(c) was unconstitutional because it provided no criteria to guide the President in deciding when to prohibit \u201chot oil\u201d transports. In <em>A.L.A. Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, </em>295 U.S. 495, 55 S.Ct. 837, 79 L.Ed. 1570 (1935), the Court examined central provisions of the NIRA that authorized the President to approve codes of \u201cfair competition\u201d upon application by trade or industrial associations. The Court invalidated the delegation, finding that the \u201cfair competition\u201d standard did not refer to a \u201ccategory established in law\u201d that could be used as a restriction on code-making; rather, it was a</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-5\">\u201c \u2018convenient designation for whatever set of laws the formulators of a code for a particular trade or industry may propose and the President may approve ... as being wise and beneficient provisions for the government of the trade or industry in order to accomplish the broad purpose ... stated in the first section of Title I.\u2019 \u201d 295 U.S. at 531, 55 S.Ct. at 843.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">Following <em>Schechter, </em>the Court refined the criteria used to determine the scope of a legislative delegation\u2019s constitutionality. <em>Yakus v. United States, </em>321 U.S. 414, 64 S.Ct. 660, 88 L.Ed. 834 (1944) sustained a wartime measure that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>gave an administrative agency extensive powers to fix commodity prices under a statutory standard of \u201cgenerally fair and equitable.\u201d The Court there stated, 321 U.S. at 426, 64 S.Ct. at 668, that legislative standards must enable a court, upon review, to ascertain whether an administrative agency had followed the legislative will.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-4\">\u201cOnly if we could say that there is an absence of standards for the guidance of the Administrator\u2019s action, so that it would be impossible in a proper proceeding to ascertain whether the will of Congress has been obeyed, would we be justified in overriding its choice of means for effecting its declared purpose of preventing inflation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ABi\">After <em>Yakus, </em>the Court continued to uphold broad standards for congressional delegations. <em>See, e.g., U.S. v. Southwestern Cable Co., </em>392 U.S. 157, 88 S.Ct. 1994, 20 L.Ed.2d 1001 (1968) (upholding FCC cable TV regulations promulgated under Communications Act of 1934 even though the Court acknowledged that Congress could not have foreseen the development of cable TV when it passed the Act); <em>Arizona v. California, </em>373 U.S. 546, 83 S.Ct. 1468, 10 L.Ed.2d 542 (1963) (giving broad discretion to Secretary of Interior to apportion Colorado River water rights); <em>Lichter v. United States, </em>334 U.S. 742, 68 S.Ct. 1294, 92 L.Ed. 1694 (1948) (upholding statutory standard of \u201cexcessive profits\u201d); <em>Federal Power Com\u2019n v. Hope Natural Gas Co., </em>320 U.S. 591, 64 S.Ct. 281, 88 L.Ed. 333 (1944) (upholding statutory standard of \u201cjust and reasonable\u201d). The delegation doctrine thus returned to its <em>pre-Schechter </em>dormancy to the extent that some commentators have considered it a \u201cdead letter\u201d of constitutional law.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b199-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>The Supreme Court cases upon which appellees place reliance, and from which they claim a revitalization of the delegation doctrine, <em>see </em>n. 13, <em>supra, </em>although perhaps signaling a stricter application of the separation of powers doctrine, were not decided on principles governing delegation of legislative authority to administrative agencies. <em>Buckley v. Valeo, </em>424 U.S. 1, 96 S.Ct. 612, 46 L.Ed.2d 659 held unconstitutional a provision of the Federal Election Campaign Act because it violated the Appointments Clause of the Constitution, an Article II power. <em>Northern Pipeline Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co., supra, </em>invalidated the Bankruptcy Act\u2019s grant of Article III\u2014like jurisdiction to the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s nonarticle III judges. <em>INS v. Chadha, supra, </em>held unconstitutional the legislative veto provision of the Immigration Act. <em>Bowsher v. Synar, supra, </em>invalidated the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act because it authorized the Comptroller General, a legislative officer, to execute the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\">Our own cases have never interpreted the separation of powers doctrine embedded in Article 8 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights as imposing a complete separation between the branches of government. <em>See Baltimore v. State, </em>15 Md. 376 (1860). In that early case, the Court acknowledged that \u201cthe words of the Article ... have not been accepted in their literal sense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 459. More recently, in <em>Dep\u2019t of Nat. Res. v. Linchester, </em>274 Md. 211, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>334 A.2d 514 (1975), we noted that there has been an extensive introduction of administrative agencies in State government, as a result of which \u201cthere has occurred within these agencies some mingling, blending and overlapping of the legislative, executive and judicial functions.\u201d 274 Md. at 220, 334 A.2d 514. Moreover, we said, \u201cThis [is] permissible, within limits, as the separation of powers concept may constitutionally encompass a sensible degree of elasticity and should not be applied with doctrinaire rigor.\u201d <em>Id. See also </em>R. Oppenheimer, <em>Administrative Law in Maryland, 2 </em>Md.L.Rev. 185, 188 (1938). In view of our case law on the delegation doctrine, we find no substance in appellees\u2019 argument that Article 8 of the Declaration of Rights requires a much stricter application of the separation of powers doctrine than is applied in cases arising under the federal constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">We hold that the lower court was in error in invalidating the VEIP legislation involved in this case. That the delegation of authority to the MVA and the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene was legislatively directed and channeled to effectuate compliance with the Federal Clean Air Act in the development and implementation of a motor vehicle emissions inspection program is clear beyond question. Sections 23-202 and 23-207 are tied to the federal statute and quite plainly incorporate the federal goal of attainment of the requisite air quality standards. Section 23-202 requires a VEIP \u201cto the extent required by federal law.\u201d Section 23-207 requires the adoption of agency rules and regulations consistent with federal law for the purpose of \u201cimplementation, administration, regulation and enforcement\u201d of the VEIP statute, including rules establishing vehicle emission standards and exempting certain vehicles from inspection.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">Manifestly, the Legislature made the fundamental policy decision to conform state with federal law and thus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>maintain the State\u2019s eligibility for federal highway and sewage treatment plant grants. <em>Armacost I, supra, </em>299 Md. at 402, 474 A.2d 191. Also clear from that case is that the VEIP is a measure designed to protect the public health and the widest latitude must be given in such circumstances to delegations of legislative authority to administrative agencies. 299 Md. at 400, 474 A.2d 191. That the VEIP legislation did not specify what persons, vehicles and geographic areas would be included within the program does not, considering all the circumstances, compel a finding that the delegation of legislative authority was too broad to withstand constitutional attack. Under the Federal Clean Air Act, the EPA Administrator was required to promptly disseminate to appropriate state agencies information \u201cregarding processes, procedures and methods to reduce or control [air pollutants]\u201d involved in the motor vehicle emission inspection and maintenance programs. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7408(f)(l)(A)(i). Ample guidance in extraordinary detail was provided under the federal law to the states in establishing their vehicle emission inspection programs.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Neither the MVA nor the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene was left without guidance in establishing and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>administering the inspection program required by the federal law.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">The Legislature made clear in its enactment of the VEIP that it would review agency rules and regulations and, in effect, sanction their implementation unless legislatively changed\u2014an implicit approval of the substance of the agency\u2019s rules and regulations governing the VEIP. Undoubtedly, as expressed in the Preamble to ch. 492 of the Acts of 1982, the breadth of the legislative delegation under the VEIP was to some extent influenced by the Legislature\u2019s concern that the federal law provisions would likely be modified on a continuing basis; that it would be impracticable for the General Assembly to act with immediacy in conforming its VEIP legislation to new federal standards; that because federal grant money hinged on compliance with the federal law, the Legislature did not intend to risk loss of these funds by waiting until legislation could be enacted at the next legislative session; and hence substantial reason existed for such delegation of authority to the administrative agencies to maintain a VEIP \u201cto the extent required by federal law.\u201d That there were numerous changes made by the Legislature in laws enacted subsequent to the original 1978 enactment also evidences the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>close and continuous legislative monitoring of its VEIP legislation and of agency action.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">Applicable to this case is our statement in <em>Governor v. Exxon Corp., supra, </em>279 Md. at 440, 370 A.2d 1102, that \u201cthe complexity of modern economic conditions may make it impossible to tailor specific guidelines for every conceivable situation ... [;] latitude in granting discretion [to administrative agencies] is necessary.\u201d <em>See generally South Terminal Corporation v. EPA, </em>504 F.2d 646 (1st Cir.1974). In so concluding, we note that it is entirely consistent with both federal and state law that the VEIP legislation, as administratively implemented, applied only to the two non-attainment regions of the State, one of which encompassed Carroll County.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">JUDGMENT REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR CARROLL COUNTY FOR ENTRY OF A DECLARATORY JUDGMENT CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLEES.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b183-11\">.
