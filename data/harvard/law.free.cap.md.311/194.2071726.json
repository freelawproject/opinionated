Unsuccessful there, as well as before the Montgomery County Merit System Protection Board to which he then appealed, McNeece noted a further appeal to the Circuit Court for Montgomery County. There, over the strong objection of Montgomery County, Maryland, he was successful, and Judge Stanley Frosh entered an order reversing the administrative action and directing that the Commission award McNeece an increase in salary.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">Within thirty days of the entry of that order, Montgomery County filed a Notice for In Banc Review. McNeece promptly countered with a motion to dismiss. The court in banc granted the motion, finding that Montgomery County had \u201cfailed to reserve its points or questions for consideration by the court in banc in accordance with \u00a7 22 of Art. IV of the Maryland Constitution.\u201d Montgomery County filed an order for appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, and that court dismissed the appeal, citing Maryland Rule 1035(b)(1) and <em>Medical Examiners v. Steward, </em>207 Md. 108, 113 A.2d 426 (1955). We granted Montgomery County\u2019s petition for certiorari to consider the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ABs\">Did the Court of Special Appeals err in dismissing the appeal as one not allowed by law?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-5\">Did the Circuit Court err in dismissing a request for an in banc appeal and in holding that compliance with Maryland Rule 2-551 did not satisfy the State constitutional requirements of Maryland Constitution, Art. IV, \u00a7 22?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A_T\">Additionally, we directed the parties to brief and argue the question of this Court\u2019s authority to issue a writ of certiorari to review the action of the Court of Special Appeals under the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">We first address the question of our jurisdiction to issue a writ of certiorari in this case. Article IV, \u00a7 14 of the Constitution of Maryland provides that \u201c[t]he jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals shall be co-extensive with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>limits of the State and such as now is or may hereafter be prescribed by law.\u201d Section 12-201 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (Md.Code 1974, 1984 Repl.Vol.) states that, except in certain instances not here relevant,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqe\">in any case or proceeding pending in or decided by the Court of Special Appeals upon appeal from a circuit court ... any party, including the State, may file in the Court of Appeals a petition for certiorari to review the case or proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-4\">This appeal involves a case decided by the Court of Special Appeals upon appeal from a circuit court. It differs from the typical case only in that it has also been considered by a separate appellate tribunal\u2014an in banc court. That difference is insufficient to remove this case from the broad coverage of \u00a7 12-201 of the Courts Article, and thus we hold that this Court has statutory jurisdiction to issue a writ of certiorari to the Court of Special Appeals in a case involving an in banc appeal. Whether this Court has, or whether the lower appellate tribunals involved in this case had, jurisdiction to consider the underlying issues are separate questions that we address in the following sections. We here decide only that we have jurisdiction to issue a writ of certiorari to enable us to consider those questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">Turning to the question of whether the Court of Special Appeals properly dismissed Montgomery County\u2019s appeal from the action of the in banc court, we hold that it did. The Constitution specifically provides that the decision of the in banc court is final as to the party appealing to that court, but not as to the non-moving party.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-7\">[T]he decision of the said Court in banc shall be the effective decision in the premises, and conclusive, as against the party, at whose motion said points, or questions were reserved; but such decision in banc shall not preclude the right of Appeal, or writ of error to the adverse party, in those cases, civil or criminal, in which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>appeal, or writ of error to the Court of Appeals may be allowed by Law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-4\">Constitution of Maryland, Article IV \u00a7 22.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">The Legislature has also acted to implement the constitutional mandate of finality. Section 12-302 of the Courts Article sets forth specific exceptions to the general right of appeal granted by \u00a7 12-301, and in subsection (d) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Apt\">Section 12-301 does not permit an appeal from the decision of the judges of a circuit court sitting in banc pursuant to Article IV, \u00a7 22 of the Constitution, if the party seeking to appeal is the party who moved to have the point or question reserved for consideration of the court in banc.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">This Court has consistently held that the decision of the court in banc is conclusive, final, and non-appealable by the party who sought the in banc review, and as to that party a reservation of points or questions for consideration by a court in banc is a substitute for an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. <em>Buck v. Folkers, </em>269 Md. 185, 186-87, 304 A.2d 826 (1973); <em>Medical Examiners v. Steward, </em>207 Md. 108, 111-12, 113 A.2d 426 (1955); <em>Costigin v. Bond, </em>65 Md. 122, 3 A. 285 (1886).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">Against this array of constitutional, statutory, and decisional law, Montgomery County presents a two-pronged attack. First, it urges that the in banc court\u2019s determination of the existence <em>vel non </em>of its own jurisdiction is always reviewable on appeal; and second, that the decision of the in banc court is final and conclusive only as to those issues actually reserved and presented by the moving party, and not, therefore, as to a question of jurisdiction raised by the adverse party, or by the in banc court on its own motion. Under the facts of this case, neither contention has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">It is true that even in the absence of a statute conferring the right to appeal, an appellate court may entertain an appeal to review a contention that an inferior appellate or trial court acted in excess of its jurisdiction. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number><em>Pr. Geo\u2019s Co. v. American Federation, </em>289 Md. 388, 398, 424 A.2d 770 (1981); <em>Urbana Civic v. Urbana Mobile, </em>260 Md. 458, 272 A.2d 628 (1971); <em>Bd. of Med. Examiners v. Steward, </em>203 Md. 574, 580, 102 A.2d 248 (1954); <em>Darrell v. Biscoe, </em>94 Md. 684, 687, 51 A. 410 (1902); <em>Webster v. Cockey, </em>9 Gill 92, 98 (1850).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-4\">It is a well settled rule that the Court of Appeals cannot entertain an appeal from any order or judgment of the Circuit Court sitting as an appellate tribunal under special statutory authority where no right of appeal is expressly given, except in cases where the Court exceeded its jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-5\"><em>Bd. of Med. Examiners v. Steward, supra, </em>203 Md. at 580, 102 A.2d 248.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">The rule is different, however, where the inferior appellate tribunal, possessed of authority to determine its own jurisdiction, determines that it is without jurisdiction in the case before it. Given the statutory prohibition against further appeal, that decision is final and unappealable. Paraphrasing the language of this Court in <em>Johnson v. Board of Zoning Appeals, </em>196 Md. 400, 412, 76 A.2d 736 (1950), if there is no right of appeal from the in banc court to the Court of Special Appeals, and if the in banc court had the power to decide what it did decide, then its decision, whether right or wrong in point of law or fact, cannot be reviewed. In <em>Bd. of Med. Examiners v. Steward, supra, </em>this Court held that a court in banc has the right to decide that it is without jurisdiction in a particular case, and that a decision to that effect is final and unappealable. More recently, in <em>Washabaugh v. Washabaugh, </em>285 Md. 393, 404 A.2d 1027 (1979), this Court re-affirmed the holding of <em>Bd. of Med. Examiners v. Steward, </em>and distinguished the case of an in banc court \u201cattempt[ing] to commit suicide\u201d by determining that the United States Constitution prohibited its existence. In light of the foregoing discussion, the County\u2019s first contention that the in banc court\u2019s determination of the existence of its own jurisdiction is always reviewable on appeal must fall.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>Montgomery County also argues that it had a right to appeal the decision of the in banc court because the rule of finality is limited to questions presented to the in banc court by the moving party. Because it did not reserve or present any question concerning the jurisdiction of that court, the County contends it is not foreclosed from appealing that decision. The County relies in part upon <em>State Roads Comm. v. Smith, </em>224 Md. 537, 168 A.2d 705 (1961). That reliance is misplaced, however, because <em>Smith </em>held only that within the time permitted for appeal and before a decision by the in banc court, a party may abandon an earlier notice of in banc appeal and perfect a direct appeal. We there said that it is the decision of the court in banc that is given conclusive effect by \u00a7 22, and not the mere initiation of the proceeding. <em>Id. </em>at 544, 168 A.2d 705. The County also cites <em>Merritts v. Merritts, </em>299 Md. 521, 474 A.2d 894 (1984), for the proposition that a moving party in an in banc appeal may later appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. That statement is correct only in the particular context of <em>Merritts, </em>and not as a general rule. <em>Merritts </em>involved successive appeals in the same case, the second of which involved subsequent issues which were not and could not have been considered in the first appeal. Under those circumstances, we held that the first appeal to an in banc court did not bar the wholly separate and subsequent appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. In the case before us, the issue of jurisdiction was decided by the in banc court, and the special circumstances of <em>Merritts </em>are simply not relevant. We hold that the determination by the in banc court that it was without jurisdiction to entertain the appeal was final and unappealable, and that the Court of Special Appeals correctly dismissed Montgomery County\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">Although we ordinarily do not express our views on any question raised by a dismissed appeal, we occasionally do so to resolve a matter of substantial importance. <em>Bd. of Med. Examiners v. Steward, supra, </em>203 Md. at 581, 102 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>A.2d 248; <em>Roth v. House of Refuge, </em>31 Md. 329, 334 (1869). The in banc court declared a portion of Md.Rule 2-551 unconstitutional, and we consider it in the public interest to address the correctness of that ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">For a period of ninety-one years following the adoption of the Constitution of 1776, the sole method of review of the decisions of the trial courts of general jurisdiction was by appeal to the Court of Appeals. Then, by the adoption of \u00a7 22 of Art. IV of the Constitution of 1867, an alternative method of appeal was provided\u2014appeal to three judges of a circuit sitting in banc.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Pursuant to that section, which exists today without substantial change, the in banc court is established as a separate appellate tribunal, and not merely as an arm of the trial court for purposes of reconsideration. <em>Estep v. Estep, </em>285 Md. 416, 421, 404 A.2d 1040 (1979); <em>Buck v. Folkers, supra, </em>269 Md. at 187-88, 304 A.2d 826.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">The apparent purpose of the constitutional provision was to offer disappointed litigants an alternative method of review that was faster and less expensive than an appeal to the Court of Appeals, and that avoided the necessity of traveling to Annapolis. The concept of having an appeal determined by circuit judges was hardly foreign to the lawyers and litigants of that day\u2014the Court of Appeals was comprised of the chief judge of each of the first seven Judicial Circuits and one specially elected judge from the City of Baltimore.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">The provision of \u00a7 22 that was consistent with the practice and procedure of 1867, but that was later to cause confusion, was the requirement that a party desiring in banc review of a point or question enter on the record an essentially contemporaneous exception. Section 22 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-7\">Where any Term is held, or trial conducted by less than the whole number of said Circuit Judges, upon the decision or determination of any point, or question, by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>Court, it shall be competent to the party, against whom the ruling or decision is made, upon motion, to have the point, or question reserved for the consideration of the three Judges of the Circuit, who shall constitute a court in banc for such purpose; and the motion for such reservation shall be entered of record, during the sitting, at which such decision may be made....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">The requirement of noting a contemporaneous exception in order to preserve a question for later appellate review was firmly ingrained in the common law. <em>See McCormick on Evidence </em>\u00a7 52, at 118-19 (E. Cleary 2d ed. 1972). The reason for the rule of contemporaneous exception, and its interaction with the additional requirement that a Bill of Exceptions be prepared and signed, were set forth by Professor Milton D. Green in <em>Basic Civil Procedure, </em>254-55 (2d ed. 1979):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-5\">The purpose of a Bill of Exceptions was to bring before the appellate court for review matters which otherwise would not appear on the common law record due to the fact that there were no court reporters to record the testimony and the proceedings at the trial. This was before the days of shorthand and recording devices. After the Statute of Westminster II if a litigant believed the court had erred in a ruling, he could make it a matter of record by \u201csaving his exception.\u201d For example, if counsel had objected to a question asked of a witness and the court had overruled the objection and counsel thought the ruling was erroneous, he could say, \u201cIf the court please, I desire to save an exception to your honor\u2019s ruling.\u201d The judge was then obliged to stop the trial and call the scrivener who, with his quill pen, would make a record on parchment____ When this document was completed, it would be signed by the judge. During the course of the trial numerous exceptions might be \u201csaved.\u201d At the conclusion of the trial they would be bound together and certified by the trial judge as the Bill of Exceptions in the case, and they would be attached to and become a part of the record on appeal. Today, with modern methods of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>court reporting, this antiquated method of preserving a record has become obsolete and court rules make \u201cexceptions\u201d unnecessary, (footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">The procedure in Maryland in 1867 generally followed the common law.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In <em>Thomas v. Ford, </em>63 Md. 346, 348, 52 Am Rep 513 (1885), our predecessors said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-5\">[I]n the absence of any ... special rule upon the subject, the general rule of practice is that the exception must be taken and noted at the time of the ruling made; but the reduction of the exception to form may and should be deferred to some more convenient time after the trial, but during the same term of court, when the exception should be presented for the signature and seal of the judge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Atc\"><em>See also Blake v. Pitcher, </em>46 Md. 453, 462-63 (1877); <em>Hagan v. Hendry, </em>18 Md. 177, 187-88 (1862); <em>Roloson v. Carson, </em>8 Md. 208, 225-26 (1855); 2 J. Poe, <em>Pleading and Practice at Law, </em>Pr. \u00a7 310 (4th ed. 1906). It is therefore logical and understandable that the draftsmen of \u00a7 22 included a requirement for contemporaneous exceptions as a part of an in banc appeal. The principal reason for the requirement, the absence of a stenographic record of the proceedings, was equally operative whether the appeal was to the Court of Appeals or to the in banc court. The Legislature moved promptly to regulate the procedures for in banc appeals, and by Chapter 441 of the Acts of 1868 provided, among other things, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-6\">Points or questions reserved for the court in <em>banc </em>shall be taken by means of exceptions, to be reduced to writing, and signed and sealed<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> by the Judges or Judge before whom the cause may be tried, and so framed that the point or question may be fully presented as to both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>law and fact in case the cause shall be transmitted to the Court of Appeals instead of being heard by the court in <em>banc.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">Originally codified within Article 75 of the Code, this provision was incorporated into the Maryland Rules of Procedure in 1957, as a part of Rule 510.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">With the advent of court stenographers and required verbatim accounts of trial proceedings, the need for contemporaneous exceptions ceased to exist. By the adoption in 1945 of Court of Appeals Rule 17, the \u201cunnecessary and outmoded formalit[y]\u201d of noting exceptions to rulings or orders of the court was ended. <em>Elmer v. State, </em>239 Md. 1, 6-9, 209 A.2d 776 (1965). Rule 17 provided that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-6\">Formal exceptions to the rulings or orders of the court are unnecessary; but for all purposes for which an exception has heretofore been necessary it is sufficient that a party at the time the ruling or order of the court is made or sought, makes known to the court the action which he desires the court to take or his objection to the action of the court and his grounds therefor; and, if a party has no opportunity to object to a ruling or order at the time it is made, the absence of an objection does not thereafter prejudice him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">The language of Court of Appeals Rule 17 was later incorporated into Md.Rule 522, and in 1984 became part of Rule 2-517.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">The modernization of appellate procedures accomplished by Court of Appeals Rule 17 and successor rules, while fully effective for purposes of ordinary appeals, had no effect on the procedure to be followed in appeals to in banc courts. Prior to 1984, Rule 510 remained in effect, specifically requiring the reservation of issues by means of exceptions. As a result, an outmoded procedure remained to unnecessarily complicate in banc appeals. Aggravating the situation was the fact that attorneys coming to the bar after 1945 were unfamiliar with the practice of noting formal exceptions to rulings or orders\u2014a practice that had been second-nature to their predecessors. Because of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>requirement that an exception be noted of record on the day the point or question was decided, in banc appeals were essentially unavailable in those cases in which a judge filed an order with the clerk and notified the parties by mail. Moreover, there was uncertainty concerning the time within which an oral exception had to be reduced to writing and signed by the trial judge. See <em>Faber v. Wolfe, </em>41 Md.App. 458, 397 A.2d 270 (1979), holding that an oral exception must be reduced to writing within a \u201creasonable time.\u201d <em>Compare Thomas v. Ford, supra, </em>63 Md. at 348.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">Aware of these problems and taking cognizance of the footnote penned by this Court in <em>Washabaugh, supra, </em>285 Md. at 399, n. 6, 404 A.2d 1027<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the Rules Committee of this Court recommended substantial revision of Rule 510 so that the procedure for taking an in banc appeal would parallel, to the extent possible, the procedure in taking an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. Rule 2-551, effective July 1, 1984, provided, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-5\">When review by a court in banc is permitted by the Maryland Constitution, a party may have a judgment or determination of any point or question reviewed by a court in banc by filing a notice for in banc review within the time prescribed by Rule 1012 for a filing of an appeal.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Issues are reserved for in banc review by making an objection in the manner set forth in Rules 2-517 and 2-520.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">McNeece does not contest the need for, or the salutary effect of, the changes accomplished by the adoption of Rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>2-551. His contention is that this Court lacked the authority to make those changes. Specifically, he argues that because the procedure for reservation of points by exception was established by the Constitution, that procedure can be changed only by an amendment of the Constitution. We see it differently. Section 22 contains its own constitutional authority for procedural changes. After detailing the procedure for reservation of points that we have previously discussed, \u00a7 22 provides by its final clause that \u201cthis Section shall be subject to such provisions as may hereafter be made by Law.\u201d Section 18 of Article IV of the Maryland Constitution grants to this Court the authority to \u201cadopt rules and regulations concerning the practice and procedure in and the administration of the appellate courts and in the other courts of this State,\u201d and provides that rules so adopted \u201cshall have the force of law.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AeM\">The changes made by the adoption of Rule 2-551 are within the constitutional authority granted by \u00a7\u00a7 22 and 18 of Article IV. The substantive right of appeal to an in banc court is in no way changed. Only the practice and procedure relating to the preservation of points for appellate review, and the time for filing an election to have the review before an in banc court, have been changed,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>these are matters within the rule-making authority of this Court. Reasonable regulation of the exercise of a constitutional right is permissible, provided the basic right is not impaired. <em>Md. Community Dev. Inc. v. S.R.C., </em>261 Md. 205, 210-14, 274 A.2d 641 (1971); <em>Houston v. Lloyd\u2019s, </em>241 Md. 10, 14-24, 215 A.2d 192 (1965); <em>Knee v. City Pass Ry. Co., </em>87 Md. 623, 625-33, 40 A. 890 (1898), <em>Thompson v. Giordano, </em>16 Md.App. 264, 271, 295 A.2d 881 (1972). The procedures established by Rule 2-551 do not impair the right to an in banc appeal and the rule is constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">Although the in banc court erred in holding that it was without jurisdiction to entertain the appeal, its decision on that point was final and unappealable, and the Court of Special Appeals correctly dismissed Montgomery County\u2019s attempt to appeal the determination of the in banc court.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED. COSTS TO BE PAID BY MONTGOMERY COUNTY, MARYLAND.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b319-8\">.

Relief from certain of the more stringent common law requirements for Bills of Exceptions was provided in 1869 when this Court adopted rules relating to appeals. <em>See Blake v.

Rule 2-551 was further amended in 1986, reducing the time for filing a motion for in banc review to ten days after the entry of judgment, or if certain post-judgment motions were filed, to ten days after disposition of those motions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b324-4\">. Subsection (a) of \u00a7 18 reads in its entirety:</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">The Court of Appeals from time to time shall adopt rules and regulations concerning the practice and procedure in and the administration of the appellate courts and in the other courts of this State, which shall have the force of law until rescinded, changed or modified by the Court of Appeals or otherwise by law.

Rule 2-551 made other changes that are not involved in this appeal, and which involve procedures for the presentation of the appeal to the in banc court. Although \u00a7 22 provides that \u201cthe several Circuit Courts shall regulate, by rules, the mode and manner of presenting such points, or questions to the Court in banc,\u201d \u00a7 18 provides that \"[t]he power of courts other than the Court of Appeals to make rules of practice and procedure, or administrative rules, shall be subject to the rules and regulations adopted by the Court of Appeals or otherwise by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>law.\u201d By the adoption of Rule 1-102 this Court has prohibited the adoption of circuit or local rules except as to specific matters not here involved.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b325-7\">ELDRIDGE, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"ANV\">concurring:</p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">The Constitution of Maryland, in Art. IV, \u00a7 22, provides that, when a party to a circuit court case desires to have a \u201cdecision or determination of any point\u201d reserved for consideration of a court in banc, \u201cthe motion for such reservation <em>shall </em>be entered of record, during the <em>sitting, </em>at which such decision may be made____\u201d (Emphasis added).* <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>Court in <em>Costigin v. Bond, </em>65 Md. 122, 3 A. 285 (1886), held that the term \u201csitting\u201d meant the day the decision was made, and that \u201cthis provision of the Constitution intended to give the party taking an exception ... the whole time until the Court adjourned for the day ... to determine whether he would have his appeal to the Court <em>in banc, </em>or to the Court of Appeals.\u201d 65 Md. at 124, 3 A. 285.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">The Court today does not take the position that the <em>Costigin v. Bond </em>holding was erroneous, or that the Court in <em>Costigin </em>mis-construed the constitutional intent. Rather, the majority today says that the final clause of Art. IV, \u00a7 22, stating that \u201cthis Section shall be. subject to such provisions as may hereafter be made by law,\u201d authorizes this Court through its rule making power<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to make \u201cchanges\u201d in the constitutional requirements of \u00a7 22. The majority frankly acknowledges that \u201cthe practice and procedure relating to the preservation of points for appellate review, and the time for filing an election to have the review before an in banc court, have been changed\u201d by Rule 2-551, and it says that these changes in the constitutional requirements are permissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>As far as I am aware, this is the first time in the history of American constitutional jurisprudence that any appellate court has taken the position that an authorization for legislative implementation of a constitutional provision includes an authorization to contradict or amend the mandatory requirements of the constitutional provision itself. I flatly disagree with the majority\u2019s view that the judges of this Court have been empowered to amend the Maryland Constitution. While, for the reasons set forth below, I also do not agree with the practice of commenting on a constitutional issue in a case where we lack authority to decide that issue, it is perhaps fortunate that the majority\u2019s unprecedented constitutional theory is set forth as dicta. As such, it is not precedent within the principle of stare decisis.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">Preliminarily, I disagree with the Court\u2019s expressing any view on the constitutionality of Rule 2-551. Because Montgomery County originally sought in banc review, Article IV, \u00a7 22, bars the County\u2019s further appeal. Acknowledging this, the Court decides only that the Court of Special Appeals correctly dismissed the appeal. I fully concur with this decision. Since the Court lacked jurisdiction to reach the merits, its discussion should have ended there.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">Nevertheless, the Court proceeds to the merits in this case, stating: \u201cAlthough we ordinarily do not express our views on any question raised by a dismissed appeal, we occasionally do so to resolve a matter of substantial importance.\u201d In dispensing its views on Rule 2-551, however, the majority ignores the prudential limitations on the doctrine it invokes. Our cases have repeatedly admonished that only in \u201crare instances\u201d and under \u201cthe most compel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>ling of circumstances\u201d will the Court express its views on the merits of a dismissed appeal. <em>See, e.g., In re Criminal Investigation No. 1-162, </em>307 Md. 674, 680-681, 516 A.2d 976 (1986); <em>Mercy Hosp. v. Jackson, </em>306 Md. 556, 562, 510 A.2d 562 (1986); <em>Reyes v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>281 Md. 279, 297, 380 A.2d 12 (1977). As pointed out in the often quoted language of Judge Hammond in <em>Lloyd v. Supervisors of Elections, </em>206 Md. 36, 43, 111 A.2d 379 (1954), \u201conly where the urgency of establishing a rule of future conduct in matters of important public concern is imperative and manifest, will there be justified a departure from the general rule and practice of not deciding academic questions____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">In recent years, those rare instances where the Court has expressed its views on the merits of dismissed appeals have involved either moot cases<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> or premature appeals, and not a situation where appellate jurisdiction over the case was entirely absent. In the latter situation, we have been particularly reluctant to express our views on the merits. With regard to the identical issue on which the majority now speaks, namely the constitutionality of Rule 2-551, we recently commented in a case where appellate jurisdiction was lacking: \u201cThe constitutional question decided by the circuit court, and debated by the parties before this Court, is obviously important for future cases where circuit court in banc review may be sought. Nevertheless, we shall not be able to reach that question in this case.\u201d <em>Walbert v. Walbert, </em>310 Md. 657, 661, 531 A.2d 291 (1987). Most appropriate is Judge Smith\u2019s statement for the Court in <em>Lewis v. Lewis, </em>290 Md. 175, 179, 428 A.2d 454 (1981): \u201cWe may not decide the issue presented if we have no jurisdiction to decide it, notwithstanding the importance of the issue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b329-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>As the majority explains, it is the Constitution itself, in Art. IV, \u00a7 22, which prohibits the exercise of jurisdiction by the Court of Special Appeals or this Court over the decision of the court in banc. For this Court to render an opinion on the holding of the court in banc, at least absent the greatest urgency, is in derogation of the constitutional limitation upon our jurisdiction. <em>Cfi, Reyes v. Prince George\u2019s County, supra, </em>281 Md. at 291-298, 380 A.2d 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\">In addition, the majority\u2019s statements concerning the constitutionality of Rule 2-551 ignore this Court\u2019s established policy of reaching constitutional issues only when necessary. <em>Allgood v. State, </em>309 Md. 58, 82, 522 A.2d 917 (1987); <em>Mercy Hosp. v. Jackson, supra, </em>306 Md. at 565, 510 A.2d 562, and cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">It is questionable whether any degree of urgency and importance justifies this Court\u2019s expressing its view on a constitutional issue where there is no appellate jurisdiction under the Constitution.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Assuming, however, that such expression may be justified under sufficiently urgent circumstances, the instant case does not fall within that category.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">This is not a case like <em>Board of Medical Examiners v. Steward, </em>203 Md. 574, 102 A.2d 248, 251 (1954), or <em>Roth v. House of Refuge, </em>31 Md. 329 (1869), cited by the majority. Those are the two cases in which this Court, although without appellate jurisdiction to do so,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> did express its view on the merits of constitutional issues. Both <em>Roth </em>and <em>Steward, </em>however, involved a lack of statutory appellate jurisdiction in this court over the type of case involved regardless of which party prevailed below. Thus the likeli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>hood that the court would be able to reach the constitutional question in a similar case was diminished. Moreover, the lower court\u2019s ruling in each of those cases had an important and immediate adverse public impact. In <em>Roth, </em>the trial court had held unconstitutional statutory provisions authorizing the commitment and detention of certain types of persons by justices of the peace and the House of Refuge. In <em>Steward, </em>under the circuit court\u2019s ruling, the Board of Medical Examiners would have had to have been reconstituted.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">The urgency present in <em>Roth </em>and <em>Steward </em>does not exist in the case at bar. Under Article IV, \u00a7 22, of the Constitution, this Court is precluded from hearing appeals from courts in banc only if, as in this case, the appellant from the in banc court is the party who initially sought in banc review. In all other situations, the Court of Special Appeals and this Court will have appellate jurisdiction. In numerous instances this Court has properly reviewed cases decided by courts in banc. <em>See, e.g., O\u2019Connor v. Moten, </em>307 Md. 644, 516 A.2d 593 (1986); <em>Dean v. State, </em>302 Md. 493, 489 A.2d 22 (1985); <em>Estep v. Estep, </em>285 Md. 416, 420, 404 A.2d 1040, 1042 (1979); <em>Buck v. Folkers, </em>269 Md. 185, 304 A.2d 826, 828 (1973); <em>Costigin v. Bond, supra, </em>65 Md. 122, 3 A. 285. Furthermore, the issue concerning the constitutionality of Rule 2-551 is likely to arise in many in banc cases. Consequently, it is probable that a case will soon arise within our appellate jurisdiction presenting the issue of Rule 2-551\u2019s constitutionality.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">Moreover, the ruling of the in banc court in this case does not have the immediate public impact that the lower court decisions in <em>Roth </em>and <em>Steward </em>had. Until this Court decides the question of Rule 2-551\u2019s validity, parties can fully protect their rights to in banc appeals by adhering to the procedure set forth in Art. IV, \u00a7 22, of the Constitution. And if a party fails to comply with this procedure, he can still take an appeal directly to the Court of Special Appeals. As pointed out by Judge J. Dudley Digges for the Court in <em>Washabaugh v. Washabaugh, </em>285 Md. 393, 408, 404 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>1027 (1979), \u201c[Art. IV,] section 22, when it is applicable, has minimal impact upon the appeal process as all dissatisfied litigants ... have the option of a normal appeal to the Court of Special Appeals____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\">Merely because it may be convenient to some litigants for us to comment upon the constitutionality of Rule 2-551 at this time does not justify our doing so. Rather we should heed the words of Chief Judge Ogle Marbury in <em>State v. Haas, </em>188 Md. 63, 66, 51 A.2d 647, 648 (1947):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-5\">\u201cIt was not the intention of the people of this State in establishing this Court through the several constitutional enactments that it should write treatises on the law. Its duty is to decide <em>bona fide </em>cases____\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">I shall comment upon the constitutionality of Rule 2-551 only because the majority of the Court has decided to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">Initially, the majority misstates the requirements of Art. IV, \u00a7 22, of the Constitution, as interpreted by this Court in <em>Costigin v. Bond, supra. </em>According to the majority opinion, \u201c[t]he provision of \u00a7 22 ... that was later to cause confusion, was the requirement that a party desiring in banc review of a point or question enter on the record an essentially contemporaneous exception.\u201d The majority goes on to discuss the common law requirement of an exception in order to preserve a question for appellate review and then states: \u201cIt is therefore logical and understandable that the draftsmen of \u00a7 22 included a requirement for contemporaneous exceptions as a part of an in banc appeal.\u201d The majority seems to conclude that the \u201cmodernization\u201d of appellate procedure, with the abolition of \u201cexceptions,\u201d has rendered the requirements of \u00a7 22 obsolete.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-9\">Contrary to the majority\u2019s statements, Art. IV, \u00a7 22, does not deal with \u201cexceptions\u201d or with what is generally necessary to preserve a matter for appellate review. The word \u201cexception\u201d is nowhere contained in \u00a7 22. As the majority\u2019s opinion explains, lawyers in 1867 and the draftsmen of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>\u00a7 22 well understood the requirement of an \u201cexception\u201d to preserve a matter for appellate review. If the framers of \u00a7 22 had intended to constitutionalize this need for an exception, they would have used the word \u201cexception\u201d in \u00a7 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">The pertinent language of \u00a7 22 is that \u201cthe motion for such reservation shall be entered of record, during the sitting, at which such decision may be made____\u201d Instead of dealing with what is necessary for appellate preservation, this language relates to the time for electing review by a court in banc. Regardless of whether an \u201cexception\u201d or an \u201cobjection\u201d or an \u201cargument\u201d or no action is required for appellate preservation of a point, \u00a7 22 merely requires that, in order to have review by a court in banc, a motion to that effect be entered \u201cduring the sitting, at which decision may be made.\u201d If a party desires to appeal to a regular appellate court instead of a court in banc, he need do nothing as far as \u00a7 22 is concerned. Nevertheless, in 1867, such party most likely would have been required to note an exception if he desired review by the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">The distinction between the requirements of Art. IV, \u00a7 22, and an exception, was clearly understood by the Court in <em>Costigan v. Bond, </em>when it stated (65 Md. at 124, 8 A. 285):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-8\">\u201cThe exception to a ruling must properly be taken as soon as the ruling is made but this provision of the Constitution intended to give the party taking an exception the entire sitting of the Court (that is the whole time until the Court adjourned for the day) to determine whether he would have his appeal to the Court <em>in banc, </em>or to the Court of Appeals. It would be a very improvident construction of this section to hold that a party might have the whole term of the Court to make up his mind; and we think it is not warranted by the plain meaning of the words.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aqh\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>Since \u00a7 22 relates to the time for an election between appellate courts, and not the matter of appellate preservation, it is no more obsolete today than it was in 1867.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">If the majority were convinced that the Court in <em>Costigin v. Bond </em>erroneously interpreted Art. IV, \u00a7 22, the Court could overrule <em>Costigin. </em>I would, however, strongly dissent from such action. As this Court has pointed out, what became Art. IV, \u00a7 22, was proposed at the Constitutional Convention of 1867 by Delegate Richard H. Alvey of Washington County. <em>See </em>the discussion in <em>Dean v. State, supra, </em>302 Md. at 496-497, 489 A.2d 22, and <em>Washabaugh v. Washabaugh, supra, </em>285 Md. at 396, 404 A.2d 1027. Delegate Alvey later became one of the most distinguished judges ever to sit on this Court. He sat in <em>Costigin v. Bond </em>and joined the Court\u2019s opinion. Moreover, the <em>Costigin </em>interpretation of \u00a7 22 had been consistently recognized and adhered to by the General Assembly and this Court, until the unfortunate adoption of Rule 2-551(a) in 1984. Art. IV, \u00a7 22, was re-adopted by the electorate of Maryland in 1978, without any change in the <em>Costigin </em>interpretation of that provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">Although I would not concur with overruling <em>Costigin v. Bond, </em>such action would be less drastic than the dicta embraced by the majority today.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">Apparently unwilling to overrule <em>Costigin, </em>the majority instead asserts that \u00a7 22 \u201ccontains its own constitutional authority for procedural changes.\u201d In support of this superficially innocuous statement, the majority observes that, by its terms, \u00a7 22 is \u201csubject to such provisions as may hereafter be made by law.\u201d The majority concludes that, by virtue of this grant, coupled with the Court\u2019s general rule-making authority, this Court has the power not merely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>to clarify, develop, or effectuate the terms of \u00a7 22 but also to contradict or amend them. I cannot agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">The Maryland Rules are legislative in nature. <em>Ginnavan v. Silverstone, </em>246 Md. 500, 504-505, 229 A.2d 124, 126 (1967). Therefore, like all legislation, the Maryland Rules are invalid unless consistent with the Constitution. <em>See Washabaugh v. Washabaugh, supra, </em>285 Md. at 411, 404 A.2d 1027; <em>Laurel Canning Co. v. B. &amp; O. R.R., </em>115 Md. 639, 642, 81 A. 126, 127 (1911). In interpreting \u00a7 22 as authorizing this Court to adopt rules that contradict \u00a7 22\u2019s very terms, however, the majority exempts such rules from the requirement of consistency with the Constitution. In effect, the majority concludes that a constitutional provision empowering this Court or the Legislature to implement a constitutional section, constitutes authority to amend the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">The majority\u2019s astonishing conclusion has a number of consequences. First, as to rules adopted under \u00a7 22, judicial review becomes superfluous: no rule thus adopted could be unconstitutional. More important, if the power to implement a constitutional provision includes the power to contradict the terms of that provision, the consequences for Maryland law are unsettling. For example, Article I, \u00a7 3, empowers the General Assembly \u201cto provide by suitable enactment for voting by qualified voters of the State of Maryland ... who are absent at the time of any election in which they are entitled to vote.\u201d Could the General Assembly thereby provide for absentee voting by voters who are neither \u201cqualified\u201d nor \u201centitled to vote\u201d? Article II, \u00a7 IB, provides that \u201c[e]ach candidate who shall seek nomination for Governor, under any method provided by law for such nomination, ... shall at the time of filing for said office designate a candidate for Lieutenant Governor____\u201d In regulating the procedure for obtaining a gubernatorial nomination, could the General Assembly require a candidate not to designate a candidate for Lieutenant Governor?</p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">No court, to the best of my knowledge, has ever held that the power to implement a constitutional provision includes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>the power to contradict the terms of that provision. In fact, in an analogous situation, the Supreme Court reached the opposite conclusion. <em>See Katzenbach v. Morgan, </em>384 U.S. 641, 648-653, 86 S.Ct. 1717, 1722-1725, 16 L.Ed.2d 828 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\">The majority, in an apparent effort to minimize the scope of its singular view of constitutional adjudication, emphasizes that the Art. IV, \u00a7 22, requirement, which is purportedly amended by Rule 2-551, is a procedural provision and that \u201cRule 2-551 do[es] not impair the right to an in banc appeal____\u201d Of course, all of Art IV, \u00a7 22, is procedural. In fact, much of the Maryland Constitution\u2014particularly the Declaration of Rights\u2014is made up of procedural requirements. A noteworthy feature of constitutions in this Country is the extent which they deal with process rather than substantive political matters. Consequently, the apparent limitation placed by the majority, with regard to its view of judicial power to amend the Maryland Constitution, does not significantly minimize the effect of the majority\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">For all of the above reasons, I disagree with the majority\u2019s opinion in this case. I concur in the result only.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-8\">Judges SMITH and COUCH have authorized me to state that they concur with the views expressed herein.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b325-10\">. Art. IV, \u00a7 22, in its entirety provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-11\">\u201cSection 22. Reservation of points or questions for consideration by court in banc.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ATY\">Where any Term is held, or trial conducted by less than the whole number of said Circuit Judges, upon the decision or determination of any point, or question, by the Court, it shall be competent to the party, against whom the ruling or decision is made, upon motion, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>have the point, or question reserved for the consideration of the three Judges of the Circuit, who shall constitute a court in banc for such purpose; and the motion for such reservation shall be entered of record, during the sitting, at which such decision may be made; and the several Circuit Courts shall regulate, by rules, the mode and manner of presenting such points, or questions to the Court in banc, and the decision of the said Court in banc shall be the effective decision in the premises, and conclusive, as against the party, at whose motion said points, or questions were reserved; but such decision in banc shall not preclude the right of Appeal, or writ of error to the adverse party, in those cases, civil or criminal, in which appeal, or writ of error to the Court of Appeals may be allowed by Law. The right of having questions reserved shall not, however, apply to trials of Appeals from judgments of the District Court, nor to criminal cases below the grade of felony, except when the punishment is confinement in the Penitentiary; and this Section shall be subject to such provisions as may hereafter be made by Law.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b326-6\">. <em>See </em>Art. IV, \u00a7 18, of the Constitution.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b327-7\">. \u201cWhere appellate jurisdiction is absent, such statements of the appellate court [on the merits] can logically be no more than <em>dicta, </em>and it is improper for the order of the appellate court and the opinion on which the order is based, to be made conclusive as to the points discussed.\u201d <em>Eastgate Associates v. Apper, 276 </em>Md. 698, 704, 350 A.2d 661 (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b328-5\">. The normal rule against expressing our views in moot cases is based upon policy grounds; it is not a constitutional limitation upon our jurisdiction. <em>Reyes v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>281 Md. 279, 291-299, 380 A.2d 12 (1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b329-7\">. For example, if there is a sufficient public urgency or necessity, will the Court now comply with a request by the Governor and General Assembly for an advisory opinion on an extremely important constitutional question? <em>See </em>the discussion in <em>Reyes v. Prince George\u2019s County, supra, </em>281 Md. at 291-298, 380 A.2d 12.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b329-8\">. The lack of appellate jurisdiction in those cases, however, was not rooted in the Constitution itself.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b333-7\">. Like the majority opinion, the dicta contained in footnote 6 in <em>Washabaugh v. Washabaugh, </em>285 Md. 393, 399, 404 A.2d 1027 (1979), confuses appellate preservation with the election requirement of Art. IV, \u00a7 22. That footnote suggested that a \u201cduly noted objection\u201d might by rule be deemed a \"reservation\u201d under \u00a7 22. The majority today, however, goes far beyond the suggestion in the <em>Washabaugh </em>footnote. The Court now purports to dispense with the need for any action on the day of the ruling or decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
