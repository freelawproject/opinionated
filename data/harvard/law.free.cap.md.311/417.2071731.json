Meeting with no success, Appellant then filed an action in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County, seeking declaratory relief and damages for breach of contract. WSSC interposed a defense of limitations and moved for summary judgment. Judge G.R. Hovey Johnson granted WSSC\u2019s motion on the ground that the complaint had not been filed within three years from the accrual of the cause of action. Appellant entered a timely order of appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, and we issued a writ of certiorari on our own initiative before consideration by that Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-9\">We shall reverse, finding that WSSC\u2019s retirement plan establishes an administrative procedure that has not been completed in this case, and that the circuit court, therefore, should not have entertained the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-10\">Appellant had been an employee of the WSSC for twenty years before retiring on December 31, 1979. At the time of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>his retirement, Appellant was suffering an occupational disability as a result of contact dermatitis of both hands, and he was granted ordinary disability retirement benefits. Appellant believed that he was entitled to the additional benefits specified by the plan, and filed a claim for those benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">In rejecting Appellant\u2019s claim for the higher level of benefits, the Retirement Coordinator stated that: 1) the serious disability contemplated by the plan must result from a single accident or occupational disease, 2) the parties were bound by the extent of disability found by the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Commission, which in this case was twenty-five percent of the body as a whole resulting from the earlier back injury and fifteen percent of each hand resulting from the occupational disease, and 3) that even if successive industrial disabilities could be aggregated under the plan, the disabilities in this case did not add up to more than fifty percent of the body as a whole. The procedural posture of this case prevents us from reaching the underlying substantive questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">The claims procedure mandated by \u00a7 15.07 of WSSC\u2019s retirement plan provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-6\">A claim for benefits under the Plan must be made to the Personnel Director in writing. The Personnel Director shall provide adequate notice in writing to any Participant, joint annuitant or beneficiary whose claim for benefits under the Plan has been denied, setting forth the specific reasons for such denial, written in a manner calculated to be understood by the Participant, joint annuitant or beneficiary. A claimant, or his authorized representative, whose claim has been denied may request a review of the denial by the Secretary of the Commission. In the event the Secretary denies the Participant\u2019s claim, the Participant or his representative may appeal the claim to the Executive Director. The decision of the Executive Director shall be final and binding upon all parties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>On February 20, 1981, Appellant sent his written claim for the higher level of disability retirement benefits to John Prather, who held the title of Retirement Coordinator, and who apparently was authorized to accept claims on behalf of the Personnel Director. From Prather\u2019s letter of reply dated February 27, 1981, we are unable to determine whether the claim was referred to or considered by the Personnel Director. The letter simply stated that the writer had reviewed the requirements of the plan and concluded that Appellant did not qualify because he did not have a single award from the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Commission finding more than fifty percent permanent disability, and because the disability award for the earlier back injury could not be considered. The letter concluded, \u201cShould you have any questions, please contact me at once,\u201d and was signed by Prather over the designation \u201cRetirement Coordinator.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\">Appellant consulted with the attorney who was representing him in the worker\u2019s compensation claim, and on March 9 that attorney wrote Prather requesting a copy of \u201cthe master legal document or portions thereof that deal with eligibility for job related disability benefits.\u201d Prather responded by forwarding an extract copy of Article VII of the Plan, which dealt with disability retirement pension benefits. Prather did not then, or at any other time, send to Appellant or his attorney a copy of \u00a7 15.07, which detailed the claims procedure, nor did he advise either of them concerning the proper procedure to be followed. On March 17, Appellant\u2019s attorney wrote to Prather, stating that he disagreed with Prather\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 7.02 of the plan. He enclosed a report from the treating dermatologist which indicated that Appellant was ninety to one hundred percent disabled as a result of contact dermatitis, and asked that Prather reevaluate the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">Nearly two months later, on May 13, 1981, Prather wrote to Appellant\u2019s attorney, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-6\">As you requested, I have reviewed Mr. Ira Y. Quesenberry\u2019s claim to receive Job-Related Disability Benefits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>In my opinion, however, Mr. Quesenberry does not qualify for a job-related disability pension because he is not more than 50% disabled, as determined by the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Commission. He was awarded a rating of 25% permanent disability of the body in 1974, and 15% disability of each hand in 1980. A 15% rating for each hand does not add up to 30% disability. Regardless of whether we interpret Section 7.02 of the Plan to require that the disability arising from a single accident or from more than one accident, Mr. Quesenberry does not qualify.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-5\">I believe that this should answer any questions you may have concerning Mr. Quesenberry\u2019s request.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-6\">Sincerely,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-7\">/s/ John E. Prather Retirement Coordinator</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">More than two years later, on September 6, 1983, Appellant\u2019s attorney again wrote Prather, restating his earlier position, and concluding as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-9\">I will forbear filing a lawsuit in this matter for a period of thirty (30) days to allow you to reconsider your position. At the expiration of that time, suit will be filed to enforce the provisions of Section 7.02 as well as requesting appropriate damages and attorneys fees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-10\">Prather\u2019s response on October 5, 1983, that \u201cour position with regard to your client\u2019s disability claim remains unchanged\u201d was again given over his signature and designation as \u201cRetirement Coordinator.\u201d Appellant filed suit on July 13, 1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-11\">WSSC contends that Appellant\u2019s cause of action arose on February 27, 1981, when Prather first advised him that he did not qualify for increased disability benefits. Accordingly, the Commission argues, the action of July 13, 1984, was not timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-12\">Appellant\u2019s argument is slightly more involved. He first contends that his cause of action did not accrue until his claim was finally denied, and that under the terms of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>Plan that denial did not occur until there was a third-tier rejection by the Executive Director. He next argues that Prather had been authorized by the Personnel Director, the Secretary of the Commission, and the Executive Director of Plan to act in their stead, and that Prather\u2019s three letters to Appellant represented rejections of the claim by each of those persons. Finally, he says, Prather\u2019s last letter was sent on October 5, 1983; thus, the action of July 13, 1984, was timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">We do not accept either argument, although we do agree with Appellant that he was required to exhaust the avenues of review and appeal specified by the Plan before seeking judicial review. Initially, we consider whether the Plan mandates an administrative proceeding, creates contract rights enforceable by a civil action, or, as WSSC suggests, represents nothing more than the largess of a beneficent employer which may be granted or withheld at will.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">Previous decisions of the appellate courts of this State make it clear that the \u201cgratuity\u201d argument has been rejected with respect to both private and public pension plans. <em>See Food Fair Stores v. Greeley, </em>264 Md. 105, 285 A.2d 632 (1972) and <em>City of Frederick v. Quinn, </em>35 Md.App. 626, 371 A.2d 724 (1977). <em>See also Dahl v. Brunswick Corp., </em>277 Md. 471, 476, 356 A.2d 221 (1976) (holding that employer policies may become contractual obligations when, with knowledge of their existence, employees start or continue work for the employer).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">The rights conferred by a pension plan are contractual in nature, although under certain circumstances they may be modified by the unilateral action of the employer. <em>Saxton v. Board of Trustees, </em>266 Md. 690, 694, 296 A.2d 367 (1972); <em>Food Fair Stores v. Greeley, supra, </em>264 Md. at 114, 285 A.2d 632; <em>City of Frederick v. Quinn, supra, </em>35 Md.App. at 634, 371 A.2d 724.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">In this case, however, the engine for enforcement of those rights is not an action at law on the contract, but rather the administrative procedure mandated by the Plan. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>WSSC is a state agency, created by the Legislature through a public general law. <em>Wash. Sub. San. Comm\u2019n v. Mitchell &amp; Best, </em>303 Md. 544, 550, 495 A.2d 30 (1985); <em>Donocam Assoc. v. Wash. Sub. San. Comm\u2019n, </em>302 Md. 501, 510, 489 A.2d 26 (1985); <em>Prince George\u2019s Co. v. Blumberg, </em>288 Md. 275, 294-95, 418 A.2d 1155 (1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 1083, 101 S.Ct. 869, 66 L.Ed.2d 808; <em>Katz v. Washington Sub. San. Comm\u2019n, </em>284 Md. 503, 509-12, 397 A.2d 1027 (1979). The Legislature specifically authorized WSSC to formulate and adopt a pension and retirement plan for its employees. Maryland Code (1957, 1983 Repl. Vol.) Art. 29, \u00a7 11-113. The procedures specified in the Plan for initial consideration and subsequent review of a claim are to be performed by the governmental agency, through those employed by it for that purpose, and this adjudicative process is accordingly an administrative proceeding. <em>See </em>1 Davis, <em>Administrative Law Treatise </em>\u00a7 1:1 (2d Ed.1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">As a general rule, administrative remedies must be exhausted before resort may be had to the courts. <em>Collins v. Foster, </em>302 Md. 328, 330, 487 A.2d 1189 (1985); <em>Prince George\u2019s Co. v. Blumberg, supra, </em>288 Md. at 283, 418 A.2d 1155. Although there are well-defined exceptions to that rule, <em>Prince George\u2019s Co. v. Blumberg, supra, </em>288 Md. at 284-85, 418 A.2d 1155, none is applicable to the facts of this case. Appellant was obliged to pursue to a conclusion the remedies provided by the Plan, and he has not done so. Appellant is incorrect when he states that Prather\u2019s three letters represented decisions at each of the three levels required by the administrative procedure. Assuming, without deciding, that the evidence of record was sufficient to establish a delegation of authority, Appellant\u2019s argument falls because neither the Personnel Director nor the Executive Director could lawfully delegate the decision-making responsibility imposed upon them by the Plan. Appellant\u2019s claim involves important property interests, and Appellant is entitled to administrative due process. Although \u00a7\u00a7 15.-03 and 15.04 of the Plan specifically contemplate broad delegations of authority by the Secretary of the Commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>sion, nothing in the Plan gives a similar right of delegation to the Personnel Director or to the Executive Director. In an analogous situation, <em>Comptroller v. Myers, </em>59 Md.App. 118, 474 A.2d 941 (1984), where a statute dealing with dismissal of classified employees required that the final decision be made or approved by the Secretary of Personnel, the Court of Special Appeals held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-5\">[Although the Secretary may delegate to an appointee his authority to hear, investigate, and determine charges brought against a classified employee, the decision of that appointee is not final until approved by the Secretary. 59 Md.App. at 126, 474 A.2d 941.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">We do not suggest that each official considering the claim or appeal must afford Appellant a hearing. We note, however, that when an agency performs an adjudicative function involving property rights of this nature, the right to a hearing at some stage of the process may be required to accommodate the constitutional requirement of due process.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Prince George\u2019s Co. v. Blumberg, supra, </em>288 Md. at 295, 418 A.2d 1155; <em>Hyson v. Montgomery County, </em>242 Md. 55, 67, 217 A.2d 578 (1966); 2 Davis, <em>Administrative Law Treatise </em>\u00a7 12:1 (2d Ed.1979). Likewise, we do not suggest that administrative bodies performing quasi-judicial functions may not avail themselves of summary dispositions when the relevant adjudicative facts are not in dispute. We do make clear, however, that when, as here, the decision is required to be made or approved by a designated official, that official may not delegate the ultimate decision-making responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">This record does not show that any of the three officials designated by the Plan made a decision concerning Appellant\u2019s claim. The administrative process has clearly not been completed. Indeed, except for the filing of the claim, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>it may not have begun in any meaningful sense. Appellant is entitled to have his claim considered and to receive the initial decision of the Personnel Director. If that proves unfavorable, he may avail himself of the additional procedures provided by the Plan. When these procedures have been exhausted, he is entitled to seek judicial review. Because the administrative remedies have not yet been exhausted, Appellant\u2019s resort to the courts is premature.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR PRINCE GEORGE\u2019S COUNTY REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT FOR THE ENTRY OF AN ORDER DISMISSING THE CASE FOR FAILURE TO EXHAUST ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES.
