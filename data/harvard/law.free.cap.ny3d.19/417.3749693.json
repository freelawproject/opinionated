He was sentenced as a second felony offender, on the basis of a previous conviction in the United States District Court for the Southern District of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>New York of conspiracy to distribute heroin, and to possess it with intent to distribute (21 USC \u00a7 846, 21 USC \u00a7 841 [a] [1]). The Appellate Division affirmed his conviction and sentence, rejecting the argument that he was improperly adjudicated a predicate felon <em>(People v Ramos, </em>80 AD3d 537 [1st Dept 2011]). A Judge of this Court granted leave to appeal (17 NY3d 821 [2011]), and we now modify the Appellate Division\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">Penal Law \u00a7 70.06 (1) (b) says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-6\">\u201cFor the purpose of determining whether a prior conviction is a predicate felony conviction the following criteria shall apply:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-7\">\u201c(i) The conviction must have been in this state of a felony, or in any other jurisdiction of an offense for which a sentence to a term of imprisonment in excess of one year or a sentence of death was authorized and is authorized in this state.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">We have interpreted the words \u201cis authorized in this state\u201d to require that the crime of which the defendant was convicted in another jurisdiction include all the essential elements of a New York felony <em>(People v Muniz, </em>74 NY2d 464, 467-468 [1989]). As a general rule (with an exception not relevant here), inquiry \u201cis limited to a comparison of the crimes\u2019 elements as they are respectively defined in the foreign and New York penal statutes\u201d <em>(id.). </em>It is immaterial that the crime actually committed in the foreign jurisdiction may be the equivalent of a felony in New York, if the foreign statute would have permitted a conviction for conduct that did not amount to a New York felony <em>(see People v Olah, </em>300 NY 96, 98-99 [1949]; <em>People v Gonzalez, </em>61 NY2d 586 [1984]; <em>People v Muniz, </em>74 NY2d at 467-469). We have referred to our test as one of \u201cstrict equivalency,\u201d and have observed that \u201ctechnical distinctions between the New York and foreign penal statutes can preclude use of a prior felony as a predicate for enhanced sentencing\u201d <em>(Matter of North v Board of Examiners of Sex Offenders of State of N.Y., </em>8 NY3d 745, 751 [2007]).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-9\">Thus, to decide if defendant here was properly sentenced as a predicate felon, we must compare the federal drug conspiracy statute, 21 USC \u00a7 846, with our own statutes prohibiting conspiracy, Penal Law \u00a7 105.00 <em>et seq. </em>When we do so, we find a conspicuous difference: The commission of an overt act by one of the conspirators in furtherance of the conspiracy is required under New York, but not under federal, law. Penal Law \u00a7 105.20 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>says: \u201cA person shall not be convicted of conspiracy unless an overt act is alleged and proved to have been committed by one of the conspirators in furtherance of the conspiracy.\u201d The same is not true under the federal statute, as the United States Supreme Court held in <em>United States v Shabani </em>(513 US 10, 11 [1994]): \u201cThis case asks us to consider whether 21 [USC] \u00a7 846, the drug conspiracy statute, requires the Government to prove that a conspirator committed an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy. We conclude that it does not.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">Because New York law requires proof of an element that federal law does not, defendant\u2019s federal conspiracy conviction cannot serve as a predicate.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">Seeking an escape from this conclusion, the People argue that New York\u2019s \u201covert act\u201d requirement is not an \u201celement\u201d of the crime of conspiracy, but merely an \u201cevidentiary requirement\u201d\u2014 analogous, the People suggest, to the corroboration requirements imposed by certain other sections of the Penal Law <em>(see </em>Penal Law \u00a7\u00a7 115.15, 130.16, 255.30). We find the argument unpersuasive. In several cases, beginning in the nineteenth century and continuing into the twenty-first, we have either explicitly labeled the overt act as an \u201celement\u201d of the crime of conspiracy, or have used words equivalent in meaning to \u201celement\u201d to describe it. Thus in <em>People v Sheldon </em>(139 NY 251, 265 [1893]), we said: \u201cThe object of the statute [requiring an overt act] was to require something more than a mere agreement to <em>constitute </em>a criminal conspiracy\u201d (emphasis added). In <em>People v Hines </em>(284 NY 93, 112 [1940]), we said: \u201c[A]n overt act is an essential <em>ingredient </em>of the crime of conspiracy. (Penal Law, \u00a7 583.) Whatever the relative weight of the unlawful agreement and of the overt act as necessary <em>parts </em>of the crime, the latter is a required <em>elemenf1 </em>(emphasis added). In <em>People v McGee </em>(49 NY2d 48, 57-58 [1979]), we said: \u201cthe overt act itself is <em>not </em>the crime in a conspiracy prosecution; it is merely an <em>element </em>of the crime\u201d (emphasis added). In <em>People v Caban </em>(5 NY3d 143, 149 [2005]), we said: \u201cA conspiracy <em>consists </em>of an agreement to commit an underlying substantive crime (here, murder), coupled with an overt act committed by one of the conspirators in furtherance of the conspiracy\u201d (emphasis added). And in <em>People v Washington </em>(8 NY3d 565, 570 [2007]), we repeated the quoted language from <em>Caban.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">If we were to analyze the question without the aid of precedent, the result would be the same: The overt act is an element of the crime. It is a fact whose existence the People must plead <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>and prove to obtain a conviction. It differs from corroboration, which is a kind of evidence required to prove a fact. The analogy the People would have us draw fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be modified by remitting the case to Supreme Court for resentencing, and as so modified, affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">Chief Judge Lippman and Judges Ciparick, Graffeo, Read, Pigott and Jones concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">Order modified, etc.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
