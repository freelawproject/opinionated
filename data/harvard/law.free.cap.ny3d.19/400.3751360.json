Defendant is HIV positive and has a long history of psychiatric illness. His arrest was precipitated by his bizarre behavior and open possession of marijuana in the reception area of his primary physician\u2019s office.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-8\">Although the indictment, in its top count,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> does little more than track the language of Penal Law \u00a7 120.11, the People in their bill of particulars specified that the dangerous instruments) to which the indictment referred were defendant\u2019s teeth. However, in a prior biting case, <em>People v Owusu </em>(93 NY2d 398 [1999]), this Court had held that an assailant\u2019s teeth could not be deemed \u201cinstruments\u201d within the definition of the Penal Law; indeed, <em>Owusu </em>held categorically that \u201can individual\u2019s body part does not constitute an instrument\u201d and may not, even if used dangerously to produce injury, be a \u201cdangerous instrument\u201d within the meaning of Penal Law \u00a7 10.00 (13) <em>(id. </em>at 399). Following her receipt of the People\u2019s bill of particulars, then, defendant\u2019s attorney moved by letter application to append to her client\u2019s previously denied omnibus motion an application based upon <em>Owusu. </em>She included with her letter a copy of that decision, noting her view that it bore directly upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>the viability of the indictment\u2019s first count. She said, \u201cthis case speaks to the issue of teeth as a potentially deadly weapon or dangerous instrument. This case held that \u2018human body parts such as appellant\u2019s teeth could not constitute a dangerous weapon . . . \u201d Counsel requested on this purely legal ground the first count\u2019s dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">County Court, recognizing that this was not a routine omnibus application, responded to it both orally and in a separate written decision. Implicitly acknowledging that a prosecution premised on the use of teeth as dangerous instruments was not viable after <em>Owusu, </em>the court expressed the view' that the aggravated assault count could be sustained instead on the theory that the dangerous instrument to which the count referred was defendant\u2019s saliva. Defendant\u2019s saliva \u201cinfected with the AIDS virus,\u201d the court believed, was a substance \u201creadily capable of causing death or other serious physical injury\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and, as such, qualified as a dangerous instrument for purposes of the aggravated assault statute. Defendant\u2019s teeth, the court explained, were only the means for injecting the dangerous substance into the victim\u2019s body.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">Just before the trial\u2019s scheduled commencement, County Court announced that based on \u201ccontinuing discussions\u201d an agreement had been reached that defendant would plead guilty to the indictment\u2019s top three counts. After advising defendant of the rights he would be waiving by entering the contemplated plea, and of the bargained for sentence, the court separately noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-8\">\u201cBased upon discussions, you would not be waiving your right to appeal, and you would have your right to appeal, which is one of the things that you had requested as part of your plea. And the Court, <em>based upon certain circumstances that have come up in rulings that I have made, </em>that, in fact, you would have your right to appeal continue\u201d (emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-9\">It is clear that County Court was here referring specifically to its ruling that defendant\u2019s saliva could qualify under the Penal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>Law as a dangerous instrument. The court understood the ruling to be pivotal to the prosecution,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and the record discloses no other issue whose reservation could conceivably have been instrumental in inducing defendant\u2019s plea to the indictment\u2019s top three counts. Defendant\u2019s counsel, moreover, plainly believed that her client possessed a meritorious claim completely decisive of the indictment\u2019s most serious charge. Her insistence upon the reservation of that claim, then, would have been a representational imperative.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">Defendant\u2019s reservation of appellate rights did not, however, avail him at the Appellate Division, where the judgment convicting him was affirmed on the ground that his appellate claims had been forfeited by his plea (77 AD3d 1442 [2010]). A Judge of this Court granted defendant permission to appeal (16 NY3d 835 [2011]), and we now modify to vacate defendant\u2019s conviction for aggravated assault and to dismiss the corresponding count of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">A guilty plea, we have observed, \u201cgenerally marks the end of a criminal case, not a gateway to further litigation\u201d <em>(People v Hansen, </em>95 NY2d 227, 230 [2000]). Consistently, we have deemed appellate claims challenging what is competently and independently established by a plea forfeited <em>(see id.), </em>even where the plea was induced and entered upon an assurance that such claims would survive. In <em>People v Thomas </em>(53 NY2d 338, 340 [1981]) we held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-7\">\u201c[t]he legal sufficiency of a conceded set of facts to support a judgment of conviction entered upon a guilty plea may not be saved for appellate review by conditioning the plea on defendant\u2019s right to appeal that issue, even though the prosecutor consents to, and the Trial Judge approves, the entry of such a conditional plea.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b483-8\">We explained that it would be logically inconsistent to permit a defendant to enter a plea of guilty based on particular admitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>facts, yet to allow that defendant contemporaneously to reserve the right to challenge on appeal the sufficiency of those facts to support a conviction, had there been a trial <em>(see id. </em>at 344). The \u201csolemn act\u201d of entering a plea, itself sufficing as a conviction, we said, should not be permitted to be used as a device for a defendant to avoid a trial while maintaining a claim of factual innocence <em>(see id. </em>at 344-345).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">By the same token, however, where an appellate claim does not challenge what is legitimately established by a plea or where it has been deemed inconsistent with public policy to submerge an appellate claim within a plea, we have recognized that the forfeiture doctrine should not apply. As we noted in <em>People v Lee </em>(58 NY2d 491 [1983])\u2014where we held appellate claims as to the constitutionality of a penal statute not encompassed by the plea forfeiture doctrine\u2014Thomas\u2019s application of the doctrine was expressly limited to situations in which the issue proposed for appellate review was the sufficiency of the facts admitted in connection with the plea to support the conviction <em>(see Lee, </em>58 NY2d at 494 n, citing <em>Thomas, </em>53 NY2d at 344); <em>Thomas </em>was in no way inconsistent with the limiting principle recognized in <em>Lee, </em>that where an appellate claim is not inconsistent with what is properly established by the plea, it is not forfeited <em>(see id. </em>at 493-494; <em>see also People v Taylor, </em>65 NY2d 1, 5 [1985] [\u201csince a plea usually removes the issue of factual guilt from a case, resolution of the question (of what is forfeited by the plea) may be guided by determining whether the claim relates to the factual elements of the crime charged, or to some other, fundamental matter\u201d]). Of course, that principle was not novel in <em>Lee (see e.g., Menna v New York, </em>423 US 61, 63 n 2 [1975] [\u201cA guilty plea . . . simply renders irrelevant those constitutional violations not logically inconsistent with the valid establishment of factual guilt and which do not stand in the way of conviction, if factual guilt is validly established\u201d]).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">If the question reserved for appeal in this case were whether there was evidence to make out the crime of aggravated assault, the reservation would, under <em>Thomas, </em>be ineffective; the undisturbed plea would operate to forfeit the appellate claim. Somewhat paradoxically, however, such a plea, although effective to the extent of the forfeiture, would be subject to vacatur by reason of having been induced by a promise of appellate review the performance of which <em>Thomas </em>forbids <em>(see </em>53 NY2d at 344; <em>and see People v Di Raffaele, </em>55 NY2d 234, 241 [1982]). In the event we find his <em>Owusu </em>based challenge to his conviction forfeited by his plea, defendant has asked for, and would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>entitled to have, his plea back. Defendant\u2019s <em>Owusu </em>claim would then be litigated in the context of the reinstituted prosecution through a trial and any ensuing appeals\u2014hardly a victory for the principle that a plea should function as a bulwark against further litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">We do not believe that the interposition of so many steps should be required to resolve the particular very basic, purely legal question defendant has raised, namely, whether he has been charged with and has pleaded to a cognizable offense, where the accusatory instrument, as refined by the People\u2019s bill of particulars and the trial court\u2019s ruling, alleges the commission of aggravated assault by use of part of the defendant\u2019s person as a dangerous instrument. The address of that question depends not at all on the particular evidence supporting the accusation, nor is it logically precluded by defendant\u2019s admissions in his plea to the extent that those admissions are understood as responsive to the charge framed by County Court\u2019s ruling. This is because the relevant claim is that there is no set of facts that could be proved, or to which a defendant could plead, that would establish guilt of aggravated assault upon the theory alleged. A plea of course has extraordinary utility; it is uniquely capable of establishing inculpatory facts, even when those facts have not otherwise been satisfactorily adduced. It is, however, not a competent proxy for a legally (as opposed to a factually) viable theory of prosecution. A defendant can admit facts, but cannot by his or her admission mint an offense for which the law does not already provide.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">In the present unusual circumstance, where the claim defendant would raise is essentially that he was never charged, under the indictment\u2019s top count, with an extant crime, the rationale for the forfeiture doctrine\u2014namely, that what the defendant would challenge has been conclusively and independently established by his or her plea\u2014is not applicable to bar review. To so hold does not impair the legitimate utility of pleas in concluding litigation. And, we signal no departure from the rule that, ordinarily, guilty pleas operate to forfeit appellate claims respecting nonjurisdictional defects in the underlying proceedings <em>(see People v Konieczny, </em>2 NY3d 569, 572 [2004]). We simply recognize, as we have in numerous other contexts <em>(see Hansen, </em>95 NY2d at 230-231), that pleas are not properly interposed to preclude appellate review of issues that they are not competent to, or for reasons of public policy should not, conclude.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">Inasmuch as defendant\u2019s plea does not operate to forfeit his challenge to the indictment\u2019s top count, we turn to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>substance of his claim. Although County Court was of the view that defendant\u2019s saliva could be a \u201cdangerous instrument\u201d within the meaning of Penal Law \u00a7 10.00 (13)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> because it is a \u201csubstance,\u201d we began our analysis in <em>Owusu </em>by recognizing that \u201ca part of one\u2019s body is not encompassed by the terms \u2018article\u2019 or \u2018substance\u2019 as used in the statute\u201d (93 NY2d at 400-401). From that basic and, we thought, uncontroversial premise, we continued, to address the question of whether a body part, although not a \u201csubstance\u201d or an \u201carticle,\u201d might nonetheless be deemed an \u201cinstrument\u201d under the statute. In concluding that an individual\u2019s body part could not be so deemed and, thus, that body parts, even if otherwise corresponding to the terms \u201csubstance,\u201d \u201carticle\u201d or \u201cinstrument,\u201d categorically could not qualify as \u201cdangerous instruments\u201d within the meaning of Penal Law \u00a7 10.00 (13), we sought not simply to reach a textually and historically correct understanding of what the Legislature meant to encompass (and to exclude), but to avoid the anomalies that would result if criminal liability varied with the corporeal attributes of assailants and their victims. We explained that the inclusion of body parts within the universe of potential \u201cdangerous instruments\u201d would, under Penal Law \u00a7 10.00 (13), render \u201cthe size of the perpetrator, his weight, strength, etc., as well as any infirmities or frailties of the victim . . . relevant in understanding one\u2019s ability to cause serious physical injury or death. A sliding scale of criminal liability (the extraordinary man anomaly) would be the result\u201d <em>(Owusu, </em>93 NY2d at 404). To avoid such an anomaly, our jurisprudence, we observed, had \u201cdrawn the line at a reasonable interpretation of the term \u2018instrument\u2019 and ha[d] not included within it a person\u2019s hands or other body parts\u201d <em>(id.). </em>\u201cOwusu\u2019s teeth came with him\u201d and thus could not themselves qualify as a predicate to heighten his criminal liability beyond that justified by his victim\u2019s injury <em>(id. </em>at 405). Because defendant\u2019s saliva too \u201ccame with him\u201d\u2014 indeed, with his teeth\u2014its utility for penal enhancement may not be treated differently.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">It is important to stress that the limitation we recognized in <em>Owusu </em>and which we now reaffirm does nothing to diminish the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>State\u2019s power to punish a defendant according to the harm actually inflicted <em>(see id. </em>at 405). All that is limited is its power to heighten liability solely by reason of corporeal attributes.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be modified by dismissing the count of the indictment charging aggravated assault upon a police officer or peace officer, and remitting to Herkimer County Court for resentencing and, as so modified, affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">Judges Ciparick, Graffeo, Read, Smith, Pigott and Jones concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">Order modified, etc.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b481-9\">. The statute provides in its entirety:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-10\"><em>\u201cA </em>person is guilty of aggravated assault upon a police officer or a peace officer when, with intent to cause serious physical injury to a person whom he knows or reasonably should know to be a police officer or a peace officer engaged in the course of performing his official duties, he causes such injury by means of a deadly weapon or dangerous instrument.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b481-11\">. In connection with the doctor\u2019s office incident, defendant was also charged with two counts of assault in the second degree, resisting arrest and criminal possession of marijuana in the fifth degree.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b482-10\">. Whether saliva containing the HIV virus is in fact \u201creadily capable of causing death or other serious physical injury\u201d is an issue that we do not reach. For the reasons that follow, neither should it have been reached by County Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b483-9\">. As the court explained to the jury shortly after taking defendant\u2019s plea: \u201cthe question was whether\u2014there\u2019s some very technical legal questions that have been batted around in this case as to what would involve a dangerous instrument, which is something you would have had to have made a decision on. <em>And I had made a ruling that you were going to hear it based on the fact that one of the definitions of dangerous instrument is a term called \u2018substance, </em>\u2019 <em>and that his saliva was, in fact, a substance that could have caused </em>death; and that when he bit the officers, he was only using his teeth to inject a substance into their body\u201d (emphasis supplied).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b486-6\">. The statute provides: \u201c \u2018Dangerous instrument\u2019 means any instrument, article or substance, including a \u2018vehicle\u2019 as that term is defined in this section, which, under the circumstances in which it is used, attempted to be used or threatened to be used, is readily capable of causing death or other serious physical injury.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
