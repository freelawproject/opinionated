Petitioners, various county bar associations, challenged the proposed plan and its implementing regulations <em>(see </em>43 RCNY 13-01 <em>et </em>seq.) as violative of County Law \u00a7 722 and Municipal Home Rule Law \u00a7 11 (1) (e). We conclude that the City may assign conflict cases to institutional providers, that its ability to do so is not contingent on the consent of the county bar associations and that the City\u2019s proposed indigent defense plan does not run afoul of the County Law or Municipal Home Rule Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-7\">L</p>\n<p id=\"b793-8\">In 1965, the legislature enacted article 18-B of the County Law (County Law \u00a7 722) in response to the Supreme Court\u2019s landmark decision in <em>Gideon v Wainwright </em>(372 US 335 [1963]), which held that the fundamental right to counsel in criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>cases creates an attendant obligation of the state to provide indigent defendants with representation <em>(see id. </em>at 344-345). Accordingly, County Law \u00a7 722 mandates that \u201cthe governing body of the city in which a county is wholly contained shall place in operation ... a plan for providing counsel to persons charged with a crime . . . who are financially unable to obtain counsel.\u201d Pursuant to section 722, New York City may adopt any one of the following plans for representation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b794-5\">\u201c1. Representation by a public defender appointed pursuant to county law article eighteen-A.[<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b794-6\">\u201c2. . . . representation by counsel furnished by a private legal aid bureau or society . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b794-7\">\u201c3. (a) Representation by counsel furnished pursuant to either or both of the following: a plan of a bar association in each county or the city in which a county is wholly contained whereby: (i) the services of private counsel are rotated and coordinated by an administrator, and such administrator may be compensated for such service; or (ii) such representation is provided by an office of conflict defender . . . [<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b794-8\">\u201c4. Representation according to a plan containing a combination of any of the foregoing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b794-9\">Subdivision (4) further provides that when the City has not enacted a plan conforming with subdivisions (3) or (4) and \u201cthe judge ... is satisfied that a conflict of interest prevents the assignment of counsel pursuant to the plan in operation . . . the judge . . . may assign any attorney in such . . . city.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b794-10\">Also in 1965, the Association of the Bar of the City of New York (not a party to this case) and petitioners proposed a joint plan for indigent defense (the 1965 Bar Plan) that, consistent with section 722 (4), \u201ccombine[d] representation by a private legal aid society [pursuant to subdivision (2)] and by private attorneys [pursuant to subdivision (3)].\u201d Under the 1965 Bar Plan, the county bar associations would submit a list of names <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>of qualified attorneys to administrators, appointed by the Appellate Divisions of the First and Second Judicial Departments and paid by the City, who would prepare and coordinate panels of attorneys pursuant to article 18-B. The 1965 Bar Plan designated the Legal Aid Society as the primary provider of indigent defense services. It further provided that where the \u201ccourt deems the assignment of other counsel to be required in the interest of justice because of ... a conflict of interest . . . the court shall appoint counsel\u201d from an 18-B panel. Finally, the 1965 Bar Plan granted the First and Second Departments authority to promulgate rules with respect to the plan\u2019s operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-4\">In November 1965, then Mayor Robert F. Wagner, Jr., issued New York City Executive Order No. 178 establishing a combined option plan as proposed by the bar associations for indigent defense pursuant to County Law \u00a7 722 (4). In conformity with the 1965 Bar Plan, Executive Order No. 178 designated the Legal Aid Society as the primary provider of counsel to indigent defendants and stated that \u201c[i]n those cases where by reason of a conflict of interest . . . the Legal Aid Society declines to represent any such defendant, such defendant shall be represented by counsel furnished pursuant to the [Bar Plan].\u201d It should be noted that at that time the Legal Aid Society was the only institutional provider of legal services in New York City.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">While in subsequent decades the provision of indigent defense functioned in accordance with the plan established by Executive Order No. 178, it was not wholly without practical alterations. In 1980 and 1991, the First and Second Judicial Departments adopted new rules, which the county bar associations approved, whereby committees designated by the Appellate Division would perform the function of screening attorneys for the 18-B panels <em>(see </em>22 NYCRR 612.0 <em>et seq.; </em>22 NYCRR 678.1 <em>et seq.). </em>Beginning in 1996, the City began contracting with other institutional providers in addition to the Legal Aid Society. Presently, institutional providers furnishing indigent defense services also include Staten Island Legal Services, the Bronx Defenders, Brooklyn Defender Services, New York County Defender Services, Neighborhood Defender Service of Harlem and Queens Law Associates.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">In June 2008, recognizing that the Legal Aid Society was no longer the sole institutional provider of primary defense counsel, Mayor Michael Bloomberg issued New York City Executive Order No. 118 of 2008, which repealed New York City Executive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>Order No. 178 of 1965. Executive Order No. 118 provided that the Office of the Criminal Justice Coordinator (CJC) \u201cshall select Providers through a competitive procurement process,\u201d to serve as primary counsel at both the trial and appellate levels. Conflict representation would continue to be provided exclusively by 18-B panel attorneys.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">On January 6, 2010, the City adopted chapter 13 of title 43 of the Rules of the City of New York (43 RCNY 13-01 <em>et seq.) </em>entitled \u201cIndigent Defense Plan for the City of New York.\u201d Of great significance to this appeal, chapter 13 addressed the assignment of conflict counsel, providing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-6\">\u201cIn any case where, due to conflict of interest or other appropriate reason, Providers decline or are unable to represent an indigent person at the trial or on appeal in a criminal matter, counsel shall be furnished by attorneys assigned by the ACP [Assigned Counsel Plan] from the appropriate Criminal Defense Panel of the Appellate Division, First or Second Judicial Department, <em>or by alternate providers[</em><footnotemark>3</footnotemark>] <em>selected by the CJC through the City\u2019s procurement process\u201d </em>(43 RCNY 13-03 [emphasis added]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b796-7\">Thus, chapter 13 permits the assignment of conflict cases to institutional providers in addition to 18-B panel attorneys. Chapter 13 also created the Office of the Assigned Counsel Plan (OACP), which is \u201coverseen by two Administrators in consultation with the Presiding Justices of the First and Second Judicial Departments\u201d and is \u201cresponsible for management of the City\u2019s Criminal Defense Panels\u201d (43 RCNY 13-01).</p>\n<p id=\"b796-8\">In February 2010, as per the procedures established in chapter 13, the City issued a request for proposals (the RFP) inviting institutional bids for the provision of indigent criminal defense services and for the assignment of conflict cases. The RFP stated that \u201cthe City is interested in providing representation in conflict cases and anticipates issuing awards to vendors who propose to provide representation in conflict cases.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b796-9\">The City subsequently issued two addendums to the RFP A February 8, 2010 addendum clarified that \u201c[t]he City has not decided and the RFP does not state that a definite number of providers will be selected for each county.\u201d The second <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>addendum was issued March 2, 2010, the same day that Mayor Bloomberg issued New York City Executive Order No. 132 of 2010, setting forth the City\u2019s new indigent defense plan. Executive Order No. 132 repealed New York City Executive Order No. 178 of 1965 again, but provided that the 18-B panels created by the latter \u201cshall continue to exist and shall be administered in accordance with the rules of the Appellate Division, First and Second Judicial Departments.\u201d The second addendum presented a contradiction, however, stating that the City\u2019s new indigent defense plan conformed with County Law \u00a7 722 (2), the \u201cprivate legal aid bureau or society\u201d option, and that the prior section 722 (3) option, by which representation was furnished pursuant to \u201ca plan of a bar association,\u201d specifically, the 1965 Bar Plan, was \u201cno longer in effect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b797-4\">Petitioners<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> initiated this hybrid CPLR article 78 proceeding and declaratory judgment action in June 2010 challenging the legality of Executive Order No. 132, 43 RCNY chapter 13, the RFP and its addenda. Petitioners sought, among other things, a judgment declaring that chapter 13, Executive Order No. 132 and the amended RFP violate article 18-B and Municipal Home Rule Law \u00a7 11 (1) (e) and declaring any contracts entered into pursuant to the order and RFP invalid. As relevant here, petitioners contended that the City\u2019s proposed indigent defense plan was not a combination plan as set forth in County Law \u00a7 722 (4) because the county bar associations had not approved of the selective retention and abandonment of portions of the 1965 Bar Plan and, therefore, the new plan did not utilize a \u201cplan of a bar association\u201d pursuant to section 722 (3). Petitioners also moved to preliminarily enjoin respondents, the City of New York, Mayor Bloomberg and the CJC (collectively, the City), from implementing Executive Order No. 132 and the contract procurement process prescribed in the RFP</p>\n<p id=\"Apo\">Subsequently, on July 13, 2010, Mayor Bloomberg issued New York City Executive Order No. 136 of 2010, which .repealed the preceding Executive Orders,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-5\">\u201cexcept that Criminal Defense Panels created under the authority of Executive Order [No.] 178 of 1965 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>and pursuant to the plan submitted by bar associations in accordance with subdivision 3 of section 722 of the County Law shall continue to exist and shall be administered in accordance with the rules of the Appellate Division, First and Second Judicial Departments.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">In response to Executive Order No. 136, petitioners amended their pleading, asserting that the most recent order \u201cattempts to selectively preserve portions of the 1965 Bar Plan while rejecting other portions\u201d without the approval of the county bar associations in violation of County Law \u00a7 722 (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">The City answered, asserting that its indigent defense plan is a combination plan pursuant to County Law \u00a7 722 (4), that the second addendum indicating otherwise was a misstatement, that \u201cthe criminal defense panels of private attorneys continue to be administered in the same manner [as prescribed by the 1965 Bar Plan] and [that] the role of the bar associations has not been changed or modified by the City in any way.\u201d The City cross-moved for summary judgment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b798-7\">Supreme Court granted the petition to an extent not relevant to this appeal, otherwise dismissed the petition with prejudice and granted the City\u2019s motion for summary judgment <em>(see Matter of New York County Lawyers\u2019 Assn. v Bloomberg, </em>30 Misc 3d 921 [Sup Ct, NY County 2011]). A majority of Appellate Division justices affirmed <em>(Matter of New York County Lawyers\u2019 Assn. v Bloomberg, </em>95 AD3d 92 [1st Dept 2012]), finding, as did Supreme Court, that section 722 (2) authorized the City to assign conflict cases to institutional providers without petitioners\u2019 consent, that section 722 (3) as amended did not reserve exclusive authority over the provision of conflict counsel to the county bar associations and that the City\u2019s indigent defense plan \u201cis a lawful \u2018combination\u2019 plan under County Law \u00a7 722 (4)\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 95). The majority determined that any differences between the bar plan component of the City\u2019s proposed combination plan and the 1965 Bar Plan were immaterial <em>(see id. </em>at 102). The dissenting justices would have granted the petition, finding that \u201c[t]he City\u2019s Bar Plan is markedly different from the version devised and approved by the County Bars in 1965,\u201d and that regardless of how the court \u201ccharacterize^] the changes [between the plans], the ineluctable reality is that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>\u2018Bar Plan\u2019 that has not been adopted, but instead has been rejected by the bar associations, is not \u2018a plan of a bar association\u2019 as contemplated by County Law \u00a7 722 (3)\u201d <em>{id. </em>at 111, 114).</p>\n<p id=\"b799-4\">Petitioners appeal pursuant to CPLR 5601 (a) and we now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">IL</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">\u201cIt is fundamental that a court, in interpreting a statute, should attempt to effectuate the intent of the Legislature\u201d <em>(Patrolmen\u2019s Benevolent Assn. of City of N.Y. v City of New York, </em>41 NY2d 205, 208 [1976]; <em>see also Matter of M.B., </em>6 NY3d 437, 447 [2006]). To that end, in our present interpretation of County Law \u00a7 722, we must look first to the statutory text, which is \u201cthe clearest indicator of legislative intent\u201d <em>(Majewski v Broadalbin-Perth Cent. School Dist., </em>91 NY2d 577, 583 [1998]). We are also guided in our analysis by the familiar principle \u201cthat a statute . . . must be construed as a whole and that its various sections must be considered together and with reference to each other\u201d <em>(People v Mobil Oil Corp., </em>48 NY2d 192, 199 [1979]).</p>\n<p id=\"b799-7\">Petitioners contend that County Law \u00a7 722 neither contemplates nor allows the City\u2019s assignment of conflict cases to institutional providers. According to petitioners, because section 722 addresses the provision of conflict counsel in subdivisions (3) and (4) only, conflict counsel may only be appointed by the bar associations or the judiciary pursuant to those provisions. Specifically, petitioners rely on the 2010 amendment to section 722 (3), which allowed for representation pursuant to a bar plan whereby an \u201coffice of conflict defender\u201d would provide conflict representation <em>{see </em>County Law \u00a7 722 [3] [a] [ii]). Arguing that the phrase \u201coffice of conflict defender\u201d must be read broadly to encompass institutional providers, petitioners assert that the county bar associations alone possess the authority to appoint institutional providers in conflict cases. By necessity, then, the services of institutional providers under section 722 (2), which omits reference to conflicts of interest, are limited to primary representation. We do not agree with petitioners\u2019 interpretation and conclude that the statute permits the City to assign conflict cases to institutional providers of indigent defense services.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-8\">Section 722 compels the City to \u201cplace in operation ... a plan for providing counsel to persons charged with a crime . . . who are financially unable to obtain counsel.\u201d As the United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>States Supreme Court has stated, \u201c[w]here a constitutional right to counsel exists . . . there is a correlative right to representation that is free from conflicts of interest\u201d <em>(Wood v Georgia, </em>450 US 261, 271 [1981]). Thus, it follows that the City\u2019s discretion to devise a plan for the provision of indigent criminal defense must necessarily extend to conflict representation. We cannot interpret <em>\u201ca </em>plan for providing counsel\u201d as pertaining only to primary counsel when no such limitation is evident from the general language chosen by the legislature <em>(see Majewski, </em>91 NY2d at 583; <em>Matter of Malta Town Ctr. I, Ltd. v Town of Malta Bd. of Assessment Review, </em>3 NY3d 563, 568 [2004]). Nor can we construe section 722 (2), allowing representation by a \u201cprivate legal aid bureau or society,\u201d as being similarly limited. Rather than circumscribe the City\u2019s ability to respond to conflicts of interest, we think it more likely, when construing the statute as a whole, that the legislature intended to permit the City to create a comprehensive indigent defense plan that accounts for such a frequently occurring circumstance. That authority includes a plan in which conflict cases are assigned to institutional providers as well as 18-B lawyers.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">The 2010 amendment to section 722 (3) does not alter our analysis; it simply gives municipalities yet another option for the handling of conflict cases\u2014representation by an office of conflict defender pursuant to a bar plan <em>(see </em>County Law \u00a7 722 [3] [a] [ii]).</p>\n<p id=\"b800-7\">Our reading is also fully consistent with County Law \u00a7 722 (4) . That section allows for representation of indigent defendants \u201caccording to a plan containing a combination of\u2019 section 722 (1), (2) or (3). It also allows the court to assign counsel where the City has not \u201cplaced in operation a plan conforming to\u201d subdivision (3) or a combination plan under subdivision (4), and the court \u201cis satisfied that a conflict of interest prevents the assignment of counsel pursuant to the plan in operation.\u201d In accordance with our analysis, nothing in County Law \u00a7 722 would prevent the City from implementing a plan whereby both primary and conflict counsel are furnished by various institutional providers pursuant to section 722 (2). In that case, because the plan in operation would most often provide a mechanism for resolving a conflict of interest, the occurrence of a conflict would typically not trigger the court\u2019s discretionary authority to appoint counsel unless, of course, a third conflict exists. Thus, petitioners\u2019 assertion that County Law \u00a7 722 reserves authority over the assignment of conflict representation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>exclusively to the county bar associations or, alternatively, to the judiciary is inconsistent with the statutory scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-4\">Having concluded that the City may appoint institutional providers to conflict cases independently of the bar associations and the court, we turn to the question of whether the City\u2019s proposed indigent defense plan is a valid combination plan adopted pursuant to County Law \u00a7 722 (4). Petitioners assert that the purported \u201cbar plan\u201d component of the City\u2019s proposed plan is not actually \u201ca plan of a bar association\u201d under section 722 (3) as the bar associations have not ratified, and in fact object to, the City\u2019s alterations to the 1965 Bar Plan. Of those alterations, petitioners point primarily to the departure from that portion of the 1965 Bar Plan designating conflict representation exclusively to 18-B panel attorneys. If we are to effectuate the legislative intent underlying County Law \u00a7 722, however, we cannot invalidate the City\u2019s proposed plan on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">To condition the City\u2019s authority to implement a combination plan incorporating a subdivision (3) component either on the adoption of the 1965 Bar Plan in its entirety or on the bar associations\u2019 consent to abandon that portion of the plan reserving conflict representation exclusively to 18-B attorneys would be to allow the bar associations to unilaterally block the City from adopting a plan for conflict representation that includes institutional providers. In effect, the bar associations would control the City\u2019s ability to fulfill its statutory mandate to formulate a comprehensive plan for indigent defense. We do not believe the legislature intended such a result. Rather, County Law \u00a7 722 appears to contemplate precisely what occurred here\u2014that the City, in response to needs actual or perceived, could implement a combination plan apportioning conflict representation among both institutional providers and private counsel retained pursuant to the selection method created by the 1965 Bar Plan, the 18-B panels.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">Petitioners also point to other changes, which they claim run counter to the 1965 Bar Plan and violate County Law \u00a7 722. First, petitioners assert that the City\u2019s proposed plan impermissibly transfers authority to determine whether a conflict of interest exists from the judiciary to institutional providers. We disagree. The 1965 Bar Plan stipulated that the court would appoint an 18-B attorney where it \u201cdeems the assignment of other counsel to be required in the interest of justice because of. . . a conflict of interest.\u201d However, nothing in the 1965 Bar Plan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>states that the court, rather than the institutional provider, had the exclusive authority to determine that a conflict of interest existed in the first instance. Concomitantly, New York City Executive Order No. 178 of 1965 provided that \u201c[i]n those cases where by reason of a conflict of interest or other appropriate reason . . . <em>the Legal Aid Society declines to represent any such defendant, </em>such defendant shall be represented by counsel furnished pursuant to the [1965 Bar Plan]\u201d (emphasis added). Moreover, in practice it is typically counsel who must determine whether a conflict exists as a matter of ethical obligation <em>(see </em>Rules of Professional Conduct [22 NYCRR 1200.0] rules 1.7-1.10). Thus, what petitioners contend is a major change is, in effect, no change at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">Next, they assert that in creating the OACP, the City\u2019s proposed plan usurped management authority over the 18-B panels from judicially appointed administrators and placed it under executive control. OACP, however, is \u201coverseen by two Administrators in consultation with the Presiding Justices of the First and Second Judicial Departments\u201d (43 RCNY 13-01) and, as the majority below found, \u201ctakes no authority away from the [county bar associations]\u201d <em>(Matter of New York County Lawyers\u2019 Assn., </em>95 AD3d at 102). Petitioners also assert that the City\u2019s proposed plan impermissibly replaces the county bar associations\u2019 role over the selection of 18-B panel attorneys with \u201cscreening and advisory committees\u201d designated by the First and Second Judicial Departments. While the 1965 Bar Plan did not provide for the Appellate Division\u2019s involvement in the screening of 18-B attorneys, it is undisputed that in 1980 and 1991, the county bar associations approved new sections of the Appellate Division rules that created the very screening committees for 18-B panels to which they now object <em>(see </em>22 NYCRR 612.0 <em>et seq.; </em>22 NYCRR 678.1 <em>et seq.). </em>Thus, the City\u2019s proposed plan merely codi\u00f1es a change that the bar associations ratified and that has been in practice for decades.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">Finally, we reject the argument that the City\u2019s 2010 plan violates Municipal Home Rule Law \u00a7 11 (1) (e), which prohibits the adoption of a local law that supercedes a state statute if such law affects the courts. No such situation exists here.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-7\">We thus conclude and agree with the majority below that the City\u2019s 2010 plan for indigent defense constitutes a valid combination plan under County Law \u00a7 722 (4). Construed as a whole, section 722 affords the City the flexibility to appoint institutional providers to represent indigent defendants where a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>conflict of interest precludes representation by the primary provider. As such, the City, in the exercise of its discretion, was not required to adopt that portion of the 1965 Bar Plan reserving conflict cases exclusively to 18-B panel attorneys in order to implement a combination plan incorporating \u201ca plan of a bar association\u201d pursuant to County Law \u00a7 722 (3). Importantly, the 18-B panels created by the 1965 Bar Plan remain in place and are expressly preserved by the executive order governing the City\u2019s 2010 plan. The City\u2019s plan thus allows for the defense of indigent criminal defendants by the Legal Aid Society, other institutional providers and the private bar, as a combination plan that serves the needs of the clients but also recognizes fiscal realities to be borne by the City.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-4\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, without costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b794-11\">.

Previously, it read, in relevant part, \u201ccounsel furnished pursuant to a plan of a bar association . . . whereby the services of private counsel are rotated and coordinated by an administrator\u201d <em>(see </em>L 1965, ch 878, \u00a7 1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b796-10\">.

The salient and transformative difference between the new and old plans is that under the new plan institutional providers may be called upon to provide either primary or conflict representation, whereas under the old plan, both as formulated by the bar associations and implemented by the City, representation in conflict cases was to be handled exclusively by panel attorneys. The new plan reduces, and indeed will likely marginalize the participation of panel attorneys, dramatically shifting from them to institutional providers retained through competitive bidding, the conflict defense function.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>The legal issue immediately posed by this shift is not whether it is within the City\u2019s power to accomplish, but whether it is permissibly accomplished by means of the particular section 722 (4) combination plan the City has evidently settled upon. That plan, like its forerunner, purports to rely in essential part upon \u201cRepresentation by counsel furnished pursuant to ... a plan of a bar association\u201d (County Law \u00a7 722 [3] [a]). Indeed, the new plan purports to rely on the very same bar association plan used in connection with the now repeatedly repealed 1965 plan <em>(see </em>majority op at 718-719). However, no bar association has agreed to the use of the 1965 plan in the dramatically different context that would be created by the expanded subdivision (2) component of the City\u2019s new plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">As the majority acknowledges, and as is in any case clear from the record, it was an express element of the 1965 bar association plan and of the consequent City plan adopted in the same year that panel attorneys would be assigned all of the matters in which the then sole private institutional provider,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the Legal Aid Society, was conflicted. Stripped of that critical allocation of responsibility, the bar association plan is that in name only; it is, in its starkly pared aspect, simply a plan of the City attributable to a bar association only by highhanded assertion. The 1965 bar association plan was not designed like a bit of LEGO for use in a range of interchangeable settings at the City\u2019s option. Rather, it contemplated a particular relation between institutional and panel providers with specific, well-defined functions assigned each. Plainly, that relation has been fundamentally altered in the City\u2019s new plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">Inasmuch, then, as the City\u2019s presently proposed combination plan lacks an essential combinative element, namely \u201ca plan of a bar association,\u201d it is not a valid County Law \u00a7 722 (4) plan and that is where the analysis logically must find its point of repose. The majority, however, would avoid this conclusion, not because it is sensible to suppose that the bare retention of the panels is or may be deemed \u201cpursuant to . . . a plan of a bar association,\u201d but because it finds unacceptable the notion that bar associations may, by withholding consent to a City plan for the provision of panel attorneys, \u201cunilaterally block the City from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>adopting a plan for conflict representation that includes institutional providers\u201d (majority op at 723). But, of course, if one accepts the majority\u2019s conclusion that conflict representation may be provided by institutional providers under a simple section 722 (2) plan, it cannot be that the bar associations have the veto power the majority ascribes to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-4\">While, under the statute, the absence of <em>\u201ca </em>plan of a bar association\u201d operates to prevent the City from devising a subdivision (3) plan or a subdivision (4) plan depending on a subdivision (3) component, these limitations manifestly do not prevent the City from fulfilling its statutory mandate to formulate a comprehensive plan for indigent defense. And, given the majority\u2019s understanding of what a subdivision (2) plan may include, it is clear that the City may adopt a plan that will meet its dominant motivating objective of shifting conflict representation to institutional providers. Indeed, the present plan\u2019s subdivision (2) component, standing alone, would appear independently to be statutorily compliant as a subdivision (2) plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">Although the City may prefer a combination plan involving the retention of panel attorneys so as to assure that there will be no situation in which a court will appoint conflict counsel pursuant to section 722 (4),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> that is not a preference that the statute may be read to accommodate, unless there is in fact a bona fide subdivision (3) bar association plan. Certainly, the existence of the preference does not justify disregarding the statutory condition of its gratification.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">The City doubtless has considerable discretion to fashion an indigent defense plan, but like any other locality charged with the obligation of devising such a plan, its discretion is limited by County Law \u00a7 722; it does not have laissez-faire to construct a plan except from the elements the statute makes available <em>(see e.g. Goehler v Cortland County, </em>70 AD3d 57 [3d Dept 2009] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>[declaring the County\u2019s creation of an office of conflict attorney invalid because the newly created office did not correspond to any statutorily sanctioned option]).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Here, because the City\u2019s combination plan relies upon an element that does not exist, it does not conform to the statute and is violative of Municipal Home Rule Law \u00a7 11 (1) (e). This does not mean that the City should be indefinitely stymied in implementing an indigent defense plan, only that it cannot while complying with the statute implement the present plan with its subdivision (3) piece. What would remain after dispensing with that defective element would, I believe, be a valid subdivision (2) plan on the basis of which the City could proceed. This would, as noted, entail judicial appointment of counsel in conflict situations where institutional conflict defenders were unavailable, but that is what the statute requires where there is no plan of a bar association for the provision of private counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">The City may have very sound policy reasons for the change it proposes, but as it goes about altering, perhaps irretrievably, the network of indigent defense service providers that has been in place for some 47 years, it would seem more than ordinarily important to insist upon compliance with the limitations contained in County Law \u00a7 722, among them that bar association consent be obtained as a condition of a City plan purporting to rely on \u201ca plan of a bar association.\u201d This is not simply a question of logic and manners. The purpose of the statute is to assure that there will be quality representation for indigent defendants pursuant to the mandate of <em>Gideon v Wainwright </em>(372 US 335 [1963]), and toward that end the legislature has, quite reasonably, required localities to act cooperatively with the bar associations whose members are to be drawn upon for their professional services. If the panels are to be retained and usefully administered as a representational resource, it would be prudent and natural that it would be according to a sustaining plan devised not only by the City but also in part by legal professionals concerned first and foremost with the delivery of quality representation. That is, in any event, what the statute requires and what municipal discretion therefore is not appropriately invoked to excuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>Judges Graffeo, Read and Jones concur with Judge Ciparick; Chief Judge Lippman dissents in a separate opinion in which Judges Smith and Pigott concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-4\">Order affirmed, wdthout costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b804-7\">. While it is true that there have since 1996 been institutional defenders other than Legal Aid integrated as service providers within the City plan, those providers merely enlarged the pool of primary defenders; they were not used to supplant the panel attorneys from their agreed upon role as conflict defenders under the original City combination plan.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b805-7\">.
