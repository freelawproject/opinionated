We hold that the court lacks this authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">L</p>\n<p id=\"b504-9\">Hailey ZZ., born in late 2007, initially resided with her birth mother and father and an older half-sister, a child of Hailey\u2019s mother and a different father. Father was sentenced to 5 to 15 years in prison in early 2008, when Hailey was three months old, and has apparently remained incarcerated ever since. On November 5, 2008, the Tompkins County Department of Social Services (DSS), effecting a removal under section 1024 of the Family Court Act, took Hailey and her half-sister away from their mother. The girls were placed in DSS\u2019s custody to reside with certified foster parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-10\">On March 26, 2010, DSS filed petitions against both parents, seeking orders adjudicating Hailey to be permanently neglected, terminating parental rights and committing her guardianship and custody to DSS <em>(see </em>Social Services Law \u00a7 384-b; Family Ct Act \u00a7 614). On July 23, 2010, Hailey\u2019s mother surrendered her parental rights and signed a postadoption visitation agreement <em>(see </em>Social Services Law \u00a7 383-c). DSS withdrew its petition against mother, and proceeded with the fact-finding hearing against father (Family Ct Act \u00a7 622).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>In a decision and order entered on August 12, 2010, Supreme Court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> first determined that DSS had made the requisite diligent efforts to encourage and strengthen the parental relationship by maintaining regular contact with father after Hailey\u2019s placement in November 2008, insuring monthly visitations, requesting the necessary information to plan for the child\u2019s care and investigating the individuals whom father suggested to be Hailey\u2019s caretakers. He noted that DSS\u2019s diligent efforts \u201covercame as many barriers\u201d posed by father\u2019s incarceration \u201cas possible to assist [him] in reuniting with the child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">Next, Supreme Court determined that father had failed to plan for Hailey\u2019s future for more than one year after she came under DSS\u2019s care. The judge acknowledged that father had maintained contact with Hailey and DSS and had participated in various prison programs, but opined that this was insufficient. He observed that father was not likely to be released from prison until June 2011 at the earliest, and more likely later, possibly not until 2018; that once released, father would \u201chave to obtain suitable housing and address some parenting issues prior to gaining placement of the child\u201d; and that Hailey had already been in foster care for 20 months and \u201cneed[ed] to achieve permanency.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">As a result of these circumstances, Supreme Court concluded that father\u2019s \u201conly alternative [was] to come up with a plan for the care of [Hailey] until he [was] able to resume custody.\u201d The judge concluded that father failed to do this because the family members or others whom he proposed to care for Hailey were uniformly unsuitable: his father had a \u201clengthy history\u201d with DSS, and one sister had such a \u201chistory\u201d as well; father \u201cadmitted\u201d that neither would be an \u201cappropriate\u201d custodian; the other sister was fired from her job as a health aide after being accused of elder abuse;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and his girlfriend of seven months and the distant relatives whom he identified barely knew Hailey, and \u201cthere [was] no indication whatsoever that they [were] interested or appropriate.\u201d Accordingly, Supreme Court adjudicated Hailey to be permanently neglected and ordered the requisite dispositional hearing (see Family Ct Act \u00a7\u00a7 623, 625).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>In a decision and order entered on October 29, 2010 after the dispositional hearing, Supreme Court considered whether it was in Hailey\u2019s best interests to terminate father\u2019s parental rights and commit guardianship to DSS, or, alternatively, suspend judgment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The judge remarked that father had been in prison \u201cduring the entire period\u201d of Hailey\u2019s foster care\u2014two thirds of her life\u2014and that once released, would still need to obtain stable housing and \u201cpossibly engage in other services [ ] before the child could be returned to his care.\u201d He concluded that it was in Hailey\u2019s best interests to terminate father\u2019s parental rights and free her for adoption so as to achieve permanency.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">Additionally, Supreme Court denied father\u2019s request for <em>continuing </em>visitation with Hailey. Father cited several Fourth Department cases to support the availability of this option. The judge noted, though, that Third Department precedent did not allow for a court to mandate continuing contact between a parent and child after parental rights had been terminated pursuant to Social Services Law \u00a7 384-b. He added that such contact would, in any event, not be in Hailey\u2019s best interests as there was no evidence of any emotional or lasting connection between Hailey and father; indeed, they had spent only about 72 hours together in two years\u2019 time, or the equivalent of 3 out of 730 days. Nor was there evidence to show whether Hailey\u2019s potential adoptive parents \u201cwould be receptive to future visitation for [father],\u201d or, if this adoption fell through, whether such a requirement \u201cwould discourage other potential adoptive parents.\u201d In sum, Supreme Court ruled it was in Hailey\u2019s best interests to terminate father\u2019s parental rights, without posttermination visitation \u201ceven if the Third Department allowed [it],\u201d rather than suspend judgment. Father appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">The Appellate Division affirmed, concluding that the evidence supported Supreme Court\u2019s finding that DSS \u201cmade the requisite diligent efforts\u201d; and there was \u201cno basis to disturb the [judge\u2019s] conclusion that [father] failed to plan for the child\u2019s future\u201d (85 AD3d 1265, 1266 [3d Dept 2011]). The Appellate Division also determined that the record supported Supreme Court\u2019s</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>\u201cfinding that, instead of remaining in foster care on a long-term basis while [father] remains incarcerated, it is in the child\u2019s best interests to be freed for adoption by the foster parents, who have expressed a willingness to adopt [Hailey] and her half sister, to whom she is closely bonded\u201d <em>{id. </em>at 1266-1267).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"A53\">Further, \u201cthe request for posttermination visitation was properly denied as unavailable in a contested termination proceeding\u201d <em>{id. </em>at 1267). We granted father leave to appeal (17 NY3d 709 [2011]), and now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">IL</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">An authorized agency that brings a proceeding to terminate parental rights based upon permanent neglect bears the burden of establishing that it has made \u201cdiligent efforts to encourage and strengthen the parental relationship\u201d (Social Services Law \u00a7 384-b [7] [a]; <em>see Matter of Sheila G., </em>61 NY2d 368, 380-381 [1984]). \u201cThose efforts must include counseling, making suitable arrangements for visitation, providing assistance to the parents to resolve or ameliorate the problems preventing discharge of the child to their care and advising the parent at appropriate intervals of the child\u2019s progress and development\u201d <em>(Matter of Star Leslie W., </em>63 NY2d 136, 142 [1984]; <em>see </em>Social Services Law \u00a7 384-b [7] [f]).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">Once diligent efforts have been established, the agency must prove that the parent has permanently neglected the child, as defined in Social Services Law \u00a7 384-b (7) (a), by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>Further, at the ensuing dispositional hearing the court must consider only the best interests of the child involved, which is essentially a factual determination <em>(see Matter of Star Leslie W., </em>63 NY2d at 147-148).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>\u201cfail[ing] for a period of [more than one year] following the date such child came into the care of an authorized agency substantially and continuously or repeatedly to maintain contact with or plan for the future of the child, although physically and financially able to do so, notwithstanding the agency\u2019s diligent efforts to encourage and strengthen the parental relationship when such efforts will not be detrimental to the best interests of the child.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>Father argues that DSS did not prove by the required clear and convincing evidence that it exercised diligent efforts, or that he failed to plan for Hailey. Thus, he contends, Supreme Court should have dismissed the permanent neglect petition. But DSS established that it arranged visitation for father, communicated with him regarding service plans and Hailey\u2019s progress and investigated various relatives proposed as resources for placement. And as we emphasized in <em>Matter of Gregory B. </em>(74 NY2d 77, 89-90 [1989]), while the Legislature in Social Services Law \u00a7 384-b (7)</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-6\">\u201cacknowledged the \u2018special circumstances\u2019 of an incarcerated parent . . . [t]his does not mean . . . that the Legislature intended to approve a plan of indefinite foster care for the child of an incarcerated parent who is serving a lengthy prison term and who cannot provide the child with an alternative living arrangement. Although the statutory scheme favors keeping a child with the natural parent where practicable and stresses the importance of exercising diligent efforts to foster and maintain the cohesiveness of the family unit, permanence in a child\u2019s life also has been given a priority, because the Legislature has determined that a normal family life in a <em>permanent </em>home offers the best opportunity for a child to develop and thrive. Thus, ... a primary purpose of the statute is to provide a fair and timely basis to free a child for adoption and that [w]hen it is clear that natural parents cannot offer a normal home for a child, and continued foster care is not an appropriate plan, the statute directs that a permanent home be sought\u201d (internal quotation marks and citation omitted; <em>see also Matter of Michael B., </em>80 NY2d 299, 310 [1992] [\u201cExtended foster care is not in the child\u2019s best interest, because it deprives a child of a permanent, nurturing family relationship\u201d]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">We may review findings of fact, reached by the trial court under the proper evidentiary standard and affirmed by the Appellate Division, only to determine whether they enjoy support in the record <em>(Matter of Star Leslie W., </em>63 NY2d at 147). Here, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>the evidence backs up Supreme Court\u2019s affirmed findings that DSS exercised diligent efforts, and that for a period of more than a year father failed to plan for Hailey\u2019s future in a \u201crealistic and feasible\u201d way <em>(see </em>Social Services Law \u00a7 384-b [7] [c]). As amicus curiae Monroe County Attorney put it, \u201c[effectively, [father\u2019s] plan for [Hailey] was to let the county care for her in foster care until he got out of prison . . . , at which time he would start the hard work to get the child back\u201d <em>(see Matter of Gregory B., </em>74 NY2d at 89 [statutory reforms precluding termination of parental rights based solely on the fact of incarceration \u201cwere in no way intended to excuse incarcerated parents from the requirement that they plan for their child\u2019s future\u201d]). In short, the record supports the judge\u2019s determinations adjudicating Hailey a permanently neglected child and terminating father\u2019s parental rights, thus freeing Hailey for adoption.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">IIL</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">In the event we decide that his parental rights were properly terminated\u2014as we have\u2014father contends that the lower courts wrongly decided that the hearing court lacked authority to grant him posttermination contact with Hailey. He therefore asks us to remit this matter to the Appellate Division for its review of Supreme Court\u2019s alternative ruling that posttermination visitation would not be in Hailey\u2019s best interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">The Fourth Department has held that Family Court is authorized to award posttermination contact where parental rights have been terminated pursuant to Social Services Law \u00a7 384-b. In <em>Matter of Kahlil S. </em>(35 AD3d 1164 [4th Dept 2006], <em>lv dismissed </em>8 NY3d 977 [2007]), the court upheld termination of the mother\u2019s parental rights with respect to her two children, Kahlil S. and Terrell Z., on the ground that she presently and for the foreseeable future was unable, by reason of mental illness, to provide proper and adequate care for them. In this connection, however, the Fourth Department declared that where</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-8\">\u201cparental rights are terminated after a finding that the parent is unable by reason of mental illness or mental retardation to provide proper and adequate care for his or her child or after a finding of permanent neglect <em>(see </em>Social Services Law \u00a7 384-b [4] [c], [d]), Family Court may, in those cases in which the court deems it appropriate, exercise its discretion in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>determining whether some form of posttermination contact with the biological parent is in the best interests of the child\u201d <em>{id. </em>at 1165).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">In so holding, the court expressly disavowed its contrary decisions in <em>Matter of Kenneth D. </em>(32 AD3d 1237 [4th Dept 2006]) and <em>Matter of Livingston County Dept. of Social Servs. v Tracy T. </em>(16 AD3d 1133 [4th Dept 2005]).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">Thus, the Fourth Department in <em>Matter of Kahlil S. </em>remitted the matter to Family Court for a hearing as to whether posttermination contact with their mother was in the children\u2019s best interests (35 AD3d at 1165-1166). The court observed that in making this determination, Family Court was to \u201cconsider, inter alia, the ages of the children, the bond between [the mother] and the children, and the likelihood that the children will be adopted\u201d <em>{id. </em>at 1166).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Section 634 of the Family Court Act is the only statute cited by the Fourth Department to support its decision. This provision states merely that an order entered after a dispositional hearing committing a child\u2019s guardianship and custody to an authorized agency may be made \u201con such conditions, if any, as [the court] deems proper.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">Subsequent to <em>Matter of Kahlil S., </em>the Fourth Department has handed down decisions reiterating or presuming that Family Court possesses authority to provide for posttermination contact, and must, upon a parent\u2019s request, decide whether such a continuing relationship is in the child\u2019s best interests <em>(see e.g. Matter of Thomas B., </em>35 AD3d 1289 [4th Dept 2006], <em>lv dismissed </em>8 NY3d 936 [2007] [remitting for best interests determination where parental rights were terminated by reason of mental illness]; <em>Matter of Bert M., </em>50 AD3d 1509 [4th Dept 2008], <em>lv denied </em>11 NY3d 704 [2008] [same, where parental rights were terminated after a finding of permanent neglect]; <em>Matter of Josh M., </em>61 AD3d 1366 [4th Dept 2009] [same, where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>parental rights were terminated on the basis of mental retardation]; <em>Matter of Diana M.T., </em>57 AD3d 1492 [4th Dept 2008], <em>lv denied </em>12 NY3d 708 [2009] [affirming Family Court\u2019s denial of request for posttermination visitation made by father whose parental rights were terminated on the ground of mental illness]; <em>Matter of Samantha K., </em>59 AD3d 1012 [4th Dept 2009] [Family Court\u2019s order terminating father\u2019s parental rights upon a finding of permanent neglect, while allowing him to retain visitation rights, was in the child\u2019s best interests]; <em>Matter of Seth M., </em>66 AD3d 1448 [4th Dept 2009], <em>lv dismissed </em>13 NY3d 922 [2010] [concluding that Family Court erred by deciding in permanent neglect proceeding that it lacked authority to permit posttermination visitation, and remitting for best interests determination]; <em>Matter of Lashawnda G.

That court has endorsed the availability of posttermination contact where parental rights were terminated on the ground of mental retardation <em>(see Matter of Corinthian Marie S., </em>297 AD2d 382 [2d Dept 2002])<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> or mental illness <em>(see Matter of Selena C.

There, the First Department took the position that \u201c[w]hile postadoption contact is permitted in the context of a surrender agreement pursuant to Social Services Law \u00a7 383-c, it remains that \u2018open adoption\u2019 is not a dispositional option in the context of a termination proceeding pursuant to Social Services Law \u00a7 384-b\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 162, citing <em>Matter of Gregory B., supra, </em>and <em>Matter of Jacob, </em>86 NY2d 651 [1995]). But the Second Department recently relied on <em>Matter of Kahlil S. </em>and its Fourth Department progeny in a case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>where a mother\u2019s parental rights with respect to two children, one of whom was severely disabled and institutionalized, were terminated on the ground of permanent neglect <em>(Matter of Kyshawn F., </em>95 AD3d 883 [2d Dept 2012]). The court modified the order of disposition with respect to the disabled child so as to provide for posttermination visitation, and remitted the matter for Family Court to determine what frequency of visits was in the child\u2019s best interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\"><em>Matter of April S. </em>(307 AD2d 204 [1st Dept 2003], <em>lv denied </em>1 NY3d 504 [2003]) is the principal case in the First Department to discuss posttermination contact. There, Family Court entered dispositional orders directing postadoption visitation between the mother and her two children after terminating the mother\u2019s parental rights upon a finding of permanent neglect. The First Department vacated this provision of the orders, citing its decision in <em>Matter of Cheyanne M. </em>and our decision in <em>Matter of Gregory B. </em>In discussing <em>Matter of Gregory B., </em>the court emphasized our view \u201cthat it [was] up to the Legislature to determine and direct which circumstances, if any, are amenable to the \u2018open adoption\u2019 process\u201d; and added that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-6\">\u201cthe Legislature did so in 1990, when it enacted Social Services Law \u00a7 383-c, for the first time providing for procedures by which a parent may surrender a child conditioned upon the retention of certain rights of contact or visitation. From the fact that no alteration was made to section 384-b, it must be presumed that there was no legislative intent to extend the concept of open adoption to adoptions following parental terminations pursuant to section 384-b\u201d (307 AD2d at 204).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">The First Department distinguished the Second Department\u2019s decision in <em>Matter of Corinthian Marie S. </em>on the basis of \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 205; <em>see </em>n 7, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">The Third Department appears to have grappled with the issue on this appeal as early as 1994 in <em>Matter of Rita VV. </em>(209 AD2d 866 [3d Dept 1994], <em>lv denied </em>85 NY2d 811 [1995]). There, Family Court\u2019s dispositional order in the permanent neglect proceeding conditioned adoption upon visitation with the child\u2019s biological mother and maternal grandparents. The court held this to be error, commenting that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-9\">\u201cSocial Services Law \u00a7 384-b contemplates an adversarial proceeding. It does not contain a provision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>that upon a determination that parental rights should be terminated a court can require or permit contact by and between a biological parent and a child who has been adopted. While Family Court was correct that the Legislature has amended Social Services Law \u00a7 383-c to allow a parent to condition a <em>voluntary surrender </em>for adoption upon . . . contact with the child or information concerning the child, the proceeding herein did not involve such a voluntary surrender. Accordingly, the provisions of Social Services Law \u00a7 383-c are wholly inapplicable and, therefore, Family Court was without authority in this <em>adversarial proceeding </em>to require such continued contact as a condition of adoption\u201d <em>{id. </em>at 868-869).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">In a string of subsequent cases, the Third Department has steadfastly adhered to the position that Family Court may not direct posttermination contact in a case where parental rights have been ended pursuant to Social Services Law \u00a7 384-b <em>(see e.g. Matter of Shane J. v Cortland County Dept. of Social Servs., </em>305 AD2d 751 [3d Dept 2003] [\u201cIt is well settled that the termination of . . . parental rights necessarily include(s) the denial of \u2018the rights ever to visit, communicate with, or regain custody of the child\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Santosky v </em>Kramer, 455 US 745, 749 [1982])]; <em>Matter of Jessi W., </em>20 AD3d 620 [3d Dept 2005] [Family Court lacked authority to permit the visitation requested by the father once his parental rights were terminated]; <em>Matter of William W., </em>23 AD3d 735 [3d Dept 2005] [rejecting claim of the mother, whose parental rights were terminated on the ground of mental retardation, that Family Court should have held a dispositional hearing to examine options for her to maintain continued contact with her children]; <em>Mattter of Labron P., </em>23 AD3d 943, 945 [3d Dept 2005] [\u201cFamily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>Court correctly surmised that it lacked the authority to include ... a provision (granting postadoption visitation) in the dispositional order\u201d entered in the permanent neglect proceeding]; <em>Matter of John KK., </em>34 AD3d 1050, 1052 [3d Dept 2006] [\u201cAlthough a court may order postadoption visitation when the termination results from a voluntary surrender under Social Services Law \u00a7 383-c, an adversarial proceeding pursuant to Social Services Law \u00a7 384-b does not afford such option\u201d]; <em>Matter of James X., </em>37 AD3d 1003, 1007 [3d Dept 2007] [\u201c(I)t is axiomatic that when parental rights are terminated pursuant to an adversarial proceeding that results in a finding of permanent neglect, the court lacks authority to permit visitation to a respondent\u201d]; <em>Matter of Melissa DD., </em>45 AD3d 1219, 1221-1222 [3d Dept 2007], <em>lv denied </em>10 NY3d 701 [2008] [\u201cBecause (the mother\u2019s) parental rights were terminated in an adversarial proceeding, not as a result of a voluntary surrender, Family Court had no authority to permit posttermination visitation between her and the children\u201d]; <em>Matter of Raine QQ., </em>51 AD3d 1106 [3d Dept 2008], <em>lv denied </em>10 NY3d 717 [2008] [same]).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">In <em>Matter of Xionia VV. (Amos VV.) </em>(78 AD3d 1452, 1453 [3d Dept 2010]), the Third Department rejected the father\u2019s \u201csole contention on appeal, relying upon authority from the Appellate Division, Fourth Department\u201d\u2014in particular, <em>Matter of Kahlil </em>S.\u2014\u201cthat Family Court should have awarded him posttermination visitation with the child.\u201d The court reiterated its view that Family Court does not possess authority to grant such a request in an adversarial proceeding pursuant to Social Services Law \u00a7 384-b.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">Relying on section 634 of the Family Court Act, father argues that if the disposition of a petition brought pursuant to Social Services Law \u00a7 384-b</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-8\">\u201cis to be termination of parental rights, then, the Family Court Act directs[ ] that termination is to be \u2018on such conditions, if any, as [the court] deems proper,\u2019 and what conditions, if any, to impose is to be decided solely on the basis of the child\u2019s best interests. Therefore, under the Family Court Act, if the child\u2019s best interests would be served by termination of parental rights on condition that the biological parent retain some right of contact with the child, then Family Court must so order.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b515-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>The flaw here is that father presupposes that this particular kind of condition\u2014one preserving contact between parent and child notwithstanding the termination of parental rights\u2014is a condition the court is empowered to mandate. There is concededly no statutory support for such authority outside the context of a voluntary surrender pursuant to Social Services Law \u00a7 383-c, as the First Department recognized in <em>Matter of April S. </em>and the Third Department has repeatedly emphasized. Father seeks to overcome this obstacle by arguing, in effect, that Family Court possesses an inherent discretionary authority to provide for posttermination contact in a dispositional order when determined to be in the child\u2019s best interests. But this argument runs counter to our decision in <em>Matter of Gregory B.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">In that case, we also decided an appeal taken from the judgment of Family Court in <em>Matter of Delores B., </em>which terminated the father\u2019s parental rights on the ground of permanent neglect. That appeal brought up for review the Appellate Division\u2019s prior order reversing the Family Court\u2019s order dismissing the petition, and remanding the matter for a dispositional hearing (141 AD2d 100 [1st Dept 1988]). As we explained in <em>Matter of Gregory B., </em>in <em>Matter of Delores B. </em>two of the Justices in the Appellate Division\u2014one of whom concurred in part and dissented in part; the other of whom dissented\u2014voiced sympathy for the notion of coupling termination of parental rights with some provision for continuation of contacts between the father and his children, Delores B. and her brother, Willie John B., also adjudicated to be permanently neglected (74 NY2d at 85-86).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">While acknowledging the reasons \u201cprompting some to advocate \u2018open\u2019 adoptions in which the court supplements an order of adoption with a provision directing that the adopted child have continuing contacts and visitation with members of his or her biological family,\u201d we \u201cexpressed] no opinion as to whether such contacts generally would be helpful and appropriate once parental rights have been terminated and the child has been adopted into a new family or whether a court should have the discretionary authority to order such contacts\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 90-91). Further, we observed, \u201cthe \u2018open\u2019 adoption concept would appear to be inconsistent with this State\u2019s view as expressed by the Legislature that adoption relieves the biological parent \u2018of all parental duties toward and of all responsibilities for\u2019 the adoptive child over whom the parent \u2018shall have no rights\u2019 \u201d <em>(id. </em>at 91, quoting Domestic Relations Law \u00a7 117 [1] [a], and citing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number><em>Matter of Best, </em>66 NY2d 151 [1985]). We then closed our discussion of this issue as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-5\">\u201cAlthough adoptive parents are free, at their election, to permit contacts between the adopted child and the child\u2019s biological parent, to judicially require such contacts arguably may be seen as threatening the integrity of the adoptive family unit. In any event, \u2018open\u2019 adoptions are not presently authorized. If they are to be established, it is the Legislature that more appropriately should be called upon to balance the critical social policy choices and the delicate issues of family relations involved in such a determination\u201d (74 NY2d at 91).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">Father counters that in <em>Matter of Jacob </em>we recognized that the Legislature, by authorizing open adoptions in Social Services Law \u00a7 383-c without amending Domestic Relations Law \u00a7 117, \u201cimplicitly rejected Matter of Gregory B.\u2019s reading of [the latter statute] to invariably preclude any continued right of contact following termination of parental rights.\u201d But again, father\u2019s argument begs the question. As we stated in <em>Matter of Jacob, </em>\u201c[o]ne conclusion that can be drawn\u201d from the Legislature\u2019s enactment of section 383-c \u201cis that section 117 does not invariably require termination in the situation where the biological parent, having consented to the adoption, has agreed to retain parental rights and to raise the child together with the second parent\u201d (86 NY2d at 667). In other words, section 117 did not \u201crequire termination\u201d in <em>Matter of Jacob </em>because the Legislature acted to provide otherwise in the case of a voluntary surrender. And the Legislature, the entity best suited \u201cto balance the critical social policy choices and the delicate issues of family relations involved\u201d in such matters <em>(Matter of Gregory B., </em>74 NY2d at 91), has not sanctioned judicial imposition of posttermination contact where parental rights are terminated after a contested proceeding. Absent legislative warrant, Family Court is not authorized to include any such condition in a dispositional order made pursuant to Social Services Law \u00a7 384-b.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>Finally, we have examined father\u2019s remaining claims and consider them to be without merit. Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, without costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b505-7\">. This matter was transferred from Family Court to Supreme Court and referred to Supreme Court\u2019s Integrated Domestic Violence Part, where it was handled by a Family Court judge designated an acting Supreme Court justice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b505-8\">.

A suspended judgment is intended to provide an opportunity\u2014in effect, a second chance\u2014for reunification of parent and child.

At the fact-finding hearing, father testified that although he did not want to separate Hailey from her half-sister, he nonetheless \u201c[did not] think that [his] rights should be taken away from [him] because they want to be placed together.\u201d Similarly, father acknowledged that his desire to retain parental rights, or at least not to surrender them without far more visitation than DSS proposed, was \u201cabout [his] feelings\u201d since Hailey was \u201cthe only kid [he had]\u201d and he was \u201cgoing to be in jail probably the next year or so.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b510-8\">. In both cases, parental rights were terminated on the ground of permanent neglect and the Fourth Department opined that Family Court lacked authority to provide for visitation. The court specifically noted in <em>Matter of Livingston County Dept, of Social Servs. </em>that \u201c[visitation is authorized only where parental rights are surrendered voluntarily\u201d (16 AD3d at 1133).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b510-9\">. At the hearing held upon remittal, Family Court granted the mother \u201creasonable\u201d posttermination visitation with Terrell Z., but concluded that posttermination contact with Kahlil S. would interfere with his pending adoption and was therefore not in his best interests. The Appellate Division affirmed (see <em>Matter of Kahlil S., </em>60 AD3d 1450 [4th Dept 2009], <em>lv dismissed </em>12 NY3d 898 [2009]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b511-7\">. Notably, in <em>Matter of Corinthian Marie S., </em>the children\u2019s law guardian and prospective adoptive parents <em>consented </em>to the posttermination contact over the objection of the Dutchess County Department of Social Services.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b513-6\">. Father complains that \u201c[u]nder the rule of the Third Department, only a parent who exercises his due process right to a hearing . . . risks losing the right to post-termination contact\u201d while \u201c[a] parent who surrenders his parental rights without a hearing . . . may do so on condition that he retain some right to post-termination visitation.\u201d He thus likens sections 383-c and 384-b in this regard to the provisions struck down on due process grounds in <em>Matter of Hynes v Tomei </em>(92 NY2d 613 [1998]). But <em>Hynes </em>involved an increased punishment for failure to plead guilty in a criminal case. Here, the Legislature is not increasing punishment based on the exercise of a constitutional right, but rather is making a policy judgment that a particular kind of conditional relief\u2014i.e., posttermination contact\u2014is likely to be beneficial to children in consensual but not contested proceedings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b516-8\">. The dissenting judge \u201cwould prefer to sanction, rather than restrict, the hearing court\u2019s exercise of discretion, particularly in the area of family law where flexibility in judicial decision-making is a virtue of the highest order\u201d (dissenting op at 445). Putting aside that the Legislature has not chosen to vest Family Court with this particular discretion and flexibility, the County Attorneys from Monroe, Saratoga and Washington Counties, in their respective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>amicus briefs, point out the practical problems with leaving the decision on posttermination contact up to a judge. Specifically, the uncertainty and the potential for delay and added expense inhering in this approach discourage, and may derail, the adoption of neglected children, thus reducing their opportunities to be placed in a permanent home, or, if they are adopted, threatening the integrity of the new family unit. As the Monroe County Attorney explains, many prospective adoptive parents are reluctant or unwilling to entertain the prospect of facilitating contact between a child and a biological parent sufficiently troubled to have lost parental rights. On the flip side of the coin, adoptive parents who do not object to posttermination contact are going to permit this to happen without the necessity of a court order. Surely, adoptive parents are the best arbiters of whether continued contact with the birth parent is in a child\u2019s best interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-9\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>\n<em>(n. confd)</em>\n</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b517-5\">Pigott, J.

When the attention of the Department of Social Services (DSS) was drawn to Hailey\u2019s situation, DSS removed her from her mother\u2019s custody pursuant to Family Court Act \u00a7 1024, and sent her to live with nonrelative foster parents, initially with a woman whom I shall call \u201cN.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>Because Hailey\u2019s father knew N, and knew she would take good care of Hailey and allow him to see his daughter, Hailey\u2019s father asked K to drop her custody application. N and K worked together to continue the father-daughter bond while Hailey\u2019s father was in prison. With the cooperation of N, K drove Hailey to visit her father every month, for about three or four hours at a time. The two would hug each other; Hailey\u2019s father, whom she called \u201cDaddy,\u201d read her books; and they played with puzzles. DSS observed no ill effects whatsoever from these visits.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">While in prison, Hailey\u2019s father took parenting classes and completed his General Educational Development credential. Unfortunately, while DSS told Hailey\u2019s father that he would need to \u201cplan for\u201d Hailey\u2019s future, he was given little hint and no specific information about how he might fulfil this requirement while incarcerated.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">DSS asked Hailey\u2019s father to provide a list of people with whom Hailey might live until he was released. He proposed his father, his sister K, and another sister\u2014whom I shall call \u201cE\u201d DSS\u2019s family assessment and service plan reports that, in addition to K, who had filed for custody, P called DSS and said she would be willing to care for Hailey and her half-sister.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">Correspondence between DSS and Hailey\u2019s father in early 2010 gives no hint of the urgency of his finding a suitable relative (or a friend who was a certified foster parent) who could file for custody or guardianship of Hailey and take care of her until he was able to <em>(see generally </em>Family Ct Act \u00a7 1017), in that way demonstrating his planning for the future of the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">A letter from Hailey\u2019s DSS caseworker to her father, dated January 26, 2010, which contains no specifics whatsoever, is accompanied by a \u201ccurrent service plan\u201d that, in listing problems and concerns, merely notes that Hailey\u2019s father \u201cneeds to assist in the permanency plans for his daughter Hailey.\u201d This was something Hailey\u2019s father thought he was doing by providing relatives\u2019 names and contact information and participating in programs provided by the Department of Correctional Services.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-9\">Then, a letter from a different DSS caseworker, dated March 16, 2010, warned Hailey\u2019s father that a hearing was imminent at which DSS would seek to free Hailey for adoption (by a non-relative), but gave him no information about how he could take concrete steps towards the return of his child. While the caseworker asked Hailey\u2019s father to suggest someone \u201cas a long term home for Hailey\u201d and added that the person would have to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>clear certain background checks, she failed to explain whether, or why, the people Hailey\u2019s father had already proposed were considered unsuitable, and she neglected to specify any relationship or credentials required of the person able to provide the \u201clong term home.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">Ten days later, on March 26, 2010, DSS filed petitions against Hailey\u2019s mother and father, seeking orders adjudicating Hailey to be a permanently neglected child, terminating parental rights under Social Services Law \u00a7 384-b, and committing her to the care and custody of DSS. Thereafter, on or around April 5, 2010, Hailey\u2019s caseworker had a conversation with Hailey\u2019s father in which the caseworker told him that DSS had ruled out his father and one of his sisters as possible caregivers.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">Hailey\u2019s mother voluntarily surrendered her parental rights. Hailey\u2019s father was told that if he did the same, DSS would permit him to see Hailey\u2014but only once a year. He refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">In the summer of 2010, Hailey and her half-sister were transferred from N\u2019s foster home to that of other nonrelative foster parents. Whereas N had facilitated communication between Hailey and her father, who regularly sent cards to her, neither the new foster parents nor DSS provided Hailey\u2019s father with her new address.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">At the fact-finding hearing held in Supreme Court on July 23, 2010, Hailey\u2019s three successive caseworkers testified, as did her father. One caseworker was asked whether K had been considered a \u201cresource\u201d who could look after Hailey. She could not remember, but said she believed that K had been \u201cexplored.\u201d The caseworker could not recall whether P had been \u2018\u2018explore [d].\u201d The third caseworker testified that DSS had ruled out Hailey\u2019s paternal grandfather and at least one of the sisters proposed by Hailey\u2019s father, but could not recall what it was in her background that had ruled her out, or even which sister it was.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-9\">For his part, Hailey\u2019s father testified that his sister F who was employed and had an infant daughter of her own whom she cared for, could look after Hailey. He insisted that he had received no response to this suggestion from DSS. Asked whether P had been the subject \u201cof a hotline alleging abuse or neglect on her part,\u201d Hailey\u2019s father responded in the negative. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>Asked whether P had lost a job working with the elderly \u201cbecause she was hotlined for elder abuse,\u201d Hailey\u2019s father initially answered with the word \u201cYes.\u201d But he then immediately clarified that P had been \u201chotlined\u201d\u2014had been the subject of a complaint made in a call to a telephone service\u2014 and had lost her job thereafter, but she had never been told what perceived wrong she had been \u201chotlined\u201d for.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">Hailey\u2019s father also mentioned someone else who might file for custody or guardianship of his daughter\u2014his girlfriend, who worked as a teacher\u2019s aide at an elementary school and had custody of her younger siblings. He conceded that his father would not be a suitable caregiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">Asked to describe his relationship with his daughter, Hailey\u2019s father began by saying \u201cI\u2019d do anything for her,\u201d and described the mutual happiness their relationship gave them. On cross-examination, he conceded, \u201cI would sign over my rights if you guys were going to be a little more lenient on this whole visitation. ... I don\u2019t want to be taken out of her life, but I\u2019m not going along with two hours once a year.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">As the majority notes, Supreme Court granted DSS\u2019s application to adjudicate Hailey a permanently neglected child, finding that DSS had made the requisite \u201cdiligent efforts\u201d to encourage and strengthen the parental relationship, and that Hailey\u2019s father had failed to plan for her future for more than a year after she came into DSS\u2019s custody. In discussing the possible caretakers Hailey\u2019s father had proposed, Supreme Court, without reference to his testimony on the subject, simply stated that P had been \u201cfired from her employment, working with the elderly, due to elder abuse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">At the subsequent dispositional hearing, DSS argued in favor of Hailey\u2019s adoption by the foster parents with whom she was living, and Hailey\u2019s father asked for visitation if she were adopted. Supreme Court terminated Hailey\u2019s father\u2019s parental rights, and determined that posttermination visitation would not be in Hailey\u2019s best interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-9\">IL</p>\n<p id=\"b520-10\">The majority concedes, as it must, that \u201c[a]n authorized agency that brings a proceeding to terminate parental rights based upon permanent neglect bears the burden of establishing that it has made \u2018diligent efforts to encourage and strengthen the parental relationship\u2019 \u201d (majority op at 429, quoting Social <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>Services Law \u00a7 384-b [7] [a]). In the first instance, I differ from the majority in that I believe there is no record support for the finding that DSS met this burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">DSS had to show\u2014by \u201cclear and convincing proof\u201d (Social Services Law \u00a7 384-b [3] [g] [i]; <em>see </em>[4] [d]; [7] [a])\u2014that it provided adequate assistance to Hailey\u2019s father with a view to \u201cresolving] or ameliorating] the problems preventing discharge of the child to [his] care\u201d <em>(Matter of Star Leslie W., </em>63 NY2d 136, 142 [1984]; <em>see </em>Social Services Law \u00a7 384-b [7] [f|). The requirements are stringent, and, unless it would be detrimental to the child\u2019s best interests, the agency\u2019s efforts must be directed towards the goal of <em>returning the child to his or her parent. </em>We have insisted that the petitioning agency is required to \u201cdetermine the particular problems facing a parent with respect to the return of his or her child and make affirmative, repeated, and meaningful efforts to assist the parent in overcoming these handicaps\u201d <em>(Matter of Sheila G., </em>61 NY2d 368, 385 [1984]). And the statute itself requires\u2014and required on July 23, 2010, when the fact-finding hearing in this case was held\u2014 that the hearing court \u201cshall consider the special circumstances of an incarcerated parent or parents . . . when determining whether a child is a \u2018permanently neglected child\u2019 \u201d (Social Services Law \u00a7 384-b [7] [a]).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">There is no record support for the finding that DSS exercised diligent efforts to encourage and strengthen the parental relationship with Hailey, with a view to returning Hailey to her father. Here, \u201cthe particular problems facing [Hailey\u2019s father] with respect to the return of his . . . child\u201d <em>(Sheila G., </em>61 NY2d at 385) were that he was incarcerated, that he was required to identify a suitable custodian for Hailey who could look after her until he was able to care for her himself <em>(see generally </em>Family Ct Act \u00a7 1017), and that his own biological parents would not be considered suitable caregivers. DSS was obliged to \u201cmake affirmative, repeated, and meaningful efforts\u201d to help Hailey\u2019s father overcome these handicaps <em>(Sheila G., </em>61 NY2d at 385). Such efforts should clearly have included straightforward and unambiguous communications to Hailey\u2019s father of the need for him to identify a suitable custodian and, after he mentioned his sisters, meaningful efforts to determine whether one of the sisters would have been able to look after Hailey.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">Instead, DSS failed to communicate the urgent need of finding a suitable caregiver until it was effectively too late. Notably, the January 26, 2010 letter from Hailey\u2019s DSS caseworker <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>makes no mention of the need for Hailey\u2019s father to propose possible custodians of Hailey other than those he had already mentioned. Additionally, DSS did not notify Hailey\u2019s father in the March 16, 2010 letter or any other letter that any nonrelative he named would have to be a certified foster parent, so that he was unaware that his girlfriend would not be immediately acceptable, despite her qualifications as a teacher\u2019s aide.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">Nor is there any evidence in the record of the required \u201crepeated . . . efforts\u201d <em>(Sheila G., </em>61 NY2d at 385) to get to the bottom of whether one of Hailey\u2019s father\u2019s sisters would be able to care for Hailey until her father was able to do so himself. The record is devoid of support for a finding that DSS even attempted to contact E It appears that DSS jumped to the conclusion that she was unsuitable because of her allegedly being \u201chotlined,\u201d but the record contains no evidence of the nature of this \u201chotiming,\u201d or of whether the allegations against P were ever substantiated. There is no suggestion that P was charged. All the record contains is a bare accusation. It is regrettable that the majority repeats the accusation as if the record supported its truth <em>(see </em>majority op at 427).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">To meet its obligation of proving by clear and convincing evidence that it made the necessary diligent efforts, DSS must establish more than that it rejected an alternative resource suggested by him; it must prove a sound basis for that rejection. At the time of the fact-finding hearing, P had a child of her own, and certainly there was no evidence that DSS sought to take that child away from her. In short, the record shows a bureaucratic shortcut to judgment on the part of DSS and the lower courts, and that the parental rights of Hailey\u2019s father should not have been terminated.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>IIL</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">As to the question whether the hearing court has the authority to order contact between a parent and his or her child after parental rights have been terminated under Social Services Law \u00a7 384-b, I believe the hearing court has the authority to do so\u2014 not because the parent still retains rights over the child <em>(see </em>Domestic Relations Law \u00a7 117 [1] [a]), but in the exercise of proper discretion by the court. In <em>Matter of Gregory B. </em>(74 NY2d 77 [1989]), we left open the question of such \u201cdiscretionary authority\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 91 [\u201cWe express no opinion as to whether such contacts generally would be helpful and appropriate once parental rights have been terminated and the child has been adopted into a new family or whether a court should have the discretionary authority to order such contacts\u201d]).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">The first thing to be said about this issue is that reasonable opinions on it differ. The Appellate Divisions are split on the matter, with the First and Third Departments taking the position that courts have no authority to order posttermination contact, and the Second<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and Fourth Departments taking the view that they do. Even the amici in the present case are split; we received a defense of the status quo in the Fourth Department from the Legal Aid Bureau of Buffalo and a critique from the Monroe County Attorney. With this in mind, I would prefer to sanction, rather than restrict, the hearing court\u2019s exercise of discretion, particularly in the area of family law where flexibility in judicial decision-making is a virtue of the highest order. The most fundamental determination in this area is the inherently discretionary one of what is in a child\u2019s best interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">In my view, the Fourth Department had it right. A hearing court \u201cmay, in those cases in which the court deems it appropriate, exercise its discretion in determining whether some form of posttermination contact with the biological parent is in the best interests of the child\u201d <em>(Matter of Kahlil S., </em>35 AD3d 1164, 1165 [4th Dept 2006] [remitting to Family Court for a hearing to determine whether posttermination contact was in the best interests of the children, and noting the psychological harm that may result from \u201can abrupt and complete cessation of contact\u201d between a child and her biological parent, especially when the child \u201chas strong emotional attachments to the birth family\u201d]).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>The statutory basis is Family Court Act \u00a7 634, which provides that, with respect to a disposition on an adjudication of permanent neglect, the hearing court may enter the order \u201con such conditions, if any, as it deems proper.\u201d The majority makes much of the fact that the Legislature has not explicitly \u201csanctioned judicial imposition of posttermination contact where parental rights are terminated after a contested proceeding\u201d (majority op at 438). However, it is worth noting that the Legislature has also not seen fit to <em>eliminate </em>the judicial imposition of posttermination contact in the six years since <em>Kahlil </em>was decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\"><em>Kahlil </em>hearings, as they are called, are now commonplace in the Fourth Department. As the Legal Aid Bureau of Buffalo suggests, the process can be particularly valuable when the biological parent\u2019s rights have been terminated on the ground of a mental disability of one kind or another on the part of the parent, rather than permanent neglect. In these situations the child\u2019s attachment to a natural parent who is incapable of looking after the child through no fault of his or her own may be profound, and worthy of preservation. Conversely, it may be in the best interests of a disabled, institutionalized child for there to be court-sanctioned posttermination visitation, when there is a mutual emotional attachment <em>(see e.g. Matter of Kyshawn F., </em>95 AD3d 883 [2d Dept 2012]). In fact, DSS does not dispute that the best interests of some children may be served by post-termination visitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">As a matter of policy and, more fundamentally, logic, it makes little sense to prohibit a court from ordering visitation <em>when that would be in a child\u2019s best interests, </em>simply because the person seeking visitation contested the issue of his or her parental rights. Indeed, in the present case this perceived restriction meant that a visitation agreement could be and was executed with Hailey\u2019s birth mother, who apparently has never shown very much interest in her, whereas Hailey\u2019s biological father, who has at every turn tried to be a responsible parent and to strengthen his ties with his daughter, is denied visitation. In my view, this is patently unfair. And in a future case\u2014 one in which the hearing court is ready to find visitation to be in the child\u2019s best interests\u2014the prohibition would undoubtedly be harmful to some degree or other to the child\u2019s psychological well-being.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">Lastly, as this case itself illustrates, the alternative of surrendering one\u2019s parental rights in exchange for visitation, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>the majority emphasizes, is often no real alternative at all. Hailey\u2019s father, despite successful, monthly visitation and even more frequent contact by mail, was offered <em>annual </em>visitation\u2014 less than he was enjoying at the time and clearly not an opportunity to continue the meaningful relationship he had with his daughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">Neither DSS nor Hailey\u2019s own attorney\u2014who submitted a brief but did not appear at oral argument\u2014argues with much conviction that visitation would not be in Hailey\u2019s best interests. In fact, her attorney adds nothing specific with respect to Hailey in the part of his brief that discusses the visitation issue. I am not convinced that Supreme Court was correct in its view that \u201cthere was no evidence presented to show there is a strong emotional bond between the respondent and the child or that any harm would come from discontinuing said visitation.\u201d The visitation issue was decided by the Appellate Division on the ground that the hearing court lacked authority to grant posttermination visitation. Were I to agree that the permanent neglect petition was properly granted, I would nevertheless remit this matter to the Appellate Division to review whether visitation would be in Hailey\u2019s best interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">For the reasons stated in part II of this opinion, I would reverse the order of the Appellate Division, and dismiss the permanent neglect petition, without prejudice to future proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-9\">Chief Judge Lippman and Judges Ciparick, Graffeo, Smith and Jones concur with Judge Read; Judge Pigott dissents and votes to reverse in a separate opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-10\">Order affirmed, without costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b519-10\">. If there were other communications before the March 16 letter in which all this was straightforwardly explained, I do not find clear and convincing proof of them in the record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b522-7\">. In my view, to the extent that Hailey\u2019s father may have failed to plan for her future in a realistic, feasible way, that failure is excused by the failure of DSS to exercise the requisite diligent efforts. Moreover, whether Hailey\u2019s father failed to plan for her future may be debated. Contrary to the majority (see majority op at 431), it is not true that his only plan was to allow Hailey to remain in foster care until he was released from prison. He had a reasonable backup plan; he consistently argued that his sister P was a suitable alternative. I accept that \u201can incarcerated parent may not satisfy the planning requirement of the statute where the only plan offered is long-term foster care lasting potentially for the child\u2019s entire minority\u201d <em>(Matter of Gregory B., </em>74 NY2d 77, 90 [1989]). Here, however, there is no support for the view that Hailey\u2019s father\u2019s only workable plan was to keep Hailey \u201cin foster care while maintaining contact. . . during the period of incarceration\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 87-88).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b523-8\">.
