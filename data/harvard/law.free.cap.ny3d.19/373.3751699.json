The investigation included interviews with many such people, who were promised confidentiality and asked to provide the names of those who had been in the party with them.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">An historian of the period now seeks disclosure under the Freedom of Information Law (FOIL) of unredacted transcripts of the interviews. We hold that she is entitled to everything in the transcripts except material that would identify informants who were promised confidentiality.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b455-10\">It seems that the Board of Education\u2019s \u201cAnti-Communist Investigations\u201d existed as early as 1936 and as late as 1962, but were at their most intense in the 1940s and 1950s. During that time, according to the petition in this case, an assistant corporation counsel for New York City \u201cwas assigned full-time for nearly a decade to ferret out alleged Communists and unrepentant former Communists in the New York City public school and university system.\u201d The records generated by the investigation include, according to the City, documentation of some 1,100 interviews.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-11\">According to a random sampling of the records by the City, all of the interviews included a promise of confidentiality, couched <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>in very similar language. The interviewer would typically begin by saying that \u201cthere has been and will be no publicity given to the fact that you and I are having this discussion.\u201d He would add that the interview was \u201ca matter of strict confidence between the Superintendent of Schools, acting through me, and yourself.\u201d Sometimes the interviewee would ask for, and receive, more assurance on that subject. The City points to one interview transcript that contains several such exchanges, including the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-5\">\u201cI know that the sins of the parents are visited upon their children, and it\u2019s quite a thing for my son\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-6\">\u201cQ. Well, nobody would know. This is strictly confidential.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-7\">\u201cA. I wouldn\u2019t want him, under any circumstance, to find out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-8\">\u201cQ. No, he won\u2019t, don\u2019t you worry about that. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-9\">\u201cA. . . . rather than have any repercussion on my son, I would\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-10\">\u201cQ. Please accept my word for it\u2014so just don\u2019t talk about it any more, there will be none, because, believe me, you are not the first teacher we have spoken to under these circumstances\u2014there have been a substantial number, believe me\u2014nobody knows they have been here, not even their principals; in some cases, like in your case, the members of their family don\u2019t know; they will never know, it\u2019s a closed door, so don\u2019t be concerned about it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A4b\">Petitioner is an historian with a personal reason for her interest in this bit of history: Both her parents were targets of the Anti-Communist Investigations, and her mother was among those interviewed. Beginning in 2007, petitioner sought access to the City\u2019s records relating to the investigations. She was granted access to some records, but the City\u2019s Department of Records and Information Services expressed concern that some of the material she sought would invade the privacy of people identified in the files. Eventually, the Department adopted a rule, the effect of which is to require redaction of any names and other identifying information, unless the person in question, or his or her legal heirs or custodians, has agreed to disclosure <em>(see </em>49 RCNY 3-02).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>As a result, petitioner has seen only redacted versions of the interview transcripts. For example, one transcript in the record on appeal contains this among many similar passages:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-5\">\u201cQ. I see. All right. Now let\u2019s take this third group.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-6\">Who were the members of this group that you recall?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-7\">\u201cA. [lengthy redaction] this [redaction], you say, [redaction]\u2014and that red-haired girl, [redaction].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-8\">\u201cQ. That\u2019s [redaction]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-9\">\u201cA. Right.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-10\">The City offered petitioner access to unredacted files on condition \u201cthat she agree not to publish names,\u201d a condition she rejected. She brought this proceeding under article 78 of the CPLR to require the Department to disclose the files without redaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-11\">Supreme Court dismissed the petition (2010 NY Slip Op 33774[U] [2010]), holding that the City was entitled to redact the documents to avoid an \u201cunwarranted invasion of personal privacy\u201d (Public Officers Law \u00a7 87 [2] [b]), and the Appellate Division affirmed <em>(Matter of Harbatkin v New York City Dept. of Records &amp; Info. Servs., </em>84 AD3d 700 [1st Dept 2011]). Petitioner appealed as of right to this Court pursuant to CPLR 5601 (b) (1), which permits such appeals \u201cwhere there is directly involved the construction of the constitution of the state or of the United States,\u201d and also moved for permission to appeal pursuant to CPLR 5602 (a). We retained the appeal as of right, and refrained from deciding the motion for permission to appeal, pending oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-12\">We now conclude that petitioner\u2019s constitutional arguments lack substance, and therefore dismiss the appeal as of right. We grant the motion for permission to appeal, and modify the Appellate Division order, permitting the City to redact only names and other identifying details relating to informants who were promised confidentiality.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-13\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b457-14\">FOIL requires government agencies to \u201cmake available for public inspection and copying all records\u201d subject to a number of exemptions (Public Officers Law \u00a7 87 [2]). The exemption at issue in this case permits an agency to deny access to records that \u201cif disclosed would constitute an unwarranted invasion of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>personal privacy\u201d (Public Officers Law \u00a7 87 [2] [b]). Public Officers Law \u00a7 89 (2) (b) says that \u201c[a]n unwarranted invasion of personal privacy includes, but shall not be limited to\u201d seven specified kinds of disclosure. In a case, like this one, where none of the seven specifications is applicable, a court \u201cmust decide whether any invasion of privacy ... is \u2018unwarranted\u2019 by balancing the privacy interests at stake against the public interest in disclosure of the information\u201d <em>(Matter of New York Times Co. v City of N.Y. Fire Dept., </em>4 NY3d 477, 485 [2005]).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">We begin by considering the redaction of names and identifying details of people, other than the people interviewed, mentioned in the interview transcripts. We conclude that today, more than half a century after the interviews took place, the disclosure of the deleted information would not be an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. Certainly, this was not always true. At the time of the investigations, and for some years thereafter, public knowledge that people were named as present or former Communists would have subjected them to enormous embarrassment, or worse. But that embarrassment would be much diminished today\u2014both because the activity of which they were accused took place so long ago, and because the label \u201cCommunist\u201d carries far less emotional power than it did in the 1950s.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">We do not say that disclosure will be completely harmless to those named in the documents, if they are still alive, or to members of their families who care about their memories (see <em>Matter of New York Times Co., 4 </em>NY3d at 484-485 [recognizing that a right of privacy exists in the affairs of the dead]). But the diminished claims of privacy must be weighed against the claims of history. The story of the Anti-Communist Investigations, like any other that is a significant part of our past, should be told as fully and as accurately as possible, and historians are better equipped to do so when they can work from uncensored records. Petitioner, or any other historian trying to trace the course of the investigations, would obviously face a serious handicap if required to work with the redacted transcript from which we quoted above.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">We strike a different balance, however, when we consider petitioner\u2019s request for the names of interviewees who were promised that no one would find out they were being interviewed. We find it unacceptable for the government to break that promise, even after all these years. We quoted earlier in this opinion from the interview of a teacher who feared that her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>son might learn she was being questioned about Communist activities. It is unlikely that she is still alive\u2014the interview shows that her teaching career began in 1934 or earlier\u2014but her son may be. The risk that he would be hurt or embarrassed by learning now of his mother\u2019s interview may be small, but a representative of New York City\u2019s government solemnly assured her that the government would not subject him to that risk. Perhaps there will be a time when the promise made to her, and to others similarly situated, is so ancient that its enforcement would be pointless, but that time is not yet.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be modified in accordance with this opinion and, as so modified, affirmed, without costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">Chief Judge Lippman and Judges Cipakick, Graffeo, Read, Pigott and Jones concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">Order modified, etc.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
