We conclude that it is not, and, therefore, the New York State Division of Human Rights (SDHR) lacks jurisdiction to investigate complaints against public school districts under that provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b566-9\">The public school students in these proceedings filed complaints with the SDHR, claiming that their respective school districts engaged in an \u201cunlawful discriminatory practice\u201d under article 15 of the Executive Law (Executive Law \u00a7 290 <em>et seq. </em>[Human Rights Law]) by permitting their harassment on the basis of race and/or disability (Executive Law \u00a7 296 [4]).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-10\">Both school districts commenced a CPLR article 78 proceeding seeking a writ of prohibition barring the SDHR from investigating the complaints on the ground that a public school district is not an \u201ceducation corporation or association\u201d as contemplated by Executive Law \u00a7 296 (4). Supreme Court in <em>Matter of North Syracuse Cent. School Dist. </em>granted the petition on that ground; Supreme Court in <em>Matter of Ithaca City School Dist. </em>held otherwise, concluding that a school district is an \u201ceducation corporation\u201d that the SDHR could investigate.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>At this point, the procedural paths of the appeals diverged. The SDHR appealed in the <em>North Syracuse Cent. School Dist. </em>matter, and the Appellate Division, Fourth Department, reversed, holding that the SDHR\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction should have been challenged first during administrative review, not in a CPLR article 78 proceeding (83 AD3d 1472 [4th Dept 2011]).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\">The Ithaca City School District had withdrawn its appeal to the Appellate Division, Third Department. The parties proceeded to a hearing on the discrimination complaint before an administrative law judge, who concluded, among other things, that the district had permitted discriminatory conduct and awarded complainant and her mother $500,000 each. The Commissioner of Human Rights reduced each award to $200,000. The Ithaca City School District thereafter commenced a CPLR article 78 proceeding seeking vacatur and annulment of the SDHR\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">Supreme Court annulled the SDHR\u2019s determination, holding that it lacked the authority to hear and determine complaints against the district because a school district is not an \u201ceducation corporation\u201d under section 296 (4). The Appellate Division, Third Department, with one Justice dissenting, modified the mother\u2019s award by reducing it to $50,000 and otherwise confirmed the determination. Relying on the legislative findings set forth in Executive Law \u00a7 290 (3) that the Human Rights Law was intended \u201cto eliminate and prevent discrimination . . . in educational institutions,\u201d the Appellate Division held that \u201cpublic school districts are among the \u2018educational institutions\u2019 over which [the] SDHR has jurisdiction and that Executive Law \u00a7 296 (4) is the statutory mechanism by which it can seek to eliminate any discrimination by such school districts\u201d (87 AD3d 268, 273 [3d Dept 2011]). This Court granted leave in both appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">Executive Law \u00a7 296 (4) provides, in relevant part, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-8\">\u201c [i]t shall be an unlawful discriminatory practice for an <em>education corporation or association </em>which holds itself out to the public to be non-sectarian and exempt from taxation pursuant to . . . [RPTL article 4] ... to permit the harassment of any student or applicant, by reason of his race . ...

That approach is a legitimate one given that the General Construction Law is \u201capplicable to <em>every statute </em>unless its general object, or the context of the language construed, or other provisions of law indicate that a different meaning or application was intended\u201d (General Construction Law \u00a7 110 [emphasis supplied]). On the other hand, application of the General Construction Law is problematic, however, because the provision at issue in the Executive Law was enacted 15 years prior to General Construction Law \u00a7\u00a7 65 and 66\u2014the provisions upon which the Appellate Division relied on in <em>East Meadow Union Free School </em>Dist.\u2014 and the SDHR, relying on the exceptions contained in General Construction Law \u00a7 110, contends that the Legislature never meant for those definitions to apply to Executive Law \u00a7 296 (4). We need not address whether the General Construction Law is applicable here, however, because there is independent basis, supported by legislative history, for our conclusion that a public school district is not an \u201ceducation corporation or association.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">The SDHR asks this Court to adopt the Appellate Division\u2019s rationale in <em>Matter of Ithaca City School Dist. </em>and liberally construe the \u201cgeneral purpose\u201d of the Human Rights Law, which is to \u201celiminate and prevent discrimination ... in educational institutions\u201d (Executive Law \u00a7 290 [3]), and conclude that a public school district is an \u201ceducation corporation or association.\u201d That argument, however, overlooks the basic premise that there must first be an underlying directive in the statute before this Court can apply such a construction. And it is evident from the legislative history that the term \u201ceducation corporation or association,\u201d the origins of which can be traced to the Tax Law, refers to only private, non-sectarian entities that are exempt from taxation under RPTL article 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">The demarcation between tax exemption for public and certain private property dates back to 1896, when the Legislature enacted Tax Law \u00a7 4. That section expressly differentiated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>the tax-exempt status for \u201c[pjroperty of a municipal corporation of the state held for a public use\u201d (Tax Law \u00a7 4 [3], as added by L 1896, ch 908), i.e., school district property, from the tax-exempt status of</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-4\">\u201c[t]he real property of a <em>corporation or association </em>organized exclusively for the moral or mental improvement of men or women, or for religious, bible, tract, charitable, benevolent, missionary, hospital, infirmary, educational, public playground, scientific, literary, bar association, library, patriotic, historical or cemetery purposes, or for the enforcement of laws relating to children or animals, or two or more such purposes and used exclusively for carrying out thereupon one or more of such purposes\u201d (Tax Law \u00a7 4 [7] [emphasis supplied]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">Subdivisions (3) and (7) of Tax Law \u00a7 4 plainly had different aims, with the latter addressing the tax-exempt status of private property ostensibly used to carry out a public purpose <em>(see </em>Problems Relating to Taxation and Finance, 1938 Report of New York State Constitutional Convention Committee, vol 10, at 198, 201-205). Indeed, the Legislature enacted Tax Law \u00a7 4 (7) to prohibit the granting of special real property tax exemptions to individual <em>corporations, </em>and to ensure that such corporations received such an exemption only if they used their property to provide a public service <em>(id. </em>at 201-205).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">In 1933, the Legislature retained the language set forth in Tax Law \u00a7 4 (7), renamed it Tax Law \u00a7 4 (6) (L 1933, ch 470, \u00a7 3), and in 1935 added the following proviso: \u201cNo <em>education corporation or association </em>that holds itself out to the public to be non-sectarian and exempt from taxation pursuant to the provisions of this section shall deny the use of its facilities to any person otherwise qualified, by reason of his race, color or religion\u201d (L 1935, ch 852, \u00a7 1 [emphasis supplied]). The language was added after the Legislature received a report from the New York State Commission for the Revision of Tax Laws (Tax Commission), which, in part, addressed tax exemptions for government-owned and privately-owned real property (1935 NY Legis Doc No. 62, at 35-59). The exemptions discussed in that report were embodied in Tax Law \u00a7 4 <em>(id. </em>at 40 n 15).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">In its report, the Tax Commission observed that \u201c[m]ost of the exemptions of privately owned real property resulted] from the enumeration and definition of specific public uses,\u201d meaning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>that tax exemptions for private property were granted because the exempt property was being \u201cused in doing what the government might otherwise be compelled to do, in fulfilling a responsibility which it has definitely undertaken,\u201d or, what the Legislature deemed a <em>\u201cnecessary </em>public purpose\u201d (1935 NY Legis Doc No. 62, at 44). Significantly, as relevant to this appeal, under the heading <em>\u201cPrivately Owned Property Devoted to a Public Use,\u201d </em>the Tax Commission listed a number of private entities referenced in now-former Tax Law \u00a7 4 (6) <em>(id. </em>at 44-48 [emphasis supplied]). The similarities between the types of privately-owned exempt property delineated in the Tax Commission\u2019s Report and Tax Law \u00a7 4 (6) are striking and hardly coincidental.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">For instance, the Tax Commission, utilizing terms almost identical to those used in Tax Law \u00a7 4 (6), listed as tax-exempt the following <em>private </em>property owned by <em>private </em>organizations: religious property (\u201corganized exclusively for religious, bible, tract, or missionary purposes, or for the moral or mental improvement of men or women\u201d); charitable property (\u201cowned by associations organized exclusively for charitable purposes\u201d); fraternal and benevolent property (which \u201crelieve[s] the state of part of its traditional burden of caring for the poor, aged, and helpless\u201d); hospital property (which \u201cprotect[s]\u201d the public health, \u201cone of the most important of the necessary public purposes of the state\u201d); occupational association property (property of \u201c[h]ar association\u201d and use of county fair grounds for agricultural exhibitions); and miscellaneous property (cemeteries and property owned by \u201cpatriotic\u201d organizations) <em>(compare </em>Tax Law \u00a7 4 [6], <em>with </em>1935 NY Legis Doc No. 62, at 44-48).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">The most significant item demarcated in the Tax Commission\u2019s list of <em>private </em>property subject to tax exemption was \u201c[e]ducational [p]roperty,\u201d to which the Tax Commission devoted an entire section (1935 NY Legis Doc No. 62, at 44). The Tax Commission noted that \u201c[r]eal property owned by educational institutions is exempt only to the extent that the educational purpose is \u2018exclusively\u2019 carried out \u2018thereupon,\u2019 \u201d quoting from Tax Law \u00a7 4 (6) that \u201creal property of a corporation or association organized exclusively for . . . educational . . . purposes\u201d is tax exempt if \u201cused exclusively for carrying out thereupon\u201d such a purpose (1935 NY Legis Doc No. 62, at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>44).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Indeed, it was acknowledged after the enactment of Tax Law \u00a7 4 (6) that \u201c[w]ith the assumption by the public authority of the function of public education, the basis for the exemption of . . . non-profit making private institutions which carried an elementary and secondary educational work changed,\u201d and the State \u201crecognized . . . that [such] institutions were performing not merely a <em>desirable </em>public purpose but even a <em>necessary </em>one\u2014a purpose which the government itself was serving\u201d (Problems Relating to Taxation and Finance, 1938 Report of New York State Constitutional Convention Committee, vol 10, at 217). Because the government derived a benefit from the work of these institutions, i.e., it was relieved of the expense of providing education to students of private institutions, \u201c[t]he least that the public authority could do as a recompense of the institutions for the services they were rendering and the money they were saving the authority was to free these institutions from taxation\u201d <em>(id.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\">Given the foregoing, the \u201ceducational\u201d property delineated in Tax Law \u00a7 4 (6) plainly referred to privately-owned property that was tax-exempt because it provided a public service; consequently, the use of the term \u201ceducation corporation or association\u201d in that same provision plainly referred to private, non-sectarian entities that owned \u201ceducational\u201d property utilized for a public purpose. Although the corporations and associations delineated in Tax Law \u00a7 4 (6) provide different services, they share one thing in common: their property is privately owned and it is afforded tax-exempt status because those corporations or associations perform a public service that the government recognizes as worthy of special tax treatment (1935 NY Legis Doc No. 62, at 44-48).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">In light of the legislative history surrounding the enactment of Tax Law \u00a7 4 (6), and given the circumstances under which the Legislature transferred the term \u201ceducation corporation or association\u201d from Tax Law \u00a7 4 (6) to Executive Law \u00a7 296 (4), we reject the SDHR\u2019s assertion that \u201ceducation corporation or association\u201d applies to a public school district. In 1951, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>Legislature created the State Commission Against Discrimination<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to \u201celiminate and prevent discrimination in <em>employment </em>because of race, creed, color or national origin\u201d (Executive Law \u00a7\u00a7 290, 293, as added by L 1951, ch 800 [emphasis supplied]). The following year the law was amended granting the State Commission the authority to also \u201celiminate and prevent discrimination ... in places of public accommodation, resort or amusement\u201d (Executive Law \u00a7 290, as amended by L 1952, ch 285, \u00a7 1). As pertinent here, in 1958, the Legislature amended Executive Law \u00a7 296 (4) as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-5\">\u201cIt shall be an unlawful discriminatory practice for an <em>education corporation or association </em>which holds itself out to the public to be non-sectarian and exempt from taxation pursuant to the . . . provisions of [RPTL article 4] to deny the use of its facilities to any person otherwise qualified, by reason of his race, color or religion\u201d (L 1958, ch 960, \u00a7 23 [emphasis supplied]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">This language was taken almost verbatim from Tax Law \u00a7 4 (6).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">The term \u201ceducation corporation or association\u201d is retained in Executive Law \u00a7 296 (4) to this day. The Human Rights Law is silent as to what constitutes an \u201ceducation corporation or association,\u201d but the fact that such language was taken directly from the Tax Law and moved to Executive Law \u00a7 296 (4) bespeaks the Legislature\u2019s intention that the term was to have the same meaning in the Executive Law as it did in former Tax Law \u00a7 4 (6). Moreover, the use of the phrase \u201cnon-sectarian\u201d was plainly included in Executive Law \u00a7 296 (4) to carve out an exception for parochial schools, while reserving for the SDHR the jurisdiction to investigate section 296 (4) complaints against private, non-sectarian education corporations or associations.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">Public school districts are different from private, nonsectarian institutions and fall outside the purview of the SDHR\u2019s jurisdiction relative to section 296 (4) claims. To be sure, school districts own tax-exempt property and serve a public purpose, but they do so as part of a public system, not a private one. And a public school district receives tax-exempt status by virtue of the fact that it is public, so there would never be any need for it to \u201chold[ ] itself out to the public to be non-sectarian\u201d as, say, a private school.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>The vicious attacks to which these students were subjected are deplorable, and our holding is not to be interpreted as indifference to their plight, since the merits of their underlying discrimination claims are not at issue on these appeals. Nor does our holding leave public school students without a remedy. In addition to potential remedies under federal law, public school students may file a complaint with the Commissioner of Education <em>(see </em>Education Law \u00a7 310). Moreover, in 2010, the Legislature enacted the \u201cDignity for All Students Act,\u201d establishing article 2 of the Education Law, designed \u201cto afford all [public school] students an environment free of any harassment that substantially interferes with their education, regardless of the basis of the harassment, and free of discrimination based on actual or perceived race, color, weight, national origin, ethnic group, religion, disability, sexual orientation, gender, or sex\u201d (Sponsor\u2019s Mem, Bill Jacket, L 2010, ch 482, at 21, 2010 McKinney\u2019s Session Laws of NY, at 2051-2052; <em>see also </em>Education Law \u00a7\u00a7 10-18 [eff July 1, 2012]). Although the SDHR lauded this legislation by acknowledging that it \u201caddresses a myriad of harassment and discrimination issues that arise within a school context and its goals comport[ ] with the goals of the [Human Rights Law],\u201d noticeably absent from its correspondence was any indication that it had previously handled similar claims of that nature arising in public schools (Letter from NY St Div of Human Rights, July 22, 2010, Bill Jacket, L 2010, ch 482, at 34).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">Because a public school district is not an \u201ceducation corporation or association\u201d under Executive Law \u00a7 296 (4), the SDHR lacked jurisdiction to investigate the complaints filed by the students in these appeals.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">Accordingly, in <em>Matter of North Syracuse Cent.

Because I believe that exclusion of public school children from the full protection of the Human Rights Law contradicts the plain language of the statute, the Legislature\u2019s declared purpose and New York\u2019s fundamental public policy against discrimination, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">L</p>\n<p id=\"b574-8\">Ithaca City School District</p>\n<p id=\"b574-9\">During the 2005-2006 school year, petitioner\u2019s daughter (E.K), a 12-year-old African-American student attending public school in Ithaca, was repeatedly subjected to racial insults, threats and physical harm from a group of white male students. Among other things, the boys made comments to E.K. such as: \u201cDo you mind if I call you my nigger?\u201d and \u201cwe shoot niggers like you in the woods.\u201d One student told E.K. that he had a hunting rifle with her name on it. The majority of the incidents occurred on the school bus. Petitioner repeatedly sought help from school officials. Despite acknowledging that there was a \u201cracial tidal wave\u201d at the school and that E.K.\u2019s school bus was a \u201chell hole,\u201d officials only meted out ineffective one or two day suspensions on the perpetrators and refused to ban the offending students from the school bus.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>Because of the harassment, E.K.\u2019s grades fell and her mental health deteriorated. Petitioner filed a complaint with the SDHR. After a public hearing before an administrative law judge, it was determined that the school district had violated Executive Law \u00a7 296 (4) by permitting the repeated harassment of a student on the basis of race. Specifically, the division found that the school district \u201crepeatedly chose a course of action which both put the interests of the white male perpetrators ahead of the interests of the black female student, and was repeatedly shown to be, and acknowledged to be, ineffective in stopping the discriminatory conduct.\u201d The administrative law judge ordered the school district to pay compensatory damages to E.K. and her mother in the amount of $500,000 each. The SDHR affirmed the findings, but lowered both damage awards to $200,000. The school district challenged the determination. Supreme Court determined that the SDHR lacked jurisdiction to investigate public schools. The Appellate Division reversed holding that the SDHR did indeed have jurisdiction over public schools <em>(see Matter of Ithaca City School Dist. v New York State Div. of Human Rights, </em>87 AD3d 268 [3d Dept 2011]).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\">North Syracuse Central School District</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">The underlying complaint in this case was filed by the mother of a 14-year-old African-American student (L.T.), who attended public school in North Syracuse. The mother complained that her child was targeted for abuse because of her race and had been called names such as \u201cgorilla\u201d and \u201cfat black bitch.\u201d The SDHR investigated and interviewed school officials who confirmed that L.T. had been targeted by bullies but that the harassment was based on personal hygiene and weight as opposed to race and that the terms \u201cgorilla\u201d and \u201cfat black bitch\u201d were not \u201crace based insults.\u201d The SDHR found probable cause to support a violation of Executive Law \u00a7 296 (4) and ordered a full public hearing on the issue. The school district filed a CPLR article 78 petition in Supreme Court challenging the SDHR\u2019s jurisdiction. Supreme Court granted the petition, finding that the SDHR had no jurisdiction over the school district. The Appellate Division reversed, holding that the school district was required to exhaust its administrative remedies, including raising its jurisdictional challenge to the SDHR prior to commencing an article 78 proceeding <em>(Matter of North Syracuse Cent. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number><em>School Dist. v New York State Div. of Human Rights, </em>83 AD3d 1472 [4th Dept 2011]).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">IL</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">The majority has determined, through an analysis of tax law statutory history, that the term \u201ceducation corporation or association,\u201d as used in Executive Law \u00a7 296 (4), is intended to cover only private schools and accordingly provide protection for a very small percentage of students in the state. However, such an interpretation is contradicted by a plain reading of the statute, which we have long recognized as the clearest indication of legislative intent <em>(see Majewski v Broadalbin-Perth Cent. School Dist., </em>91 NY2d 577, 583 [1998]). Executive Law \u00a7 296 (4) prohibits discrimination by any \u201ceducation corporation or association which holds itself out to the public to be non-sectarian and exempt from taxation pursuant to the provisions of article four of the real property tax law.\u201d It is uncontroverted that the term \u201ceducation corporation or association\u201d is not defined within the Executive Law. It is beyond cavil that public school districts are corporations organized for educational purposes <em>(see </em>NY Const, art X, \u00a7 5) and public schools hold themselves out to the public as non-sectarian and are exempt from taxation pursuant to article 4 of the RPTL <em>(see </em>RPTL 408). Section 296 (4) brings within the protection of the Human Rights Law private educational institutions, which had not previously been covered. That it used identical language as the RPTL does not work to now exclude public school districts. Thus, a plain reading of the statute indicates that the Legislature intended to confer authority to the SDHR over both public and private schools and the historical statutory analysis performed by the majority runs counter to the plain language of the statute.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">Moreover, in interpreting the statute, we also examine the purpose of a statute in determining legislative intent <em>(see Matter of Sutka v Conners, </em>73 NY2d 395, 403 [1989]). Interpreting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>section 296 (4) as encompassing both public and private schools is in keeping with the overarching purpose of article 15 of the Executive Law\u2014the Human Rights Law\u2014which is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-4\">\u201cto assure that <em>every individual </em>within this state is afforded an equal opportunity to enjoy a full and productive life and that the failure to provide such equal opportunity, whether because of discrimination, prejudice, intolerance or <em>inadequate education, </em>training, housing or health care not only threatens the rights and proper privileges of its inhabitants but menaces the institutions and foundation of a free democratic state and threatens the peace, order, health, safety and general welfare of the state and its inhabitants\u201d (Executive Law \u00a7 290 [3] [emphasis added]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">This statute also provides for the creation of the SDHR in order to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-6\">\u201cencourage programs designed to insure that <em>every individual </em>shall have an equal opportunity to participate fully in the economic, cultural and intellectual life of the state; to encourage and promote the development and execution by all persons within the state of such state programs; to eliminate and prevent discrimination in employment, in places of public accommodation, resort or amusement, in <em>educational institutions, </em>in public services, in housing accommodations, in commercial space and in credit transactions and to take other actions against discrimination as herein provided; and the division established hereunder is hereby given general jurisdiction and power for such purposes\u201d <em>{id. </em>[emphasis added]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">This language clearly indicates that \u201cevery individual\u201d\u2014including every school-age child\u2014has a right to adequate education and that the SDHR has the authority, on behalf of \u201cevery individual,\u201d to prevent discrimination in \u201ceducational institutions.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The majority\u2019s limitation of the SDHR\u2019s jurisdiction to only private schools does little to promote the broad purposes of the Human Rights Law, which is to provide a bias-free education for every individual.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>Furthermore, by its own statutory language, \u201c[t]he provisions [of the Human Rights Law] shall be construed liberally for the accomplishment of the purposes thereof\u2019 (Executive Law \u00a7 300) and we have <em>consistently </em>embraced a liberal construction of the Human Rights Law in order to accomplish its stated purpose (see <em>Matter of Cahill v Rosa, </em>89 NY2d 14, 20 [1996] [holding that a private dentist\u2019s office is a place of public accommodation]). By adopting a strict and limiting interpretation of the statute, the majority is forgoing its duty to make sure that the Human Rights Law is implemented in such a way as to give every individual an opportunity for a bias-free education <em>(see City of Schenectady v State Div. of Human Rights, </em>37 NY2d 421, 428 [1975] [\u201cit is the duty of courts to make sure that the Human Rights Law works and that the intent of the Legislature is not thwarted by a combination of strict construction of the statute and a battle with semantics\u201d]). It is antithetical to the purpose of the Human Rights Law to exempt public schools from its mandate. We have noted that discrimination is \u201call the more invidious\u201d when practiced by state run entities <em>(Koerner v State of N.Y., Pilgrim Psychiatric Ctr., </em>62 NY2d 442, 448 [1984]). The clear and expressed intent of the Human Rights Law is to protect \u201cevery individual\u201d in the state from the evils of discrimination. As argued by the State, nothing in the text of the Human Rights Law compels a reading, as that employed by the majority, that would exclude public school districts from the coverage of section 296 (4) and its remedial purpose. It is implausible that the Legislature intended to exempt public schools and the thousands of children who attend these schools from the protection of the Human Rights Law and the oversight of the SDHR.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">Thus, I would affirm both Appellate Division orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">Judges Graffeo, Read and Smith concur with Judge Pigott; Judge Ciparick dissents and votes to affirm in a separate opinion in which Chief Judge Lippman and Judge Jones concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">In each case: Order reversed, etc.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b576-8\">. It should be noted that the statutory interpretation question was fully litigated below, although the Appellate Division did not reach it in dismissing the school district\u2019s petition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b576-9\">. That the Legislature intended to cover public schools is evident in that on the same day that it enacted Executive Law \u00a7 296 (4) <em>(see </em>L 1958, ch 960, \u00a7 23) it also amended the RPTL, adding article 4, which expressly included public school districts <em>(see </em>L 1958, ch 959). In fact, the Legislature, in the preamble to the act that enacted section 296, stated that the purpose of the act is \u201cto harmonize certain provisions [of the Executive Law] with the real property tax law\u201d (L 1958, ch 960).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b577-8\">. Notably, the statute uses the term \u201ceducational institutions\u201d here as opposed to, as the majority argues, the more restrictive term \u201ceducation corporation or association.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
