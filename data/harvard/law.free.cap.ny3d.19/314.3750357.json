Prior to sentencing, the People filed two statements of predicate felony conviction. The first, filed on December 17, 2008, the day after defendant\u2019s conviction, alleged that he had been convicted in the State of North Carolina of the offense of \u201cRobbery with [a] Dangerous Weapon,\u201d which made him a second felony drug offender whose prior felony conviction was a violent felony offense <em>(see </em>CPL 400.21; Penal Law \u00a7 70.70 [1] [c]; [4]). The second, filed on January 20, 2009, alleged that defendant had been convicted in the State of North Carolina of the crime of \u201cPossession with Intent to Sell and Deliver a Controlled Substance,\u201d making him a second felony drug offender <em>(see </em>CPL 400.21; Penal Law \u00a7 70.70 [1] [b]; [3]).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">Defendant sought an order declaring that neither statement created a basis for Supreme Court to determine that he was subject to an enhanced sentence as a second felony drug offender. With respect to the first statement of predicate felony conviction, he argued that Penal Law \u00a7 70.70 (4) does not authorize an enhanced sentencing range for a felony drug offender whose alleged prior violent felony conviction occurred in a foreign jurisdiction\u2014i.e., outside New York. After analysis of the relevant statutory provisions, considered as a whole and in light of the policy purposes to be served by the Drug Law Reform Act of 2004 (the DLRA), the judge held otherwise in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>decision dated February 26, 2009 (22 Misc 3d 1127[A], 2009 NY Slip Op 50311[U], *8 [2009]).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">Supreme Court then ruled that the North Carolina robbery statute is broader on its face than any New York felony. As a result, it would be possible for someone to be convicted of the North Carolina crime without having engaged in conduct that would constitute a robbery in New York. The judge concluded, however, that defendant\u2019s North Carolina conviction for robbery with a dangerous weapon, <em>\u201cas clarified by the Indictment, </em>. . . [was] equivalent to Robbery in the First Degree as well as Robbery in the Second and Third Degrees under New York law\u201d (2009 NY Slip Op 50311[U], *10 [emphasis added]). Given this disposition, he did not address the second statement of predicate felony conviction filed by the People.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">Consistent with this decision, Supreme Court on March 3, 2009 adjudicated defendant a second felony drug offender previously convicted of a violent felony <em>(see </em>CPL 400.21 [7] [c]; Penal Law \u00a7 70.70 [4]). The judge sentenced defendant on his class B felony conviction to a determinate prison term of six years, followed by IV2 years of postrelease supervision, to run concurrently with the sentences imposed on him for the two lesser drug crimes of which he was convicted <em>(see </em>Penal Law \u00a7 70.70 [4] [b] [i]). On defendant\u2019s appeal, the Appellate Division affirmed (82 AD3d 424 [1st Dept 2011]). A Judge of this Court subsequently granted defendant leave to appeal (17 NY3d 810 [2011]).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">L</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">Penal Law \u00a7 70.70 (1) (b) defines a \u201c[s]econd felony drug offender\u201d as a person convicted of a non-class A felony who is a \u201csecond felony offender\u201d as that term is defined in Penal Law \u00a7 70.06 (1). That provision, as relevant here, defines a \u201csecond felony offender\u201d as someone who has previously been convicted of a felony in New York, or somewhere else if the foreign offense is equivalent to a felony in New York <em>(see </em>Penal Law \u00a7 70.06 [1] [b] [i] [stating that \u201c(f)or the purpose of determining whether a prior conviction is a predicate felony conviction . . . (t)he conviction must have been in this state of a felony, or in any other jurisdiction of an offense for which a sentence to a term of imprisonment in excess of one year . . . was authorized and is authorized in this state irrespective of whether such sentence was imposed\u201d]). Penal Law \u00a7 70.70 (1) (c) defines a \u201c[v]iolent felony\u201d for sentencing purposes as having \u201cthe same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>meaning as that term is defined in\u201d Penal Law \u00a7 70.02 (1), which lists New York felony offenses by class. Section 70.70 then sets out the enhanced sentencing range for those second felony drug offenders previously convicted of a non-violent felony (Penal Law \u00a7 70.70 [3]); and a harsher sentencing range for those second felony drug offenders previously convicted of a violent felony (Penal Law \u00a7 70.70 [4]).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">Defendant argues that because Penal Law \u00a7 70.70 (1) (c) cross-references Penal Law \u00a7 70.02, a provision that enumerates <em>only </em>New York crimes, an out-of-state felony can never qualify as a violent felony for purposes of enhanced sentencing under Penal Law \u00a7 70.70 (4). We do not agree. As an initial matter, the statute\u2019s \u201cplain meaning\u201d does not support defendant\u2019s position, as he argues. Penal Law \u00a7 70.70 (4) applies to \u201ca <em>second felony drug offender </em>whose prior felony conviction was a violent felony\u201d (Penal Law \u00a7 70.70 [4] [b] [emphasis added]). As noted earlier, Penal Law \u00a7 70.70 (1) (b) cross-references Penal Law \u00a7 70.06 (1) when defining a \u201c[s]econd felony drug offender,\u201d and this provision, unlike section 70.02, encompasses out-of-state felonies.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">Importantly, Penal Law \u00a7 70.70 (4) also cross-references CPL 400.21. And section 400.21 mandates the use of out-of-state felony convictions when adjudicating a defendant a second felony drug offender previously convicted of a violent felony. Specifically, section 400.21 in three separate places instructs the prosecutor or the sentencing court to determine whether a defendant has been convicted of a qualifying foreign crime <em>(see </em>CPL 400.21 [2] [requiring a statement of predicate felony conviction to specify \u201cwhether the predicate felony conviction was a violent felony as that term is defined in (Penal Law \u00a7 70.02 [1]), or in any other jurisdiction of an offense which includes all of the essential elements of any such felony for which a sentence to a term of imprisonment in excess of one year . . . was authorized and is authorized in this state regardless of whether such sentence was imposed\u201d]; CPL 400.21 [4] [in a case where there is no further hearing after a preliminary examination, requiring the sentencing court to make a finding as to whether the defendant was previously convicted of a violent felony in New York or any other jurisdiction]; CPL 400.21 [7] [c] [in a case where there is a hearing, requiring the sentencing court to make a finding as to whether the defendant was subject to a predicate felony conviction, including a finding as to whether the predicate felony conviction was for a violent felony in New York or any other jurisdiction]).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>When enacting the DLRA, the Legislature created Penal Law \u00a7 70.70 to mandate enhanced sentences for second felony drug offenders, and amended CPL 400.21 in the ways described above so as to supply procedures for sentencing defendants subject to this new Penal Law provision <em>(see </em>L 2004, ch 738, \u00a7\u00a7 18, 36). Considering section 70.70 (4) in light of Penal Law \u00a7 70.06 (1) and CPL 400.21 (2), (4) and (7) (c), we conclude that the Legislature meant for prosecutors and sentencing courts to take foreign violent felony convictions into account when determining a defendant\u2019s sentencing status, notwithstanding the ambiguity created by the reference in section 70.70 (1) (c) to Penal Law \u00a7 70.02. This is, in our view, the more sensible and integrated reading of the interrelated statutory text.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">Our interpretation also comports more closely with the policy underlying the DLRA than does defendant\u2019s approach. As Supreme Court pointed out, while the DLRA\u2019s \u201cgeneral purpose . . . was to reduce sentences for drug offenders, the Act also modestly increased minimum sentences for some drug offenders with prior violent felony convictions. In this regard, the Act clearly distinguishfed] \u2018non-violent\u2019 drug offenders from offenders with a violent felony history\u201d (2009 NY Slip Op 50311[U], *7). Yet, defendant\u2019s construction of Penal Law \u00a7 70.70 \u201cwould have the DLRA apply . . . increased sentences for drug offenders with prior non-violent [foreign] felony convictions . . . , but, incongruously,\u201d not to offenders with prior violent foreign felony convictions <em>(id.). </em>Defendant suggests that the Legislature may have excluded foreign violent felony convictions from the ambit of section 70.70 so as \u201cto simplify the ofttimes complicated process of determining whether a foreign conviction qualifies as a New York violent felony.\u201d But figuring out whether a foreign conviction qualifies as a <em>non-violent </em>New York felony entails an arguably equally \u201ccomplicated process\u201d in many cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">Finally, our view of section 70.70 (4) is consistent with the Legislature\u2019s general sentencing design for recidivist offenders; specifically, article 70 is replete with provisions directing the use of foreign convictions as predicate offenses for purposes of enhancing sentences <em>(see </em>Penal Law \u00a7 70.04 [1] [b] [i] [second violent felony offender]; \u00a7 70.06 [1] [b] [i] [second felony offender]; \u00a7 70.07 [3] [second child sexual assault felony offender]; \u00a7 70.08 [1] [b] [persistent violent felony offender]; \u00a7 70.10 [1] [b] [persistent felony offender]; \u00a7 70.70 [1] [b]; \u00a7 70.71 [1] [b] [second felony drug offender]; \u00a7 70.80 [1] [c] [predicate felony sex offender]). As Supreme Court observed, to construe Penal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>Law \u00a7 70.70 in the manner advanced by defendant, \u201cone would have to believe that among all of the Penal Law provisions where a particular class of foreign convictions \u2018counts\u2019 in raising an offender\u2019s sentence,\u201d the Legislature without explanation and for no apparent reason singled out second felony drug offenders with prior out-of-state violent felony convictions \u201cfor more lenient treatment\u201d (2009 NY Slip Op 50311[U], *8).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">IL</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">An out-of-state felony conviction qualifies as a predicate felony under New York\u2019s sentencing statutes only if it is for a crime \u201cwhose elements are equivalent to those of a New York felony\u201d <em>(People v Gonzalez, </em>61 NY2d 586, 589 [1984]). \u201cAs a general rule, [the court\u2019s] inquiry is limited to a comparison of the crimes\u2019 elements as they are respectively defined in the foreign and New York penal statutes\u201d <em>(People v Muniz, 74 </em>NY2d 464, 467-468 [1989], <em>citing People v Olah, </em>300 NY 96, 98 [1949]). When a statute-to-statute comparison reveals differences in the elements such that it is possible to violate the foreign statute without engaging in conduct that is a felony in New York, the foreign statute may not serve as a predicate <em>(see Muniz, </em>74 NY2d at 469-470).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">And this is not a case where,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-8\">\u201c[a]s an exception to the <em>Olah </em>rule ... a sentencing court [may] go beyond the statute and scrutinize the accusatory instrument in the foreign jurisdiction [because] the statute renders criminal not one act but several acts which, if committed in New York, would in some cases be felonies and in others would constitute only misdemeanors\u201d <em>(Gonzalez, </em>61 NY2d at 590).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-9\">Indeed, we have remarked that where there are differences in the intent elements of the New York and out-of-state crimes, the trial court may not consider the recitals in the accusatory instrument underlying the foreign conviction when resolving a defendant\u2019s status as a predicate felon <em>(Muniz, </em>74 NY2d at 469-470; <em>see also Somerville v Conway, </em>281 F Supp 2d 515, 522 [ED NY 2003] [\u201cWhere the difference between the definition of the foreign crime and the New York crime turns on \u2018a particular aggravating circumstance\u2019 such as intent, recourse to the indictment is improper because the aggravating circumstance was not relevant to the defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence of the foreign crime\u201d (citing <em>Muniz)]). </em>Here, Supreme Court examined the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>indictment underlying defendant\u2019s robbery conviction in North Carolina so as to ascertain whether his intent, as a factual matter, satisfied New York\u2019s intent element for robbery. This was impermissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">Next, CPL 470.15 (1) bars the Appellate Division \u201cfrom affirming a judgment, sentence or order on a ground not decided <em>adversely </em>to the appellant by the trial court, and CPL 470.35 (1) grants us no broader review powers in this regard\u201d <em>(People v Concepcion, 17 </em>NY3d 192,195 [2011] [discussing <em>People v LaFontaine </em>(92 NY2d 470 [1998])]). As a result, we may not review Supreme Court\u2019s determination, which favored defendant, that the North Carolina robbery statute is broader than any New York felony. Finally, we have examined defendant\u2019s claims of error relating to Supreme Court\u2019s suppression rulings and consider them to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be modified by remitting to Supreme Court for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion and, as so modified, affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">Chief Judge Lippman and Judges Ciparick, Graffeo, Smith, Pigott and Jones concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">Order modified, etc.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
