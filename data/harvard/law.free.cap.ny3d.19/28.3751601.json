We hold that under the facts of this case, Nova has not demonstrated that discharge of its surety obligation is warranted. We also consider whether the School District is entitled to attorneys\u2019 fees expended in the prosecution of this litigation, and conclude that the request for attorneys\u2019 fees was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-8\">L</p>\n<p id=\"b109-9\">On December 26, 2003, the School District and defendant DJH Mechanical Associates, Inc. (DJH) contracted for DJH to perform heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) work at A.B. Davis Middle School for a price of $919,000. The contract mandated that the School District make progress payments to DJH based upon DJH\u2019s application for payment for work performed during the preceding calender month. The School District was permitted to terminate the contract if DJH, among other things, failed to furnish adequate assurance that DJH could complete the work.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-10\">The contract also required DJH to obtain a performance bond, which DJH secured from Nova, a compensated surety. The performance bond incorporates the terms of the underlying construction contract and provides that \u201c[t]he Surety shall not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>be liable to the Owner or others for obligations of the Contractor that are unrelated to the Construction Contract, and the Balance of the Contract Price shall not be reduced or set off on account of any such unrelated obligations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">As relevant to the School District\u2019s cross appeal, the contract between the School District and DJH further provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-6\">\u201cThe costs of finishing the Work include, without limitation, all reasonable attorney\u2019s fees, additional title costs, insurance, additional interest because of any delay in completing the Work, and all other direct and indirect and consequential damages incurred by the Owner by reason of the termination of the Contract as stated herein.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">The performance bond as it relates to legal costs provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-8\">\u201c[t]o the limit of the amount of this Bond, but subject to commitment by the Owner of the Balance of the Contract Price to mitigation of costs and damages on the Construction Contract, the Surety is obligated without duplication for: . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-9\">\u201c[ajdditional legal, design professional and delay costs resulting from the Contractor\u2019s Default, and resulting from the actions or failure to act of the Surety.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b110-10\">In June 2004, while the contract work was underway, the School District received a notice to withhold/release payment (notice of cross-withholding) from the Department of Labor (DOL). The notice stemmed from DOL\u2019s investigation of alleged prevailing wage violations by DJH on a previously performed public works project<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and requested that the School District withhold $863,197.40 in contract payments pending completion of the investigation. A November 2004 application summary indicates that DJH had submitted nine applications for progress payments. In January 2005, DOL gave the School District notice that it could release $649,197.40 to DJH, but directed the School District to send the balance of $214,000 to DOL in satisfaction of DJH\u2019s debt. The president of DJH signed a provision of the notice assigning to DOL $214,000 in earned progress payments. The School District subsequently remitted that amount to DOL. Work ostensibly progressed but at a very slow pace <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>and, in July 2006, the School District terminated its contract with DJH due to the contractor\u2019s failure to substantially complete the HVAC work. When the School District turned to Nova to perform under the bond and fund the work left remaining upon DJH\u2019s default, Nova disclaimed liability and refused to complete the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">The School District commenced this breach of contract action against Nova, seeking damages for the cost of completing the project and also attorneys\u2019 fees, and against DJH, seeking damages for its failure to complete the contracted-for work. DJH defaulted.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">Nova answered and moved for summary judgment, arguing, among other things, that the School District violated article 3-A of the Lien Law<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> by diverting $214,000 of trust fund assets reserved for completion of the HVAC work to satisfy debts incurred on the Mahopac project. Nova contended that but for the improper payment to DOL, the School District would have had sufficient funds to complete its HVAC project and Nova\u2019s surety obligation would not have been triggered. Nova further alleged that the School District breached the performance bond by \u201cillegally reducing the contract funds,\u201d thereby discharging Nova from its duty to perform. In response, the School District admitted that it released $214,000 to DOL upon DJH\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>authorization, and. asked the court to search the record to grant it partial summary judgment on the issue of Nova\u2019s liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">Supreme Court declined to grant either party summary judgment. In denying Nova\u2019s motion, the court observed that the instant case was distinguishable from <em>Matter of RLI Ins. Co., Sur. Div. v New York State Dept. of Labor </em>(97 NY2d 256 [2002]), where the surety had completed the project at issue and was therefore subrogated to the rights of article 3-A trust fund beneficiaries. The court stated that \u201cif Nova had undertaken to complete DJH\u2019s performance, it would have been subrogated to the rights of both Plaintiff and DJH, and if the $214,000.00 payment involved payment of underpaid wages on an unrelated job, Nova would have a claim against Plaintiff for improper diversion of trust assets\u201d (30 Misc 3d 1231 [A], 2008 NY Slip Op 52725[U], *11 [2008]). As Nova did not complete DJH\u2019s performance, it \u201ctherefore . . . has no right as a subrogee to unpaid contract . . . and trust fund monies\u201d <em>(id. </em>at *13). The court determined that questions of fact remained as to whether the payment to DOL was an improper diversion of trust fund assets and whether the payment violated the bond by increasing Nova\u2019s risk of liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">Both Nova and the School District appealed, and Supreme Court ordered bifurcated trials. The liability phase was tried before a jury in March 2009. The jury returned a verdict in the School District\u2019s favor, finding that DJH breached its contract with the School District by failing to complete its work and waived its right to terminate the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">The issues before Supreme Court post-trial were: (1) whether the School District\u2019s $214,000 payment to DOL relieved Nova of liability under the performance bond and (2) whether the School District could recover attorneys\u2019 fees for completing the project and prosecuting its claim in this litigation. Supreme Court held that the School District\u2019s payment to DOL did not excuse Nova\u2019s performance under the bond. The court again emphasized that Nova had not completed performance, and thus had \u201cno right as a subrogee to [the] unpaid Contract Price or any Trust Fund monies that were wrongfully diverted\u201d (30 Misc 3d 1233[A], 2009 NY Slip Op 52793[U], *11 [2009]). Supreme Court rejected Nova\u2019s argument that the payment violated the performance bond by increasing its liability, because the $214,000 at issue was due to DJH for its past performance. As the School District had not terminated its contract with DJH at the time of payment, the School District was permitted to pay DOL at DJH\u2019s request in lieu of paying DJH directly.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>With regard to the School District\u2019s claim for attorneys\u2019 fees, the court held that the bond allowed only for attorneys\u2019 fees incurred in the completion of the project, not for expenditures made in pursuit of this litigation. Quoting <em>United States Fid. &amp; Guar. Co. v Braspetro Oil Servs. Co. </em>(369 F3d 34, 77 [2d Cir 2004]), which Supreme Court found \u201chad a clause identical to\u201d the clause at issue here, it held that \u201c \u00a3[i]t was not unmistakably clear that the use of the term [\u00a3\u00a3]legal costs\u201d in the Bond[ ] was intended to obligate the Suret[y] to pay . . . attorneys\u2019 fees in litigation between the Suret[y] and the Obligee[ ] over the Bond[ ]\u2019 \u201d (2009 NY Slip Op 52793DJ], *14). The parties then stipulated to the amount of attorneys\u2019 fees owed for completion of the project, and Supreme Court entered judgment for a set sum in the amount of $121,940.16 in favor of the School District.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">Nova and the School District both appealed, and the Appellate Division affirmed <em>(see Mount Vernon City School Dist. v Nova Cas. Co., </em>78 AD3d 1028, 1029 [2d Dept 2010]). The court agreed that because \u201cNova was not a fully paying and performing surety ... it did not succeed to the rights of the owner or the Lien Law article 3-A trust beneficiaries\u201d <em>(id.). </em>Thus, the School District\u2019s allegedly improper payment did not allow Nova to avoid liability under the performance bond. The court further held that, \u201csince the $214,000 represented a sum earned by DJH as a progress payment under the contract, Nova failed to establish, as a matter of law,\u201d that the School District breached the performance bond <em>(id. </em>at 1030). Finally, the court concluded that \u201cneither the contract nor the performance bond contain unmistakably clear language obligating Nova to reimburse [the School District] for its attorney\u2019s fees in this litigation\u201d <em>(id. </em>[internal quotation marks and citation omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">We granted Nova\u2019s motion and the School District\u2019s cross motion for leave to appeal (16 NY3d 707 [2011]) and now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">IL</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">As a general rule, a surety may assert affirmative defenses to an obligee\u2019s claim of breach of contract based on the obligee\u2019s noncompliance with the terms of the performance bond or material alterations to the terms of the underlying contract <em>(see </em>23 Lord, Williston on Contracts \u00a7 61:31 [4th ed]; <em>Tishman Westwide Constr. LLC v ASF Glass, Inc., </em>33 AD3d 539, 540 [1st Dept 2006]). \u201cUnder general contract rules, an obligation may not be altered without the consent of the party who assumed the obligation. [As] [suretyship is a contractual relation . . . the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>[obligee] and the principal debtor may not alter the surety\u2019s undertaking to cover a different obligation without the surety\u2019s consent\u201d <em>(Bier Pension Plan Trust v Estate of Schneierson, </em>74 NY2d 312, 315 [1989]). Thus, where an obligee\u2014in the context of a construction contract, the owner\u2014materially alters the terms of the contract and increases the risks imposed on the surety by such acts as modifying the duties of the principal-contractor, extending the time for the principal\u2019s performance, or making overpayments or premature payments, the surety may be discharged <em>(see id,.; see also </em>Restatement [Third] of Suretyship &amp; Guaranty \u00a7 37 [l]-[3]; Egan, <em>Discharge of the Performance Bond Surety, </em>in Gallagher, Suretyship, at 12-1-12-3 [1993] [hereinafter Egan]).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">Though it was the early rule in New York that a surety obligation is <em>\u201cstrictissimi juris, </em>and [the surety] is discharged by any alteration of the contract. . . whether material or not, and . . . whether it is or is not to [the surety\u2019s] injury\u201d <em>(Page v Krekey, </em>137 NY 307, 314 [1893]), we have declined to apply the rule to compensated sureties in the context of construction contracts <em>(see St. John\u2019s Coll., Fordham v Aetna Indem. Co., </em>201 NY 335, 341-342 [1911], citing <em>Guaranty Co. v Pressed Brick Co., </em>191 US 416 [1903]; <em>see also </em>23 Lord, Williston on Contracts \u00a7 61:5 [4th ed] [\u201c(t)he corporate compensated surety is not favored with the solicitude shown the private, uncompensated surety\u201d]). In such a case, discharging the surety is in appropriate where the purported alteration cannot \u201cbe said to affect the surety adversely or to have any effect whatever upon the contract or the defendant\u2019s obligation\u201d <em>(St. John\u2019s Coll., Fordham </em>at 342; <em>see also </em>Egan, at 12-1 [\u201c(A) compensated surety is usually obligated to demonstrate affirmatively actual prejudice arising from the act of the obligee. In the absence of actual prejudice, the compensated surety usually remains bound\u201d]). It is incumbent on the surety seeking to be discharged to demonstrate that an obligee\u2019s act has so prejudiced it that its obligation is impaired <em>(see </em>Restatement [Third] of Suretyship &amp; Guaranty \u00a7 49).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">Here, Nova argues primarily that the School District\u2019s payment to DOL of $214,000 in contract funds violated the Lien Law, and that the improper diversion constituted a breach of contract, which substantially increased Nova\u2019s risk of loss on the performance bond. As such, Nova submits, it was discharged from its duty to perform. Reserving judgment on whether the payment indeed constituted a Lien Law violation, as that issue was not squarely decided by the courts below <em>(see </em>78 AD3d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>1030), we nonetheless conclude that any such violation would provide no grounds, on the record before us, for Nova\u2019s discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">Under article 3-A of the Lien Law, funds received by an owner and/or contractor in connection with a contract for a public improvement must be held in trust to ensure payment of trust beneficiaries, namely, subcontractors, architects, engineers, surveyors, laborers and materialmen, as well as payment of taxes and expenses incurred by the construction <em>(see </em>Lien Law \u00a7 70 [1]; \u00a7 71 [2]; <em>see also Caristo Constr. Corp. v Diners Fin. Corp., </em>21 NY2d 507, 512 [1968]). \u201c[0]nce a trust comes into existence, its funds may not be diverted for non-trust purposes [and] [u]se of trust assets for any purpose other than the expenditures authorized [by statute] . . . constitutes an improper diversion of trust assets, regardless of the propriety of the trustee\u2019s intentions\u201d <em>(Matter of RLI Ins. Co., Sur. Div. v New York State Dept. of Labor, </em>97 NY2d 256, 263 [2002], citing <em>Canron Corp. v City of New York, </em>89 NY2d 147, 154 [1996]; <em>see </em>Lien Law \u00a7 72). This \u201cprohibition against diversion of funds to purposes unrelated to a particular improvement was intended to eradicate the practice of \u2018pyramiding,\u2019 in which contractors use loans or payments advanced in the course of one project to complete another\u201d <em>(Matter of RLI, </em>97 NY2d at 264).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">However, whether the School District\u2019s payment of contract funds to DOL as DJH\u2019s assignee violated the Lien Law is irrelevant to Nova\u2019s surety obligation, because Nova did not perform by funding completion of the work upon DJH\u2019s default as required under the performance bond. As such, and as found by the courts below, it is not subrogated to the rights of the article 3-A trust beneficiaries as a completing surety and lacks capacity to raise any alleged violation of the Lien Law. This case is therefore wholly distinguishable from those cases on which Nova relies, where we allowed subrogees of trust beneficiaries to assert superior claims to trust assets and recognized their right to invoke the Lien Law to challenge wrongful diversions <em>(see Matter of RLI, </em>97 NY2d at 263-265 [surety that had completed construction of a public improvement project on behalf of a defaulting contractor had a right to funds still in possession of the project owner superior to a claim filed by DOL]; <em>Caristo, </em>21 NY2d at 510-511 [general contractor who, upon subcontractor\u2019s default, paid suppliers and other subcontractors pursuant to a payment bond was entitled to trust funds improperly diverted to the defendant factor]).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>Furthermore, Nova has not established that the payment adversely affected or, for that matter, had any effect whatsoever on its surety obligations. Nova repeats the conclusory assertion that its \u201closs on the Bond was substantially increased,\u201d but does not illustrate how or to what extent. Rather, Nova has contended that had the $214,000 not been remitted to DOL, those funds could have been applied to the cost of completion of the HVAC work. Yet, the $214,000 consisted of earned funds due to DJH for its past performance on the contract and, presumably, was already accounted for. The payment was neither in excess of what was owed nor made prematurely, both of which could have exposed Nova to a greater risk of loss <em>(see </em>Egan, at 12-3). In short, even assuming that the payment of $214,000 to DOL, rather than DJH, was an improper diversion, it does not appear that the payment committed Nova to a dollar more than that amount for which it bonded DJH. As the payment neither materially altered the contract nor impaired Nova\u2019s surety obligation, Nova\u2019s discharge is unwarranted <em>(see Becker v Faber, </em>280 NY 146, 152 [1939] [surety not discharged of \u201cthat part of the original obligation which still remains and <em>which remains untouched and </em>unaffected\u201d by-an act of the creditor]).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">The dissent opines that in so holding we \u201cfacilitate [ ] the School District\u2019s participation in [the] long-prohibited practice [of \u2018pyramiding\u2019]\u201d (dissenting op at 40). However, nothing we have said condones that practice or insulates the School District from any claims that may properly be asserted by an article 3-A trust beneficiary who, as a result of the School District\u2019s payment of contract funds to DOL, was left unpaid. We simply conclude that Nova, which bears the burden of establishing grounds for its discharge, has yet to show how its surety obligation was impaired. Even if, as the dissent concludes, \u201c[fit is difficult to fathom . . . [that] all trust claims had been paid\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 43), we cannot release Nova from the very obligation it contracted to undertake on a hunch. Nova did not demonstrate that the transfer of funds to DOL resulted in any workers, subcontractors or other article 3-A trust beneficiaries having unpaid claims for which the School District reimbursed them, or that such reimbursement was part of the damages claimed against Nova. Though the dissent finds that we \u201cfail[ ] to provide any explanation whatsoever regarding how the diversion of $214,000 that could have been applied toward the completion of the HVAC job did not harm the surety\u2019s interests\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 44), it is neither our, nor the School District\u2019s, burden to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>Nova also contends, however, that the School District breached the terms of the performance bond, which provided that \u201cthe Balance of the Contract Price shall not be reduced or set off on account of [DJH\u2019s] unrelated obligations.\u201d To be sure, the unpaid wage claim arising from the Mahopac project was an obligation unrelated to the contract between DJH and the School District. While the $214,000 payment to DOL ultimately satisfied that obligation, however, the School District owed that amount to DJH for completed work. Indeed, the record reflects that the $214,000 was a portion of a larger sum due to DJH based on the School District\u2019s approval of the contractor\u2019s fifth through ninth applications for progress payments. Thus, the contract price was not reduced or set off on account of DOL\u2019s notice of cross-withholding; rather, it was reduced incrementally in proportion to the work performed, as the contract prescribed.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">We thus conclude that the School District did not breach the terms of the performance bond, and that the alleged illegal diversion of trust funds did not excuse Nova\u2019s performance. As surety, Nova breached the performance bond by refusing to complete the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">m.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">On its cross appeal, the School District argues that the lower courts erred by declining to award the School District attorneys\u2019 fees that it incurred in the prosecution of this action because the construction contract and bond at issue provide for recovery of all attorneys\u2019 fees, and because Nova\u2019s breach occasioned the lawsuit. \u201cUnder the general rule, attorneys\u2019 fees and disbursements are incidents of litigation and the prevailing party may not collect them from the loser unless an award is authorized by agreement between the parties or by statute or court rule\u201d <em>(Matter of A.G. Ship Maintenance Corp. v Lezak, </em>69 NY2d 1, 5 [1986]). \u201c[T]he court should not infer a party\u2019s intention to waive the benefit of the rule unless the intention to do so is <em>unmistakably clear </em>from the language of the promise\u201d <em>(Hooper Assoc. v AGS Computers, </em>74 NY2d 487, 492 [1989] [emphasis added]; <em>see also United States Fid. &amp; Guar. Co. v Braspetro Oil Servs. Co., </em>369 F3d 34, 74 [2004]).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-8\">Here, paragraph 6 of the bond provides that Nova \u201cis obligated without duplication for\u201d \u201c[additional legal, design professional and delay costs resulting from the Contractor\u2019s Default, and resulting from [Nova\u2019s] actions or failure to act.\u201d The underlying construction contract, which is incorporated by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>reference into the performance bond, provides: \u201cThe costs of finishing the Work include, without limitation, <em>all reasonable attorney\u2019s fees, </em>additional title costs, insurance, additional interest because of any delay in completing the Work, and all other direct and indirect consequential damages incurred by the Owner <em>by reason of the termination of the </em>Contract\u201d (emphasis added). The School District contends that these dual provisions, and particularly the broad phrase \u201call reasonable attorney\u2019s fees,\u201d are inclusive of the expenditures made for purposes of this litigation. However, under a precise reading of the contractual language, which our rule requires, the disputed fees are outside the scope of the agreements, because they were not incurred as a result of the termination of the construction contract, but rather as a result of Nova\u2019s breach of its surety obligation. Given the lack of \u201cunmistakably clear\u201d language indicating an intent to provide for an award of attorneys\u2019 fees incurred in litigation arising out of Nova\u2019s failure to perform, the School District\u2019s request for attorneys\u2019 fees must be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, without costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b110-11\">.

Because the majority facilitates the Mount Vernon City School District\u2019s (the School District) participation in this long-prohibited practice and inexplicably ignores the surety\u2019s right to be discharged from the performance bond where the School District breached the bond,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> thereby depriving the surety of the benefit of its bargain under basic contract principles, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>We have explained that \u201c[i]n the case of a contractor, the so-called trust fund provisions of the Lien Law prohibit [ ] diversion, to purposes unrelated to a particular improvement, of contract payments from the owner which were intended to pay the expense of that improvement, including the cost of labor and materials\u201d <em>(Aquilino v United States of Am., </em>10 NY2d 271, 275 [1961] [discussing the predecessor to the current version of article 3-A]). In the same spirit, the successor and current provision, article 3-A\u2019s prohibition on diverting trust fund assets serves the \u201cremedial purpose of \u2018 \u201cinsuring] that funds obtained for financing of an improvement of real property and <em>moneys earned in the performance of a contract for . . . [an] improvement will in fact be used to pay the costs of that improvement\u201d </em>\u2019 \u201d <em>(Matter of RLI Ins. Co., Sur. Div. v New York State Dept. of Labor, </em>97 NY2d 256, 263 [2002] [citations omitted and emphasis added]). The School District clearly thwarted the purpose of this rule by ensuring that the money earned in the performance of the heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) contract would be used to pay the costs of the Mahopac School District project.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">Although a school district following the direction of the Department of Labor (DOL) may seem to be cast in a more sympathetic light than a surety seeking to disclaim liability for completing a project upon the default of a construction company, the majority misapprehends the nature of the Lien Law. As the majority acknowledges, it is of no import that the School District may have thought it was acting properly in following the directive of the DOL, because the rule prohibiting diversions of trust assets applies regardless of the intentions of the diverter <em>(see RLI, </em>97 NY2d at 263). Additionally, while the majority properly acknowledges the surety\u2019s rights to discharge under certain circumstances <em>{see </em>majority op at 36), it ignores that such circumstances arose in this case, triggering these rights, and concludes that the surety here was not entitled to discharge and was responsible for completion of the HVAC job.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">Lien Law \u00a7 72 (1) provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-7\">\u201c[a]ny transaction by which any trust asset is paid, transferred or applied for any purpose other than a purpose of the trust . . . before payment or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>discharge of all trust claims with respect to the trust, is a diversion of trust assets, whether or not there are trust claims in existence at the time of the transaction, and if the diversion occurs by the voluntary act of the trustee or by his consent such act or consent is a breach of trust.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">\u201cOnly after all trust claims have been paid or discharged does a beneficial interest in the remaining balance vest in the trustee owner or contractor\u201d (RLI, 97 NY2d at 263). In <em>Kemper Ins. Cos. v State of New York (70 </em>AD3d 192, 196 [3d Dept 2009]), the court held in favor of the surety where the contractor defaulted and the State, having responded to an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) notice of levy by paying contract funds to the IRS in satisfaction of the contractor\u2019s outstanding tax obligations, rendered the remaining trust funds insufficient to pay for the completion of the project. Just like the contractor in <em>Kemper, </em>DJH \u201c[did] not have a sufficient beneficial interest in the moneys, due or to become due . . . under the contract, to give [it] a property right in them, except for whatever balance, if any, might later remain after all claims had been paid,\u201d and the School District was not entitled to send the $214,000 anywhere other than for use on the HVAC project <em>(id. </em>at 197 [internal quotation marks and citations omitted]). When the surety in <em>Kemper </em>completed the job, the State\u2019s payment \u201cdid not include the sum that had been turned over to the IRS, and the funds paid were insufficient to complete the work and cover [the surety\u2019s] payments to laborers, suppliers, and others under the payment bonds, causing [the surety] to suffer a loss\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 194). That the surety in this case did not complete the HVAC project makes no difference. The same principle applies here; when the School District made the payment to the DOL, Nova\u2019s risk of suffering a loss increased and it was therefore relieved of its obligations. It makes little sense to require a surety to complete a job when it is fully aware that the project owner has already diverted (in this case nearly a quarter of the total) funds designated to pay for the project, in violation of the Lien Law, and there is a very real possibility that the surety would suffer a loss if it were to complete the job.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">Here, the School District has most recently claimed that the payment of $214,000 to DOL was not a diversion of trust assets because all claims had been paid. Nowhere in the School District\u2019s briefs to this Court is this argument mentioned. Rather, the School District argued that the \u201cpayment of the subject funds was for a <em>trust </em>purpose\u2014to pay for work performed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>by DJH on the School\u2019s project,\u201d and accused the surety of \u201c[trying] relentlessly to spin the [School District\u2019s] payment ... as one for non-trust purposes, arguing that because the payment was apparently used by <em>DJH </em>and the <em>DOL </em>for a purportedly unrelated project it was, allegedly, for a non-trust purpose.\u201d Then, at oral argument, the School District abruptly abandoned that view and partially adopted the surety\u2019s position (which it had decried in its brief) that the funds were used for a non-trust purpose. The School District argued that all trust claims had been paid at the time the payment to DOL was made, and that DJH was free to spend those funds as it pleased, thereby implying that the funds were indeed used for a non-trust purpose, but that such use was allowed under the circumstances. The School District has either been unable or unwilling to commit to one of these two contradictory positions and that is because neither is reasonable. The majority saves the School District from its \u201cflip-flopping\u201d by concluding erroneously that \u201cwhether the School District\u2019s payment of contract funds to DOL as DJH\u2019s assignee violated the Lien Law is irrelevant to Nova\u2019s surety obligation\u201d (majority op at 37). It is difficult to fathom, however, that with respect to the incomplete HVAC project, all trust claims had been paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">Contrary to the majority\u2019s view (that the violation of the Lien Law is \u201cirrelevant\u201d) the School District\u2019s violation of the Lien Law matters, and it matters a great deal. The majority first acknowledges that a surety is not obligated to complete a construction job if it can demonstrate that it has a right to discharge due to the actions of another party, then inexplicably goes on to state that Nova has no right to rely on the School District\u2019s violation of the Lien Law as a basis for discharge because it is not a completing surety. But Nova does not claim that it is \u201csubrogated to the rights of the article 3-A trust beneficiaries as a completing surety\u201d <em>(see </em>majority op at 37), nor does it argue that it has the same rights as a completing surety, and it certainly does not \u201clack[ ] capacity to raise any alleged violation of the Lien Law\u201d <em>(id. ) </em>as the majority suggests. Rather, Nova simply asserts, and rightly so, that it has the same rights as any other surety\u2014rights that are enforceable well before any possibility of completion arises. Nova was no longer under any obligation to complete the HVAC project once the School District illegally diverted the funds to the DOL. Nova is, of course, entitled to raise the issue insofar as it supports Nova\u2019s legitimate breach of contract defense that, in making the payment, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>the School District breached the performance bond and discharged Nova from its obligation to complete the project upon DJH\u2019s default.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">The Lien Law violation is highly relevant, especially where, as here, the performance bond contains a provision in essence prohibiting diversions of trust fund assets. The plain language of the performance bond demonstrates that the surety sought to insulate itself from \u201cobligations of the Contractor that are unrelated to the Construction Contract.\u201d That language is unambiguous and should be enforced. That the $214,000 was earned as a progress payment does not render the diversion any less a violation of the performance bond\u2019s prohibition on reducing or setting off the balance of the contract price for any of DJH\u2019s unrelated obligations. The majority is under the impression that because the funds paid were earned (and therefore did not represent prepayment or overpayment of contract funds) the performance bond was not violated. However, prepayment and overpayment are simply examples of actions that would have violated the School District\u2019s obligations to the surety. They are not the <em>only </em>actions that would entitle the surety to discharge.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Indeed, the majority fails to provide any explanation whatsoever regarding how the diversion of $214,000 that could have been applied toward the completion of the HVAC job did not harm the surety\u2019s interests and did not violate the performance bond. By sending the funds elsewhere, the School District certainly satisfied DOL\u2019s request but it also made it impossible for those funds to be used to complete the HVAC project, thereby increasing the risk that DJH would run out of money prior to finishing the job. The School District was not entitled, after having increased the risk of DJH\u2019s default, to then recover from the surety on a breach of contract theory. As I cannot agree with the majority\u2019s reasoning that Nova has not demonstrated its entitlement to be discharged from its obligations under the performance bond which the School District breached, I respectfully dissent and would modify the Appellate Division\u2019s order to dismiss the School District\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>Judges Graffeo, Read, Smith and Pigott concur with Judge Cipajrick; Chief Judge Lippman dissents in part in a separate opinion in which Judge Jones concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">Order affirmed, without costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b118-7\">.
