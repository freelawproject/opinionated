We conclude that petitioner is entitled to a hearing before the Department may place such letter in his permanent file.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">Petitioner has been employed as a firefighter with the Department since 2003. On January 22, 2006, petitioner and Russell Harris, an emergency medicad technician with the Department, separately responded to the scene of a motor vehicle accident in Brooklyn. There, Harris alleges that petitioner assaulted him and yelled a racial epithet at him. In response, Harris filed a police report and notified a supervisor. A lieutenant at Harris\u2019 station prepared an Unusual Occurrence Report (UOR) describing the purported incident and identifying potential witnesses. Based upon this UOR, the Department\u2019s Bureau of Investigations and Trials (BIT) initiated an internal investigation.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">Three days later, Harris lodged a complaint with the Department\u2019s EEO office and a two-year investigation ensued. During this time, the EEO office notified petitioner of the complaint and interviewed him. The EEO office also questioned other personnel present at the time of the alleged incident, including individuals named by petitioner. At the conclusion of the investigation, the EEO office found that the evidence substantiated Harris\u2019 allegations that petitioner made an inappropriate racial slur.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">An attorney with the EEO office prepared a report summarizing the findings of its investigation and furnished it to the Assistant Commissioner of the Department. In turn, the Assistant Commissioner submitted her own report to the Department\u2019s Commissioner, detailing the determination of the EEO office and recommending that petitioner receive additional EEO training and that he \u201csign and acknowledge an Advisory Memorandum regarding the rights and responsibilities\u201d of an employee with the Department. Upon review, the Commissioner approved this recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-8\">Accordingly, by letter dated June 5, 2008, the Assistant Commissioner informed petitioner that the EEO office had determined he \u201cexercised unprofessional conduct and made an offensive racial statement\u201d in connection with the complaint filed against him by Harris. The letter instructed him to read and sign the attached Advisory Memorandum and advised him that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>he would receive further EEO training at a future date. The Commissioner characterized the letter to petitioner \u201cas a formal Notice of Disposition of the filed Complaint.\u201d The letter was subsequently placed in petitioner\u2019s permanent EEO file.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">Petitioner objected to the placement of this letter in his EEO file contending that the Department denied him due process in that he had no opportunity to confront and cross-examine witnesses or present witnesses on his own behalf. On September 29, 2008, petitioner commenced this CPLR article 78 proceeding, requesting Supreme Court, among other things, to annul the Department\u2019s determination that petitioner made racially offensive remarks to Harris. Petitioner further sought the court to direct the Department to provide petitioner with a hearing on the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">By order entered on December 10, 2009, Supreme Court annulled the Department\u2019s determination and expunged the Assistant Commissioner\u2019s letter from petitioner\u2019s EEO file. The court concluded that \u201cthe letter [was] a disciplinary reprimand and not a critical evaluation\u201d and, therefore, petitioner had the right to a formal hearing and other due process safeguards. Supreme Court further observed that it could not order a hearing because, as the parties conceded, the applicable statute of limitations for conducting a hearing had expired. The Appellate Division affirmed the order of Supreme Court, similarly concluding that the Department did not \u201ccomport[ ] with the requirements of due process\u201d <em>(Matter of D\u2019Angelo v Scopetta, </em>81 AD3d 820, 821 [2d Dept 2011]). We granted the Department leave to appeal (17 NY3d 710 [2011]) and now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-7\">Our analysis begins with section 15-113 of the Administrative Code, which relates to discipline and removal procedures for members of the Department <em>(see generally Matter of Von Essen v New York City Civ. Serv. Commn., 4 </em>NY3d 220, 223-224 [2005]). The statute provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-8\">\u201c[t]he commissioner shall have power, in his or her discretion on conviction of a member of the force of any legal offense or neglect of duty, or violation of rules, or neglect or disobedience of orders or incapacity ... or immoral conduct, or conduct unbecoming an officer or member, or other breach of discipline, to punish the offending party by reprimand ... or dismissal from the force\u201d (Administrative Code \u00a7 15-113).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AFT\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number><em>In Matter of Tiernan v Walsh </em>(294 NY 299 [1945]), we examined this statute, then section 487a-12.0 of the Administrative Code, and concluded that \u201cthe phrase \u2018on conviction\u2019 . . . imports a trial or hearing as a necessary incident to a disciplinary proceeding\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 304).</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">The Department does not dispute that Administrative Code \u00a7 15-113 requires a hearing before its members are subject to punishment by reprimand. Rather, the Department argues that a hearing was not necessary in this case because the letter it placed in petitioner\u2019s permanent EEC file was not a formal reprimand but merely a critical evaluation not subject to the same due process protections. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">In that regard, our decision in <em>Holt v Board of Educ. of Webutuck Cent. School Dist. </em>(52 NY2d 625 [1981]) is instructive. There, two tenured teachers commenced separate proceedings against their respective school districts after school administrators placed letters in their permanent files criticizing their performance without conducting a hearing pursuant to section 3020-a of the Education Law. In the first case, school administrators issued the teacher two letters, one admonishing him for failing to maintain an orderly classroom after he had been directed to do so and the other scolding him for interrupting the class of another <em>(see id. </em>at 629-630). The letters described the teacher as incompetent, insubordinate and unbecoming <em>(see id. </em>at 629-630). In the second case, a school administrator sent the teacher one letter warning him that his regular absences from his assigned duties violated school policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-7\">We concluded these letters did not trigger the due process protections of Education Law \u00a7 3020-a because they were simply \u201ccritical evaluations\u201d and not \u201cformal reprimand[s]\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 633). Although we acknowledged that the letters at issue were \u201csharply critical,\u201d we observed that the fundamental purpose of these communications was not to punish but to identify \u201ca relatively minor breach of school policy and to encourage compliance with that policy in the future\u201d <em>(id.). </em>We further noted that individual school administrators issued these letters and that neither teacher was subject to an investigation conducted by the board of education. Thus, we opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-8\">\u201c[w]hile the inclusion of such letters in the teacher\u2019s permanent file may have some effect on his future advancement or potential employability elsewhere, it is by no means as damaging as a formal reprimand <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>issued by the board of education as the result of a determination of misconduct made by an impartial hearing panel. Each letter represents one administrator\u2019s view, not a formal finding of misconduct\u201d <em>(id.).</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">The facts in this case are readily distinguishable from the facts in <em>Holt. </em>To begin, petitioner here did not merely receive a letter from an immediate supervisor criticizing his performance. Rather, petitioner was the subject of a formal investigation conducted by the Department\u2019s EEO office in response to the complaint that he directed racially offensive language at Harris. That investigation, which took place over a two-year period, involved the interviewing of several eyewitnesses including the complainant and petitioner. After completing these interviews, the EEO office determined that the evidence they collected substantiated Harris\u2019 complaint and, as a result, they supplied a detailed report to the Assistant Commissioner. In turn, the Assistant Commissioner reviewed the EEO office\u2019s findings and then conferred with the Commissioner himself who ultimately approved the EEO office\u2019s determination. Thus, the letter in this case stands in contrast to the letters in <em>Holt, </em>which only reflect the views of a particular supervisor <em>(see </em>52 NY2d at 633).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-7\">Second, there is no way to characterize the determination that petitioner directed a racial epithet at Harris as a \u201cminor breach\u201d of the Department\u2019s EEO policy. The letter clearly reflects the serious nature of the Department\u2019s investigation of the complaint. The Assistant Commissioner wrote the letter to petitioner and noted that such document \u201cserve[d] as a formal Notice of Disposition of the filed Complaint.\u201d The letter, in no uncertain terms, informs petitioner that a thorough investigation revealed that he \u201cexercised unprofessional conduct\u201d and \u201cmade an offensive racial statement.\u201d The letter further advises petitioner that, as a consequence of his misconduct, he was required to review and sign an EEO Advisory Memorandum and participate in further EEO training. On that note, we agree with petitioner that the requirement to participate in additional EEO training is a form of discipline and not, as the Department contends, mere encouragement to comply with EEO policy <em>(cf. Holt, </em>52 NY2d at 633). Moreover, as the Department conceded at oral arguments, the EEO\u2019s finding that petitioner was in breach of its racial discrimination policy is serious misconduct that could negatively impact his eligibility for future promotion.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-8\">In sum, we conclude that the letter issued to petitioner constitutes a formal reprimand under Administrative Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>\u00a7 15-113. Because the Department denied petitioner his right to due process by placing the letter in his file without conducting a hearing, the letter was properly expunged from petitioner\u2019s permanent EEO file.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b744-9\"> Neither the police nor BIT ultimately took any action against petitioner.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b748-6\">Smith, J. (dissenting).</author>\n<p id=\"ASZ\">I dissent because I do not think the Assistant Commissioner\u2019s letter to petitioner is a \u201creprimand\u201d as we interpreted that term in <em>Holt v Board of Educ. of Webutuck Cent. School Dist. </em>(52 NY2d 625 [1981]).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-7\">Laws governing the discipline of civil servants, including Administrative Code of the City of New York \u00a7 15-113, often require a trial or hearing, with due process protections, before an employee can be given a \u201creprimand.\u201d If that term were given a broad interpretation, it could make the lives of public employers almost impossible: They would have to go through a proceeding before a neutral factfinder, with witnesses and cross-examination, every time they wanted to say a harsh word to an employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-8\">In recognition of this problem, we interpreted \u201creprimand\u201d narrowly in <em>Holt, </em>to include only a \u201cformal reprimand\u201d (52 NY2d at 633). One of the documents before us in <em>Holt </em>was a letter from a district principal to a schoolteacher, placed in the teacher\u2019s personnel file, that said the teacher had been \u201cinsubordinate\u201d and behaved in a way \u201cunbecoming of a teacher\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 630). We held that this letter, and a somewhat similar letter involved in a companion case, were not reprimands within the meaning of the statute but only \u201ccritical evaluations\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 633). The purpose of the letters, we said, was \u201cto warn, and hopefully to instruct\u2014not to punish\u201d <em>(id.). </em>We added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-9\">\u201cWhile the inclusion of such letters in the teacher\u2019s permanent file may have some effect on his future advancement or potential employability elsewhere, it is by no means as damaging as a formal reprimand issued by the board of education as the result of a determination of misconduct made by an impartial hearing panel. Each letter represents one administrator\u2019s view, not a formal finding of misconduct\u201d <em>(id.).</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b748-10\">I see no essential difference between the letter in this case and the letter in <em>Holt. </em>The letter here, which said that petitioner \u201cexercised unprofessional conduct and made an offensive racial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>statement\u201d does not seem materially harsher in its language than the letter at issue in <em>Holt. </em>It is true, as the majority emphasizes (majority op at 669), that the letter in this case was preceded by a more elaborate investigation than the <em>Holt </em>letter. On the other hand, the letter here made its \u201cpurpose to warn, and . . . instruct\u2014not to punish\u201d clearer than the <em>Holt </em>letter did: The letter in this case enclosed an \u201cEEO Advisory Memorandum\u201d for petitioner to review and informed him that he would be receiving \u201cEEO Training.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">As I interpret <em>Holt, </em>it allows public employers broad discretion to convene or not to convene \u201can impartial hearing panel\u201d to make a \u201cdetermination of misconduct\u201d justifying the issuance of a \u201cformal reprimand.\u201d The formality of that procedure in itself, as <em>Holt </em>explained, significantly increases the damage done by the reprimand to an employee\u2019s career. Employers should not be deterred from choosing, where they think it wise, a less formal and less damaging means of communicating their displeasure with an employee\u2019s conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">The Appellate Division decision in <em>Matter of Civil Serv. Empls. Assn. v Southold Union Free School Dist. </em>(204 AD2d 445 [2d Dept 1994]), assuming that it is correctly decided, is distinguishable. The critical document in that case was explicitly \u201cdesignated a \u2018formal reprimand\u2019 \u201d <em>(id. </em>at 445). <em>Southold </em>thus stands for the proposition when an employer seeks the impact that the words \u201cformal reprimand\u201d impart, it must invoke the formal procedures required by civil service legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-7\">I would accordingly reverse the Appellate Division\u2019s order and dismiss the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-8\">Chief Judge Lippman and Judges Graffeo, Read, Pigott and Jones concur with Judge Ciparick; Judge Smith dissents and votes to reverse in a separate opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-9\">Order affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
