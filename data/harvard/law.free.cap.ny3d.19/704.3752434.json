We conclude that under the circumstances of this case the term is ambiguous, precluding summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">Plaintiffs Douglas and Joanna Dean entered into a contract to purchase a home in Irvington in February 2005. The closing was scheduled to take place on March 31, 2005. Plaintiffs acquired a homeowners\u2019 insurance policy from defendant Tower Insurance Company of New York (Tower) effective as of the closing date. The closing was delayed until May 20, 2005. After the closing, plaintiffs discovered extensive termite damage to the house. Douglas Dean, with the help of family and friends, began the process of repairing the damage. Work on the house progressed over the course of the year following the closing, and the policy was renewed in March 2006. The renovations were substantially completed when, on May 15, 2006, a fire completely destroyed the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-7\">The morning after the fire, plaintiffs gave notice to Tower. On June 22, 2006, Tower disclaimed coverage on the ground that \u201c[o]ur investigation revealed the dwelling was unoccupied at the time of the loss. Accordingly, this dwelling does not qualify as a \u2018residence premises\u2019 [sic] there is no coverage for this claim under your policy.\u201d Secondarily, Tower disclaimed coverage on the ground that plaintiffs engaged in fraud by misrepresenting their intent to live in the premises on the application submitted in advance of acquiring the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-8\">The Tower policy provides as follows: \u201cWe cover: 1. The dwelling on the \u2018residence premises\u2019 shown in the Declarations, including structures attached to the dwelling.\u201d In the definitions section, \u201cresidence premises\u201d is defined as: \u201cThe one family dwelling . . . where you reside.\u201d The term reside is not defined in the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-9\">Plaintiffs commenced this action for breach of the insurance contract. Following discovery, both parties moved for summary judgment. Supreme Court granted Tower\u2019s motion, denied plaintiffs\u2019 motion and dismissed the complaint. The court held that the term \u201creside\u201d is clear and unambiguous, and that plaintiffs never established residency at the premises and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>\u201c[a]t best . . . established ownership of the house and presence in it to perform certain renovations, and a stated intent of living there\u201d (2010 NY Slip Op 31107[U], *9 [2010]). The Appellate Division modified the order of Supreme Court, finding that Tower failed to satisfy its prima facie burden on a motion for summary judgment <em>(see Dean v Tower Ins. Co. of N.Y., </em>84 AD3d 499 [1st Dept 2011]). It concluded that the \u201cresidence premises\u201d requirement in the policy failed to define what qualifies \u201cas \u2018resides\u2019 for the purpose of attaching coverage\u201d and that the \u201cpolicy [was] ambiguous in the circumstances of this case\u201d and otherwise denied summary judgment <em>(id. </em>at 499-500). The Appellate Division granted Tower leave to appeal to this Court on a certified question (2011 NY Slip Op 82928[U] [2011]). We agree with the Appellate Division and now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">\u201cInsurance contracts must be interpreted according to common speech and consistent with the reasonable expectation of the average insured\u201d <em>(Cragg v Allstate Indem. Corp., </em>17 NY3d 118, 122 [2011]). \u201c[B]efore an insurance company is permitted to avoid policy coverage, it must satisfy the burden which it bears of establishing that the exclusions or exemptions apply in the particular case, and that they are subject to no other reasonable interpretation\u201d <em>(Seaboard Sur. Co. v Gillette Co., </em>64 NY2d 304, 311 [1984] [citations omitted]). \u201c[A]mbiguities in an insurance policy are to be construed against the insurer\u201d <em>(Breed v Insurance Co. of N. Am., </em>46 NY2d 351, 353 [1978]).</p>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">\u201cThe standard for determining residency for purposes of insurance coverage requires something more than temporary or physical presence and requires at least some degree of permanence and intention to remain\u201d <em>(Government Empls. Ins. Co. v Paolicelli, </em>303 AD2d 633, 633 [2d Dept 2003] [internal quotation marks omitted]; <em>see also Matter of Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. v Gutstein, 80 </em>NY2d 773, 775 [1992]; <em>Matter of Allstate Ins. Co. [Rapp], </em>7 AD3d 302, 303 [1st Dept 2004]). Plaintiff Douglas Dean claimed that between the date of the closing and the date of the fire he was generally at the property at least five days a week. He would go there after work between 4:00 and 5:00 p.m. and leave no earlier than 10:00 p.m. and would frequently stay late into the night or early morning. He also averred that he had built a table for eating purposes and would eat at the house everyday, sometimes with other workers, and that he slept there on several occasions. Therefore, there are issues of fact as to whether Douglas\u2019 daily presence in the house, coupled with his intent to eventually move in with his family, is sufficient to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>satisfy the insurance policy\u2019s requirements <em>(cf. Vela v Tower Ins. Co. of N.Y., </em>83 AD3d 1050, 1051 [2d Dept 2011], <em>lv granted </em>2011 NY Slip Op 85357[U] [2d Dept 2011], <em>appeal withdrawn </em>18 NY3d 881 [2012]).</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">Further, because the term \u201creside\u201d is not defined in the contract making the term \u201cresidence premises\u201d ambiguous, it is arguable that the reasonable expectation of an average insured <em>(see Cragg, </em>17 NY3d at 122) is that occupancy of the premises would satisfy the policy\u2019s requirements. Notably, the standard fire policy as provided in Insurance Law \u00a7 3404 (e) speaks in terms of occupancy, and Insurance Law \u00a7 3404 (f) (1) (A) states that a policy \u201cwith respect to the peril of fire\u201d cannot contain provisions \u201cless favorable to the insured than those contained in the standard fire policy.\u201d Additionally, Tower\u2019s letter disclaiming coverage also speaks in terms of occupancy.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Courts have held that \u201c[a] householder need not necessarily have conventional, or, indeed, any furniture in a house to occupy it. His presence in it for sleeping and eating and working purposes can literally constitute occupancy. He can, if he will, sleep and eat on the floor or on improvised devices\u201d <em>(Page v Nationwide Mut. Fire Ins. Co., </em>15 AD2d 306, 307 [3d Dept 1962]; <em>see also Perrotta v Middlesex Mut. Ins. Co., </em>37 AD2d 783, 783 [2d Dept 1971]). Thus, there are issues of fact rendering summary judgment inappropriate in this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, with costs, and the certified question answered in the affirmative.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b787-8\"> While not determinative, the disclaimer letter is indicative that the reasonable expectation of an average insured, under these facts, is that occupancy is sufficient to establish coverage.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b787-7\">Jones, J. (dissenting).</author>\n<p id=\"AAM\">The homeowners\u2019 policy at issue on this appeal provides coverage for a \u201cresidence premises\u201d which is defined as the \u201cfamily dwelling, other structures, and grounds,\u201d or \u201c[t]hat part of any . . . building . . . where you reside.\u201d Thus, the proper inquiry is whether plaintiffs resided at the subject premises\u2014an outcome predicated on the simple application of the plain meaning of the term \u201creside\u201d to the policy. The majority declines to do so, however, agreeing with the Appellate Division that the absence of an express definition of \u201creside,\u201d coupled with plaintiffs\u2019 tendered proof that they were engaged in daily renovations inside the premises, renders the phrase \u201cresidence premises\u201d ambiguous and precludes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>Tower\u2019s entitlement to summary judgment. In my view, plaintiffs\u2019 activity falls short of demonstrating the physical permanence needed to establish that the subject property was their residence. Therefore, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">\u201cThe standard for determining residency for insurance coverage requires something more than temporary or physical presence and ... at least some degree of permanence and intention to remain\u201d <em>(Matter of Allstate Ins. Co. [Rapp], </em>7 AD3d 302, 303 [1st Dept 2004], quoting <em>Government Empls. Ins. Co. v Paolicelli, </em>303 AD2d 633, 633 [2d Dept 2003] [internal quotation marks omitted]). A resident is defined as \u201cone who lives in the household with a certain degree of permanency and intention to remain\u201d <em>(id., </em>quoting <em>Canfield v Peerless Ins. Co., </em>262 AD2d 934, 934-935 [4th Dept 1999]).</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">Applying the plain definition of \u201creside\u201d to the policy, it is evident that plaintiffs had not established the property as a \u201cresidence premises.\u201d Plaintiff Douglas Dean attested that leading up to the date of the fire, he would enter the property at least five days a week to perform renovation work, occasionally staying until late night or early morning. Although he ate meals and napped in the premises, significantly, he never stayed overnight and always returned to plaintiffs\u2019 residence of the previous seven years. Indeed, plaintiffs continued to reside in their previous home and, put simply, failed to physically move into the subject premises. Thus, Douglas Dean\u2019s testimony demonstrates ownership, an intention to reside at the subject premises, and recurrent presence inside the property for the purpose of renovation, but not the necessary \u201cdegree of permanence\u201d to establish a residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-7\">Inexplicably, the majority declines to apply the plain meaning of the term \u201creside\u201d when we have previously accorded unambiguous terms within insurance policies their plain and ordinary meaning <em>(see Government Empls. Ins. Co. v Kligler, </em>42 NY2d 863, 864 [1977] [\u201cWhile it is true that policies of insurance are to be construed liberally in favor of the insured and strictly against the insurer, where the provisions of the policy are clear and unambiguous, they must be given their plain and ordinary meaning, and courts should refrain from rewriting the agreement\u201d]; <em>New England Mut. Life Ins. Co. v Doe, </em>93 NY2d 122, 130 [1999] [Court applied the plain meaning to the term \u201cexist,\u201d noting that \u201c[e]xist means exist\u201d]; <em>Vigilant Ins. Co. v Bear Stearns Cos., Inc., </em>10 NY3d 170, 177 [2008]; <em>White v Continental Cas. Co., </em>9 NY3d 264, 267 [2007]). Instead, by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>finding an ambiguity with the term \u201cresidence premises,\u201d the majority argues that the case should turn on the issue of \u201coccupancy\u201d because \u201cit is arguable that the reasonable expectation of an average insured is that occupancy of the premises would satisfy the policy\u2019s requirements\u201d (majority op at 709 [citation omitted]). The majority appears to take particular issue with Tower\u2019s disclaimer letter which stated: \u201cOur investigation revealed the dwelling was unoccupied at the time of the loss. Accordingly, this dwelling does not qualify as a \u2018residence premises\u2019 [sic] there is no coverage for this claim under your policy.\u201d It is evident, however, that Tower disclaimed coverage on the ground that \u201cthis dwelling does not qualify as a \u2018residence premises\u2019 \u201d because it was not occupied in a manner that established the property as a residence. The terms \u201creside\u201d and \u201coccupy\u201d should not be conflated to circumvent the governing terms of the policy, notwithstanding the reference to \u201coccupancy\u201d in the disclaimer letter and Insurance Law \u00a7 3404 (e).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The issue is plainly whether the property was a \u201cresidence premises\u201d and Tower amply demonstrated its entitlement to judgment as a matter of law <em>(see Vela v Tower Ins. Co. of N.Y., </em>83 AD3d 1050 [2d Dept 2011]; <em>Marshall v Tower Ins. Co. of N.Y., </em>44 AD3d 1014 [2d Dept 2007]; <em>Commisso v Tower Ins. Co. of N.Y., </em>30 Misc 3d 1224[A], 2011 NY Slip Op 50190[U] [Sup Ct, NY County 2011]). Because plaintiffs\u2019 evidence failed to raise a triable issue of fact, I would reverse the order of the Appellate Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">Chief Judge Lippman and Judges Graffeo and Pigott concur with Judge Ciparick; Judge Jones dissents and votes to reverse in a separate opinion in which Judges Read and Smith concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">Order affirmed, with costs, and certified question answered in the affirmative.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b789-7\"> It is arguable whether plaintiffs even established occupancy (see <em>Page v Nationwide Mut.
