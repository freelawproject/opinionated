Defendant appeals as of right, and we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">On November 13, 2006, the body of Darrell McDonald was discovered in his apartment. McDonald\u2019s wrists had been bound with brown extension cords and tied to his ankles with black coaxial cable, and a sock had been stuffed in his mouth. McDonald had suffered a total of 32 stab wounds to his chest and abdomen, numerous cuts on his hands, and three incised wounds to the neck. McDonald had last been seen at the apartment of one of his friends where there were several other people, including defendant and his friend Bradley Starnes.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">Defendant first argues that the trial court erred by excluding the contents of a letter from Starnes to witness Kyle Remer. Defense counsel asked Remer on cross-examination about the contents of a letter he received from Starnes while both were in jail. Defendant was specifically interested in a single statement in the letter, in which Starnes told Remer, \u201cHey, do whatever it takes to get yourself out of trouble.\u201d The prosecution objected, and the trial court ruled that the jury could consider the fact that Remer received the letter but not the contents. Defendant argues that the trial court\u2019s decision to exclude the contents of the letter deprived him of the right to present a defense. A trial court\u2019s decision to admit or exclude evidence is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>People v Aldrich, </em>246 Mich App 101, 113; 631 NW2d 67 (2001). Whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>a defendant\u2019s right to present a defense was violated by the exclusion of evidence is a constitutional question that this Court reviews de novo. <em>People v Kurr, </em>253 Mich App 317, 327; 654 NW2d 651 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">We conclude that defendant was not deprived of his constitutional right to present a defense. He had ample opportunity through other testimony and evidence to challenge Remer\u2019s credibility and alleged bias against defendant. Defendant was able to show that Remer and Starnes shared a longstanding friendship, that they corresponded during Starnes\u2019s incarceration, and that Remer had a motive to protect Starnes. The single statement in the letter upon which defendant focuses was little more than a cumulative detail. Furthermore, its probative value was minimal in context: the next three sentences in the letter were, \u201cI don\u2019t care if you have to go against me. Like I said, do whatever it takes. It\u2019s your life on the line.\u201d The trial court\u2019s exclusion of the contents of the letter did not in any way impair defendant\u2019s right to present a defense, and thus, even if we presume that the exclusion was erroneous, it was harmless. See <em>People v Shepherd, </em>472 Mich 343, 347; 697 NW2d 144 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">Defendant next argues that the prosecutor improperly introduced hearsay and double hearsay statements. Because this claim of error was not raised below, we review it for plain error affecting substantial rights. <em>People v Callon, </em>256 Mich App 312, 329; 662 NW2d 501 (2003). Hearsay is inadmissible unless a recognized exception applies. MRE 802. Where multiple levels of hearsay are involved, all declarations made must not be hearsay or must fall within a recognized exception. MRE 805. After reviewing the portion of the record of which defendant complains, we find highly improper and misleading questioning by the prosecutor during the cross-examination of defendant, but no actual hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>The first improper questioning was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-3\"><em>Q. </em>But Mr. Remer simply got it wrong when he said to this jury in this courtroom and at a preliminary exam at another hearing under oath that you said we killed him? He\u2019s mistaken about that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-4\"><em>A. </em>I would say so, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-5\"><em>Q. </em>He also talked about, Mr. Remer talked about, his private conversation with Mr. Starnes at the preliminary exam didn\u2019t he? Where he had a one-on-one conversation with Mr. Starnes that you were there for, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-6\"><em>A. </em>I don\u2019t recall that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-7\"><em>Q. </em>Do you remember the testimony [at the preliminary examination]? If he testified to it or are we making it up? The fact of what he said in court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-8\"><em>A. </em>I don\u2019t remember that exactly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-9\"><em>Q. </em>You don\u2019t remember the point where Kyle Remer testified in District Court saying I spoke with Bradley Starnes. He told me that they killed him. You don\u2019t remember when he testified to that at the preliminary exam and your attorney was objecting saying you can\u2019t use this against Mr. Mesik and there was a slight back and forth and the judge said no we\u2019ll only use this against Mr. Starnes. Do you remember that part?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-10\"><em>A. </em>I\u2019m not sure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-11\"><em>Q. </em>Mr. Remer is testifying against Mr. Starnes. And he testified against Mr. Starnes. Hasn\u2019t he?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-12\"><em>A. </em>I\u2019m, yes, I guess so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-13\"><em>Q. </em>He\u2019s testified that Mr. Starnes has actually taken credit for this killing saying we killed him. Put himself in jeopardy. This is what Mr. Remer has testified to, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-14\"><em>A. </em>I\u2019ll say again I don\u2019t exactly recall.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-15\"><em>Q. </em>It\u2019s in the transcript. Will you take my word for it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-16\"><em>A. </em>If it\u2019s in\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number><em>Q. </em>Do you want to see it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-5\"><em>A. </em>I guess I could see it, yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A0l\">The transcript was never actually provided. In fact, during oral argument before this Court, the prosecutor conceded that Remer did not actually make several of the statements that the prosecutor had attributed to him, including \u201cI spoke with Bradley Starnes. He told me that they killed him.\u201d The prosecutor\u2019s questioning was therefore misleading and, in our view, improper.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">However, there is no hearsay in any of the above questioning. Regarding the first question, Remer had already testified at defendant\u2019s trial, where he stated that defendant and Starnes told Remer \u201cthat they killed Red.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Remer had also already testified at trial that he had said at the preliminary examination that defendant told him that they killed McDonald. The prosecutor\u2019s first question was therefore no more than a summary of a prior witness\u2019s testimony at trial. Furthermore, the purpose of the question was apparently to challenge defendant\u2019s position that Remer was biased in favor of Starnes and against defendant, rather than to prove that, in fact, defendant had killed McDonald. Because the challenged statement was not offered for the truth of its contents, it is not hearsay. MRE 801(c). Statements against penal interest are also not hearsay. MRE 801(d); MRE 804(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">The remaining challenged questions are also not hearsay because they are not even evidence. Had defendant confirmed, as a witness from the stand, any of the assertions by the prosecutor, those confirmations would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>have constituted evidence. But defendant only denied any recollection of the matters about which he was asked. Although the prosecutor\u2019s questions were, as noted, misleading and improper, the prosecutor\u2019s questions are not evidence and therefore cannot be hearsay. The trial court properly instructed the jury that \u201cevidence includes only the sworn testimony of witnesses and the exhibits admitted into evidence\u201d and, among other things, \u201cthe lawyers\u2019 questions to witnesses are not evidence\u201d and should be considered \u201conly as they give meaning to the witnesses\u2019 answers.\u201d Because there is no evidence from which we can conclude that the jury was unable to follow its instructions, the trial court\u2019s instructions cured any prejudice. See <em>Callon, supra </em>at 330-331.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">In sum, although the questioning was improper, it did not constitute hearsay, and defendant has not shown plain error affecting substantial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">Defendant next argues that he is entitled to reversal because of prosecutorial misconduct. We disagree. We also review this unpreserved claim for plain error affecting substantial rights. <em>People v Thomas, </em>260 Mich App 450, 454; 678 NW2d 631 (2004). The test of prosecutorial misconduct is whether the defendant was denied a fair and impartial trial. <em>People v Dobek, </em>274 Mich App 58, 63; 732 NW2d 546 (2007). Defendant first argues that the prosecutor\u2019s introduction of hearsay and double hearsay statements, discussed above, constituted prosecutorial misconduct. As noted, however, the questioning was not hearsay, and the jury was properly instructed to disregard the attorneys\u2019 questions as constituting evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">Defendant also argues that the prosecutor engaged in misconduct because he misrepresented Remer\u2019s preliminary examination testimony. Specifically, he chai<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>lenges the prosecutor\u2019s representation to defendant on cross-examination that Remer had testified regarding a private conversation with Starnes in which Starnes admitted that he and defendant killed McDonald. Defendant is correct that the prosecutor did ask him about this alleged testimony, and he is also correct that Remer did not testify at the preliminary examination regarding such a conversation. However, defendant consistently responded that he did not recall that Remer had so testified. Under these circumstances, defendant cannot establish the requisite level of prejudice under the plain error rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">Defendant also argues that the misrepresentation of Starnes\u2019s testimony was reiterated during the prosecutor\u2019s closing arguments. However, the passage of the closing arguments cited by defendant includes references to what Remer stated that defendant admitted, not Starnes.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">Finally, defendant argues that the prosecutor\u2019s statements during closing arguments related to the presumption of innocence denied him a fair trial. Regardless of how the prosecutor described the burden of proof, the trial court properly instructed the jury regarding the presumption of innocence and clearly stated that the jury must take the law as given by the court. \u201cJurors are presumed to follow their instructions, and instructions are presumed to cure most errors.\u201d <em>People v Abraham, </em>256 Mich App 265, 279; 662 NW2d 836 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">Defendant next argues that he is entitled to a new trial because he was denied effective assistance of counsel. We disagree. Our review of this unpreserved claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is limited to mistakes apparent on the record. <em>People v Matuszak, </em>263 Mich App 42, 48; 687 NW2d 342 (2004). In order to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, defendant must show: (1) counsel\u2019s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness under prevailing professional norms; (2) there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s error, the result of the proceedings would have been different; and (3) the resultant proceedings were fundamentally unfair or unreliable. <em>People v Rodgers, </em>248 Mich App 702, 714; 645 NW2d 294 (2001). Defendant must also overcome a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s actions were the product of sound trial strategy. <em>People v Carbin, </em>463 Mich 590, 600; 623 NW2d 884 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">Defendant first argues that counsel was ineffective for failing to raise a hearsay objection to the prosecutor\u2019s reference to Remer\u2019s preliminary examination testimony during cross-examination of defendant. As discussed above, the cited testimony was properly admitted. Defense counsel has no obligation to raise a meritless motion or make a meritless objection. <em>People v Kulpinski, </em>243 Mich App 8, 27; 620 NW2d 537 (2000). Defendant also argues that counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the prosecutor\u2019s mischaracterization of Remer\u2019s preliminary examination testimony during closing arguments. As noted earlier, while the questioning did mischaracterize the prior testimony, defendant\u2019s denials remained unchallenged by extrinsic evidence. Therefore, this argument fails because defendant has not established that there is a reasonable probability that the result of the proceedings would have been different had his counsel objected. <em>Rodgers, supra </em>at 714. Finally, defendant argues that he was denied effective assistance of counsel for failure to object to the prosecutor\u2019s description of the presumption of innocence. Again, any error was effectively cured by the court\u2019s jury charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>Next, we reject defendant\u2019s argument that the trial court erred by allowing the introduction of photographs of the victim\u2019s body at the crime scene. A trial court\u2019s decision to admit photographs into evidence is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>Aldrich, supra </em>at 113. Evidence is unfairly prejudicial if it presents a danger that the jury would give undue or preemptive weight to marginally probative evidence. <em>People v Ortiz, </em>249 Mich App 297, 306; 642 NW2d 417 (2002). While gruesome photographs should not be admitted solely to garner sympathy from the jury, a photograph that is admissible for some other purpose is not rendered inadmissible because of its gruesome details. <em>People v Ho, </em>231 Mich App 178, 188; 585 NW2d 357 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">Defendant argues that the photographs were not necessary because the manner of death was not disputed at trial and instead the main dispute involved the number and identity of the murderers. However, the prosecution is required to prove each element of a charged offense regardless of whether the defendant specifically disputes or offers to stipulate any of the elements. <em>People v Crawford, </em>458 Mich 376, 389; 582 NW2d 785 (1998). Therefore, while defendant did not contest McDonald\u2019s cause of death, the prosecution was not relieved of its duty to prove all the elements of first-degree murder, including intent. The photographs were helpful to meet this burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">Finally, defendant argues <em>in propria persona </em>that MCL 750.316, Michigan\u2019s first-degree murder statute, is unconstitutional because the term \u201cmurder\u201d is not defined by statute. He argues that the statute fails to advise defendants of the nature of the charge against them, is impermissibly vague, and is therefore void as being facially unconstitutional. While it is true that the word \u201cmurder\u201d is not defined by statute, and in Michi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>gan never <em>has </em>been defined by statute, see <em>People v Aaron, </em>409 Mich 672; 299 NW2d 304 (1980), no such definition is required. We find nothing vague about what conduct is prohibited by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">The constitution requires criminal statutes to give \u201cfair warning\u201d to defendants of what conduct will constitute a crime without resorting to speculation, and they must provide adequate guidance to the trier of fact without requiring a court to \u201cinterpret\u201d any ambiguities. <em>People v Dempster, </em>396 Mich 700, 714-715; 242 NW2d 381 (1976). Thus, a person of reasonable intelligence may not be required to guess at or meaningfully differ in opinion regarding what conduct is proscribed, but a \u201cstatute is sufficiently definite if its meaning can fairly be ascertained by reference to judicial interpretations, the common law, dictionaries, treatises, or the commonly accepted meanings of words.\u201d <em>People v Noble, </em>238 Mich App 647, 651-652; 608 NW2d 123 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">According to the <em>Random House Webster\u2019s College Dictionary </em>(2001), \u201cmurder\u201d is \u201cthe unlawful killing of a person, esp. when done with deliberation or premeditation or occurring during the commission of another serious crime.\u201d According to caselaw more than 150 years old, \u201c[m]urder is where a person of sound memory and discretion unlawfully kills any reasonable creature in being, in the peace of the state, with malice prepense or aforethought, either express or implied. This, the common law definition, is still retained in our statute.\u201d <em>People v Potter, </em>5 Mich 1, 6 (1858). On September 6, 1788, before Michigan was even a separate territory, an act of the territorial government of the Northwest Territory did provide that \u201c [i]f any person or persons shall with malice aforethought, kill or slay another person, he, she, or they so offending, shall be deemed guilty of murder ....\u201d Samuel Johnson\u2019s contemporary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number><em>A Dictionary of the English Language, </em>Vol II (6th ed, 1785), defined \u201cmurder,\u201d in relevant part, as \u201c[t]he act of killing a man unlawfully; the act of killing criminally.\u201d In short, the term has been settled in the law and in common parlance for centuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">Of course, not all killing constitutes murder: \u201cmalice aforethought is the \u2018grand criterion\u2019 which elevates a homicide, which may be innocent or criminal, to murder.\u201d <em>Aaron, supra </em>at 714 (footnote and citation omitted). But the fact that there are circumstances under which a killing will not be murder, such as accidents or in self-defense, is also well established. See, e.g., <em>Errington and Others\u2019 Case, </em>2 Lewin, Crown Cas 217, 219-220; 168 Eng Rep 1133, 1134 (Newcastle Assizes, 1838),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> often studied in law school. This is well known in everyday life, as well. Exactly what constitutes \u201cmalice aforethought\u201d is a term of art, but again, it is defined both in caselaw and in the dictionary.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>We recognize that there are circumstances under which a statute may be rendered unconstitutional because of the absence of a definition. Without purporting to render any sort of advisory opinion, we note by way of example that a statute proscribing \u201cannoyance\u201d may well be impermissibly vague without further guidance, simply because of the known variability in what reasonable individuals personally consider \u201cannoying.\u201d But no hint of any such ambiguity exists here. Indeed, we find incredible the contention that any reasonable person would have to guess at the meaning of the word \u201cmurder\u201d or what conduct is likely to expose him or her to criminal liability therefor.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b549-7\"> Our original unpublished opinion per curiam in this case neglected to consider the arguments raised in defendant\u2019s supplemental brief on appeal that he filed <em>in propria persona. </em>This opinion corrects that omission.
