Said Daniel Stevens had his settlement in Gilmanton, in' 1799, having gained it under a law of this State passed prior to the 31st day of December, A. D. 1795, and resided in that part of Gilmanton which is now Gilford. Before the year 1812 he removed into that part which is still Gilmanton; from which place he removed into Bamstead, where he remained at the time the town of Gilmanton was divided, June, 1812.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b456-7\">It was agreed that if, upon the foregoing ease, the court shall be of opinion that said Daniel Stevens gained a settlement in Gilmanton, under any law of this State passed since the 81st day of December, A. \u25a0 D. 1795, then judgment shall be rendered for the plaintiffs for the sum sued for in their writ, and costs; otherwise, judgment shall be rendered for the defendants for costs.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b457-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number><em>Mazelton, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b457-5\"><em>Fogg, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b457-6\">Gilchrist, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AEDP\">This is an action brought to charge the town of Gilmanton, as being the place of the legal settlement of Lydia Stevens. Her settlement, if such she had, was derived from her father, and not otherwise. His settlement depended upon laws passed prior to 1796, and, therefore, cannot be proved since the statute of July 8, 1841.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">The act severing the town of Gilmanton does not make the case an exception, under the act of 1841; nor does the severing of a town give any one a settlement who had not one before.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">\n<em>Judgment for the defendant.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
