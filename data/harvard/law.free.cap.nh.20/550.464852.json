Burns, both of Dover, and co-partners in business, on, &amp;c., at, &amp;e., \u201c not being then and there a licensed taverner or retailer, did then and there unlawfully sell one pint of spirituous liquors,\u201d to one B. P. H., contrary to the form of the statute, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b550-14\">The defendants demurred, and assigned for cause that the indictment fails to allege that the defendants were not, at the time of the alleged offence, licensed taverners or retailers, &amp;c.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b550-15\"><em>Clark, </em>solicitor, for the State.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b550-16\">Woodman, for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b550-17\">Gilchrist, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AqCq\">The indictment charges that John Burns and Patrick H.

But we think the indictment is well. It is the same as if it alleged that John Burns, not being a licensed taverner, &amp;c., and Patrick H. Burns, not being a licensed taverner, &amp;c., did sell, &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">The indictment should in some apt form impute to the defendants severally the disqualification, and it may well be understood so'to do in its present form, <em>reddendo singula singulis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">\n<em>Demurrer overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
