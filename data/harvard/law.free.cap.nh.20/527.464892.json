There was also a general count for money had and received, money paid, goods sold, and labor done.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b527-7\">The account annexed to the writ, which was also the specification under the general count, was as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b527-8\">\u201cJohn Mudgett to Daniel <em>G. </em>Smith, <em>Dr.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A_m\">1843, Sept. To ironing one gig wagon, $25.00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AEM\">interest on same, 1.50</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b527-9\">$26.50.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b527-10\">The plaintiff proved that in July, 1843, he sold a horse to one John Wesley Mudgett, a son of the defendant, and that in part payment the purchaser agreed to iron a wagon for the plaintiff. He soon afterwards sent the wagon to be ironed, to the shop occupied by the defendant and John Wesley Mudgett, but before it was all delivered there the latter had removed from the town. The defendant, however, said that he had agreed to iron the wagon for his son, and would do so, but never did.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b528-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>The horse which the son received of the plaintiff' was exchanged by him for another, which came into the possession of the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b528-5\">A verdict was taken by consent for the plaintiff, subject to the opinion of the court upon the question whether the action can be maintained upon the evidence.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b528-6\"><em>Lovell, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b528-7\"><em>Stevens, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b528-8\">Gilchrist, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Apj\">This is an action of general <em>indebitatus assumpsit, </em>for \u201c ironing a gig wagon and the evidence shows that John Wesley Mudgett bought ahorse of the plaintiff, and promised to pay him for it by ironing the gig wagon; that the plaintiff delivered at the shop occupied by John Wesley and the defendant the wagon that the former had agreed to iron, and that the defendant promised to iron it in payment of John Wesley\u2019s debt or undertaking.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-10\">It is impossible to maintain this action upon such evidence. There was, as between these two parties, no consideration whatever for the promise that the defendant seems to have made. The plaintiff was not induced to part with the property which he sold to John Wesley, by any undertaking of the defendant to pay for it, by ironing the wagon or otherwise; and there is no proof whatever of any consideration, moving from John Wesley, which could have sustained the defendant\u2019s promise, so as to have made it the source of an action in favor of this plaintiff. The promise of the defendant was merely voluntary, and no action lies to enforce it.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-11\">The form of the declaration, moreover, does not correspond with the case. It seems to be for the plaintiff\u2019s work in ironing a wagon, instead of an action for damages for the defendant\u2019s non-performance of an undertaking to do such a work.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-12\">The verdict must be set aside, and a</p>\n<p id=\"b528-13\">\n<em>New trial granted.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
