At that time, Code \u00a7 18.2-102 classified that offense as a class 6 felony. A class 6 felony is punishable by \u201ca term of imprisonment of not less than one year nor more than five years, or . . . confinement in jail for not more than twelve months and a fine of not more than one thousand dollars, either or both.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-10(f). The order entered August 22, 1977, upon that conviction provided that \u201cthe court . . . doth now . . . suspend the imposition of sentence . . . during [defendant\u2019s] good behavior conditioned that he serve six months in jail.\u201d The order further pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>vided that \u201cupon his release from incarceration, the defendant is placed on supervised probation\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\">In a \u201cshow cause\u201d hearing conducted March 12, 1979, the trial court found that defendant had violated certain conditions of probation and ordered that \u201cthe sentence heretofore suspended is hereby revoked to the extent that you are sentenced to ten months in the City Jail\u201d. The trial court advised defendant that \u201cthe imposition of a penitentiary sentence is still suspended\u201d and warned him that \u201c[t]his will be your last chance not to go to the penitentiary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">Upon his release after serving this sentence, defendant violated the conditions of probation again. The trial court entered an order September 5, 1980, providing that \u201cthree years and eight months, the balance of the five years of the suspended imposition of sentence, are this day revoked.\u201d<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">On appeal from that order, defendant invokes the constitutional guarantees against double jeopardy. U.S. CONST, amend. V; Va. CONST, art. I, \u00a7 8. We need not consider the double jeopardy question.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-7\">Defendant does not challenge the trial court\u2019s authority to fix the initial six-month jail term as a condition of probation, and he conceded on brief that the ten-month sentence \u201cwas within the Court\u2019s authority under \u00a7 19.2-306 of the Virginia Code\u201d. For purposes of this opinion, we accept these concessions. Code \u00a7 19.2-306 defines the sentencing authority of a trial court which has found a probationary violation. In the event a sentence has been imposed upon a conviction and execution of sentence has been suspended for a probationary period, a trial court may revoke the suspension; in such case, \u201cthe original sentence shall be in full force and effect\u201d. But \u201cin case the imposition of sentence has been suspended, the Court may pronounce whatever sentence might have been originally imposed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b738-8\">This is a case of suspension of imposition of sentence. The trial court might originally have imposed up to five years in the penitentiary <em>or </em>up to twelve months in jail and a fine. Code \u00a7 18.2-10(f). The disjunctive language of the statute prescribes penalties in the alternative. When the trial court revoked suspension of imposition of sentence for the first probationary violation and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>imposed a ten-month jail term, the sentencing authority vested in it by Code \u00a7 19.2-306 was exhausted. Because the trial court was without jurisdiction to impose the penitentiary sentence, the order appealed from is null and void. Accordingly, that order will be vacated and defendant, having served the sentence imposed, will be released from custody and probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-4\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b738-9\"> Manifestly, the trial court mistakenly believed that it had pronounced a sentence of five years\u2019 imprisonment at the time of conviction.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
