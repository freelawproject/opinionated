Rogers, sought reimbursement for the costs of chiropractic treatment under the medical payments coverage clause of a motor vehicle insurance policy issued by the appellee, Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company. The trial court ruled that \u201cmedical services are limited to those performed by or related to one engaged in the practice of medicine,\u201d denied Rogers\u2019s claim, and entered judgment for Nationwide.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-10\">The medical payments clause provides, in part, that Nationwide will \u201cpay all reasonable expenses incurred ... for necessary medical, surgical, X-ray and dental services, including prosthetic devices, and necessary ambulance, hospital, professional nursing and funeral services.\u201d This follows the mandate of Code \u00a7\u00a7 38.1-21(2) and 38.1-380.1(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-11\">Rogers offered no evidence to show what constitutes \u201cmedical . . . services,\u201d but he contends on appeal that the term is broad enough to include chiropractic services, and he urges us to construe the statutes and the medical payments clause of the policy accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-12\">Code \u00a7 38.1-380.1(a) requires that the optional medical payments clause of a motor vehicle insurance policy provide, as minimum coverage, \u201c[a] 11 reasonable and necessary expenses for medical, hospital, dental, surgical, ambulance, prosthetic and rehabilitation services, and funeral expenses . . . .\u201d Neither the policy nor Code \u00a7 38.1-380.1(a) defines the term \u201cmedical . . . services.\u201d However, Title 54, Chapter 12, entitled \u201cMedicine and Other Healing Arts,\u201d illustrates the legislative intent to distinguish among different types of healing arts. Code \u00a7 54-273 defines <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>the terms used in Chapter 12. The section defines the term \u201chealing arts\u201d broadly, \u00a7 54-273(2), and then, the \u201cPractice of medicine or osteopathy,\u201d \u00a7 54-273(3), and the \u201cPractice of chiropractic,\u201d \u00a7 54-273(6), as subspecies of that rubric.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">Having made this distinction, the General Assembly, in deciding to require coverage of costs of services performed by licensed chiropractors under accident and sickness insurance policies, found it necessary to enact Code \u00a7 38.1-347.1. Had the legislature intended to impose a similar coverage requirement upon motor vehicle liability insurance policies, it could have done so by selective enactment. It did not do so, and we cannot assume that its failure was a legislative inadvertence. As we construe the statute, Code \u00a7 38.1- 380.1(a) does not require the coverage of chiropractic treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">Because that section sets only minimum coverage standards, an insurer is free to include coverage for chiropractic care in a medical payments clause of a motor vehicle insurance policy if it chooses to do so. Upon comparison, we find that the terms of Rogers\u2019s policy are substantially similar to those required by Code \u00a7 38.1- 380.1(a), and, since the statute does not mandate coverage of chiropractic treatment, we hold that Rogers\u2019s policy does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">Finding no error below, we will affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
