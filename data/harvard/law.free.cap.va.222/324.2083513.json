Under the agreement, an employee was required to present a grievance to his shop steward, a union official, \u201cin writing within five (5) days from the date [the grievance] was found to exist by the employee or the Union.\u201d The shop steward was then required to present the grievance to the Company\u2019s supervisory representative \u201cwithin three (3) working days or the matter [would be] considered settled.\u201d In the event the grievance was not settled, the parties could submit the dispute to arbitration \u201cif it involve [d] the application or interpretation of the terms of [the] Agreement.\u201d While the arbitrator could not \u201cadd to, subtract from, terminate or modify any of the terms of the Agreement,\u201d his decision as to the application or interpretation of the agreement\u2019s terms would be \u201cfinal and binding upon the Employer, the Union and all Employees concerned.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b362-10\">On April 26, 1978, a severe storm damaged the Company\u2019s plant. Claiming that the storm threatened their safety, an unspecified number of employees walked off their jobs. On Thursday, April 27, 1978, the Company disciplined several employees and notified them of its actions. On Friday, April 28, one employee not previously notified received notice. On Thursday, May 4, three grievances were filed with a shop steward. On Friday, May 5, five additional grievances were filed with a steward, and the eight grievances were presented that day to the Company\u2019s representative. On Monday, May 8, nine additional grievances were filed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>with a steward, who presented them to the Company\u2019s representative the same day.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\">Ultimately, the grievances were submitted to an arbitrator. Apparently concluding that a grievance would be timely filed if presented to the Company within eight days, regardless of when it had been filed with the shop steward, the arbitrator rejected the Company\u2019s claim of employee tardiness in filing the grievances. Then, turning to the merits, the arbitrator vacated all disciplinary action taken against the employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">Following the arbitrator\u2019s decision, the Company brought this suit in equity seeking to set aside the award on the grounds that the arbitrator had erroneously calculated the time periods for filing grievances and had ignored the requirement that grievances be submitted to a shop steward within five days. Counsel for the Union agreed in the trial court that \u201cthe arithmetic computations of the arbitrator regarding the period of time within which the grievances were required . . . to be presented in writing to a shop steward, were incorrect, and that the grievances had not been presented to a shop steward in writing within five days from the date they were found to exist,\u201d as provided in the agreement. Holding that the arbitrator had made an error apparent on the face of the award, the trial court vacated the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">On appeal, the Union first contends that a purely procedural question was involved in the Company\u2019s claim of employee tardiness in filing the grievances. Then, citing <em>John Wiley &amp; Sons </em>v. <em>Livingston, </em>376 U.S. 543 (1964), the Union argues that procedural questions growing out of a particular dispute should be left exclusively with the arbitrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">We disagree with the Union\u2019s argument. Under Virginia law, a court may modify or set aside an arbitrator\u2019s award for errors in procedural, as well as substantive, matters. <em>See Moore </em>v. Luckess\u2019 <em>Next of Kin, </em>64 Va. (23 Gratt.) 160 (1873) (statute of limitations). The Virginia view does not conflict with the <em>Livingston </em>holding; <em>Livingston </em>merely stands for the proposition that, if a court determines the parties have agreed to submit their differences to arbitration,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the arbitrator should have an opportunity to resolve <em>in the first instance </em>\u201cintertwined issues of \u2018substance\u2019 and \u2018procedure\u2019 growing out of a single dispute and raising the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>questions on the same facts.\u201d 376 U.S. at 557. Where, as here, a post-award review is involved and the procedural and substantive issues are not intertwined but are separate and distinct, the <em>Livingston </em>rule has no application.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">Next, citing <em>Sydnor Co. </em>v. <em>County School Board, </em>182 Va. 156, 28 S.E.2d 33 (1943), and Code \u00a7 8.01-580,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the Union contends that an arbitrator\u2019s award should not be set aside unless palpable error is apparent on its face. The Union argues that the alleged \u201cerror apparent,\u201d <em>viz., </em>the arbitrator\u2019s holding that the grievances were timely even though not filed within the initial five-day period,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> was not a palpable error, but a \u201ctrifling matter.\u201d In this connection, the Union maintains that the five-day filing requirement is for its sole benefit and that the Company \u201chas no actual interest\u201d in the requirement. Accordingly, the Union concludes, the intent of the collective bargaining agreement is satisfied \u201cas long as the grievance is filed with the Company within the total period of time allotted for such filing, i.e., the five days plus three working days.\u201d In any event, the Union asserts, the collective bargaining agreement empowered the arbitrator to make \u201cfinal and binding\u201d interpretations of the agreement, and the arbitrator merely interpreted the five-day filing requirement \u201cas not conferring any substantive rights\u201d upon the Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">We respond to these arguments in inverse order. First, we can find nothing in the arbitrator\u2019s written opinion that can be classified as an interpretation of the five-day filing requirement; indeed, the opinion shows clearly that the arbitrator simply ignored the requirement. Second, nothing in the collective bargaining agreement, the other parts of the record, or the cited authority supports the Union\u2019s argument that the five-day filing requirement was included in the collective bargaining agreement for the Union\u2019s sole benefit. The requirement is an obvious limitation upon the right of an employee to assert a grievance, and the Company surely has an interest in compliance with the requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>Finally, we believe the arbitrator\u2019s error in disregarding the five-day filing requirement is both apparent on the face of the award and palpable.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> A \u201cpalpable\u201d error is one that is obvious and easily perceptible. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1000 (5th ed. 1979). In <em>Hollingsworth </em>v. <em>Lupton &amp; Wife, </em>18 Va. (4 Mun.) 114, 117 (1813), we characterized palpable errors as those of such \u201ca nature, as to induce a belief that they must have proceeded from some improper bias in the minds of the arbitrators, or from some gross misbehaviour or inattention.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\">We have said also that the \u201crule as to palpable mistakes does not comprehend errors of judgment in its fair exercise upon the matter.\u201d <em>Bassett\u2019s Adm\u2019r </em>v. <em>Cunningham\u2019s Adm\u2019r, </em>50 Va. (9 Gratt.) 684, 688 (1853). The arbitrator\u2019s disregard of the five-day filing requirement in this case, however, was not a mere error of judgment. In our opinion, this record shows clearly that the arbitrator\u2019s error resulted from \u201cgross . . . inattention\u201d to the collective bargaining agreement\u2019s unambiguous provisions. <em>Hollingsworth, </em>18 Va. (4 Mun.) at 117.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">For the reasons assigned, the judgment of the trial court will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b363-8\"> Whether the parties are obligated to submit an issue to arbitration is a matter of law for the court to determine. <em>Doyle &amp; Russell </em>v. <em>Roanoke Hospital, </em>213 Va. 489, 494, 193 S.E.2d 662, 666 (1973).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b364-6\"> Code \u00a7 8.01-580 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-7\">No such [arbitration] award shall be set aside, except for errors apparent on its face, unless it appear to have been procured by corruption or other undue means, or that there was partiality or misbehavior in the arbitrators or umpires, or any of them. But this section shall not be construed to take away the power of courts of equity over awards.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b364-8\"> Of the seventeen grievances involved in the case, none was filed with a steward within the five-day period set forth in the collective bargaining agreement. Eight were filed with the Company within the eight-day period. The other nine missed even the eight-day deadline.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b365-7\"> Of course, in addition to being palpable, the error must relate to a material matter. <em>Sydnor Co. </em>v. <em>County School Board. </em>182 Va. 156, 168, 28 S.E.2d 33, 37 (1943). The Union misconstrues this language to mean that an error on a procedural matter should not be corrected. The requirement of materiality instead merely means that a court should set aside an award for palpable error only if it concludes the arbitrator, if he recognized the error, would have issued a different award. The error in the present case satisfies this requirement.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
