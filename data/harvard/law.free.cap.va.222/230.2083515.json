For the reasons hereinafter set forth, we hold that the Fairfax County ordinance was in conflict with the statewide regulation and must therefore yield to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-12\">On June 10, 1976, Miller and Smith, Inc. (Miller and Smith), a housing construction firm located in Fairfax County, sought from the Board of Supervisors of Fairfax County (Fairfax County) a refund of the fees it had paid for eleven of 1,168 building permits acquired by it in 1973 and 1974 but never utilized. Fairfax County denied its request. Miller and Smith again asked in writing for a refund on July 8, 1977, this time for the fees paid on all 1,168 permits, totaling $42,516. After Fairfax County failed to take action, Miller and Smith, on September 9, 1977, filed for a declaratory judgment, asking the trial court to require Fairfax <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>County to refund the full amount. The trial court, sitting without a jury, heard the case on July 5, 1978.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\">In 1972, the General Assembly adopted Chapter 829 (Code \u00a7\u00a7 36-97 through 36-119) directing and empowering the State Board of Housing to adopt and promulgate a Uniform Statewide Building Code (U.S.B.C.) which would supersede all local building codes and regulations. The adopted code, patterned after the Building Officials and Code Administration model codes (BOCA), will be referred to in the opinion as BOCA/U.S.B.C. The refund provision of BOCA/U.S.B.C. was worded in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-5\">In the case of a revocation or abandonment or discontinuance of a building project, the volume of the work actually completed shall be computed and any excess fee for the in-completed work shall be returned to the permit holder.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">BOCA/U.S.B.C. \u00a7 118.8.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">Prior to September 1, 1973, Fairfax County had its own building code, basically a codification of BOCA with some modifications. In adopting BOCA, Fairfax County modified the BOCA provisi\u00f3n concerning refund of building permit fees to read in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-8\">Any permit. . . under which no work is commenced, may be cancelled upon the application of the owner at any time within six (6) months from the date of issuance and the Board of Supervisors shall refund fifty percent of the fee paid for such permit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b269-9\">Fairfax County Code \u00a7 6-5 (g)( 1961) as amended August 4, 1971.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-10\">BOCA/U.S.B.C. became effective September 1, 1973. Fairfax County amended its building code subsequent to this date, but did not change its original refund provision, continuing this provision as Fairfax County Code \u00a7 6-6(1), the alleged supersession of which is at issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-11\">The trial court concluded that because BOCA/U.S.B.C. \u00a7 118.8 had been adopted by the State Board of Housing, the action of Fairfax County in adopting, in Fairfax County Code \u00a7 6-6(1), a different provision dealing with building permit refunds was invalid. The court thus computed the refund based on the amount of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>incompleted work without regard to the provisions of the local code.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">I. <em>Jurisdiction of Circuit Court.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">Fairfax County contends that the circuit court lacked jurisdiction of the claim because Miller and Smith did not follow the appeal procedures set forth in Code \u00a7\u00a7 15.1-552, -553, and hence the bar of Code \u00a7 15.1-554 controls. <em>See Chesterfield County </em>v. <em>Town &amp; Country Apartments, </em>214 Va. 587, 203 S.E.2d 117 (1974). But the record clearly indicates that counsel for Miller and Smith, by letter dated July 8, 1977, and addressed to the Fairfax County Board and all of its officials charged with the enforcement of the building code, specifically requested the refunds with the listing of the projects involved. Approximately seven months later, the clerk of the Board of Supervisors of Fairfax County notified counsel for Miller and Smith that there was no evidence the refund claim was ever presented to the Board of Supervisors. We agree with the trial court that, within the meaning of Code \u00a7 15.1-553, Fairfax County had \u201crefused or neglected to act upon the claim,\u201d and it is excepted from the bar of Code \u00a7\u00a7 15.1-553 and -554. <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Prince William County, </em>198 Va. 231, 93 S.E.2d 136 (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">Fairfax County argues further that it was a prerequisite to circuit court jurisdiction that administrative remedies under the building code and its regulations should first be exhausted. Code \u00a7\u00a7 36-105, -114, -116, and -118, and \u00a7 127.1 of the Regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">Code \u00a7 36-105 provides that \u201cno appeal to the State Building Code Technical Review Board shall lie prior to a final determination by the local Board of Building Code appeals.\u201d Code \u00a7 36-105 also provides that the local board\u2019s \u201cduties and responsibilities shall be prescribed in the Building Code.\u201d The Building Code is defined in Code \u00a7 36-97(5) as the U.S.B.C.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-8\">The only provision in BOCA/U.S.B.C. providing for appeals to the local board is \u00a7 127.1. The first sentence of \u00a7 127.1 defines the scope of a local board review authority. It is any \u201cdecision of the building official refusing to grant a modification to the provisions of this code covering the <em>manner of construction or materials to be </em>used\u201d in the erection, alteration, or repair of a building or structure. (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b270-9\">The second sentence of \u00a7 127.1 provides the situations in which an appeal will lie from a decision concerning \u201cthe manner of con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>struction or the materials to be used.\u201d These situations are (1) where the true intent of this Code or of the rules legally adopted thereunder has been incorrectly interpreted; (2) where the provisions of this Code do not fully apply; or (3) where an equally good or better form of construction can be used. This sentence does not provide additional areas of appeal, but rather sets out the situations wherein the local board of appeals may overturn the building official\u2019s decision as to the \u201cmanner of construction or materials to be used\u201d if the local board of appeals finds one of more of the three situations to exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">Section 127.1 therefore limits the jurisdiction of local boards of appeal to appeals from decisions of the building official as to the \u201cmanner of construction or materials to be used.\u201d The validity of a local ordinance such as Fairfax County Code \u00a7 6-6(1) is not a question within the scope of \u00a7 127.1, nor should it be. The local building official would not be qualified to make such a determination. Refunds are not covered by the \u00a7 127.1 administrative appeal procedure. Since this is the only statutory delegation of appellate jurisdiction to local boards of appeal, Miller and Smith\u2019s refund request was not a proper subject of this appeal process and, consequently, not a matter within the purview of the State Technical Review Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">II. <em>Is Fairfax County Code \u00a7 6-6(1) Superseded by State Regulation BOCA/U.S.B.C. \u00a7 118.8?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">The enabling legislation, Code \u00a7 36-98, the regulation promulgated thereunder, and the Fairfax County ordinance are set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b272-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>In <em>Board of Supervisors of Loudoun County, et al. </em>v. <em>Pumphrey, </em>221 Va. 205, 206-07, 269 S.E.2d 361, 362 (1980), we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-4\">Code \u00a7 1-13.17 . . . precludes a local governing body from enacting ordinances \u201cinconsistent with\u201d state law .... [A]n ordinance may not conflict with state law. <em>Hanbury </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>203 Va. 182, 185, 122 S.E.2d 911, 913 (1961); <em>Allen </em>v. <em>City of Norfolk, </em>196 Va. 177, 180, 83 S.E.2d 397, 399 (1954).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-5\">Code \u00a7 1-13.17 provides: \u201cWhen the council or authorities of any city or town, or any corporation, board, or number of persons, are authorized to make ordinances, bylaws, rules, regulations or orders, it shall be understood that the same must not be inconsistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States or of this State.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">On the same day, in <em>Tabler, etc. </em>v. <em>Supervisors, Fairfax County, </em>221 Va. 200, 202, 269 S.E.2d 358, 359 (1980), we said: \u201cAs noted in several recent decisions, Virginia follows the Dillon Rule of strict construction concerning the legislative powers of local governing bodies . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">Fairfax County argues that the power given under Code \u00a7 36-98 to adopt and promulgate a BOCA/U.S.B.C. does not include the authority to adopt administrative procedures for the code so adopted. In fact, they argue that Code \u00a7 36-99 explicating the code was limited to standards in the construction of buildings and structures, and that the provision for \u201cprocedures for the administration and enforcement of such standards\u201d was not added until Acts 1977, c. 427, which was adopted subsequent to the events of this case. The argument then is that at the time BOCA/U.S.B.C. was promulgated, January 29, 1973, to be effective not later than September 1, 1973, the power to prescribe administrative standards and procedures did not then exist, and only came into existence by the express language of the 1977 amendment to Code \u00a7 36-99.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">We reject this argument of Fairfax County. The enabling legislation, Code \u00a7 36-98, directed the State Board of Housing to adopt and promulgate a uniform statewide building code, and im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>plicit in this is the power to adopt administrative rules and procedures carrying out the building code. In <em>Portsmouth </em>v. <em>Virginia Railway and Power Company, </em>141 Va. 54, 61, 126 S.E. 362, 364 (1925), we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-4\">[E]very power expressly granted, or fairly implied from the language used, or which is necessary to enable the Commission to exercise the powers expressly granted, should and must be accorded.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">The 1977 amendment to Code \u00a7 36-99 was merely a reiteration of inherent powers possessed by the State Board of Housing.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">Fairfax County seeks to bolster its case by invoking the rule of administrative construction. To do this it presented the testimony of Jack Allen Proctor, State Building Code Inspector, together with his letter of January 17, 1978, enclosing interpretations of \u00a7\u00a7 118.7 and 118.8 of BOCA/U.S.B.C. by the Technical Review Board. In Proctor\u2019s testimony he said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-7\">Q. If the State Board of Housing had no authority in these areas, how did these areas get into the Uniform Statewide Building Code?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-8\">A. The State Board of Housing erred when it adopted the BOCA Code. They just didn\u2019t go through and purge the sections they didn\u2019t have the authority to promulgate. You know they promulgated portions of Article One as advisory in nature for these areas that never had a building code before.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b273-9\">His letter stated that \u00a7\u00a7 118.1-118.8 were not adopted by the State Board of Housing as part of the administrative procedures. The Technical Review Board concluded that the sections had not been adopted by the State Board of Housing, and therefore it lacked jurisdiction in the premises. Instead of a consistent administrative policy officially promulgated, we have nothing but confusion and inconsistencies in resolving this controversy. If the administrators themselves cannot agree on the interpretation, then their diverse views are of little value to the court. <em>Gomes </em>v. <em>City of Richmond, </em>220 Va. 449, 453, 258 S.E.2d 582, 585 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>III. <em>Applicability of Grandfather Clause.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">Fairfax County makes an alternative argument that, even if BOCA/U.S.B.C. superseded the local ordinance, by Code \u00a7 36-103<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>, the local building regulations within one year prior to September 1, 1973, had continuing vitality.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">This position was not set forth in any of the pleadings and is not properly before the court. We recently reiterated this rule in <em>Landcraft Co., Inc. </em>v. <em>Kincaid, </em>220 Va. 865, 870, 263 S.E.2d 419, 422 (1980), where we said: \u201c[Courts] have no power to adjudicate issues which are not presented by the parties in their pleadings unless the parties voluntarily try an issue beyond the pleadings.\u201d <em>See also Ted Lansing Supply Company </em>v. <em>Royal Aluminum and Construction Corporation, </em>221 Va. 1139, 1141, 277 S.E.2d 228, 229-30 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">IV. <em>Proffer of Proof.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">Fairfax County went to great lengths to describe the procedures used in application for, processing of, and issuance of the building permits. The time of employees of each department was carefully calculated in proportion to the salary to show the actual costs to the local government of the service it was providing. The trial court rejected the proffered evidence as irrelevant to the issue before it. The issue before the court was whether the state regulation superseded the local ordinance, and this did not involve any allocation of costs. Therefore the lower court was right in declining to consider it.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">Fairfax County argues that bec\u00e1use of the elaborate service provided on building permit applications, and the time and number of its employees involved, it is entitled to some consideration on a <em>quantum meruit </em>basis. But nothing in BOCA/U.S.B.C. regulation (\u00a7 118.8) or the local ordinance so provides. At the trial, Fairfax County took the position that \u201cwork actually completed\u201d and \u201cfor the incompleted work\u201d had reference to the work of county employees in processing and issuing building permits. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>trial court disagreed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The phrases \u201cwork actually completed\u201d and \u201cincompleted work\u201d obviously refer to \u201cbuilding project\u201d mentioned immediately before. We agree with the court and affirm the judgment in that regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">In conclusion, we hold that the State Board of Housing was authorized to adopt regulation \u00a7 118.8 of BOCA/U.S.B.C., that said regulation superseded the refund ordinance of Fairfax County, and that the Circuit Court of Fairfax County had jurisdiction to resolve the controversy. The judgment of the lower court will be</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b269-12\"> \u00a7 118.8 was deleted from BOCA/U.S.B.C. in 1978.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b271-7\"> Code \u00a7 36-98. <em>State Board of Housing to promulgate Statewide Code; other codes and regulations superseded. </em>\u2014 The State Board of Housing is hereby directed and empowered to adopt and promulgate a Uniform Statewide Building Code.
