The trial court sustained Smith\u2019s motion to strike Jessee\u2019s evidence of the contract on the grounds that there had been no meeting of the minds concerning the price for the labor involved and that the price Jessee claimed was \u201cexorbitant\u201d and, hence, contrary to public policy. The court, however, submitted the case to the jury on the basis of <em>quantum meruit, </em>and the jury returned a verdict for Jessee in the amount of $840.00. On appeal, Jessee challenges the trial court\u2019s ruling striking the evidence of the oral contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-11\">Jessee, a carpenter, provided the following account of his negotiations with Smith, the owner of two clothing stores. Smith and Brenda Garrett, manager of Smith\u2019s store in Norton, asked Jessee if he would do the finishing work on the interior of that store. Jessee declined to accept a price of \u201ccost plus ten percent\u201d. When approached again by Garrett, he offered to perform the work for \u201ccost plus plus twenty-five percent\u201d. He explained to Garrett that Smith would have to pay for the materials and, in addition, would have to pay him that amount plus 25% of that amount for his labor. After calling Smith at home, Garrett told him Smith had said \u201cto go ahead and start on Monday\u201d. When Jessee had completed most of the work, he presented Smith a labor bill of $2,673.26, representing 125% of the cost of the materials. Contending there had been a misunderstanding concerning the labor charge, Smith refused to pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>Smith, called as an adverse witness, disputed Jessee\u2019s account. According to Smith, Jessee had never characterized the contract as \u201ccost plus\u201d, and he and she had agreed that the cost of the labor would be 25% of the cost of the materials. When Jessee presented his bill, Smith refused to pay and offered instead to pay 25% of the materials\u2019 cost and $100.00 for gas and to give him two stuffed animals (polar bears) worth approximately $90.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">Witnesses knowledgeable in the customs of the trade testified that a \u201ccost plus ten percent\u201d contract contemplated a labor charge of 110% of the materials\u2019 cost and that a \u201ccost plus 25%\u201d contract for interior finish work was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">We agree with Jessee\u2019s contention that the trial court erred in granting Smith\u2019s motion to strike the evidence of the oral contract. In ruling as a matter of law that there had been no meeting of the minds as to the price for Jessee\u2019s services, the trial court usurped the function of the jury. It is true that \u201c[wjhere ... the material facts concerning the formation of an alleged contract are not in dispute, the issue of contract <em>vel non </em>is a question of law\u201d to be decided by the court. <em>Valjar, Inc. </em>v. <em>Maritime Terminals, </em>220 Va. 1015, 1018, 265 S.E.2d 734, 736 (1980). Where, however, \u201cdoubt exists as to the character, or, indeed, the presence or lack of representations, the determination of the precise nature and extent of the representations is a question for the jury.\u201d <em>Mullins </em>v. <em>Mingo Lime, Etc., Co., </em>176 Va. 44, 48, 10 S.E.2d 492, 493 (1940).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">Doubt exists here because the material facts are in dispute. Jessee testified that he had offered to perform the work for \u201ccost plus plus twenty-five percent\u201d; that he had explained to Garrett that this meant that Smith would have to pay for all the materials and then, for his services, would have to pay him that amount of money, plus 25% of that aifiount; and that Smith had accepted his offer. Smith denied she had agreed to such terms, but Garrett was never called to contradict Jessee\u2019s testimony. If the jurors believed Jessee\u2019s testimony, they could have concluded that an agreement had been reached. Because the .material facts concerning the formation of the alleged contract were in dispute, the trial court erred in holding as a matter of law that there had been no meeting of the minds.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-8\">We are also of opinion the trial court erred in ruling that the contract was unenforceable on the ground of public policy. \u201c[T]he law looks with favor upon the making of contracts between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>competent parties upon valid consideration and for lawful purposes, and \u2018courts are averse to holding contracts unenforceable on the ground of public policy unless their illegality is clear and certain.\u201d\u2019 <em>Ryan </em>v. <em>Griffin, </em>199 Va. 891, 895, 103 S.E.2d 240, 244 (1958), quoting <em>Wallihan </em>v. <em>Hughes, </em>196 Va. 117, 125, 82 S.E.2d 553, 558 (1954). The trial judge reasoned that the contract was unenforceable because the labor charge was \u201cexorbitant\u201d. In cases involving sales of goods, some courts have been willing to examine the adequacy of the consideration in determining whether the transaction was \u201cunconscionable\u201d under Uniform Commercial Code \u00a7 2-302. <em>See </em>Annot., 18 A.L.R.3d 1305 (1968 &amp; Supp.). The general rule, however, is that \u201cparties to transactions are free to fix their own valuations\u201d, Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 81 comment c (Tent. Draft No. 2 1965), and courts will not inquire into the adequacy of consideration, particularly when one or both of the values exchanged are variable or otherwise difficult to measure. That one party rues the bargain he struck does not excuse his performance. \u201cCourts cannot relieve one of the consequences of a contract merely because it was unwise.\u201d <em>Owens </em>v. <em>Owens, </em>196 Va. 966, 974, 86 S.E.2d 181, 186 (1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">Where, of course, the consideration is so inadequate as to shock the conscience of a court of equity, the chancellor should scrutinize the transaction for actual or constructive fraud or duress. <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Seymour, </em>193 Va. 735, 741, 71 S.E.2d 181, 185 (1952). But this is a case at law, and we find nothing in this record to suggest fraud or duress. Both Jessee and Smith were experienced in business and capable of making their own valuations of the services Jessee was to provide. It was error for the trial court to substitute its value judgment for theirs.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">Because the trial court failed to submit the contract question to the jury, we will reverse the judgment and remand the case for a new trial, if the parties be so advised.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
