J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AZc\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-10\">This appeal involves a claim for a cost-of-living supplement under \u00a7 65.1-99.1<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of the Virginia Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>This section provides that such a supplement shall be payable to certain recipients of compensation awards, \u201cin addition to the other benefits\u201d payable under the Act, if the employee\u2019s combined workmen\u2019s compensation and social security entitlement is less than 80% of his average monthly earnings before disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">The claimant, Homer Anderson, an employee of Clinchfield Coal Company, was injured permanently in an industrial accident on July 18, 1978. Pursuant to agreement, he was awarded compensation benefits for total incapacity in the amount of $187 per week.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">Responsive to the mandate of \u00a7 65.1-99.1, the Industrial Commission fixed 9% as the rate of cost-of-living supplements effective October 1, 1979. In December, 1979, Anderson applied for a cost-of-living supplement. He established his qualifications for an increase under \u00a7 65.1-99.1, and the Commission allowed him the 9% supplement. Clinchfield has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">Clinchfield contends the award of the full 9% increase is erroneous. Under Code \u00a7 65.1-54,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Clinchfield points out, income bene<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>fits for total incapacity \u201cshall not exceed\u201d the amount of \u201cthe average weekly wage of the Commonwealth.\u201d The $187 per week originally awarded Anderson, Clinchfield notes, equaled the then current average weekly wage of the Commonwealth; since that time, the average weekly wage of the Commonwealth has increased, resulting in higher benefit awards to later-injured employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\">\u201c[T]he cost of living supplement was intended,\u201d Clinchfield argues, \u201cto bring claimants previously injured closer to the status of presently injured employees, if possible, but not to provide for greater benefits.\u201d The Commission\u2019s action, Clinchfield asserts, thwarts the legislative intent, as demonstrated by the following analysis: Because he was injured July 18, 1978, Anderson was entitled to a cost-of-living increase on October 1, 1979. An increase of <em>9%, </em>when added to benefits he already was receiving, would provide Anderson a total award exceeding the amount allowed an employee injured after October 1, 1979. This later-injured employee would receive weekly benefits of only $199, the average weekly wage of the Commonwealth applicable to accidents occurring between July 1, 1979, and July 1, 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">We can correct this unintended imbalance, Clinchfield asserts, by application of the general rule of construction that, if reasonably possible, a statute should be interpreted to give it effect as a whole. By applying this rule, Clinchfield opines, we can give effect to both the \u201cin addition to\u201d language of \u00a7 65.1-99.1 and the \u201cshall not exceed\u201d wording of \u00a7 65.1-54. Accordingly, Clinchfield concludes, we should construe the Act to allow benefits up to, but not in excess of, the maximum rate, with the result that Anderson\u2019s award should be reduced to $199 per week.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">We do not agree with Clinchfield\u2019s construction of the Code sections in question. Reviewing the sections, we find that, in a given year, the availability of cost-of-living supplements is based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>upon a determination whether there has been an increase in the Consumer Price Index, rather than a change in the average weekly wage of the Commonwealth. Further, once the supplement becomes available, eligibility therefor is tied to a formula in which the average wage of the claimant, rather than the average wage of the Commonwealth, is the determinative factor. And, although a supplement has been allowed, it later may be reduced if the Consumer Price Index falls, even though the average weekly wage of the Commonwealth may rise, in the determinative period.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">More important, \u00a7 65.1-99.1 clearly states that cost-of-living supplements shall be \u201cin addition to the other benefits\u201d payable under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. One of the other benefits payable under the Act is provided by \u00a7 65.1-54 in the form of compensation for total incapacity up to the amount of the average weekly wage of the Commonwealth. Adoption of Clinchfield\u2019s argument that the amount of cost-of-living supplements is limited by the average weekly wage of the Commonwealth would require either writing out of \u00a7 65.1-99.1 the \u201cin addition to\u201d language or writing into the section a provision making this language subject to the \u201cshall not exceed\u201d wording of \u00a7 65.1-54. We decline to pursue either course.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">The General Assembly, Clinchfield says, has now written into \u00a7 65.1-99.1 just such a limiting provision and thereby has \u201cperhaps best illuminated\u201d its original intention \u201cnot to provide greater benefit to formerly injured employees than to those injured at the present.\u201d In this connection, Clinchfield refers to an amendment to \u00a7 65.1-99.1,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> adopted at the 1981 session of the General Assembly and not yet effective, which provides that \u201ccompensation paid the claimant under this section shall at no time exceed the then current maximum weekly amount payable under \u00a7 65.1-54.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">We disagree with Clinchfield concerning the value of the 1981 amendment as an indicator of prior legislative intent. If, as Clinchfield contends, the General Assembly originally intended to limit total compensation benefits to the amount of the average weekly wage of the Commonwealth, it would have employed the language later used in the 1981 amendment. This language was as readily available when \u00a7 65.1-99.1 was enacted in 1975 as it was in the early part of this year, when the amendment was adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>More likely, the 1981 amendment resulted, not from a desire to state an intention ex post facto, but from recognition of a phenomenon, cited here by Clinchfield: In the 1978-79 period, the cost of living, for the first time since \u00a7 65.1-99.1 was enacted, rose at a greater rate than the average weekly wage of the Commonwealth. This phenomenon, and not a misconstruction of the applicable statutory provisions by the Commission, caused Anderson\u2019s total compensation benefits, at least temporarily, to exceed those payable to an employee injured later than Anderson,</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\">We believe the statutory provisions applicable to this case express the clear intention that a full cost-of-living supplement is payable even though its allowance causes a claimant\u2019s total compensation benefits to exceed the average weekly wage of the Commonwealth current at the time of allowance. Accordingly, our conclusion is to affirm the award of the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b99-11\"> \u00a7 65.1-99.1.

The average annual wage thus obtained shall be divided by fifty-two and the average weekly wage thus determined rounded to the nearest dollar. The average weekly wage as so determined shall be applicable for the full period during which income benefits are payable, when the date of occurrence of injury or of disablement in the case of disease falls within the year commencing with the July one, following the date of determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>The minimum or the maximum weekly income benefits shall not be changed for any year unless the computation herein provided results in an increase or decrease of two dollars or more, raised to the next even dollar in the level of the minimum or the maximum weekly income benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">In no case shall the period covered by such compensation be greater than five hundred weeks, nor shall the total amount of all compensation exceed the result obtained by multiplying the average weekly wage of the Commonwealth as defined herein for the applicable year by five hundred, except that weekly compensation on account of total and permanent incapacity as defined by \u00a7 65.1-56(18) shall continue for the lifetime of the injured employee without limit as to total amount.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b102-7\"> Acts 1981, c. 265.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
