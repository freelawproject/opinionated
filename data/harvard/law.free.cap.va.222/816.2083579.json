Taylor guilty of grand larceny and fixed his punishment at six months in jail plus a fine of $500. He appeals the trial court\u2019s September 1980 judgment of conviction confirming the jury\u2019s finding and sentencing defendant in conformity with the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-9\">The sole issue on appeal is whether the court below properly denied defendant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence discovered as the result of a warrantless search of a truck standing on a public highway. More precisely, the dispositive inquiry is whether there was probable cause to believe the vehicle contained the fruits of a crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-10\">Just before midnight on January 30, 1980, State Trooper P. T. Spencer, Jr., was patrolling in his police cruiser on Route 33 in the Town of Louisa. Town Officer Kenny James Harper was riding with Spencer. Snow was falling and the weather conditions were \u201cnasty.\u201d As Spencer drove east near the intersection of Routes 33 and 22, he observed a two-and-one-half-ton truck, with an enclosed body containing no exterior lettering, parked headed west on Route 22. The truck entirely blocked the westbound lane with its left wheels within one foot of the double solid lines marking the center of the highway. Spencer turned, drove through a shopping center parking lot, \u201ccame in behind\u201d the large white and silver truck, and stopped to its rear. The truck\u2019s \u201cmotor was running and the lights were on,\u201d but no \u201cemergency flashers\u201d were in use.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-11\">As the trooper alighted from his vehicle, he observed that no person was on the \u201cdriver\u2019s side\u201d of the truck cab. Approaching that side, Spencer found LeRoy Washington sitting on the \u201cpassenger\u2019s side\u201d of the vehicle. When asked by the officer \u201cwhat the problem was,\u201d Washington replied that the driver was talking to friends near a Ford Mustang automobile parked in the shopping center lot. Spencer looked across the road, observed the Mustang <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>about 100-200 feet away, and saw defendant Taylor walk from the car through the lot towards him.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">Taylor proceeded across the road to where Spencer was standing beside the truck. Upon being asked by the officer \u201cwhat the problem was,\u201d defendant said he had stopped to converse with \u201cfriends\u201d and that he was preparing to \u201cmove on.\u201d The trooper asked Taylor for his operator\u2019s license; he replied that he had none \u201cwith him.\u201d Spencer asked defendant \u201cif he had any identification;\u201d the accused said he did not. The officer asked Taylor who owned the truck; defendant replied his sister-in-law had rented the truck. Upon Spencer\u2019s request for \u201cthe rental papers,\u201d defendant handed him a carbon copy of an Avis-Rent-A-Car \u201cbill.\u201d The only handwriting legible in any of the numerous blank spaces on the pre-printed form was the signature \u201cGaynelle Baird.\u201d Spencer testified that Taylor \u201chad nothing with him to indicate who he was or that he was supposed to have possession of the vehicle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">The trooper then inquired of defendant \u201cwhere he was coming from\u201d; Taylor replied he did not know. He also said he \u201cdidn\u2019t know where he was going.\u201d The officer asked how defendant acquired possession of the truck; Taylor responded that \u201che just picked it up on [the] side [of] the road and did not know exactly where.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b854-7\">The officer then observed that the 1978-model truck appeared to be in good mechanical condition. But when he looked at the left rear wheels, the truck\u2019s springs on the left side were depressed to the point that the truck body was almost touching the left rear tires. At that location the highway from side to side was level. The officer then asked defendant \u201cwhat was in the truck;\u201d the accused responded \u201cit was empty.\u201d When Spencer called the truck\u2019s tilt to defendant\u2019s attention, Taylor said \u201cit was always like that.\u201d From his police experience in weighing vehicles, the trooper knew that the truck had \u201can exceptional amount of weight\u201d on the left side. Spencer also noticed that the truck had a hydraulic lift on the rear which, he said, \u201cis ideal for stealing something.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b854-8\">The officer then placed defendant under arrest for the traffic infraction of stopping a motor vehicle on a public highway in such a manner as to impede or render dangerous the use of the highway by others. Code \u00a7\u00a7 46.1-248 and -16.01. The trooper put defendant in the custody of Town Officer Harper who had remained at the police vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>Spencer returned to the truck cab and talked to Washington, who also had no operator\u2019s license and no identification, also did not know where he and defendant had come from, also was unaware where they had \u201cpicked up\u201d the truck, and also claimed the truck was empty. Washington was then taken back to the police car so the town officer could \u201cwatch\u201d him. Because he was confronted with, \u201ctwo extremely nervous individuals,\u201d Spencer asked Harper to call by radio for additional officers \u201cto take care of\u2019 the individuals, five in number, who were at the Mustang in the parking lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">Realizing the police on the scene were outnumbered seven to two and that the five persons at the Mustang were friends of both defendant and Washington, the trooper, describing the circumstances as \u201ca very volatile situation,\u201d decided to examine without a warrant the inside of the truck\u2019s rear compartment. Spencer said that, based on his experience of 11 years as a police officer, he was \u201csure\u201d the vehicle contained stolen property. He also testified that he felt it was important to conduct the search at that time before the individuals in the Mustang could drive away. After defendant refused to comply with Spencer\u2019s request to open the rear of the truck, the trooper raised the unlocked rear door.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">Upon looking into the compartment, Spencer saw a yellow flashlight and a red \u201cton and a half come-along,\u201d described as a type of block and tackle used to move heavy equipment. He also observed at the left front corner of the storage area a large wooden spool wrapped with new, heavy aluminum wire, which, upon investigation, was found to belong to the Virginia Electric and Power Company. The wire, having a steel core, was about 6000 feet long, weighed about 3000 pounds and was valued in excess of $2100. The spool was standing on its rims and was being braced by a wooden site sign from a VEPCO storage facility located near Mineral in Louisa County.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-7\">Shortly after Spencer had completed his examination of the rear of the truck, a number of additional officers arrived. The seven individuals at the scene were arrested and charged with larceny of the wire.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-8\">Subsequent investigation and the evidence revealed that earlier during the day in question defendant and one of the accomplices sent Gaynelle Baird, defendant\u2019s sister-in-law, to Charlottesville with $100 cash to rent a truck for them. They told her the truck was to be used to haul furniture. After completing the transaction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>at the Avis Company, Baird handed the keys to the truck and the rental receipt to defendant. By prearrangement, the group of seven men arrived at the storage facility, an open field, in the Mustang and the truck between 8:00 p.m. and 10:00 p.m. to steal the wire. After laboring about one and one-half hours at the site, the crew was finally able manually to hoist one spool of wire from the ground into the truck; they tried to employ the hydraulic lift but the weight of the wire prevented its use. The two vehicles were driven from the scene of the crime directly to Louisia where the arrests took place.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">Following a pretrial hearing, the trial court overruled defendant\u2019s motion to suppress all evidence obtained during the search of the truck and all other evidence derived from the alleged illegal search. On appeal, defendant argues the lower court erred because the warrantless search of the rented vehicle was illegal as not justified by any exception to the Fourth Amendment warrant requirement. We do not agree; we hold the officer acted upon probable cause in exigent circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-6\">One of the established exceptions to the warrant requirement is that if a search without a warrant is made of an automobile or other vehicle on the highway upon probable cause and if it is not practicable to secure a warrant because the motor vehicle can be quickly moved out of the locality or jurisdiction in which the warrant must be sought, the search is valid. <em>Carroll </em>v. <em>United States, </em>267 U.S. 132, 149, 153 (1925). In this case, defendant understandably does not dispute the fact that exigent circmstances were present at the time. Instead, he contends the officer lacked probable cause to search the truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-7\">The legal standard of probable cause, as the term suggests, relates to probabilities that are based upon the factual and practical considerations in everyday life as perceived by reasonable and prudent persons. The presence or absence of probable cause is not to be examined from the perspective of a legal technician. Rather, probable cause exists when the facts and circumstances within the officer\u2019s knowledge, and of which he has reasonably trustworthy information, alone are sufficient to warrant a person of reasonable caution to believe that an offense has been or is being committed. <em>Draper </em>v. <em>United States, </em>358 U.S. 307, 313 (1959); <em>Schaum </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>215 Va. 498, 500, 211 S.E.2d 73, 75 (1975). In order to ascertain whether probable cause exists, courts will focus upon \u201cwhat the totality of the circumstances meant to police of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>fleers trained in analyzing the observed conduct for purposes of crime control.\u201d <em>Hollis </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>216 Va. 874, 877, 223 S.E.2d 887, 889 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">In articulating his contention that probable cause was lacking, defendant says that, admittedly, the officer could \u201cguess\u201d the truck was loaded based on the depressed springs. However, defendant argues, there was \u201cnothing connecting the fact that it was loaded to the fact that it was loaded with contraband as opposed to furniture or other legal material.\u201d Defendant notes that neither Trooper Spencer nor Officer Harper had been made aware of any alleged unlawful activity by defendant or his accomplices, other than the improper stopping of the vehicle. He points out that the police were not on the lookout for these individuals or this particular truck. Defendant contends the \u201csole basis\u201d for the search was the belief the truck was loaded with \u201csomething\u201d and defendant\u2019s denial that it was, in fact, loaded. He argues that Trooper Spencer\u2019s \u201csuspicion\u201d that the truck contained stolen goods was \u201cclearly no more than a hunch on his part\u201d and factually is insufficient to establish probable cause. We disagree with defendant\u2019s analysis of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-6\">At this appellate stage of the proceedings we examine the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth. From that perspective, we turn to the facts and consider what the totality of these circumstances meant to a police officer trained to interpret human conduct for the purpose of law enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-7\">Trooper Spencer was confronted at night in \u201cnasty\u201d weather with an unmarked truck blocking an entire travel lane of a public highway. The truck had its motor running and its lights were burning. It was in apparent good mechanical condition, equipped with a hydraulic lift that was \u201cideal for stealing something.\u201d Both occupants were \u201cextremely\u201d nervous. They professed to have no operator\u2019s licenses and no identification. They said they did not know where they had been or where they had obtained possession of the vehicle. The document offered to corroborate the fact the vehicle was leased to defendant\u2019s relative furnished no information about the rental; that fact was apparent from a mere glance at the paper. The occupants maintained that the vehicle was empty; yet it obviously was loaded. Near the truck and its occupants was a group of five \u201cfriends,\u201d congregated around another motor vehicle, who remained aloof during questioning of defendant and Wash<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>ington. As the trooper viewed the situation, it was \u201cvery volatile\u201d and \u201cthe vehicle was under extreme suspicious circumstances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">We conclude that those facts, taken as a whole in that setting as viewed by a trained police officer were sufficient to believe the truck probably contained stolen property. <em>See Adkins </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>218 Va. 945, 948, 243 S.E.2d 205, 207 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b858-6\">The case of <em>Matthews </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>218 Va. 1, 235 S.E.2d 306 (1977), relied on by defendant, is inapposite. There, a state trooper stopped the defendant for a traffic violation. While talking to the motorist, the officer observed a pack of cigarette wrapping paper on the floorboard of defendant\u2019s car. After examining the paper, the trooper looked further and discovered a folded brown paper bag tucked beside the driver\u2019s seat. Upon picking up and opening the bag, the officer discovered a quantity of marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-7\">We reversed defendant\u2019s conviction for possessing the substance, holding the search and seizure of the bag was illegal. We held the trooper lacked probable cause to believe defendant possessed marijuana. We noted that the police officer made \u201csome connection\u201d between the cigarette papers, sometimes used for illegal purposes, and the brown bag. We said, however, that \u201cthe connection was not combined with any other circumstances which might have justified a rational belief that the bag contained contraband drugs.\u201d 218 Va. at 3, 235 S.E.2d at 307.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-8\">But in the present case, contrary to defendant\u2019s argument, the obvious fact, denied by the occupants, that the vehicle was loaded was combined with the many other circumstances that we have enumerated to justify a rational belief that the truck contained fruits of a crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-9\">For these reasons the judgment appealed from will be</p>\n<p id=\"b858-10\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
