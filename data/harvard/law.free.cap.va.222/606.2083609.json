On appeal, he contends that the trial court erred in granting, over his objection, an instruction which read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-10\">The Court instructs the jury that where the killing, although intentional, is done in passion in the [heat] of blood, upon sudden provocation by gross indignity, the law reduces the offense to manslaughter. But, however great the provocation may have been, if there has been a sufficient time for passion to subside and for reason to return, the homicide is murder.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b643-11\">Timothy Kevin King\u2019s body was found at approximately 10 p.m. on February 14, 1980, alongside a Warren County road about five miles from the residence he shared with his wife, Barbara. An autopsy revealed ten stab wounds in King\u2019s chest and back, three of which penetrated his lungs, and a number of lacerations and contusions of the head and face. According to the medical examiner, death resulted from numerous blows to the head with a blunt instrument. The cumulative effect of these blows, which caused skull fractures and damage to the brain, would have been immediate unconsciousness followed by death at an indeterminate time thereafter. The examiner estimated the time of death to be 9:30 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-12\">Police officers described the scene where the body was found and the condition of King\u2019s van, which was found several miles away. Both revealed signs of a struggle. A police officer testified that the van was \u201cvery bloody,\u201d both inside and out, and in a state of disarray. In addition to the extensive bloodstains on the road, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>hair and flesh were found some twenty feet away from the body. King\u2019s bloody hunting knife was discovered in close proximity to his body.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">Five days after the killing, the defendant was questioned, and he made a statement to the police. Potter said that his car broke down on the night of February 14, 1980, and he walked to the nearby King house seeking transportation. Defendant approached King and asked for \u201ca ride home.\u201d King, who recognized Potter, agreed, and the two men left the premises in King\u2019s van. According to Potter\u2019s statement, King, who was driving the van, deviated from the proper route to Potter\u2019s home. Defendant said that when asked why he was doing this, King replied, \u201cwe will go this way for a few minutes.\u201d Potter\u2019s signed statement continued as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-6\">Then he looked at me and asked if I had an [affair] with Barbara. I said no, we were just [friends]. He then pulled off to the right on a road just past the bridge. Tim kept saying that I did. I kept telling him to take me home, I reached for the door handle so I could jump out and run, and he pulled out an orange or red knife about 5 inches long and grabbed me with the other hand. I then grabbed his arm that had the knife in it to keep him from stabbing me. We then wrestled around in the front of the van for a few seconds and I felt something under my feet. I picked it up and swung it still holding on to Tim\u2019s arm. The item I picked up was a heavy metal object. With the first swing I struck Tim in the forehead with the object. I just kept [swinging] the object and hit Tim 3 or 4 more times. Tim was bleeding at this time. At this time both of us came out of the van on the passenger side, we were still struggling. While we were coming out of the van I dropped the heavy metal object and Tim dropped the knife. Once I saw the heavy metal object on the ground I knew it was a tire-iron. At this time Tim was reaching down on the ground and I picked up the knife. We were both on our knees. At this time I stabbed Tim with his knife about 3 times, and threw the knife down. Tim then got up and fell up against the bank. I then picked up the tire tool and hit Tim in the head I don\u2019t know how many times. I then got back in the van and went up the road a little and turned around. I did bang the front of the van into the bank. After turning the van around I was terrified and crying and wanted to get out <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>of there. Coming back down the road it felt like I hit something, but I don\u2019t know what it was. . . ,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">Potter said he drove King\u2019s van back to the area near his car, \u201cgot [the car] cranked and [rode] around to get my head straight. The next thing I remember is when I got home.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">Defendant and Barbara King worked together at Warren Memorial Hospital. Although Potter denied having an illicit relationship with Mrs. King, Dale Butler, a friend of Potter\u2019s, testified that Potter said he was dating a married woman named Barbara who had a child.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Additionally, defendant told police that he and Barbara King had \u201cridden around\u201d the evening of the homicide. Mrs. King invoked her Fifth Amendment privilege and declined to answer questions about her actions on February 14, 1980. She also declined to answer questions about her relationship with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">The statement given by Potter was the only evidence available to the Commonwealth showing the circumstances surrounding the altercation which led to King\u2019s death. The defendant did not testify, and there were no other witnesses to the killing. While there w\u00e1s testimony that an individual fitting Potter\u2019s description was in the vicinity, no one positively identified Potter as that individual.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-8\">Defendant contends that there is no evidence of any cooling period, or \u201cany lapse of time between the commencement of the combat [between defendant and King] and the delivery of the mortal stroke to the deceased by the accused.\u201d Potter argues the evidence shows that he reacted in self-defense to King\u2019s aggressive actions, and that King\u2019s actions caused a sudden transport of passion in him which resulted in the killing of King.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b645-9\">The Commonwealth\u2019s position is that the provocation in this case is slight. It asserts that there is ample evidence to support the inference that defendant was Mrs. King\u2019s lover and that defendant willingly and knowingly placed himself in a position of confrontation with the decedent. The Attorney General argues that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>defendant could have left the van when it stopped, or fled the scene while King was on his knees. Pointing to the ten stab wounds and the number of blows delivered to decedent\u2019s head, the Commonwealth maintains \u201c[tjhere was no mutual combat in this killing,\u201d rather the death resulted from \u201cthe systematic bludgeoning of a helpless individual.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">We find no objection to the first sentence of the challenged instruction because there is ample evidence to support an instruction on manslaughter. However, the only direct evidence of the events culminating in King\u2019s death is found in defendant\u2019s statement. While the jury was not compelled to accept the entire statement as true, there is nothing therein from which a jury could find or infer that there was a cessation of hostilities between the commencement of the struggle and defendant\u2019s flight from the scene. Potter, through his statement, claimed that the fight commenced in the van and continued until his repeated blows debilitated King. No evidence which contradicted this claim was introduced.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">The question before us is whether the trial court erred in instructing the jury that \u201cif there has been a sufficient time for passion to subside and for reason to return, the homicide is murder.\u201d A cooling period contemplates time and opportunity for passion to subside. The challenged instruction invited the jury to conclude that because the fight lasted for several minutes, \u201ca sufficient time elapsed for passion to subside and reason to return.\u201d While the sufficiency of time for cooling is a question of fact to be decided by the jury, the time to be considered is the interval between the provocation and the act, not the time during which the <em>furor brevis </em>controls.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">In <em>M\u2019Whirt\u2019s Case, </em>44 Va. (3 Gratt.) 594 (1846), some twenty-four hours elapsed between the alleged provocation and the homicide. In <em>Crockett </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>187 Va. 687, 47 S.E.2d 377 (1948), three hours passed between the provocation and the homicide. There, the court observed that a jury question was presented as to whether a sufficient time had elapsed for passion to have subsided. And in <em>McClung </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>215 Va. 654, 212 S.E.2d 290 (1975), the provocation preceding the homicide had occurred over a period of two years and consisted of innumerable abusive and harassing acts by the decedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-8\">The Commonwealth\u2019s contention that there were two fights, one inside the van and another outside, is not supported by the evidence. According to Potter\u2019s statement, the struggle began in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>van, progressed through the passenger door, and continued in the area around the van to its finish. The only evidence presented at trial showed that there was a continuous fight which resulted in King\u2019s death. There is no evidence here which supports the \u201ccooling instruction\u201d given by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">We find no merit in the Commonwealth\u2019s argument that the granting of the instruction, while prejudicial, was harmless error. The instruction permitted the jury to convict defendant of second degree murder, provided there had been \u201csufficient time for passion to subside and reason to return.\u201d While the giving of an instruction on second degree murder was proper, the defendant was also entitled to a proper instruction defining manslaughter, unencumbered by any reference to a \u201ccooling period\u201d which the evidence showed did not exist. As we pointed out in <em>McClung, supra, </em>\u201c[i]t is . . . immaterial that the jury did not believe that the defendant killed in self defense as defined in the instruction they heard.\u201d 215 Va. at 657, 212 S.E.2d at 293. \u201cThe plea of self-defense and of passion ... are not in conflict with each other.\u201d <em>Wilkins </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>176 Va. 580, 583, 11 S.E.2d 653, 655 (1943). Therefore the jury\u2019s rejection of Potter\u2019s defense of self-defense does not necessarily indicate it also rejected his defense of passion. Had the jury been properly instructed on voluntary manslaughter, it could have found that this homicide met that definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">For the error in granting the instruction complained of, the defendant\u2019s conviction will be reversed, and the case will be remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b645-10\"> The medical examiner did not testify that a vehicle inflicted any injury on the decedent. The Commonwealth does not contend that the decedent died as the result of such an injury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b645-11\"> Barbara King testified that she and her husband had one child.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b645-12\"> King was twenty-five years old, weighed approximately 190 pounds and was six feet tall. Potter, a high school student at the time of the killing, was eighteen years old, weighed 155 pounds and was five feet eleven and one-half inches tall.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
