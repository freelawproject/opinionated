Johnson, from selling alcoholic beverages for on-premises consumption until Tiny House had obtained the use permit required by Norfolk City Ordinance 28,759, adopted February 1, 1977 (hereinafter referred to as the Ordinance). The trial court held that the Ordinance infringed upon the exclusive authority delegated to the Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission and dismissed the City\u2019s bill of complaint. In this appeal we decide if the City, in the exercise of its police power, may enact a zoning ordinance regulating the location of an establishment selling alcoholic beverages.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>Tiny House, a restaurant located in a C-2 district of Norfolk, desired to sell beer for on-premises consumption and on February 20, 1977, applied for the use permit required in the district by the Ordinance. The City Planning Commission, after a public hearing on March 18, 1977, recommended to the City Manager that the use permit be denied. On April 4, 1977, while City Council action on the recommendation was still pending, Tiny House withdrew its application. It has never been denied the use permit. Subsequently, on April 18, 1977, the ABC Commission, over the City\u2019s objection, issued the restaurant a license to serve beer for on-premises consumption. Tiny House then commenced selling beer without obtaining the City\u2019s use permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">Norfolk filed a bill of complaint seeking injunctive relief, and Tiny House responded with an answer and cross-bill alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>that the Ordinance was null and void because the ABC Commission had \u201cexclusive authority ... to regulate or control the sale or use of alcoholic beverages.\u201d The trial court, after reviewing the statutes granting the ABC Commission its powers, found evidence of a legislative intent \u201cto limit local authority\u201d in matters pertaining the location and concentration of establishments selling alcoholic beverages.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thereupon, the court held that the City was \u201coutside the delegated authority granted it by the General Assembly\u201d in enacting the zoning ordinance under attack because \u201csuch authority [was deposited] exclusively with the [ABC] Commission.\u201d It declared the Ordinance null and void \u201cinsofar as it regulates the location and concentration of establishments selling [alcoholic beverages]\u201d and dismissed the City\u2019s bill of complaint. There was no ruling by the court on the cross-bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">Code \u00a7\u00a7 15.1-427 to -503.2 grant to municipalities the power to adopt zoning ordinances. Code \u00a7 15.1-427 states that \u201c[t]his chapter is intended to encourage local governments to improve public health, safety, convenience and welfare of its citizens and to plan for the future development of communities to the end that . . . residential areas be provided with healthy surroundings for family life.\u201d The general purpose of zoning ordinances is the promotion of \u201chealth, safety or general welfare of the public and of further accomplishing the objectives of \u00a7 15.1-427.\u201d Code \u00a7 15.1-489. To accomplish these ends, ordinances are to be designed \u201cto facilitate the creation of a convenient, attractive and harmoni<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>ous community.\u201d Code \u00a7 15.1-489(3). The General Assembly, in Code \u00a7 15.1-486, granted municipalities jurisdiction in each zoning district to regulate, restrict, permit, prohibit, and determine the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-4\">(a) The use of land, buildings, structures and other premises for agricultural, business, industrial, residential. . . and other specific uses;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-5\">(b) The size, height, area, bulk, location, erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration, repair, maintenance, razing, or removal of structures;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-6\">(c) The areas and dimensions of land ... to be occupied by buildings, structures and uses. . . .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">The Ordinance defined several businesses as constituting \u201cadult uses.\u201d It included as an adult use any establishment which had as a principal or accessory function the sale of alcoholic beverages for on-premises consumption and which required a retail on-premises license from the ABC Commission.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The City Council recognized \u201cserious objectionable operational characteristics\u201d inherent in adult uses, \u201cparticularly when several of them are concentrated ... or located in direct proximity to residential neighborhoods,\u201d and enacted special regulations to prevent a concentration of adult uses that would create adverse effects on residential areas. Among the regulations provided by the Ordinance was the requirement that a use permit be obtained and that \u201cno more than two such [adult] uses shall be located within 1,000 feet of each other.\u201d City Council was authorized to waive this requirement provided certain circumstances existed and certain stated findings were made.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">Tiny House argues that it was \u201cgrandfathered\u201d under the Ordinance or that its use constituted a nonconforming one and that it need not obtain a use permit. It points to amendments of the Ordinance and asserts that \u201cthe original version of Ordinance No. 28,759 did <em>not </em>accomplish the council\u2019s goal of requiring a use permit in a C-2 zone where the sale of alcohol is allowed as acces<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>sory to a permitted use (restaurant).\u201d While the language of the Ordinance in Sections 2:613.2(l)-(3) appeared to provide exemptions to the use permit requirement regarding establishments providing on-premises consumption of alcohol, subsection (4) of Section 2:613.2 provided no exception for these establishments. When read with the prefatory clause of Section 2:613.2 of the Ordinance, it is clear that subsection (4) thereof required a use permit for adult uses located within 1,000 feet of one another unless the requirement was waived by City Council, as provided in Section 2:613.2(5)(a-d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Testimony at trial revealed that Tiny House was situated within 1,000 feet of other adult uses. It was therefore required to obtain the use permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">There is \u201ca presumption favoring the validity of municipal ordinances, and the presumption governs unless it is overcome by unreasonableness apparent on the face of the ordinance or by extrinsic evidence which clearly establishes the unreasonableness.\u201d <em>Kisley </em>v. <em>City of Falls Church, </em>212 Va. 693, 697, 187 S.E.2d 168, 171, <em>appeal dismissed, </em>409 U.S. 907 (1972). \u201cWhether a particular ordinance enacted pursuant to a general grant of power is void as arbitrary and unreasonable is a question of law for the courts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The United States Supreme Court, in <em>Young </em>v. <em>American Mini Theatres, Inc., </em>427 U.S. 50 (1976), upheld the validity of a Detroit zoning ordinance prohibiting two regulated uses within 1,000 feet of one another. Those challenging the Detroit ordinance did so on the ground that the ordinance violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. This contention was rejected by the Court. It said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-5\">It is true, however, that adult films may only be exhibited commercially in licensed theaters. But that is also true of all motion pictures. The city\u2019s general zoning laws require all motion picture theaters to satisfy certain locational as well as other requirements; we have no doubt that the municipality may control the location of theaters as well as the location of other commercial establishments, either by confining them to certain specified commercial zones or by requiring that they be dispersed throughout the city. The mere fact that the commercial exploitation of material protected by the First Amendment is subject to zoning and other licensing require<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>ments is not a sufficient reason for invalidating these ordinances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-4\">Putting to one side for the moment the fact that adult motion picture theaters must satisfy a locational restriction not applicable to other theaters, we are also persuaded that the 1,000-foot restriction does not, in itself, create an impermissible restraint on protected communication. The city\u2019s interest in planning and regulating the use of property for commercial purposes is clearly adequate to support that kind of restriction applicable to all theaters within the city limits.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">427 U.S. at 62-63.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">In the instant case, counsel for Tiny House acknowledged that the rights of Tiny House, allegedly infringed upon by the challenged Ordinance, are of lesser dignity than First Amendment rights. The effect of the holding in <em>Young </em>is that a municipality\u2019s police power, exerted through its zoning regulations, may be broad enough to limit First Amendment rights. If a locality\u2019s police power is that broad, then assuredly it can restrict rights of lesser dignity, such as those asserted by Tiny House. We hold that the City\u2019s Ordinance was a proper exercise of its police power and that the Ordinance is not arbitrary or unreasonable. Our position is aptly summarized in <em>Young, </em>where it was said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-7\">The remaining question is whether the line drawn by these ordinances is justified by the city\u2019s interest in preserving the character of its neighborhoods. . . . The. record discloses a factual basis for the Common Council\u2019s conclusion that this kind of restriction will have the desired effect. It is not our function to appraise the wisdom of its decision to require adult theaters to be separated rather than concentrated in the same areas. In either event, the city\u2019s interest in attempting to preserve the quality of urban life is one that must be accorded high respect. Moreover, the city must be allowed a reasonable opportunity to experiment with solutions to admittedly serious problems.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-8\">Since what is ultimately at stake is nothing more than a limitation on the place where adult films may be exhibited, even though the determination of whether a particular film fits that characterization turns on the nature of its content, we conclude that the city\u2019s interest in the present and future <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>character of its neighborhoods adequately supports its classification of motion pictures, [footnotes omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">427 U.S. at 71-72.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">Tiny House argues that even though the City\u2019s Ordinance may be a legitimate exercise of its police power, the City may not regulate the location and concentration of establishments selling alcoholic beverages. It submits that the General Assembly granted this exclusive authority to the ABC Commission. In support of its position, Tiny House cites numerous cases which stand for the proposition that when a city ordinance conflicts with a state statute, the state statute will prevail.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>It then argues that \u201ca reading of the Virginia Alcoholic Beverage Control Act in its entirety [demonstrates] that the state.legislature intended to control the whole of the law . . . relating to and concerning alcohlic beverages.\u201d The City responds by citing numerous cases from other jurisdictions in which zoning legislation affecting the location of establishments selling alcoholic beverages was held valid.\u00ae</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">We agree that in conflicts between state law and municipal law, state law must control. We reject Tiny House\u2019s contention that the General Assembly, by enacting the ABC Act, intended to prohibit local governments from utilizing zoning as a means of controlling the location and concentration of establishments selling alcoholic beverages.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">In <em>Maritime Union </em>v. <em>City of Norfolk, </em>202 Va. 672, 119 S.E.2d 307 (1961), we held that Congress, through the National Labor Relations Act, had \u201cnot occupied and closed the field of labor relations affecting interstate commerce to the exclusion of the States\u2019 traditional authority to exercise their police power, provided the state action does not contravene the provisions of the Act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 677, 119 S.E.2d at 310. We said that for the Act to preempt state action \u201can intention of Congress to exclude the States from exerting their police power must be clearly manifested.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 677, 119 S.E.2d at 311, citing <em>Maurer </em>v. <em>Hamilton, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>309 U.S. 598 (1940), and <em>Napier </em>v. <em>Atlantic Coast Line R.R., </em>272 U.S. 605 (1926). We then decided that Congress had not manifested such an intention, and that the City of Norfolk could exercise its police power by enacting an otherwise valid zoning ordinance requiring a use permit for the Maritime Union\u2019s hiring hall.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">In <em>City of Richmond </em>v. <em>Southern </em>Railway, 203 Va. 220, 123 S.E.2d 641 (1962), it was argued that the State Corporation Commission had jurisdiction to determine the validity of a municipality\u2019s zoning regulations. Southern Railway was prevented from using certain lands it owned due to a Richmond City Zoning Ordinance. Southern contended that the Commission could decide the validity of the zoning ordinance because it was charged with the duty of supervising, regulating, and controlling the state\u2019s transportation companies in matters relating to the performance of their public duties. We disagreed, saying, \u201cthe vesting in the Commission of control over public utilities does not, without more, take from the local governments the powers conferred upon them by zoning statutes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 225, 123 S.E.2d at 645, citing <em>Wolf </em>v. <em>Village of Mt. Prospect, </em>314 Ill. App. 23, 40 N.E.2d 778 (1942).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">If this court adopted Tiny House\u2019s argument, we would be granting the ABC Commission the exclusive right to determine the location of establishments selling alcoholic beverages. Counsel for Tiny House conceded that if the ABC Act preempts local zoning ordinances regarding the location and concentration of this type establishment, then the ABC Commission could grant a license for such an establishment in a residential area and the local government would be powerless to prevent it.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">We find no manifest intention on the part of the legislature to grant such sweeping and unbridled authority to the ABC Commission. There is no language in the ABC Act which takes from local governments the powers conferred upon them by zoning statutes to regulate land use. The General Assembly intended to grant the ABC Commission exclusive authority to control the \u201cmanufacture, bottling, possession, sale, distribution, handling, transportation, drinking, use, advertising or dispensing of alcoholic beverages in Virginia.\u201d Code \u00a7 4-96. It did not intend to usurp the police power of local governments or to prevent them from achieving the orderly use of land through zoning ordinances. When there is no conflict between the terms of the ABC Act and those of a municipal ordinance, the ordinance may stand. <em>Repass </em>v. <em>Town of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number><em>Richlands, </em>163 Va. 1112, 178 S.E. 3 (1935). We hold that the ABC Commission\u2019s exclusive authority to license and regulate the sale and purchase of alcohlic beverages in Virginia does not preclude a municipality from utilizing valid zoning ordinances to regulate the location of an establishment selling such alcoholic beverages.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">The instant case is unlike <em>Loudoun County </em>v. <em>Pumphrey, </em>221 Va. 205, 269 S.E.2d 361 (1980), where the County Board of Supervisors adopted an ordinance requiring a minimum cash refund value of five cents on every nonrefillable beverage container. The ordinance provided that \u201cbeverage\u201d included \u201cbeer and other malt beverages\u201d as well as soft drinks. Beverage containers sold in Loudoun County were required to bear a label indicating that it was to be sold in the county and that the container could be returned for a refund. Because the ordinance regulated the bottling of alcoholic beverages contrary to Code \u00a7 4-96, and also required a deposit on bottles exempted under Regulation 32(d) of the ABC Commission, we held it invalid as inconsistent with state law. In <em>Loudoun County </em>there was a direct conflict between the local ordinance and state law. There is no such conflict in the instant case. The legislature has not granted localities the power to impose and collect deposits on beverage containers. Local governments have been granted the authority to adopt and enforce zoning ordinances to ensure the orderly use of land.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">The ABC Commission is just what its name implies. It is a commission created by the General Assembly to \u201ccontrol\u201d the merchandising of alcoholic beverages in this state. Code \u00a7 4-31 gives the ABC Commission the right to refuse to grant an ABC license if it has reasonable cause to believe that the granting of another license will be detrimental to the interest, morals, safety, or welfare of the public. In reaching this conclusion, the Commission is authorized to consider the character of, the population of, the number of similar licenses, and the total number of licenses in the particular locality or neighborhood. The Commission is to be concerned about the effect which a new license may have on real estate values and on the quietude and tranquility in the area where the business is to be located. However, the fact that the Commission, in granting a new license, may consider certain factors and their impact on the surrounding district, does not prevent a local legislative body from considering the same and additional factors in deciding whether to grant a use permit. The members of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>a local legislative body are in the most advantageous position to determine the proper uses of land within their jurisdiction. Paraphrasing Mr. Justice Powell\u2019s statement in his concurring opinion in <em>Young, </em>427 U.S. at 73, we \u201cview the case as presenting an example of innovative land-use regulation\u201d affecting the merchandising of alcoholic beverages \u201conly incidentally and to a limited extent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">Norfolk seeks to protect an established residential community by preventing the clustering of adult uses nearby. The Ordinance under question is not a prohibition measure. It is not designed to prevent or control the use of alcohol or to regulate the business of those who dispense it. That is the exclusive province of the ABC Commission. The Ordinance seeks only to prevent the use of land in a manner the City has deemed detrimental to the general welfare of its inhabitants and deemed as having a deleterious effect on the community. The General Assembly has vested the authority in the City\u2019s legislative body to take this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">In <em>Loudoun County, </em>221 Va. at 207, 269 S.E.2d at 362, we said: \u201cIf both the statute and ordinance can stand together, courts are obliged to harmonize them, rather than nullifying the ordinance.\u201d We find no conflict between any provision in the Acts of the General Assembly regulating alcoholic beverages and the Ordinance of the City of Norfolk enacted pursuant to Acts of the General Assembly concerning municipal zoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">We have considered and find no merit in appellees\u2019 assignments of cross-error.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">For the reasons set forth, the judgment of the court below is reversed, and final judgment will be entered here on behalf of the City of Norfolk.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\"><em>Reversed and final </em>judgment.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b461-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">AN ORDINANCE TO AMEND THE ZONING ORDINANCE OF THE CITY OF NORFOLK, 1968, AS AMENDED, SO AS TO ADD NEW USES KNOWN AS ADULT BOOK STORE, ADULT MOTION PICTURE THEATER, ADULT MINI MOTION PICTURE THEATER, MASSAGE PARLOR-HEALTH PARLOR, AND ESTABLISHMENT FOR THE SALE OF BEER, WINE AND/ OR MIXED BEVERAGES FOR ON-PREMISES CONSUMPTION, TO DEFINE SUCH USES AND TO PROVIDE REGULATIONS SO AS TO PERMIT SUCH USES ONLY BY USE PERMIT IN CERTAIN ZONING DISTRICTS, TO PROHIBIT SUCH USES IN OTHER DISTRICTS, TO REQUIRE THAT ANY USE HAVING AN ON-PREMISE LICENSE FROM THE VIRGINIA ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGE CONTROL COMMISSION SHALL BE PERMISSIBLE ONLY BY USE PERMITS AND TO PROVIDE FOR CITY COUNCIL TO GRANT WAIVERS UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">BE IT ORDAINED by the Council of the City of Norfolk:</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">Section 1:- That the Zoning Ordinance of the City of Norfolk, 1968, as amended, is hereby amended by adding five new sections thereto defining adult uses which sections are numbered and read as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">***</p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">1102.1.5.

Special regulations of these areas is necessary to insure that these adverse effects will not contribute to the blighting or downgrading of the surrounding neighborhood. These special regulations are itemized in this section. The primary control or regulation is for the purpose of preventing the concentration or location of these uses in a manner that would create such adverse effects.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">Uses subject to these controls are as follows</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">1.
