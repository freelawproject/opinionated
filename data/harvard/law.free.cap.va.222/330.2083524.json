Lakeland subsequently defaulted on its construction loan, and Standard Federal Savings and Loan Association (Standard Federal) became the owner of record of the real estate subject to appellants\u2019 mechanics\u2019 liens. Appellants filed bills of complaint to enforce their mechanics\u2019 liens in May and June 1977, but both failed to name Standard Federal as a party defendant. The trial court granted appellants leave to amend the bills of complaint to include Standard Federal as a defendant. Standard Federal demurred to the amended bills of complaint on the ground that suit was not brought against it within six months \u201cfrom the time when the memorandum of lien was recorded.\u201d Code \u00a7 43-17. The trial court properly sustained these demurrers. <em>See Neff </em>v. <em>Garrard, </em>216 Va. 496, 498, 219 S.E.2d 878, 879-80 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-10\">Fairfax Lumber and Millwork Company, Inc., (Fairfax Lumber) also filed a memorandum of a mechanics\u2019 lien in January 1977. It filed a bill of complaint to enforce the lien in June 1977. Named as defendants in the suit were Lakeland, Standard Federal and fifteen other holders of mechanics\u2019 liens against the property. Appellants were included among the defendants named in this suit. The bill of complaint averred that at least thirty-five mechanics\u2019 liens had been filed against the property, and a schedule giving the specifics of the liens was attached to the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-11\">In June 1979, over two years after the filing of their memoranda of mechanics\u2019 liens, appellants sought to enforce their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>mechanics\u2019 liens by filing intervening petitions in the pending suit brought by Fairfax Lumber. Appellees<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> demurred to the petitions, contending that enforcement of appellants\u2019 mechanics\u2019 liens was barred because the intervening petitions were not filed within the limitation period set out in Code \u00a7 43-17. The' trial court sustained the demurrers and dismissed the intervening petitions. In this appeal, we determine if the trial court properly sustained the demurrers to appellants\u2019 intervening petitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">Code \u00a7 43-22<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> allows a lienor to seek enforcement of his lien in a second lienor\u2019s suit to enforce a mechanics\u2019 lien against the same property. Code \u00a7 43-17 provides that \u201c[n]o suit to enforce any lien perfected under \u00a7\u00a7 43-4, 43-5 and 43-7 to 43-10\u201d shall be brought except within a specified time period and that \u201cthe filing of a petition to enforce any such lien in any suit wherein such petition may be properly filed shall be regarded as the institution of a suit under this section.\u201d The text of these portions of Code \u00a7\u00a7 43-17 and 43-22 has remained virtually unchanged since their simultaneous enactment by the General Assembly, Acts, 1893-94, c. 535 at 576. This common history dictates that each provision be interpreted in light of the other. When read together, it is clear that these code sections require that a lienor\u2019s intervening petition in a suit to enforce a mechanics\u2019 lien be filed within the limitation period provided in Code \u00a7 43-17. Although the filing of an intervening petition in a suit filed by another lienor is the equivalent of instituting a suit under Code \u00a7 43-17, being named a party defendant in a suit by a lienor is not. It is important for the owner, the builder, and the lender to know at an early date the extent to which the property involved in encumbered. Merely naming a lienor in a suit is not enough to provide this information because it does not establish the validity of the lien or the amount due thereunder. The limitation period set out in Code \u00a7 43-17 ensures that the three principals named above will know the lienors who seek to enforce mechanics\u2019 liens recorded against the property and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>amount claimed to be due not later than \u201csix months from the time when the memorandum of lien was recorded or . . . sixty days from the time the building, structure or railroad was completed or the work thereon otherwise terminated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\">We reject the appellants\u2019 contention that <em>Spiller </em>v. <em>Wells, </em>96 Va. 598, 32 S.E. 46 (1899), is controlling and mandates reversal of the circuit court\u2019s judgment. In <em>Spiller, </em>the primary issue was a jurisdictional dispute between two courts of concurrent jurisdiction concerning suits filed in each court to enforce mechanics\u2019 liens upon the same property. Barnard &amp; Co., a subcontractor of Wells, filed suit in a circuit court to enforce the mechanics\u2019 lien against property owned by Spiller. Later, but within the statutory period, Wells filed a separate suit in a court of law and chancery to enforce his mechanics\u2019 lien against Spiller. Barnard filed a petition in Wells\u2019 suit, asking the court to dismiss or stay Wells\u2019 suit until disposition of Barnard\u2019s suit. The court of law and chancery dismissed Barnard\u2019s petition. Reversing the court of law and chancery, we held that the court first acquiring jurisdiction over the subject matter should decide all questions flowing out of the controversy. In the course of the opinion, we concluded that Barnard\u2019s suit, which named Wells as a party defendant, tolled the statute of limitations for Wells and other subcontractors claiming under him.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 602, 32 S.E. at 48. While this portion of <em>Spiller </em>might be interpeted to hold that a lienor\u2019s being named a party defendant tolls the time period within which a suit must be filed even though the lienor has not filed a petition to enforce his lien, we confine the <em>Spiller </em>holding to cases involving liens filed by a general contractor and his subcontractors. In the instant case, we are concerned only with the liens filed by general contractors.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\"><em>Richmond Eng. Corp. </em>v. <em>Loth, </em>135 Va. 110, 157-59, 115 S.E. 774, 788 (1923), and <em>Francis, et als. </em>v. <em>Hotel Rueger, </em>125 Va. 106, 99 S.E. 690 (1919), are likewise inapposite. In both cases, the lienors seeking to enforce their mechanics\u2019 liens in suits filed by other parties had neither filed intervening petitions nor become parties to the second lienor\u2019s action prior to the expiration of their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>liens. Despite certain language found in these opinions,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> we conclude that neither case stands for the proposition that a lienor, who is named as a party in a second lienor\u2019s suit to enforce a mechanics\u2019 lien, may seek to enforce his own lien in that suit if he has failed to file a petition seeking enforcement of his lien within the time period prescribed by Code \u00a7 43-17.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">For the reasons stated, we will affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b368-5\"> Commonwealth Investment Mortgage Co., James N. and Helen J.
