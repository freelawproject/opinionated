Young was driving his motorcycle on Route 650 in Fluvanna County when he was struck by what the record describes as a \u201ctrail bike,\u201d or a \u201cYamaha motorcycle,\u201d operated by Gary Thomas, the 16-year-old son of Willis L. Thomas, Sr. At that time, Young was insured by a policy containing uninsured motorist coverage issued by appellant Central Na<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>tional Insurance Company of Omaha. Willis L. Thomas, Sr., was the named insured in a family automobile insurance policy and in a farmers comprehensive personal liability insurance policy, both issued by appellee Virginia Farm Bureau Mutual Insurance Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">Virginia Farm Bureau denied that either policy provided liability coverage for the collision. In October of 1978, Central National settled Young\u2019s claim under the uninsured motorist provision for $4,000 and was subrogated for Young up to that amount. Iii June of 1979, in a negligence action brought against Gary Thomas and his father, Young was awarded damages in the amount of $2,000 against Gary Thomas. In July of 1979, Central National, contending that Virginia Farm Bureau\u2019s policies issued to Gary Thomas\u2019 father provided liability coverage, filed this action against Virginia Farm Bureau. Although unclear from the record on appeal, the case was apparently submitted to the trial court on the basis only of the parties\u2019 responses to requests for 19 admissions. Each party moved for summary judgment, Central National specifically asserting there were \u201cno material facts in dispute\u201d and that \u201cthe matter is ripe for summary judgment.\u201d In February of 1980, the trial court, apparently rejecting Central National\u2019s claim that Virginia Farm Bureau\u2019s insurance policies provided coverage, granted Virginia Farm Bureau\u2019s motion for summary judgment without assigning any reasons for the decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">On appeal, Central National, not raising any issue concerning the automobile insurance policy, contends that the trial court erred in concluding, as a matter of law, that the farmers comprehensive personal liability policy did not provide coverage. In addition, Central National now contends summary judgment should not have been entered because there was not sufficient evidence to support it in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">The farmers comprehensive personal liability policy issued to Willis L. Thomas, Sr., obligated Virginia Farm Bureau to \u201cpay on behalf of the Insured all sums, which the Insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages because of bodily injury or property damage.\u201d Coverage, however, did not extend \u201cto the ownership, maintenance, operation, use, loading or unloading of . . . automobiles or midget automobiles while away from the premises or the ways immediately adjoining.\u201d Even though Central National admitted that the accident occurred \u201caway from the premises or the ways immediately adjoining,\u201d the coverage issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>turns upon whether the \u201ctrail bike\u201d operated by Gary Thomas was either an \u201cautomobile\u201d or a \u201cmidget automobile.\u201d If it falls within either of these categories, the trial court correctly granted summary judgment for Virginia Farm Bureau because coverage for the apparatus in question was thus excluded by the terms of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">The record is utterly insufficient to decide the question presented because it lacks a detailed description of the thing called a \u201ctrail bike.\u201d What is its size and configuration? How many wheels does it have? What is the source of power and what is the motor\u2019s horsepower, if it has a motor? Does it have a clutch, a brake or a hand throttle? Is it equipped with turn indicators, headlights or taillights? What is its seating capacity? These are just some of the relevant facts not found in the record. And we may not properly take judicial notice of the characteristics of either a \u201ctrail bike\u201d or a \u201cYamaha motorcycle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">We must not only decide the basic question whether the \u201ctrail bike\u201d is an \u201cautomobile\u201d or a \u201cmidget automobile\u201d but we may also have to decide whether it is \u201cequipment\u201d that is \u201cdesigned for use principally off public roads\u201d and whether it is \u201csubject to motor vehicle registration,\u201d within the contemplation of the policy. No meaningful legal conclusion on those issues can be reached, given the sparse record before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">What, then, is the disposition to be made of the case at this appellate stage of the proceeding? By moving for summary judgment under Rule 3:18, both parties represented to the trial court there was no material fact genuinely in dispute. But merely because both litigants believed the evidence was sufficiently complete to decide the case does not relieve the trial judge of the responsibility and duty to make an independent evaluation of the record on that issue. A court\u2019s duty to ascertain whether facts remain in dispute or whether there are sufficient facts to decide the question presented is not obviated by cross motions for summary judgment. <em>Eby </em>v. <em>Reb Realty, Inc., </em>495 F.2d 646, 649 n.4 (9th Cir. 1974). <em>See American Fidelity &amp; Casualty Co., Inc. </em>v. <em>London &amp; Edinburgh Ins. Co., </em>354 F.2d 214, 216 (4th Cir. 1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">Here, the trial court should have denied the respective motions and required the evidence to be developed fully. Consequently, we will reverse the judgment appealed from and remand the case for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
