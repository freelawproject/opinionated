BURK v. J. L. PORTER, III [,] HAROLD MITCHELL [,] DANNY BROWN, Members of the Board of Supervisors of Russell County, Virginia\u201d. The bill prayed for an accounting and a decree \u201cordering the Defendants to reimburse the taxpayers of Russell County for . . . illegal expenditures\u201d of public funds. Burk alleged that he was a resident and taxpayer of Russell County; that the defendants withdrew <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>County funds for the purpose of paying their expenses for \u201ca trip from Lebanon, Virginia to San Francisco, California\u201d; and that the withdrawal and expenditures were \u201cunauthorized and . . . not within the scope of the Defendants\u2019 duties as members of the Board of Supervisors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">Although not named a defendant, Dr. Roy Smith, the fourth member of the Board, joined Porter, Mitchell, and Brown in a demurrer. Demurrants alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>that the bill \u201csues members of the Board of Supervisors in their official capacity and not as individuals\u201d and that the bill was insufficient because Burk had not complied with the procedural requirements of Code \u00a7\u00a7 15.1-550, -554. The chancellor sustained the demurrer on those grounds, and, as stated by both parties, the questions on appeal derive solely from the ruling on those grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\"> Code \u00a7\u00a7 15.1-550 <em>et seq. </em>provide the exclusive procedure for litigating claims against a county. <em>Chesterfield </em>v. <em>Town &amp; Country Apts., </em>214 Va. 587, 203 S.E.2d 117 (1974). Failure to allege compliance with these statutes is fatal to an action against a county. <em>Id. </em>at 591, 203 S.E.2d at 120. The bill of complaint contained no such allegations, and if the bill sounded against the County, the demurrer was well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-7\">Necessarily underlying the chancellor\u2019s ruling is his conclusion that the County was the defendant. Assigning error to the ruling, Burk contends that his action lay against Porter, Mitchell, and Brown as individuals. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-8\">Inclusion of the phrase, \u201cMembers of the Board of Supervisors\u201d, in the bill\u2019s caption did not render the cause one against the County. Those words, employed parenthetically, merely served to identify and describe those named as defendants; the capacity in which named defendants are sued must be determined from the allegations of the bill. <em>Hanson </em>v. <em>Blake, Adm\u2019r., </em>63 W.Va. 560, 562, 60 S.E. 589, 590 (1908). Burk asserted no claim against the County. Rather, he alleged that three of the four members of the governing body were indebted to the County, requested an accounting, and prayed for a decree ordering the defendants as individuals to pay the debt. Consequently, the provisions of Code \u00a7 15.1-554 requiring a person asserting a claim against a county to present his claim to the board of supervisors before beginning action against the county is inapplicable. The same is true of \u00a7 15.1-508 concerning service of process upon the attorney for the Commonwealth or the county attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>Under Code \u00a7 15.1-550, when the attorney for the Commonwealth or the county attorney or \u201cany six freeholders of the county\u201d consider a claim allowed by the board to be illegal, the attorney is required to initiate and pursue a process of administrative review and judicial appeal. Defendants contend that this statutory procedure is the exclusive remedy in such cases and that Burk\u2019s bill is defective because he did not pursue it.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-5\">It has long been a well-established doctrine that'courts of equity have jurisdiction to restrain the illegal diversion of public funds at the suit of a citizen and tax payer, when brought on behalf of himself and others similarly situated; and to compel the restitution of public funds which have been illegally diverted and lodged in the hands of persons not entitled to the same, who have taken them with notice of wrongful diversion, and the governing body of the subordinate or local government will not act or take the necessary steps to have such funds restored.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b834-6\"><em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Black, </em>103 Va. 477, 484, 49 S.E. 633, 635 (1905).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-7\">In <em>Johnson, </em>as here, taxpayers sought to compel restitution to the county treasury of public funds illegally diverted to individual members of the board of supervisors. Appealing a judgment for the taxpayers, the defendants argued that the bill in equity did not lie because \u00a7 836 of the Code of 1904, the statutory ancestor of Code \u00a7 15.1-550, afforded the taxpayers an adequate remedy at law. Rejecting that argument, this Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-8\">Courts of equity having once acquired jurisdiction never lose it because jurisdiction of the same matter is given to courts of law, unless the statute conferring such jurisdiction uses restrictive or prohibitory words.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b834-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 485, 49 S.E. at 635. Finding no such words, we affirmed the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-10\">Defendants ignore this language. They contend that the <em>Johnson </em>decision rested upon a finding that the statute did not afford a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>remedy at law. They point to the following excerpt from the opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b835-5\">[W]e conclude what we have to say on this subject with the remark that whatever remedy section 836 may afford as against a claim allowed by the Board of Supervisors before the same has been paid, it certainly furnishes no remedy for the recovery of moneys illegally diverted from and already paid out of the public treasury which is the object of the present suit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b835-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 487, 49 S.E. at 636.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-7\"><em>Johnson </em>does not control this case, defendants argue, because the statute construed there has been amended to authorize the attorney for the Commonwealth or the county attorney to \u201cinstitute proper proceedings in the circuit court\u201d when an illegal claim against a county has been allowed by the board of supervisors and \u201chas already been paid.\u201d <em>See </em>Revisor\u2019s Note to \u00a7 2759, Code of 1919, Annotated. This amendment, defendants say, fills \u201cthe void that this Court noted in <em>[Johnson]\", </em>and since the statute now affords an adequate remedy at law, Burk\u2019s bill in equity is demurrable.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-8\">We disagree. The language in <em>Johnson </em>which defendants ignore was the <em>ratione decidendi, see Chesterfield </em>v. <em>Town &amp; Country Apts., </em>214 Va. at 591, 203 S.E.2d at 120; the excerpt they cite expressly identified itself as a mere \u201cremark\u201d. Applying the <em>Johnson </em>rule and finding no \u201crestrictive or prohibitory words\u201d in the amendment enacted by the General Assembly after our decision in that case, we hold that the chancellor had jurisdiction to entertain Burk\u2019s bill of complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-9\">We will reverse the order sustaining defendants\u2019 demurrer and remand the cause with instructions to restore the bill to the docket for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-10\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b834-11\"> A demand upon the local government is not a condition precedent when \u201cthe complaint shows the existence of conditions rendering such demand and refusal unnecessary.\u201d <em>Sauer </em>v. <em>Monroe, </em>171 Va. 421, 424, 199 S.E. 487, 488 (1938) (quoting from McQuillin, Municipal Corporations (2d Ed.), section 2766).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
