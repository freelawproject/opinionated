Harter, started work as a deputy sheriff for the City of Waynesboro in September, 1976. The City, at that time, did not require a physical examination as a precondition of employment, and no examination of Harter was conducted by the City.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b601-12\">On February 1, 1979, while on duty, Harter suffered a heart attack. He returned to part-time employment in April of 1979 and to full-time work in May of the same year. Harter filed a claim for workmen\u2019s compensation, alleging his heart attack was an occupational disease and relying on the presumption provided by \u00a7 65.1-47.1 to prove his case. The hearing commissioner, on March <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>14, 1980, ruled Harter was entitled to benefits and the decision was affirmed by the full Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">The City contended below and argues here that Harter was not entitled to the benefit of the statutory presumption and did not otherwise prove his heart condition was work-related. It points to the part of \u00a7 65.1-47.1 which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-5\">provided that prior to making any claim based upon such presumption, . . . such deputy sheriff, . . . shall have been found free from . . . heart disease,. . . by a physical examination which shall include such appropriate laboratory and other diagnostic studies as . . . the county or city of which he is . . . deputy sheriff, shall prescribe and which shall have been conducted by physicians whose qualifications shall have been prescribed by such . . . governing body; ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">Since Harter did not have such an examination, the City argues the presumption does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">Harter contends the construction urged on us by the City would nullify the effect of \u00a7 65.1-47.1. He asserts no employer would conduct physical examinations of its employees, and no one, therefore, would get the benefits of the presumption. Harter argues that, to avoid this result, the statute must be read as creating an affirmative duty on the employer to prescribe examinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-8\">Support for Harter\u2019s position is found in the language of the statute. As quoted above, it states the employer <em>\u201cshall </em>prescribe\u201d the physical examination the employee must undergo. (Emphasis added.) The word \u201cshall\u201d is generally used in its mandatory sense. <em>Schmidt </em>v. <em>City of Richmond, </em>206 Va. 211, 218, 142 S.E.2d 573, 578 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-9\">Both parties use \u00a7\u00a7 27.40.1 and 27.40.1:1 to buttress their arguments. Section 27-40.1 makes a statutory presumption of occupational disease available to firemen who make claims under local disability programs. The language of this section mirrors and, in fact, formed the basis for \u00a7 65.1-47.1. <em>Berry </em>v. <em>County of Henrico, </em>219 Va. 259, 264, 247 S.E.2d 389, 392 (1978). Subsequent to the enactment of \u00a7 27-40.1, the General Assembly passed \u00a7 27-40.1:1 which mandates that localities provide physical examinations to new fire fighters and states fire fighters will be entitled to the presumption if the examination is not given.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>The City argues that in enacting \u00a7 27-40.1:1 the General Assembly clearly and unambiguously mandated physical examinations for fire fighters, and, if it wished to do the same with respect to \u00a7 65.1-47.1, it would have used the same language. Rebutting this, Harter correctly points out that \u00a7 27-40.1:1 refers to the examination \u201crequired by \u00a7 27-40.1.\u201d If \u00a7 27-40.1 makes an examination mandatory on the part of the City, \u00a7 65.1-47.1, which contains the same language, must contain the same mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\">Early workmen\u2019s compensation laws provided relief only to the worker injured by accident on the job. Over the years, it was learned that the dangers of the work place are not confined to accidents, and the concept of occupational disease emerged. When there is a direct causal connection between the conditions under which the work is performed and the disease, compensation may be awarded. Code \u00a7 65.1-46.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">Possibly no employees are subjected to more stress than fire fighters and law enforcement officers. While it is known that stress can have an adverse impact on one\u2019s health, it is difficult to conclusively link stress to heart disease in an individual case.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Recognizing this, and taking into account the important role performed by these public servants, the General Assembly, along with legislatures in many states, enacted the presumption found in \u00a7 65.1-47.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">The interpretation urged on us by the City would eviscerate \u00a7 65.1-47.1 and defeat the obvious legislative intent. Not only would it give the employer the ability to defeat the statutory presumption, but it would also discourage municipalities from giving pre-employment physical examinations. The public has an interest in seeing that fire fighters and police are physically qualified for the job.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">Therefore, we hold Code \u00a7 65.1-47.1 required the City to conduct the prescribed examination, and, when it failed to do so, Harter was entitled to the presumption that his heart attack was an occupational disease suffered in the line of duty. Since the City failed to produce evidence to rebut the presumption, we will affirm the award made to Harter by the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b604-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>\n<em>APPENDIX</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">\u00a7 65.1-47.1.
