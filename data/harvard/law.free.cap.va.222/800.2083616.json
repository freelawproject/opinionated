He fell while on a commercial aircraft at National Airport. At the time, the claimant, whose job title was \u201ccaterer,\u201d was working as a truck driver for his employer, appellant Sky Chefs, Incorporated, and placing containers of food weighing 85 to 100 pounds aboard the plane to provide \u201cfresh\u201d meals for passengers. The employer\u2019s insurer, appellant Travelers Indemnity Company, initially accepted the claim as compensable. Rogers was paid compensation for total work incapacity and necessary medical care beginning May 9, 1978, through December 20, 1979.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-12\">On the latter date, the employer and insurer (hereinafter collectively referred to as \u201cemployer\u201d) filed in the Industrial Commission a Notice of Application For Hearing alleging a change of condition. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 65.1-99. According to the application, Rogers was able to return to his regular employment on November 27, 1979.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-13\">A hearing on the application was held at Fairfax in March of 1980 before a deputy commissioner, who found, in a May 1980 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>opinion, that the employer had failed to carry its burden of proof. The full Commission, upon review, affirmed the deputy\u2019s decision in July of 1980 and denied the employer\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">On appeal, the employer contends the evidence was uncontradicted that the claimant was able to return to his regular duties on November 27, 1979, and asserts the Commission erred in holding to the contrary. An essential part of the employer\u2019s argument is the claim that the Commission erred in considering records dealing with Rogers\u2019 medical condition subsequent to January 19, 1980, the date claimant again fell after he had resumed his regular employment two weeks earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-6\">In the May 1978 fall, the claimant received a head injury, diagnosed as \u201ca mild concussion,\u201d and injury of \u201csome degree\u201d to his entire left side. Following a brief period of hospitalization, claimant was examined numerous times during the next 22 months in Northern Virginia and in the District of Columbia by various physicians and at a number of hospitals.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-7\">Within a week of the accident one neurosurgeon reported Rogers had \u201cfully recovered\u201d from the concussion and \u201cwas neurologically normal.\u201d Nevertheless, over the ensuing months, the claimant continued to complain of intermittent pain, numbness, and weakness in the whole left side of his body. He was unable to lift heavy objects. He also experienced dizzy spells, headaches, and \u201coccasional attacks\u201d when he could not walk.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-8\">The physicians were unable to make any objective physical findings to explain claimant\u2019s subjective complaints. Within three months of the accident, the attending physician reported Rogers\u2019 condition was \u201cfunctional in nature.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b838-9\">During the 22-month period, Rogers was treated with various medications and by physical therapy. At times, claimant was advised either that he could return to light work or that he could resume the full duties of his pre-injury occupation. Yet the symptoms persisted and Rogers did not resume his regular duties with the employer until January of 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-10\">In support of its application, the employer relied on the opinion of claimant\u2019s attending physician, a neurosurgeon, who reported on December 10, 1979, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b838-11\">\u201cI found [upon an examination on November 27, 1979] no objective medical evidence of disease or injury to the spine or the peripheral nerves. I found no objective medical evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>of any neuromuscular condition which would prevent him from returning to his regular duties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-5\">\u201cI talked to the patient about going back to work at his regular job. He states that he feels he cannot take the risks involved and must look after himself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-6\">\u201cMr. Rogers requires no further neurosurgical care at this time.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b839-7\">After the application was filed on December 20 and before the March 1980 hearing, the claimant returned to work for the employer on January 4 and performed his regular duties until January 19. Rogers testified that during the 15-day period he was \u201churting\u201d and \u201caching quite a bit\u201d on his left side but he continued working. Then, on January 19, Rogers was walking to a plane lifting a food container when he \u201cjust went numb and fell.\u201d Subsequently, he was hospitalized for about a week. His condition was diagnosed as \u201c [functional anesthesia left lower extremity,\u201d according to a physician\u2019s report dated January 21, 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-8\">The claimant was examined in February of 1980 by the physician who attended him for the May 1978 episode. The doctor reported on February 22 that since the 1978 accident Rogers \u201chas had periods or spells where the feeling would leave his left side.\u201d The physician concluded the report as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-9\">\u201cMy impression is that we are most probably dealing with a form of conversion reaction which may be related to anxiety and depression. I frankly doubt that there is an organic neurological basis for this complaint, especially a complaint of numbness which comes and goes with such frequency.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-10\">\u201cI recommended, however, that the patient have a CT scan performed to give us further evaluation of the anatomical situation of the brain. In addition, I felt that a psychological evaluation was definitely a proper approach. The patient might well benefit from anti-depressant medication.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-11\">\u201cI do not have any further information to add from the neurosurgical or neurological standpoint.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b839-12\">That report was filed with the Commission 15 days before the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-13\">At the beginning of the hearing, counsel for the claimant, referring to the January 19 incident, said that \u201cit\u2019s either a new accident or it flows out of the original [1978] industrial accident.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>Counsel for the employer and insurer took the position that the \u201ccarrier is not prepared at this time to go forward based upon a claim of a new accident.\u201d Accordingly, the deputy commissioner stated that the hearing would be confined to consideration of the question whether there had been a change in Rogers\u2019 condition and would not encompass any claim of a new accident on January 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">In his opinion denying the employer\u2019s application, the hearing commissioner stated he was not \u201cpersuaded that the claimant was able to return to his regular work loading and unloading heavy food carriers from airplanes on November 27, 1979.\u201d Noting the claimant \u201cdid subsequently attempt work for a short period of time in January,\u201d the commissioner found that Rogers\u2019 \u201cfunctional inability to continue to perform his food handling duties (associated with his persistent symptoms of periodic numbness, pain and swelling) casts doubt upon\u201d the employer\u2019s assertion that the claimant was able to return to his former employment on the date in question. The commissioner further stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b840-5\">\u201cAlthough it appears that the claimant\u2019s symptoms are in all likelihood associated with a hysterical conversion reaction, the claim was initially accepted as compensable by the [employer] and the evidence does not now establish that this condition did not arise from the industrial accident. The record does not contain the opinion of a psychologist on this issue. The Industrial Commission cannot substitute its opinion for that of a competent psychologist or psychiatrist, and in the absence of persuasive evidence we cannot find that the claimant\u2019s condition has improved to the point that he is fully capable of performing the duties of his pre-injury employment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">Upon review, the full Commission adopted those findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-7\">In arguing on appeal that the evidence was sufficient to sustain its burden of proving change of condition, the employer points to pre-1980 medical reports stating that Rogers was capable of returning to his regular employment. Also, the employer says \u201c[t]here can be no question of the claimant\u2019s ability to return to work in light of his testimony that he did in fact return to work on January 4, 1980.\u201d In addition, the employer argues that \u201c[e]ven though the Deputy Commissioner specifically ruled that no claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>by Mr. Rogers for disability resulting from the January 19, 1980 injury would be heard, he based his Opinion upon medical reports which specifically related to Mr. Rogers\u2019 medical condition after and as a result of the January 19, 1980 \u2018injury\u2019.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">As we have repeatedly noted, the Commission\u2019s findings of fact when based upon credible evidence are conclusive and binding upon us. Code \u00a7 65.1-98; <em>Fairfax Hospital </em>v. <em>DeLaFleur, </em>221 Va. 406, 410, 270 S.E.2d 720, 722 (1980). The question presented here is whether there is credible evidence in the record to support the Commission\u2019s finding that the employer failed to establish by a preponderance of the evidence its allegation that Rogers, on November 27, 1979, was able fully to perform the duties of his preinjury employment. \"See <em>Virginia Oak Flooring Co. </em>v. <em>Chrisley, </em>195 Va. 850, 852, 80 S.E.2d 537, 538 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">First, we address, and reject, the employer\u2019s contention that post-January 19, 1980 medical evidence should have been disregarded by the Commission. The 1980 medical reports to which we have referred had been filed prior to the hearing and the employer knew or should have known of their contents. Those reports, contrary to the employer\u2019s argument, merely demonstrated a continuation of the claimant\u2019s functional disability that earlier had been noted within three months of the May 1978 accident; they did not relate only to a new condition that became manifest for the first time after the January 19, 1980 episode, as the employer contends.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-7\">Second, we hold the record supports the Commission\u2019s rejection of the employer\u2019s application. The January 1980 episode occurred without direct external stimulus; it was spontaneous, happening when the claimant \u201cjust went numb and fell.\u201d Manifestly, the Commission concluded that the 1980 incident was merely indicative of Rogers\u2019 physical condition and functional disability as it had existed from shortly after the May 1978 accident, through November of 1979, and including the first three months of 1980. Indeed, the hearing commissioner pointed out that the claimant\u2019s \u201cfunctional inability\u201d to continue to perform his regular duties during January of 1980 \u201ccasts doubt\u201d upon the employer\u2019s allegation that Rogers was able to return to his former employment on November 27, 1979. <em>Compare Burlington Mills Corp. </em>v. <em>Hagood, 177 </em>Va. 204, 13 S.E.2d 291 (1941), <em>and Womack, Inc. </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>209 Va. 588, 166 S.E.2d 265 (1969), <em>with </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number><em>Keller Manufacturing Co. </em>v. <em>Hoke, </em>215 Va. 525, 211 S.E.2d 82 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the award appealed from will be</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
