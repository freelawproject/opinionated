Blue, Jr., a licensed attorney, in the Circuit Court of Hanover County. After issuing a rule as required by Code \u00a7 54-74, the Honorable Richard H. C. Taylor wrote a letter to Chief Justice Lawrence W. I\u2019Anson in which he requested that none of the judges of the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit be required to sit and hear the charges against Blue. Pursuant to Code \u00a7 17-7(2)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Chief Justice I\u2019Anson appointed three judges, none of whom was from the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit and one of whom was retired. In addition, the circuit court, acting upon the request of the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney for Hanover County and pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-155,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> appointed a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>substitute to prosecute the charges. In December of 1979, the three-judge panel determined Blue was guilty of professional misconduct. After judgment had been entered, Blue moved to set aside the judgment on the grounds that Code \u00a7 54-74(2)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> required that the judge issuing the rule be one of the three judges hearing the case and that this Code section precluded the designation of a retired judge. In addition, he contended that Code \u00a7 54-74(3)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> prohibited the appointment of a substitute for the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney for Hanover County. The circuit court denied his motion, and Blue then filed this appeal of right in which he limits himself to the jurisdictional issues raised before the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">We do not agree with Blue\u2019s arguments. A statute should be construed, where possible, with a view toward harmonizing it with other statutes. <em>Albemarle County </em>v. <em>Marshall, Clerk, </em>215 Va. 756, 761, 214 S.E.2d 146, 150 (1975). Here, Code \u00a7 17-7(2) expressly authorizes the Chief Justice to designate \u201ca judge of some other court of record or a retired judge of any such court\u201d to hear a case when a judge has disqualified himself in \u201cany case.\u201d Likewise, Code \u00a7 19.2-155 authorizes the appointment of a substitute for the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney when the Commonwealth\u2019s At<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>torney has disqualified himself. We refuse to adopt a construction of former Code \u00a7 54-74(2) and (3) that would require judges or Commonwealth\u2019s Attorneys to participate in proceedings when they believe such participation would be improper and they have followed the procedures outlined in Code \u00a7\u00a7 17-7 and 19.2-155.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">For the reasons stated, we will affirm the judgment of the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b394-11\"> Code \u00a7 17-7(2) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-12\">If all the judges of any court of record are so situated in respect to any case, civil or criminal, pending in their court as to render it improper, in their opinion, for them to preside at the trial, unless the cause or proceeding is removed, as provided by law, they shall enter the fact of record and the clerk of the court shall at once certify the same to the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, who shall designate a judge of some other court of record or a retired judge of any such court to preside at the trial of such case.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b394-13\"> Code \u00a7 19.2-155 provides insofar as here pertinent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-14\">If the attorney for the Commonwealth of any county or city ... is so situated with respect to such accused as to render it improper, in his opinion, concurred in by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>judge, for him to act. . . then upon notification by such attorney for the Commonwealth . . . which fact shall be entered of record, the judge of the circuit court shall appoint an attorney-at-law for such case ... as may be necessary or desirable, and the same to be forthwith entered of record.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b395-6\"> At the time this case was heard by the three-judge panel, Code \u00a7 54-74(2) provided in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-7\">At the time such rule is issued the court issuing the same shall certify the fact of such issuance and the time and place of the hearing thereon, to the chief justice of the Supreme Court of Virginia, who shall designate two judges, other than the judge of the court issuing the rule, of circuit courts or courts of record of cities of the first class to hear and decide the case in conjunction with the judge issuing the rule</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">In the 1980 General Assembly session, this subsection was substantially altered. The present statutory language provides that the Chief Justice \u201cshall designate three judges of circuit courts of any circuit other than the circuit in which the case is pending to hear and decide the case.\u201d Acts 1980, ch. 289.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b395-9\"> At the time this case was heard by the three-judge panel, Code \u00a7 54-74(3) provided: It shall be the duty of the attorney for the Commonwealth for the county or city in which such case is pending to appear at the hearing and prosecute the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-10\">In the 1980 General Assembly session, this subsection was amended to read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-11\">It shall be the duty of the three-judge court to select an attorney for the Commonwealth from any county or city other than the county or city in which such case is pending to appear at the hearing and prosecute the case.
