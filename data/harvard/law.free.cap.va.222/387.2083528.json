On appeal, Best challenges his conviction upon the ground that the evidence was insufficient to establish he was in exclusive possession of recently stolen property.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-13\">Between Friday, February 15, and Monday, February 18, 1980, someone entered the lot of Craddock Auto Service in Portsmouth and stole the tires and rims to a 1971 Chevrolet which was being repaired and repainted there. Under the pretense of being interested in purchasing a car, Cecil Proffitt, the owner of Craddock Auto Service, and Wayne Thompson, a part-time employee, went to a neighborhood where two cars were for sale. Best and two others showed them both cars. When they examined the second car, which was at Best\u2019s home, Proffitt asked Best if he had tires <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>to replace the worn tires on the car being sold. Best led them to a shed where he said he had one tire for the car. Looking into the doorless, open shed, Proffitt saw the stolen tires and wheels, which were readily identifiable because they bore paint spots matching the new color of the Chevrolet. When Proffitt asked Best about the tires, Best told him \u201cthey belonged on his sister\u2019s car. He said they didn\u2019t belong to the car he was selling.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">Best\u2019s mother testified that four persons lived at the residence where the tires were found: herself, her husband, and her two sons. She also stated that she did not know anything about the stolen tires in the shed and that her daughter lived on the Eastern Shore.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">The trial court ruled that Best was in exclusive possession of recently stolen property and thus was presumed to have stolen the items. The defendant presented no evidence, and the trial court convicted Best of grand larceny.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">For the larceny presumption to arise, the Commonwealth must establish that the accused was in exclusive possession of property recently stolen. <em>Price\u2019s Case, </em>62 Va. (21 Gratt.) 846, 869 (1872). One can be in exclusive possession of an item when he jointly possesses it with another. <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>209 Va. 317, 323, 163 S.E.2d 589, 594 (1968), <em>cert. denied, </em>394 U.S. 991 (1969). The evidence must reveal, however, that the accused was consciously asserting at least a possessory interest in the stolen property or was exercising dominion over the stolen property. <em>Drinkard </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>163 Va. 1074, 1081-82, 178 S.E. 25, 27 (1935). We have repeatedly held that the presumption does not arise when the evidence merely reveals that the stolen property was found in a place to which several people, including the accused, had access. <em>Leebrick </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>198 Va. 365, 367, 94 S.E.2d 212, 214 (1956); <em>Castle </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>196 Va. 222, 227, 83 S.E.2d 360, 364 (1954); <em>Tyler\u2019s Case, </em>120 Va. 868, 871, 91 S.E. 171, 172 (1917). In the case before us, the evidence revealed that several persons other than the accused had access to the open shed where the stolen property was found.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">Arguing the conviction should be affirmed, the Commonwealth relies heavily upon Best\u2019s statement to Proffitt that the tires belonged on his sister\u2019s car. The Commonwealth contends that Best\u2019s statement was false and extremely incriminating and that consequently the presumption of larceny arises. We find the Commonwealth\u2019s argument unpersuasive. The presumption arises <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>only when the accused has been shown to be in exclusive possession of recently stolen property, regardless of how much other incriminating evidence the Commonwealth has marshalled.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We rejected an argument similar to the Commonwealth\u2019s in <em>Leebrick, supra, </em>where the evidence revealed that several persons (including the defendants) had access to the spot under a porch where stolen property was found. We refused to uphold the convictions for burglary even though one of the defendants had incriminated himself by twice escaping from police custody, <em>Sturgis </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>197 Va. 264, 268, 88 S.E.2d 919, 921 (1955), and both defendants had made statements evidencing a knowledge of where the stolen items had been found.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">Best\u2019s statement to Proffitt cannot be construed as an assertion of a possessory interest in the stolen property. In <em>Tyler\u2019s Case, supra, </em>a stolen watch charm was found in the kitchen of a house in which the accused rented a room. The Commonwealth established that one Adams who found the charm asked the accused if he (Adams) could wear it. The accused responded, \u201cAll right, I don\u2019t care if you do.\u201d The Commonwealth argued that the accused\u2019s statement proved his ownership and possession of the charm. Reversing the accused\u2019s conviction for burglary, we held that his statement was both consistent with a claim of ownership and \u201ca position of indifference to and lack of interest in the subject.\u201d 120 Va. at 873, 91 S.E. at 173. Here, Best\u2019s statement that the tires belonged on his sister\u2019s car is inconsistent with a claim of ownership and in no way indicates a claim of possessory interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">The evidence does not support the conclusion that Best was in exclusive possession of recently stolen property. Consequently, the trial court erred in applying the presumption of larceny by the accused. Because the evidence is otherwise insufficient to support <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>the conviction, the conviction is reversed and the indictment against Best is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">\n<em>Reversed and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b426-7\"> Of course, a larceny conviction would be upheld where the other evidence was independently sufficient to sustain the conviction. Here, however, the falsity of Best\u2019s statement, apart from the presumption, would not provide a sufficient evidentiary basis for sustaining the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-8\">Citing <em>Sparks </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>136 Va. 683, 116 S.E. 236 (1923), the Commonwealth argues the conviction can be upheld even if the presumption is not applicable. In <em>Sparks, </em>we upheld the conviction over the contention that others had an equal opportunity to commit the larceny after stressing that the accused at trial had claimed the stolen property as his own. <em>Id. </em>at 686, 116 S.E. at 237. <em>Sparks </em>is pertinent only in cases where the defendant has claimed at least a possessory interest in the property another claims to have been stolen.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
