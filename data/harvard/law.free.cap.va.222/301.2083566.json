Martin, Sr., operated a cafeteria in a Danville shopping center. The premises for Martin\u2019s Cafeteria were leased to Martin pursuant to a contract which obligated Martin to maintain and repair the heating, ventilating, and air conditioning equipment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> During the term of the lease, lightning struck and damaged two air conditioning compressors on the roof of the premises leased to Martin. These compressors, which, according to the record, were \u201cbuilt into the building\u201d as a part of the air conditioning system, served the premises leased to Martin, who had neither installed them nor expended money on the original installation. Martin had the compressor units repaired at his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>own expense for $2,715.76, and sought reimbursement for this expenditure from his insurer, appellant United States Fire Insurance Company. The insurer denied coverage, and Martin filed this action seeking $2,715.76 in damages. The trial court held that Martin\u2019s insurance contract provided coverage, and the insurer has appealed, challenging that ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">Martin claims coverage under several provisions of this tenant\u2019s commercial insurance contract, which negated coverage for physical damage to the building occupied by the tenant. The \u201cCommercial Package\u201d provided various coverages appropriate for a lessee of business property.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">First, Martin contends that coverage was provided by the personal property damage provision of the contract.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> But he concedes the compressors were fixtures. Thus, they were a part of the realty and were not \u201cpersonal property owned by others.\u201d In addition, because the air conditioning compressors were not \u201cmade or acquired at the expense of the insured,\u201d the \u201cBetterments\u201d provision is inapplicable. Hence, coverage was not provided under the personal property provisions of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">Second, Martin claims coverage under \u201cCoverage C \u2014 Bodily Injury and Property Damage Liability.\u201d Coverage C provides that the insurer would pay \u201call sums which the insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages because of bodily injury or property damage to which this insurance applies.\u201d Exclusion (g) clearly exempts from coverage \u201cliability assumed by the insured under any contract or agreement relating to such premises.\u201d While Martin\u2019s lease may have legally obligated him to repair the compressor units, exclusion (g) relieves the insurer of any obligation arising under the contract.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b340-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>Finally, Martin suggests that Endorsement CF21, modifying the limits of liability under \u201cCoverage C \u2014 Bodily Injury and Property Damage Liability,\u201d provides coverage.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The relevant portions of this endorsement clearly demonstrate that the clause upon which Martin relies was intended merely to set an aggregate limit of liability and was not intended to expand the number of risks covered by the policy. Subparagraph (2), moreover, concerns property damage occurring in the course of work performed by an independent contractor and expressly excludes maintenance work at the premises rented by the insured. The damage at issue in this case, of course, did not occur in the course of work performed by any independent contractor. Therefore, even if subparagraph (2) could be viewed as covering risks beyond those initially set forth in Coverage C, it would not provide a basis for concluding the insurer was liable in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">For the reasons stated, we hold the insured\u2019s loss was not covered by the policy in question. Thus, we will reverse the judgment of the court below and enter final judgment for the insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">\n<em>Reversed and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b338-13\"> Section 26 of the lease provided in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-14\">Tenant, at its sole cost and expense, shall operate, maintain and repair the heating, ventilating and air conditioning equipment including the making of all necessary replacements thereto throughout the term of this lease and any renewal thereof.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b339-7\"><em> </em>\u201cCoverage B \u2014 -Personal Property\u201d provided in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-8\">When the insurance under this policy covers personal property, such insurance shall cover only business personal property owned by the insured . . . and <em>shall also cover the insured\u2019s interest in personal property owned by others to the extent of the value of labor and materials expended thereon by the insured; </em>all while in or on the described buildings. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-9\">This coverage shall also include Tenant\u2019s Improvements and Betterments, meaning the insured\u2019s use interest in fixtures, alterations, installations or additions comprising a part of the buildings occupied but not owned by the insured <em>and made or acquired at the expense of the insured. . . . </em>[Emphasis added].</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"AP\"> Endorsement G-209 to the liability insurance provisions extended $100,000 coverage for damage to the buildings.
