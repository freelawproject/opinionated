Ritchie, Board of Public Welfare and Director of the Department of Human Services for the City of Roanoke, William L. Lukhard, Commissioner of Public Welfare, and Charles B. Walker, Comptroller of the Commonwealth, seeking reimbursement for withheld supplemental security income payments. Fink and Dooley alleged that Code \u00a7 63.1-133.1 invalidated their written authorizations for reimbursements<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After consolidating the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>cases and hearing the evidence, the lower court denied recovery to Fink and Dooley, holding that the written authorizations were invalid and contrary to Code \u00a7 63.1-133.1, but because both had accepted the benefits of the Supplemental Security Income Program (SSI), they could not avoid the burdens (recoupment provisions) of the system. Fink and Dooley appealed, and the defendants assigned cross-error. We disagree with the lower court\u2019s rationale, but affirm its action denying Fink and Dooley relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">The SSI Program, Title XVI of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1381 <em>et seq. </em>(1976), provides assistance to the aged, blind and disabled. The delay between application for and final approval of SSI benefits can exceed six months. SSI applicants by definition cannot support themselves during the interim. Section 1383(g) permits the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (formerly Health, Education and Welfare) (hereinafter Secretary) to negotiate with state welfare departments to provide interim assistance from state or local funds to meet the applicant\u2019s basic subsistence needs until the first SSI payment arrives. The first SSI check is a lump-sum payment covering the period from application. To prevent an applicant from receiving both state and federal funds for this interim period, the Secretary, upon the applicant\u2019s written authorization, may send the first SSI check to the state or local welfare department. The state deducts the amounts that it has paid as interim assistance and sends the bal\u00e1nce, if any, to the applicant.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">The legislative history of \u00a7 1383(g)(1) indicates Congress\u2019 intent to provide recoupment of interim state funds and thus encourage the states to provide assistance when they have no duty to do so.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Pursuant to the federal statute, the Secretary and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>Commissioner of Public Welfare for Virginia entered into an agreement dated March 7, 1975, implementing the recoupment provisions of \u00a7 1383(g). The Commissioner promulgated \u201cPolicy Issuance #17\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which contained this provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b870-5\">When a client applies for assistance until receipt of SSI benefits, a GR application, PA-4, is to be completed. The worker must verify either verbally or in writing with the Social Security Administration District Office the date on which an SSI application was filed. This information must be recorded in the case record .... The worker must explain \u201cAuthorization for Release of SSI Check,\u201d Form DW-FS-38, to the applicant and have him sign this authorization for the local department to receive the first SSI check . ... <em>If applicant refuses to sign the authorization, assistance is to be denied. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b871-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>Both Fink and Dooley filed SSI applications before this 1975 agreement was executed or Policy #17 promulgated. In 1975, before any eligibility determination, they both signed authorizations directing the Secretary to send their first SSI check to the local Director of Human Services. The Secretary found them eligible and mailed their first SSI checks to the Roanoke City Department of Human Services. The Department deducted the interim assistance payments made to each and remitted the balances. Fink and Dooley sought reimbursement for the amounts deducted. When the State Commissioner and the State Comptroller refused refunds, Fink and Dooley filed suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-5\">They argued, and the lower court held, that the 1977 amendment to Code \u00a7 63.1-133.1 does not apply. The court relied on Code \u00a7 1-16 which provides the rule of construction that new statutes are prospective and not restrospective. It states that \u201c[n]o new law shall be construed to repeal a former law ... as to any act done ... or any right accrued, or claim arising under the former law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b871-6\">The trial court improperly construes Code \u00a7 63.1-133.1. The statute addresses merely the acquisition of an interest in or lien on the applicant\u2019s real or personal property as a qualifying condition for public assistance. In the early days of Virginia\u2019s welfare and public assistance programs, applicants could not meet eligibility requirements if they owned real estate. Former Code \u00a7 63.1-128 (1968 Repl. Vol. 9)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> required the local board to file a notice of assistance in the clerk\u2019s office of the county or city in which the real property was located. The clerk docketed this notice in the current judgment lien docket. Upon the recipient\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>death, the local board could satisfy the debt from the estate\u2019s assets because the filing of the notice created a lien on the estate\u2019s real and personal property. Former Code \u00a7 63.1-129 (1968 Repl. Vol. 9)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> permitted the local board to execute and record a deed of trust on the recipient\u2019s real estate to secure the assistance repayments.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-5\">In 1970, the General Assembly repealed Code \u00a7\u00a7 63.1-128 to -130, -132 and -133, and enacted Code \u00a7 63.1-133.1. Acts 1970, c. 753. This action represented a definite change of policy for the state government, and Code \u00a7 63.1-133.1, though validating past transactions, was a definite expression of that policy. In 1970, the Interim Assistance Program was not in existence. The new statute forbids the welfare department to acquire liens and \u201cother interest,\u201d such as the deed of trust, in an applicant\u2019s real and personal property, but does not prevent the Commonwealth from recouping funds paid out under the 1975 agreement with the Secretary.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-6\">As we have said, the trial court misinterprets the 1977 amendment to Code \u00a7 63.1-133.1. The applicants filed their suit in January and March of 1977. The amendment to Code \u00a7 63.1-133.1 was introduced in the Senate on January 18, 1977; was signed by the Governor on March 4, 1977; and became effective July 1, 1977. According to exhibits in this appeal, Fink and Dooley filed their claim with the Commissioner of Public Welfare on September 16, 1976, alleging that the written authorizations were invalid under Code \u00a7 63.1-133.1; on September 28, the Commissioner recommended to the Comptroller that the claims be disallowed; and on November 3, the Comptroller concurred in the recommendations of the Commissioner. The 1977 amendment states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b872-7\"><em>[T]his section shall not be construed to bar any action </em>by the State or a local board which seeks reimbursement for part or all of the costs incurred by the State or local board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>for care and maintenance provided to an applicant of the Federal Supplemental Security Income program during the application period where such applicant becomes eligible for said program retroactive to the date of application. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">Acts 1977, c. 83. This clause addresses the statute\u2019s construction, not its substance, and reveals the General Assembly\u2019s intent to use a properly worded amendment to settle the controversy. The chronology of events suggests that the 1977 amendment comes within the letter and spirit of our holding in <em>Boyd </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>216 Va. 16, 215 S.E.2d 915 (1975). There we said: \u201cWhen amendments are enacted soon after controversies arise \u2018as to the interpretation of the original act, it is logical to regard the amendment as a legislative interpretation of the original act \u2014 a formal change \u2014 rebutting the presumption of substantial change.\u2019 \u201d216 Va. at 20-21, 215 S.E.2d at 918, quoting from 1A <em>Sutherland Statutory Construction </em>\u00a7 22.31 at 184 (4th ed. C. Sands 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b873-6\">We therefore hold that Code \u00a7 63.1-133.1 does not invalidate the written authorizations of Fink and Dooley and that neither is entitled to reimbursement. The decision of the lower court will be</p>\n<p id=\"b873-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b868-12\"> Error was assigned to the action of the trial court in ruling that James D. Ritchie, Board of Public Welfare and Director of the Department of Human Services for the City of Roanoke, was not a proper party to the proceedings, but in view of our holding it is unnecessary to reach that issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b868-13\"> Code \u00a7 63.1-133.1. <em>No lien to attach to property of applicant or recipient; release of existing unforeclosed liens. </em>\u2014 No lien or other interest in favor of the State or any of its political subdivisions shall be claimed against, levied or attached to the real or personal property of any applicant for or recipient of public welfare assistance and services as a condition of eligibility therefor or to recover such aid following the death of such applicant or recipient.

The 1AR <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>program was established to alleviate hardships on potential SSI recipients resulting from delay in determination of SSI eligibility. Federal reimbursement is made only for applicants who are subsequently determined eligible for SSI payments. There is no cost to the Federal government because SSI payments are retroactive to the date of application once eligibility is determined.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b870-7\">Participation in the IAR program is an option which the states may exercise through agreement with the Department of Health, Education and Welfare \u2014 an agreement which permits reimbursement to the state or directly to a state or local agency within the state.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b870-8\">. . . The interim payments to SSI applicants are made by States basically to mitigate the impact of the waiting period for certification. The Federal government only reimburses the States for payments which were made to applicants who were eligible during the period for which they received interim payments. In the absence of this reimbursement provision, no State would have the incentive to make interim payments.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b870-9\"> \u201cPolicy Issuance #17\u201d states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b870-10\">\n<em>GENERAL RELIEF PENDING SSI DETERMINATION</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqis\">\n<em>Interim Assistance Payment Program</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b870-11\">I.

The recovery is made by implementing a system in which the client\u2019s first (retroactive) SSI check is sent directly from the Social Security Administration to the locality making the GR payments.
