To pay the premium, Mayton executed a premium finance agreement with Thico Plan, Inc. (hereafter, Thico), the terms of which required him to make monthly payments to Thico. As a part of this agreement, Mayton \u201cirrevocably appoint [ed] Thico his attorney-in-fact with authority to cancel the insurance [policy] ... for default in the payment of money due Thico . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b567-11\">After Mayton defaulted in his payment due June 6, 1977, Thico mailed the insurance company and Mayton a notice in which it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>requested the insurer to \u201ccancel the [Mayton] policy as of the effective date shown above [June 20, 1977], or as soon thereafter as statutory, regulatory and contractual restrictions permit.\u201d On June 21, 1977, American mailed a notice of cancellation, effective June 20, to Mayton. On July 14, 1977, Mayton was involved in a motor vehicle accident out of which the present controversy arose.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">American, instituting a declaratory judgment action, alleged that it was not the insurer of Mayton on the date of the accident. Rejecting American\u2019s arguments, the trial court ruled that the notice provision of Code \u00a7 38.1-381.5(e)(2)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was applicable and that, because American had not complied with that notice provision, Mayton\u2019s insurance policy had not been legally cancelled. In this appeal, American\u2019s sole contention is that it was not obligated to meet the notice requirement set forth in Code \u00a7 38.1-381.5(e)(2) because of Code \u00a7 38.1-381.5(f)(2).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AzU\">Code \u00a7 38.1-381.5(f) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-5\">(f) Nothing in this section shall apply:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-6\">(2) If the named insured has notified in writing the insurer or its agent that he wishes the policy to be cancelled or that he does not wish the policy to be renewed, or if, prior to the date of expiration, he fails to accept the offer of the insurer to renew the policy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">American contends that Thico was acting for the insured pursuant to an irrevocable power of attorney, that \u201cthe named insured\u201d through his attorney-in-fact requested cancellation, and that consequently Code \u00a7 38.1-381.5(f)(2) relieved the insurer of its obligation to comply with Code \u00a7 38.1-381.5(e)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>The issue before us is solely a question of legislative intent: When the General Assembly adopted Code \u00a7 38.1-381.5(f)(2), did the legislature intend to include within that subsection a premium finance company\u2019s request for termination of an insurance policy when the insured has given that company a power of attorney to request the policy\u2019s cancellation in the event of a default in payment of the premium? We hold that the legislature did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\">Reading Code \u00a7 38.1-381.5 in its entirety, we perceive a legislative intent to provide specified procedural safeguards to an insured when his insurance policy is terminated against his wishes. Code \u00a7 38.1-381.5(e) requires the insurer to notify the insured of the reason for cancellation, the availability of other insurance, the insured\u2019s right to a more detailed statement of the reasons for cancellation, and the insured\u2019s right to a review of the insurer\u2019s action. This requirement makes certain the insured is informed of his right to challenge involuntary cancellation in order that he may take the necessary steps to procure continuous insurance coverage when an insurer has cancelled the insured\u2019s policy against his wishes. The policy reasons for granting these rights are applicable whenever an insurance policy is being terminated involuntarily, whether by the insurance company at its own initiative or at the request of a premium finance company. The exemption provided in Code \u00a7 38.1-381.5(f)(2) is merely an acknowledgement that these procedural safeguards serve absolutely no purpose where an insured has voluntarily cancelled his policy, has indicated he does not wish to renew the policy, or has failed to accept the insurer\u2019s renewal offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">We also perceive an intention by the General Assembly to view an insurer\u2019s cancellation of policy coverage at the request of a premium finance company to be a cancellation against the insured\u2019s wishes. One of two authorized reasons for involuntary cancellation of a policy is the insured\u2019s failure to meet premium payment obligations \u201cwhether payable to the company or its agent either directly or indirectly under any premium finance plan or extension of credit.\u201d Code \u00a7 38.1-381.5(d)(2). In addition to granting insurers the power to terminate a policy at the request of a premium finance company, the quoted language evidences the legislature\u2019s apparent conclusion that an insurer\u2019s cancellation at the request of a premium finance company is a form of involun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>tary termination triggering the procedural safeguards provided in Code \u00a7 38.1-381.5(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">We thus conclude that when the General Assembly exempted from the safeguards of Code \u00a7 38.1-381.5(e) instances where \u201cthe named insured\u201d has notified the insurer \u201cthat he wishes the policy to be cancelled,\u201d the legislature did not intend to exempt cancellation requests by a premium finance company, even when the insured had previously given the company a power of attorney to request such cancellation in the event of a premium payment default. Even though requested by Thico to cancel Mayton\u2019s policy, American was obliged to meet the involuntary cancellation prerequisites set forth in Code \u00a7 38.1-381.5(e)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">For the reasons stated, we will affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b568-8\"> Code \u00a7 38.1-381.5(e)(2) provides that the cancellation date shall be not less than 15 days from the date the cancellation notice was mailed or delivered if the policy is being cancelled because of the reason set forth in Code \u00a7 38.1-381.5(d)(2). Code \u00a7 38.1-381.5(d)(2) allows an insurer to cancel the insured\u2019s policy if the insured \u201cfails to discharge when due any of his obligations in connection with the payment of premium for the policy or any installment thereof, |Whether payable to the company or its agent either directly or indirectly under any premium finance plan or extension of credit.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b568-9\"> While the cancellation date provided in the notice to Mayton did not meet the 15-day provision set forth in Code \u00a7 38.1-381.5(e)(2), the accident occurred more than 15 days after the notice had been mailed. American has conceded, however, that it cannot prevail if the notice requirement is applicable even though the accident occurred after the expiration of the 15-day period required by Code \u00a7 38.1-381.5(e)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
