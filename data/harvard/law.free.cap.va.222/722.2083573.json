Eure, Jr. (Eure and Johnson, </em>on brief), for appellant. <em>Linwood T. Wells, Jr., Assistant Attorney General (Marshall Coleman, Attorney General, </em>on brief), for appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b760-6\">CARRICO, C.J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AeK\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-7\">The defendant, James Calvin Blythe, was indicted separately for murder and the unlawful shooting, stabbing, cutting, or wounding of another in the commission of a felony (Code \u00a7 18.2-53). In a single jury trial, the defendant was convicted of voluntary manslaughter, with punishment fixed at ten years\u2019 imprisonment, and of the wounding charge, with punishment fixed at five years\u2019 imprisonment. The trial court imposed the prison terms fixed by the jury and ordered that the defendant serve the sentences consecutively.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-8\">The charges against the defendant grew but of a domestic dispute on June 18, 1980, during which the defendant stabbed his mother\u2019s boyfriend, Earl Rivers. Medical evidence showed Rivers died from stab wounds to the neck and chest.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-9\">On appeal, the defendant contends that to convict and sentence him for both voluntary manslaughter and unlawful wounding violates statutory and constitutional prohibitions against multiple punishments for the same offense. The statutory argument is based upon Code \u00a7 19.2-294, which provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-10\">If the same act be a violation of two or more statutes . . . conviction under one of such statutes . . . shall be a bar to a prosecution or proceeding under the other or others.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b760-11\">The defendant maintains that, because his single act of stabbing Rivers violated both Code \u00a7 18.2-35,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> relating to voluntary manslaughter, and \u00a7 18.2-53,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> concerning unlawful wounding, conviction under the first statute bars conviction under the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>Section 19.2-294, however, applies only where two or more <em>statutory </em>offenses are involved. While the unlawful shooting, stabbing, cutting, or wounding of another is a statutory offense, voluntary manslaughter is not; manslaughter is a common law offense. Section 18.2-35, cited by the defendant and quoted in footnote 1, merely fixes the punishment for voluntary manslaughter; the section does not define the offense. Therefore, \u00a7 19.2-294 does not bar the defendant\u2019s conviction and punishment for both voluntary manslaughter and unlawful wounding.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">In his constitutional argument, the defendant focuses upon the provision that no person \u201cshall ... for the same offense ... be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.\u201d U.S. Const., amend. V. The defendant reiterates his view concerning the singularity of his criminal act and emphasizes the sameness of the evidence supporting his convictions. The defendant asserts that the wounding charge was a lesser included offense of the murder charge, upon which he was convicted of voluntary manslaughter, and, thus, that his case satisfies the \u201csame evidence\u201d test formulated to determine the identity of offenses for double jeopardy purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">The constitutional provision concerning double jeopardy embodies three guarantees: \u201c(1) \u2018It protects against a second prosecution for the same offense after acquittal. [(2)] It protects against a second prosecution for the same offense after conviction. [(3)] And it protects against multiple punishments for the same offense.\u2019\u201d <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Vitale, </em>447 U.S. 410, 415 (1980), quoting <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Pearce, </em>395 U.S. 711, 717 (1969). Because both the defendant\u2019s convictions occurred in a single trial, only the third guarantee, <em>viz., </em>that against multiple punishments, is pertinent to resolution of the present appeal. <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, 221 </em>Va. 513, 529, 273 S.E.2d 36, 46-47 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b761-7\">In the single-trial setting, \u201cthe role of the constitutional guarantee is limited to assuring that the court does not exceed its legislative authorization by imposing multiple punishments for the same offense.\u201d <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>432 U.S. 161, 165 (1977). And, \u201cthe question whether punishments imposed by a court after a defendant\u2019s conviction upon criminal charges are unconstitutionally multiple cannot be resolved without determining what punishments the Legislative Branch has authorized.\u201d <em>Whalen </em>v. <em>United States, </em>445 U.S. 684, 688 (1980). Or, stated another way, \u201cthe question of what punishments are constitutionally permissible is not different from the question of what punishments the Legisla<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>tive Branch intended to be imposed.\u201d <em>Whalen, </em>445 U.S. at 698 (Blackmun, J., concurring). See also <em>Busic </em>v. <em>United States, </em>446 U.S. 398, 413 (1980) (Blackmun, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">The question resolves itself, therefore, into one of legislative intent where the issue is whether \u201cthe Legislative Branch\u201d has provided that two offenses may be punished cumulatively. In divining this intent, the test to be applied is \u201cwhether each [offense] requires proof of a fact which the other does not.\u201d <em>Blockburger </em>v. <em>United States, </em>284 U.S. 299, 304 (1932). And, in applying this test, the two offenses are to be examined in the abstract, rather than with reference to the facts of the particular case under review. <em>Whalen, </em>445 U.S. at 694 n.8.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">We believe that, when viewed in the abstract, the charges involved in the present case qualify as separate offenses within the meaning of the <em>Blockburger </em>test and, therefore, that one offense is not lesser included within the other. The offense of murder, one of the charges against the defendant, requires proof of the victim\u2019s death; the other charge, a violation of \u00a7 18.2-53, does not require proof of this fact. The \u00a7 18.2-53 charge requires proof of a shooting, stabbing, cutting, or wounding.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The murder charge does not require proof of any of these facts; murder may be committed by other means, <em>e.g., </em>by suffocating or poisoning the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">The defendant argues, however, that \u00a7 18.2-53 does not indicate any legislative intent that the punishment prescribed for a violation of the section should be in addition to the penalty provided for the primary felony in whose commission the shooting, stabbing, cutting, or wounding of another occurs. To support this argument, the defendant cites \u00a7 18.2-53.1, which prohibits the use or display of a firearm in the commission of murder, rape, robbery, burglary, malicious wounding, and abduction. As the defendant points out, \u00a7 18.2-53.1 provides that a violation of this section \u201cshall constitute a separate and distinct felony\u201d and that punishment therefor \u201cshall be separate and apart from, and shall be made to run consecutively with, any punishment received for the commission of the primary felony.\u201d Because a similar expression of intent does not appear in \u00a7 18.2-53, the defendant says, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>\u201cthe legislature did not intend to make Section 18.2-53 a separate offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">We disagree with the defendant. The purpose of \u00a7 18.2-53 is to deter the use of specific forms of violence and thus lessen the risk of bodily harm to the potential victims.of felonious crime. To effectuate this purpose, the General Assembly employed the only appropriate means available, <em>viz., </em>the imposition of punishment for the use of such violence in addition to the penalty prescribed for the primary felony. We believe the legislative intent to authorize cumulative punishment is clear in \u00a7 18.2-53, despite the absence of an express statement to that effect; indeed, we can perceive no other reason for the enactment of the section.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">For the reasons assigned, the judgment of the trial court will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b760-12\"> \u00a7 18.2-35. <em>How voluntary manslaughter punished. </em>\u2014 Voluntary manslaughter is punishable as a Class 5 felony.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b760-13\"><em> </em>\u00a7 18.2-53. <em>Shooting, etc., in committing or attempting a felony. </em>\u2014 If any person in the commission of, or attempt to commit, felony, unlawfully shoot, stab, cut or wound another person he shall be guilty of a Class 6 felony.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b762-8\"> Consistently, we have interpreted the term \u201cwounding,\u201d as used in statutes similar to \u00a7 18.2-53, to require proof of a breaking of the skin. <em>Shackelford </em>v.
