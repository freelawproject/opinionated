The proposed facilities included rebuilding an existing 115 kilovolt (kv) line to 230 kv between the Idylwood and Tysons Substations. Code \u00a7 56-46.1 requires Commission approval of electrical transmission lines of 200 kv or more.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-5\">After the required notice was given to the public and to the Board of Supervisors and Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney of Fairfax County (collectively the County), the Commission, on August 11, 1975, entered an order approving the application. The Commission received no objections to the application, and no appeal was taken from the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-6\">In November, 1977, the County filed with the Commission a petition requesting it to declare null and void the August, 1975 order on the ground that the Commission lacked jurisdiction. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>Vepco moved to dismiss the petition and, following oral arguments, the Commission, on March 4, 1981, granted the motion. This appeal of right ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-5\">Vepco had acquired easements for the proposed power line corridor prior to April 8, 1972. However, Vepco\u2019s rights-of-way across three parcels contained voltage and pole height restrictions which made it impossible to build a 230 kv line. In 1976 and 1977, Vepco acquired rights-of-way for the 230 kv transmission line across these three parcels.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b909-6\">Code \u00a7 56-46.1 requires the Commission to determine that proposed transmission line corridors \u201cwill reasonably minimize adverse impact on the scenic and environmental assets of the area concerned.\u201d However, the section applies only to \u201ctransmission lines for which rights-of-way acquisitions have not been completed as of April eight, nineteen hundred and seventy-two.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b909-7\">The County contends that the Commission is without jurisdiction because \u201cthe rights-of-way had been acquired prior to April 8, 1972.\u201d Asserting that the phrase \u201crights-of-way\u201d as used in the statute describes \u201cthe physical corridor or strip of land itself,\u201d the County concludes that the rights acquired by Vepco in 1976 and 1977 did not constitute \u201crights-of-way acquisitions\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 56-46.1. Therefore, it reasoned that \u201csince it is undisputed that the strip of land or corridor over which the proposed 230 kv line is to be constructed has existed prior to April 8, 1972, as a route for transmission lines, the Commission was without jurisdiction to authorize construction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b909-8\">Vepco responds that the County\u2019s interpretation of \u201crights-of-way\u201d is too narrow and restrictive. The company asserts that the term includes both the physical corridor or route and the legal right of passage over the land of another. It further argues that the two meanings are not mutually exclusive but \u201care interwined,\u201d and that \u201cboth meanings should be utilized in determining the scope of the statute and the jurisdiction of the State Corporation Commission under it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b909-9\">In enacting Code \u00a7 56-46.1, the General Assembly recognized that environmental concerns should be considered in constructing high voltage transmission lines. Moreover, in vesting jurisdiction with the Commission to approve such lines, the General Assembly specifically preempted local zoning ordinances. This not only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>evinces the General Assembly\u2019s view that such construction should be governed by statewide uniform regulations but also takes into account the practicality that such lines often traverse several counties.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-5\">The language in issue was designed to protect those utilities which had acquired rights-of-way, but had not started construction, before the act was passed. The County\u2019s interpretation would exempt any transmission line from statewide control, as long as the utility used an existing corridor. There is nothing in the language, history, or spirit of the section to support such an interpretation, and we reject it.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-6\">In the present case, the evidence is undisputed that some of the existing rights-of-way could not be used for the proposed facilities. They had certain restrictions which had to be removed before the new line could be constructed. Since acquisition of the requisite rights-of-way for the construction of the proposed line had not been completed prior to April 8, 1972, we hold that the Commission had jurisdiction over Vepco\u2019s application, and the Commission\u2019s order will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b907-14\"> \u00a7 56-46.1. <em>Commission to consider environmental factors in approving construction of electrical utility facilities; approval required for construction of certain electrical transmission lines; notice and hearings. </em>\u2014 Whenever under any provision of law whatsoever, applicable to the Commission, the Commission is required to approve the construction of any electrical utility facility, it shall give consideration to the effect of that facility on the environment and establish such conditions as may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>be desirable or necessary to minimize adverse environmental impact. In such proceedings it shall receive and give consideration to all reports that relate to the proposed facility by State agencies concerned with environmental protection; and, if \u25a0requested by any county or municipality in which the facility is proposed to be built, to local comprehensive plans that have been adopted pursuant to article 4 (\u00a7 15.1-446.1 et seq.) of chapter 11 of Title 15.1 of the Code of Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-8\">No electrical transmission line of two hundred kilovolts or more shall be constructed unless the State Corporation Commission shall, after at least thirty days\u2019 advance notice by publication in a newspaper or newspapers of general circulation in the counties and municipalities through which the line is proposed to be built, and written notice to the governing body of each such county and municipality, approve such line. As a condition to such approval the Commission shall determine that the corridor or route the line is to follow will reasonably minimize adverse impact on the scenic and environmental assets of the area concerned. If, prior to such approval, any interested party shall request a public hearing the Commission shall, as soon as reasonably practicable after such request, hold such hearing or hearings at such place as may be designated by the Commission. <em>This section shall apply to such transmission lines for which rights-of-way acquisitions have not been completed as of April eight, nineteen hundred seventy-two. </em>In any such hearing the public service company shall provide adequate evidence that existing rights-of-way cannot adequately serve the needs of said company.
