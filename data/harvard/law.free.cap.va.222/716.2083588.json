Ruling that the Bank was a holder in due course entitled to recover on the notes, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>court entered a separate judgment against each set of makers.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We granted the Makers an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">The record shows that, in 1972, Dr. Sven Ebbesson induced six of his colleagues in the medical field to join him in a cattle venture. The venture consisted of a corporation known as Solhem Farm, Inc., with Ebbesson as president and major shareholder, and a partnership known as Polled Exotics Limited Partnership (Polled), with Ebbesson as general partner and his six colleagues as limited partners.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">To commence the business, Ebbesson negotiated with Edward Shield, president of United, to have United purchase cattle and lease them to Polled. As collateral to insure performance of the lease obligations, Polled transferred to United seven promissory notes, each executed by a different partner and his wife and made payable to the order of Polled.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The transfer to United was evidenced by a separate assignment agreement and not by any writing entered upon, or attached to, the notes themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">Shield, on behalf of United, negotiated with the Bank for a loan to purchase the cattle to be leased to Polled. As collateral, United transferred to the Bank the cattle lease executed by Polled and the seven promissory notes United had received from Polled.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-7\">After the Bank\u2019s loan to United was closed, the cattle operation commenced and the Makers began paying United the annual installments due on their notes. Ultimately, the cattle venture suffered financial reverses, and the Makers undertook an investigation of the operation. Thereafter, the Makers ceased paying the notes and instituted a fraud action against Polled in the United States District Court for the Western District of Virginia. Finding that the notes had been procured from the Makers by fraud, the District Court declared the notes void <em>ab initio </em>as between the Makers and Polled. The Bank was not a party to this proceeding.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b754-8\">Following cessation of the Makers\u2019 payments, United defaulted on its loan obligation to the Bank. The Bank obtained judgment against United for the balance due on the debt and, failing to se<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>cure satisfaction of that judgment, brought the present action against the Makers.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-4\">On appeal, the focal point of the controversy between the parties is a provision contained in each of the notes executed by the Makers. The provision reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-5\">The makers of this Note agree that Polled Exotics Limited Partnership, or its assignees, may freely assign or negotiate this Note in whole or in part from time to time without notice to the makers; however, if the makers of this Note are given notice of such an assignment or negotiation, the makers agree to acknowledge receipt thereof in writing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">Section 1-102(3) of the Uniform Commercial Code (Va. Code \u00a7 8.1-102(3)) provides that \u201c[t]he effect of provisions of this act may be varied by agreement.\u201d The Official Comment to this section reads in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-7\">2. Subsection (3) states affirmatively at the outset that freedom of contract is a principle of the Code: \u201cthe effect\u201d of its provisions may be varied by \u201cagreement.\u201d The meaning of the statute itself must be found in its text, including its definitions, and in appropriate extrinsic aids; it cannot be varied by agreement. . . . Thus private parties cannot make an instrument negotiable within the meaning of Article 3 except as provided in Section 3-104; nor can they change the meaning of such terms as \u201cbona fide purchaser,\u201d \u201cholder in due course,\u201d or \u201cdue negotiation,\u201d as used in this Act. But an agreement can change the legal consequences which would otherwise flow from the provisions of the Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b755-8\">In reaching the conclusion that the Bank was a holder in due course not subject to the fraud defenses of the Makers, the trial court held that the parties had \u201ccontract [ed] as to the effect of the Commercial Code\u2019s provisions\u201d by providing for the assignment of the notes \u201cwithout suffering the usual effect of loss of negotiability.\u201d Thus, the court found, United had the \u201ccapacity to negotiate the notes\u201d to the extent that the Bank became a holder in due course.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-9\">The Makers contend that by allowing the disputed provision of the notes to stand, the trial court has permitted the parties to vary the meaning of such U.C.C. terms as \u201cdue negotiation\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>\u201cholder in due course.\u201d This is the very sort of change that the U.C.C. prohibits, the Makers insist, and, hence, the trial court\u2019s findings are erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">On the other hand, the Bank contends that the disputed provision did not change \u201cany concept or definition\u201d of the U.C.C. The Bank argues that the \u201clanguage of the Notes only varied the legal consequence of lost negotiability which would otherwise have attended an assignment of the Notes to United Leasing.\u201d The Bank maintains that, since this type of variance is allowed by the U.C.C., the trial court properly held United was authorized to negotiate the notes so as to permit the Bank to become a holder in due course.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">We agree with the Bank that by allowing United, a mere assignee, to negotiate the notes, the disputed provision varied the legal consequences ordinarily attending an assignment. We do not agree, however, that only legal consequences were altered; we believe the provision also changed concepts or definitions of the U.C.C. contrary to the previously quoted Official Comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">In pertinent part, \u00a7 3-202 of the U.C.C. provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-7\">(1) Negotiation is the transfer of an instrument in such form that the transferee becomes a holder. If the instrument is payable to order it is negotiated by delivery with any necessary indorsement; if payable to bearer it is negotiated by delivery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-8\">(2) An indorsement must be written by or on behalf of the holder and on the instrument or on a paper so firmly affixed thereto as to become a part thereof.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b756-9\">In \u00a7 1-201(20), a holder is defined as \u201ca person who is in possession of ... an instrument . . . issued or indorsed to him or to his order or to bearer or in blank.\u201d And, in \u00a7 3-302, a holder in due course is defined as a \u201cholder who takes the instrument\u201d under specified conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-10\">These sections provide that, before a transferee of a promissory note can become a holder in due course, he must first qualify as a holder. A transferee may become a holder of order paper only by \u201cnegotiation,\u201d that is, by indorsement and delivery, and the indorsement must be by or on behalf of a person who is himself a holder.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>Without the disputed provision, it is clear that, because United took the notes by mere assignment and not through the indorsement of Polled, United was not a holder. Thus, United could not \u201cnegotiate\u201d the notes so as to permit its transferee, the Bank, to qualify as a holder. Therefore, to the extent that the disputed provision purported to authorize United, as a mere assignee, to negotiate the notes, the provision necessarily changed the meaning of the terms \u201cholder\u201d and \u201cdue negotiation\u201d and, hence, of the term \u201cholder in due course.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b757-4\">When the provision is given its obvious import relative to the order paper in question, it attempts to equate a \u201cholder\u201d with a mere possessor and to make \u201cdue negotiation\u201d synonymous with delivery accompanied only by assignment. Correspondingly, the provision attempts to convert the meaning of \u201cholder in due course\u201d to one who possesses order paper by assignment. But the U.C.C. does not permit this sort of alteration of the meaning of the inviolable terms \u201cdue negotiation\u201d and \u201cholder in due course.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">We hold, therefore, that the judgments entered against the Makers are erroneous. Accordingly, we will reverse the judgments and remand the case for further proceedings not inconsistent with the views expressed in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b753-13\"> The Makers are Donald P.
