In particular, the Court of Appeals erred by not recognizing the clear legislative intent reflected in the plain language of the statute precluding multiple punishments for OWI and OWI-injury. Accordingly, for the reasons stated below, we affirm the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision to vacate defendant\u2019s OWI conviction under MCL 257.625(1) on alternate grounds and remand to the trial court for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b245-9\">In June 2012, while returning from a concert at which they had both been drinking alcohol, defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>and his girlfriend got into an argument. Defendant grabbed the wheel from his girlfriend, who was driving, causing the car to go off the road and strike a tree. Defendant\u2019s girlfriend suffered a broken collar bone and a concussion as a result of the accident. Defendant had a blood alcohol level of 0.17 grams per 100 milliliters.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-3\">Defendant was charged with OWI and OWI-injury. A jury convicted defendant as charged. The trial court sentenced defendant to two concurrent terms of five years\u2019 probation, with the first nine months to be served in the county jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">Defendant appealed to the Court of Appeals, arguing that the trial court violated the multiple punishments strand of the double jeopardy clauses by convicting him of both OWI and OWI-injury. The Court of Appeals agreed, vacated defendant\u2019s OWI conviction under MCL 257.625(1), and remanded the case for resentenc-ing.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The prosecution moved for reconsideration, arguing that the Court of Appeals\u2019 analysis was contrary to <em>People v Ream,</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>but the Court of Appeals denied the motion in a summary order.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">The prosecution sought leave to appeal in this Court. We granted leave to consider whether defendant\u2019s convictions for both OWI and OWI-injury arising from the same incident constitutes a violation of the multiple punishments strand of double jeopardy under the United States and Michigan Constitutions.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">This case presents questions of law regarding statutory interpretation and the application of our state and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>federal Constitutions, which we review de novo.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">III. MULTIPLE PUNISHMENTS STRAND OF DOUBLE JEOPARDY</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">The Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution provides that no person shall \u201cbe subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Michigan Constitution similarly provides that \u201c[n]o person shall be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The prohibition against double jeopardy protects individuals in three ways: \u201c(1) it protects against a second prosecution for the same offense after acquittal; (2) it protects against a second prosecution for the same offense after conviction; and (3) it protects against multiple punishments for the same offense.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The first two protections comprise the \u201csuccessive prosecutions\u201d strand of double jeopardy, while the third protection is known as the \u201cmultiple punishments\u201d strand.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Because defendant was convicted of and sentenced for both OWI and OWI-injury arising from the same conduct at the same trial, this case involves the multiple punishments strand of double jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">The multiple punishments strand of double jeopardy \u201cis designed to ensure that courts confine their sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>tences to the limits established by the Legislature\u201d and therefore acts as a \u201crestraint on the prosecutor and the Courts.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The multiple punishments strand is not violated \u201c[w]here <em>\u2018a </em>legislature specifically authorizes cumulative punishment under two statutes . . . \u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Conversely, where the Legislature expresses a clear intention in the plain language of a statute to prohibit multiple punishments, it will be a violation of the multiple punishments strand for a trial court to cumulatively punish a defendant for both offenses in a single trial.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> \u201cThus, the question of what punishments are constitutionally permissible is not different from the question of what punishments the Legislative Branch intended to be imposed.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>The Legislature, however, does not always clearly indicate its intent with regard to the permissibility of multiple punishments. When legislative intent is not clear, Michigan courts apply the \u201cabstract legal elements\u201d test articulated in <em>Ream </em>to ascertain whether the Legislature intended to classify two offenses as the \u201csame offense\u201d for double jeopardy purposes. This test focuses on the statutory elements of the offense to determine whether the Legislature intended for multiple punishments.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Under the abstract legal elements test, it is not a violation of double jeopardy to convict a defendant of multiple offenses if \u201ceach of the offenses for which defendant was convicted has an element that the other does not. . . .\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> This means that, under the <em>Ream </em>test, two offenses will only be considered the \u201csame offense\u201d where it is impossible to commit the greater offense without also committing the lesser offense.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">In sum, when considering whether two offenses are the \u201csame offense\u201d in the context of the multiple punishments strand of double jeopardy, we must first determine whether the statutory language evinces a legislative intent with regard to the permissibility of multiple punishments. If the legislative intent is clear, courts are required to abide by this intent.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> If, however, the legislative intent is not clear, courts must then apply the abstract legal elements test articulated in <em>Ream </em>to discern legislative intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>IV. ANALYSIS AND APPLICATION</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">Subsections (1) through (8) of MCL 257.625 establish different categories of operating while intoxicated offenses. In this case, we must determine whether double jeopardy precludes defendant\u2019s convictions of OWI under MCL 257.625(1) and OWI-injury under MCL 257.625(5) arising from a single intoxicated driving incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">MCL 257.625(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-7\">A person, whether licensed or not, shall not operate a vehicle upon a highway or other place open to the general public or generally accessible to motor vehicles, including an area designated for the parking of vehicles, within this state if the person is operating while intoxicated. As used in this section, \u201coperating while intoxicated\u201d means any of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-8\">(a) The person is under the influence of alcoholic liquor, a controlled substance, or other intoxicating substance or a combination of alcoholic liquor, a controlled substance, or other intoxicating substance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-9\">(b) The person has an alcohol content of 0.08 grams or more per 100 milliliters of blood, per 210 liters of breath, or per 67 milliliters of urine, or, beginning October 1,2018, the person has an alcohol content of 0.10 grams or more per 100 milliliters of blood, per 210 liters of breath, or per 67 milliliters of urine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-10\">(c) The person has an alcohol content of 0.17 grams or more per 100 milliliters of blood, per 210 liters of breath, or per 67 milliliters of urine.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b250-11\">MCL 257.625(5) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-12\">A person, whether licensed or not, who operates a motor vehicle in violation of subsection (1), (3), or (8) and by the operation of that motor vehicle causes a serious impairment of a body function of another person is guilty of a crime as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>(a) Except as provided in subdivision (b), the person is guilty of a felony punishable by imprisonment for not more than 5 years or a fine of not less than $1,000.00 or more than $5,000.00, or both. The judgment of sentence may impose the sanction permitted under section 625n. If the vehicle is not ordered forfeited under section 625n, the court shall order vehicle immobilization under section 904d in the judgment of sentence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-5\">(b) If the violation occurs while the person has an alcohol content of 0.17 grams or more per 100 milliliters of blood, per 210 liters of breath, or per 67 milliliters of urine, and within 7 years of a prior conviction, the person is guilty of a felony punishable by imprisonment for not more than 10 years or a fine of not less than $1,000.00 or more than $5,000.00, or both. The judgment of sentence may impose the sanction permitted under section 625n. If the vehicle is not ordered forfeited under section 625n, the court shall order vehicle immobilization under section 904d in the judgment of sentence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">As stated above, to determine whether defendant\u2019s convictions of both OWI and OWI-injury violated his double jeopardy rights, we must first determine whether the Legislature expressed a clear intent regarding the permissibility of multiple operating while intoxicated convictions arising from the same incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">The Court of Appeals concluded, based on an examination of the plain language of MCL 257.625, that the Legislature did not \u201cevince a clear expression of any intent to allow multiple punishments for the same offense.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> In doing so, the Court focused on MCL 257.625(25) and (27). MCL 257.625(25)(b) defines \u201cprior convictions\u201d and includes as part of that definition a violation of \u201c[t]his section\u201d or a \u201csubstantially corresponding\u201d local ordinance, federal law, or law of another state. MCL 257.625(27) provides that \u201c[i]f 2 or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>more convictions described in subsection (25) are convictions for violations arising out of the same transaction, only 1 conviction shall be used to determine whether the person has a prior conviction.\u201d The Court of Appeals concluded that the Legislature did not clearly state its intent with regard to multiple punishments under these subsections because Subsection (25) includes \u201cas part of its definition of \u2018prior conviction\u2019 a conviction from a foreign jurisdiction of a law that \u2018substantially correspond^] to a law of this state,\u201d which may allow multiple punishments for a single transaction and thus Subsection (27) merely \u201climit [s] how those multiple convictions are to be handled with respect to calculating a defendant\u2019s number of \u2018prior convictions.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">We agree with the Court of Appeals that MCL 257.625(25) and (27) do not indicate a clear legislative intent with regard to the permissibility of multiple punishments. While MCL 257.625(27) considers the possibility that a defendant could be convicted of multiple offenses arising out of the same transaction, it is not clear whether the Legislature contemplated these multiple offenses as arising solely under Michigan law, the laws of another jurisdiction that \u201csubstantially correspond\u00ed] to a law of this state,\u201d or a combination thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">Despite the Court of Appeals\u2019 proper analysis of these subsections, our review of MCL 257.625 as a whole leads us to conclude that the Legislature did express a clear intent with regard to multiple punishments arising under MCL 257.625(1) and (5). As with any statutory interpretation, we must give effect to the Legislature\u2019s intent by focusing first on the statute\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>plain language.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> When statutory language is clear and unambiguous, we assume that the Legislature intended its plain meaning and we enforce the statute as written.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Here, MCL 257.625(1) and (5) are silent on the issue of multiple punishments and thus do not, when read in isolation, clearly evidence the Legislature\u2019s intent on whether multiple punishments are allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">However, we do not quarantine the text when interpreting statutes. Instead, we must examine the statutory language as a whole to determine the Legislature\u2019s intent.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> In this respect, we find it significant that the Legislature specifically authorized multiple punishments for some operating while intoxicated offenses in another subsection of the statute.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> MCL 257.625(7) creates a separate operating while intoxicated offense for individuals who drive while intoxicated with a minor in the car (OWI-minor).<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Subsection (7)(d) provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-6\">This subsection <em>does not prohibit a person from being charged with, convicted of, or punished for a violation of subsection (4) or (5) that is committed by the person while violating this subsection. </em>However, points shall not be assessed under section 320a for both a violation of subsection (4) or (5) and a violation of this subsection for conduct arising out of the same transaction.[<footnotemark>27</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b254-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>Thus, under MCL 257.625(7)(d), the Legislature specifically authorized multiple convictions and punishments for a person who commits OWI-minor and by that same conduct also commits OWI-injury or causes \u201cthe death of another person\u201d under MCL 257.625(4) (OWI-death).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">The specific authorization for multiple punishments contained in MCL 257.625(7)(d) leads us to conclude that the Legislature did <em>not </em>intend to permit multiple punishments for OWI and OWI-injury offenses arising from the same incident. While Subsection (7) expressly authorizes multiple punishments for certain operating while intoxicated offenses, this authorization is limited to the circumstances described in MCL 257.625(7)(d). And interpreting this subsection in the context of the statute as a whole leads us to conclude that the Legislature intended to exclude all other multiple punishments under MCL 257.625.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> This implication is particularly probative of legislative intent in this case because the express authorization of multiple punishments in Subsection (7)(d) involves one of the subsections under examination in this case, MCL 257.625(5). The fact that the Legislature expressly authorized multiple punishments for Subsection (5) and a subsection other than Subsection (1) demonstrates that the Legislature did not intend to permit multiple punishments for violations of Subsections (1) and (5).<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> In other words, if the Legislature had intended to allow multiple punishments for Subsections (1) and (5), it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>clearly knew how to do so, as evidenced by the specific authorization in MCL 257.625(7)(d).<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> But neither MCL 257.625(1) nor (5) contains similar language specifically authorizing the conviction of and punishment for multiple offenses. Thus, in light of MCL 257.625(7)(d), the omission of a similar clause providing explicit authority to convict a defendant of multiple operating while intoxicated offenses arising out of the same incident in either MCL 257.625(1) or (5) is a clear indication that the Legislature did not intend for defendants to be convicted of and punished for OWI and OWI-injury arising out of the same incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">Further, to reach the opposite conclusion would violate our well-recognized rule that we \u201cmust give effect to every word, phrase, and clause and avoid an interpretation that would render any part of the statute surplusage or nugatory.\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> That is, had the Legislature generally intended to allow multiple punishments for every category of operating while intoxicated offense arising from the same conduct, there would have been no need for the Legislature to specifically authorize multiple punishments for OWI-minor and OWI-death or OWI-injury. To interpret MCL 257.625 as permitting multiple punishments for other operating while intoxicated offenses would improperly render the specific authorization under MCL 257.625(7)(d) surplusage.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">Therefore, the Court of Appeals erred by concluding that the Legislature did not \u201cevince a clear expression of any intent to allow . . . multiple punishments for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>same offense.\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> In light of the express statutory language permitting multiple punishments in MCL 257.625(7)(d), the fact that MCL 257.625(1) and (5) do not contain any express authorization for multiple punishments indicates that the Legislature did not intend to permit a defendant to be convicted of both of these offenses for the same criminal conduct.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Accordingly, we hold that the trial court violated the double jeopardy prohibition by convicting defendant of both OWI under MCL 257.625(1) and OWI-injury under MCL 257.625(5).<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">V. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">We conclude that defendant\u2019s convictions of both OWI and OWI-injury for the same intoxicated driving incident violates the multiple punishments prong of the double jeopardy clauses. Based on the plain language of MCL 257.625, the Legislature expressed a clear intent not to allow conviction of and punishment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>for multiple offenses arising from the same conduct, except where explicitly authorized by the statute. Therefore, the Court of Appeals reached the right result when it vacated defendant\u2019s OWI conviction.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> However, the Court of Appeals did so for the wrong reasons. Accordingly, we affirm the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision to vacate defendant\u2019s OWI conviction under MCL 257.625(1) on alternate grounds and remand to the trial court for resentencing.</p>\n<judges id=\"b257-5\">Young, C.J., and Markman, Kelly, Zahra, McCormack, and Bernstein, JJ., concurred with Viviano, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b245-10\"> MCL 257.625(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"AqH0\"> MCL 257.625(5).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"APt8\"> US Const, Am V; Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 15.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b246-8\"> <em>People v Miller, </em>unpublished opinion per curiam of the Court of Appeals, issued March 11, 2014 (Docket No. 314375).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"Avi3\"> <em>People v Ream, </em>481 Mich 223; 750 NW2d 536 (2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"AQ2\"> <em>People v Miller, </em>497 Mich 881 (2014).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b247-8\"> <em>People v Gardner, </em>482 Mich 41, 46; 753 NW2d 78 (2008); <em>People v Nutt, </em>469 Mich 565, 573; 677 NW2d 1 (2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b247-9\"> US Const, Am V.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b247-10\"> Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 15.
