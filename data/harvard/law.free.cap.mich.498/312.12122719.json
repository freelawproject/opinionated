Their members are the beneficiaries of and participants in Michigan\u2019s retirement system established under the State Employees\u2019 Retirement Act (SERA).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> SERA was enacted in 1943 and has been amended many times since. Plaintiffs challenge the most recent SERA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>amendment, 2011 PA 264. They contend that, because 2011 PA 264 increases the cost and reduces the accumulation of future pension benefits previously recognized, it unconstitutionally infringes the exclusive constitutional powers of the Civil Service Commission (commission) to manage and oversee the civil service system. The commission has never formally opposed or attempted to repudiate the application of SERA or any of its several amendments, including 2011 PA 264, to the employees of the state classified civil service.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">While the commission has considerable constitutional powers to manage the civil service system and to preserve its sphere of constitutional authority, the commission has no legislative powers. It may neither enact legislation nor revise an enactment, nor may it dictate that the Legislature repeal or modify an enactment. Therefore, we hold that because the commission has acquiesced in the application of SERA to the employees of the civil service system, plaintiffs objections fail to establish a basis for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand to the Court of Claims for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">I. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">A. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b546-9\">In 1940, through an initiative petition, the people of Michigan ratified a constitutional amendment establishing a state civil service system.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Const 1908, art 6, \u00a7 22 became effective on January 1,1941, and provided in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>The commission shall classify all positions in the state civil service according to their respective duties and responsibilities, fix rates of compensation for all classes of positions, approve or disapprove disbursements for all personal services, determine by competitive performance exclusively on the basis of merit, efficiency and fitness the qualifications of all candidates for positions in the state civil service, make rules and regulations covering all personnel transactions, and regulate all conditions of employment in the state civil service. No person shall be appointed to or promoted in the state civil service who has not been certified as so qualified for such appointment or promotion by the commission. No removals from or demotions in the state civil service shall be made for partisan, racial, or religious considerations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-3\">The administration of the commission\u2019s powers shall be vested in a state personnel director who shall be a member of the state civil service and who shall be responsible to and selected by the commission after open competitive examination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">Shortly after its creation, the commission promulgated a rule requiring its state personnel director to recommend that the Legislature establish a retirement plan for classified employees:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-5\">RETIREMENT. The director, in conjunction with appointing authorities, other supervising officials, the state budget director and members of the legislature, shall prepare and submit to the commission for approval and subsequent recommendation to the governor and the legislature for adoption by law, a comprehensive and workable contributory retirement system for employees in the state civil service.1<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>1</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">Apparently, the commission thereafter designed a model retirement plan, which it submitted to the Governor for comment. However, before the Governor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>completed his review of the commission\u2019s plan,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the precursor to SERA was introduced in the House of Representatives as House Bill No. 177.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> SERA was signed into law as 1943 PA 240, and was codified as MCL 38.1 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">Subsequently, the people ratified a new Constitution in 1963, which altered somewhat the way that the commission operates. Const 1963, art 11, \u00a7 5, \u00b6 4, remains largely unchanged from Const 1908, art 6, \u00a7 22, and provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-6\">The commission <em>shall </em>classify all positions in the classified service according to their respective duties and responsibilities, <em>fix rates of compensation for all classes of positions, </em>approve or disapprove disbursements for all personal services, determine by competitive examination and performance exclusively on the basis of merit, efficiency and fitness the qualifications of all candidates for positions in the classified service, make rules and regulations covering all personnel transactions, and <em>regulate all conditions of employment </em>in the classified service.[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">In the same section, however, the ratifiers introduced a new legislative check on compensation increases for civil servants authorized by the commission:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-8\">Increases in rates of compensation authorized by the commission maybe effective only at the start of a fiscal year <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>and shall require prior notice to the governor, who shall transmit such increases to the legislature as part of his budget. The legislature may, by a majority vote of the members elected to and serving in each house, waive the notice and permit increases in rates of compensation to be effective at a time other than the start of a fiscal year. <em>Within 60 calendar days following such transmission, the legislature may, by a two-thirds vote of the members elected to and serving in each house, reject or reduce increases in rates of compensation authorized by the commission. </em>Any reduction ordered by the legislature shall apply uniformly to all classes of employees affected by the increases and shall not adjust pay differentials already established by the civil service commission. The legislature may not reduce rates of compensation below those in effect at the time of the transmission of increases authorized by the commission.1<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>1</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b549-4\">Following the ratification of the 1963 Constitution, the commission replaced its initial retirement rule, Rule XXXVIII, but its replacement did not purport to fundamentally change the commission\u2019s <em>advisory </em>role in SERA\u2019s administration:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-5\">Section 31 \u2014 Retirement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-6\">31.1 Cooperation With State Retirement Board. \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-7\">The state personnel director shall <em>cooperate </em>with the State Employees\u2019 Retirement Board in maintaining a comprehensive contributory retirement system for state civil service employees.1<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>1</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">The commission\u2019s rules have remained substantively unchanged in this regard.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>B. 2011 PA 264</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">In 2011, the Legislature amended SERA.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Relevant to the instant case are the amendments of MCL 38. le, MCL 38.35a, and MCL 38.50a. Broadly speaking, the amendments (1) potentially reduce the value of overtime compensation as it factors into a member\u2019s pension formula for future benefits,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and (2) require members to make an election between paying to remain in a defined benefit plan (that was previously free), or instead joining a \u201cTier 2,\u201d 401(k)-style defined contribution plan.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">Plaintiffs argue that SERA retirement benefits are \u201crates of compensation\u201d or, alternatively, \u201cconditions of employment,\u201d as these terms are used in Const 1963, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>art 11, \u00a7 5. Accordingly, plaintiffs claim, SERA retirement benefits are not subject to legislative change because the regulation of \u201crates of compensation\u201d and \u201cconditions of employment\u201d of employees in the classified civil service is within the exclusive and plenary authority of the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">The Court of Claims held that 2011 PA 264 was unconstitutional. The Court of Appeals affirmed the ruling of the Court of Claims, concluding that SERA retirement benefits are properly classified as both \u201crates of compensation\u201d and \u201cconditions of employment,\u201d neither of which is subject to legislative alteration.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The state appealed and we granted leave, directing the parties to brief \u201cwhether 2011 PA 264 is unconstitutional, in whole or in part, in violation of Const 1963, art 11, \u00a7 5.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">III. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">This Court reviews the grant or denial of summary disposition de novo.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Questions of constitutional and statutory interpretation also are reviewed de novo.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">IV. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b552-9\">As noted, plaintiffs make two alternative arguments that by enacting 2011 PA 264, the Legislature infringed the commission\u2019s constitutional authority. First, plaintiffs allege that the pension accrual characteristics altered by 2011 PA 264 affect classified employees\u2019 \u201crates of compensation\u201d under Const 1963, art <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>11, \u00a7 5, and that the Legislature cannot act in that area. Second and in the alternative, plaintiffs allege that the pension accrual characteristics affected by 2011 PA 264 are \u201cconditions of employment\u201d under Const 1963, art 11, \u00a7 5. We address these two arguments in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\">A. \u201cRATES OF COMPENSATION\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">As used in Article 11, \u00a7 5, we conclude that the term \u201crates of compensation\u201d was not understood by the ratifiers of the 1963 constitution to include fringe benefits such as pensions; rather, the common understanding of the term at that time was that it included only salaries and wages.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">Our primary goal in construing a constitutional provision is to give effect to the intent of the people of the state of Michigan who ratified the Constitution, by applying the rule of \u201ccommon understanding.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> We locate the common understanding of constitutional text by determining the plain meaning of the text as it was understood at the time of ratification.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Interpretation of a constitutional provision also takes account of \u201cthe circumstances leading to the adoption of the provision and the purpose sought to be accomplished.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The Address to the People, which was dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>tributed to Michigan citizens in advance of the ratification vote and which explained in everyday language what each provision of the proposed new Constitution was intended to accomplish,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> and, to a lesser degree, the constitutional convention debates are also relevant to understanding the ratifiers\u2019 intent.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">Textual indicators in the Constitution uniformly indicate that the phrase \u201crates of compensation,\u201d as used in Article 11, \u00a7 5, was commonly understood to include only salaries and wages, i.e., amounts paid out to employees in a paycheck.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> For instance, Article 11, \u00a7 5 only reserves to the commission the authority to \u201cfix <em>rates </em>of compensation,\u201d rather than \u201ccompensation\u201d generally. In the context of compensation for one\u2019s employment-related services, \u201crate\u201d was defined as \u201ca wage paid on a specified time basis: <em>a salary figured on an hourly </em>rate.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> \u201cWages,\u201d in turn, was defined as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>\u201cmoney that is paid or received for work or services, <em>as by the hour, day, or week\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>24</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\">This understanding is confirmed elsewhere. Highly significant to our assessment is the Address to the People. Apart from the text of the Constitution itself, the Address provides an authoritative contemporary construction of the constitutional provisions that the citizens of Michigan were asked to vote on.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The Address confirms that \u201crates of compensation\u201d did not include fringe benefits such as pensions. As previously stated, the current \u00b6 7 of Article 11, \u00a7 5 gives the Legislature a supermajority veto over the commission\u2019s proposed changes to \u201crates of compensation.\u201d The Address explains that this provision \u201cprovides for limited legislative control of <em>wage increases </em>under specified circumstances.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The Address alternatively explains the same legislative control as pertaining to \u201cthe total level of state <em>payroll[.]\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>27</em></footnotemark><em> </em>\u201cCompensation\u201d was thus directly understood as the money employees received in their paychecks.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">Moreover, the portion of the Address explaining Article 11, \u00a7 5 states: \u201cOf special interest to civil service personnel is the provision in Sec. 24, Article IX, of the proposed constitution which specifies that pension plans and retirement systems of the state shall be contractual obligations \u2018which shall not be diminished <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>or impaired.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> The ratifiers were thus aware of the special independent status of pensions created for civil servants, as well as the new obligation imposed to protect any such pensions. This portion of the Address is especially noteworthy because, in discussing \u00b6 4 of Article 11, \u00a7 5, the Address directs the ratifiers\u2019 attention elsewhere to the provisions of Article 9, \u00a7 24 that expressly discuss pensions, while simultaneously equating \u201crates of compensation\u201d with wages. We conclude that this explanation confirms our textual construction based on the common understanding of \u201crates of compensation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">Finally, although of lesser import than the Address, the transcript of the constitutional convention debates further confirms that the common understanding of \u201crates of compensation\u201d did not extend to pensions. The record is replete with references to \u201cwages\u201d and \u201csalaries\u201d during discussion of the Legislature\u2019s then-proposed veto power over commission increases to \u201crates of compensation,\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> and there are no relevant references to \u201cpensions\u201d or \u201cretirement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">In conjunction with the text of Article 11, \u00a7 5 discussed earlier, these historical sources confirm that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>phrase \u201crates of compensation\u201d referred to salaries and wages as opposed to fringe benefits such as the SERA pension program. Accordingly, we find no merit in plaintiffs\u2019 argument that 2011 PA 264 infringes the commission\u2019s authority to regulate \u201crates of compensation,\u201d because the SERA pension program does not affect \u201crates of compensation\u201d as that term is used in Const 1963, art 11, \u00a7 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\">Notably, 2011 PA 264 does nothing to change the member\u2019s salary or wages.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> With regard to overtime, 2011 PA 264 does not affect the availability of overtime, or the rate at which overtime is paid; it only affects how overtime factors into a member\u2019s pension formula.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Accordingly, because 2011 PA 264 does not affect \u201crates of compensation\u201d by requiring changes to wages or salaries, it does not implicate the commission\u2019s constitutional authority over classified civil servants\u2019 \u201crates of compensation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">B. \"CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">As an alternative to their argument that SERA pensions are \u201crates of compensation,\u201d plaintiffs allege that SERA pensions are \u201cconditions of employment.\u201d They further allege that, as a result, any legislative action in the field of pensions requires commission approval in order to be constitutional. Plaintiffs also appear to allege that SERA was itself an \u201cexercise\u201d of commission authority.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> For the limited purpose of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>case, we assume without deciding that a pension is a \u201cconditionQ of employment\u201d as used in \u00b6 4 of Const 1963, art 11, \u00a7 5. Furthermore, for the limited purpose of this case, we also assume without deciding that the commission\u2019s authority under Article 11, \u00a7 5 to \u201cregulate all conditions of employment\u201d includes the authority to establish, maintain, and amend a pension plan.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Regardless, we hold that the commission has no authority to prevent the Legislature from enacting 2011 PA 264 any more than it had authority to compel the enactment of SERA itself because either act would constitute an unconstitutional exercise of legislative authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">1. THE COMMISSION LACKS POWER TO ENACT OR REVISE LEGISLATION</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">\u201cThe powers of government are divided into three branches: legislative, executive and judicial.\u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Although the commission is constitutionally created, and its proper functions are therefore constitutionally in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>violable, the commission\u2019s authority is part of the executive branch power.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> The commission \u201cis vested with plenary powers in its sphere of authority.\u201d<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Just as \u201cany executive, legislative or judicial attempt at incursion into that \u2018sphere\u2019 would be unavailing,\u201d<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> the commission itself may not act outside the bounds of its authority.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> The Legislature\u2014responsible for creating 2011 PA 264\u2014and the commission are each constitutionally precluded from exercising the powers of the other: \u201cNo person exercising powers of one branch shall exercise powers properly belonging to another branch except as <em>expressly </em>provided in [the] constitution.\u201d<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">It scarcely bears repeating that the executive power cannot be used to enact actual statutes. That power is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>vested exclusively in the Legislature.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> Likewise, the commission cannot mandate certain appropriations relating to conditions of employment, because the appropriative power also resides in the Legislature.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> That said, it is true that the separation of powers doctrine does not rigidly confine all powers of a certain character to one branch or another. One branch of government may have authority of a character typically associated with another branch, as long as the Constitution \u201cexplicitly\u201d grants that authority.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> A compelling example in this context is Const 1963, art 11, \u00a7 5, \u00b6 7, which provides the commission with the express authority to increase rates of compensation. Such increased rates must be included within the budget submitted by the Governor and are subject only to the supermajority veto of the Legislature. This is a singular, if limited, nonlegislative power to allocate taxpayer funds. This explicitly granted power stands in contrast to the absence of such power with respect to regulating conditions of employment. Article 11, \u00a7 5 cannot bear an interpretation that the ratifiers allocated any legislative or appropriative authority to the commission to regulate \u201cconditions of employment.\u201d Whatever the bounds of the commission\u2019s authority to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>increase rates of compensation, the Constitution gives the commission no comparable power to expend taxpayer funds in connection with its power to \u201cregulate conditions of employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\">By the same logic, the commission has no explicit authority to require the Legislature to exercise its lawmaking power in the field of \u201cconditions of employment.\u201d Under plaintiffs\u2019 interpretation of the constitutional provision at issue, the commission\u2019s power in this area would be so limitless as to include the authority for it to dictate the nuances of statutory schemes. Plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the commission has such authority must fail. Instead, when the commission wishes to regulate \u201cconditions of employment,\u201d it must proceed within its own sphere, using its own constitutionally provided tools, which it typically does by promulgating and enforcing its rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">2. 2011 PA 264 DOES NOT VIOLATE THE COMMISSION\u2019S CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">Based on the foregoing, we hold that SERA could not have been, and thus is not, a product that the commission could have created by exercising its proper constitutional authority. These principles are equally relevant in considering whether the <em>Legislature </em>has overstepped its bounds and intruded into the sphere of the commission\u2019s constitutional responsibility. Unlike the federal Constitution, our Constitution is \u201cnot a grant of power to the Legislature, but is a limitation upon its powers.\u201d<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> Therefore, the legislative authority of the state \u201ccan do anything which it is not prohibited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>from doing by the people through the Constitution of the State or the United States.\u201d<footnotemark>44</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">The commission has plenary, exclusive authority to \u201cregulate all conditions of employment <em>in the classified service.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>45</em></footnotemark><em> </em>As mentioned earlier, we assume without deciding that pensions are such \u201cconditions of employment\u201d and that the commission\u2019s authority under Article 11, \u00a7 5 to \u201cregulate all conditions of employment\u201d includes the authority to establish, maintain, and amend its own pension plan.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> We also assume without deciding that the commission\u2019s Article 11, \u00a7 5 authority to \u201cregulate all conditions of employment\u201d is exclusive and not subject to the Legislature\u2019s authority in Article 4, \u00a7 1 to exercise \u201c[t]he legislative power of the State of Michigan\u201d or its authority in Article 4, \u00a7 49 to \u201cenact laws relative to . . . conditions of employment.\u201d If that is the case, then SERA in its entirety is a legislative intrusion into the commission\u2019s sphere of authority to \u201cregulate all conditions of employment,\u201d by virtue of the fact that it dictates an element of a condition of employment.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> However, it is important to note that, in amending SERA by enacting 2011 PA 264, the Legislature has no more encroached upon the commission\u2019s authority to regulate pensions than it had before the amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>When confronted with a violation of the separation of powers, this Court has noted that it is permissible for one branch to acquiesce in the intrusion of another and thus avoid a constitutional conflict.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> Here, the commission acquiesced in the Legislature\u2019s presumed violation of the separation of powers when it made SERA applicable to civil servants in Rule 5-13, which provides that \u201c[a] classified employee is eligible for retirement benefits <em>as provided by law.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>49</em></footnotemark><em> </em>And Rule 5-13, last amended effective March 18, 2001, was in place when the Legislature enacted 2011 PA 246.

But that prior version of the law no longer exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">We merely hold that the commission may adopt rules that acquiesce in a statute that allegedly intrudes on its sphere of authority, as it has here. What plaintiffs seek in this appeal appears to be beyond the power of the commission. The commission cannot decline to acquiesce by directing the Legislature to \u201crevive\u201d an act that no longer exists. And what the commission cannot constitutionally do directly, it cannot, through surrogates or otherwise, accomplish indirectly by resort to the judiciary.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">V.

Likewise, when the commission acquiesces in the application of SERA to employees in the classified civil service, the presumed infringement of 2011 PA 264 presents no constitutional problem. The commission\u2019s authority to regulate does not permit the commission to enact, amend, or maintain the laws of this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-3\">We reverse the Court of Appeals and remand to the Court of Claims for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b565-4\">Markman, ZAHRA, and VIVIANO, JJ., concurred with YOUNG, C.J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b545-12\"> MCL 38.1 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b546-10\"> For a discussion of the motivations behind the creation of the state civil service, see, e.g., <em>Council No 11, AFSCME v Civil Serv Comm, </em>408 Mich 385, 397-401; 292 NW2d 442 (1980).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b547-7\"> Civ Serv R XXXVIII (1941) (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b548-9\"> The Governor\u2019s letter to the commission\u2019s state personnel director, dated February 18, 1943, acknowledged receipt of the commission\u2019s proposed retirement plan on February 1, 1943, and noted that he was assigning someone to review the submissions who would communicate with the commission at a future date.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b548-10\"> House Bill 177 was dated February 15, 1943.

Rather than \u201cassuming\u201d for purposes of this case that employees\u2019 pensions are \u201cconditions of employment\u201d within the meaning of Article 11, \u00a7 5, as the majority does, I would address that very issue as necessary to the question on which this Court specifically granted leave.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because pensions are not \u201cconditions of employment\u201d within the meaning of Article 11, \u00a7 5, I would hold that SERA and the specific provisions challenged therein\u2014namely, MCL 38.35a, MCL 38.50a, and MCL 38. le\u2014are not conditions of employment and therefore do not implicate the commission\u2019s authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">In 1943, the Legislature enacted SERA, establishing retirement benefits for state employees and conferring on the commission various powers and duties in implementing the system of retirement benefits.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In the 72 years that SERA has been in existence, the Legislature has often amended it to affect state employee pensions, and 2011 PA 264 is no exception.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Specifically, under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>MCL 38.50a(l) and (2), members currently enrolled in the state pension plan can elect to remain in that plan, but only by contributing \u201can amount equal to 4% of his or her compensation\u201d until termination or until reaching his or her attainment date, if the latter was designated by the employee.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> If an existing member in the state pension plan chooses <em>not </em>to make those 4% contributions, that member makes the irrevocable election to retain his or her existing accumulated contributions to the pension plan but, going forward, will receive credit for future service and compensation only through the defined contribution plan.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\">In granting leave to appeal, we specifically asked the parties whether 2011 PA 264 implicates the commission\u2019s authority under Article 11, \u00a7 5, which, in part, expressly authorizes the commission to \u201cregulate all conditions of employment in the classified service.\u201d It is beyond dispute that the challenged provisions of 2011 PA 264 concern amendments to the state employee pension system. The issue confronting this Court is whether these amendments alter a \u201ccondition of employment\u201d within the meaning of Article 11, \u00a7 5 and, therefore, invade the commission\u2019s constitutional au<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>thority. Rather than avoiding this constitutional issue, I would squarely address this question and, in doing so, would hold that these provisions do not implicate the commission\u2019s authority under Article 11, \u00a7 5 because a pension, by definition, is not a <em>condition of employment </em>but rather an <em>accrual of future financial benefits.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">The text of Article 11, \u00a7 5 suggests that the phrase \u201cconditions of employment\u201d is not without restriction. Indeed, the commission\u2019s general authority to \u201cregulate all conditions of employment\u201d is placed at the end of a list of specifically delineated powers: to \u201cclassify all positions in the classified service according to their respective duties and responsibilities,\u201d to \u201capprove or disapprove disbursements for all personal services,\u201d to \u201cdetermine by competitive examination and performance exclusively on the basis of merit, efficiency and fitness the qualifications of all candidates for positions in the classified service,\u201d and to \u201cmake rules and regulations covering all personnel transactions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">This Court has explained that the commission has the authority \u201cto regulate employment-related activity involving internal matters such as job specifications, compensation, grievance procedures, discipline, collective bargaining and job performance,\u201d but not activity that is not related to employment.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> If \u201cconditions of employment\u201d were interpreted, as plaintiffs and the Court of Appeals contend, as a broad catchall intended to prevent the Legislature from regulating any and all terms of employment involving classified state employees, it would violate the doctrine of <em>ejusdem generis, </em>under which general terms are restricted to include <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>only items that are \u201cof the same kind, class, character, or nature as those specifically enumerated.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">Instead, because the specific powers articulated in Article 11, \u00a7 5 are limited to the commission\u2019s authority over internal matters such as professional qualifications and expectations, compensation, job performance, and hiring and firing decisions, only a narrower concept of \u201cconditions of employment\u201d delineates the limited category of issues within the commission\u2019s exclusive control.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Notably absent from those categories is the authority to regulate pensions or retirement benefits. Furthermore, if the phrase \u201cconditions of employment\u201d were given a broader meaning, it would necessarily include those powers defined in specific terms, rendering that language superfluous.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">The history behind the grant of authority in Article 11, \u00a7 5 is also instructive. Clearly, the voters intended to provide the commission with the authority to \u201cregulate all conditions of employment for employees in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>classified service\u201d when they approved the amendment of Const 1908, art 6, \u00a7 22 in 1940. By retaining this very same language in the 1963 Constitution, the ratifiers of Article 11, \u00a7 5 expressed their intent that the commission continue to have such authority.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> And because, by that point, SERA had been in effect for 20 years, the Legislature had amended it several times in the interim, and many of those amendments specifically affected pensions, the Legislature plainly did not regard the ratification of Article 6, \u00a7 22 as prohibiting its authority to enact and amend SERA.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Still, had the drafters of the 1963 Constitution believed SERA to be an unconstitutional usurpation of the commission\u2019s authority, they easily could have clarified that by conferring additional powers on the commission pursuant to Article 11, \u00a7 5, or by limiting the Legislature\u2019s powers under Article 4.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b571-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>Furthermore, Article 11, \u00a7 5 does not contemplate the commission\u2019s authority to regulate \u201cconditions of employment\u201d in a vacuum. For instance, the convention comment to Article 11, \u00a7 5 indicates that in connection with the proposed 1963 Constitution, \u201c[o]f special interest to civil service personnel is the provision in [Article 9, \u00a7 24], . . . which specifies that pension plans and retirement systems of the state shall be contractual obligations \u2018which shall not be diminished or impaired.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Indeed, this Court recognized that Article 9, \u00a7 24 specifically prohibits legislative impairment of \u201caccrued financial benefits,\u201d though the Legislature \u201cmay properly attach new conditions for earning financial benefits which have not yet accrued.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Similarly, by adopting Article 9, \u00a7 24, the ratifiers conveyed their intent that it would be the employer itself\u2014and <em>not </em>the commission\u2014who could <em>prospectively </em>change pension benefits.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\">In examining 2011 PA 264, it is important to note that MCL 38.35a, MCL 38.50a, and MCL 38.le do nothing to implicate Article 9, \u00a7 24 because they do not impair or diminish pension members\u2019 already accrued pension benefits; rather, they only affect the accrual of <em>future </em>pension benefits. Moreover, because pension proceeds are payable to the member <em>upon </em>his or her completion of service, calculation of those benefits does not impose <em>conditions of </em>employment, but creates <em>benefits following </em>employment.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Clearly, then, that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>Legislature offered pension members the opportunity to remain in the defined benefit pension plan (subject to the 4% contribution requirement) demonstrates that the Legislature did not regulate a condition of employment but merely provided members the additional benefit option of membership in the defined contribution plan, which they were free to accept or decline. That 2011 PA 264 presents members with a retirement allowance election makes clear that continued employment is not conditioned on paying the 4% contribution.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In other words, because enrolling in the now-contributory defined benefit pension plan does not alter a pension member\u2019s existing employment circumstances but rather affects a benefit subsequent to employment, the challenged provisions of 2011 PA 264 do not attempt to regulate a condition of employment and, therefore, do not invade the commission\u2019s sphere of authority under Article 11, \u00a7 5.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>As the majority recognizes, the commission\u2019s regulatory authority under Article 11, \u00a7 5 does not empower the commission to enact, amend, or revise the laws of this state because it is not a legislative body.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> It necessarily follows, then, that the commission lacks the authority to enact, prevent, or otherwise dictate legislation as it relates to pensions. Even the commission implicitly acknowledges these limitations because it has never attempted to enact a separate retirement system,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> nor has it adopted any separate rules regulating pensions.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> To the contrary, the commission acknowledges only an advisory role in the administration of SERA.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark>1 therefore disagree with the majority to the extent that it assumes that the terms of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>pension plan are conditions of employment. Rather, because the terms of pension plans are not conditions of employment, they do not implicate Article 11, \u00a7 5 in the first instance. Accordingly, I would conclude that 2011 PA 264 does not intrude into the commission\u2019s sphere of authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">Consistent with this analysis, I concur in the majority\u2019s decision to reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals and remand this case to the Court of Claims. Nevertheless, I respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s assumption that a pension is a condition of employment and instead would reach the question this Court posed\u2014and the parties briefed\u2014and uphold 2011 PA 264 because it does not regulate a \u201ccondition of employment\u201d within the meaning of Article 11, \u00a7 5.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b565-6\"> MCL 38.1 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b566-5\"> <em>Mich Coalition of State Employee Unions v Michigan, </em>495 Mich 921 (2014).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b566-6\"> 1943 PA 240.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b566-7\"> See, e.g., 1984 PA 3 (providing pension incentives to eligible state employees in exchange for early retirement); 1987 PA 57 (changing the formula for calculating future pensions by using a three-year average instead of the former five-year average); 1991 PA 62 (affecting the computation of members\u2019 retirement allowance depending on the age of retirement and providing members the right to elect a specified retirement option); 1992 PA 64 (providing pension incentives for early retirement); 1993 PA 195 (permitting members to increase their pensions by purchasing service credit); 1996 PA 487 (closing the pension fund for newly hired state employees, creating a new contribution plan for those employees, and providing that all employees hired on or after March 31, 1997, are \u201cqualified participants\u201d in a defined contribution plan in which the state contributes an amount equal to 4% of the participant\u2019s compensation and will match up to an additional 3% of the participant\u2019s contributions, and eliminating any fixed retirement allow<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>ance provided by the state); 1998 PA 205 (permitting members to increase their pensions by purchasing service credit); 2002 PA 93 (providing for nonduty disability retirement benefits); 2002 PA 743 (providing pension incentives for early retirement); and 2010 PA 185 (providing pension incentives for individuals retiring between November 1, 2010, and January 1, 2011).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b567-9\"> MCL 38.35a.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b567-10\"> MCL 38.50a(4). 2011 PA 264 also amended MCL 38.le to change the calculation for overtime earnings.

Similarly, Justice BERNSTEIN fails to explain how the commission\u2019s purported authority to regulate pensions derives from its authority to regulate certain off-duty political activity. If anything, that this Court has understood the commission\u2019s sphere of authority to \u201cdelimito its rule-making power and confined its jurisdiction over the political activity of classified personnel <em>to on-the-job behavior related to job performance,\u201d Council No 11, </em>408 Mich at 408 (emphasis added), only reinforces a more limited interpretation of the powers identified under Article 11, \u00a7 5.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b570-6\"> While Justice BERNSTEIN appears to agree with this proposition, he nevertheless concludes that this \u201csupposed intention shines no light on whether the commission can properly challenge legislative incursion into its sphere of authority.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 355.

As support for this assertion, Justice Bernstein explains that while grievance procedures likely do not occur as part of an employee\u2019s day-to-day employment routine, the commission nevertheless has plenary authority to regulate such matters, thus providing employees with expected future procedures. Regardless of how routine grievance procedures might be, regulating grievance procedures is essential to an employee\u2019s <em>current </em>employment conditions, even if that employee does not require the use of those procedures during his or her period of employment.

See Const 1963, art 4, \u00a7 1 (\u201cThe legislative power of the State of Michigan is vested in a senate and a house of representatives.\u201d); <em>46th Circuit Trial Court v Crawford Co, </em>476 Mich 131, 141; 719 NW2d 553 (2006) (opinion by MARKMAN, J.) (stating that \u201cthe power to tax and to appropriate for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>specific purposes\u201d is a \u201cfundamental aspect\u201d of legislative power); Const 1963, art 3, \u00a7 2 (\u201cNo person exercising powers of one branch shall exercise powers properly belonging to another branch except as expressly provided in [the] constitution.\u201d)- Stated differently, I believe the question of how the commission\u2019s power to regulate pensions as a \u201ccondition of employment\u201d within the civil service can be reconciled with the Legislature\u2019s exclusive authority to make appropriations to be a difficult one. I write separately because while the majority\u2019s explanation of the commission\u2019s historic acquiescence in the legislature\u2019s encroachment might be correct, given that it is not essential to the majority\u2019s holding and was not explored by the parties, I would refrain from commenting on it. Although the majority may not believe that its discussion of this point drives any of its analysis, I do not believe its opinion makes that sufficiently clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\">Despite the significance of this separation of powers question, I ultimately agree with the majority that it is not a question we should reach just yet. Because the commission, as the affected constitutional actor, is not a party to this lawsuit, has not otherwise officially objected to the legislature\u2019s action, and appears by its own official pronouncement, Civ Serv R 5-13, to have acceded to the legislation, I believe we should refrain from deciding the separation of powers question that the plaintiffs have asserted on the commission\u2019s behalf for today. But since Rule 5-13 is all we need to decide this case, I would not consider what import, if any, to assign the commission\u2019s historical \u201cacquiescence\u201d in the broader context.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">If, in the future, the commission changes its position and objects to the Legislature\u2019s enactment of 2011 PA 264, we will need to confront the question of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>commission\u2019s constitutional authority and the effect of its historical accommodation of the legislative enactments embodied in the State Employees\u2019 Retirement Act, MCL 38.1 <em>et seq. </em>In my view, those questions should be evaluated once there is a genuine dispute between the commission and the Legislature, once the affected parties have had sufficient opportunity to answer them, and after this Court has taken time to carefully evaluate them with the benefit of that input. For now, I believe the majority is ultimately correct to postpone that difficult constitutional question for another day.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b576-6\">BERNSTEIN, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AOkT\">(dissenting). Our Constitution provides that the Civil Service Commission has plenary authority to \u201cregulate all conditions of employment.\u201d Const 1963, art 11, \u00a7 5. The majority concludes that the 2011 amendments to the State Employees\u2019 Retirement Act (SERA), MCL 38.1 <em>et seq., </em>do not infringe the commission\u2019s constitutional grant of authority where the commission has previously acquiesced to SERA. Put simply, the majority holds that to reject only those amendments found in 2011 PA 264, and not SERA in its entirety, would constitute a line-item veto on the part of the commission and that the separation of powers doctrine dictates that an executive body cannot exercise legislative powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">As an initial matter, I agree with the majority that a pension is a \u201ccondition 0 of employment\u201d as that phrase is used in Const 1963, art 11, \u00a7 5, and that the commission\u2019s authority under that provision includes the authority to establish, maintain, and amend a pension plan.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, I disagree that the commission\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>historical practice towards SERA constitutes executive acquiescence that would waive its right to object to an unconstitutional legislative infringement. Moreover, because 2011 PA 264 is an unconstitutional infringement of the commission\u2019s constitutional grant of <em>plenary </em>authority, rejection of the amendments constitutes a recognition of the amendments\u2019 unconstitutional nature and not a legislative action akin to a line-item veto. I would therefore affirm the Court of Appeals judgment and hold that the challenged provisions of 2011 PA 264 are unconstitutional as applied to employees in the classified civil service.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-3\">I. SEPARATION OF POWERS</p>\n<p id=\"b577-4\">I agree with the majority that the separation of powers doctrine generally dictates that an executive body like the commission does not have the authority to either enact statutes or appropriate funds.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Save for the express grant of authority that allows the commission to increase rates of compensation for employees in the classified civil service, the commission does not otherwise have the power to appropriate funds in the pursuit of regulating conditions of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">The majority thus reasons that the commission lacks the authority to require the Legislature to enact statutes as the commission sees fit. I agree with the majority that the commission\u2019s constitutional grant of authority does not go so far as to allow the commission to \u201cdictate [to the Legislature] the nuances of statutory schemes,\u201d even when those statutory schemes touch upon the commission\u2019s sphere of authority (\u201cconditions of employment\u201d). <em>Ante </em>at 331. However, there is a meaningful difference between an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>assertion that the commission has the power to <em>dictate </em>what the Legislature enacts into law and an assertion that the commission is empowered to <em>object </em>to a legislative incursion into the commission\u2019s sphere of authority. The former is a usurpation of legislative powers, which the separation of powers doctrine forbids; the latter is merely a recognition that because the commission\u2019s \u201cgrant of power is from the Constitution, any executive, legislative or judicial attempt at incursion into that \u2018sphere\u2019 would be unavailing.\u201d <em>Council No 11, AFSCME v Civil Serv Comm, </em>408 Mich 385, 408; 292 NW2d 442 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">The majority assumes without deciding that the commission has a constitutional grant of authority to establish, maintain, and amend a pension plan. When the Legislature interferes with this plenary grant of authority, the commission may object to this improper interference. In so doing, the commission does not seek to exercise the legislative power to enact, amend, or veto laws. Instead, the commission\u2019s rejection of the challenged provisions in 2011 PA 264 is better characterized as an objection to the <em>Legislature\u2019s </em>failure to respect the separation of powers doctrine. If one accepts that a pension is a condition of employment over which the commission has plenary authority, the Legislature is the entity that intrudes upon another branch of government by making laws that attempt to govern what lies in the commission\u2019s sphere. An objection to unconstitutional action does not equate to the exercise of legislative authority. The commission\u2019s objection is not a line-item veto of legislative action that would itself constitute a violation of the separation of powers doctrine, but is instead better understood as a declaration that the legislative action is a violation of the separation of powers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>doctrine and is therefore unconstitutional at the outset.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\">II. EXECUTIVE ACQUIESCENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">The majority also considers whether the Legislature intruded into the sphere of the commission\u2019s authority in enacting the challenged provisions of 2011 PA 264. Again, in assuming without deciding that pensions are conditions of employment over which the commission has plenary authority, the majority concludes that SERA itself is an intrusion into the commission\u2019s authority and that the challenged provisions are more of the same. Faced with the Legislature\u2019s violation of the separation of powers, the majority turns to the idea of executive acquiescence, concluding that the commission acquiesced to \u201cthe Legislature\u2019s presumed violation of the separation of powers when it made SERA applicable to civil servants[.]\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 333. In support of this claim, the majority cites Civ Serv R 5-13, which provides that \u201c[a] classified employee is eligible for retirement benefits as provided by law.\u201d Because the law regarding retirement benefits now encompasses the challenged provisions enacted in 2011 PA 264, the majority concludes that the commission cannot now revoke its acquiescence without itself violating the separation of powers doctrine by directing the Legislature to strike these provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">In support of the idea of executive acquiescence, the majority relies on a series of cases that considered the concept of <em>judicial </em>acquiescence. This line of cases dealt with judicial acquiescence to legislative action. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number><em>Perin v Peuler, </em>373 Mich 531, 541; 130 NW2d 4 (1964), this Court first defined the scope of judicial rulemaking by stating that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-6\">[t]he function of enacting and amending judicial rules of practice and procedure has been committed exclusively to this Court (Const 1908, art 7, \u00a7 5; Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 5); a function with which the legislature may not meddle or interfere save as the Court may acquiesce and adopt for retention at judicial will.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">However, this Court recognized a limit to this general grant of constitutional authority: \u201c[A]s is evident from the plain language of [Const 1963] art 6, \u00a7 5, this Court\u2019s constitutional rule-making authority extends <em>only </em>to matters of practice and procedure.\u201d <em>McDougall v </em>Schanz, 461 Mich 15, 27; 597 NW2d 148 (1999). In distinguishing between substantive rules and rules of practice and procedure, the <em>McDougall </em>Court found that the <em>Perin </em>Court had \u201coverstated the reach of our rule-making authority,\u201d explaining that the distinction between rules of substance and procedure \u201cis one that was not only advocated by recognized scholars contemporaneously with the development and passage of our 1963 Constitution, but one that. . . the drafters contemplated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 29-30.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-8\">The <em>McDougall </em>majority thus stands for the proposition that this Court\u2019s constitutional grant of authority to promulgate rules is not a grant of <em>plenary </em>authority. Although this Court has \u201cexclusive rule-making authority in matters of practice and procedure,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 26, the <em>McDougall </em>majority was primarily concerned with making clear that this Court does not have such authority with regard to <em>substantive </em>rules. In contrast, there is no such limitation on the commission\u2019s authority over conditions of employment in either the plain language of the Constitution or in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>minds of the ratifiers, whose clear intent was to remove the classified civil service from legislative interference.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Moreover, <em>McDougall </em>is inapplicable to the question of even <em>judicial </em>acquiescence, let alone executive, as this Court recognized that it \u201cis not authorized to enact. . . rules that establish, abrogate, or modify the substantive law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 27. The holding in <em>McDou-gall </em>thus concerned whether the Legislature had enacted a substantive or a procedural rule; in other words, because this Court does not have the constitutional authority to promulgate substantive rules, there is no question of judicial acquiescence where the Court attempts to act outside of the bounds of its sphere of authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\">In contrast to the situation presented in <em>McDougall, </em>the commission\u2019s authority over conditions of employment is plenary; any legislative incursion into this sphere is itself a violation of the separation of powers doctrine. The commission\u2019s involvement, however minimal, in the enactment of SERA and amendments thereafter speaks nothing to this underlying constitutional principle.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">The majority finally relies on <em>Judicial Attorneys Ass\u2019n v Michigan, </em>459 Mich 291; 586 NW2d 894 (1998). In that case, this Court held that statutory provisions that designated counties as the employers of judicial employees violated the separation of powers doctrine. <em>Id. </em>at 302-303. In so holding, this Court acknowledged that practical necessity (in particular, the lack of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>ability to appropriate funds) drove the judiciary to reach certain accommodations with the Legislature. <em>Id. </em>However, this Court specifically found that this prior acquiescence could <em>not </em>\u201cbe used as an excuse to diminish the judiciary\u2019s essential authority over its own personnel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 303.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Judicial Attorneys Ass\u2019n </em>thus stands for the proposition that prior acquiescence alone, especially in the face of practical considerations such as the lack of appropriation authority, does not waive one branch\u2019s right to contest the intrusion of another branch in the future.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">The majority holds that the commission \u201cmay adopt rules [like Civ Serv R 5-13] that acquiesce in a statute that allegedly intrudes on its sphere of authority, as it has here.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 334. This is in line with the observation in <em>Judicial Attorneys Ass\u2019n </em>that one branch may decide, for practical reasons, to acquiesce to another branch\u2019s involvement. See <em>Judicial Attorneys Ass\u2019n, </em>459 Mich at 304 (\u201cSeparation of powers does not preclude what has proven to be the rule rather than the exception in the operation of Michigan\u2019s trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>courts: cooperation, communication, and accommodation between trial courts and their funding units in their exercise of shared responsibility to the public. The philosophical underpinnings of the separation of powers doctrine, Michigan case law, and common sense all point toward such cooperation.\u201d). However, \u201c[t]he constitutionality of an act must rest on the provisions of the act itself, and not on the compensating actions of those affected by the act.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b583-4\">Put simply\u2014one branch\u2019s acquiescence, however affirmative, cannot render an unconstitutional act constitutional.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> That the commission has historically worked to reach an accommodation with the Legislature in the enactment and subsequent amendments of SERA, to facilitate cooperation among different branches of government does not strip it of the ability to object to the challenged provisions of 2011 PA 264. Mere acquiescence <em>cannot </em>cure a violation of the separation of powers doctrine. If pensions do fall within the commission\u2019s sphere of authority, the commission cannot have the ability to waive their <em>constitutional grant of plenary authority.</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Although the majority suggests that the commission would itself violate the separation of powers doctrine by directing the Legislature to exercise its legislative powers in striking the chal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>lenged provisions of 2011 PA 264, I respectfully disagree. Instead, I would conclude that plaintiffs are merely requesting that we strike the unconstitutional provisions of the amended SERA, not directing the Legislature to revive a \u201cprior version of the law [that] no longer exists.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 334.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">Because the challenged provisions of 2011 PA 264 constitute violations of the separation of powers doctrine, I would hold that they are not properly part of SERA.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">III. CONDITION OF EMPLOYMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b584-8\">While the majority assumes without deciding that pensions are a condition of employment as that phrase is understood in Const 1963, art 11, \u00a7 5, Justice KELLY would uphold 2011 PA 264 on the basis that it does not regulate conditions of employment. I respectfully disagree with Justice Kelly\u2019s conclusion. I believe that pensions are a condition of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-9\">Justice KELLY argues that the plain language of the Constitution indicates that the phrase \u201cconditions of employment\u201d was not intended as a broad catchall, and is instead limited to internal matters. However, I believe this reading fails to account for this Court\u2019s prior pronouncement that the commission has the authority \u201cto regulate employment-related activity involving internal matters <em>such as </em>job specifications, compensation, grievance procedures, discipline, collective bargaining and job performance, <em>including </em>the power to prohibit activity during working hours which is found to interfere with satisfactory job perfor-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>manee.\u201d <em>Council No 11, </em>408 Mich at 406-407 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Certainly a broad definition of the phrase \u201cconditions of employment\u201d need be employed in order to tie together such disparate concepts as disciplinary procedures and collective bargaining. Furthermore, this Court continued by stating that \u201cit is within contemplation that off-duty political involvement may adversely affect a classified employee\u2019s performance at work. If and when it does, the commission is empowered to deal with such circumstances on a case-by-case basis.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 407. A definition that embraces off-duty political involvement is a broad one that can also encompass pensions, which are arguably easier to square away as employment-related activity involving internal matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-4\">Justice KELLY also notes that, by the time the 1963 Constitution was ratified, SERA had been in effect for 20 years; by keeping the same grant of authority found in the 1908 Constitution, the ratifiers thus did not intend to eliminate the Legislature\u2019s authority to enact and amend SERA. In support of this proposition, Justice Kelly cites a comment that suggests the ratifiers intended that pension plans not be diminished or impaired. But as stated earlier, this supposed intention shines no light on whether the . commission can properly challenge legislative incursion into its sphere of authority. I agree that the ratifiers did not intend to proscribe the Legislature\u2019s ability to enact or amend SERA, but this did not change the underlying presumption that the commission maintained the constitutional authority to regulate pensions; that the commission did not challenge the enactment or amendment of SERA prior to the ratification of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>1963 Constitution only indicates that it did not believe that the Legislature had yet overstepped its bounds.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">Justice KELLY finally notes that the challenged provisions of 2011 PA 264 only affect the accrual of future pension benefits; because such benefits are only payable to individuals upon leaving the classified civil service, pension benefits <em>follow </em>employment, and are not conditions <em>of </em>employment. The constitutional difference wrought by this change in preposition appears to hang on two observations: first, that pension benefits are payable in the future, and second, that a certain retirement election allowance is not required for continued employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">As to the first, there is nothing in the plain language of the Constitution that suggests that a \u201ccondition of employment\u201d is limited in scope to those internal matters that are present during a particular time period. This Court has previously stated that grievance procedures are unquestionably within the commission\u2019s grant of authority, <em>Council No 11, </em>408 Mich at 406, and one hopes that grievance procedures are not part of everyday reality for most employees in the classified civil service. Indeed, the ability to plan ahead for expected future outcomes is part and parcel of the internal, employment-related activity that constitutes conditions <em>of </em>employment. See <em>Wescott v Civil Serv Comm, </em>298 Mich App 158, 164; 825 NW2d 674 (2012) (holding that the commission does not need to consider disability decisions rendered by other state agencies in making a determination on a request for long-term <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>disability benefits); <em>Mich State Employees Ass\u2019n v Dep\u2019t of Mental Health, </em>421 Mich 152, 163-164; 365 NW2d 93 (1984) (holding that it is the constitutional duty of the commission to establish discharge procedures in accordance with due process). The very motivation for the creation of the classified civil service points to the same conclusion: a merit-based system was memorialized in our Constitution out of a fear of a patronage system, which could result in the <em>future </em>termination of otherwise qualified employees upon a change in political fortune. See <em>Mich State Employees Ass\u2019n, </em>421 Mich at 159-160. As to the second, a condition of employment is not defined by whether a classified civil service employee is required to behave a certain way in order to maintain employment. This definition is not broad enough to encompass \u201cjob specifications, compensation, grievance procedures, discipline, collective bargaining and job performance,\u201d <em>Council No </em>11, 408 Mich at 406, which are all unquestionably part of the commission\u2019s grant of plenary authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-4\">Because I conclude that pensions are a condition of employment under Const 1963, art 11, \u00a75,1 would hold that the challenged provisions of 2011 PA 264 improperly intrude on the commission\u2019s constitutional grant of plenary authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">I would hold that pensions fall under the commission\u2019s plenary authority over conditions of employment under Const 1963, art 11, \u00a7 5. Because the commission has not acquiesced to the Legislature\u2019s intrusion into its constitutional sphere of authority, I would hold that the challenged provisions of 2011 PA 264 constitute a violation of the separation of powers doctrine. Accordingly, I would affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b576-8\"> Although the majority assumes this without deciding, Justice Kelly would hold that pensions are not conditions of employment under Const 1963, art 11, \u00a7 5.
