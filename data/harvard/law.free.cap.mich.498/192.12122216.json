But this constitutionally protected reservation of power by the people comes with a cost. The lack of procedural scrutiny in the initiative process leaves the process susceptible to the creation of inconsistent or unclear laws that may be difficult to interpret and harmonize. The MMMA is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>such a law. While the MMMA has been the law in Michigan for just under seven years, this Court has been called on to give meaning to the MMMA in nine different cases.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The many inconsistencies in the law have caused confusion for medical marijuana caregivers and patients, law enforcement, attorneys, and judges, and have consumed valuable public and private resources to interpret and apply it. This confusion mainly stems from the immunity, MCL 333.26424 (\u00a7 4), and the affirmative defense, MCL 333.26428 (\u00a7 8), provisions of the MMMA. We granted leave in <em>People v </em>Hartwick<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and <em>People v </em>Tuttle<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> to once again consider <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>the meaning and application of these two very important sections of the MMMA.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b431-3\">For the reasons fully explained in this opinion regarding \u00a7 4, we hold:</p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\">(1) entitlement to \u00a7 4 immunity is a question of law to be decided by the trial court before trial;</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">(2) the trial court must resolve factual disputes relating to \u00a7 4 immunity, and such factual findings are reviewed on appeal for clear error;</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">(3) the trial court\u2019s legal determinations under the MMMA are reviewed de novo on appeal;</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">(4) a defendant may claim immunity under \u00a7 4 for each charged offense if the defendant shows by a preponderance of the evidence that, at the time of the charged offense, the defendant</p>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">(i) possessed a valid registry identification card,</p>\n<p id=\"b431-9\">(ii) complied with the requisite volume limitations of \u00a7 4(a) and \u00a7 4(b),</p>\n<p id=\"b431-10\">(iii) stored any marijuana plants in an enclosed, locked facility, and</p>\n<p id=\"b431-11\">(iv) was engaged in the medical use of marijuana;</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>(5) the burden of proving \u00a7 4 immunity is separate and distinct for each charged offense;</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">(6) a marijuana transaction by a registered qualifying patient or a registered primary caregiver that is not in conformity with the MMMAdoes not per se taint all aspects of the registered qualifying patient\u2019s or registered primary caregiver\u2019s marijuana-related conduct;</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">(7) a defendant is entitled to a presumption under \u00a7 4(d) that he or she was engaged in the medical use of marijuana if the defendant has shown by a preponderance of the evidence that, at the time of the charged offense, the defendant</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">(i) possessed a valid registry identification card, and</p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">(ii) complied with the requisite volume limitations of \u00a7 4(a) and \u00a7 4(b);<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b432-9\">(8) the prosecution may rebut the \u00a7 4(d) presumption that the defendant was engaged in the medical use of marijuana by presenting evidence that the defendant\u2019s conduct was not for the purpose of alleviating the registered qualifying patient\u2019s debilitating medical condition;</p>\n<p id=\"b432-10\">(9) non-MMMA-compliant conduct may rebut the \u00a7 4(d) presumption of medical use for otherwise MMMA-compliant conduct if a nexus exists between the non-MMMA-compliant conduct and the otherwise MMMA-compliant conduct;</p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>(10) if the prosecution rebuts the \u00a7 4(d) presumption of the medical use of marijuana, the defendant may still establish, on a charge-by-charge basis, that the conduct underlying a particular charge was for the medical use of marijuana; and</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">(11) the trial court must ultimately weigh the evidence to determine if the defendant has met the requisite burden of proof as to all elements of \u00a7 4 immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">Regarding \u00a7 8, we hold:</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">(1) a defendant must present prima facie evidence of each element of \u00a7 8(a) in order to be entitled to present a \u00a7 8 affirmative defense to a fact-finder;</p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">(2) if the defendant meets this burden, then the defendant must prove each element of \u00a7 8(a) by a preponderance of the evidence; and</p>\n<p id=\"b433-9\">(3) a valid registry identification card does not establish any presumption under \u00a7 8.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b433-10\">For the reasons stated in this opinion, and in accordance with the conclusions of law described above, we affirm in part and reverse in part the November 19, 2013 judgment of the Court of Appeals in <em>People v </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number><em>Hartwick.</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark><em> </em>We further remand <em>Hartwick </em>to the trial court for an evidentiary hearing regarding Hartwick\u2019s entitlement to immunity under \u00a7 4. In <em>People v Tuttle, </em>we affirm in part and reverse in part the January 30, 2014 judgment of the Court of Appeals.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We also remand <em>Tuttle </em>to the trial court for an evidentiary hearing regarding Tuttle\u2019s entitlement to immunity under \u00a7 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-3\">I. STATEMENT OF FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"Aab\">A. <em>PEOPLE v HARTWICK</em></p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">In late 2011, police officers in Oakland County received a tip regarding a marijuana growing operation at Hartwick\u2019s home. Law enforcement officers confronted Hartwick, who admitted growing marijuana, but stated he was in compliance with the MMMA. After consenting to a search of his home, Hartwick led the police officers to a bedroom containing dozens of marijuana plants in varying sizes.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The police officers also found a total of 104.6 grams (approximately 3.69 ounces) of usable marijuana in the home.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">The Oakland County Prosecutor charged Hartwick with manufacturing 20 to 200 marijuana plants and possession with intent to deliver marijuana. Hartwick moved to dismiss those charges based on both the immunity (\u00a7 4) and the affirmative defense (\u00a7 8) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>provided in the MMMA. The trial court held an evi-dentiary hearing at which Hartwick was the only witness. Hartwick testified that he was a medical marijuana patient and his own caregiver,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and a connected<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> primary caregiver to five registered qualifying patients. He submitted into evidence the registry identification cards for himself and the five connected qualifying patients. Hartwick could not identify the debilitating conditions suffered by two of the qualifying patients statutorily connected to him. Further, Hartwick could not identify the certifying physician for any of the five connected qualifying patients.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">The trial court concluded that Hartwick was not entitled to \u00a7 4 immunity. The court reasoned that Hart-wick did not comply with the requirements of the MMMA because he did not know if the patients connected to him even had debilitating medical conditions.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>The trial court similarly denied Hartwick\u2019s motion to dismiss under \u00a7 8 and his motion in the alternative to present a \u00a7 8 affirmative defense to the jury. The court determined that Hartwick failed to present \u201ctestimony regarding a \u2018bona fide physician-patient relationship or a likelihood of receiving therapeutic or palliative benefit from the medical use of marijuana,\u2019 or any testimony on whether defendant possessed no more marijuana than reasonably necessary for medical use.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Thus, Hartwick failed to establish his entitlement to a \u00a7 8 affirmative defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">The Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court, rejecting Hartwick\u2019s contention \u201cthat his possession of a registry identification card automatically immunizes him from prosecution under \u00a7 4 and grants him a complete defense under \u00a7 8.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals focused on the \u201cprimary purpose\u201d of the MMMA, \u201cwhich is to ensure that any marijuana production and use permitted by the statute is medical in nature and only for treating a patient\u2019s debilitating medical condition.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">B. <em>PEOPLE v TUTTLE</em></p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">Tuttle was a registered qualifying patient and his own caregiver. He was also connected as a registered primary caregiver to at least one other registered qualifying patient.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> On three separate occasions in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>early 2012, Tattle sold marijuana to William Lalonde even though Tuttle was not formally connected to La-londe under the MMMA. In addition to arresting Tuttle for providing marijuana to Lalonde, the Oakland County Sheriffs Office searched Tuttle\u2019s home where they found 33 marijuana plants, 38 grams of marijuana (approximately 1.34 ounces), and several weapons locked in a gun safe. Tuttle was subsequently charged with multiple counts related to the possession, delivery, and manufacture of marijuana, as well as possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">Tuttle attempted to invoke the immunity provided under \u00a7 4 for Counts IV through VII relating to possession of the marijuana in his home. Tuttle argued that he possessed a valid registry identification card and complied with the volume and storage limitations of \u00a7 4(a) and \u00a7 4(b). The prosecution argued that Tuttle did not comply with the requirements of \u00a7 4 because Tuttle provided marijuana to Lalonde outside the parameters of the MMMA. According to the prosecution, these transactions (for which Tuttle was charged in Counts I through III) tainted all of Tuttle\u2019s marijuana-related activity. The trial court agreed and denied Tuttle\u2019s motion under \u00a7 4 for immunity and dismissal of the charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">Tuttle then raised the \u00a7 8 affirmative defense to Counts I through III. At an evidentiary hearing, Tuttle presented his registry identification card and the registry identification cards belonging to two allegedly connected qualifying patients: Michael Batke and Frank Colon. Lalonde, Batke, and Colon testified at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>Lalonde testified that he was a registered qualifying patient who met Tuttle through an internet site that purported to match medical marijuana patients with caregivers. Lalonde also testified that he told Tuttle he used marijuana to treat chronic pain. Batke testified that he was a registered qualifying patient and that Tuttle was properly connected to him under the MMMA as a registered primary caregiver. Batke also testified that he would call Tuttle every time he needed marijuana, and Tuttle provided Batke with approximately two ounces of marijuana a month. Lastly, Colon testified that he was a medical marijuana patient, that he had a debilitating medical condition,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> and that he utilized Tuttle as a primary caregiver. Colon stated he requested between one and two ounces of marijuana a week from Tuttle.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">After the evidentiary hearing, the trial court determined that Tuttle did not present prima facie evidence for each element of \u00a7 8(a). Specifically, the trial court determined that Tuttle failed to present any evidence that the medical marijuana users to whom Tuttle was connected had physicians who \u201ccompleted a full assessment of each patient\u2019s medical history and current medical condition\u201d as required by \u00a7 8(a)(1).<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The court also concluded that Tuttle failed to establish a question of fact regarding whether the quantity of marijuana he possessed was reasonable under \u00a7 8(a)(2).<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court and additionally concluded that Tuttle had not presented prima facie <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>evidence as to Tattle\u2019s own medical use of marijuana under \u00a7 8(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">Regarding \u00a7 4 immunity, the Court of Appeals concluded that providing marijuana to Lalonde tainted all of Tuttle\u2019s marijuana-related conduct thereby negating Tuttle\u2019s ability to invoke \u00a7 4 immunity for any charge. Regarding the affirmative defense available under \u00a7 8, the Court of Appeals concluded that Tuttle\u2019s registry identification card did not establish prima facie evidence of the required elements of \u00a7 8. The court also concluded that the testimony of Tuttle\u2019s patients was equally deficient in presenting prima facie evidence of those elements.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">The possession, manufacture, and delivery of marijuana are punishable criminal offenses under Michigan law.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Under the MMMA, though, \u201c[t]he medical use of marihuana is allowed under state law to the extent that it is carried out in accordance with the provisions of th[e] act.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The MMMA grants to persons in compliance with its provisions either immunity from, or an affirmative defense to, those marijuana-related violations of state law. In the cases before us, we must resolve questions surrounding the \u00a7 4 grant of immunity and the \u00a7 8 affirmative defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">A. STANDARD OP REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b439-9\">We review questions of statutory interpretation de novo.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The MMMA was passed into law by initiative. We must therefore determine the intent of the elector<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>ate in approving the MMMA, rather than the intent of the Legislature.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Our interpretation is ultimately drawn from the plain language of the statute, which provides \u201cthe most reliable evidence\u201d of the electors\u2019 intent.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> But as with other initiatives, we place \u201cspecial emphasis on the duty of judicial restraint.\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Particularly, we make no judgment as to the wisdom of the medical use of marijuana in Michigan. This state\u2019s electors have made that determination for us. To that end, we do not attempt to limit or extend the statute\u2019s words. We merely bring them meaning derived from the plain language of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-3\">B. SECTION 4 IMMUNITY</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">Section 4 grants broad immunity from criminal prosecution and civil penalties to \u201cqualifying patient [s]\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> and \u201cprimary caregiver[s].\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Subsection (a) specifically grants immunity to qualifying patients and states in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-5\">(a) A qualifying patient who has been issued and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>possesses a registry identification card/<footnotemark>33</footnotemark>1 shall not be subject to arrest, prosecution, or penalty in any manner ... for the medical use1<footnotemark>34</footnotemark>1 of marihuana in accordance with this act, provided that the qualifying patient possesses an amount of marihuana that does not exceed 2.5 ounces of usable marihuana, and, if the qualifying patient has not specified ... a primary caregiver ... , 12 marihuana plants kept in an enclosed, locked facility.1<footnotemark>35</footnotemark>1</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-3\">A registered qualifying patient, therefore, may possess up to 2.5 ounces of usable marijuana.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Additionally, a registered qualifying patient may possess up to 12 marijuana plants, kept in an enclosed, locked facility, unless that patient specified a primary caregiver during the state registration process.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Section 4 immunity also requires that the registered qualifying patient was engaged in the medical use of marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\">Similarly, \u00a7 4(b) provides immunity to registered primary caregivers. It states, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>(b) A primary caregiver who has been issued and possesses a registry identification card shall not be subject to arrest, prosecution, or penalty in any manner ... for assisting a qualifying patient to whom he or she is connected through the department\u2019s registration process with the medical use of marihuana in accordance with this act.... This subsection applies only if the primary caregiver possesses an amount of marihuana that does not exceed:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-3\">(1) 2.5 ounces of usable marihuana for each qualifying patient to whom he or she is connected through the department\u2019s registration process; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-4\">(2) for each registered qualifying patient who has specified that the primary caregiver will be allowed under state law to cultivate marihuana for the qualifying patient, 12 marihuana plants kept in an enclosed, locked facility; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-5\">(3) any incidental amount of seeds, stalks, and unusable roots.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">A primary caregiver, therefore, may only possess up to 2.5 ounces of usable marijuana and 12 marijuana plants in an enclosed, locked facility for each registered qualifying patient who has specified the primary caregiver during the state registration process. Similar to \u00a7 4(a), this section only applies if the primary caregiver is assisting a qualifying patient with the medical use of marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">1. PROCEDURAL ASPECTS OF \u00a7 4</p>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">We begin our analysis of the procedural aspects of \u00a7 4 with the rather unremarkable proposition that entitlement to immunity under \u00a7 4 is a question of law. Immunity is a unique creature in the law and is distinguishable from other traditional criminal defenses. A successful claim of immunity excuses an alleged offender for engaging in otherwise illegal conduct, regardless of the sufficiency of proofs in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>underlying case. This is consistent with the way claims of immunity are handled in other areas of law.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> Moreover, the parties agree that \u00a7 4 immunity should be determined as a matter of law. There is no indication that the voters who enacted the MMMA intended to treat \u00a7 4 immunity differently than other claims of immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">Our decision in <em>Kolanek </em>supports this conclusion. There we explained that \u00a7 4 \u201c \u2018grants qualifying patient[s]\u2019 who hold \u2018registry identification card[s]\u2019 broad immunity <em>from </em>criminal prosecution, civil penalties, and disciplinary actions.\u201d<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> A registered qualifying patient, however, \u201cwho do[es] not qualify for immunity under \u00a7 4, as well as unregistered persons, are entitled to assert <em>in </em>a criminal prosecution the affirmative defense . . . under \u00a7 8 . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> By contrasting the broad grant of immunity in \u00a7 4 <em>\u201cfrom </em>prosecution\u201d with the affirmative defense in \u00a7 8 <em>\u201cin </em>a criminal prosecution,\u201d we implied that the decision regarding entitlement to immunity must be made before trial. By its very nature, immunity must be decided by the trial court as a matter of law, and in pretrial proceedings, in order to establish immunity <em>from </em>prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">Deciding these questions of law necessarily involves resolving factual disputes. To determine whether a defendant is entitled to the \u00a7 4 grant of immunity, the trial court must make factual determinations, including whether the defendant has a valid registry identi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>fication card and whether he or she complied with the volume, storage, and medical use limitations. The expediency of having the trial court resolve factual questions surrounding \u00a7 4 underscores the purpose of granting immunity <em>from </em>prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">Other matters routinely conducted in pretrial contexts, such as entrapment hearings, call for the trial court to act as both the finder of fact and arbiter of law.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> Like entrapment, \u00a7 4 immunity \u201cis not a defense that negates an essential element of the charged crime. Instead, it presents facts that are collateral to the crime that justify barring the defendant\u2019s prosecution.\u201d<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> We therefore conclude that the trial court must resolve factual disputes for the purpose of determining \u00a7 4 immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">Of course, the trial court\u2019s determinations are not without review. Questions of law are reviewed de novo by appellate courts.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> Atrial court\u2019s factual findings are subject to appellate review under the clearly erroneous standard:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-7\">Findings of fact by the trial court may not be set aside unless clearly erroneous. In the application of this principle, regard shall be given to the special opportunity of the trial court to judge the credibility of the witnesses who appeared before it.1<footnotemark>44</footnotemark>1</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">We find no reason, nor have the parties offered any reason, to deviate from this model of appellate review. Therefore, we conclude that specific factual findings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>made by the trial court in a \u00a7 4 immunity hearing are reviewed under the clearly erroneous standard, and questions of law surrounding the grant or denial of \u00a7 4 immunity are reviewed de novo. Further, the trial court\u2019s ultimate grant or denial of immunity is fact-dependent and is reviewed for clear error.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">2. SUBSTANTIVE ASPECTS OF \u00a7 4</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">Section 4 provides a broad grant of immunity from criminal prosecution and civil penalties to registered qualifying patients and connected primary caregivers. As we have stated, the statute leaves much to be desired regarding the proper implementation of this grant of immunity. When addressing this question, we must consider (a) the evidentiary burden required to establish immunity and the presumption of medical use under \u00a7 4; (b) the elements required to establish immunity and the presumption of medical use; and (c) what evidence may properly rebut a presumption of medical use.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">a. BURDEN OF PROOF</p>\n<p id=\"b445-8\">The MMMA is silent regarding the burden of proof necessary for a defendant to be entitled to immunity under \u00a7 4. When statutes are silent as to the burden of proof, \u201cwe are free to assign it as we see fit, as long as we do not transgress the constitutional requirement that we not place on the defendant the burden of persuasion to negate an element of the crime.\u201d<footnotemark>46</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>Assigning the burden of proof involves two distinct legal concepts. The first, the burden of production, requires a party to produce some evidence of that party\u2019s propositions of fact.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> The second, the burden of persuasion, requires a party to convince the trier of fact that those propositions of fact are true.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> The prosecution has the burden of proving every element of a charged crime beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> This rule of law exists in part to ensure that \u201cthere is a presumption of innocence in favor of the accused . . . and its enforcement lies at the foundation of the administration of our criminal law.\u201d<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> To place the burden on a criminal defendant to negate a specific element of a crime would clearly run afoul of this axiomatic, elementary, and undoubted principle of law.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">A defendant invoking \u00a7 4 immunity, however, does so without regard to any presumption of innocence. The defendant does not dispute any element of the underlying charge when claiming immunity. Indeed, the defendant may even admit to otherwise unlawful conduct and yet still be entitled to \u00a7 4 immunity. When <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>claiming \u00a7 4 immunity, the defendant places himself in an offensive position, affirmatively arguing entitlement to \u00a7 4 immunity without regard to his or her underlying guilt or innocence of the crime charged. In <em>People v D\u2019Angelo, </em>we determined that the accusatorial nature of a defendant\u2019s request for a defense of entrapment, without regard to his or her guilt or innocence of the underlying criminal charge, required the burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence to be allocated to the defendant.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> The accusatorial nature of an entrapment defense and the offensive nature of immunity are similar because in both the defendant posits an affirmative argument, rather than defending a particular charge. We now follow this well-established rule of criminal procedure and assign to the defendant the burden of proving \u00a7 4 immunity by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">b. ELEMENTS REQUIRED TO ESTABLISH IMMUNITY</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">A defendant may claim entitlement to immunity for any or all charged offenses. Once a claim of immunity is made, the trial court must conduct an evidentiary hearing to factually determine whether, for each claim of immunity, the defendant has proved each element required for immunity. These elements consist of whether, at the time of the charged offense, the defendant:</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">(1) was issued and possessed a valid registry identification card,</p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">(2) complied with the requisite volume limitations of \u00a7 4(a) and \u00a7 4(b),</p>\n<p id=\"b447-9\">(3) stored any marijuana plants in an enclosed, locked facility, and</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>(4) was engaged in the medical use of marijuana.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">The court must examine the first element of immunity\u2014possession of a valid registry identification card\u2014on a charge-by-charge basis. In most cases, satisfying the first element will be an all-or-nothing proposition. A qualifying patient or primary caregiver who does not have a valid registry identification card is not entitled to immunity because the first element required for immunity cannot be satisfied. Conversely, a qualifying patient or primary caregiver satisfies the first element of immunity if he or she possessed a valid registry identification card at all times relevant to the charged offenses. In some cases, there may be a gap between a qualifying patient\u2019s or a primary caregiver\u2019s earliest conduct underlying the charged offenses and his or her most recent conduct. A court must pay special attention to whether the effective date or expiration date of a registry identification card occurred within this gap and determine whether the conduct occurred when the patient or caregiver possessed a valid registry identification card. A qualifying patient or primary caregiver can only satisfy the first element of immunity for any charge if all conduct underlying that charge occurred during a time when the qualifying patient or primary caregiver possessed a valid registry identification card.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">Generally, the second and third elements of immunity are also all-or-nothing propositions. The second element\u2014the volume limitations of \u00a7 4(a) and \u00a7 4(b)\u2014 requires that the qualifying patient or primary caregiver be in possession of no more than a specified amount of usable marijuana and a specified number of marijuana plants. When a primary caregiver is con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>nected with one or more qualifying patients, the amount of usable marijuana and the number of plants is calculated in the aggregate\u20142.5 ounces of usable marijuana and 12 marijuana plants for each qualifying patient, including the caregiver if he or she is also a registered qualifying patient acting as his or her own caregiver.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> When a qualifying patient cultivates his or her own marijuana for medical use and is not connected with a caregiver, the patient is limited to 2.5 ounces of usable marijuana and 12 marijuana plants. A qualifying patient or primary caregiver in possession of more marijuana than allowed under \u00a7 4(a) and \u00a7 4(b) at the time of the charged offense cannot satisfy the second element of immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">The third element of \u00a7 4 immunity requires all marijuana plants possessed by a qualifying patient or primary caregiver to be kept in an enclosed, locked facility. Thus, a qualifying patient or primary caregiver whose marijuana plants are not kept in an enclosed, locked facility at the time of the charged offense cannot satisfy the third element and cannot receive immunity for the charged offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">The fourth element conditions immunity on the \u201cmedical use\u201d of marijuana, as defined in \u00a7 3(f). Unlike elements two and three, the fourth element does not depend on the defendant\u2019s aggregate conduct. Instead, this element depends on whether the conduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>forming the basis of each particular criminal charge involved \u201cthe acquisition, possession, cultivation, manufacture, use, internal possession, delivery, transfer, or transportation of marihuana or paraphernalia relating to the administration of marihuana to treat or alleviate a registered qualifying patient\u2019s debilitating medical condition or symptoms associated with the debilitating medical condition.\u201d<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> Whether a qualifying patient or primary caregiver was engaged in the medical use of marijuana must be determined on a charge-by-charge basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-3\">While the qualifying patient or primary caregiver retains the burden of proving this fourth and last element of immunity, \u00a7 4(d) of the MMMA creates a rebuttable presumption of medical use when the qualifying patient or primary caregiver satisfies certain requirements.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-4\">(d) There shall be a presumption that a qualifying patient or primary caregiver is engaged in the medical use of marihuana in accordance with this act if the qualifying patient or primary caregiver:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-5\">(1) is in possession of a registry identification card; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-6\">(2) is in possession of an amount of marihuana that does not exceed the amount allowed under this act. The presumption [that one is engaged in the medical use of marihuana] may be rebutted by evidence that conduct related to marihuana was not for the purpose of alleviating the qualifying patient\u2019s debilitating medical condition or symptoms associated with the debilitating medical condition, in accordance with this act.[<footnotemark>56</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">The requirements necessary to establish the presumption of medical use mirror the first two elements required to establish immunity. Therefore, a qualifying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>patient or primary caregiver is entitled to the presumption of medical use in \u00a7 4(d) simply by establishing the first two elements of \u00a7 4 immunity.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b451-3\">In sum, a qualifying patient seeking to assert the protections of \u00a7 4 must prove four elements by a preponderance of the evidence. A qualifying patient must prove that, at the time of the charged offense, he or she (1) possessed a valid registry identification card,- (2) possessed no more marijuana than allowed under \u00a7 4(a); (3) stored any marijuana plants in an enclosed, locked facility; and (4) was engaged in the medical use of marijuana. If the qualifying patient establishes the first and second elements, then a presumption exists that the qualifying patient was engaged in the medical use of marijuana, thereby establishing the fourth element.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\">Similarly, a primary caregiver seeking to assert the protections of \u00a7 4 must prove four elements by a preponderance of the evidence. A primary caregiver must prove that, at the time of the charged offense, he or she (1) possessed a valid registry identification card; (2) possessed no more marijuana than allowed under \u00a7 4(b); (3) stored any marijuana plants in an enclosed, locked facility; and (4) was assisting connected qualifying patients with the medical use of marijuana. If the primary caregiver establishes the first and second elements, then a presumption exists that the primary caregiver was engaged in the medical use of marijuana, thereby establishing the fourth element.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">c. REBUTTING THE PRESUMPTION</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">The presumption of the medical use of marijuana is a powerful tool for a defendant in asserting \u00a7 4 immunity. But this presumption is rebuttable:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>The presumption [that one is engaged in the medical use of marihuana] may be rebutted by evidence that conduct related to marihuana was not for the purpose of alleviating the qualifying patient\u2019s debilitating medical condition or symptoms associated with the debilitating medical condition, in accordance with this act.[<footnotemark>58</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">According to \u00a7 4(d)(2), the presumption of the medical use of marijuana may be rebutted by examining \u201cconduct related to marihuana . .. .\u201d While the statute does not specifically state whose marijuana-related conduct may be used, when read in context it is clear that it refers to the defendant\u2019s conduct. Stated differently, in \u00a7 4(d), only the defendant\u2019s conduct may be considered to rebut the presumption of the medical use of marijuana. This interpretation is consistent with the purpose of \u00a7 4, which is to provide immunity from prosecution to a defendant who abides by certain restrictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">For this reason, we hold that the prosecution may not rebut a primary caregiver\u2019s presumption of medical use by introducing evidence of conduct unrelated to the primary caregiver,<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> such as evidence that a connected qualifying patient does not actually have a debilitating medical condition or evidence that a connected qualifying patient used marijuana for nonmedical purposes. Similarly, the prosecution may not rebut a qualifying patient\u2019s presumption of medical use by introducing evidence that the connected primary caregiver used the qualifying patient\u2019s marijuana for nonmedical purposes.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>We must also determine whether one or more transactions that are outside the scope of the MMMA may rebut the presumption of medical use for otherwise-compliant MMMA conduct. As noted \u00a7 4(d)(2) provides the prosecution with the ability to rebut this presumption.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">In <em>Tuttle, </em>the Court of Appeals held that a noncom-pliant marijuana transaction negates a defendant\u2019s ability to claim \u00a7 4 immunity as to the defendant\u2019s entire marijuana-related conduct. The court determined that \u201c\u00a7 4 does not allow [a] defendant to decouple . . . illicit actions involving marijuana from . . . other [wise MMMA-compliant] marijuana-related activities . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> The court concluded that illicit marijuana-related conduct rebuts the \u00a7 4(d) presumption of medical use for otherwise MMMA-compliant conduct.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">The prosecution agrees with the Court of Appeals, arguing that if a primary caregiver has provided marijuana to an unconnected individual, the presumption of medical use has been rebutted for all of the primary caregiver\u2019s marijuana-related conduct, including con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>duct that otherwise complies with \u00a7 4. Therefore, according to the prosecution, any unprotected marijuana-related conduct rebuts a defendant\u2019s presumption of medical use for all of the defendant\u2019s marijuana-related conduct, regardless of its relevance to the charged offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-3\">Tuttle argues that unprotected marijuana-related conduct may only rebut the presumption as to otherwise protected conduct if a nexus exists between the unprotected conduct and the protected conduct. In <em>Tuttle, </em>Counts I through III relate to unprotected transfers of marijuana from Tuttle to an unconnected patient. Tuttle agrees that this conduct is not protected and that there is no \u00a7 4 immunity with regard to that conduct. Counts IV through VII, however, relate to the marijuana being manufactured in Tuttle\u2019s home. Tuttle argues that the conduct in Counts I through III does not necessarily affect the conduct underlying Counts IV through VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">Tuttle specifically stresses that \u00a7 4(d)(2) provides that the presumption of medical use \u201cmay\u201d be rebutted. Tuttle relies on the word \u201cmay\u201d for the proposition that the trial court in its fact-finding capacity may either reject or accept evidence presented by the prosecution. Therefore, Tuttle claims, the trial court is not obligated to accept evidence of an unrelated and unprotected transaction to rebut the presumption of medical use for an otherwise protected transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">It is clear, as Tuttle concedes, that conduct violating the MMMA directly rebuts the presumption of medical use when a defendant\u2019s charges are based on that specific conduct (such as the illicit conduct on which Counts I through III against Tuttle are based). It is not clear, however, that conduct violating the MMMA would also rebut the presumption of medical use related to other charges against the defendant when the illicit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>conduct does not form the basis of charges (such as the otherwise MMMA-compliant conduct on which Counts IV through VII against Tuttle are based). While the statutory language is neither compelling nor expressly direct, we nonetheless conclude that the statutory text lends support for Tuttle\u2019s proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">Use of the permissive \u201cmay,\u201d in conjunction with the trial court\u2019s general gatekeeping responsibility to admit only relevant evidence,<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> leads us to conclude that to rebut the presumption of medical use the prosecution\u2019s rebuttal evidence must be relevant, such that the illicit conduct would allow the fact-finder to conclude that the otherwise MMMA-compliant conduct was not for the medical use of marijuana. In other words, the illicit conduct and the otherwise MMMA-compliant conduct must have a nexus to one another in order to rebut the \u00a7 4(d) presumption. This is consistent with the conclusions that the fourth element of immunity\u2014 medical use\u2014is dependent only on the conduct forming the basis for each particular criminal charge and that immunity is claimed and generally proved on a charge-by-charge basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">Further, Tuttle\u2019s view not only has statutory support, but also comports with how generally a presumption should be rebutted. Only relevant evidence that allows the fact-finder to conclude that the underlying conduct was not for \u201cmedical use\u201d may rebut the \u00a7 4(d) presumption. A wholly unrelated transaction\u2014i.e., a transaction with no nexus, and therefore no relevance, to the conduct resulting in the charged offense\u2014does not assist the fact-finder in determining whether the defendant actually was engaged in the medical use of marijuana during the charged offense. Conduct unre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>lated to the charged offense is irrelevant and does not rebut the presumption of medical use.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">Therefore, under \u00a7 4(d)(2), the prosecution may rebut the presumption of medical use for each claim of immunity. Improper conduct related to one charged offense may not be imputed to another charged offense unless the prosecution can establish a nexus between the improper conduct and the otherwise MMMA-compliant conduct. The trial court must ultimately determine whether a defendant has established by a preponderance of the evidence that he or she was engaged in the medical use of marijuana. The defendant may do so by establishing this powerful presumption of medical use. If the presumption of medical use has been rebutted, however, the defendant may still prove through other evidence that, with regard to the underlying conduct that resulted in the charged offense and for which the defendant claims immunity, the defendant was engaged in the medical use of marijuana, as defined in \u00a7 3(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">C. SECTION 8 DEFENSE</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">Section 8(a) of the MMMA provides any patient or primary caregiver\u2014regardless of registration with the state\u2014with the ability to assert an affirmative defense to a marijuana-related offense. The affirmative defense \u201cshall be presumed valid where the evidence shows\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-8\">(1) A physician has stated that, in the physician\u2019s professional opinion, after having completed a foil assessment of the patient\u2019s medical history and current medical condition made in the course of a bona fide physician-patient relationship, the patient is likely to receive therapeutic or palliative benefit from the medical use of marihuana to treat or alleviate the patient\u2019s serious or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>debilitating medical condition or symptoms of the patient\u2019s serious or debilitating medical condition;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-5\">(2) The patient and the patient\u2019s primary caregiver, if any, were collectively in possession of a quantity of marihuana that was not more than was reasonably necessary to ensure the uninterrupted availability of marihuana for the purpose of treating or alleviating the patient\u2019s serious or debilitating medical condition or symptoms of the patient\u2019s serious or debilitating medical condition; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-6\">(3) The patient and the patient\u2019s primary caregiver, if any, were engaged in the acquisition, possession, cultivation, manufacture, use, delivery, transfer, or transportation of marihuana or paraphernalia relating to the use of marihuana to treat or alleviate the patient\u2019s serious or debilitating medical condition or symptoms of the patient\u2019s serious or debilitating medical condition.[<footnotemark>65</footnotemark>)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">In <em>Kolanek, </em>we determined that if a defendant establishes these elements and no question of fact exists regarding these elements, then the defendant is entitled to dismissal of the criminal charges.<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> We also clarified that if questions of fact exist, then \u201cdismissal of the charges is not appropriate and the defense must be submitted to the jury.\u201d<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> Additionally, if a defendant has not presented prima facie evidence of each element of \u00a7 8 by \u201cpresent [ing] evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude that the defendant satisfied the elements of the \u00a7 8 affirmative defense,. . . then the circuit court must deny the motion to dismiss the charges,\u201d and \u201cthe defendant is not permitted to present the \u00a7 8 defense to the jury.\u201d<footnotemark>68</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b458-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>A defendant seeking to assert the MMMA\u2019s statutory affirmative defense must present prima facie evidence for each element of \u00a7 8(a).<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> Overcoming this initial hurdle of presenting prima facie evidence of each element is not an easy task. The elements of \u00a7 8 are clearly more onerous than the elements of \u00a7 4. The statutory scheme of the MMMA is designed to benefit those who properly register and are meticulous in their adherence to the law. Presumably, a properly registered defendant facing criminal charges would invoke immunity under \u00a7 4. However, a \u00a7 8 defense may be pursued by any defendant, regardless of registration status. With this background, we consider each element of the \u00a7 8 affirmative defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-3\">1. SECTION 8(a)(1): THE IMPRIMATUR OP THE PHYSICIAN-PATIENT RELATIONSHIP</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">Section 8(a)(1) requires a physician to determine the patient\u2019s suitability for the medical use of marijuana. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-5\">(1) A physician has stated that, in the physician\u2019s professional opinion, after having completed a full assessment of the patient\u2019s medical history and current medical condition made in the course of a bona fide physician-patient relationship, the patient is likely to receive therapeutic or palliative benefit from the medical use of marihuana to treat or alleviate the patient\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>serious or debilitating medical condition or symptoms of the patient\u2019s serious or debilitating medical condition].]1<footnotemark>70</footnotemark>1</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b459-3\">This provision may be reduced to three elements:</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">(1) The existence of a bona fide physician-patient relationship,</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">(2) in which the physician completes a full assessment of the patient\u2019s medical history and current medical condition, and</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">(3) from which results the physician\u2019s professional opinion that the patient has a debilitating medical condition and will likely benefit from the medical use of marijuana to treat the debilitating medical condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">Each of these elements must be proved in order to establish the imprimatur of the physician-patient relationship required under \u00a7 8(a)(1) of the MMMA. Hartwick and Tuttle argue that the registry identification card establishes these three elements. We do not find merit in this position.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-8\">As part of the process for obtaining a registry identification card, an applicant must submit, among other materials, a \u201cwritten certification.\u201d<footnotemark>71</footnotemark> At the time of the offenses at issue,<footnotemark>72</footnotemark> the MMMA defined a written certification as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-9\">a document signed by a physician, stating the patient\u2019s debilitating medical condition and stating that, in the physician\u2019s professional opinion, the patient is likely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>to receive therapeutic or palliative benefit from the medical use of marihuana to treat or alleviate the patient\u2019s debilitating medical condition or symptoms associated with the debilitating medical condition.[<footnotemark>73</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">Thus, at the time of the offenses at issue, a written certification was a document prepared by a physician that contained at least two representations: (1) the patient has a debilitating medical condition, and (2) the patient will likely benefit from the medical use of marijuana. Further, MCL 333.26426(c) provides that the department \u201cshall verify the information contained in an application\u201d and that the department \u201cmay deny an application . . . only if the applicant did not provide the information required pursuant to this section, or if the department determines that the information provided was falsified.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">Comparing the definition of \u201cwritten certification\u201d with the elements of \u00a7 8(a)(1), a registry identification card satisfies the third element (the patient has a debilitating medical condition and would likely benefit from the medical use of marijuana). A registry identification card, however, does not establish the second element (a physician has completed a full assessment of the patient\u2019s medical history and current medical condition).<footnotemark>74</footnotemark> The second element must be established through medical records or other evidence submitted to show that the physician actually completed a full assessment of the patient\u2019s medical history and current medical condition before concluding that the patient is likely to benefit from the medical use of marijuana and before the patient engages in the medi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>cal use of marijuana. Additionally, the physician certification leaves unsatisfied the first element of \u00a7 8(a)(1) (the existence of a bona fide physician-patient relationship).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">At the time of the offenses at issue, the MMMA did not define \u201cbona fide physician-patient relationship.\u201d<footnotemark>75</footnotemark> In <em>Kolanek, </em>we stated that \u201cthis term envisions \u2018a pre-existing and ongoing relationship with the patient as a treating physician.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>76</footnotemark> Thus, to satisfy the first element\u2014the existence of a bona fide physician-patient relationship\u2014there must be proof of an actual and ongoing physician-patient relationship at the time the written certification was issued.<footnotemark>77</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>A primary caregiver has the burden of establishing the elements of \u00a7 8(a)(1) for each patient to whom the primary caregiver is alleged to have unlawfully provided marijuana. In this context, a primary caregiver who provides marijuana to a putative patient plainly assumes the risk that the patient does not actually meet the elements of \u00a7 8(a)(1) or that the patient may not cooperate in a subsequent prosecution of the primary caregiver, regardless what that person may have otherwise told the primary caregiver.<footnotemark>78</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b463-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>2. SECTION 8(a)(2): THE QUANTITY OF MARIJUANA</p>\n<p id=\"b463-3\">Section 8(a)(2) requires a patient or primary caregiver to show that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-4\">[the] patient and the patient\u2019s primary caregiver, if any, were collectively in possession of a quantity of marihuana that was not more than was reasonably necessary to ensure the uninterrupted availability of marihuana for the purpose of treating or alleviating the patient\u2019s serious or debilitating medical condition or symptoms of the patient\u2019s serious or debilitating medical condition[.][<footnotemark>79</footnotemark>1</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">The critical phrase from the above quoted passage is \u201creasonably necessary to ensure uninterrupted availability of marihuana [for treatment] <em>. . . </em>Hartwick and Tuttle maintain that a registry identification card establishes a presumption that any amount of marijuana possessed by a defendant is a reasonable amount of marijuana under the MMMA. In the alternative, they argue that a valid registry identification card, coupled with compliance with the volume limitations in \u00a7 4, establishes a presumption that the amount of marijuana possessed is reasonable. Again, we do not find support for the defendants\u2019 position in the text of the MMMA.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">The issuance of a registry identification card or compliance with the volume limitations in \u00a7 4 does not show that an individual possesses only a \u201creasonably necessary\u201d amount of marijuana \u201cto ensure uninterrupted availability\u201d for the purposes of \u00a7 8(a)(2). A registry identification card simply qualifies a patient for the medical use of marijuana. It does not guarantee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>that an individual will always possess only the amount of marijuana allowed under the MMMA.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">Further, nothing in the MMMA supports the notion that the quantity limits found in the immunity provision of \u00a7 4 should be judicially imposed on the affirmative defense provision of \u00a7 8. Sections 4 and 8 feature contrasting statutory language intended to serve two very different purposes.<footnotemark>80</footnotemark> Section 4 creates a specific volume limitation applicable to those seeking immunity. In contrast, \u00a7 8 leaves open the volume limitation to that which is \u201creasonably necessary.\u201d The MMMA could have specified a specific volume limitation in \u00a7 8, but it did not. In the absence of such an express limitation, we will not judicially assign to \u00a7 8 the volume limitation in \u00a7 4 to create a presumption of compliance with \u00a7 8(a)(2). Indeed, the only instance in which a primary caregiver must control a patient\u2019s dosage is when he or she is the parent of a minor patient.<footnotemark>81</footnotemark> That the statute requires these particular caregivers to control a patient\u2019s dosage, but does not require it of others, indicates that all other caregivers need not be particularly aware of their patients\u2019 medical needs. Instead, a primary caregiver may reasonably rely on the amount his or her patient states is needed to treat the patient\u2019s debilitating medical condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">A patient seeking to assert a \u00a7 8 affirmative defense may have to testify about whether a specific amount of marijuana alleviated the debilitating medical condition and if not, what adjustments were made to the consumption rate and the amount of marijuana consumed to determine an appropriate quantity. Once the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>patient establishes the amount of usable marijuana needed to treat the patient\u2019s debilitating medical condition, determining whether the patient possessed \u201ca quantity of marihuana that was not more than was reasonably necessary to ensure [its] uninterrupted availability\u201d also depends on how the patient obtains marijuana and the reliability of this source. This would necessitate some examination of the patient/caregiver relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">The same analysis applies to primary caregivers seeking to present a defense under \u00a7 8. Primary caregivers must establish the amount of usable marijuana needed to treat their patients\u2019 debilitating medical conditions and then how many marijuana plants the primary caregiver needs to grow in order ensure \u201cuninterrupted availability\u201d for the caregiver\u2019s patients. This likely would include testimony regarding how much usable marijuana each patient required and how many marijuana plants and how much usable marijuana the primary caregiver needed in order to ensure each patient the \u201cuninterrupted availability\u201d of marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">3. SECTION 8(a)(3): THE USE OF MARIJUANA FOR A MEDICAL PURPOSE</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">Section 8(a)(3) requires a patient or primary caregiver to show that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-8\">[t]he patient and the patient\u2019s primary caregiver, if any, were engaged in the acquisition, possession, cultivation, manufacture, use, delivery, transfer, or transportation of marihuana or paraphernalia relating to the use of marihuana to treat or alleviate the patient\u2019s serious or debilitating medical condition or symptoms of the patient\u2019s serious or debilitating medical condition.1<footnotemark>82</footnotemark>1</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b466-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>Although there is a purposeful distinction made between the amount of marijuana permitted under \u00a7 4 and the \u201creasonably necessary\u201d restraint on quantity found in \u00a7 8(a)(2), \u00a7 8(a)(3) requires a patient and primary caregiver to show that any marijuana use complied with a very similar \u201cmedical use\u201d requirement found in \u00a7 4, and defined in \u00a7 3(f):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-5\">\u201cMedical use\u201d means the acquisition, possession, cultivation, manufacture, use, internal possession, delivery, transfer, or transportation of marihuana or paraphernalia relating to the administration of marihuana to treat or alleviate a registered qualifying patient\u2019s debilitating medical condition or symptoms associated with the debilitating medical condition.f<footnotemark>83</footnotemark>)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">The slight variance between the definition of \u201cmedical use\u201d in \u00a7 4 and medical use as it appears in \u00a7 8 can be attributed to the fact that only registered qualifying patients and registered primary caregivers may engage in the \u201cmedical use\u201d of marijuana, as indicated by use of the term in \u00a7 4.<footnotemark>84</footnotemark> Those patients and primary caregivers who are not registered may still be entitled to \u00a7 8 protections if they can show that their use of marijuana was for a medical purpose\u2014to treat or alleviate a serious or debilitating medical condition or its symptoms. Hartwick and Tuttle again argue that a registry identification card alone, or a registry identification card coupled with compliance with either the volume limitations of \u00a7 4(a) and (4)(b) or \u00a7 8(a)(2), satisfies \u00a7 8(a)(3). Once again, defendants seek to attribute greater significance to the registry identifica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>tion card than that which is expressly provided in the MMMA. We simply do not find support for the defendants\u2019 arguments in the text of the MMMA.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">A registry identification card merely qualifies a patient for the medical use of marijuana. It does not establish that at the time of the charged offense, the defendant was actually engaged in the protected use of marijuana. Section 8(a)(3) requires that both the patient\u2019s and the primary caregiver\u2019s use of marijuana be for a medical purpose, and that their conduct be described by the language in \u00a7 8(a)(3). Thus, patients must present prima facie evidence regarding their use of marijuana for a medical purpose regardless whether they possess a registry identification card. Primary caregivers would also have to present prima facie evidence of their own use of marijuana for a medical purpose and any patients\u2019 use of marijuana for a medical purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">III. APPLICATION TO <em>HARTWICK </em>AND <em>TUTTLE</em></p>\n<p id=\"ANS\">A. <em>PEOPLE v HARTWICK</em></p>\n<p id=\"AGk\">1. SECTION 4 IMMUNITY</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">Hartwick is a registered qualifying patient, his own caregiver, and at all times pertinent to this dispute, a primary caregiver to five registered qualifying patients. The prosecuting attorney charged Hartwick with manufacturing marijuana and possession of marijuana with the intent to deliver. Hartwick sought to invoke \u00a7 4 immunity. In order to qualify for \u00a7 4 immunity, Hartwick must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that for each charged offense he</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">(1) possessed a valid registry identification card for himself as a qualifying patient and for each of the five other connected registered qualifying patients,</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>(2) possessed no more than 72 marijuana plants and 15 ounces of usable marijuana,<footnotemark>85</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">(3) kept the marijuana plants in an enclosed, locked facility, and</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">(4) was engaged in the medical use of marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">Hartwick is entitled to a presumption of the medical use of marijuana if he shows by a preponderance of the evidence that he possessed:</p>\n<p id=\"b468-9\">(1) a valid registry identification card for himself as a patient and for each of the five other registered qualifying patients to whom he is connected under the MMMA, and</p>\n<p id=\"b468-10\">(2) no more than 72 marijuana plants and 15 ounces of usable marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-11\">The prosecution may then rebut this presumption in accordance with \u00a7 4(d)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-12\">The lower courts erred with respect to Hartwick\u2019s entitlement to immunity under \u00a7 4. There is no statutory requirement under \u00a7 4 that Hartwick know the debilitating conditions of, the amount of marijuana needed for, the length of time treatment should continue for, or the identities of the physicians of, the registered qualifying patients to whom Hartwick is connected under the MMMA. This lack of information cannot be used to rebut Hartwick\u2019s presumption of the medical use of marijuana under \u00a7 4(d). For purposes of \u00a7 4, the lower courts should have instead focused on Hartwick\u2019s conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>The Court of Appeals also should not have determined that the number of marijuana plants Hartwick possessed was \u201cmoot.\u201d<footnotemark>86</footnotemark> The trial court never made a factual determination of the number of marijuana plants in Hartwick\u2019s possession or the other elements of \u00a7 4. Even if such facts had been established, the Court of Appeals reviews the trial court\u2019s factual findings for clear error. Thus, a new \u00a7 4 evidentiary hearing conforming to the holdings expressed in this opinion is necessary to determine Hartwick\u2019s entitlement to \u00a7 4 immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-3\">2. SECTION 8 DEFENSE</p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\">In contrast to Hartwick\u2019s claim of immunity under \u00a7 4, the lower courts correctly concluded that Hartwick was not entitled to the \u00a7 8 affirmative defense. Even though Hartwick provided testimony of his own medical condition and evidence of registry identification cards for himself and five patients, he did not present prima facie evidence for each element of \u00a7 8(a). Specifically, Hartwick failed to provide any evidence of \u00a7 8(a)(1) (bona fide physician-patient relationship), \u00a7 8(a)(2) (amount of marijuana the patients needed), or \u00a7 8(a)(3) (whether the patients engaged in the use of marijuana for a medical purpose).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">Further, to the extent the Court of Appeals determined that a written certification was comparable to a pharmaceutical prescription, this determination was erroneous. A written certification is not similar to that of a pharmaceutical prescription. Marijuana is a Schedule 1 controlled substance.<footnotemark>87</footnotemark> Therefore, a doctor is not legally able to prescribe marijuana to an indi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>vidual for any reason. A written certification is a statutorily mandated document that must meet specific statutory requirements so that an individual may successfully apply for a registry identification card. While the MMMA states that \u201c [m]odern medical research . . . has discovered beneficial uses for marihuana in treating. . . debilitating medical conditions,\u201d<footnotemark>88</footnotemark> the terminology employed in the MMMA and the actual function of primary caregivers and patients is not comparable to a medical doctor\u2019s treatment of an actual patient. Primary caregivers carry out a statutorily created task that is completely unrelated to how a doctor would treat a patient.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">B. <em>PEOPLE v TUTTLE</em></p>\n<p id=\"Aab9\">1. SECTION 4 IMMUNITY</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">Tuttle is a registered qualifying patient, his own caregiver, and a primary caregiver to at least one registered qualifying patient. The prosecuting attorney charged Tuttle with multiple counts of manufacturing, possessing, and delivering marijuana. Tuttle sought to have Counts IV through VII, which relate to the manufacture and possession of marijuana in Tut-tle\u2019s home, dismissed under the immunity provisions of \u00a7 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">In order to qualify for immunity under \u00a7 4, Tuttle must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that for each charged offense he</p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">(1) possessed a valid registry identification card for himself as a qualifying patient and for each connected registered qualifying patient,</p>\n<p id=\"b471-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>(2) possessed no more than the volume of marijuana permitted by \u00a7 4(a) and \u00a7 4(b),<footnotemark>89</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b471-3\">(3) kept the marijuana plants in an enclosed, locked facility, and</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">(4) was engaged in the medical use of marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">Tuttle is entitled to a presumption that he was engaged in the medical use of marijuana if he shows by a preponderance of the evidence that he possessed:</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">(1) a valid registry identification card for himself as a patient and for each connected registered qualifying patient, and</p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">(2) no more than the volume of marijuana allowed by \u00a7 4(a) and \u00a7 4(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-9\">The prosecution may then rebut this presumption in accordance with \u00a7 4(d)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-10\">The lower courts erred when they concluded that Tuttle\u2019s provision of marijuana to Lalonde necessarily tainted all of Tuttle\u2019s marijuana-related activity thereby negating his ability to claim \u00a7 4 immunity for each charged offense. Providing marijuana to Lalonde did not per se taint all of Tuttle\u2019s marijuana-related conduct. Tuttle was not connected to Lalonde under the MMMA. Therefore, Tuttle was clearly outside the parameters of \u00a7 4 when he provided marijuana to Lalonde (Counts I through III).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-11\">Tuttle, however, may still be entitled to immunity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>for the remaining charges in Counts IV through VIL With regard to the charges of possessing and manufacturing marijuana in his home, the trial court must make factual determinations regarding the number of patients connected to Tuttle under the MMMA, the number of marijuana plants Tuttle had in his home and the amount of usable marijuana Tuttle possessed,<footnotemark>90</footnotemark> whether the marijuana plants were stored in an enclosed, locked facility, and whether Tuttle was engaged in the medical use of marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">Tuttle must prove entitlement to immunity for each charged offense. And the prosecution may only use evidence of conduct relating to one charged offense to rebut the presumption of medical use for another charged offense if a nexus exists between the charged offenses. Put simply, improper conduct related to La-londe in Counts I through III may only affect Counts IV through VII if the prosecution can establish a nexus between the improper conduct in Counts I through III and the otherwise MMMA through compliant conduct in Counts IV through VII. Only if this nexus exists can the trial court determine that the illicit conduct in Counts I through III rebuts the presumption that Tuttle was engaged in the medical use of marijuana for the conduct underlying Counts IV through VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">The trial court must ultimately weigh the evidence to determine if the prosecution successfully rebutted Tut-tle\u2019s presumption of medical use for Counts IV through VII by evidence of the conduct relating to marijuana in Counts I through III and, if so, whether Tuttle has otherwise shown that the charged conduct for which he claims immunity was consistent with the medical use of marijuana. The flexibility allowing the trial court to make this decision in \u00a7 4(d) permits the trial court to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>hear evidence to determine if Tuttle truly was a primary caregiver simply trying to assist patients, or if Tuttle acted outside the protection of the MMMA.<footnotemark>91</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">To that end, factual findings are needed to determine Tuttle\u2019s entitlement to immunity under \u00a7 4 for Counts IV through VIL As a result, a new \u00a7 4 eviden-tiary hearing conforming to the holdings expressed in this opinion is necessary to determine Tuttle\u2019s entitlement to \u00a7 4 immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">2. SECTION 8 DEFENSE</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">The lower courts properly concluded that Tuttle was not entitled to the \u00a7 8 affirmative defense. During an evidentiary hearing, Tuttle presented his registry identification card and the registry identification cards belonging to Michael Batke and Frank Colon. Lalonde, Batke, and Colon also testified at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-8\">Lalonde testified that he first came into contact with Tuttle through an unofficial internet site intended to match medical marijuana patients and caregivers. He also testified that he was a registered qualifying patient and that he told Tuttle he was using marijuana to alleviate pain. Lalonde\u2019s testimony, however, did not meet the first and third element of \u00a7 8(a), requiring his condition to be diagnosed in the course of a bona fide physician-patient relationship through which the physician found the condition suitable for the medical use of marijuana. Lalonde did not testify about how much <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>marijuana he needed to treat his debilitating condition under \u00a7 8(a)(2) or if he engaged in the use of marijuana under \u00a7 8(a)(3) to treat his debilitating condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">Batke testified that he was a registered qualifying patient and that Tuttle was connected to him as a registered caregiver. Batke also testified that he would call Tuttle every time he needed marijuana. As a result, Tuttle provided Batke with approximately two ounces of marijuana a month. This does not speak to the amount of marijuana Batke reasonably needed in order to treat his debilitating condition, only to the amount of marijuana actually provided. Nor did Batke establish that he had a bona fide relationship with a physician. Lastly, Colon testified that he was a registered qualifying patient, that he had a medical condition, and that he utilized Tuttle as a caregiver. Colon stated he would request between one and two ounces of marijuana each week from Tuttle. Colon did not testify that he received a full medical assessment in the course of a bona fide physician-patient relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">Lalonde\u2019s, Batke\u2019s, and Colon\u2019s testimony was deficient in establishing at least one element of \u00a7 8(a). Additionally, the patients\u2019 testimony combined with their registry identification cards did not establish prima facie evidence under \u00a7 8(a). Therefore, Tuttle failed to present prima facie evidence of each element of \u00a7 8(a). The Court of Appeals correctly affirmed the trial court\u2019s denial of Tuttle\u2019s motion to dismiss under \u00a7 8 and correctly denied his request to present a \u00a7 8 defense at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">In <em>People v Hartwick, </em>Docket No. 148444, we conclude that (1) the trial court must hold a new eviden-tiary hearing to determine Hartwick\u2019s entitlement to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>immunity under \u00a7 4, and (2) Hartwick is not entitled to an affirmative defense under \u00a7 8.

That physicians are required by statute to prepare a certificate to recommend the medical use of marijuana tends to establish that the certificate is prepared in regular practice. Moreover, nothing prevents a physician from including a statement in the written certificate indicating that it was prepared in the course of a bona fide physician-patient relationship or indicating the physician\u2019s recommendation as to the particular amount of marijuana. Likewise, nothing prevents the department from revising the physician certification to attest to these elements. Nor does anything prevent another individual from creating his or her own written certification acceptable to the department. Accordingly, the written certification could itself provide prima facie evidence of the elements of \u00a7 8(a). Further, a defendant may present patient testimony or other evidence to satisfy his or her burden of presenting prima facie evidence of the elements of \u00a7 8(a).
