Given the overall weakness of the evidence against the defendant and the significance of the witness\u2019s testimony, we conclude that there is a reasonable probability that the prosecution\u2019s exploitation of the substantially misleading testimony affected the verdict. See <em>Napue v Illinois, 360 </em>US 264, 271-272; 79 S Ct 1173; 3 L Ed 2d 1217 (1959). We therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals in part, vacate the defendant\u2019s convictions, and remand this case to the Genesee Circuit Court for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-8\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b700-9\">The defendant was charged with, among other things, armed robbery, MCL 750.529, and first-degree felony murder, MCL 750.316(l)(b), after the police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>found known drug dealer Larry Pass, Jr., dead in Pass\u2019s own home. At the defendant\u2019s trial, two prosecution witnesses claimed to have been present when the defendant allegedly shot Pass. The first witness was codefendant Tarence Lard, who testified for the prosecution as part of a plea agreement for his part in the crime. The second witness was Mark Yancy, who maintained his innocence with respect to the shooting but admitted collecting Pass\u2019s drugs, helping dispose of the murder weapon, and using cocaine with the defendant and Lard after the shooting. Yancy and Lard contradicted one another in important ways, although both testified that Yancy and the defendant had had a violent dispute over money in the weeks leading up to the murder. No other evidence connected the defendant to the crime or confirmed that he had ever been at the scene, and no murder weapon was ever recovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">Yancy was a paid informant;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> he had been compensated for his assistance in a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) inquiry into Pass\u2019s murder and a suspected criminal enterprise involving the defendant. This fact was made clear in a pretrial hearing, during which the prosecutor<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> specifically called the investigation\u2019s FBI task force leader and informant coordinator, Special Agent Dan Harris, to address informant compensation in the case. Harris testified that Yancy was paid for his cooperation relating to \u201cthe Larry Pass <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>homicide [,] which was information against Mr. Lard and Mr. Smith [the defendant].\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">At trial, however, the fact and extent of Yancy\u2019s participation in the investigation that lead to the prosecution of the defendant and the compensation Yancy received for it was never made known to the jury. On the contrary, Yancy testified that he was not paid for his cooperation in relation to \u201cthis case,\u201d i.e., the prosecution of the defendant for Pass\u2019s murder. The topic first arose during direct examination, during which Yancy admitted in response to the prosecutor\u2019s question that he had been \u201cpaid by a federal agency for [his] cooperation.\u201d Neither the prosecutor\u2019s question nor Yancy\u2019s answer tied his cooperation to his involvement in the investigation of the defendant as the prime suspect in Pass\u2019s murder. In order to avoid linking Yancy\u2019s compensated cooperation to the investigation and prosecution of the defendant, the prosecutor carefully limited her subsequent questions to whether he was specifically paid for the testimony he was giving, which Yancy denied.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> By itself, such cautious presen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>tation of testimony might not have been problematic because the prosecution was careful not to elicit outright false testimony. But then Yancy took this denial further during cross-examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-4\"><em>[Defense Counsel]: </em>Do you deny \u2014 first of all, it sounds like you agreed that you were paid $4,500 for <em>cooperating </em>with law enforcement, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-5\"><em>[Yancy]: </em>Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-6\"><em>[Defense Counsel]: </em>But you deny that it was wdth regards to this case, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-7\">[fancy]: Correct. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b703-8\">The prosecutor revisited the topic during redirect examination, again limiting her question to whether Yancy had been paid for his \u201ctestimony\u2019 in particular. Yancy again denied being compensated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-9\"><em>[Prosecutor]: </em>Okay, and just so we\u2019re clear, you were not paid to testify in this case, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-10\"><em>[Yancy]: </em>Correct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b704-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>Four times, then, Yancy denied having been paid in connection with the defendant\u2019s case\u2014specifically, that he had not been compensated for his testimony at the defendant\u2019s trial and also that he had not been otherwise compensated for \u201ccooperating\u201d \u201cwith regards to this case.\u201d Clearly, the jury could have interpreted this statement to indicate that Yancy had <em>never </em>been paid for his involvement with the investigation of the Pass homicide, not merely that the Genesee County Prosecuting Attorney\u2019s office had not compensated him for \u201ctestimony\u201d or cooperation with the defendant\u2019s formal prosecution. The latter point might have been true; the former point was plainly misleading and likely untrue, as the prosecutor well knew, having elicited Harris\u2019s testimony at the pretrial hearing. This former point, however, was never corrected or clarified at trial, nor was the true nature or extent of Yancy\u2019s participation or compensation as an informant put before the jury. Rather, the prosecutor exploited the potential confusion Yancy\u2019s testimony created by reminding the jury of Yancy\u2019s denials during closing argument, cementing the false notion that Yancy had only been paid for his cooperation in <em>other cases, </em>and attempting to advance his credibility as a result of that fact:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-4\">Mark Yancy was here, ladies and gentlemen, and he talked to you about [sic] he wasn\u2019t charged in this homicide, and that he admitted he was in the house at the time of the homicide, and that he got the cocaine, and gave it to Lard and the defendant. <em>He told you he did not get consideration on this case for testifying, that he got consideration on other cases that the task force was involved with. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">The jury found the defendant guilty of armed robbery and felony murder, but acquitted him of the other charges. On June 30, 2011, the defendant was sentenced as a fourth-offense habitual offender to life in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>prison for the murder conviction and to 20 years, 10 months to 35 years for the armed-robbery conviction. The defendant appealed and, among other issues, argued that the prosecution\u2019s failure to correct Yancas false testimony violated his right to due process and denied him a fair trial. The Court of Appeals affirmed his convictions because it was unpersuaded that the failure to correct Yancy\u2019s false testimony made a difference in the jury\u2019s estimation of his credibility. <em>People v Smith, </em>unpublished opinion per curiam of the Court of Appeals, issued October 29, 2013 (Docket No. 304935), p 5. The defendant then sought this Court\u2019s review, and we granted leave to appeal.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">II. LEGAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">A due process violation presents a constitutional question that this Court reviews de novo. <em>People v Wilder, </em>485 Mich 35, 40; 780 NW2d 265 (2010). It is inconsistent with due process when the prosecution allows false testimony from a state\u2019s witness to stand uncorrected. <em>Napue, </em>360 US at 269; see also <em>People v Wiese, </em>425 Mich 448, 453-454; 389 NW2d 866 (1986); <em>Giglio v United States, </em>405 US 150, 153; 92 S Ct 763; 31 L Ed 2d 104 (1972). It is well established that \u201ca State may not knowingly use false evidence, including <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>false testimony, to obtain a tainted conviction....\" <em>Napue, </em>360 US at 269. Indeed, the prosecution has an affirmative duty to correct false testimony, and this duty specifically applies when the testimony concerns remuneration for a witness\u2019s cooperation. See <em>Giglio, </em>405 US at 154-155; <em>Wiese, </em>425 Mich at 455-456. The responsibility \u201cdoes not cease to apply merely because the false testimony goes only to the credibility of the witness.\u201d <em>Napue, </em>360 US at 269. Nor is the blameworthiness of the prosecutor relevant. <em>Smith v Phillips, </em>455 US 209, 220 n 10; 102 S Ct 940; 71 L Ed 2d 78 (1982). Rather, while \u201cnot every contradiction is material\u201d and the prosecutor need not correct every instance of mistaken or inaccurate testimony, <em>United States v Martin, </em>59 F3d 767, 770 (CA 8, 1995), it is the <em>effect </em>of a prosecutor\u2019s failure to correct false testimony that \u201cis the crucial inquiry for due process purposes,\u201d <em>Smith, </em>455 US at 220 n 10. A prosecutor\u2019s capitalizing on the false testimony, however, is of particular concern because it \u201creinforce [s] the deception of the use of false testimony and thereby contribute [s] to the deprivation of due process.\u201d <em>DeMarco v United States, </em>928 F2d 1074, 1077 (CA 11, 1991); see <em>Jenkins v Artuz, </em>294 F3d 284, 294-295 (CA 2, 2002) (stating that the prosecutor\u2019s promotion of the false testimony at summation \u201cplainly sharpened the prejudice,\u201d \u201c \u2018ha[d] rio place in the administration of justice [,] and should neither be permitted nor rewarded\u2019 \u201d) (citations and quotation marks omitted); <em>Mills v Scully, </em>826 F2d 1192, 1195 (CA 2, 1987) (\u201c[Tjhere may be a deprivation of due process if the prosecutor reinforces the deception by capitalizing on it in closing argument. . . .\u201d). Anew trial is required if the uncorrected false testimony \u201ccould... in any reasonable likelihood have affected the judgment of the jury.\u201d <em>Napue, </em>360 US at 271-272; see also <em>Giglio, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>405 US at 154. Furthermore, as one federal circuit court of appeals has stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-6\">Regardless of the lack of intent to lie on the part of the witness, <em>Giglio </em>and <em>Napue </em>require that the prosecutor apprise the court when he knows that his witness is giving testimony that is substantially misleading. This is not to say that the prosecutor must play the role of defense counsel, and ferret out ambiguities in his witness\u2019s responses on cross-examination. However, when it should be obvious to the Government that the witness\u2019 answer, although made in good faith, is untrue, the Government\u2019s obligation to correct that statement is as compelling as it is in a situation where the Government knows that the witness is intentionally committing perjury. <em>[United States v Harris, </em>498 F2d 1164, 1169 (CA 3, 1974).][<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b708-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>III. APPLICATION</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">A. FAILURE TO CORRECT TESTIMONY</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">As the Court of Appeals correctly observed, Yancy\u2019s trial testimony undoubtedly left the impression that he received no payment of any kind for his participation in this case, either for his testimony or for his prior cooperation that was the necessary condition to his testimony. The overall impression conveyed was false. Whether Yancy understood why or for what he had been compensated, the prosecutor knew that Agent Harris had given uncontroverted pretrial testimony that Yancy was compensated for information central to the formal prosecution of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">Instead of rectifying this false impression regarding Yancy\u2019s involvement, the prosecutor capitalized on and exploited it. Though well aware of Harris\u2019s testimony and the fact of Yancy\u2019s compensation, the prosecutor never took any steps to correct or explain Yancy\u2019s testimony. Rather, the prosecutor carefully limited her questioning of Yancy to the fact that he had been paid for cooperating with law enforcement, while never seeking to clarify that Yancy had been compensated for his cooperation in the investigation of the defendant. To the contrary, the prosecutor further distanced Yancy from the latter by emphasizing that any payment for his cooperation came from a \u201cfederal agency\u201d and, impliedly, had nothing to do with the pending charges against the defendant. The prosecutor\u2019s follow-up questions built on this obfuscation; after leaving Yan-cy\u2019s testimony regarding his cooperation with law enforcement ambiguous and untethered to the defendant\u2019s case, the prosecutor pivoted directly to the more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>limited claim that Yancy specifically had not been paid to <em>testify </em>at trial. And when Yancy specifically denied during cross-examination that he had been compensated in connection with the investigation of the defendant, the prosecutor again did nothing to correct it.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>She instead used Yancy\u2019s general claims of noncompen-sation to her advantage in closing, urging the jury to credit his story because \u201c[h]e told you he did not get consideration on this case for testifying, that he got consideration on <em>other cases </em>that the task force was involved with.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">Capitalizing on Yancy\u2019s testimony that he had no paid involvement in the defendant\u2019s case is inconsistent with a prosecutor\u2019s duty to correct false testimony.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Indeed, the prosecutor sought to transform <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>testimony that might have been merely confusing on its own into an outright falsity. Irrespective of the veracity of Yancy\u2019s claim that he had not been paid to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>\u201ctestify,\u201d the prosecutor should not have capitalized on Yancy\u2019s testimony after Yancy had confusingly denied being paid for cooperating in \u201cthis case.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Napue, </em>360 US at 269. The prosecutor\u2019s repeated emphasis on Yancy\u2019s lack of compensation for \u201ctestifying\u201d and her comments at closing argument enhanced the misleading impression that Yancy was a totally independent witness. Her actions served to underscore the jury\u2019s false impression that because Yancy had not been paid to \u201ctestify,\u201d he had no questionable incentive for his participation in this case.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Simply put, the prosecutor sought to benefit from the problematic testimony and use it to her advantage. This prosecutorial conduct does not comport with due process.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> See <em>DeMarco, </em>928 F2d at 1077; <em>Jenkins, </em>294 F3d at 294-295.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>B. ERROR AFFECTING THE JUDGMENT OF THE JURY</p>\n<p id=\"b713-4\">Whatever Yancy may have believed about the truth of his testimony, we conclude both that it conveyed a serious misimpression about the nature of his involvement in the case and that the prosecutor\u2019s exploitation of that testimony violated the defendant\u2019s right to due process. For this reason, we disagree with the Court of Appeals that this violation does not warrant relief. Rather, in light of the effect that Yancy\u2019s uncorrected testimony had on his credibility and the role that credibility played in securing the defendant\u2019s convictions, we conclude that there is a \u201creasonable likelihood\u201d that the false impression resulting from the prosecutor\u2019s exploitation of the testimony affected the judgment of the jury. <em>Napue, </em>360 US at 271. Accordingly, the defendant is entitled to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">As noted, there was no physical evidence tying the defendant to the crime. No murder weapon was ever recovered, the defendant\u2019s fingerprints were not found at the scene, and no other physical evidence confirmed that he had ever been at Pass\u2019s house. The defendant was convicted solely on the testimony of Lard and Yancy, two witnesses with significant credibility issues. As the jury was made aware, Lard was testifying pursuant to a favorable plea agreement for his role in the crime,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>his testimony at trial proved inconsistent not only with Yancy\u2019s version of events, but with his own pretrial account.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">Yancy\u2019s account of the crime was also riddled with inconsistencies<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and did not otherwise cast him in a particularly favorable light. First, while Yancy admitted at trial that he and the victim \u201chad a kind of personal bond,\u201d he also admitted that he did not call an ambulance or the police while the victim was \u201cgurgling off his blood\u201d on the floor after being shot, instead leaving the house with the defendant and Lard to go share some of the victim\u2019s cocaine. Yancy acknowledged that he then promptly disappeared from town for approximately a year. Furthermore, Yancy admitted, and Lard confirmed, that Yancy and the defendant had \u201ca little beef going on\u201d at the time of the murder, arising from a violent dispute over money a few weeks earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>There was, therefore, a basis for skepticism about both Lard and Yancy. What is most significant for our assessment, however, is that, as far as the jury knew, Yancy was uniquely credible in one respect: he was the sole lay witness who did not directly benefit from his participation in the case. Unlike Lard, he was not facing charges in connection with Pass\u2019s murder, and according to his testimony, he had not been compensated for testifying and had no paid connection with the defendant\u2019s case. Of course, Yancy did receive at least one known direct benefit for his participation in the case\u2014 financial compensation. But the prosecutor exploited the false impression to the contrary, urging the jury to believe Yancy\u2014and convict the defendant\u2014because of it. Given that the prosecution\u2019s case hinged entirely on the jury\u2019s credibility assessment of Lard and Yancy, this emphasis on the one (albeit false) indication of the difference in trustworthiness between them is unsurprising. For the same reason, however, we cannot overlook its prejudicial effect. See <em>Wiese, </em>425 Mich at 456 (concluding, in a case that \u201cdepended almost entirely on [the falsely testifying witness\u2019s] testimony,\u201d that the use of the false testimony and the defendant\u2019s resulting inability to properly question the witness\u2019s credibility \u201creasonably could have affected the judgment of the jury\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">In concluding that this prejudice was too insignificant to warrant relief, the Court of Appeals stressed that the impression that he had not been compensated could not have \u201cbolstered\u201d the \u201cfairly dreadful state of Yancy\u2019s credibility. .. .\u201d <em>Smith, </em>unpub op at 5. We agree that Yancy lacked credibility in a number of respects unrelated to his role as a paid informant. But we disagree with the Court of Appeals that the <em>impossibility </em>of raising Yancy\u2019s credibility from an already \u201cdreadful state\u201d is an appropriate way to frame the critical issue. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>Instead, the question is what effect would likely have resulted if the jury had understood that Yancy was compensated for his information against the defendant. In our view, this unique additional impeachment evidence was not cumulative or immaterial. See Napue, 360 US at 270 (\u201c[W]e do not believe that the fact that the jury was apprised of other grounds for believing that the witness . .. may have had an interest in testifying against [the defendant] turned what was otherwise a tainted trial into a fair one.\u201d); <em>Reynoso v Giurbino, </em>462 F3d 1099, 1117 (CA 9, 2006) (\u201cUnlike the other evidence used to impeach the eyewitnesses ... such as inconsistent statements and general attacks on their credibility, evidence of their financial motives would have established a real incentive to lie, explaining <em>why </em>their testimony may have been fabricated.\u201d). Rather, there is good reason to believe that if the jury had been made aware that Yancy was compensated for his cooperation, the prosecution would have had a more difficult task persuading the jury that he should be believed.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">Put simply, the \u201cdreadful state\u201d ofYancy\u2019s credibility would have been even more dreadful had the jury learned that he was paid for his information against the defendant. And contrary to the Court of Appeals\u2019 suggestion, the prejudice from the prosecutor\u2019s exploitation of Yancy\u2019s potentially misleading testimony cannot be discounted simply because the jury had other reasons to disbelieve Yancy. Indeed, this case demonstrates the opposite to be true. Presented with a witness who was revealed to be a regular drug user, to have been in a dispute with the defendant about money, to have taken the victim\u2019s drugs, to have left the victim \u201cgurgling off his blood\u201d on the floor, and to have then left town for a year, the jury was more likely to have viewed the false inference that Yancy was not compensated at all for his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>involvement as the most significant basis for crediting his testimony against the defendant.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">Due process required that the jury be accurately apprised of the incentives underlying the testimony of this critical witness, and plainly that the prosecution not exploit any confusion relating to this critical topic. See <em>United States v Cervantes-Pacheco, </em>826 F2d 310, 315 (CA 5, 1987) (\u201cAs in the case of the witness who has been promised a reduced sentence, <em>it is up to the jury </em>to evaluate the credibility of the compensated witness.\u201d) (emphasis added). Given the centrality of Yancy\u2019s credibility to the prosecution\u2019s case and the dearth of other evidence supporting the defendant\u2019s convictions, we hold that there was a reasonable likelihood that the prosecutor\u2019s exploitation of Yancy\u2019s misleading testimony affected the judgment of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b717-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the defendant is entitled to a new trial. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals in part, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>vacate the defendant\u2019s convictions, and remand this case for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b718-6\">Young, C.J., and Markman and Viviano, JJ., and BERNSTEIN, J.

The prosecutor brought the witness\u2019s false testimony to the attention of the court and defense counsel a day after the testimony was given but still during the government\u2019s case-in-chief and offered to stipulate it. <em>Id. </em>at 1167.

The dissent overlooks this important difference, and conflates the distinct prosecutorial duties to disclose exculpatory information, see <em>Brady v Maryland, </em>373 US 83, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>87; 83 S Ct 1194; 10 L Ed 2d 215 (1963), and to refrain from using false or misleading testimony to obtain a conviction, see <em>Napue, </em>360 US at 269. See note 8 of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b709-6\"> The obligation to avoid presenting false or misleading testimony of its own witness begins and ends with the prosecution and is prudent in the unique <em>Napue </em>context because <em>Napue </em>requires the prosecution\u2019s knowledge of the false or misleading testimony of its own witnesses. <em>Napue, </em>360 US at 269. While we do not disagree that a defendant can waive a claim of error under <em>Napue, </em>we do not share the dissent\u2019s view that there was waiver in this case. First, we disagree with the dissent that the record reveals any strategy by defense counsel to keep the impeaching information from the jury. Given that we see no strategy here, the dissent\u2019s reference to cases finding waiver when counsel strategically elected not to address a government witness\u2019s false testimony is beside the point. We note, however, that we do not read all the cases the dissent cites in support of this general proposition as relevant. Two did not involve false testimony about a witness\u2019s cooperation agreement, see <em>Beltran v Cockrell, </em>294 F3d 730, 735 (CA 5, 2002) (observing that the defendant prevented the prosecution from clarifying the allegedly false testimony that the defendant was the only person identified as the assailant); <em>United States v Decker, </em>543 F2d 1102, 1105 (CA 5, 1976) (noting that any error from the witness\u2019s false statements about his attorney\u2019s presence at his cooperation meeting were harmless), and in another, the court held that it was not clear that there was any cooperation agreement with the witness at all, see <em>United States v Meinster, </em>619 F2d 1041, 1045 (CA 4, 1980) (\u201cNothing was promised in exchange for [the witness\u2019s] testimony in this case.\u201d). Importantly, however, when a prosecutor has capitalized on the false or misleading evidence, the waiver rule is more nuanced. See <em>Jenkins, </em>294 F3d at 296 (concluding that there was no waiver because \u201cthe prosecutor\u2019s actions cannot be overlooked on the ground that [defense] counsel did not continue to seek to gain an admission from [the witness] as to the plea agreement\u201d); <em>Barham, </em>595 F2d at 243 n 17 (concluding that there was no waiver because the prosecutor\u2019s \u201cmisleading questions .. . reinforced the deception\u201d); <em>United States v Sanfilippo, </em>564 F2d 176, 178-179 (CA 5, 1977) (concluding that there was no waiver when the prosecutor failed to correct and subsequently capitalized on the false testimony); <em>De-Marco, </em>928 F2d at 1077 (concluding that there was no waiver when the prosecution\u2019s capitalizing on the testimony \u201ccontributed to the deprivation of due process\u201d). Therefore, even if, as the dissent argues, counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>had a conscious strategy to keep the true nature of Yancy\u2019s compensation from the jury, it is far from clear whether that would have led to a waiver in this case, given that the prosecutor capitalized on the misleading evidence in her summation to the jury. In any event, what precise role counsel\u2019s effectiveness might play in determining the reviewability of a <em>Napue </em>complaint on appeal is not one we need reach today, since the prosecution has never argued in the course of this appeal that the defendant waived this <em>Napue </em>objection. See <em>People v McGraw, </em>484 Mich 120, 131 n 36; 771 NW2d 655 (2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b710-12\"> The dissent insists that the prosecution\u2019s duty to correct false testimony under <em>Napue, </em>360 US at 269, must be coupled with the separate, though often overlapping, duty to disclose exculpatory information under <em>Brady, </em>373 US at 87. The dissent consequently asserts that \u201c[i]t is the secreting of evidence that is offensive to due process.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 499. We agree that the secreting of evidence violates due process, but so too does a prosecutor\u2019s exploitation of false testimony by a state witness to gain a conviction, whether done together with a failure to disclose or not. In many cases, dereliction of both duties happens in tandem when a witness falsely testifies about an undisclosed cooperation agreement. But they need not happen together, and when they do not, the prosecution\u2019s <em>Napue </em>duty is not mitigated because it complied with its <em>Brady </em>duty. See <em>Jenkins, </em>294 F3d at 296; <em>Sanfilippo, </em>564 F2d at 178-179; <em>DeMarco, </em>928 F2d at 1076-1077; <em>Belmontes v Brown, </em>414 F3d 1094, 1115 (CA 9, 2005) (\u201cWhether defense counsel is aware of the falsity of the statement is beside the point.... The prosecutor\u2019s duty to correct false testimony arises, not simply out of a duty of fairness to the defendant, but out of the free standing constitutional duty of the State and its representatives to protect the system against false testimony.\u201d), rev\u2019d on other grounds sub nom <em>Ayers v Belmontes, </em>549 US 7; 127 S Ct 469; 166 L Ed 2d 334 (2006) (citations and quotation marks omitted). The dissent\u2019s argument to the contrary is not supported by the authority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>it cites. <em>Routly v Singletary, </em>33 F3d 1279 (CA 11, 1994), for example, does not address the idea that all <em>Napue </em>violations must accompany <em>Brady </em>violations. Rather, <em>Routly </em>involved unsuccessful and overlapping <em>Brady </em>and <em>Napue </em>claims, but each was denied because the prosecution had complied with each duty. <em>Id. </em>at 1284-1287.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">Furthermore, the <em>post-Sanfllippo </em>cases in the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit that the dissent cites certainly did not distinguish Sanfllippo\u2019s relevance in cases in which, as here, the prosecutor capitalized on a freestanding <em>Napue </em>error. Compare <em>Sanfilippo, </em>564 F2d at 178-179 (concluding that there was no waiver when the prosecutor failed to correct and subsequently capitalized on the false testimony), with <em>Beltran, </em>294 F3d at 736-737 (concluding that <em>Sanfll-ippo </em>was inapposite because the prosecution had not \u201cused the false testimony consciously allowed by the defense as part of a legal strategy\u2019), and <em>United States v Antone, </em>603 F2d 566, 570-571 (CA 5, 1979) (concluding that <em>Sanfllippo </em>was inapposite because it involved false testimony of \u201cfar more serious impact,\u201d i.e., relating to the conditions of the witness\u2019s plea deal for his testimony, while <em>Antone </em>simply involved an arrangement to have legal counsel appointed for the witness). And indeed, at least one <em>post-Sanfllippo </em>case from the Fifth Circuit has affirmed Sanfllippo\u2019s rule that a prosecutor\u2019s capitalizing on false testimony might result in a due process deprivation even when the defense can be charged with knowledge of the evidence. See <em>Barham, </em>595 F2d at 243 (stating that the prosecutor\u2019s \u201cmisleading questions .. . reinforced the deception\u201d and \u201cundermine [d] the Government\u2019s argument that defense counsel waived the false evidence issue\u201d by virtue of his knowledge of the falsity).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-8\">There is no question that the prosecution complied with its <em>Brady </em>obligation regarding Yancy\u2019s compensation for his cooperation. Yet when Yancy\u2019s trial testimony did not reflect the true nature of his agreement, instead of clarifying, the prosecutor exploited the testimony to her advantage. This due process error stands apart from a failure to disclose. See <em>Jenkins, </em>294 F3d at 296 (stating that \u201cthe prosecutor\u2019s actions cannot be overlooked\u201d on the ground that defense counsel knew about and \u201cdid not continue to seek to gain an admission from [the witness] as to [his] plea agreement\u201d); <em>Napue, </em>360 US at 269 (stating that the duty to correct false evidence arises \u201cwhen it appears\u201d). The dissent\u2019s understanding that any <em>Napue </em>violation is only meaningful when coupled with a <em>Brady </em>violation simply misunderstands the separate duties.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b712-6\"> Indeed, it would be a much closer question if the prosecutor had not sought to create a false impression at closing argument. But the question of whether, in isolation, Yancy\u2019s uncorrected or unclarified cross-examination testimony would justify reversal is not before us in this case, and we decline to address it as though it had been presented in that fashion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b712-7\"> We note that the prosecutor\u2019s duty to correct false or misleading testimony particularly arises in those instances in which law enforcement has directly participated in the subject matter of the testimony. Such participation would typically arise for purposes of this duty in the context of plea negotiations or other agreements for cooperation and testimony involving the prosecutor\u2019s office and others. Such participation may also arise when, as here, the prosecutor has direct knowledge of an agreement for cooperation between law enforcement and other persons concerning the particular case at hand.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b712-8\"> We disagree with the dissent that we \u201cnow holdO prosecutors to the unacceptably high and extraordinarily ambiguous standard of having to correct every instance of mistaken, inaccurate, or incomplete testimony or risk the possibility that every possible or perceived contradiction will be rendered material.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 495. We respectfully submit that the dissent has mischaracterized and broadened the proper understanding of our opinion. As we emphasize above, a prosecutor need not correct every instance of mistaken or inaccurate testimony, <em>Martin, </em>59 F3d at 770, nor must he or she \u201cplay the role of defense counsel, and ferret out ambiguities in [the] witness\u2019s responses on cross-examination,\u201d <em>Harris, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>498 F2d at 1169. Indeed, it is on the basis of the prosecutor\u2019s exploitative tactics in this case that we conclude that she had and then breached her duty to correct the false impression she created. Accordingly, to be absolutely clear, we do not hold today that the prosecutor has a limitless obligation to correct every instance of false or misleading testimony, regardless of its subject matter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b713-7\"> Lard agreed to testify after spending approximately two years in jail awaiting trial for his part in Pass\u2019s murder.

The Court of Appeals acknowledged that the circuit court did not correctly apply the <em>Barker v Wingo</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark><em> </em>balancing test to assess defendant\u2019s speedy-trial claim after his trial was delayed for 41 months.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Specifically, the circuit court did not \u201cfollow [] the rule that after a delay of 18 months, prejudice is presumed,\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and the Court of Appeals likewise did not properly examine the extent to which the circuit court\u2019s analysis was influenced by its failure to require the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>prosecution to rebut the presumption of prejudice. I would therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals, vacate defendant\u2019s convictions, and remand this case to a new judge in the Genesee Circuit Court to consider whether the prosecution overcame the presumption of prejudice to defendant\u2019s person and defense.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> If the presumption was overcome, a new trial is warranted on the basis of the reasoning provided in the majority opinion.

On appeal almost 25 months after defendant\u2019s first motion for a speedy trial, the Court of Appeals recognized that the circuit court had misunderstood the <em>Barker </em>prejudice prong, observing that \u201cirrespective of whether defendant or the prosecution is more at \u2018fault\u2019 for the 41-month delay here, the simple fact is that the delay <em>was </em>41 months, and consequently the burden is on the prosecution to show that there was no prejudice.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> However, the Court of Appeals found no error in the circuit court\u2019s independent inquiry into prejudice because its independent inquiry was not tainted by its misapprehension of the law.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">Contrary to the Court of Appeals\u2019 conclusion, the circuit court\u2019s prejudice inquiry <em>was </em>tainted by its misapprehension of applicable law.

The majority concludes that reversal of defendant\u2019s felony-murder and armed-robbery convictions is required because the prosecutor failed to meet her duty to correct \u201csubstantially misleading, if not false,\u201d testimony from Mark Yancy regarding the compensation paid to him by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for information and cooperation. The objection to the prosecutor\u2019s conduct is premised in the notion that the \u201cState may not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>knowingly use false evidence, including false testimony, to obtain a tainted conviction. . . <em>Ante </em>at 475-476 (quotation marks and citation omitted). I agree with this fundamental proposition, and imagine that no one denies it. But today the majority has turned this rudimentary constitutional principle into a new requirement that the prosecutor not just elicit truthful testimony on direct examination, but also elicit complete testimony, fully disclosing all the facts and circumstances of how that witness came to testify. Further, the majority imposes an additional duty on the prosecutor to correct a defense attorney\u2019s mischar-acterized questions made during cross-examination of a state\u2019s witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">The record is clear that Yancy admitted being paid by the FBI for his cooperation. Nonetheless, despite the prosecutor\u2019s having elicited testimony from Yancy that he had been paid for his cooperation, the majority vacates defendant\u2019s convictions because the prosecutor did not make it absolutely clear to the jury that the FBI paid Yancy for his cooperation in the government\u2019s case against defendant. I respectfully dissent because I fear the majority now holds prosecutors to the unacceptably high and extraordinarily ambiguous standard of having to correct every instance of mistaken, inaccurate, or incomplete testimony or risk the possibility that every possible or perceived contradiction will be rendered material.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b726-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>The majority\u2019s claim of error is predicated on the broad proposition \u201cthat deliberate deception of a court and jurors by the presentation of known false evidence is incompatible with \u2018rudimentary demands of justice.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Along these lines, a state may not knowingly use false evidence, including false testimony, or solicit false evidence or testimony and allow it to go uncorrected when it appears, to obtain a tainted conviction.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This Court has recognized that \u201c[t]he prosecution\u2019s duty to correct the false testimony of a state witness arises \u2018when [the false testimony] appears.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\">Each of these principles is sound when one understands how they have been developed and applied. In each case enunciating these principles, neither defense counsel nor the trial court was aware that the state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>had agreed to compensate witnesses for their testimony because the prosecution did not disclose the agreements. This, however, is not a case in which the prosecutor kept secret the compensation the FBI paid to Yancy for his cooperation. Rather, the existence and extent of Yancy\u2019s relationship with the government and the details regarding the compensation paid to Yancy were fully disclosed and known not only to the prosecutor, but also to defense counsel and the trial court long before trial commenced. For this reason, I conclude that the evidence the majority finds to be false or \u201csubstantially misleading\u201d is better characterized as incomplete testimony. Accordingly, I conclude that the prosecutor did not commit an error by failing to clarify the evidence in the manner espoused by the majority. Similarly, I do not conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument was an improper exploitation of misleading testimony. To the extent that the prosecutor\u2019s actions constituted error, that error was either extinguished by defendant\u2019s waiver, forfeited for lack of preservation, or harmless. I would affirm defendant\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-4\">I. THE SUPREME COURT CASES RELIED ON BY THE MAJORITY ARE DISTINGUISHABLE</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">The majority relies principally on <em>Napue v Illinois, </em>360 US 264, 271-272; 79 S Ct 1173; 3 L Ed 2d 1217 (1959), <em>Giglio v United States, </em>405 US 150, 154; 92 S Ct 763; 31 L Ed 2d 104 (1972), and <em>People v Wiese, </em>425 Mich 448, 453-454; 389 NW2d 866 (1986), to support the proposition that reversal is required in this case. All these cases involved witnesses who denied under oath receiving of any remuneration from the government in exchange for their testimony. It is significant, in my view, that in each case the denial of remunera<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>tion was clearly and patently false and, more importantly, that this falsity was known only by the prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">Unlike the key prosecution witnesses in <em>Napue, Giglio, </em>and <em>Wiese, </em>Yancy admitted receiving compensation for his cooperation with the FBI. Moreover, as distinguished from <em>Napue, Giglio, </em>and <em>Wiese, </em>in the instant case it was not a secret that Yancy received compensation from the FBI in exchange for his cooperation. In stark contrast to <em>Napue, Giglio, </em>and <em>Wiese, </em>here there was a pretrial proceeding held for the benefit of defense counsel<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> during which the prosecution presented FBI Special Agent Dan Harris, who was charged with the responsibility of compensating informants. Defense counsel participated in this hearing, which was presided over by the trial court. During the hearing it was fully disclosed that Yancy had received $4,000 for information related to the Pierson Hood gang and for information that led to the charges against defendant.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b729-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>The fact that the trial court and defense counsel were made aware before trial of the consideration given Yancy for his cooperation with the FBI materially distinguishes this case from <em>Napue, Giglio, </em>and <em>Wiese. </em>This disclosure is fundamental. It is the secreting of evidence that is offensive to due process.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> As <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>noted in <em>Giglio, </em>\u201cWhen the \u2018reliability of a given witness may well be determinative of guilt or innocence,\u2019 <em>nondisclosure of evidence affecting credibility </em>falls within this general rule.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> If disclosure of evidence affecting credibility is timely made, the witness\u2019s credibility should be left to the adversarial process. Indeed, \u201c[t]he very premise of our adversary system of criminal justice is that partisan advocacy on both sides of a case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>will best promote the ultimate objective that the guilty be convicted and the innocent go free.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Our adversarial system of justice \u201cis premised on the well-tested principle that truth\u2014as well as fairness\u2014is best discovered by powerful statements on both sides of the question.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Under our adversarial system, however, each party bears the responsibility for ensuring that its positions are vigorously and properly advocated.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> And \u201c[a]lthough the judge plays a vital role in the trial of a criminal case, counsel for the parties are also essential components\u201d because \u201c[t]hey too share in the cause of justice.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">In cases in which the defendant claims that the prosecution has left unchecked questionable testimony from a witness, a reviewing court must assess whether the evidence was truly false and material to the proceedings or merely inaccurate, incomplete, or otherwise vague or ambiguous such that the discrepancy is immaterial.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> As observed by the majority, \u201cit is the <em>effect </em>of a prosecutor\u2019s failure to correct false testimony that \u2018is the crucial inquiry for due process purposes.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> If the evidence in question was disclosed to the defense in a timely manner, this disclosure should weigh in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>favor of a finding of immateriality. When all parties to the litigation are aware of the material facts, the adversarial process will separate the wheat from the chaff, leaving all material and pertinent information before the jury.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">II. THE ALLEGED \u201cSUBSTANTIALLY MISLEADING\u201d EVIDENCE PRESENTED BY THE PROSECUTOR WAS NOT ONLY DISCLOSED, IT WAS AT MOST INCOMPLETE AND THEREFORE IMMATERIAL</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">Examination of the testimony elicited by the prosecutor reveals no patent falsity. The majority takes issue with two questions<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> from the prosecutor during Yancy\u2019s direct examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-7\">[Prosecutor]: Now, you\u2019ve been paid by a federal agency for cooperation. Is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-8\"><em>\\Yancy\\: </em>Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAzp\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>[Prosecutor]: Were you paid for your testimony in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-4\"><em>[Yancy]: </em>No.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">The majority does not allege that either question and its respective response, taken individually, constituted the solicitation of false or misleading evidence. This is clearly because the responses to both questions are true. Yancy was paid for his cooperation, but he was not paid for his testimony. At most the majority takes issue with the prosecutor\u2019s use of the phrase \u201cfederal agency,\u201d framing that language as clear evidence the prosecutor purposefully attempted to distance the witness from the defendant and purposefully obfuscated the fact that Yancy had been compensated for information provided to the FBI. The majority uses innuendo and isolated phrases such as \u201cfederal agency\u201d to somehow determine that \u201c[t]he overall impression [with regard to Yancy\u2019s compensation] conveyed was false.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">In reality, any misdirection with regard to the compensation paid by the FBI to Yancy was created not by the prosecutor but by defense counsel during Yancy\u2019s cross-examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-7\"><em>[Defense Counsel]: </em>Do you deny \u2014 first of all, it sounds like you agreed that you were paid $4,500 for cooperating with law enforcement, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-8\"><em>\\Yancy]: </em>Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-9\"><em>[Defense Counsel]: </em>But you deny that it was with regards to this case, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-10\"><em>\\Yancy]: </em>Correct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b733-11\">On the basis of this response, the majority claims that Yancy denied that he was compensated for his \u201ccooperation with the defendant\u2019s formal prosecution.\u201d But Yancy was not asked whether he was compensated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>for his cooperation in the Pass murder investigation; he was asked whether he was compensated \u201cwith regards to this case.\u201d Yancy might well have believed that his compensation was not \u201cwith regards to this case,\u201d but was instead for his cooperation in the Pier-son Hood gang case. Further, Yancy had just been asked if he had been paid for his testimony in this case. It would be reasonable for Yancy to assume that defense counsel was referring to his specific testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">Admittedly, neither the prosecutor nor defense counsel made this clarification. Instead, the prosecutor again asked Yancy to confirm that the compensation he received was not for his trial testimony. It is the prosecutor\u2019s failure to clarify the distinction between compensation for information and compensation for testimony\u2014a confusion brought on by defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination\u2014that the majority finds offensive. More specifically, the majority believes that the prosecutor was under a duty to expressly elicit testimony from Yancy that he was compensated for providing information that implicated defendant for the murder. This failure, says the majority, rendered the prosecutor\u2019s examination either false or substantially misleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">If this were a case in which the prosecution alone was aware that Yancy was compensated for information that ultimately led to the charges against defendant, I might well have joined the majority opinion. This is not such a case. Defense counsel was fully aware of the specifics underlying the compensation the FBI paid Yancy. Accordingly, defense counsel had in his arsenal all the information necessary to cross-examine Yancy with regard to the incomplete, albeit truthful, testimony elicited by the prosecutor. Importantly, defense counsel conducted a vigorous and effective cross-examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number><em>[Defense Counsel\\: </em>But it was money, right? Real money, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-4\"><em>[Yancy]: </em>Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-5\"><em>[Defense </em>Counsel]: For cooperating, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-6\">[Yancy]: Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-7\"><em>[Defense </em>Counsel]: With these folks, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-8\"><em>[Yancy]: </em>Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-9\"><em>IDefense Counsel]: </em>And you got some other benefits, too.

Well, are you in prison or jail now?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-12\"><em>[Yancy]: </em>Because I didn\u2019t do nothing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-13\"><em>[Defense </em>Counsel]: That\u2019s not my question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-14\"><em>[Yancy]: </em>No I\u2019m not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-15\"><em>[Defense Counsel]: </em>You\u2019re not in prison or jail now. Okay. You weren\u2019t charged with murder or weapons possession, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-16\"><em>[Yancy]: </em>I didn\u2019t have a weapon, no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-17\"><em>[Defense Counsel]: </em>That\u2019s not my question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-18\"><em>[Yancy]: </em>No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-19\"><em>[Defense Counsel]: </em>Okay. You were not charged with drug charges, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-20\"><em>[Yancy]: </em>No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-21\"><em>[Defense Counsel]: </em>I mean you delivered cocaine in the house, right? You handed it to these guys and then you shared it, so you delivered it or at the least used it, right? Didn\u2019t get charged with any of that stuff, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-22\"><em>[Yancy]: </em>No.[<footnotemark>17</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b736-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>The majority picks and chooses small snippets of testimony to determine that the prosecutor had evil <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>intent to obfuscate the evidence and confuse the jury. This could not be further from the truth. The prosecutor made a timely pretrial disclosure of the evidence affecting Yancy\u2019s credibility. The prosecutor elicited only true testimony from Yancy. Defense counsel had ample opportunity for a vigorous cross-examination with full knowledge that Yancy had indeed been paid money by the FBI for information that implicated defendant in the murder of Pass. Given this compelling information, I simply cannot conclude that any infirmity in the testimony elicited from Yancy constituted false or substantially misleading evidence sufficient to warrant the reversal of defendant\u2019s convictions. Instead, I would conclude that the testimony under review was at most incomplete and not material to the greater scheme of this criminal trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-4\">III. ANY ALLEGED ERROR IS BARRED BY WAIVER</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">While defense counsel conducted a vigorous cross-examination of Yancy, counsel chose not to clarify Yancy\u2019s testimony with regard to compensation from the FBI. I conclude that explicit disclosure of evidence affecting Yancy\u2019s credibility, coupled with defense counsel\u2019s subsequent failure to raise the specific issue at trial, constituted waiver of the claim at issue in this case.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Significantly, when Yancy denied on cross-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>examination that he was compensated \u201cwith regards to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>this case,\u201d defense counsel did not object, ask for a mistrial, seek a conference outside the presence of the jury, or otherwise ask the court to strike the allegedly false testimony.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Presumably defense counsel viewed Yancy\u2019s testimony as incomplete, vague, and perhaps even evasive, but deemed this testimony best addressed through vigorous cross-examination. And defense counsel in fact conducted a vigorous cross-examination of Yancy, but instead of clarifying Yancy\u2019s testimony with regard to compensation from the FBI, he sought to highlight that Yancy was not paid \u201cwith regards to this case\u201d and impeached Yancy by suggesting that Yancy had received not only \u201c[r]eal money\u201d for cooperating with the FBI, but some additional tacit benefit from the prosecution for his testimony and cooperation. An issue is waived if the defendant intentionally abandons a known right.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> \u201c[W]aiver may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>effected by action of counsel.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Because defense counsel had full knowledge of Yancy\u2019s cooperation and compensation and nonetheless chose to impeach Yancy at trial without mentioning the extent of Yancy\u2019s cooperation with the FBI, defendant has waived this issue on appeal.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b741-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>IV. THE UNPRESERVED ALLEGED ERROR IS FORFEITED</p>\n<p id=\"b741-4\">As discussed, defense counsel and the trial court were fully aware that the FBI had compensated Yancy for his cooperation and information implicating defendant in the murder of Pass. Because there was no objection when Yancy denied being compensated \u201cwith regards to this case,\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> defendant\u2019s constitutional claim is unpreserved and subject to forfeiture.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> \u201cTo avoid forfeiture under the plain error rule, three require<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>ments must be met: 1) error must have occurred, 2) the error was plain, i.e., clear or obvious, 3) and the plain error affected substantial rights.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> \u201cThe third requirement generally requires a showing of prejudice, i.e., that the error affected the outcome of the lower court proceedings.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The defendant has the burden of establishing each of these three elements.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> In this case, defendant has failed to show that any perceived error affected the outcome of the lower-court proceedings. In affirming defendant\u2019s convictions, the Court of Appeals relied heavily on the \u201cfairly dreadful state of Yancy\u2019s credibility\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> to conclude that any error was harmless. The majority believes that the panel\u2019s reliance on Yancy\u2019s dreadful credibility was misplaced because \u201cthe <em>impossibility </em>of raising Yancy\u2019s credibility from an already \u2018dreadful state\u2019 \u201d was not the critical issue. Rather, the majority frames the issue as \u201cwhat effect would likely have resulted if the jury had understood that Yancy was compensated for his information <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>against the defendant.\u201d In this regard, the majority concludes that reversal is required because \u201cthe \u2018dreadful state\u2019 of Yancy\u2019s credibility would have been even more dreadful had the jury learned that he was paid for his information against the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">Of course the jury was certainly entitled to question Yancy\u2019s credibility. He admitted that he was a regular drug user, was in a dispute with defendant over money, took Pass\u2019s drugs (though he gave them to Lard), and left the victim \u201cgurgling off his blood\u201d on the floor (though he testified, \u201cWhat could I do?\u201d and \u201cI thought I was next\u201d), and left town for a year. Even the prosecutor wryly admitted, \u201c[0]ur witnesses aren\u2019t from the Mormon Tabernacle choir. . . .\u201d With that said, \u201c \u2018[i]t is the defendant rather than the Government who bears the burden of persuasion with respect to prejudice.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> But here, defendant here has only shown a <em>possibility </em>that Yancy\u2019s credibility could be further diminished. In other words, it is entirely speculative that this possibility would have affected the outcome in this case. It is just as possible that the jury would have ignored additional impeachment given the then-existing \u201cdreadful state of Yancy\u2019s credibility.\u201d Simply put, the burden is on defendant, and defendant failed to show that any perceived error actually, instead of possibly, affected the outcome of the lower-court proceedings. Accordingly, defendant has not satisfied his burden of establishing plain error that affected his substantial rights and therefore has forfeited this issue on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">V. THE ALLEGED ERROR WAS HARMLESS</p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">MCL 769.26 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>No judgment or verdict shall be set aside or reversed or a new trial be granted by any court of this state in any criminal case, on the ground of misdirection of the jury, or the improper admission or rejection of evidence, or for error as to any matter of pleading or procedure, unless in the opinion of the court, after an examination of the entire cause, it shall affirmatively appear that the error complained of has resulted in a miscarriage of justice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">This statute essentially embodies Michigan\u2019s harmless-error rule.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> \u201c \u2018Simply stated,... reversal is only required if the error was prejudicial. That inquiry focuses on the nature of the error and assesses its effect in light of the weight and strength of the untainted evidence.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">According to the majority, the alleged error prejudiced defendant because the prosecutor bolstered Yan-cy\u2019s credibility by arguing that he had only been paid for his cooperation in other cases:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-6\">Mark Yancy was here, ladies and gentlemen, and he talked to you about [sic] he wasn\u2019t charged in this homicide, and that he admitted he was in the house at the time of the homicide, and that he got the cocaine, and gave it to Lard and the defendant. He told you he did not get consideration on this case for testifying, that he got consideration on other cases that the task force was involved with.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">No objection was made to the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument. Further, this argument is consistent with the record evidence from Flint police officer Shawn Ellis, who testified without objection that Yancy was not paid for his testimony and had \u201ccooperated on other investigations with task force officers.\u201d In any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>event, reviewing courts should not flyspeck trial proceedings with the benefit of 20/20 appellate hindsight. \u201c[T]he Constitution entitles a criminal defendant to a fair trial, not a perfect one.\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Instead, our law generally demands that trial results not be overturned unless a miscarriage of justice has occurred.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> This was a 7-day jury trial featuring more than 20 witnesses and numerous exhibits. It is often difficult for seasoned practitioners and judges to keep pace with trial proceedings. It is substantially more difficult for the jury to do so. This one fleeting, arguably inaccurate statement to which no objection was made does not detract from the actual evidence presented at trial and the prosecutor\u2019s truthful statement that Yancy \u201cdid not get consideration on this case for testifying.\u201d Moreover, the prosecutor\u2019s statement was responsive to defense counsel\u2019s line of questioning that suggested that Yancy had been compensated for his testimony against defendant. And not only did defense counsel suggest that Yancy had been compensated for his testimony against defendant, but he later stated in closing argument, without any factual basis, that Yancy \u201clied to you about his plea, whether he pled.\u201d Notwithstanding this assertion by defense counsel, there is absolutely no evidence that Yancy received any deal from the prosecution in exchange for his testimony in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">Further, the majority exaggerates the prejudicial effect of the alleged error. The extent to which Yancy\u2019s credibility was bolstered by argument that he had only been paid by the FBI for his cooperation in other cases is, at best, marginal. Additionally, the alleged error was clearly precipitated by the prosecutor\u2019s willing<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>ness to accommodate defense counsel\u2019s trial strategy that avoided \u201copening the door to Pierson Hood\u201d because, as the trial court noted, doing so would be hazardous.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Both the prosecutor and defense counsel fastidiously avoided mention of the Pierson Hood gang during trial. Rather than delve into specific prejudicial information that Yancy had provided to the FBI, defense counsel sought to challenge Yancy on his claim that he was not paid \u201cwith regards to this case\u201d and impeached Yancy by suggesting not only that Yancy had received cash from the FBI for cooperation, but that he had also received some tacit benefit from the prosecution for his testimony and cooperation.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">Finally, the majority does not address whether even if Yaxley's testimony had been struck from the record, the prosecution nonetheless presented sufficient independent evidence at trial to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant murdered Pass. Even if evidence is improperly admitted to bolster a witness\u2019s character for truthfulness, reversal is not required under MCL 769.26 if there exists other cumulative and independent evidence to support the conviction.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> The majority apparently assumes that the jury simply did not believe the other key witness for the prosecution, but \u201c[t]he jury is the sole judge of the facts; its role includes listening to testimony, weighing evidence, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>making credibility determinations.\u201d<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Contrary to the assertions of the majority, Lard\u2019s testimony was largely consistent with Yancy\u2019s testimony with regard to the murder of Pass. It would be very difficult to conclude that the jury convicted defendant on the basis of Yancy\u2019s testimony while rejecting Lard\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-4\">Specifically, Yancy and Lard consistently testified that Lard brought defendant to Pass\u2019s home, that they used a mutual acquaintance\u2019s name to validate their intent to purchase cocaine, and that Pass let them inside. Inside the house, defendant and Pass discussed purchasing cocaine in the kitchen, and both Yancy and Lard saw Pass enter the bathroom, presumably to retrieve cocaine. After Pass returned to the kitchen, both Yancy and Lard heard multiple gunshots coming from the kitchen area, where only defendant and Pass were present. Lard testified that neither he nor Yancy shot Pass, but that defendant did so. Lard\u2019s testimony alone provided a rational basis to establish that defendant shot and killed Pass. In sum, having examined the entire cause, I cannot conclude that the error alleged by defendant affirmatively appears to have resulted in a miscarriage of justice. I would affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b725-6\"> I hope my fear is unfounded, as suggested by the majority in footnote 9 of its opinion. There, the majority suggests that it is the prosecutor\u2019s exploitation of a \u201cfalse impression\u201d during closing argument that justifies reversal. While I take issue with the majority\u2019s characterization of the prosecutor\u2019s conduct, if this is the majority\u2019s position, it should have said that and no more.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">But even if the rule announced by the majority today is intended as a narrow one, as emphatically stated by the majority, the opinion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>remains rife with directives that a prosecutor must do more than refrain from knowingly arguing to the jury facts known to be untrue. Instead, the majority imposes on the prosecution the burden to do more than ensure that testimony elicited on direct examination is truthful; that testimony must now be truthful and complete. And it also imposes on the prosecution an obligation to correct misguided testimony that a reviewing court might later declare to be \u201csubstantially misleading,\u201d even when that testimony is the product of defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination and when, as here, defense counsel is fully aware that the testimony is misleading, has all the information needed to effectively cross-examine the witness on this point, and, as a matter of trial strategy, elects to let that testimony stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">So if, as the majority states, my fear of the breadth of the majority opinion is overblown, it nevertheless seems to be fully justified and anchored in the various broad statements scattered throughout its opinion that are not congruent with the majority\u2019s claim that it announces a narrow rule.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b726-7\"> <em>Giglio v United States, </em>405 US 150, 153; 92 S Ct 763; 31 L Ed 2d 104 (1972) (citation omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b726-8\"> <em>Ante </em>at 475-476, citing <em>Napue v Illinois, </em>360 US 264, 271-272; 79 S Ct 1173; 3 L Ed 2d 1217 (1959).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b726-9\"> <em>People v Wiese, </em>425 Mich 448, 455; 389 NW2d 866 (1986), quoting <em>Napue, </em>360 US at 269.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b728-7\"> Specifically, defense counsel made a discovery request seeking</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-8\">[c]opies of any and all written and/or electronically recorded agreements for the payment of funds by the FBI and any other police agency to any cooperating witness in this cause, including, but not limited to, Mark Yancy and Tarence Lard [a codefendant in this case], and logs and other records pertaining to such payments. A summary of the content of any oral agreements is also requested.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b728-9\">As a result of this discovery request, the trial court conducted the evidentiary hearing at which FBI Special Agent Dan Harris testified.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b728-10\"> Defendant was on trial for the murder of Larry Pass. The majority minimizes the fact that the compensation paid to Yancy was not exclusively for information related to the Pass homicide. In fact, the main focus of the FBI investigation was the Pierson Hood gang and, as Harris testified, Yanc/s compensation was due in significant part for his cooperation relating to the gang activity. Importantly, the record reveals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>that defense counsel wanted to avoid at all costs any reference to the Pierson Hood gang to ensure that the jury never learned of defendant\u2019s ties to gang activity. See footnote 17 of this opinion. Therefore, it is entirely possible that the prosecutor did not develop the full extent of Yancy\u2019s compensation agreement with the FBI in order to accommodate defense counsel\u2019s strategy of distancing defendant from the highly publicized Pierson Hood gang.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b729-10\"> The majority accuses me of conflating the prosecution\u2019s obligation to disclose exculpatory information under <em>Brady v Maryland, </em>373 US 83, 87; 83 S Ct 1194; 10 L Ed 2d 215 (1963), with the duty to correct false testimony under <em>Napue, </em>360 US at 269. The United Stated Supreme Court has stated, however, that \u201c[t]he rule <em>o\u00ed Brady ... </em>arguably applies in three quite different situations\u201d and that \u201c[e]ach involves the discovery, after trial of information which had been known to the prosecution but unknown to the defense.\u201d <em>United States v Agurs, </em>427 US 97, 103; 96 S Ct 2392; 49 L Ed 2d 342 (1976). The Supreme Court observed that one of these situations arises when \u201cundisclosed evidence demonstrates that the prosecution\u2019s case includes perjured testimony and that the prosecution knew, or should have known, of the perjury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court, citing <em>Napue </em>and <em>Giglio, </em>then stated that \u201ca conviction obtained by the knowing use of perjured testimony is fundamentally unfair.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The majority here has created a new rule that wholly separates the duties under <em>Napue </em>from those under <em>Brady </em>even though the duties are inextricably linked. The United States Supreme Court has recognized this, stating that each <em>Brady </em>situation, including those having claims under <em>Napue </em>and <em>Giglio, </em>involves information known by the prosecution but unknown to defense counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-11\">While there may be circumstances in which the prosecution has complied with <em>Brady </em>yet failed to meet an overriding duty to correct a witness\u2019s perjured testimony, we ought not let appellate hindsight decouple <em>Brady </em>from <em>Napue </em>in cases in which it is clear that defense counsel was aware that the testimony was arguably misleading and yet declined to clarify it for the jury</p>\n<p id=\"b729-12\">The majority attempted to decouple <em>Brady </em>from <em>Napue </em>by citing three federal cases: <em>DeMarco v United States, </em>928 F2d 1074,1076-1077 (CA11, 1991), <em>United States v Sanfilippo, </em>564 F2d 176,178-179 (CA5,1977), and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number><em>Jenkins vArtuz, </em>294 F3d 284,296 (CA2,2002). The majority's reliance on these cases is seriously misplaced. Tb begin with, <em>DeMarco </em>involved actual perjured testimony, while the instant case involves, at best, \u201csubstantially misleading testimony.\u201d Further, a more recent case from the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, <em>Routly v Singletary, </em>33 F3d 1279, 1286 (CA 11, 1994), concluded that when \u201ctestimony concerning [a witness\u2019s] understanding was, at worst, equivocal, [it was] not so misleading as to require corrective action by the state.\u201d Further, while <em>Routly </em>expressly acknowledged <em>DeMarco, </em>it nonetheless held that \u201c[t]here is no violation of due process resulting from prosecuto-rial non-disclosure of false testimony if defense counsel is aware of it and fails to object.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">Similarly <em>Sanfilippo, </em>was quickly distinguished within its own circuit. See <em>United States v Antone, </em>603 F2d 566, 571 (CA 5, 1979). Interestingly, in <em>Beltran v Cockrell, </em>294 F3d 730, 736-737 (CA 5, 2002), the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit explained that \u201c[t]he <em>Sanfilippo </em>court did not deal with the situation presented here, where the prosecution used the false testimony <em>consciously allowed by the defense as part of a legal strategy.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Likewise, defense counsel in this case chose as part of his trial strategy to ignore Yancy\u2019s testimony and instead represent to the jury that Yancy and the prosecution had a tacit agreement that Yancy would not be charged for any crime in exchange for his testimony against defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-7\">Finally, the majority\u2019s reliance on <em>Jenkins </em>is misplaced because that court expressly stated that defense counsel, unlike defense counsel in this case, had not relied on the witness\u2019s problematic testimony to advance a strategic or tactical omission at trial. In sum, the cases the majority cites are easily distinguishable. Moreover, the majority uses these cases for a proposition that has been rejected by more recent cases in those same circuits. In fact, a majority of federal courts have rejected the rule the majority now invokes.

See footnote 17 of this opinion. This explains why the testimony is scant with regard to Yancy\u2019s compensation. It appears from the record that Yancy\u2019s cooperation in the investigation of the Pass homicide was limited to an interview in 2006 with Flint police officer Shawn Ellis. Thereafter, the FBI continued its investigation into the gang-related activity. We are not informed of the extent of Yancy\u2019s cooperation with regard to the Pierson Hood investigation, but we know that the FBI did not compensate witnesses until the <em>FBI </em>no longer needed the witness\u2019s cooperation. Yancy was compensated in the fall of 2008. This case did not go to trial until the spring of 2011.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b735-23\"> Defense counsel did not highlight why the FBI paid Yancy. As later revealed during a discussion outside the presence of the jury, he had good reason to stay away from this topic:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A3_\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number><em>The Court: </em>The jury is yet to be called for. Are we ready for our jurors?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-5\"><em>[Defense Counsel]: No. </em>There was just one issue that I wanted to get your opinion on one way or the other before I start my cross-examination and that is this. Listening to the detective, and it\u2019s no secret there was an interview of Yancy in \u201906, in the summer of \u201906 if I understood his testimony. My client wasn\u2019t arrested until December of \u201907. If I ask the officer to confirm, I won\u2019t be asking the officer why, but if I ask the officer to confirm when my client was arrested, am I opening the door to Pierson Hood?

So, I need to know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-7\">[Prosecutor]: Your Honor, the reason that there was a delay was because of the Pierson Hood investigation.

It would certainly suggest \u2014 if it is the delay in an arrest the defendant is seeking to elicit from the officer, then an explanation for the delay in arrest would be certainly forthcoming.

Rather, defense counsel sought to impeach Yancjfs claim that he was not paid \u201cwith regards to this case\u201d by suggesting that Yancy had received some tacit benefit from the prosecution for his testimony and cooperation.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-12\">Further, it appears that an integral part of defense counsel\u2019s trial strategy was to avoid mentioning Yancas cooperation in the Pierson Hood gang investigation. This is a significant fact that the majority ignores. And it is significant precisely because the majority holds the prosecutor responsible for failing to \u201ccorrect\u201d evidence that was not patently false and that the defense introduced for its own purpose.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b737-6\"> While the majority does not share the view that a <em>Napue </em>error can be waived because counsel could have addressed the issue on cross-examination, I note that the majority of the federal courts of appeals have expressed views consistent with this approach: <em>United States v Iverson, </em>208 US App DC 364, 366; 648 F2d 737 (1981) (\u201c[W]e hold that, absent unusual circumstances, the right of the defendant to disclosure by the prosecutor is deemed waived if defense counsel with actual knowledge of the plea agreement or sentencing status information chooses not to present such information to the jury.\u201d); <em>Green v United States, </em>266 F2d 483, 484 (CA 1, 1958) (\u201cBut [the defendant] cannot have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>it both ways.

Like defense counsel, the court was not surprised by and did not in any way express concern about or take exception to the testimony from Yancy that the majority today declares to be \u201csubstantially misleading, if not false.\u201d That neither defense counsel nor the experienced and knowledgeable trial judge (both officers of the court under an ethical obligation to correct false testimony) took exception to this testimony weighs strongly in support of my conclusion that the testimony and evidence in question are not material in the greater scheme of this criminal trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b739-8\"> <em>People v Carter, </em>462 Mich 206, 215; 612 NW2d 144 (2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b740-4\"> <em>Id. </em>at 218, citing <em>New York v Hill, </em>528 US 110, 114; 120 S Ct 659; 145 L Ed 2d 560 (2000). <em>Hill </em>further explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-5\">[a]s to many decisions pertaining to the conduct of the trial, the defendant is \u201cdeemed bound by the acts of his lawyer-agent and is considered to have \u2018notice of all facts, notice of which can be charged upon the attorney.\u2019 \u201d Thus, decisions by counsel are generally given effect as to what arguments to pursue, what evidentiary objections to raise, and what agreements to conclude regarding the admission of evidence.

After the witness was excused but before the trial concluded, the prosecutor informed the defendant and the court of the witness\u2019s remuneration from the prosecution. Accordingly, it was evident that the witness presented false testimony. The defendant did nothing with this information and on appeal claimed that the prosecution had breached the duty to correct false testimony. The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit concluded that the defendant had waived the issue by failing to take any action after being informed of the evidence affecting the witness\u2019s credibility. <em>Id. </em>at 1170. The majority here asserts that because the prosecutor in <em>Harris </em>disclosed to the defendant the full extent and nature of its remuneration with the witness, the prosecution ultimately complied with its <em>Napue </em>obligation. The <em>Harris </em>disclosure came in the midst of the trial and after the critical witness was excused. I respectfully submit that if disclosure of evidence affecting a witness\u2019s credibility is timely when provided in the midst of trial yet after the critical witness has been excused, there should be no question but that the prosecution satisfied its <em>Napue </em>obligation here when it disclosed to defense counsel and the trial court the full and complete extent of Yancy\u2019s compensation from the FBI at the 2010 hearing during which Special Agent Harris testified.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b741-5\"> Again, in each United States Supreme Court case the majority relies on, defense counsel and the trial court were entirely unaware of any of the details relating to the state\u2019s agreements to compensate witnesses for their testimony. Thus, defense counsel in those cases obviously could not have objected. In this case, however, defense counsel was aware and readily could have objected to Yancy\u2019s testimony. Defense counsel\u2019s knowledge invokes an important principle of appellate review. That is, \u201c[t]his Court disfavors consideration of unpreserved claims of error.\u201d <em>People v Carines, </em>460 Mich 750, 761; 597 NW2d 130 (1999). \u201cMichigan has long recognized the importance of preserving issues for appellate review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 762. Moreover, we recognize that \u201c[tjrial is \u2018by far the best time to address a defendant\u2019s constitutional and nonconsti-tutional rights.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>People v Grant, </em>445 Mich 535, 551; 520 NW2d 123 (1994) (emphasis omitted). For these reasons I seriously question the propriety of the majority\u2019s chosen standard of review, which only requires a defendant to establish a \u201c \u2018reasonable likelihood\u2019 that the [allegedly false or substantially misleading testimony] affected the judgment of the jury,\u201d quoting <em>Napue, </em>360 US at 271. In my view, this standard only applies when the issue could not have been preserved at trial. See, e.g., <em>Robinson v Arvonio, </em>27 F3d 877, 886 (CA 3, 1994) (\u201c[Wjhen it became clear that the prosecutor had not corrected the perjured testimony, the defense attorney could have alerted the judge and sought a remedy that would have eliminated any possibility of prejudice to his client.... Instead, the defense attorney sought to counter the misleading impression through cross-examination and closing argument. Although we agree with [the defendant] that his attorney did not waive the error by failing to call it to the attention of the court, <em>an error which the defense attorney could have corrected at trial is not likely \u2018to infect the integrity of the proceeding </em>....\u2019 \u201d), vacated 513 US 1186 (1995) (citation omitted) (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b741-6\"> <em>Carines, </em>460 Mich at 763; see also <em>People v Vaughn, </em>491 Mich 642, 663-664; 821 NW2d 288 (2012).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b742-6\"><em> Carines, </em>460 Mich at 763, citing <em>United States v Olano, </em>507 US 725, 731-734; 113 S Ct 1770; 123 L Ed 2d 508 (1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b742-7\"> <em>Cannes, </em>460 Mich at 763, citing <em>Olano, </em>507 US at 734.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b742-8\"> <em>Cannes, </em>460 Mich at 763. Further, \u201c[t]he reviewing court should reverse only when the defendant is actually innocent or the error seriously affected the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 774. The majority claims that when \u201cthe prosecutor deliberately exploit[s] misleading evidence before the jury, [it] clearly affects \u2018the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u2019 \u201d While I take issue with the majority\u2019s characterization of the prosecutor\u2019s conduct, I also note that the rule of law sanctioned by the majority in this case will give similarly situated defendants a free bite at the apple in future cases. Specifically, defense counsel aware of false testimony can ignore that testimony and roll the dice with a jury, knowing full well that if an acquittal is not obtained, the testimony will afford defendant a reversal on appeal. This rule of law seriously affects \u201cthe fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b742-9\"> <em>People v Smith, </em>unpublished opinion per curiam opinion of the Court of Appeals, issued October 29, 2013 (Docket No. 304935), p 5.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b743-8\"> <em>Carines, </em>460 Mich at 763, quoting <em>Olano, </em>507 US at 734.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b744-8\"> <em>People v Lukity, </em>460 Mich 484, 491; 596 NW2d 607 (1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b744-9\"> <em>Id. </em>at 492, quoting <em>People v Mateo, </em>453 Mich 203, 215; 551 NW2d 891 (1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b745-6\"> See <em>Delaware v Van Arsdall, </em>475 US 673, 681; 106 S Ct 1431; 89 L Ed 2d 674 (1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b745-7\"> See, e.g., MCL 769.26.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"34\">\n<p id=\"b746-6\"> In 2007, the Flint Safe Streets Task Force, which included members of local and federal law enforcement, arrested more than 30 people related to the Pierson Hood gang, which was a criminal enterprise.
