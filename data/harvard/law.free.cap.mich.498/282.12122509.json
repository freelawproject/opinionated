Civ Serv R 6-7.2. Although we conclude that public collective bargaining is a method by which the Civil Service Commission (the commission) may choose to exercise its constitutional duties, we hold that the commission may not effectively require civil servants to fund the commission\u2019s own administrative operations. Accordingly, we affirm, albeit on different grounds, the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-10\">FACTS AND HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b514-11\">The legislation commonly known as the \u201cRight to Work\u201d laws\u2014Public Acts 348 and 349 of 2012\u2014were made effective March 27, 2013. 2012 PA 348 governs private employers and 2012 PA 349 governs public employers. This case concerns the constitutionality of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>2012 PA 349. Section 3 of 2012 PA 349 amends the public employment relations act (PERA), MCL 423.201 <em>et seq., </em>to provide that public employers may not require their employees to join a union or pay union dues, fees, or other expenses \u201cas a condition of obtaining or continuing public employment. . . .\u201d MCL 423.210(3) (\u201c[A]n individual shall not be required as a condition of obtaining or continuing public employment to do any of the following: . . . (c) [p]ay any dues, fees, assessments, or other charges or expenses of any kind or amount, or provide anything of value to a labor organization or bargaining representative.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">The commission\u2019s current rules, however, affirmatively and expressly allow public collective bargaining agreements that provide for the collection of an agency shop fee from union-eligible employees who opt out of union membership. Civ Serv R 6-7.2 (last amended April 29, 2004) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-6\">Nothing in this rule precludes the employer from making an agreement with an exclusive representative to require, as a condition of continued employment, that each eligible employee in the unit who chooses not to become a member of the exclusive representative shall pay a service fee to the exclusive representative. If agreed to in a collective bargaining agreement, the state may deduct the service fee by payroll deduction. An appointing authority shall not deduct a service fee unless the employee has filed a prior written authorization or as otherwise authorized in a collective bargaining agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">Plaintiffs, union representatives of classified civil service employees, contend that agency shop fees defray various union activity costs. In accordance with the current rules, plaintiff unions have negotiated various agreements with the state that contain agency shop fee arrangements covering the employees whom they represent.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>2012 PA 349 purports to make these mandatory agency shop fees illegal. Plaintiff labor unions filed the instant complaint in February 2013 challenging the validity of 2012 PA 349, \u00a7 3.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Plaintiffs alleged that, under Const 1963, art 11, \u00a7 5, the statute\u2019s agency shop fee prohibition cannot apply to the commission because it infringes the commission\u2019s constitutional mandate to \u201cregulate all conditions of employment\u201d for civil servants.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">The Court of Appeals in a split decision held that the Legislature possesses the authority to enact legislation concerning and restricting agency shop fees. <em>Int\u2019l Union v Green, </em>302 Mich App 246; 839 NW2d 1 (2013). In reaching that conclusion, the Court of Appeals reasoned that the commission\u2019s power to \u201cregulate\u201d conditions of employment is necessarily subservient to the Legislature\u2019s power to \u201cenact laws\u201d relative to hours and conditions of employment. The dissent, on the other hand, would have held that agency shop fees are \u201cconditions of employment\u201d by virtue of being \u201con-duty employment concerns.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 294 (GLEICHER, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">Questions of constitutional and statutory interpretation are reviewed de novo. <em>Hunter v Hunter, </em>484 Mich 247, 257; 771 NW2d 694 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b516-9\">Our primary goal in construing a constitutional provision is to give effect to the intent of the people of the state of Michigan who ratified the Constitution, by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>applying the rule of \"common understanding.\u201d See <em>Goldstone v Bloomfield Twp Pub Library, </em>479 Mich 554, 558-559; 737 NW2d 476 (2007) (\u201cWhen interpreting constitutional provisions, our primary objective is to realize the intent of the people by whom and for whom the constitution was ratified. That is, we seek the \u2018common understanding\u2019 of the people at the time the constitution was ratified. This involves applying the plain meaning of each term used at the time of ratification, unless technical, legal terms are used.\u201d) (citations and quotation marks omitted). We identify the common understanding of constitutional text by applying the plain meaning of the text at the time of ratification. <em>Wayne Co v Hathcock, </em>471 Mich 445, 468-469; 684 NW2d 765 (2004). Interpretation of a constitutional provision also takes account of \u201cthe circumstances leading to the adoption of the provision and the purpose sought to be accomplished.\u201d <em>People v Tanner, </em>496 Mich 199, 226; 853 NW2d 653 (2014) (citation and quotation marks omitted). Unless we are able to determine that a constitutional provision had some other particularized or specialized meaning in the collective mind of the 1963 electorate, we must give effect to the natural meaning of the language used in the Constitution. <em>Mich United Conservation Clubs v Secretary of State (After Remand), </em>464 Mich 359, 376; 630 NW2d 297 (2001) (YOUNG, J., concurring). Technical legal terms are those that have acquired a special meaning and \u201cmust be interpreted in light of the meaning that those sophisticated in the law would have given those terms at the time of ratification.\u201d <em>Dep\u2019t of Transp v Tomkins, </em>481 Mich 184, 191; 749 NW2d 716 (2008). The Address to the People, which was distributed to Michigan citizens in advance of the ratification vote and which explained in everyday language what each provision of the proposed new Con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>stitution was intended to accomplish, <em>Walker v Wolverine Fabricating &amp; Mfg Co, Inc, </em>425 Mich 586, 597; 391 NW2d 296 (1986), and, to a lesser degree, the constitutional convention debates themselves are also relevant in determining the ratifiers\u2019 intent. <em>Lapeer Co Clerk v Lapeer Circuit Court, </em>469 Mich 146, 156; 665 NW2d 452 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">\u201cThe Civil Service Commission is a constitutional body . . . .\u201d <em>Viculin v Dep\u2019t of Civil Serv, </em>386 Mich 375, 393; 192 NW2d 449 (1971). It possesses \u201cplenary and absolute powers in its field.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 398. The constitutional provision concerning the commission, Article 11, \u00a7 5, provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-6\">The Commission shall classify all positions in the classified service according to their respective duties and responsibilities, fix rates of compensation for all classes of positions, approve or disapprove disbursements for all personal services, determine by competitive examination and performance exclusively on the basis of merit, efficiency and fitness the qualifications of all candidates for positions in the classified service, make rules and regulations covering all personnel transactions, and regulate all conditions of employment in the classified service. [Const 1963, art 11, \u00a7 5, \u00b6 4.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">Article 11, \u00a7 5 thus sets forth the \u201cduties of the Civil Service Commission [.]\u201d See <em>Mich Coalition of State Employee Unions v Civil Serv Comm, </em>465 Mich 212, 221; 634 NW2d 692 (2001). The commission possesses authority over and exercises its duties concerning, in part, \u201cthe procedures by which a state civil service employee may review his grievance,\u201d <em>Viculin, </em>386 Mich at 393, as well as rates of compensation and conditions of employment. See <em>Council No 11, AFSCME v Civil Serv Comm, </em>408 Mich 385, 406; 292 NW2d 442 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">The commission\u2019s rules authorize the use of public collective bargaining agreements as a mechanism for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>exercising its constitutional authority over such matters as grievance procedures and rates of compensation. See, e.g., Civ Serv R 6-9.6(a) (\u201cAn exclusive representative and the employer may agree upon a procedure for the resolution of grievances of exclusively represented employees against the departmental employer..Civ Serv R 6-3.6(b) (\u201cThe rates of compensation for all existing grades within a classification of positions . . . may be established in a collective bargaining agreement. . .\u201d). The commission retains absolute authority over the contents of a public collective bargaining agreement. Civ Serv R 6-3.1(b) (\u201cThe civil service commission retains the authority to (1) approve, modify, or reject, in whole or in part, a proposed collective bargaining agreement presented to it for review and (2) to impose on the parties and eligible employees a collective bargaining agreement as modified by the commission.\u201d). This authority makes clear that the commission uses public collective bargaining as one important tool within its constitutional arsenal, establishing a procedure by which civil servants and the state employer may bargain over a variety of employment-related matters. This choice presumably reflects the commission\u2019s judgment that it wishes to facilitate input from the employees\u2019 representatives. If the commission deems public collective bargaining to be an appropriate mechanism for exercising its constitutional duties, that is its prerogative and we have no warrant to challenge this aspect of its exercise of authority. See <em>Makowski v Governor, </em>495 Mich 465, 471; 852 NW2d 61 (2014), citing <em>Marbury v Madison, </em>5 US (1 Crunch) 137, 170; 2 L Ed 60 (1803) (applying <em>Marbury </em>to Michigan\u2019s three branches of government and stating that \u201ccourts may not inquire into how the executive or his officers perform their duties in which they have discretion\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>Having established for the purposes of this case that the commission may authorize public collective bargaining as a tool in the exercise of its constitutional duties, we turn to the specific issue before us: whether the mandatory agency shop fee is consistent with such authorization. Although authorizing public collective bargaining agreements is within the commission\u2019s sound judgment, we hold that the commission <em>lacks </em>the authority to tax or appropriate\u2014to wit, the authority to compel civil service employees to make involuntary financial contributions to subsidize the commission\u2019s exercise of its constitutional duties and responsibilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">Generally, of course, the power to tax and appropriate rests exclusively with the Legislature. See <em>46th Circuit Trial Court v Crawford Co, </em>476 Mich 131, 141; 719 NW2d 553 (2006) (opinion by MARKMAN, J.); see also Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 1 (\u201cThe legislature shall impose taxes sufficient with other resources to pay the expenses of state government.\u201d). It has been stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-5\">The power to tax defines the extent to which economic resources will be apportioned between the people and their government, while the power to appropriate defines the priorities of government. Partly in recognition of the enormity of these powers, the framers of our constitutions determined that the branch of government to exercise these powers should be that branch which is closest to, and most representative of, the people [i.e., the Legislature]. <em>[46th Circuit Trial Court, </em>476 Mich at 141-142 (opinion by Markman, J.).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">Indeed, we have recognized that this is \u201cthe most fundamental aspect of the \u2018legislative power ....\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 141 (opinion by MARKMAN, J.). Therefore, in order for another constitutional body, such as the commission, to exercise the same powers that are historically vested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>in our Legislature, the Constitution must affirmatively provide for them. See <em>Soap &amp; Detergent Ass\u2019n v Natural Resources Comm, </em>415 Mich 728, 752-753; 330 NW2d 346 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">In an unrelated, but illustrative, context, the commission actually enjoys such a narrow and highly distinctive power of appropriation. Paragraph 7 of Const 1963, art 11, \u00a7 5, expressly empowers the commission to increase civil servants\u2019 rates of compensation by having that increase placed into the state\u2019s annual budget. That increase becomes effective unless the Legislature vetoes the commission\u2019s increase by a supermajority vote. In turn, when the commission opts to increase the payroll of employees in the civil service, the Constitution automatically increases the commission\u2019s own administrative operational budget in direct proportion to the payroll increase. Const 1963, art 11, \u00a7 5, \u00b6\u00b6 7 and 10. Specifically, \u00b6 10 of Const 1963, art 11, \u00a7 5 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-6\">To enable the commission to exercise its powers, the legislature shall appropriate to the commission for the ensuing fiscal year a sum not less than one per cent of the aggregate payroll of the classified service for the preceding fiscal year, as certified by the commission. Within six months after the conclusion of each fiscal year the commission shall return to the state treasury all moneys unexpended for that fiscal year.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">At the constitutional convention, this\u2014the commission\u2019s \u201cprivilege of a mandatory [administrative operational] appropriation\u201d\u2014was rightfully described as \u201cextraordinary.\u201d 1 Official Record, Constitutional Convention 1961, p 639 (stating that \u201c[t]he commission does not appear to have abused its extraordinary privilege of a mandatory appropriation\u201d in order to raise the payroll and, by extension, its own budget).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>But the commission\u2019s limited and explicit power to appropriate its own administrative funding by adjusting budgeted rates of compensation stands in stark contrast to an asserted broad and implicit power to appropriate funds from whatever source. The former has textual support in the Constitution, while the latter does not. There is simply no authority in the Constitution that would support an argument that its ratifiers commonly and reasonably understood the commission as possessing the authority that plaintiffs ascribe to it\u2014in particular, the power to require that assessments from civil servants\u2019 paychecks additionally subsidize the commission\u2019s own duties and responsibilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">Reading this administrative funding provision in Article 11, \u00a7 5, \u00b6 10 in context with the enumeration of the commission\u2019s powers in \u00b6 4 underscores that the ratifiers could not have contemplated that civil servants would serve as an alternative or additional source of funding for the commission\u2019s budget. The <em>only </em>potential source of an authority to permit mandatory agency shop fees is the commission\u2019s power to \u201cregulate\u201d the conditions of employment, which regulation is effected through public collective bargaining agreements. But the power to \u201cregulate\u201d does not encompass the specific authority to compel other entities, including civil servants themselves, to subsidize the commission\u2019s constitutional operations. This authority is one of taxation and appropriation and is fundamentally legislative in character.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">Indeed, the presence of the funding provision of Article 11, \u00a7 5, \u00b6 10 serves to confirm this analysis, which concludes that the ratifiers must have understood, consistent with separation of powers principles, that the commission would be adequately funded by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>the Legislature in proportion to the size of the civil service. In that paragraph, the Constitution provides the commission with the financial means \u201c[t]o enable the commission to exercise its powers [.]\u201d In other words, upon receiving an operating appropriation, which is scaled to one percent of the total payroll of all classified civil servants, the Constitution considers the commission \u201cenable [d]\u201d to exercise all of its powers\u2014 including its power to \u201cregulate all conditions of employment in the classified service.\u201d In light of the foregoing, the commission cannot simply provide itself with additional administrative operating funds as a function of its authority to \u201cregulate.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Instead, because the Constitution provides the commission with a source of funding \u201cto enable [it] to exercise its powers,\u201d the ratifiers must have reasonably understood that to be the commission\u2019s <em>exclusive </em>source of funding. See <em>Blank v Dep\u2019t of Corrections, </em>462 Mich 103, 142 n 14; 611 NW2d 530 (2000) (MARKMAN, J., concurring) (\u201cThere is nothing unusual about the principle that language couched in terms of an affirmative grant can also reasonably imply a restriction.\u201d); see also Cooley, Constitutional Limitations (1868), p 64 (\u201c[W]here the means for the exercise of a granted power are given, no other or different means can be implied, as being more effective or convenient.\u201d) (citation and quotation marks omitted). It follows then that the commission lacks the power to compel funding for its administrative operational duties from another and unstated source. Ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>cordingly, we hold that allowing the imposition of mandatory agency shop fees upon civil servants is beyond the commission\u2019s constitutional authority.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Civ Serv R 6-7.2 is unconstitutional to the extent it allows the exaction of such fees.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">RESPONSE TO THE DISSENT</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">The dissent does not disagree with our conclusion that the commission lacks the authority to demand additional administrative operating funds from third parties. Rather, it is the dissent\u2019s position that, because employees are forced to pay the agency shop fees <em>directly to the unions, </em>rather than to the commission itself, the fees \u201cdo not fund the commission\u2019s \u2018administrative operational duties\u2019 to establish the conditions of employment\u201d as we have reasoned.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We respectfully argue that the dissent misses the point of our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>The fact that, here, the agency fees are paid to the union does not change the fact that the commission permits collective bargaining in order to fulfill <em>its </em>constitutional obligation to regulate conditions of employment. Thus, using collective bargaining for that purpose provides a benefit that flows directly to the commission.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Contrary to the dissent\u2019s assertion that \u201cthere has been no finding\u2014not even an allegation\u2014 that agency fees fund [the commission\u2019s] regulatory efforts,\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the commission\u2019s own rules link collective bargaining <em>directly </em>to conditions of employment. Under Civ Serv R 6-2.1(d), \u201c[t]he provisions of a collective bargaining agreement, when approved by the commission, <em>become a subset of the civil service rules governing </em>. . . <em>conditions of employment </em>for the eligible employees in the applicable unit.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This is underscored by the commission\u2019s absolute control over collective bargaining agreements, which renders them merely advisory until approved by the commission and illustrates that the <em>commission </em>is the true beneficiary of the collective bargaining process it has authorized in order to fulfill its constitutional regulatory obligation. Although the employers and employees may benefit from collective bargaining, those entities enjoy any such positive externalities at the grace of the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">As explained earlier, collective bargaining is one method by which the commission has chosen to exercise its obligation to \u201cregulate all conditions of employment.\u201d And this is the critical point in our analysis that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>explains why the commission is the true beneficiary of the collective bargaining process: Unless collective bargaining was a proper method of regulating conditions of employment within the civil service, there would be no lawful basis for the commission to permit it at all. Stated differently, because the commission can permit collective bargaining, it follows that it does so as part of its own duty to regulate. The agency fees in turn exist to support that regulatory duty, regardless of who receives them.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">Having chosen this method of regulating conditions of employment, what the commission cannot do is foist the administrative costs of that choice onto anyone else. This principle remains true regardless of who pays whom. What matters is who authorizes and receives the benefit. Illustratively, had the commission chosen another method by which to regulate conditions of employment\u2014for example, by hiring a panel of consultant labor economists\u2014no one would assert that the labor economists could then submit their invoice to the affected civil servants. That is precisely what the commission has done in passing on to civil servants the cost of regulating conditions of employment through the mechanism of collective bargaining.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">The dissent further assigns significance to the fact that the commission authorizes, rather than requires, an employer to force its employees to pay agency shop fees. This does not affect our reasoning. The dissent cites no authority for the proposition that the commission can authorize an employer to do something that the commission itself cannot do.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Given the fact that collective bargaining can only exist as a means to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>permit the commission to discharge its constitutional obligation, it is irrelevant that an employer retains the choice whether to require agency shop fees. When no agency shop fee is assessed, there is no constitutional problem. But whenever an employer opts to require the agency shop fee, the fee comes into existence as a mechanism to fund collective bargaining and, by extension, the commission\u2019s regulatory obligations. Permitting agency shop fees is therefore impermissible for the reasons stated earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">It therefore remains unnecessary for us to respond to the dissent\u2019s argument that 2012 PA 349 is prohibited by Const 1963, art 4, \u00a7 48.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">The authority of the Civil Service Commission is not without limits. Although public collective bargaining is a method by which the commission may choose to exercise its constitutional duties, it may not require collection of agency shop fees to fund its administrative operations in pursuit of those duties. The commission\u2019s rules must yield to the Constitution when there is no authority for it to impose such fees. Accordingly, we affirm, albeit on different grounds, the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<judges id=\"b527-8\">MARKMAN, ZAHRA, and VIVIANO, JJ., concurred with YOUNG, C.J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b516-10\"> Under \u00a7 10(6) of 2012 PA 349, the Court of Appeals exercises exclusive original jurisdiction over such actions.

THE CIVIL SERVICE COMMISSION\u2019S CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">Article 11, \u00a7 5 of the Michigan Constitution establishes the Civil Service Commission as an executive agency and enumerates the following powers unique to the commission:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-6\">The commission shall classify all positions in the classified service according to their respective duties and responsibilities, fix rates of compensation for all classes of positions, approve or disapprove disbursements for all personal services, determine by competitive examination and performance exclusively on the basis of merit, efficiency and fitness the qualifications of all candidates for positions in the classified service, make rules and regulations covering all personnel transactions, and regulate all conditions of employment in the classified service.1<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>1</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b529-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>This provision originated in substantially the same form by a vote of the people in 1940,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> four years after a report by then Governor Frank Fitzgerald\u2019s study commission condemned \u201cthe system of political appointments, promotions, demotions, rewards and punishments\u201d that existed in Michigan as part of the spoils system.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">In the 75 years since the people of Michigan created the commission, this Court has consistently held that \u201c[t]he power to make \u2018rules and regulations covering all personnel transactions, and regulate all conditions of employment in the classified service\u2019 is indeed a plenary grant of power.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This power includes the \u201cauthority to regulate employment-related activity involving internal matters such as job specifications, compensation, grievance procedures, discipline, collective bargaining and job performance, including the power to prohibit activity during working hours which is found to interfere with satisfactory job performance\u201d and \u201cto regulate and even prohibit off-duty activity which is found to interfere with job performance.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">Given that promulgating rules authorizing collective bargaining is within the scope of the commission\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>authority\u2014a claim that the majority does not contest\u2014 the Court of Appeals has long held that the commission determines whether employees in the classified civil service may engage in collective bargaining at all:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-4\">The constitution of 1963 does not expressly give public employees the right to collectively bargain. ... The commission controls all conditions of employment and is vested with plenary powers in its sphere of authority. . .. Only the Civil Service Commission has the power to provide for grievance procedures because it alone has the power to \u201cregulate <em>all </em>conditions of employment\u201d in the state classified civil service.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">In regulating the conditions of employment, the commission has determined as a matter of policy to allow collective bargaining when the employees transfer bargaining authority to their exclusive representative.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>\u201cEmployees may organize, form, assist, join, or refrain from joining labor organizations,\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and a majority of votes within a particular employee unit establishes \u201ca labor organization as the exclusive representative of all eligible employees in [the] unit. .. \u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The exclusive representative is the sole representative that may bargain with the employer.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">As part of its decision to establish collective bargaining, the commission enacted Rule 6-7.2, which allows an employer and an exclusive collective bargaining representative to agree\u2014either as part of a collective bargaining agreement or by separate agreement\u2014to \u201crequire, as a condition of continued employment, that each eligible employee in the unit who chooses not to become a member of the exclusive representative shall pay a service fee to the exclusive representative.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Accordingly, under agreements authorized by Rule 6.7-2, while an employee has the option to join or refrain from joining labor organizations,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> an employee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>does not have the option both to refrain from joining the labor organization that is his or her exclusive representative and to refuse to pay the service fee. Otherwise, the employee would receive the benefit of the exclusive representative\u2019s mandated services without paying for those services.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">As a result, the service fee (or \u201cagency fee\u201d) contemplated in Rule 6-7.2 is designed to pay the exclusive representative for its responsibilities to represent all employees\u2014both members and nonmembers\u2014not only during the collective bargaining process but also while the collective bargaining agreement is in effect. Agency fees cannot, however, encompass any activities outside of that process. To this end, Rule 6-7.3 specifies that the fee \u201ccannot exceed the employee\u2019s proportionate share of the costs of the activities that are necessary to perform its duties as the exclusive representative in dealing with the employer on labor-management issues\u201d and \u201cmay include only the costs germane to collective bargaining, contract administration, grievance adjustment, and any other cost necessarily or reasonably incurred for the purpose of performing the duties of an exclusive representative of the employees in dealing with the employer on labor-management issues.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> To ensure that agency fees encompass only the designated activities, Rule 6-7.4 details the right of an employee to object to the amount of a fee and the concurrent obligation of the exclusive representative to provide \u201cfinancial information sufficient to determine how the service fee is calculated.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b533-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>While the enactment of 2012 PA 349 illustrates that the policy rationales behind mandatory agency fees are debatable, what is clear to both sides of the policy debate is that agency fees are paid directly to an employee\u2019s exclusive representative, not to the commission, the employer, or any other public entity. By likening the commission\u2019s rule authorizing agency fees to the legislative \u201cpower to tax and appropriate\u201d and by claiming that the commission\u2019s agency fee rule attempts to exercise \u201cthe power to compel funding for its administrative operational duties from another. . . source,\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> the majority disregards this essential purpose of agency fees. Contrary to the majority\u2019s claim, agency fees do not amount to a tax or appropriation because, quite simply, they do not fund the commission\u2019s \u201cadministrative operational duties\u201d to establish the conditions of employment.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Rather, employees pay agency fees directly to their exclusive representative for the costs associated with representation during the collective bargaining process and while a collective bargaining agreement is operable. While the commission has separate operational and regulatory duties that include approving, rejecting, or amending the collective bargaining agreement that arises out of the collective bargaining process,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> there has been no finding\u2014not even an allegation\u2014that agency fees fund <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>these regulatory efforts.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">As stated, this Court has specifically held that the commission\u2019s authority includes the authority \u201cto regulate employment-related activity involving internal matters such as job specifications, compensation, grievance procedures, discipline, <em>collective bargaining </em>and job performance[.]\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The agency fee rule is a permissible exercise of the commission\u2019s regulatory authority because the rule regulates the mechanics of an employment-related activity\u2014the collective bargaining process.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">The majority\u2019s conclusion upsets this traditional understanding of the scope of the commission\u2019s consti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>tutional authority to regulate the conditions of employment for employees in the classified state civil service. We do not misunderstand the majority\u2019s argument: the majority itself observes that a ratified collective bargaining agreement does not establish the conditions of employment for classified state employees. That collective bargaining agreement is only the starting point for the commission\u2019s purposes, because it must accept, reject, or modify the agreement during its own internal review process. Only when approved by <em>the </em>commission\u2014using the Legislature\u2019s appropriation\u2014 does a collective bargaining agreement actually establish the conditions of employment.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The majority\u2019s analysis conflates the collective bargaining <em>negotiation </em>process, which is external to the commission, with the commission\u2019s own process for <em>approving </em>a collective bargaining agreement. In reviewing, and then accepting, rejecting, or modifying the collective bargaining agreement, the commission must still \u201cregulate particularized \u2018conditions of employment for the eligible employees in the applicable unit.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">Indeed, in alleging that the commission \u201cfoist [s] the administrative costs\u201d of establishing the conditions of employment onto employees, the majority ignores the fact that the employees <em>themselves </em>have chosen, for better or worse, to organize and select an exclusive representative.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Similarly, the employees themselves can change a bargaining unit\u2019s exclusive representative\u2014or dispense with the collective bargaining process entirely, if they believe that the costs of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>agency fees do not warrant further representation.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> If the employees choose the latter approach, the commission\u2019s rules establish that any existing collective bargaining agreement is \u201cimmediately void and the unit members are subject to the rates of compensation and other conditions of employment applicable to other nonexclusively represented employees.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Once that occurs, the employer \u201cshall not deduct dues or service fees from any classified employee . . . except dues and service fees deducted through the pay period in which the decertification is issued.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">That the nature of the commission\u2019s authority to promulgate Rule 6-7.2 is policy-driven and not a quasi-tax or quasi-appropriation is further supported in the legislative history of the Right to Work law itself. From 1973 until 2012, the Legislature explicitly permitted employers of <em>nonclassified </em>public employees to require similar agency fees.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Moreover, while 2012 PA 349 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>purported to ban the imposition of agency fees on most public employees,<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> it exempted this prohibition with regard to \u201cpublic police or fire department employee [s]\u201d and \u201cstate police trooper [s] or sergeant [s].\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> The Legislature\u2019s policy decision to do so was an exercise of its authority to \u201cenact laws providing for the resolution of disputes concerning public employees\u201d outside of the classified civil service<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> or to \u201cenact laws relative to the . . . conditions of employment,\u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> not its authority to tax or appropriate.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b538-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>Indeed, the majority\u2019s analysis fails on its own terms. Even assuming (as we do not) the majority\u2019s premise that agency fees are \u201cfoisted on\u201d employees, the commission has the explicit authority to \u201cfix rates of compensation for all classes of positions,\u201d subject only to a legislative override for compensation increases.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> As a result, the commission has the absolute authority to <em>reduce </em>employees\u2019 compensation, and the majority likewise ignores the effect that mandatory agency fees have on reducing a bargaining unit\u2019s compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">The majority\u2019s decision is an untested application of state constitutional law that may well yield unintended consequences. If the commission\u2019s rule\u2014merely authorizing, and not <em>requiring, </em>agency fees to appear in collective bargaining agreements\u2014is an unconstitutional appropriation, then what other conditions of employment are subject to invalidation by this Court as improper \u201cappropriations\u201d? Because I prefer a more straightforward application of our Constitution, I dissent from the majority\u2019s conclusion and instead would hold that Rule 6-7.2 is a constitutional exercise of the commission\u2019s authority to regulate the conditions of employment and to determine the qualifications of employees in the classified civil service.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">II. LIMITS OF LEGISLATIVE AUTHORITY</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">By invalidating Rule 6-7.2 as beyond the scope of the commission\u2019s constitutional authority, the majority avoids the issue that divided the Court of Appeals and that was actually presented to this Court: whether the Legislature has the authority to invalidate the policy created by Rule 6-7.2 by enacting a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>conflicting statute\u2014namely, 2012 PA 349. For the following reasons, I would hold that article 4, \u00a7 48 precludes 2012 PA 349 from applying to employees in the state classified civil service and that, instead, Rule 6-7.2 continues to apply to employees in the state classified civil service.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">Article 4, \u00a7 48 provides the Legislature with the discretionary authority to \u201cenact laws providing for the resolution of disputes concerning public employees, except those in the state classified civil service.\u201d This exception to the legislative power is crucial because it demonstrates that the drafters and ratifiers understood the commission as having the <em>exclusive </em>role in resolving disputes concerning employees in the classified service. Moreover, the Constitutional Convention\u2019s Address to the People specifically indicates that \u201c[t]he state classified civil service is exempted\u201d from Article 4, \u00a7 48 \u201cbecause the constitution has specific provisions in this area,\u201d namely, Article 11, \u00a7 5.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">As explained earlier, an agency fee is adopted as part of the collective bargaining process and involves an employee\u2019s payment to the exclusive representative in lieu of membership dues. The collective bargaining process, culminating in a collective bargaining agreement, delineates and memorializes how the employer and employee will resolve disputes or grievances, including the role that the exclusive representative has in resolving those disputes or grievances.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> In other words, agency fees are intended not just to pay for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>collective bargaining process that determines employees\u2019 rights, but also to pay for the services rendered by the exclusive representative on behalf of a classified employee in matters such as \u201cthe resolution of disputes concerning public employees\u201d that arise under the collective bargaining agreement.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> As a result, the Legislature\u2019s attempt to abolish the agency fee rule runs afoul of article 4, \u00a7 48 to the extent that it seeks to regulate employment relations for a class of individuals who have been expressly exempted from such regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">The fact that agency fees are directly paid to the employees\u2019 exclusive representative is crucial to this conclusion because it directly ties those fees to the specific exclusion of legislative authority in Article 4, \u00a7 48. If Rule 6-7.2 were to require a payment to an organization that is unaffiliated with the collective bargaining or employee grievance process\u2014whether a charitable organization, a civic organization, or a political organization\u2014then Article 4, \u00a7 48 would not prohibit the Legislature\u2019s attempt to ban those payments. But, when the commission\u2019s agency fee rule defines the relationship between an employee and his or her exclusive representative, an attempt by the Legislature to override such a rule is limited by the exclusion of state classified employees from the Legislature\u2019s Article 4, \u00a7 48 powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">For the reasons stated, I respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s decision to affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals on alternative grounds. Instead, I would uphold the authority of the commission to promulgate the agency fee rule, reverse the judgment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>the Court of Appeals, and hold that Article 4, \u00a7 48 precludes 2012 PA 349 from applying to employees in the state classified civil service.</p>\n<judges id=\"b541-5\">McCormack and Bernstein, JJ., concurred with Kelly, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b528-7\"> Const 1963, art 11, \u00a7 5; see also <em>Dudkin v Civil Serv Comm, </em>127 Mich App 397, 408-409; 339 NW2d 190 (1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b528-8\"> Const 1963, art 4, \u00a7 48.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b528-9\"> Const 1963, art 11, \u00a7 5.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b529-7\"> The provision, as initially enacted, did not refer to \u201ccompetitive examination and performance,\u201d only \u201ccompetitive performance.\u201d Const 1908, art 6, \u00a7 22.

Rule 6-7.2 bears on the efficiency of civil service operations: by enacting a rule that conditions continued employment either on membership in a union or on payment of an agency fee, the commission has determined that negotiating with a single exclusive representative, rather than employees individually, enhances the efficiency of the classified civil service. <em>Dudkin, </em>127 Mich App at 408-409. Importantly, this Court has interpreted the term \u201ccandidates for positions\u201d to include those already employed in civil service positions, and therefore the criterion of efficiency applies to existing employees, such as those covered by Rule 6-7.2. <em>Reed v Civil Serv Comm, </em>301 Mich 137, 159; 3 NW2d 41 (1942).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b534-9\"> In the same way, Civ Serv R 6-9.2 regulates the collective bargaining process by requiring the state personnel director to \u201cestablish a time frame for the conduct of primary negotiations and impasse resolution.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b535-6\"> See Civ Serv R 6-2.1(d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b535-7\"> <em>Ante </em>at 296 n 6, quoting Civ Serv R 6-2.1(d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b535-8\"> <em>Ante </em>at 296.

Indeed, if collective bargaining did not exist at all, the commission would simply apply these default rates of compensation and conditions to all classified employees. The collective bargaining process proposes an <em>alternative </em>to those default rates of compensation and conditions of employment, and the commission must review that alternative proposal and accept, reject, or revise using the funds appropriated to it from Article 11, \u00a7 5. This review would occur <em>regardless </em>of whether agency fees existed and shows that, while the commission has established a policy to allow collective bargaining, it does not benefit either from the collective bargaining process or from the agency fees that employees pay their exclusive representative.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b536-9\"> Civ Serv R 6-6.3(e)(3).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b536-10\"> Former MCL 423.210(l)(c) was enacted by 1973 PA 25 and stated</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-11\">[t]hat nothing in this act or in any law of this state shall preclude a public employer from making an agreement with an exclusive bargaining representative ... to require as a condition of employment that all employees in the bargaining unit pay to the exclusive bargaining representative a service fee equivalent to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>the amount of dues uniformly required of members of the exclusive bargaining representative!.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">This provision was upheld by the United States Supreme Court against a First Amendment challenge in <em>Abood v Detroit Bd of Ed, </em>431 US 209; 97 S Ct 1782; 52 L Ed 261 (1977).
