However, the UTA exempts from the use tax property sold to \u201c[a]n industrial processor for use or consumption in industrial processing.\u201d MCL 205.94o(l)(a). At issue here is whether and to what extent, if any, an electric utility is entitled to the industrial-processing exemption for tangible personal property located outside its generation plants. The Court of Appeals held that plaintiff was entitled to the full industrial-processing exemption for the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">We hold that the property here is simultaneously used for exempt \u201cindustrial processing\u201d activity under MCL 205.94o(7)(a) and nonexempt \u201cdistribution\u201d and \u201cshipping\u201d activities under MCL 205.94o(6)(b). In these circumstances, the taxpayer is entitled to the industrial-processing exemption based on the \u201cpercentage of exempt use to total use determined by a reasonable formula or method approved by the [Department of Treasury].\u201d MCL 205.94o(2). Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals in part, reverse in part, and remand to the Court of Claims for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>I. PACTS AND HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\">Plaintiff, Detroit Edison Company (DTE), is an electric utility that is responsible for generating, transmitting, and distributing electricity to residential, commercial, and industrial consumers. The electricity is initially generated at approximately 15,000 to 25,000 volts within each of plaintiffs generation plants. However, to transmit electricity throughout the electric system, plaintiff must then \u201cstep up\u201d the voltage to between 115,000 and 500,000 volts as the electricity is transmitted from the generation plant to substations from which the electricity is then distributed to consumers.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">Electricity is not usable at the high voltage levels at which it exists when it is initially generated and as it moves throughout the electric system. For instance, most residential consumers use electricity at the 120/240 volt<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> level. For this reason, the electric system employs tangible personal property, such as transformers, at the substations to \u201cstep down\u201d the voltage as the electricity nears the consumer. In addition to transformers, the electric system employs a variety of other tangible personal property, including fuses, circuit breakers, cables, and poles, to monitor the voltage levels and ensure that the consumer receives a useable product.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">Defendant conducted a use-tax audit for the period between January 1, 2003, and September 30, 2006, and determined that plaintiff had a deficiency because it had claimed the industrial-processing exemption from the use tax for tangible personal property located <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>outside its generation plants.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, defendant issued a notice of intent to assess in the amount of $11,020,506 in tax plus interest\u2014an amount that was subsequently corrected upward to $14,046,249 plus interest. Ultimately, defendant issued a final assessment in the amount of $13,102,133.54 plus interest. Plaintiff paid the deficiency under protest and filed suit in the Court of Claims, seeking a refund for the use tax and interest paid under protest, as well as statutory costs, interest, and attorney fees.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The parties filed competing motions for summary disposition under MCR 2.116(C)(10). The Court of Claims eventually granted summary disposition in favor of plaintiff, reasoning that it was clear \u201cthat electricity is continuing to be processed up until the point at which it reaches the customer\u2019s meter, because the voltage and current levels are drastically changed multiple times at set points, the last being at or near the customer\u2019s meter . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">Defendant appealed, and the Court of Appeals affirmed. <em>Detroit Edison Co v Dep\u2019t of Treasury, </em>303 Mich App 612; 844 NW2d 198 (2014). The Court of Appeals held that the \u201cmachinery and equipment are concurrently used in a unified system for purposes of both distribution <em>and </em>industrial processing. In such a situation, the caselaw is clear that the \u2018industrial process-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>mg\u2019 exemption applies to the machinery and equipment <em>in full.\u201d Id. </em>at 630. We granted defendant\u2019s application for leave to appeal in this Court. <em>Detroit Edison Co v Dep\u2019t of Treasury, </em>497 Mich 873 (2014). Oral arguments were heard on April 7, 2015.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">II. STANDARD OP REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">\u201cA trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion for summary disposition is a question of law, which this Court reviews de novo.\u201d <em>Shepherd Montessori Ctr Milan v Ann Arbor Charter Twp, </em>486 Mich 311, 317; 783 NW2d 695 (2010).

USE TAX AND EXEMPTION</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">The UTA \u201cimposes a 6% tax on a consumer\u2019s use, storage, and consumption of all tangible personal property in Michigan.\u201d <em>Andrie Inc v Dep\u2019t of Treasury, </em>496 Mich 161, 164; 853 NW2d 310 (2014). At the time relevant to this case, MCL 205.93(1) of the UTA provided in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-9\">There is levied upon and there shall be collected from every person in this state a specific tax for the privilege of using, storing, or consuming tangible personal property in this state at a rate equal to 6% of the price of the property or services ....

Industrial processing begins when tangible personal property begins movement from raw materials storage to begin industrial processing and ends when finished goods first come to rest in finished goods inventory storage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-6\">(b) \u201cIndustrial processor\u201d means a person who performs the activity of converting or conditioning tangible personal property for ultimate sale at retail or use in the manufacturing of a product to be ultimately sold at retail. [As enacted by 1999 PA 117.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">\u201cThe industrial processing exemption is, in part, the product of a targeted legislative effort to avoid double taxation of the end product offered for retail sale or, in other terms, to avoid \u2018pyramiding the use and sales tax.\u2019 \u201d <em>Elias Bros Restaurants, Inc v Treasury Dep\u2019t, </em>452 Mich 144, 152; 549 NW2d 837 (1996), quoting <em>Int\u2019l Research &amp; Dev Corp v Dep\u2019t of Revenue, </em>25 Mich App 8, 13; 181 NW2d 53 (1970). \u201cPyramiding occurs when both use and sales taxes are imposed on the production and sale of retail goods.\u201d <em>Elias Bros, </em>452 Mich at 152. \u201c[T]o determine whether the industrial processing exemption applies, it is necessary to consider the <em>activity </em>in which the equipment is engaged and not the <em>character </em>of the equipment-owner\u2019s business.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 157 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">MCL 205.92 of the UTA specifically provides that electricity constitutes \u201ctangible personal property.\u201d Effective July 23, 2002, MCL <em>205.92(l) </em>read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>\u201cTangible personal property\u201d beginning September 20, 1999, includes electricity, natural or artificial gas, or steam and also the transmission and distribution of electricity used by the consumer or user of the electricity, whether the electricity is purchased from the delivering utility or from another provider. [As amended by 2002 PA 511.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">Effective September 1, 2004, MCL 205.92(k) reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-5\">\u201cTangible personal property\u201d means personal property that can be seen, weighed, measured, felt, or touched or that is in any other manner perceptible to the senses and includes electricity, water, gas, steam, and prewritten computer software. [As amended by 2004 PA 172.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">Accordingly, there is no dispute that electricity constitutes \u201ctangible personal property\u201d for purposes of the industrial-processing exemption.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> MCL 205.92. In addition, there is no dispute that plaintiff is an \u201cindustrial processor\u201d because by generating electricity it \u201cperforms the activity of converting or conditioning tangible personal property for ultimate sale at retail . . . .\u201d MCL 205.94o(7)(b). With that in mind, we address whether plaintiffs tangible personal property outside the generation plants is exempt from the use tax under the industrial-processing exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">We start with a discussion of \u201cindustrial processing\u201d under MCL 205.94o(7)(a) and only then address MCL 205.94o(2) for three reasons. First, the introductory sentence of MCL 205.94o(2) provides that \u201c[t]he property under subsection (1) is exempt only to the extent that the property is used for the exempt purpose stated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>in this section.\u201d Therefore, before addressing the second sentence of MCL 205.94o(2), it is initially necessary to assess whether and to what extent the property is used for the \u201cexempt purpose,\u201d i.e., industrial processing. This is the threshold inquiry required by the first sentence of MCL 205.94o(2), and MCL 205.94o(7)(a) defines \u201cindustrial processing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\">Second, the next sentence of MCL 205.94o(2) provides that \u201c[t]he exemption is limited to the percentage of exempt use to total use determined by a reasonable formula or method approved by the department.\u201d Thus, similarly to the introductory sentence of MCL 205.94o(2), the second sentence requires an initial assessment of whether and to what extent property is put to the \u201cexempt use\u201d of industrial processing.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">Third, the overall concern of the industrial-processing exemption, MCL 205.94o, is, of course, industrial processing. It is only logical, therefore, to first determine whether \u201cindustrial processing\u201d has occurred. Because \u201cindustrial processing\u201d is defined by MCL 205.94o(7)(a), the analysis begins there. If \u201cindustrial processing\u201d activity is not occurring under either MCL 205.94o(7)(a) or MCL 205.94o(3), the latter of which specifically enumerates certain activities that constitute \u201cindustrial processing,\u201d the analysis is complete and the taxpayer is entitled to no exemption. On the other hand, if \u201cindustrial processing\u201d activity is occurring, it is then necessary to analyze the remaining provisions of MCL 205.94o, including but not limited to Subsection (2), to determine the measure of the exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">B. INDUSTRIAL PROCESSING</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">The initial consideration is whether altering the voltage of the electricity after it is transmitted by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>generation plant satisfies the definition of \u201cindustrial processing\u201d under MCL 205.94o(7)(a). Again, this provision states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-5\">\u201cIndustrial processing\u201d means the activity of converting or conditioning tangible personal property by changing the form, composition, quality, combination, or character of the property for ultimate sale at retail.... Industrial processing begins when tangible personal property begins movement from raw materials storage to begin industrial processing and ends when finished goods first come to rest in finished goods inventory storage. [MCL 205.94o(7)(a).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">The first inquiry under MCL 205.94o(7)(a) is whether altering the voltage satisfies the first sentence, <em>to wit, </em>whether altering the voltage constitutes \u201cconverting or conditioning [electricity] by changing the form, composition, quality, combination, or character. . . for ultimate sale at retail.\u201d Because these words are undefined by statute, it is appropriate to consult a dictionary. <em>Krohn v Home-Owners Ins Co, </em>490 Mich 145, 156; 802 NW2d 281 (2011) (\u201cWe may consult dictionary definitions to give words their common and ordinary meaning.\u201d). \u201cCondition\u201d means \u201cto put in a fit or proper state.\u201d <em>Random House Webster\u2019s College Dictionary </em>(1997). \u201cQuality\u201d means \u201can essential characteristic, property, or attribute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cCharacter\u201d means \u201cthe aggregate of features and traits that form the individual nature of a person or thing.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">We conclude that altering the voltage \u201ccondition [s]\u201d the electricity \u201cfor ultimate sale at retail.\u201d MCL 205.94o(7)(a). The industrial-processing exemption inquires whether tangible personal property constitutes a \u201cfinished good.\u201d MCL 205.94o(7)(a). The parties\u2019 various experts agree that the voltage levels at which the electricity is initially generated are not in their final form, such that they would be appropriate for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>ordinary use by the consumer.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thus, altering the voltage \u201cconditions\u201d the electricity for ultimate sale at retail because the electricity is not \u201cfinished\u201d and, therefore, not suitable for consumption until that voltage has been lowered.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">Furthermore, altering the voltage transforms the \u201cquality\u201d and \u201ccharacter\u201d of the electricity. The parties\u2019 experts agree that the tangible personal property generated by plaintiff\u2014-whether it is characterized as \u201celectricity\u201d or \u201celectric power\u201d\u2014is composed of both voltage and current. Put simply, electricity is measured, at least in part, by voltage. Because electricity is measured in this way, voltage is an essential attribute, and an inherent feature, of electricity. Altering the voltage therefore alters the \u201cquality\u201d and \u201ccharacter\u201d of the electricity. Accordingly, altering the voltage constitutes an industrial-processing activity by satisfying the initial sentence of MCL 205.94o(7)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">The next inquiry required under MCL 205.94o(7)(a) is whether the industrial processing of the electricity outside the generation plant satisfies the second sentence, which provides that \u201c[ijndustrial processing begins when tangible personal property begins movement from raw materials storage to begin industrial processing and ends when finished goods first come to rest in finished goods inventory storage.\u201d Defendant does not dispute that industrial processing begins before the electricity has been transmitted from the generation plant. And defendant has identified no point at which the electricity comes to rest in inventory storage. And nowhere does the record otherwise suggest that electricity ever comes to rest in inventory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>storage. Moreover, electricity is never a \u201cfinished good\u201d until the voltage has been reduced to a level approximating 120/240 volts for the typical residential consumer and 480 volts for the typical industrial consumer. We conclude as a result that industrial processing of electricity does not become complete until final distribution to the <em>consumer </em>because there is simply no point within the electric system at which \u201cfinished goods first come to rest in finished goods inventory storage\u201d before that point.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">For these reasons, the industrial processing of electricity under MCL 205.94o(7)(a) occurs throughout the electric system from its initial generation until its final distribution to the consumer.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We therefore affirm the Court of Appeals\u2019 conclusion that the electric system is used for exempt \u201cindustrial processing\u201d activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">C. DISTRIBUTION AND SHIPPING</p>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">The second consideration is whether the equipment is somehow <em>excluded </em>from the industrial-processing exemption by MCL 205.94o(6)(b), which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>(6) Industrial processing does not include the following activities:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAqnU\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-4\">(b) Sales, distribution, warehousing, shipping, or advertising activities.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">\u201cDistribution\u201d describes \u201can act or instance of distributing,\u201d <em>Random House Webster\u2019s College Dictionary </em>(1997), and \u201cshipping\u201d describes \u201cthe act or business of a person or thing that ships goods,\u201d <em>id. </em>The electric system moves electricity from each substation, either to other substations, or to the consumer. This movement, or flow, of electricity constitutes \u201cdistribution\u201d and \u201cshipping\u201d of the electricity from the generation plant to the consumer. Thus, the electric system is involved in \u201cdistribution\u201d and \u201cshipping\u201d activities, and industrial processing \u201cdoes not include\u201d these activities. MCL 205.94o(6)(b). Accordingly, from the time when electricity leaves the generation plant until it is finally distributed to the consumer, the electric system is <em>simultaneously </em>involved in \u201cindustrial processing activity\u2019 under MCL 205.94o(7)(a) and \u201cdistribution\u201d and \u201cshipping\u201d activities under MCL 205.94o(6)(b). We therefore also affirm the Court of Appeals\u2019 conclusion that the electric system is simultaneously used for exempt and nonexempt activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">Defendant argues that when \u201can activity is \u2018industrial processing\u2019 under [MCL 205.94o(7)(a)], but when a specified \u2018exclusion\u2019 applies, it will take the activity outside of the exemption.\u201d That is, defendant argues, distribution and shipping are \u201cspecific modifier [s]\u201d to the general definition of industrial processing. See <em>In re </em>Haley, 476 Mich 180, 198; 720 NW2d 246 (2006) (\u201c[I]t is a settled rule of statutory construction that where a statute contains a specific statutory provision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>and a related, but more general, provision, the specific one controls.\u201d)- See also <em>Ter Beek v City of Wyoming, </em>495 Mich 1, 22; 846 NW2d 531 (2014) (\u201cIt is well accepted that when two legislative enactments seemingly conflict, the specific provision prevails over the more general provision.\u201d). We respectfully disagree with defendant\u2019s analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">The \u201cgeneral/specific\u201d rule of statutory interpretation, although a longstanding and honorable interpretative canon, is utterly inapplicable in this case. It is a rule that applies only in circumstances in which some subject in dispute has been removed, or carved out from, a general category of treatment, to which it would <em>otherwise </em>belong, and placed within a more narrow category of treatment to which it belongs by specific definition, <em>to wit, </em>in those circumstances in which the statutory issue is presented in the following form: should the subject in dispute be treated in accordance with the general category to which it belongs or in accordance with the more specific category to which it also belongs? See <em>In re Landaal, </em>273 Mich 248, 252; 262 NW2d 897 (1935), quoting <em>Crane v Reeder, </em>22 Mich 322, 334 (1871):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-5\">[WJhere there are two acts or provisions, one of which is special and particular, and certainly includes the matter in question, and the other general, which, if standing alone, would include the same matter and thus conflict with the special act or provision, the special must be taken as intended to constitute an exception to the general act or provision .... [Quotation marks omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">That is, the rule only applies when there is some statutory tension or conflict between two possible treatments of a subject, e.g., when an agricultural statute sets different tax rates for \u201cfruits\u201d and \u201capples.\u201d There is no such conflict or tension here. Rather, there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>are subjects or activities (\u201cindustrial processing\u201d) that fall within the category of \u201cindustrial processing,\u201d and there are other subjects or activities (\u201cdistribution\u201d and \u201cshipping\u201d) that do not fall within the category of \u201cindustrial processing.\u201d These categories are separate and distinct, and there is nothing to suggest that one category can be viewed as being more \u201cgeneral\u201d or \u201cspecific\u201d than the other. In short, the nonexempt activities in MCL 205.94o(6)(b) are in no way within the scope of MCL 205.94o(7)(a), and the exempt activity in MCL 205.94o(7)(a) is in no way within the scope of MCL 205.94o(6)(b). Accordingly, there is no hierarchy among tax categories, no conflict or tension as to the treatment of any specific activity, and, for the reasons set forth later in Part III(E) of this opinion, no \u201call or nothing\u201d conferral of the tax exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">D. RULE 65</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">Defendant also argues that plaintiff is not entitled to the industrial-processing exemption by operation of Mich Admin Code, R 205.115(4)\u2014known as Rule 65(4) of the Specific Sales and Use Tax Rules promulgated by defendant. The rule was enacted under MCL 24.207 of the Administrative Procedures Act<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> with the force of law. See <em>Danse Corp v Madison Hts, </em>466 Mich 175, 181; 644 NW2d 721 (2002) (\u201cIn order for an agency regulation ... of general applicability to have the force of law, it must fall under the definition of a properly promulgated rule.\u201d). Rule 65(4) reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-6\">The sale of tangible personal property consumed or used in the transmission or distribution of electricity, gas, or steam is taxable. Such transmission or distribution starts at the place where the product leaves the immediate premises from which it is manufactured.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>Under Rule 65(4), the use tax may be applied to the electric system because the electric system is \u201ctangible personal property . . . used in the transmission or distribution of electricity . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Nonetheless, and despite the fact that Rule 65(4) is a \u201cproperly promulgated rule,\u201d it does not control the outcome of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">\u201cPerhaps the most fundamental aspect of the \u2018legislative power\u2019... is the power to tax and to appropriate for specified purposes.\u201d <em>46th Circuit Trial Court v Crawford Co, </em>476 Mich 131, 141; 719 NW2d 553 (2006). \u201c[AJgencies cannot exercise legislative power by creating law or changing the laws enacted by the Legislature.\u201d <em>In re Complaint of Rovas Against SBC Mich, </em>482 Mich 90, 98; 754 NW2d 259 (2008). Therefore, when the Legislature has exempted certain tangible personal property from the use tax by enacting MCL 205.94o, defendant cannot impose the use tax on that property through the rulemaking process. See <em>R C Mahon Co v Dep\u2019t of Revenue, </em>306 Mich 660, 666; 11 NW2d 280 (1943) (\u201c[L]iability for payment of the sales (and use) tax is controlled by statute. It cannot be imposed by rulings or regulations of the board (department.)\u201d) (citation and quotation marks omitted). As explained in Part III(C) of this opinion, we conclude that plaintiff is entitled to the industrial-processing exemption for the electric system under MCL 205.94o\u2014at least in part\u2014because exempt industrial-processing activity and nonexempt activities <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>are occurring simultaneously. MCL 205.94o(2) contemplates that in such a situation the taxpayer is entitled to <em>some </em>measure of an exemption. Rule 65(4), on the other hand, may be read to provide that the electric system is entirely taxable. Accordingly, Rule 65(4) directly conflicts with MCL 205.94o to the extent that the rule can be read to deprive electric utilities, such as plaintiff, of the entirety of the industrial-processing exemption for tangible personal property located outside the generation plants. Because defendant cannot through the rulemaking process \u201cchang[e] the laws enacted by the Legislature,\u201d <em>In re Complaint of Rovas, </em>482 Mich at 98, MCL 205.94o is controlling and Rule 65(4) is invalid to the extent it is in conflict with MCL 205.94o. We again affirm the Court of Appeals\u2019 conclusion in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">E. APPORTIONMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">To reiterate, the electric system is used for tax-exempt activity under MCL 205.94o(7)(a), as well as for nonexempt activities under MCL 205.94o(6)(b). Furthermore, Rule 65(4) does not govern the outcome of this case. The next consideration is whether, and to what extent, the tax on the electric system may be apportioned between exempt and nonexempt activities under MCL 205.94o(2).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">Once again, MCL 205.94o(2) reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-7\">The property under subsection (1) is exempt only to the extent that the property is used for the exempt purpose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>stated in this section. The exemption is limited to the percentage of exempt use to total use determined by a reasonable formula or method approved by the department.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">The electric system is used for \u201cthe exempt purpose stated in this section\u201d\u2014industrial processing\u2014until that point at which the electricity is finally distributed to the consumer. This is because MCL 205.94o(7)(a) provides that \u201c[industrial processing. . . ends when finished goods first come to rest in finished goods inventory storage,\u201d and as already observed, electricity never comes to rest in finished goods inventory storage; rather, it continues to be processed until final delivery is made to the consumer. Industrial processing therefore occurs throughout the electric system<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> under MCL 205.94o(7)(a).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Furthermore, as already explained, nonexempt \u201cdistribution\u201d and \u201cshipping\u201d activities under MCL 205.94o(6)(b) also occur throughout the electric system until final delivery is made to the consumer. Accordingly, because the electric system is simultaneously used for both exempt and nonexempt activities, it is necessary to consider MCL 205.94o(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">MCL 205.94o(2) provides in relevant part that \u201c[t]he property under subsection (1) is exempt only to the extent that the property is used for the exempt purpose stated in this section.\u201d The electric system satisfies MCL 205.94o(l) because plaintiff is an \u201cindustrial processor\u201d and, as explained previously, the electric system is used for \u201cindustrial processing.\u201d See MCL 205.94o(l)(a) (stating that the tax levied under the UTA does not apply to property sold to \u201c[a]n industrial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>processor for use or consumption in industrial processing\u201d). Moreover, the only conceivable \u201cexempt purpose\u201d of MCL 205.94o is industrial processing, and as a result, the electric system is exempt from the use tax \u201conly to the extent that [it] is used for\u201d industrial processing.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\">To identify the extent to which the electric system is used for industrial processing, MCL 205.94o(2) further provides that the exemption \u201cis limited to the percentage of exempt use to total use . . . .\u201d The term \u201cexempt use\u201d refers to use of the property for industrial-processing activity because industrial-processing activity is the <em>only </em>exempt activity identified in MCL 205.94o.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Therefore, \u201ctotal use\u201d must refer to the aggregate use of the property for exempt activity and all other activities. That is, \u201ctotal use\u201d is the sum of the property\u2019s uses for all exempt and nonexempt activities. Whether those two types of activities happen to occur simultaneously is irrelevant to the statutory apportionment scheme. And as a simple matter of mathematics, \u201ctotal use\u201d\u2014the sum of <em>all </em>uses\u2014must equal 100%. We therefore reverse the Court of Appeals to the extent that it concluded that plaintiff was entitled to the industrial-processing exemption for the entire electric system.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>To determine the \u201cpercentage of exempt use to total use,\u201d MCL 205.94o(2), it is necessary to ascertain both the use of the property for exempt activity and the sum of the uses of the property for exempt and nonexempt activities. Then, the \u201cpercentage of exempt use to total use\u201d must be determined on the basis of \u201ca reasonable formula or method approved by the department.\u201d MCL 205.94o(2). Once this percentage has been identified, the industrial-processing exemption \u201cis limited to\u201d this percentage. <em>Id,.</em><footnotemark><em>15</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">In the case at hand, the record shows that the \u201cexempt use\u201d of the electric system includes, at a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>minimum, alteration of the voltage under MCL 205.94o(7)(a).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> And \u201ctotal use\u201d of the electric system is the sum of the uses for such exempt activity plus the nonexempt \u201cdistribution\u201d and \u201cshipping\u201d activities under MCL 205.94o(6)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">To be clear, we do not purport to recite a formula that applies to this case or any other case. Rather, MCL 205.94o(2) is quite clear that the \u201creasonable formula or method\u201d must be \u201capproved by the [Department of Treasury].\u201d We simply hold that under MCL 205.94o(2), when property is simultaneously used for both exempt and nonexempt activities, defendant must give some recognition to both exempt and nonexempt activity in calculating \u201ctotal use\u201d under MCL 205.94o(2). That is, defendant cannot conclude under the statute that the nonexempt activity or activities wholly trump the exempt activity. Conversely, defendant cannot conclude under the statute that the exempt activity wholly trumps the nonexempt activity or activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">We emphasize defendant\u2019s role in approving \u201ca <em>reasonable </em>formula or method\u201d to determine the \u201cpercentage of exempt use to total use\u201d pursuant to MCL 205.94o(2) (emphasis added). The \u201cpercentage of exempt use to total use\u201d will in many cases be a highly fact-specific inquiry that depends on a multitude of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>considerations, and we do not intend to suggest that apportionment under MCL 205.94o(2) can be ascertained and applied without regard to the unique character and extent of the various uses of the property.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">Defendant has contended throughout these proceedings that plaintiff is not entitled to any industrial-processing exemption for the electric system. For the reasons explained herein, we disagree because the electric system is simultaneously used for exempt and nonexempt activities and MCL 205.94o(2) provides that plaintiff is entitled to the industrial-processing exemption on the basis of the \u201cpercentage of exempt use to total use\u201d of the electric system. This percentage is to be \u201cdetermined by a reasonable formula or method approved by the [Department of Treasury].\u201d Because the electric system is used for at least some exempt activity relative to total activity, defendant\u2019s determination that plaintiff is not entitled to any industrial-processing exemption is inconsistent with MCL 205.94o(2). Therefore, we remand to the Court of Claims for defendant to approve a \u201creasonable formula or method\u201d for determining the \u201cpercentage of exempt use to total use\u201d consistent with the principles set forth in this opinion and subject to the initial review of the Court of Claims.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b283-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>IV. RESPONSE TO DISSENT</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\">According to the dissent, \u201c[t]he purpose of what DTE claims as industrial processing is . . . simply a means of distributing its product\u2014electric power\u2014most efficiently, not a means of producing a different product.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 61. We respectfully disagree. The electricity is initially generated at about 15,000 to 25,000 volts, so the voltage must necessarily be altered before a useable product has been made available. Therefore, even assuming for the sake of argument that the \u201cpurpose,\u201d as opposed to the physical reality, of an activity is determinative with regard to whether a taxpayer is entitled to the industrial-processing exemption, see MCL 205.94o(2), altering the voltage of electricity to render it usable by customers fully serves an industrial-processing purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">The dissent concludes that altering the voltage does not constitute \u201cindustrial processing\u201d activity under MCL 205.94o(7)(a) because \u201c[t]he fundamental nature of electricity\u2014the flow of electrons\u2014is not fundamentally altered after leaving the production facility.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 62. We disagree because \u201cindustrial processing\u201d activity under MCL 205.94o(7)(a) is not limited to those situations in which the \u201cfundamental nature\u201d of the tangible personal property at issue\u2014 here, electricity\u2014is \u201cfundamentally altered.\u201d Rather, \u201cindustrial processing\u201d activity under MCL 205.94o(7)(a) is defined more broadly to encompass actions that result in \u201cchanging the form, composition, quality, combination, or character\u201d of the property. In our view, such changes unquestionably take place in the instant circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">We also believe that the dissent errs by failing to give meaning to the <em>entire </em>definition of \u201cindustrial processing,\u201d in particular the language providing that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>\u201c[industrial processing. . . ends when finished goods <em>first come to rest in finished goods inventory storage.\u201d </em>MCL 205.94o(7)(a) (emphasis added). Even if the dissent is correct that electricity constitutes a \u201cfinished good\u201d at the moment it leaves the generation plant\u2014 notwithstanding that it is altogether unusable by any actual consumer until final delivery\u2014there is no point at which electricity \u201cfirst come[s] to rest in finished goods inventory storage.\u201d By concluding that \u201cindustrial processing\u201d activity under MCL 205.94o(7)(a) ends when electricity leaves the generation plant, the dissent reads the language \u201cfirst come[s] to rest in finished goods inventory storage\u201d out of the statute entirely, contrary to all traditional rules of statutory interpretation. See <em>Hannay v Dep\u2019t ofTransp, </em>497 Mich 45, 57; 860 NW2d 67 (2014) (\u201c[C]ourts must give effect to every word, phrase, and clause in a statute and avoid an interpretation that renders nugatory or sur-plusage any part of a statute.\u201d) (citation and quotation marks omitted).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">Furthermore, we also disagree with the dissent because it fails to take into account that tangible personal property can be <em>simultaneously </em>used for exempt \u201cindustrial processing\u201d activity under MCL 205.94o(7)(a) and MCL 205.94o(3) and nonexempt \u201cdistribution\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>\u201cshipping\u201d activities under MCL 205.94o(6)(b). There is no language in the industrial-processing statute that provides that the use of tangible personal property for one or more nonexempt activities forecloses the simultaneous use of that same property for exempt \u201cindustrial processing\u201d activity. Accordingly, the activities enumerated in MCL 205.94o(6)(b) are not \u201cspecific modifier [s]\u201d to the \u201cgeneral definition\u201d of industrial processing set forth in MCL 205.94o(7)(a), as defendant suggests. Rather, MCL 205.94o(6) sets forth those activities that do <em>not </em>constitute \u201cindustrial processing,\u201d and MCL 205.94o(7)(a) and MCL 205.94o(3) set forth the activity that <em>does </em>constitute \u201cindustrial processing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">V. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">The industrial-processing exemption provides that it is applicable to \u201cthe activity of converting or conditioning tangible personal property by changing the form, composition, quality, combination, or character of the property for ultimate sale at retail.... Industrial processing . . . ends when finished goods first come to rest in finished goods inventory storage.\u201d MCL 205.94o(7)(a). Altering the voltage \u201ccondition[s]\u201d the electricity by changing its \u201cquality\u201d and \u201ccharacter\u201d \u201cfor ultimate sale at retail.\u201d Furthermore, electricity is not a \u201cfinished good\u201d until it is set at a usable voltage, and it does not \u201ccome to rest in finished goods inventory storage\u201d at any point throughout the electric system. Industrial processing therefore occurs throughout the electric system. Because exempt and nonexempt activities are simultaneously occurring, it is necessary to determine the \u201cpercentage of exempt use to total use\u201d by identifying and comparing the use of the property for exempt activity with the use of the property for all activities, both exempt and nonexempt. MCL 205.94o(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>This percentage must be determined on the basis of a \u201creasonable formula or method approved by the [Department of Treasury].\u201d <em>Id. </em>The record has not been sufficiently developed in this regard. Therefore, a remand to the trial court is necessary for defendant to approve a \u201creasonable formula or method\u201d to determine the percentage of plaintiffs exempt use to total use of the electric system and, thus, the industrial-processing exemption to which plaintiff is entitled. The trial court must review this formula or method in light of the statute and enter an order consistent with the reasonable formula or method. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals in part, reverse in part, and remand to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b286-4\">Young, C.J., and Viviano and Bernstein, JJ., concurred with MARKMAN, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b263-7\"> For the typical home, the 240-volt level is obtained across two 120-volt lines.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b264-6\"> There is no dispute that plaintiff may claim the industrial-processing exemption from the use tax for tangible personal property that is used or consumed in industrial processing <em>within </em>its generation plants.

The Court of Appeals erred in this regard because before the enactment of MCL 205.94o, the industrial-processing statute, see former MCL 205.94(g), as amended by 1998 PA 491, did not include an apportionment provision.

Furthermore, when property is used exclusively for exempt activity without any use for nonexempt activity, it is unnecessary to address MCL 205.94o(2) because the taxpayer is entitled to claim the industrial-processing exemption on 100% of the property used for industrial-processing activity, although application of the apportionment formula of MCL 205.94o(2) would nonetheless compel the same result.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b281-6\"> We do not express an opinion regarding whether elements of the electric system are also being used for other exempt \u201cindustrial processing\u201d activities under MCL 205.94o(3).

To the extent this is the dissent\u2019s view, we respectfully disagree. The language \u201cfirst comets] to rest in finished goods inventory storage\u201d clearly contemplates that exempt \u201cindustrial processing\u201d activity may occur within or without the factory. Moreover, we are not the first court to conclude that industrial processing and delivery are not mutually exclusive. See, e.g., <em>Mich Allied Dairy Ass\u2019n, </em>302 Mich at 649-650 (holding the fact that milk bottles and cans were used for delivery to the consumer did not render them nonexempt given that the bottles and cans were also used for industrial processing).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b286-5\">KELLY, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AK7r\">(dissenting). I respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s conclusion that plaintiff, Detroit Edison Company (DTE), engages in industrial processing after electric power leaves its plants. While DTE engages in industrial processing when, at the plant, it takes in raw materials and transforms those raw materials into electric power,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> industrial processing ends once the electric power leaves the plant. Electric power generated at the power plant is distributed through the electric grid. \"While its voltage is adjusted as it travels through the electric grid, the \u201cthing\u201d produced\u2014 electric power\u2014is not. Like ordinary industrial goods <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>that are packaged for efficiency, DTE transmits the same electric power on high voltage wires to reach customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">As a result, I would hold that because the electric power does not change after it leaves DTE\u2019s production facility, it is a finished good at that time. Because DTE\u2019s shipping and distribution of electricity does not constitute industrial processing, it is not entitled to the industrial-processing exemption for equipment located outside its production facilities. For these reasons I would not address the issue of apportionment, as it is not necessary in this case. Instead, I would reverse the Court of Appeals, vacate the judgment of the Court of Claims, and remand this case to the Court of Claims for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">I. LEGAL ANALYSIS AND APPLICATION</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">The Michigan Use Tax Act, MCL 205.91 <em>et seq., </em>imposes a tax on every person \u201cfor the privilege of using, storing, or consuming tangible personal property in this state at a rate equal to 6% of the price of the property.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> MCL 205.94o(l)(a) provides the general rule that the use tax \u201cdoes not apply to property sold to\u201d \u201c[a]n industrial processor for use or consumption in industrial processing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">MCL 205.94o both defines \u201cindustrial processing\u201d and provides specific examples of what activities are included and excluded from that definition. Subsection (7)(a) defines \u201cindustrial processing\u201d as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-8\">the activity of converting or conditioning tangible personal property by changing the form, composition, quality, combination, or character of the property for ultimate sale at retail or for use in the manufacturing of a product <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>to be ultimately sold at retail or affixed to and made a structural part of real estate located in another state. Industrial processing begins when tangible personal property begins movement from raw materials storage to begin industrial processing and ends when finished goods first come to rest in finished goods inventory storage.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">Subsection (6)(b) specifies, in relevant part, that industrial processing does <em>not </em>include [s]ales, distribution, warehousing, shipping, or advertising activities.\u201d Subsection (3)(d) in turn provides that industrial processing includes, among other activities, \u201c [inspection, quality control, or testing to determine whether particular units of materials or processes conform to specified parameters at any time before materials or products first come to rest in finished goods inventory storage.\u201d This Court has clarified that \u201cto determine whether the industrial processing exemption applies [in a particular case], it is necessary to consider the activity in which the equipment is engaged and not the character of the equipment-owner\u2019s business.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">Producing and transmitting electricity requires an integrated, interrelated, and interconnected system that includes generation plants, substations, transmission lines, distribution systems, transformers, and meters spread over a large geographic area, known as the electric system. Typically, electricity is first produced by converting raw materials such as coal, oil, or natural gas into heat. That heat then boils water to form steam, which turns a turbine shaft connected to a generator.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201c[A] generator is a magnet spinning inside <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>a coil of wire,\u201d inducing an electric current in the coil.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Defendant, the Department of Treasury (the Department), concedes, and I agree, that this process constitutes industrial processing.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">The Department, however, maintains that DTE\u2019s subsequent activity\u2014transmitting and distributing electricity\u2014is not \u201cindustrial processing\u201d under the plain language of MCL 205.94o. Rather, industrial processing ends when transmitting and distributing begin, whether the consumer good is electricity or any other product. In contrast, DTE claims that the exemption applies to property used up to the point when finished goods arrive at inventory storage, which, it argues, occurs when the electricity enters into a customer\u2019s meter. To determine which interpretation controls, this Court must determine the Legislature\u2019s intended scope of the industrial-processing exemption as applied to the production of electricity.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">A. DEFINITION OF INDUSTRIAL PROCESSING</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">The Legislature presumably had the basics of industrial processing in mind when crafting the industrial-processing exemption. Raw materials are brought into a production facility and then used to create a good by \u201c \u2018a process of manufacturing, development, [and] preparation for the market.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The newly produced good must then be transported to a retailer or customer. Typically, a definite and distinct point in time delineates when the manufacturer ceases production of a good and begins distribution. Once distribution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>begins, the manufacturer cannot claim the industrial-processing exemption for property that it uses in that activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">While electric power does not seem to fit neatly within this description of manufacturing, DTE creates electricity using raw materials, and this newly created electricity leaves the power plant destined for end users. While electricity cannot be packed into a shipping container and delivered on a truck or train, as many consumer goods can be, the General Sales Tax Act<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> nevertheless recognizes electricity as tangible personal property.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">DTE argues that industrial processing is clearly defined in the statute and is not complete until its good, electricity, is in its final form, usable by and ready for sale to the customer.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> It claims that equipment located outside the generation plant converts, conditions, and changes the character of the electricity and that this process is necessary before the electricity is ready for customers. DTE claims that the character of electricity is constantly changing during this phase.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">Contrary to DTE\u2019s claims, power that has left DTE\u2019s plants does not change in \u201cform, composition, quality, combination, or character . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals erred when it overemphasized DTE\u2019s claim that the electricity is not in its final, safe form until it reaches customers. DTE creates a consumable good, electricity, and as with any good, DTE requires a means to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>distribute and transport this good to its customers. While the electricity\u2019s voltage happens to be reduced during the distribution process for purposes of efficiency, the fundamental nature of the electric power never changes. On this point, the expert testimony proffered by the Department is instructive: \u201cThrough the use of transformers stepping up and stepping down the voltage, the composition and character of the electricity is not changed.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> While transformers assist in distributing, transmitting, and delivering electricity to DTE\u2019s customers, they do not alter the nature, composition, or character of electric power initially generated at a power plant. Producing electricity at a high voltage rate allows DTE to supply its product more efficiently across further distances, thus allowing it to create a larger customer base. The purpose of what DTE claims as industrial processing is, therefore, simply a means of distributing its product\u2014electric power\u2014most efficiently, not a means of producing a different product.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Indeed, as \u201c[t]angible personal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>property used or consumed for the <em>preservation or maintenance </em>of a finished good,\u201d the equipment DTE uses to preserve and maintain the flow of energy is explicitly excluded from the definition of industrial processing.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">Electric power is a good capable of sale, but it must be transmitted to customers like any other good. The fundamental nature of electricity\u2014the flow of electrons\u2014is not fundamentally altered after leaving the production facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">B. SPECIFIC EXCLUSIONS FROM \u201cINDUSTRIAL PROCESSING\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">This conclusion finds further support in MCL 205.94o(6)(b), under which the Legislature specifically excluded certain activities, including \u201c[s]ales, distribution, warehousing, shipping, or advertising activities,\u201d from the industrial-processing exemption. Additionally, as noted earlier in this opinion, MCL 205.94o(5)(i) excludes \u201c[t]angible personal property used or consumed for the preservation or maintenance of a finished good.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">The Department maintains that industrial processing does not include the activity of conveying a product to a customer through shipping or distribution.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>deed, even if an activity would otherwise qualify as \u201cindustrial processing\u201d under the statutory definition of that term, when an enumerated exclusion applies, the activity is not considered industrial processing for purposes of the exemption.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> This is consistent with the rule of statutory construction that, when a general statutory definition conflicts with a specific modifier of that definition, the specific modifier trumps the general definition.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\">Because distribution and shipping are not defined in the statute, each term must be given its plain meaning.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> \u201cShipping\u201d is defined as \u201c[t]he act or business of transporting goods.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> \u201cDistribution\u201d is a derivation of the verb \u201cdistribute,\u201d which means \u201c[t]o divide and dispense in portions; parcel out.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Therefore, relevant to this case, shipping and distribution refer to the transmission of goods from an industrial processor to the consumer.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">Because both distribution and shipping are excluded from the definition of industrial processing, activity occurring after the production of a good is not part of the industrial processing of that good. I agree with the Department that electricity is a vendible good when it leaves the production facility because it is capable of sale at that point. Therefore, the equipment used by DTE to convey that vendible good from its plants to its customers does not qualify for the industrial-processing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>exemption. Once the electricity leaves its plants, DTE delivers its product. The power lines and equipment outside its plants are simply the means by which DTE delivers the electric power that has been generated at its plants.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">C. SPECIFIC INCLUSIONS IN \u201cINDUSTRIAL PROCESSING\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">Nevertheless, DTE argues that it is engaged in activities that are specifically included in the statutory definition of industrial processing: inspection, quality control, and testing. While the Court of Appeals and the majority in this Court have accepted this argument, I do not.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">MCL 205.94o(3)(d) specifically includes within the industrial-processing exemption equipment used for \u201c[i]nspection, quality control, or testing to determine whether particular units of materials or products or processes conform to specified parameters at any time before materials or products first come to rest in finished goods inventory storage.\u201d Neither DTE nor the Court of Appeals has accounted for the fact that the electricity is a vendible good <em>as soon as it leaves </em>the production facility. To be included within the definition of \u201cindustrial processing\u201d for purposes of the exemption, MCL 205.94o(3)(d) requires that the \u201c[inspection, quality control, or testing\u201d occur <em>\u201cbefore materials or products first come to rest in finished goods inventory </em>storage.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The presence or absence of a physical storage location is not dispositive of whether an activity meets the requirement of MCL 205.94o(3)(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-9\">The majority sidesteps the fact that electricity <em>never </em>comes to \u201crest.\u201d Indeed, DTE\u2019s own expert stated that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>the inspection, quality control, and testing occur after the electricity leaves the plant simply because it promotes the efficient distribution of DTE\u2019s product: \u201cIt is not practical under the laws of physics ... for generation plants to produce electricity at the 120/240 volt level as it would require a wire that is 46 [times] greater in circumference than what is available.\u201d The changes to the voltage, therefore, make it efficient to distribute electricity; they do not affect the <em>production </em>of electricity or the quantum of power generated that leaves the power plant. It is that amount that is quantified to determine the power plant\u2019s output and must be considered the fixed goods inventory storage as contemplated in MCL 205.94o.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">The majority denies that electricity comes to rest in a finished goods inventory storage at any point. I disagree. The phrase \u201cfinished goods inventory storage\u201d must be interpreted in the context of how electricity is actually produced and distributed. While electric power <em>never </em>\u201ccomes to rest\u201d at all, the statute does not require goods to be stored in a physical or fixed location before being considered ready for distribution. Rather, the goods must reach a point at which shipping and distribution are appropriate. Consider, hypothetically, a widget that is produced on a conveyor belt that empties into a waiting delivery truck, which then leaves the facility the moment the widget is placed in the truck. Under this circumstance, industrial processing ceases when the widget is placed on the truck, even though it never comes to rest in a physical storage location before distribution. It is logical to reach the same conclusion here, given that the Legislature defined \u201ctangible personal property\u201d to include electricity. It is appropriate to judge DTE\u2019s activities by demarcating the line separating the production of electricity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>from <em>distribution </em>to consumers.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">Because DTE only engages in shipping and distributing electricity once the electricity leaves its production facilities, it does not use any property in industrial processing outside its production facilities under the industrial-processing exemption. Therefore, all equipment used in transmitting and distributing electric power outside its generating plants is subject to the use tax.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">II. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">The majority characterizes changes in the voltage of electricity as industrial processing. I disagree. Changes in voltage merely affect the form in which electric power is distributed. DTE only transmits electricity at high voltages to provide for its efficient distribution. DTE is free to choose the most appropriate manner in which to send its product to customers. But that choice does not qualify it for the industrial-processing exemption with regard to the property used in carrying out that choice.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-9\">As the Department concedes, DTE engages in industrial processing inside its power plants when it uses industrial machinery to produce electricity. It is therefore entitled to the industrial-processing exemption from the use tax on property used during that process. However, once the electricity leaves DTE\u2019s power <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>plants, the electricity is, and must be, consumed by the end users to whom it is distributed. Personal property used during this distribution process is therefore beyond the scope of the industrial-processing exemption and is subject to the use tax. I would thus hold that DTE may not claim any use-tax exemption for personal property used to distribute and transport electricity from its plants to customers. Therefore, I respectfully dissent and instead would reverse the Court of Appeals\u2019 judgment that DTE is entitled to an industrial-processing exemption for equipment located outside its production facilities, vacate the judgment of the Court of Claims, and remand this case to the Court of Claims for further proceedings.</p>\n<judges id=\"b297-4\">ZAHRA. and MCCORMACK, JJ., concurred with KELLY, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b286-6\"> Electric power generated at a plant is measured in wattage.
