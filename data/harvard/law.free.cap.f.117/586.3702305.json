The legislature authorized it to compromise such indebtedness, and for that purpose to levy taxes and issue new bonds, and a part of it had been so compromised. Plaintiff, who was the owner of a number of judgments on the old bonds and also of one rendered on some of the new issue, entered into two written agreements with the county on the same day, by the first of which it was provided that, in consideration of similar agreements by the other creditors, plaintiff\u2019s judgments on the old bonds should be compromised for 20 per cent, and costs, to be paid by the county by a day named. The second agreement recited that it was made in consideration of the first, and provided that on the same date the county should pay the remaining judgment in full. <em>Held., </em>that such agreements were parts of the same contract, to be construed together, and that the acceptance by plaintiff of payment of the second judgment after the date fixed by the contract, with knowledge that such payment was made from taxes levied and collected to carry out the compromise agreement, and which, under the constitution of the state, could be used for no other purpose, was a waiver of the right to insist that time was of the essence of the contract, and bound him to carry out the compromise agreement as to the other judgments.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b622-8\">2.

At an election held thereunder in Muhlenberg county it was voted to subscribe $400,000 to the stock of such a railroad company, and issue its bonds for that sum, with interest at 7 per cent. The subscription was made, and the bonds were issued bearing interest coupons. For five years thereafter the interest was paid by the county, but in 1873 the county defaulted, and repudiated its bonds upon the ostensible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>ground, among others, that the county court had not ordered the election as provided by the statute; the real ground probably being the heavy burden of the debt, which was out of all proportion to the property of the county. Many suits were brought and judgments obtained by the holders of the bonds, but, in consequence of the resistance of the people of the county, and the shifts and devices of its officials, when any were elected, by resignation or concealment of themselves, or otherwise, the judgments could not be collected, either by execution or mandamus. Another act was passed by the legislature in 1878, authorizing the county to compromise and pay or fund its bonds by the issue of new bonds for the amount for which the old bonds should be compromised, and to levy taxes to pay the old bonds at the amount agreed upon, or the new bonds, as the case might be. Most of the bonds were thereupon compromised at 20 cents on the dollar, and new bonds issued, when the proceeding was suspended by an injunction of a state court in a suit brought by taxpayers. This injunction was finally dissolved upon an appeal to the supreme court of the state. But in the meantime the holders of both the old and new bonds had been unable to collect them. Under the provisions of the refunding act just mentioned, the county compromised most of the old bonds, and its officials constituted the Fidelity Trust &amp; Safety Vault Company of Louisville the financial agent of the county for the purpose of converting the new bonds into funds for paying the sums required to take up the old bonds or exchanging the new for the old bonds in such proportion as should be agreed, and this purpose had been in part accomplished. The petitioner had obtained, several years before, a judgment in the United States circuit court for the district of Kentucky for the sum of $11,987 upon some of the old bonds, and he and one Gillett had also obtained another judgment in the same court for the sum of $17,169 upon some of the new bonds which had been issued to take up some of the old; neither of which judgments had the plaintiffs in those cases been able to collect. They had also acquired other judgments on old bonds by assignment. In this state of things, the county and Dyer and Gillett, on the 20th day of March, 1900, entered into a compromise agreement, consisting of two parts, both executed on the same day. The parts of this agreement were as follows. One was:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ARL\">\u201cThis contract, made and entered into this 20th day of March, 1900, by and between Azro Dyer and S. P.

P.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b625-15\">This tender was refused upon the ground that the agreement of March 20, 1900, had been forfeited by the failure to pay on or before January 1, 1901, and was no longer in force. Then, having made a demand for the levy of a tax to pay his judgment in full (which was refused), Dyer filed in the court below his petition for a mandamus to compel the levy. That court having denied his petition, a bill of exceptions was settled, and the case brought here on a writ of error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b626-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>Azro Dyer, for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b626-4\">W.

It is strenuously contended by the plaintiff in error, and the point is emphasized in his brief in reply, that they are separate and distinct agreements, relating, the one, to the judgment recovered by himself on the old bonds, and the other, to the joint judgment of Dyer and Gillett on the new. And he says: \u201cThe promise of the county embodied in agreement No. 1 was supported by a good consideration. The promise in agreement No. 2 had no valid consideration to. support it. The circumstances that the two agreements were made at the same time does not cure the defect.\u201d By which last proposition .it is doubtless meant to say that the fact of their being contemporaneous does not necessarily import that they are dependent parts of one contract; and this, as a general statement of a rule of construction, may be admitted. But, to say nothing of the circumstances that the stipulations of these two agreements relate to a general purpose of effecting a compromise, they are interrelated by their express terms, and it is stated that the one is the consideration of the other. There cannot be the slightest doubt that the two agreements should be read as one. Although the other bondholders did not join in the particular agreement between the county and Dyer and Gillett, it sufficiently appears that it was a condition to the scheme of refunding or paying off the old bonds at 20 per cent, that all, or substantially all, the old bonds should be compromised, and that this was practically accomplished when the agreement here in question was made. Each of the numerous bondholders, therefore, had an interest in the assets which were to become available under the new effort of the county to disencumber itself. The old bonds amounted to about one-fourth of the whole taxable value of property in the county, and it was manifest that, if the tax levies were to be consumed by paying off the old bonds at par and interest, there could be nothing left for those coming into the new scheme, The agreement here in question recites that \u201cthe said county and the holders of said bonds and judgments wish to compromise the same, and have mutually agreed on the terms of compromise; and whereas, the said Dyer and Gillett now own the following judgments on the said original bonds: Now, therefore, in consideration of the premises, and of the agreement of certain other owners of said bonds or judgments thereon to accept a like sum from said county in compromise of their respective debts, the said Dyer and Gillett have agreed, and do hereby agree, to accept in compromise,\u201d etc. The other creditors have a clear and strong equity to the fulfillment of the contract, and their agreement in reference to their own bonds was a sufficient consideration to support the agreement of Dyer and Gillett in the present instance. So far as the agreement relates to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>payment of the judgment on the new bonds, it has been accomplished, and we have only to inquire, upon the point we are how considering, whether there was a sufficient consideration for the agreement in reference to the judgment on the old bonds. We think it clear that there was. In a letter of the county commissioners to Dyer, mentioned in the preceding statement, this contract is called an \u201coption,\u201d and in the brief of the plaintiff in error it is claimed to be such. But chat is a misnomer. It was a complete mutual engagement, and bound both the parties to its stipulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-4\">But it is contended that time was of the essence of the contract, and that by its failure to pay the amount stipulated on or before January i, 1901, the county forfeited its right thereunder, and that the other parties were remitted to their original right. Whether, in the circumstances of this case, and especially having regard to the facts that time was not in terms made essential, and that the contract affected, and was affected by, the rights of the other creditors, it may be doubtful whether the court would be justified in applying the rule relied upon by the plaintiff in error. In the case cited\u2014 Clarke v. White, 12 Pet. 191, 9 B. Ed. 1046\u2014the reason given for the rule is that, until the agreement is executed, it continues unilateral, and is not obligatory upon the creditor. Says the court: \u201cIt is generally true, in cases of composition, that the debtor who agrees to pay a less sum in discharge of a contract must pay punctually; for until performance the creditor is not bound.\u201d And undoubtedly this is so where the agreement is a mere privilege to the debtor, and is not one pervaded by the substantial elements of a mutual contract. But we need not pursue this subject in view of the conclusion we reach upon another point. It is undoubted that a party who has the right to strict performance of a contract in respect \u201cto the time thereof may waive it, and does so if he subsequently accepts the benefits of the contract. It is shown\u2014indeed, is admitted\u2014that subsequently to January 1st the petitioner received from the county two payments of $1,000 each upon the judgment rendered in favor of himself and Gillett out of moneys levied for. that express purpose, and that on May 16, T901, he received the balance of the judgment out of the proceeds of bonds sold for the purpose of enabling the county to pay this judgment. We can have no doubt that he knew from what source those moneys came, and that they had been raised for the purpose of meeting the obligations of the county assumed by the contract he had with it; and the agents of the county held the funds he received charged with that definite purpose, which he knew they could not rightfully disregard. His suggestion is that he was entitled to be paid his judgment on the new bonds any way, and that his reception of the payment was no more than his right. But the county had the right to have these funds applied to the fulfillment of its contract of March 20, 1900. His claim that he had repudiated the continuing obligation of the contract, and was, therefore, acting independently of it, cannot be sustained. If one\u2019s acts and speech do not conform with each other, the things done must have their due legal consequence, notwithstanding all protestations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>to the contrary (Dodsworth v. Iron Works, 13 C. C. A. 552, 66 Fed. 483), and Dyer\u2019s intention must be held to be what his acts import. '</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">The petitioner further contends that \u201cthe acceptance of payment by Dyer and Gillett of their partnership judgment did not operate as any waiver by Dyer of his individual rights in respect to the present judgment\u201d; but we think it did. The evidence tends to show that, although Dyer was the nominal plaintiff in the case, the judgment really belonged to Dyer and Gillett, and the contract itself, to which Dyer was a party, so states.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">Again, it is urged that the accepting of payment of the new judgment was not effectual as a waiver, because it was not supported by a valuable consideration. What we have already said disposes of this contention. The county, although it owed the judgment, had the right to determine the application of the funds. It had, as he knew, determined that they should be applied upon the contract, and not as a payment of the judgment independently considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">Lastly, it is contended that the tender was insufficient. The reasons given are that it was made to Dyer and Gillett, whereas the judgment was in favor of Dyer alone, and \u201cbecause it was not an absolute tender, but the money was offered on condition that it should be accepted in full of principal, interest, and costs.\u201d The first of these reasons is answered by what we have said upon another point. The tender was rightly made to the parties whom the contract recognized \u2022as the owners of the judgment. As to the second, no such objection was made at the time of the tender. It was refused upon the ground that the contract was no longer in existence. This technical objection, now made, appears to be an afterthought. The objection, not being taken, at the time, was waived. Besides, the contract expressly stipulated that upon payment of the money Dyer and Gillett should release the county from all liability upon the judgments, and should acquit it of all liability upon \u201call of said indebtedness.\u201d It is not contended that the amount tendered was insufficient, or that there was any doubt as to what it was intended to cover. The judgment on the new bonds was already paid. It would seem, therefore, that the statement that the tender was made in full of principal, interest, and \u2022cost to that date was justified by the express stipulation of the parties. Certainly, such statement was not larger than a demand for the release and acquittance stipulated for, and in Hepburn v. Auld, 1 Cranch, 321, 2 L. Ed. 122, it was held that in such case the tender was not insufficient because it was accompanied by such a requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">We think the circuit court did not err in refusing the writ, and its order is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
