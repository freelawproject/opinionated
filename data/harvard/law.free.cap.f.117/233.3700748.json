Antonio Salvo, the plaintiff below, was, at and for some time prior to the injury complained of, a laborer in the employ of defendants, and boss of a night shift of such laborers, engaged in the excavation of a tunnel, near the opening of which other shifts of defendants\u2019 employ\u00e9s were excavating a cut; all such excavations being in rock, which had to be loosened by blasting. The defendants boarded and lodged the laborers working with plaintiff in tents, which they had provided and placed so near to this work of excavation that the tents were in danger from falling rocks whenever a large blast was exploded in the cut; and as the men' slept in these tents during the hours when their shifts were not at work, it had been the custom for the men in charge of such blasting to cause the men sleeping in these tents to be awakened and warned of the danger, that they might seek places of safety before the explosion of such large blasts. On July 10, 1900, about 3 o\u2019clock in the afternoon, and while the plaintiff and other men of his night shift were asleep in one of these tents, a blast in the work of excavating the cut, wherein about 35 pounds of giant powder and 8 kegs of black powder had been placed in a hole 18 or 20 feet deep, was exploded, and thereby pieces of rock were thrown upon and through the said tent, striking the plaintiff, and breaking an arm and a leg. There was contradictory testimony as to whether, before the explosion of such blast, warning had been given to the plaintiff or to the other laborers then occupying, the same tent.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b270-5\">W.

To permit the application of the fellow-servant doctrine, the injured servant must at the time of the injury not only be serving the sam\u00e9 master, but be engaged in the same employment with the negligent servant who caused the injury. Wood, Mast. &amp; Serv. \u00a7 435. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>answer admits that defendants furnished the tent for boarding their employ\u00e9s, and for their lodging, and that it was the custom and rule of defendants to have one of their employ\u00e9s warn every one in the vicinity of a blast of the fact that it was about to be discharged, and that plaintiff was at the time of this blast in the tent, resting between his intervals of labor. The evidence shows without contradiction that plaintiff was boss of a night shift, and was not engaged in work, but resting and sleeping in the tent from 6 o\u2019clock in the morning till 7 o\u2019clock in the evening every day, and that the blast which caused his injury was discharged about 3 o\u2019clock in the afternoon, during his time for rest and sleep. Plaintiff occupied the tent, not as a boarder or tenant, but as a servant of the defendants, and his board and lodging was received in part compensation for his services. Wood, Mast. &amp; Serv. \u00a7 155. But while engaged at his meals or wrapped in slumber he was performing no services for the master, and being in the performance of no employment, but obtaining and enjoying compensation from the master, he was not during such time the fellow servant of any of the employ\u00e9s who were at work, about which he was in no way engaged or assisting. He was not in the condition of a servant who is being conveyed in a car to his work, but was as much separated from it as if he had been sleeping in his own home a mile away. The master, who had furnished him this lodging, located at a place made dangerous by the discharging of blasts in conducting the master\u2019s business, owed him the duty of giving him timely warning, to enable him to avoid the danger. The verdict determined the fact that this duty was not performed, and that plaintiff\u2019s injuries resulted from this failure. There were no errors in the rulings or charge of the court which are prejudicial to the defendants, and the' judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"\u00b6\" orphan=\"true\">\n<p id=\"b269-16\"> 3.
