Each note was indorsed as follows: \u201cPay to the order of P. G. Browning, demand and notice waived, G. W. Franklin;\u201d and the last mentioned note was further indorsed: \u201cCredited by cash on the within October 5, 1895, $65.\u201d Nonpayment, excepting the $65, was alleged, and judgment prayed for the amount due. Defendant answered, admitting his indebtedness to plaintiff April 27, 1895, and that in satisfaction thereof he then indorsed and transferred to him said two notes, but denied that he \u201cguarantied absolutely\u201d the payment of the notes, \u201cexcept as appears indorsed thereon,\u201d and denied any indebtedness to plaintiff; alleging that Skinner, the maker of the notes, was a resident of the Indian Territory, and solvent; that the notes were given \u201cfor wintering about two hundred head of N. S. cattle, of which said brand there were about two thousand head, worth about $50,000; that said cattle were at that time in the Cherokee Nation, and said notes were intended to, and did, secure to the defendant a lien on all of said N. S. cattle for the payment of the debt therein expressed; that said notes were Indorsed by defendant to plaintiff with the understanding and agreement that plaintiff would protect and enforce said lien, and collect the amount of said notes when due out of said cattle, and subject them to the payment of said debt; that when said notes became due and payable, said cattle had not been removed from the Cherokee Nation; but plaintiff, in utter disregard of the defendant\u2019s right, and in violation of his said agreement and of the defendant\u2019s urgent request to enforce said lien, wholly refused and neglected so to do, although the same was admitted by said Skinner to be just and due, but trifled with said security, and negligently permitted said Skinner to ship said cattle out of the country, and suffered said lien to be lost, and since which time said Skinner has become wholly insolvent.\u201d The plaintiff demurred to this answer, as not stating facts sufficient to constitute defense to the complaint, or to entitle defendant to any relief. The court sustained the demurrer, and the defendant refusing to plead further, judgment was rendered in favor of the plaintiff, which, upon appeal, was affirmed by the United States court of appeals for the Indian Territory.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b263-5\">John B.

G. Browning, demand and notice waived, G. W. Franklin,\u201d is admitted by the answer. These indorsements are contracts in writing, made in the transfer of the notes for value. The obligation assumed by the indorser by such indorsement is as certain and free from doubt or ambiguity as if fully set forth in express words, i Dan. Neg. Inst. \u00a7 717. As the indorsement waives demand and notice, the agreement of the indorser is that he will pay the notes to the indorsee or holder if they are not paid by the maker at maturity. The defense pleaded seeks to change and make different this obligation of defendant under his written indorsement by alleging a contemporaneous \u201cunderstanding' and agreement,\u201d to the effect that the defendant should not be liable upon his indorsements unless plaintiff had diligently protected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>an alleged lien upon cattle, and neglected no means of collecting the notes through such lien. The words \u201cunderstanding and agreement\u201d import an oral agreement, and it is not stated to have been in writing. But the contract of indorsement, like every other written contract, must be held to contain all the terms of the final agreement between the parties relative to the obligation of the indorser. \u201cIt is a firmly settled principle that parol evidence of an oral agreement, alleged to have been made at the time of the drawing, making, or indorsing of a bill or note, cannot be permitted to vary, qualify, or contradict, or add to, or subtract from, the absolute terms of the written contract. 2 Pars. Bills &amp; N. 501; Specht v. Howard, 16 Wall. 564, 21 L. Ed. 348;\u201d Forsythe v. Kimball, 91 U. S. 291, 23 L. Ed. 352. Merely as holder of the notes so indorsed, no duty was cast upon the plaintiff to look after or follow the cattle, even if the terms of the notes gave a lien upon any cattle. No cattle were delivered to or put in the care or charge of plaintiff. After the notes became due and remained unpaid, the defendant was absolutely liable for their payment. He could not require the holder to pursue the maker or any security. His right was to pay the notes to the holder, and assume the control and collection of them himself. Ross v. Jones, 22 Wall. 576, 22 L. Ed. 730, and cases cited. But the language of the notes is ineffectual to give any lien upon any cattle. No cattle are described so as to be fairly capable of identification. The answer states that the cattle wintered by defendant were about 200, and that Skinner had about 2,000 of the same brand, and claims that the lien covered them all, and was not confined to those wintered by defendant, and which alone are mentioned in the note. It is needless to consider this claim. The note gives no authority to take possession of or sell any cattle. It appears to be an agreement that Skinner will regard those cattle as the property from the sale of which he will pay the notes, and will make such payment from the first shipment; which implies that he is to continue to have full dominion over the cattle, and unrestrained power to dispose of the same. It is a promise to pay the notes out of the proceeds of the sale of the cattle. This creates no lien. Cook v. Black, 54 Iowa, 693, 7 N. W. 121.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"\u00b6\" orphan=\"true\">\n<p id=\"b262-24\"> 4. See Bills and Notes, vol. 7, Cent.
