The defendant admitted that he signed both notes. Fine testified that he indorsed the notes and that the plaintiff, to whom he delivered them, paid him for them shortly after their dates and before their maturities. The plaintiff testified that he paid value for the notes. Both notes were in evidence. This evidence was not contradicted. Each note was in writing for a definite amount and was an unconditional promise to pay to the order of the payee a definite amount of money at a specified time in the future. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 107, \u00a7\u00a7 47, 49, 53, 54, 75, 80, 83.
