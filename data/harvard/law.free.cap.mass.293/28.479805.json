Rioux, a boy six and one half years old, lived with his mother in a house, on the easterly side of Main Street in Monson, hired by his grandfather from the defendant. To the eastward of the house, beyond a grass plot about seventy-five feet wide, was the defendant\u2019s power house, also about seventy-five feet wide. About thirty feet to the east of the power house was the defendant\u2019s garage. The house, the power house and the garage were all on the northerly side <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>of a driveway which ran easterly from Main Street over land owned by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">On April 17, 1930, the boy was fatally injured in the garage by being caught between a door and a brick pier. There was evidence of negligence, but not of wilful, wanton or reckless conduct, on the part of a servant of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">The limits of the premises hired by the grandfather were not exactly defined, but there was no evidence that they included the doorway of the garage. Although the boy\u2019s aunt, who was a member of the family, was permitted to store an automobile in the garage, there was no evidence that she was more than a licensee. Neither was there any evidence that the boy was in the garage for any purpose connected with his aunt\u2019s automobile. Even though the defendant never objected to the presence of the boy on its premises, he was no more than a licensee entitled only to freedom from wilful, wanton, and reckless injury. The entry of a verdict for the defendant under leave reserved was right.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
