There was evidence tending to show that the ushers were supplied with flashlights by the defendant, and were supposed to use them for the purpose of lighting the path for patrons going to their seats while the performance was being presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-3\">At the close of the evidence the plaintiff made twelve requests for rulings. Those numbered 1, 2, 4, 6, 9 and 12 were given by the trial judge, who found for the defendant. The third request was: \u201cIf the theatre and the aisle down which the plaintiff followed the usher for a seat, were then darker than was reasonably necessary for a proper showing of the picture, the defendant violated its duty to the plaintiff to keep its theatre in a reasonably safe condition.\u201d As to this request the judge stated: \u201cFacts, not so found. And I now add, theatre not darker than was reasonably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>necessary for proper showing.\u201d The fifth request was: \u201cIf the court shall find that at the time of the performance in question the defendant had employees there who were employed to light the aisles for patrons going to seats, such employment warrants a finding that failure so to light the aisle in question would be a breach of the defendant\u2019s duty to exercise reasonable care to safeguard the plaintiff from injury.\u201d As to this request the judge stated: \u201cI do not find such failure on the part of the employee as to warrant a finding of negligence of the defendant.\u201d The plaintiff\u2019s seventh request was: \u201cEven if at the time of the accident the defendant was not absolutely required to furnish additional light, yet if it did so through its agents and did it negligently, the defendant is guilty of negligence in this action.\u201d As to this request the judge stated: \u201cI do not find negligence on the part of the defendant. I now add thereto 'because the facts shown in the evidence do not seem to me to indicate negligence on the part of the employee.'\u201d The plaintiff\u2019s eighth request was: \u201cIf at the time of the accident the usher or employee of the defendant lit the path of the plaintiff with a flashlight, throwing a light in her path that was brighter than what it otherwise would have been, and then suddenly, while she was walking down steps, extinguished or turned the light away, leaving a darkened path, such conduct would constitute negligence on the part of the defendant\u2019s agent.\u201d This request was properly denied. It does not include all the facts which might have been found on the evidence, including the testimony of the usher who testified that when he started to seat the boy he turned the light some, but that he thought there was light enough for both persons; that just as he turned the light away the plaintiff fell. The plaintiff\u2019s tenth request, that \u201cThe defendant has not sustained such burden,\u201d was rightly denied. The \u201cburden\u201d here evidently refers to the ninth request, which recites that \u201cThe burden is on the defendant to show lack of due care on the plaintiff's part which contributed to her injury.\u201d The burden of proof of establishing negligence of the defendant was upon the plaintiff. <em>Castano </em>v. <em>Leone, </em>278 Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>429, 431. The eleventh request, that \u201cOn all the evidence the plaintiff is entitled to recover, because it appears thereby that the defendant was negligent and that the plaintiff was in the exercise of due care,\u201d was rightly denied. Whether the plaintiff was in the exercise of due care and the defendant was negligent presented questions of' fact to be determined by the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">The trial judge found as a fact that the defendant was not negligent. Such a finding will not be set aside if it can be supported on any \u201creasonable view of the evidence with all rational inferences of which it is susceptible.\u201d <em>Ashapa </em>v. <em>Reed, </em>280 Mass. 514, 516. This finding upon the evidence presented was not erroneous as matter of law. <em>Moss </em>v. <em>Old Colony Trust Co. </em>246 Mass. 139, 143. <em>Holton </em>v. <em>Denaro, </em>278 Mass. 261, 262. <em>Castano </em>v. <em>Leone, </em>278 Mass. 429. The burden of proving negligence of the defendant rested on the plaintiff. As was said by this court in <em>Winchester </em>v. <em>Missin, </em>278 Mass. 427, at page 428: \u201cThe trial judge might have discredited all the testimony tending to support the plaintiff\u2019s contention.\u201d The order of the Appellate Division fails to show any prejudicial error.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">\n<em>Order of Appellate Division dismissing report affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
