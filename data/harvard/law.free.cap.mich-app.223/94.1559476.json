Plaintiff appeals from an order of the Worker\u2019s Compensation Appellate Commission that, in relevant part, modified the magistrate\u2019s open award of benefits by denying benefits effective July 31, 1990. We reverse the decision of the WCAC and reinstate the magistrate\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-3\">At issue in this case are the reasonable employment provisions of the Worker\u2019s Disability Compensation Act (wdca), MCL 418.101 <em>et seq.-, </em>MSA 17.237(101) <em>et seq., </em>which represent a partial codification of the judicially created favored-work doctrine. <em>Pulver v Dundee Cement Co, </em>445 Mich 68, 74; 515 NW2d 728 (1994). We thus begin by quoting the relevant statutory language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-4\">(5) If disability is established pursuant to subsection (4), entitlement to weekly wage loss benefits shall be determined pursuant to this section and as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-5\">(a) If an employee receives a bona fide offer of reasonable employment from the previous employer, another employer, or through the Michigan employment security commission and the employee refuses that employment without good and reasonable cause, the employee shall be considered to have voluntarily removed himself or herself from the work force and is no longer entitled to any wage loss benefits under this act during the period of such refusal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-6\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-7\">(9) \u201cReasonable employment\u201d, as used in this section, means work that is within the employee\u2019s capacity to perform that poses no clear and proximate threat to that employee\u2019s health and safety, <em>and that is within a reasonable distance from that employee\u2019s residence. </em>[MCL 418.301(5)(a) and (9); MSA 17.237(301)(5)(a) and (9) (emphasis supplied).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b110-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>The facts relevant to this case are as follows. In 1970, plaintiff began working for defendant as a nurses\u2019 assistant. In June 1988, plaintiff injured her left elbow at work when she struck it on a metal cart. Plaintiff was sent home from work. She began receiving treatment from various doctors. Defendant began voluntarily paying worker\u2019s compensation benefits to plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">In December 1989, defendant instructed plaintiff to report for work. On her first day back, plaintiff, while working a two-handed job, reinjured her elbow when she struck it on a trash can while attempting to lay a sheet on an examining table. Plaintiff was again sent home from work.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">In April 1990, plaintiff moved to Ohio and got married to an Ohio resident. Following the wedding, plaintiff informed defendant\u2019s personnel department that she intended to live in Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">In July 1990, defendant sent plaintiff a written job offer of one-handed work. At this time, plaintiff was residing in Ohio approximately 142 miles from defendant\u2019s hospital. Plaintiff did not respond to the letter. Defendant discontinued paying benefits to plaintiff. Plaintiff petitioned for wage-loss benefits. Following a hearing, the magistrate found that plaintiff had suffered a work-related injury in June 1988, and, as a result, had become partially disabled. The magistrate found that plaintiff had suffered a second work-related injury in December 1989 that aggravated her existing partial disability. The magistrate concluded that plaintiff continued to be partially disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">Concerning defendant\u2019s July employment offer, the magistrate found as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>All the doctors agree that plaintiff could do a one-handed job. I so find. Defendant offered plaintiff a one-handed [sic] in July of 1990. However, in April of 1990 plaintiff moved her domicile to Lima, Ohio and was living there with her new husband in July of 1990. The offered job was approximately 142 miles from plaintiff\u2019s new residence. Under Section 301(9) \u201creasonable employment\u201d is employment \u201cwithin a reasonable distance from that employee\u2019s residence.\u201d I find that the job offered in July of 1990 by defendant was not a reasonable offer of work due to the inordinate distance between plaintiff\u2019s residence and the offered work.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b111-3\">The magistrate found that plaintiff was entitled to an open award of wage-loss benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\">Defendant appealed the magistrate\u2019s decision to the WCAC, raising numerous grounds. The WCAC affirmed the magistrate\u2019s decision in all respects except with respect to defendant\u2019s contention that plaintiff did not make a good-faith attempt at performing its July 1990 offer of employment. Concerning this argument, the WCAC stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-5\">The portion of the statute at issue defines \u201creasonable employment\u201d as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-6\">\u201cMCL 418.301(9) [MSA 17.237(301)(9)]. \u2018Reasonable employment,\u2019 as used in this section, means work that is within the employee\u2019s capacity to perform that poses no clear and proximate threat to that employee\u2019s health and safety, and that is within a reasonable distance from that employee\u2019s residence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-7\">In construing whether injured employees have justifiably refused offers of favored work when the employee has moved, courts have asked whether there is good and reasonable cause for the employee\u2019s refusal of favored work. A factor in that analysis is the distance between the location of work and either an employee\u2019s residence at the time of injury <em>or </em>at the time of the offer. We highlight the following cases discussing this section of the statute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>Most recent is the Supreme Court opinion in <em>[Pulver, supra]. </em>In that case, one month after the injured plaintiff moved to Florida, defendant offered her favored employment. She was not yet reemployed, nor being rehabilitated. However, she testified to keeping in touch with the employer for more than a year after her injury to see if there was favored work available. One month after selling \u201call\u201d her possessions, leasing a condominium in Florida and \u201cattempting to seek work\u201d there, defendant\u2019s offer was made.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-6\">The Supreme Court remanded the case stating the determination of whether the refusal of reasonable employment is for good and reasonable cause is a question of fact. The Court listed examples of factors to consider as:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-7\">\u201c(1) the timing of the offer, (2) if the employee has moved, the reasons for moving, (3) the diligence of the employee in trying to return to work, (4) whether the employee has actually returned to work with some other employer and, (5) whether the effort, risk, sacrifice or expense is such that a reasonable person would not accept the offer.\u201d <em>Id., </em>13.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-8\">Under the facts of this case, the magistrate only examined the fact that plaintiff has moved away and not any other consideration. Pursuant to <em>Pulver, </em>this analysis is insufficient.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-9\">In what had been the seminal case in Michigan for years on this issue, <em>Bower v Whitehall Leather Co, </em>412 Mich 172 [312 NW2d 640] (1981), the injured plaintiff moved to Florida with his wife after his injury. Both found employment there. Plaintiff rejected defendant\u2019s offer of favored work. The Court stated the purpose of the worker\u2019s compensation act is to \u201cencourage [the worker] to rehabilitate himself.. .. It is in the interest of the employer, the employee, and the public to have the employee return to gainful employment as soon as possible.\u201d <em>DeTroyer v Ernst Kern Co, </em>282 Mich 689, 694 [277 NW 199] (1937). The Court praised plaintiffs actions stating that such \u201cinitiative and industriousness, should be encouraged. To deny benefits in the instant circumstances not only would punish this employee for finding and holding substitute work, but also would severely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>undercut the rehabilitative and mitigative purposes of the act.\u201d <em>[Bower, supra], </em>192.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-3\">In <em>Bower, </em>the Supreme Court cited <em>Morrison v Merrick\u2019s Super Market, Inc, </em>300 Minn 535 [220 NW2d 344] (1974), where an employee refused favored work made while he was engaged in a retraining program. His refusal was justified because his actions comported with the remedial nature of the act and with \u201cthe more specific statutory purpose of \u2018encouraging injured workers to increase their employability through retraining\u2019.\u201d <em>[Bower, supra] </em>195-196.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-4\">Further, the Court stated:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-5\">\u201cIt should be recognized that we do not hold that just any personal consideration may excuse a refusal of favored work. Nor may an employee avoid returning to work tendered upon a good-faith offer by merely removing himself from the locality of the employer. <em>Only under circumstances similar to those in the instant case, where the claimant\u2019s actions further the policies of the statute, can such a rejection be justified.\u201d Id., </em>196. (Emphasis ours.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-6\">We interpret this case to mean that so long as an employee\u2019s activities in the new location further the act\u2019s purposes of rehabilitation or reemployment, the employee is justified in refusing the offer of favored work.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-7\">The sequence of events in this case are plaintiff\u2019s June 1989 injury, her August 1989 engagement, her December 1989 reinjury, her April 1990 marriage and relocation and defendant\u2019s July 1990 offer to return her to favored employment. Her refusal to return was based on the distance of 140 miles and on personal reasons. She was living with her husband in Lima, Ohio in a three-room apartment. She remained unemployed and was collecting welfare benefits. She testified she had not earned any income since she had left Michigan but was collecting food stamps. While her husband had been employed at the time of their wedding, at the time of trial he was laid off and was a student. Plaintiff testified at hearing:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-8\">\u201cI live in Ohio. I\u2019m a resident of Ohio. I have no intentions of, you know, coming back here unless my husband wants to come back and he\u2019s made it very clear, he\u2019s laid off and we live there.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>We observe in the record of this case no indication whether plaintiff even looked for work in the Lima, Ohio area.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-6\">The magistrate did not address these facts in his conclusion that plaintiff was justified in refusing defendant\u2019s offer of favored work. As stated above, his only consideration appears to be the distance between Hutzel Hospital and plaintiffs husband\u2019s apartment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-7\">As the previously cited case law demonstrates, an offer of favored work at the site where a plaintiff was injured is always a \u201creasonable distance from that employee\u2019s residence\u201d under MCL 418.301(9) [MSA 17.237(301)(9)] regardless of whether plaintiff has moved. Once an employee moves away, the proper analysis must be made under [MCL 418.301(5)(a); MSA 17.237(301)(5)(a)]. There must be good and reasonable cause for refusal in accord with the statutory purposes of the Workers\u2019 Disability Compensation Act. <em>Pulver, [supra]; Bower, supra.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-8\">Because the magistrate\u2019s analysis under <em>Pulver </em>was incomplete, we exercise our limited fact finding power recognized in <em>Holden v Ford Motor Co, </em>439 Mich 257 [484 NW2d 227] (1992) and conclude plaintiff\u2019s refusal was unreasonable under the broad range of factors recited in <em>Pulver </em>and when contrasted to the statutory purposes cited in <em>Bower. </em>Plaintiff was neither employed nor being rehabilitated. The offer came only three months after plaintiff voluntarily terminated her physical therapy and left Michigan; there is no evidence of plaintiff seeking or obtaining any employment in Ohio; the favored work offered involved observing a monitor and was within plaintiff\u2019s medical restrictions and thus involved no risk preventing her from accomplishing her tasks; and finally as shown <em>supra, </em>she was seen in Michigan visiting family which at the least demonstrated an ability to return. Based on the record before us, we find plaintiff\u2019s refusal of the favored work without good and reasonable cause and deny benefits as of the date plaintiff was to begin work, July 31, 1990.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b114-9\">Plaintiff appeals this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-10\">Our review of worker\u2019s compensation cases is limited. We are concerned only with whether the wcac <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>applied the correct legal test and whether there is any competent evidence to support its factual findings. <em>Pulver, supra </em>at 82; <em>Darling v Inter City Trucking (On Remand), </em>221 Mich App 521, 523-524; 561 NW2d 865 (1997). In cases involving reasonable employment under \u00a7 301(5) (a) of the WDCA, the correct legal test is whether a bona fide offer of reasonable employment was made by the employer and whether the employee refused such employment without good and reasonable cause. <em>Pulver, supra </em>at 82. The questions whether an offer of reasonable employment was made and whether such offer was refused without good and reasonable cause are themselves questions of fact. <em>Pulver, supra </em>at 77.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-3\">Even if the WCAC fails to develop its analysis, there is no error if the WCAC applies the correct legal test. <em>Id. </em>at 82. Moreover, the specific facts of a particular case may be pertinent to both the determination of the reasonableness of the employer\u2019s offer and the determination of the reasonableness . of the employee\u2019s refusal. <em>Derr v Murphy Motors Freight Lines, </em>452 Mich 375, 384-386; 550 NW2d 759 (1996) (Mallett, J., with Cavanagh and Levin, JJ., concurring). Thus, in <em>Derr, </em>Justice Mallett stated in a plurality opinion that the wcac does not necessarily err in discussing such facts in the context of the employee\u2019s refusal rather than first considering them in the context of the employer\u2019s offer. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\">In this case, the wcac\u2019s opinion indicates that it was generally aware that the correct legal test consists of the questions whether the employer made an offer of reasonable employment and whether the employee unreasonably refused such offer. Moreover, its finding that plaintiff refused defendant\u2019s job offer without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>good and reasonable cause appears to be supported by some competent evidence. However, plaintiff takes issue with the following portions of the wcac\u2019s opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-5\">In construing whether injured employees have justifiably refused offers of favored work when the employee has moved, courts have asked whether there is good and reasonable cause for the employee\u2019s refusal of favored work. A factor in that analysis is the distance between the location of work and either an employee\u2019s residence at the time of injury <em>or </em>at the time of the offer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-6\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-7\">As the previously cited case law demonstrates, an offer of favored work at the site where a plaintiff was injured is always a \u201creasonable distance from that employee\u2019s residence\u201d under MCL 418.301(9) [MSA 17.237(301)(9)] regardless of whether plaintiff has moved. Once an employee moves away, the proper analysis must be made under Section 301(5)(a). There must be good and reasonable cause for refusal in accord with the statutory purposes of the Workers\u2019 Disability Compensation Act. <em>Pulver, [supra] Bower, supra.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b116-8\">Plaintiff contends that the wcac erroneously construed \u00a7 301(9) as providing that an employment offer at the site where the employee was injured is always a reasonable distance from the employee\u2019s residence regardless of whether the employee has .moved. Relying on <em>Bingham v American Screw Products Co, </em>398 Mich 546, 552; 248 NW2d 537 (1976), a case that construed the \u201csuitable work\u201d provisions of the Michigan Employment Security Act (mesa), MCL 421.1 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 17.501 <em>et seq., </em>plaintiff contends that \u00a7 301(5)(a) and \u00a7 301(9) of the WDCA, properly construed together, provide that an offer of work is not an offer of \u201crea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>sonable employment\u201d if the offered work is not within a reasonable distance from the employee\u2019s residence <em>at the time of the offer. </em>Plaintiff also contends that the WCAC opinion erroneously indicates that the reasonableness of the distance from an employment offer to the employee\u2019s residence can be measured as of either the time of the injury or the time of the job offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-3\">A decision of the WCAC is subject to reversal if the WCAC operated within the wrong legal framework or its decision was based on erroneous legal reasoning. <em>Darling, supra. </em>Moreover, error may be committed by basing a finding of fact on a misconception of law or by failing to correctly apply the law. <em>Price v Westland, </em>451 Mich 329, 336-337; 547 NW2d 24 (1996). Statutory interpretation is a question of law, <em>Golf Concepts v Rochester Hills, </em>217 Mich App 21, 26; 550 NW2d 803 (1996). Generally, this Court will defer to the construction placed upon statutory provisions by a particular department of government. <em>Bachman v Dep\u2019t of Treasury, </em>215 Mich App 174, 182; 544 NW2d 733 (1996). However, this principle does not control where the agency interpretation is clearly wrong. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\">Because we find persuasive plaintiff\u2019s reliance on the <em>Bingham </em>Court\u2019s analysis of the suitable work provisions of the mesa, we begin our analysis by considering <em>Bingham. </em>At the time <em>Bingham </em>was decided, \u00a7 29(l)(e) of the MESA, MCL 421.29(l)(e); MSA 17.531(l)(e), provided that an individual was disqualified from receiving benefits under the MESA \u201cin all cases in which he . . . (e) Has failed without good cause to accept suitable work when offered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>him . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> See <em>Bingham, supra </em>at 563. At the time <em>Bingham </em>was decided, \u00a7 29(6) of the mesa, MCL 421.29(6); MSA 17.531(6), defined suitable work as follows: \u201cIn determining whether or not any work is suitable for an individual, the commission shall consider . . . the distance of the available work from his residence.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> See <em>Bingham, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">In <em>Bingham, </em>the plaintiff employee left his employment in Michigan with the defendant employer because he was unable to find adequate housing for his wife and children, and returned to Kentucky. The defendant subsequently sent a notice to the plaintiff to report to work at his regular job. <em>Id. </em>at 553. The plaintiff refused the defendant\u2019s Michigan job offer because of its distance from his Kentucky home. <em>Id. </em>The Michigan Employment Security Commission (mesc) found that the plaintiff was not disqualified from receiving benefits under the mesa because the plaintiff had good cause for refusing the defendant\u2019s job offer. <em>Id. </em>An mesc referee and the MESC Appeal Board affirmed this finding. <em>Id. </em>at 554. The circuit court reversed the appeal board decision, in part and as relevant to this case, on the ground that the defendant\u2019s Michigan offer of employment while the plaintiff was living in Kentucky was \u201csuitable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This Court affirmed the circuit court\u2019s determination, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>57 Mich App 21; 225 NW2d 199 (1974), holding, as characterized by the Supreme Court, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-3\">as a matter of law the act required Bingham [the plaintiff] be available for work both at the locality in which he resided at the time the offer of work was made (Kentucky) and at the locality at which he resided during the period he earned his base period credit weeks (Michigan). [398 Mich 554-555.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b119-4\">Our Supreme Court reversed the decision of this Court and reinstated the administrative determination of the mesc. <em>Id. </em>at 571. The Court stated that the issue whether the defendant\u2019s offer of reemployment was an offer of \u201csuitable work\u201d turned on the statutory meaning of the word \u201cresidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 563. The Court stated that because the word \u201cresidence\u201d is not defined in the mesa, it must be given its plain and ordinary meaning and noted that the ordinary meaning of \u201cresidence\u201d has been defined as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-5\">\u201cResidence means the place were one resides; an abode; a dwelling or habitation; especially, a settled or permanent home or domicile. Residence is made up of fact and intention. There must be the fact of abode and the intention of remaining.\u201d <em>[Id. </em>at 564, quoting <em>Wright v Genesee Circuit Judge, </em>117 Mich 244, 245; 75 NW 465 (1898).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">The Court also noted other definitions suggesting that a residence is one place and not several places. <em>Bingham, supra </em>at 564, citing <em>In re Scheyer\u2019s Estate, </em>336 Mich 645, 651-652; 59 NW2d 33 (1953). The Court thus held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-7\">Applying this definition to the facts of this case, it is clear that Bingham\u2019s \u201cresidence,\u201d his \u201csettled or permanent home,\u201d where he \u201cintends to remain,\u201d is Pineville, Kentucky. Therefore, under \u00a7 29(l)(e) read in conjunction with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>\u00a7 29(6), Bingham was not disqualified for refusing American Screw Works\u2019 reemployment offer because his refusal was with \u201cgood cause\u201d; the offer was not an offer of \u201csuitable work\u201d because the locality of the reemployment offer (Farmington, Michigan) was clearly an unreasonable distance from his Pineville, Kentucky residence. We hold that the claimant was not disqualified. [Bingham, <em>supra </em>at 564-565.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">The Court found clearly erroneous this Court\u2019s holding that \u201cresidence\u201d meant both the locality in which the claimant resided at the time of the job offer and the localities in which the claimant resided during the period he earned the base period credit weeks. <em>Id. </em>at 565. As relevant to this case, the Court stated that to interpret residence as meaning that a person may reside in two or more places would essentially amend \u00a7 29(6) \u201cto reach a result contrary to that mandated by the plain language fixed by the Legislature.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court also noted that \u00a7 29(6) focuses on the \u201clocality of residence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">Like <em>Bingham, </em>we construe the definition of \u201creasonable employment\u201d contained in \u00a7 301(9) as focusing on the locality of the employee\u2019s residence at the time an offer of employment is made. However, the word \u201cresidence\u201d is undefined in \u00a7 301(9). Thus, we hold that its ordinary meaning, as defined in <em>Bingham, </em>applies. Accordingly, the plain language of \u00a7 301(5) (a) and \u00a7 301(9), read in conjunction, indicates that an offer of employment is not an offer of \u201creasonable employment\u201d unless the employment \u201cis within a reasonable distance from that employee\u2019s residence,\u201d i.e., the one place the employee actually and permanently intends to reside, at the time the offer is made.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>In this case, the wcac interpreted \u00a7 301(5) (a) and \u00a7 301(9) of the wdca as providing that if an offer of employment originates from the site where the plaintiff was injured then such offer is, as a matter of law, always a reasonable distance from the employee\u2019s residence regardless of whether the employee has moved. The wcac then held that the proper analysis in cases where the employee has moved is simply whether the employee has good and reasonable cause for refusing the offer. However, the WCAC\u2019s interpretation is contrary to the plain language of subsections 5(a) and 9 of \u00a7 301 and effectively amends these subsections to reach a result not intended by the Legislature. As indicated above, when distance is a factor in determining whether a job offer constitutes \u201creasonable employment,\u201d the plain language of subsections 5(a) and 9 focuses on the locality of the employee\u2019s residence at the time the employment offer is made. The issue of distance is a question of fact. <em>Pulver, supra </em>at 77. The statute does not provide that, in certain instances, \u201creasonable distance\u201d is established as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-3\">As authority for its interpretation, the WCAC relied on <em>Pulver </em>and <em>Bower </em>as engrafting such a judicial gloss to the statutory language of \u00a7 301(5) (a) and \u00a7 301(9). We disagree with the wcac\u2019s assessment of these cases. First, the <em>Bower </em>Court was not faced with the statutory language contained in \u00a7 301(9) because it was decided in the context of the common-law favored-work doctrine. Under the common law, favored work was typically defined with respect to the employee\u2019s physical ability to do the favored work. See, e.g., <em>Michales v Morton Salt Co, </em>450 Mich 479, 487; 538 NW2d 11 (1995) (\u201cFavored work entails <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>the modification of an employee\u2019s duties that in some manner accommodates the employee\u2019s injury.\u201d); <em>Bower, supra </em>at 182 (Favored work . . . can be loosely defined as less strenuous post-injury work.\u201d). In <em>Bower, </em>there was no question but that the defendant employer offered the plaintiff employee work within the plaintiff\u2019s physical limitations, i.e., favored work. <em>Bower, supra </em>at 180-181, 190-191. Thus, we see no anomaly in the <em>Bower </em>Court\u2019s consideration of the circumstances of' the employee\u2019s move as factors affecting the issue whether the employee reasonably refused the undisputed offer of favored work. Moreover, the <em>Bower </em>Court specifically noted that its decision was consistent with <em>Bingham. Bower, supra </em>at 196, n 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">In <em>Pulver, supra </em>at 70, n 2, the Court did not consider the issue whether the job offer met the statutory definition of reasonable employment because that issue was not properly preserved by the plaintiff. However, the <em>Pulver </em>Court specifically noted that the lower tribunals should have focused on the statutory requirements of reasonable employment, but that it would ignore the error for the purposes of its opinion. <em>Id. </em>at 73, n 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">Accordingly, neither <em>Bower </em>nor <em>Pulver </em>stands for the construction of \u00a7 301(5) (a) and \u00a7 301(9) advocated by the WCAC (that an employment offer at the site of the employee\u2019s injury is always a reasonable distance from the employee\u2019s residence regardless of whether the employee has moved and that the proper analysis in cases where the employee has moved is simply whether the employee unreasonably refused the offer) because these cases did not consider the statutory requirements of reasonable employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>We acknowledge that under current law an employee\u2019s move to a new location is relevant to determining both the question whether an employment offer constituted reasonable employment, \u00a7 301(9) of the WDCA, as well as the question whether the employee unreasonably refused an offer of reasonable employment, <em>Pulver, supra </em>at 81. Moreover, a bad-faith attempt to avoid accepting a bona fide offer of reasonable employment by moving never constitutes good and reasonable cause. <em>Id. </em>at 79, 81, n 12; <em>Bower, supra </em>at 196.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-3\">However, in this case, the wcac did not simply consider the fact of plaintiff\u2019s move as a relevant fact in its determination whether plaintiff unreasonably refused defendant\u2019s employment offer. Rather, the wcac committed an error of law in construing \u00a7 301(5)(a) and \u00a7 301(9) as providing that an offer of employment at the site where the employee was injured is always a reasonable distance from that employee\u2019s residence regardless of whether the employee has moved. As explained above, this holding is contrary to the plain statutory language and no authority for such construction can be found in either <em>Pulver </em>or <em>Bower. </em>The wcac\u2019s legal error permitted it to find, as a matter of law, that defendant\u2019s offer was for \u201creasonable employment.\u201d However, whether an offer is for \u201creasonable employment\u201d is a question of fact. The wcac then committed further legal error in construing \u00a7 301(5) (a) and \u00a7 301(9) as providing that when an employee moves, the proper analysis is only whether the employee has reasonable cause for refusing an employment offer. Again, this holding is contrary to the plain statutory language and no authority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>for such construction can be found in either <em>Pulver </em>or <em>Bower.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">Accordingly, we conclude that the wcac\u2019s erroneous statutory construction caused it both to apply improperly the proper legal framework and to apply incorrectly the law to its findings of fact. We therefore reverse the opinion and order of the wcac and reinstate the magistrate\u2019 decision. In light of this holding, we need not address plaintiff\u2019s remaining issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">Reversed.

As long as the wcac applies the correct legal standard and there is any competent evidence to support its findings, the courts are not to disturb the wcac\u2019s findings. <em>Pulver v Dundee Cement Co, </em>445 Mich 68, 82-83; 515 NW2d 728 (1994); <em>York v Wayne Co Sheriff's Dep\u2019t, 219 </em>Mich App 370; 556 NW2d 882 (1996). Here, the issue is whether plaintiff refused \u201ca bona fide offer of reasonable employment,\u201d as defined by MCL 418.301(9); MSA 17.237(301)(9), for \u201cgood and reasonable cause\u201d under MCL 418.301(5)(a); MSA 17.237(301) (5) (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-9\">The <em>Pulver </em>Court held that the question whether a refusal of reasonable employment is for good and reasonable cause is one of fact, not law. <em>Id. </em>at 81, 83. It held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-10\">We do not attempt to divine what \u201cgood and reasonable cause\u201d is. What is reasonable in one situation may not be in another. Therefore no exhaustive definition could ever be formed to encompass the varied nuances of such a deceptively simple legal principle as \u201cgood and reasonable cause.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>The case at bar does, however, provide examples of some of the factors that may be considered in gauging the reasonableness of an employee\u2019s actions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-3\">These factors may include: (1) the timing of the offer, (2) if the employee has moved, the reasons for moving, (3) the diligence of the employee in trying to return to work, (4) whether the employee has actually returned to work with some other employer and, (5) whether the effort, risk, sacrifice or expense is such that a reasonable person would not accept the offer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-4\">We provide these factors merely as examples. Not every personal consideration will constitute good and reasonable cause entitling an employee to continued benefits after a refusal of an offer of reasonable employment. It is left to the sound discretion of the factfinder to carefully examine the facts and circumstances of each case to determine what is good and reasonable cause in any given situation. <em>[Id. </em>at 81-82.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">The <em>Pulver </em>Court reinstated the decision of the WCAB (the predecessor of the wcac), concluding that competent evidence supported the wcab\u2019s finding that the plaintiff had \u201cgood and reasonable cause\u201d for refusing the defendant\u2019s offer in the context of her move to Florida. <em>Id. </em>at 82-83. It specifically noted that the plaintiff repeatedly called the defendant over a one-year period inquiring into the availability of work and that when she was unable to find suitable work she moved to Florida in a good-faith effort to improve her health, be closer to her family, and find suitable work. <em>Id. </em>She signed a one-year lease and paid a security deposit, evidencing her intent to live there permanently. <em>Id. </em>at 83. On the basis of these facts, the wcab found that plaintiff did not move to avoid the job offer in Michigan. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\"><em>Bower v Whitehall Leather Co, </em>412 Mich 172; 312 NW2d 640 (1981), also involved an injured employee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>who moved out of state. The plaintiff and his wife obtained employment in Florida. The Court noted the purposes of the Worker\u2019s Disability Compensation Act: to compensate the employee while incapacitated and to encourage him to rehabilitate himself and r\u00e9tum to gainful employment. <em>Id. </em>at 191. It rejected an absolute rule requiring employees to accept favored work that they are physically capable of performing without consideration of various nonphysical factors. <em>Id. </em>at 194. It found that the plaintiff refused the defendant\u2019s offer of work for \u201cgood and reasonable cause.\u201d It held at 196:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-5\">It should be recognized that we do not hold that just any personal consideration may excuse a refusal of favored work. Nor may an employee avoid returning to work tendered upon a good-faith offer by merely removing himself from the locality of the employer. Only under circumstances similar to those in the instant case, where the claimant\u2019s actions further the policies of the statute, can such a rejection be justified.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">In the instant case, the WCAC found that the magistrate erred in finding that plaintiff refused an offer of reasonable work for \u201cgood and reasonable cause\u201d under \u00a7 301(5)(a). The WCAC found that the magistrate\u2019s analysis was inadequate because he considered only the distance between defendant\u2019s place of business and plaintiff\u2019s new residence in Ohio. <em>Pulver </em>and <em>Bower </em>indicate that when a party moves far from the defendant\u2019s place of business, additional inquiry into the circumstances of the move and efforts to obtain employment in the new location are necessary to the analysis of the question of the party\u2019s continued eligibility for benefits. <em>Pulver </em>at 81-82; <em>Bower </em>at 196. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>Accordingly, I believe that the WCAC correctly concluded that the magistrate\u2019s analysis was inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-3\">As with the magistrate, plaintiff argues that the distance between the work offered by defendant and her new residence is dispositive of her claim. She relies on <em>Bingham v American Screw Products, </em>398 Mich 546, 563-364; 248 NW2d 537 (1976), a case under the Michigan Employment Security Act, for the proposition that her \u201cresidence\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 301(9) was Ohio rather than Michigan. The <em>Bower </em>Court indicated that its decision was consistent with <em>Bingham. Bower </em>at 196, n 16. Plaintiff seems to argue that the unreasonable distance of the offer from her new residence precluded the offer from being \u201creasonable employment\u201d under \u00a7 301(9) and that no further analysis need be made under \u00a7 301(5)(a). However, in <em>Bingham </em>itself, the Court did not end its analysis with whether the offer was reasonable in light of the distance but also considered the distance in the context of the ultimate issue whether the plaintiff had good cause to refuse the offer. <em>Bingham </em>at 571. Moreover, as noted above, <em>Pulver </em>and <em>Bower </em>clearly indicate the necessity of considering the circumstances of the move and the party\u2019s efforts to obtain employment in the new location in analyzing the question of the party\u2019s continued eligibility for benefits upon a move.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">In its opinion here, the WCAC next stated: \u201cAs the previously cited case law demonstrates, an offer of favored work at the site where a plaintiff was injured is always a \u2018reasonable distance from that employee\u2019s residence\u2019 under MCL 418.301(9) [MSA 17.237(301)(9)] regardless of whether plaintiff has moved.\u201d The cited case law does not, in my judgment, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>demonstrate this proposition. However, contrary to the majority opinion\u2019s contention, the WCAC did not construe both \u00a7 301(5)(a) and \u00a7 301(9) as providing that, as a matter of law, an offer at the site where the plaintiff was injured is always a reasonable distance from the employee\u2019s residence, regardless of whether the plaintiff has moved. Rather, it only so construed \u00a7 301(9). In short, the wcac assumed that there was an offer of \u201creasonable employment\u201d under \u00a7 301(9) without considering the distance of the offer from plaintiffs new residence. However, it then proceeded to analyze properly the present case under \u00a7 301(5) by considering the factors set forth in <em>Pulver </em>and <em>Bower </em>to determine if plaintiff had \u201cgood and reasonable cause\u201d to refuse the offer. As the majority opinion notes, in a plurality opinion in <em>Derr v Murphy Motors Freight Lines, </em>452 Mich 375, 384-386; 550 NW2d 759 (1996), the Michigan Supreme Court stated that the wcac does not necessarily err in considering the proper facts in the context of discussing the employee\u2019s <em>refusal </em>rather than in the context of the employer\u2019s <em>offer.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">In its opinion here, the WCAC held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-6\">The sequence of events in this case are plaintiffs June 1989 iryuiy, her August 1989 engagement, her December 1989 injury, her April 1990 marriage and relocation and defendant\u2019s July 1990 offer to return her to favored employment. Her refusal to return was based on the distance of 140 miles and on personal reasons. She was living with her husband in Lima, Ohio in a three-room apartment. She remained unemployed and was collecting welfare benefits. She testified she had not earned any income since she had left Michigan, but was collecting food stamps. While her husband had been employed at the time of the wedding, at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>the time of trial he was laid off and was a student. Plaintiff testified at hearing:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-3\">\u201cI live in Ohio. I have no intention of, you know, coming back here unless my husband wants to come back and he\u2019s made it very clear, he\u2019s laid off and we live there.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-4\">We observe in the record of this case no indication whether plaintiff even looked for work in the Lima, Ohio area.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-5\">. . . Once an employee moves away, the proper analysis must be made under \u00a7 301(5)(a). There must be good and reasonable cause for refusal in accord with the statutory purposes of the Worker\u2019s Disability Compensation Act. <em>Pulver [supra] Bower, supra.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-6\">Because the magistrate\u2019s analysis under <em>Pulver </em>was incomplete, we exercise our limited fact finding powers recognized in <em>Holden v Ford Motor Co, </em>439 Mich 257 (1992) and conclude plaintiff\u2019s refusal was unreasonable under the range of factors recited in <em>Pulver </em>and when contrasted to the statutory purposes cited in <em>Bower. </em>Plaintiff was neither employed nor being rehabilitated. The offer came only three months after plaintiff voluntarily terminated her physical therapy and left Michigan; there is no evidence of plaintiff seeking or obtaining any employment in Ohio; the favored work offered involved observing a monitor and was within plaintiff\u2019s medical restrictions and thus involved no risk preventing her from accomplishing her tasks; and finally as shown <em>supra, </em>she was seen in Michigan visiting family which at the least demonstrated an ability to return. Based on the record before us, we find plaintiff\u2019s refusal of favored work without good and reasonable cause and deny benefits as of the date plaintiff was to begin work, July 31, 1990.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">On the basis of that portion of the wcac\u2019s opinion, I believe that, despite its misstatement of the law regarding \u00a7 301(9), the WCAC ultimately applied the correct legal standard in analyzing plaintiffs claim. It considered the factors outlined in <em>Pulver </em>and <em>Bower </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>to determine whether plaintiff refused an offer of \u201creasonable employment\u201d for \u201cgood and reasonable cause.\u201d Further, their factual findings are supported by more than competent evidence. Therefore, I would affirm the wcac\u2019s opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
