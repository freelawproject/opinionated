Before: Gribbs, P.J., and Mackenzie and Griffin, JJ.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b480-8\">Griffin, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AxT\">Defendant was convicted by a jury of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of liquor, MCL 257.625; MSA 9.2325, and attempting to resist and obstruct a police officer, MCL 750.479; MSA 28.747, MCL 750.92; MSA 28.287. He pleaded guilty of being a third-time OUIL offender and was sentenced to concurrent terms of two to five years\u2019 imprisonment for the OUIL 3rd conviction and six months to one year for the attempted resisting and obstructing conviction. Defendant appeals as of right both convictions. We affirm. In doing so, we hold that, under the totality of the circumstances of this case, the police did not violate defendant\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights by briefly restraining him with a pain compliance device in order to execute a warrant for a blood sample.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-9\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b480-10\">After the police stopped defendant for speeding, he stumbled out of his vehicle, stood unsteadily, and with slurred speech admitted that he had been drinking. Thereafter, defendant failed a field sobriety test, refused to take a Breathalyzer examination, and vomited in his jail cell. While arresting officers Bradley LaCross and Michael Troyer drove defendant to a hospital to execute a warrant to draw a sample of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>defendant\u2019s blood, defendant proclaimed repeatedly in a loud, angry voice that he would not permit anyone to draw his blood.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">Defendant became \u201cvery uncooperative\u201d at the hospital and refused to lie on the examination table. Defendant jerked his arm away from the laboratory technician who attempted to draw his blood. Concerned about the safety threat posed by defendant\u2019s evasive conduct, the two officers restrained defendant by laying him on the examination table and applying for \u201ca few seconds\u201d \u201cDo-Rite sticks\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to pressure points on defendant\u2019s wrists. The pressure subdued defendant, who then relaxed and permitted the laboratory technician to draw his blood.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">Officer LaCross described Do-Rite sticks as being two plastic rods connected with a one-inch cord. The device is used by wrapping the cord around certain pressure points and exerting pressure by briefly pulling or twisting the handles.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> LaCross testified that the device inflicts a \u201cquick and simple\u201d discomfort that causes no injury or lasting pain. According to LaCross, all Sault Ste. Marie police officers receive training before receiving certification to carry and use Do-Rite sticks.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">After trial, defendant claimed that the use of Do-Rite sticks constitutes cruel and unusual punishment. The trial court rejected defendant\u2019s argument finding that, under the circumstances of this case, the police used Do-Rite sticks \u201cin a reasonable fashion[]\u201d to \u201csubdue\u201d defendant and execute the warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>n</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">Defendant claims that it is \u201ccruel and unusual for the police to have the ability to forcibly draw blood from an individual for a violation of the motor vehicle code.\u201d However, because defendant cites no authority to support this proposition, we consider the issue to be waived. <em>People v Piotrowski, </em>211 Mich App 527, 531; 536 NW2d 293 (1995). Furthermore, the Eighth Amendment is inapplicable because defendant was only a detainee at the time of the alleged misconduct. <em>Brewer v Perrin, </em>132 Mich App 520, 529, n 3; 349 NW2d 198 (1984), citing <em>Bell v Wolfish, </em>441 US 520, 535, n 16; 99 S Ct 1861; 60 L Ed 2d 447 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">Nevertheless, the dissent cites <em>Rochin v California, </em>342 US 165, 166; 72 S Ct 205; 96 L Ed 183 (1952), for the proposition that the use of Do-Rite sticks to subdue a combative detainee violates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. However, in <em>Graham v Connor, </em>490 US 386, 388, 392-393, 394; 109 S Ct 1865; 104 L Ed 2d 443 (1989), the United States Supreme Court specifically rejected the amorphous \u201csubstantive due process,\u201d or \u201cshock the conscience\u201d approach applied in <em>Rochin, supra, </em>and held that excessive force claims must be analyzed under the Fourth Amendment\u2019s \u201cobjective reasonableness\u201d standard. See also <em>Lester v Chicago, </em>830 F2d 706, 710-711 (CA 7, 1987). Thus, the issue is whether the search and seizure is unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment, as applied to the states through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment; not whether the search and seizure violates Due Process. See <em>Electro-Tech, Inc v H F Campbell Co, </em>433 Mich 57, 127-128; 445 NW2d 61 (1989) (Brickley, J., dissenting); <em>Lester, supra </em>at 710-711.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>In determining the reasonableness of a particular seizure, we must carefully balance \u201cthe nature and quality of the intrusion on the individual\u2019s Fourth Amendment interests against the countervailing governmental interests at stake.\u201d <em>Graham, supra </em>at 396 (internal quotations marks omitted); see <em>People v Holloway, </em>416 Mich 288, 299; 330 NW2d 405 (1982). In excessive force cases, we determine if the officers\u2019 actions are \u201cobjectively reasonable\u201d in light of the facts and circumstances confronting them, not with 20/20 hindsight. <em>Graham, supra </em>at 397; <em>Hammer v Gross, </em>932 F2d 842, 846 (CA 9, 1991). Because drawing blood is not, in itself, unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment, see <em>Schmerber v California, </em>384 US 757, 771; 86 S Ct 1826; 16 L Ed 2d 908 (1966); <em>People v Perlos, </em>436 Mich 305, 313; 462 NW2d 310 (1990), we must decide whether police officers may use Do-Rite sticks to subdue a suspect who is resisting a legal warrant to draw blood.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">No Michigan case directly addresses this issue. However, in <em>Holloway, supra, </em>our Supreme Court held that the police acted reasonably in pressing on the suspect\u2019s throat and pinching the pressure points on his jaw to gain access to and search his mouth for hidden evidence. See also <em>Wayne Co Prosecutor v Recorder\u2019s Court Judge, </em>149 Mich App 183, 187; 385 NW2d 652 (1986). Thus, it is not necessarily unreasonable for police to painfully manipulate pressure points as a means to search for dissolvable evidence. <em>Holloway, supra-, Recorder\u2019s Court Judge, supra. </em>Because pain compliance techniques are not necessarily illicit, <em>Holloway, supra, </em>the issue is not whether Do-Rite sticks are unconstitutional because they cause temporary pain. Rather, the issue is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>whether the kind or degree of pain caused by Do-Rite sticks is unreasonable under the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">In <em>Forrester v San Diego, 25 </em>F3d 804 (CA 9, 1994), cert den 513 US 1152; 115 S Ct 1104; 130 L Ed 2d 1070 (1995), the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals addressed the reasonableness of using a device similar to Do-Rite sticks. In a 2-1 decision, the majority upheld a jury finding that San Diego police officers did not use excessive force in using \u201cOrcutt Police Nonchakus\u201d (two wooden sticks each connected at one end by a cord) to disperse demonstrators who resisted arrest by going limp. Noting that the device seemed to cause less pain than other permissible compliance techniques, the <em>Forrester </em>majority held that police acted reasonably in twisting the device around the wrists of demonstrators whom they were trying to arrest or disperse. <em>Id. </em>at 807, 809. The dissent agreed that intentional infliction of pain by police is not unconstitutional per se. <em>Id. </em>at 814 (Kleinfeld, J., dissenting). However, the dissenting judge opined that, because the technique proved totally ineffective at moving the limp demonstrators, the continued use of the device was done to \u201cpunish\u201d nonviolent, passively resisting demonstrators \u201cfor refusing to get up and walk.\u201d <em>Forrester, swpra </em>at 811-813. Because it was used for no reason other than to punish, the dissenting judge deemed the continued use of the device to be unreasonable. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">m</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">In the present case, after evaluating the totality of the circumstances, we agree with the ruling of the trial court and hold that the police acted reasonably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>in briefly using Do-Rite sticks to subdue defendant and ensure the safe execution of the search warrant. First, the police clearly had a strong and legitimate interest in executing the warrant to draw defendant\u2019s blood as soon as possible. See <em>Perlos, supra </em>at 327-328. Further, the laboratory technician testified that he could not have safely drawn defendant\u2019s blood unless defendant ceased his combative conduct. Indeed, were he not pacified, defendant could have injured himself or others by causing the needle to inadvertently lacerate or break. With the obvious harm inherent by a misdirected or broken needle, the police were legitimately concerned about subduing defendant in order to facilitate the safe and effective execution of the warrant. Otherwise, defendant could, have caused injury and thwarted the execution of the warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">Second, the nature and quality of the intrusion on defendant\u2019s person was not severe, unnecessary, or unduly intrusive. Officer LaCross and the laboratory technician testified that defendant was so combative that handcuffs and bed restraints would not have effectively prevented him from moving during the drawing of his blood. Even if the two officers were large and strong enough to control the defendant without using Do-Rite sticks, it is doubtful whether the force exerted in physically overpowering, positioning, and holding the combative defendant would have been less violent or caused less pain than the quick application of the Do-Rite sticks. In addition, we question whether without extreme force or the potential for pain the two officers could have held defendant still enough to ensure a safe, effective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>blood test. On this issue, we agree with the Ninth Circuit majority in <em>Forester, supra </em>at 807-808 that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-4\">[p]olice officers ... are not required to use the least intrusive degree of force possible. Rather, as stated above, the inquiry is whether the force that was used to effect a particular seizure was reasonable, viewing the facts from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene. See Graham, 490 US at 396. . . . Whether officers hypothetically could have used less painful, less injurious, or more effective force in executing an arrest is simply not the issue. See <em>Hammer, </em>932 F2d 846.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">Defendant makes no claim that the sticks caused him severe pain or injury. On the contrary, the laboratory technician testified that defendant showed no signs of pain whatsoever. Furthermore, unlike the scene depicted by the dissenter in <em>Forrester, </em>the evidence in this case does not establish that the police used Do-Rite sticks simply to punish. Rather, Officer LaCross applied the sticks only for a few seconds to subdue and protect the safety of the combative defendant. Under these circumstances, we agree with the trial court that the Do-Rite sticks were reasonably applied and constituted a reasonable means of controlling defendant and executing the search warrant. Indeed, the pain caused by the brief application of Do-Rite sticks appears less severe than the choke hold and jaw poking our Supreme Court deemed reasonable in <em>Holloway. </em>If the use of Do-Rite sticks were held to be unreasonable simply because they briefly inflict pain, then not only is <em>Holloway </em>wrongly decided, but arm twisting, limb holds, and many other commonly used and essential compliance methods would be unconstitutional. We will not subscribe to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>such an oppressive and unnecessary restriction of law enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">There is no merit in defendant\u2019s remaining issues on appeal. Defendant claims that a new trial is required because there were no black jurors. However, defendant did not challenge the jury array below, and he cites no legal authority to support his argument on appeal. Therefore, defendant has abandoned this unpreserved issue. <em>People v Hubbard (After Remand), </em>217 Mich App 459, 465; 552 NW2d 493 (1996); <em>Piotrowski, supra </em>at 530. In any event, defendant has not shown that black citizens were purposely or systematically excluded from the jury. <em>Hubbard, supra </em>at 473.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">Defendant also argues that the trial court committed error requiring reversal in admitting testimony regarding defendant\u2019s performance on field sobriety tests. However, defendant again fails to cite authority in support of his argument. Thus, this issue is also abandoned. <em>Piotrowski, supra </em>at 530. Nevertheless, the evidence was relevant to establish defendant\u2019s drunkenness and lay witnesses are qualified to testify about the opinions they form as a result of direct physical observation. MRE 701; <em>Lamson v Martin (After Remand), </em>216 Mich App 452, 459; 549 NW2d 878 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">Next, defendant contends that the search warrant authorizing police to draw defendant\u2019s blood was not based on probable cause. We disagree. Defendant\u2019s preliminary breath test, which indicated a 0.169 blood alcohol level, in itself justifies a reasonable person\u2019s conclusion that defendant\u2019s blood could reveal an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>alcohol level exceeding the limit for lawful driving. See, generally, <em>People v Stumpf, </em>196 Mich App 218, 226-227; 492 NW2d 795 (1992); <em>People v Tracy, </em>186 Mich App 171, 174; 463 NW2d 457 (1990). This is especially true where defendant staggered out of his vehicle, admitted that he had been drinking, made several errors in reciting the alphabet, and vomited in his jail cell. <em>Stumpf, supra </em>at 226-227.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">Defendant also argues that the results of his blood test were inadmissible because his blood was not timely drawn. Again, we disagree. The reasonableness of any time lapse is consigned to the trial court\u2019s sound discretion. <em>People v Schwab, </em>173 Mich App 101, 104; 433 NW2d 824 (1988). We find no abuse of discretion. Particularly where an expert testified that the delay was reasonable, a seventy-minute delay, without more, does not render the blood evidence inadmissible. See <em>People v Jacobsen, </em>448 Mich 639, 641; 532 NW2d 838 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">Next, defendant claims that reversal is required because a police officer testified that he requested a \u201cpby\u201d (preliminary breath test) from defendant. However, the trial court ordered the testimony stricken, and the jurors did not leam of the test results. Contra <em>People v Keskinen, </em>177 Mich App 312, 319-320; 441 NW2d 79 (1989). Under these circumstances, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial on this basis. <em>People v Herbert, </em>444 Mich 466, 477; 511 NW2d 654 (1993); see <em>People v McAlister, </em>203 Mich App 495, 504; 513 NW2d 431 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">Defendant also argues that the prosecutor committed several instances of misconduct. We disagree. In any event, even if we assume arguendo that the pros<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>ecutor made some improper remarks, the prejudicial effect of the unobjected-to and relatively innocuous comments was not so great that they could not have been cured by a cautionary instruction. <em>People v Vaughn, </em>186 Mich App 376, 385; 465 NW2d 365 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">Defendant contends that the trial court should have granted defendant a new trial because the trial court admitted testimony regarding defendant\u2019s willingness to \u201cmake a deal.\u201d However, because the trial court sustained defendant\u2019s objection and followed both parties\u2019 motions to strike this testimony from the record, we find no error. See <em>McAlister, supra </em>at 504.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">Next, defendant claims that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel. We disagree. After a thorough review of the record, we conclude that defendant has neither sustained his burden of proving that counsel made a serious error that affected the result of trial nor overcome the presumption that counsel\u2019s actions were strategic. <em>People v LaVearn, </em>448 Mich 207, 213; 528 NW2d 721 (1995); <em>People v Stanaway, </em>446 Mich 643, 666, 687-688; 521 NW2d 557 (1994); see also <em>People v Hyland, </em>212 Mich App 701, 710; 538 NW2d 465 (1995), vacated in part on other grounds 453 Mich 900 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">Finally, defendant contends that the verdict was against the great weight of the evidence. We disagree. There was ample evidence to sustain defendant\u2019s convictions. <em>People v Wolfe, </em>440 Mich 508, 515; 489 NW2d 748 (1992), amended 441 Mich 1201 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b489-9\">Gribbs, P.J., concurred.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b481-8\"> This device is spelled inconsistently in the briefs and record as either \u201cDo-Rite\u201d or \u201cDo Right.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b481-9\"> Because the use of these Do-Rite sticks was not made an issue at trial, the record does not fully depict how this device is made or used.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b490-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>Mackenzie, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Apn\"><em>(concurring in part and dissenting in part). </em>I respectfully dissent from that portion of the majority opinion upholding the use of \u201cDo-Rite sticks.\u201d In my opinion, the evidence obtained against defendant through the use of the Do-Rite sticks should have been suppressed because the use of these pain compliance devices to obtain evidence for a prosecution violated the Due Process Clause of the United Sates Constitution. In all other respects, I concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">Arresting officer Bradley LaCross described the nature of Do-Rite sticks, and the use of the devices on defendant to obtain his compliance with the taking of a blood sample, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-6\"><em>Q. </em>What steps occurred then to get ahold of the situation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-7\"><em>A. </em>He was asked to lay [sic] down on the bed, which he refused to do. Finally, he was informed to lay [sic] down or we would lay him down on the bed, at which time Officer Troyer and myself laid Eric Hanna down on the bed and the do right [sic] sticks were applied to his wrists.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-8\"><em>Q. </em>And the do right [sic] sticks are restraints? I would just maybe have you explain to the jury what that is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-9\"><em>A. </em>They are two pieces of plastic approximately this long attached by approximately a one-inch rope. They are used to restrain people, are considered a technique for compliance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-10\"><em>Q. </em>What effect do they have upon the person they are applied to?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-11\"><em>A. </em>They are designed to gain compliance. <em>Once compliance is gained the pressure is supposed to be relieved in order to not cause any injury or long-term pain.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-12\">* <em>* </em>*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-13\">Q. And just explain to the jury as far as your action and your use of them as to Mr. Hanna. How did you do that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-14\"><em>A. </em>How did we apply them?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number><em>Q. </em>You say there was control on the amount of pressure?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-5\"><em>A. </em>I applied it at the wrist with soft hands. I applied pressure when the lab technician was coming up to draw the blood because Mr. Hanna started to pull away. <em>Pressure was applied. He was told repeatedly. At which time he complied after the pain was applied to him.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-6\"><em>Q. </em>Pain, it sounds pretty bad. Was it pinching? How does it all work?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-7\"><em>A. </em>It\u2019s just through pressure points that are learned through our training. <em>It\u2019s not a permanent pain. It\u2019s just real quick and simple. It is used for compliance for subjects that aren\u2019t cooperative.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-8\"><em>Q. </em>You indicated, I thought, soft hands, if I am quoting you correctly. What does that denote and relate it to other types of procedures that you might have used.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-9\"><em>A. </em>It wasn\u2019t used as a restraining instrument or any type of a weapon for use of force that way.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-10\"><em>Q. </em>Okay. Are they able to be used in that manner?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-11\"><em>A. </em>Yes, they are.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-12\"><em>Q. </em>If you had not had the do right [sic] devices at this time, Officer, would you have been able to get the blood?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-13\"><em>A. </em>No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-14\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-15\"><em>Q. </em>In the case here with Mr. Hanna how long did you have them applied to him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-16\"><em>A. </em>A few seconds.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-17\"><em>Q. </em>And was the same degree of pressure constant as far as the pair of restraints you were controlling?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-18\"><em>A. </em>There was a short, very short period of pressure, maybe two seconds, at which time he laid [sic] still. At that time the pressure was released and Mr. Hanna was informed if he didn\u2019t comply further pressure was going to be reapplied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-19\"><em>Q. </em>Now, what was his response to that statement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-20\"><em>A. </em>At that time he laid [sic] still. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b492-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>Defendant asserts that, as a matter of law, giving the police the ability to forcibly draw blood from an individual for a violation of the Vehicle Code amounts to cruel and unusual punishment, presumably under the Eighth Amendment. Because defendant was merely a detainee, however, the Eighth Amendment does not apply. See <em>Brewer v Perrin, </em>132 Mich App 520, 529, n 3; 349 NW2d 198 (1984). Nevertheless, the Due Process Clause protects a pretrial detainee from the use of excessive force that amounts to punishment. <em>Graham v Connor, </em>490 US 386, 395, n 10; 109 S Ct 1865; 104 L Ed 2d 443 (1989); <em>Bell v Wolfish, </em>441 US 520; 99 S Ct 1861; 60 L Ed 2d 447 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">The state may force a person suspected of driving while intoxicated to submit to a blood alcohol test. <em>South Dakota v Neville, </em>459 US 553, 559; 103 S Ct 916; 74 L Ed 2d 748 (1983); <em>Schmerber v California, </em>384 US 757, 771; 86 S Ct 1826; 16 L Ed 2d 908 (1966). Thus, in this case, requiring defendant to allow a sample of his blood to be taken did not in itself violate his substantive due process rights. However, as noted in <em>Schmerber, supra, </em>\u201c[i]t would be a different case if the police . . . responded to resistance with inappropriate force.\u201d <em>id. </em>at 760, n 4. See also <em>Neville, supra </em>at 559, n 9; <em>People v Holloway, </em>416 Mich 288, 299; 330 NW2d 405 (1982). In my opinion, the police in this case did just that.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">In <em>Rochin v California, </em>342 US 165, 166; 72 S Ct 205; 96 L Ed 183 (1952), police officers entered the defendant\u2019s home and observed him place some capsules in his mouth. The officers attempted to forcibly extract the capsules but were unable to do so. Following this,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>[Rochin] was handcuffed and taken to a hospital. At the direction of one of the officers a doctor forced an emetic solution through a tube into Rochin\u2019s stomach against his will. This \u201cstomach pumping\u201d produced vomiting. In the vomited matter were found two capsules which proved to contain morphine. <em>[Id. </em>at 166.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">Eventually, the defendant was convicted of illegally possessing morphine. The Supreme Court, in reversing Rochin\u2019s conviction under the Due Process Clause, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-6\">This is conduct that shocks the conscience. Illegally breaking into the privacy of the petitioner, the struggle to open his mouth and remove what was there, the forcible extraction of his stomach contents \u2014 this course of proceeding by agents of government to obtain evidence is bound to offend even hardened sensibilities. They are methods too close to the rack and the screw to permit of constitutional differentiation. <em>[Id. </em>at 172.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">Since <em>Rochin </em>was decided, the Supreme Court has clarified that claims of excessive force under the Due Process Clause should be analyzed under the Fourth Amendment \u201creasonableness\u201d standard. <em>Graham, supra </em>at 395. The question is not simply whether the force was necessary to accomplish a legitimate police objective; it is whether the force used was reasonable in light of all the relevant circumstances. <em>Hammer v Gross, </em>932 F2d 842, 846 (CA 9, 1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">The use of the Do-Rite sticks in this case was not reasonable under all the circumstances. Two officers were with defendant when his blood was drawn by a medical technician. Defendant repeatedly insisted that he did not want to be stuck with a needle because he was afraid of contracting AIDS. The officers each used the Do-Rite sticks when defendant, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>who was lying on a hospital bed, pulled his arms inward against his chest. Unquestionably, it was necessary to restrain defendant\u2019s movement for his own safety. Nevertheless, in my opinion, the use of the Do-Rite sticks was excessive. The record indicates that defendant was 5\u2019 9\u201d tall and weighed 170 pounds. Officer LaCross, on the other hand, was 6\u2019 1\u201d and weighed 250 pounds; he was a weight lifter who could bench press 300 pounds. Officer Troyer was 5\u2019 11\u201d and weighed 215 pounds. It was undisputed that it took a matter of seconds to draw the blood. The two officers should have been able to restrain the supine defendant for such a brief time without resort to pain compliance devices. There was also evidence that hospital restraints were available to the officers. Under these circumstances, I find it both shocking and unreasonable that defendant was forced into compliance through the use of pain-inflicting devices.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">The propriety of using devices called \u201cOrcutt Police Nonchakus,\u201d pain compliance tools which, like Do-Rite sticks, consist of two sticks each connected at one end by a cord, was addressed in <em>Forrester v San Diego, </em>25 F3d 804 (CA 9, 1994). Over a dissent, the two-judge majority upheld a jury finding that the police did not use excessive force in using the nonchakus against demonstrators. The dissenter distinguished between the use of <em>force </em>(possibly causing incidental pain) and the <em>direct infliction of pain </em>to coerce a person to act a certain way, and noted that the latter is, at least generally, constitutionally proscribed. The dissenter stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-6\">To be reasonable, force has to be designed to accomplish a legitimate objective efficiently. The objective was to make the demonstrators move from where they were seated to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>the vans. <em>But the force was not used to move the demonstrators into the vans. It was used to punish them for refusing to get up and walk to the vans. It worked as punishment does, by hurting people enough so that they do something to avoid it. </em>The nonchakus did not work like pinching the fatty part of the arm, or pulling a person by the finger, or a hammerlock, to move the demonstrators to the van. The nonchakus . . . were used as a pain inflicting device.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-5\">In this case, a more efficient pain compliance technique would have been for the officers to warn demonstrators that if they did not move voluntarily they would be burned with lighted cigarettes, and then hold the cigarettes against then skin until they complied. The pain would have been comparable, the risk of long term disability less than from tendon injury or fractures in the wrist, and the officers would have been able to keep one hand free. Probably one officer instead of two could have accomplished each arrest. I am quite sure we would not accept the use of lighted cigarettes against the skin as reasonable force in this case. Yet the nonchakus were worse. They inflicted more serious injuries, with longer lasting consequences, without working any better to arrest people rapidly with minimum police effort. The difference may be that nonchakus at least look like dragging devices. But they were not being used to drag, so that distinction does not work.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-7\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-8\">. . . The <em>Graham </em>standard of reasonable force bars this use of pain as a law enforcement tool. The intentional infliction of pain was not a reasonable means of achieving a legitimate end. <em>[Id. </em>at 813-814, 815 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-9\">I agree with this reasoning. Like <em>Forrester, </em>the devices in this case were not used to directly control the physical actions of a person, but rather, were used to inflict pain to coerce a person into compliance. As such, the use of the Do-Rite sticks must be condemned as unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>Finally, it should be noted that \u201cwhere power to punish is granted to persons in lower levels of administrative authority, there is an inherent and natural difficulty in enforcing the limitations of that power.\u201d <em>Jackson v </em>Bishop, 404 F2d 571, 579 (CA 8, 1968). In this case, Officer LaCross testified that he thought \u201cjust about everybody in the [Sault Ste. Marie police] department is qualified and certified\u201d in the use of Do-Rite sticks. The potential for abuse of this device by unscrupulous police officers is obvious, and it would be difficult to establish a departmental policy distinguishing between \u201cpermissible\u201d and impermissible levels of pain infliction.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">As the Supreme Court remarked in <em>Rochin, supra </em>at 173, \u201cto sanction the brutal conduct . . . would be to afford brutality the cloak of law.\u201d Because the evidence used against defendant to secure his conviction was obtained by unnecessary methods that offend the Due Process Clause, I would reverse.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
