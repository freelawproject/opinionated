We reject defendant\u2019s argument and hold, as a matter of law, that the dramshop statute does impose such liability where, as here, the statutory predicates are met.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">Defendant Gerald Hodge is the owner of Pete\u2019s Sake Pub in Detroit. Hodge\u2019s son, Michael (hereafter Hodge), is the pub\u2019s manager and serves as bartender. On the evening of May 14, 1993, Hodge was tending bar, and defendant Jason Debczak (the assailant), Jacqueline Notchel, Barbara Trebovich, and Tim Cheatham were in the pub. Debczak had arrived early in the evening and was still there at 2:00 A.M., the morning of May 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">Witnesses gave varying accounts of Debczak\u2019s state of intoxication at 2:00 A.M. Notchel testified that Debczak was staggering, slurring his speech, and acting obnoxious. Debczak himself testified that he was intoxicated and that Hodge served him at least eight beers and three shots before the assault. Hodge testified that Debczak did not appear to be intoxicated and that he had only consumed three or four beers while he was in the bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-9\">Around 2:00 A.M., plaintiff Matthew Weiss arrived at the pub, looking for his girlfriend. The girlfriend was a regular customer, and plaintiff disapproved of her patronization of the pub. There was also antipathy between plaintiff and Cheatham, apparently because plaintiff was jealous of Cheatham\u2019s friendship with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>the girlfriend. Notchel told plaintiff that his girlfriend was not there and then she asked plaintiff for a ride home.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">The testimony was conflicting about the next transaction: Debczak testified that Cheatham offered to pay Debczak $20 if he would assault plaintiff. Cheatham testified that Debczak removed $20 from Cheatham\u2019s wallet and offered to assault plaintiff if Cheatham would buy him more drinks.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">Shortly thereafter, when Notchel, Trebovich, and plaintiff left the pub, Debczak was waiting outside with a beer bottle in his hands. Debczak began to swear and speak abusively to plaintiff, and Debczak then smashed the beer bottle over plaintiff\u2019s head. The two struggled. Plaintiff, Notchel, and Trebovich all testified that Hodge emerged from the pub carrying a pool bridge and attempted to strike plaintiff with it. Plaintiff then got a baseball bat from his car to defend himself. Hodge testified, however, that he went outside to break up the fight and ordered the group to disperse, and that plaintiff then ran into the pub with a bat and smashed a window. According to Hodge, at that point he chased plaintiff out of the pub with a pool bridge, although Hodge denied hitting plaintiff. Notchel and Trebovich took plaintiff to the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">Plaintiff sued Debczak for intentional tort and he also sued Gerald Hodge on a dramshop theory, alleging that plaintiff lost time from work, incurred medical expenses, and suffered other physical, neurological, and psychological injury as a result of the assault. The jury found: (1) that plaintiff was injured by Debczak, (2) that Gerald Hodge furnished alcoholic liquor to Debczak when he was visibly intoxicated, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>(3) that the furnishing of alcoholic liquor to Debczak was the proximate cause of plaintiffs injuries, (4) that plaintiff had incurred damages of $175,000,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and (5) that plaintiffs injury was twenty percent attributable to Debczak\u2019s conduct and eighty percent attributable to Gerald Hodge. The trial court denied Gerald Hodge\u2019s motions for a new trial and for remittitur.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">Gerald Hodge appealed and the plaintiff cross appealed. Gerald Hodge then moved in this Court for a remand, arguing that our decision in <em>Rogalski v Tavernier, </em>208 Mich App 302; 527 NW2d 73 (1995), precluded dramshop liability when the allegedly intoxicated person (aip) has committed an intentional tort. Gerald Hodge\u2019s motion for remand was granted by this Court in an unpublished order entered January 17, 1996 (Docket No. 182881). On remand, the trial court determined that <em>Rogalski </em>should not change the outcome of the case. After remand, we agree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">in</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b637-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b637-9\">The dispositive issue here is whether a dramshop can be held liable for intentional torts. The starting point of analysis is the liability portion of the dram-shop statute itself:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>Except as otherwise provided in this section, an individual who suffers damage or is personally injured by a minor or visibly intoxicated person by reason of the unlawful selling, giving, or furnishing of alcoholic liquor to the minor or visibly intoxicated person, if the unlawful sale is proven to be a proximate cause of the damage, injury, or death, or the spouse, child, parent, or guardian of that individual, shall have a right of action in his or her name against the person who by selling, giving, or furnishing the alcoholic liquor had caused or contributed to the intoxication of the person or who has caused or contributed to the damage, injury, or death. In an action pursuant to this section, the plaintiff shall have the right to recover actual damages in a sum of not less than $50.00 in each case in which the court or jury determines that intoxication was a proximate cause of the damage, injury, or death. [MCL 436.22(4); MSA 18.993(4).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">We note initially that the dramshop statute itself draws no distinction between injuries caused by an intentional tort or those caused by a negligent tort. The language of the statute imposes liability simply where the requisite causal connection between the prohibited furnishing of liquor and the resulting injuries is met. The statute requires that if</p>\n<p id=\"Ad4\">\u2014an individual is injured by a \u201cminor or visibly intoxicated person,\u201d and</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">\u2014the injury resulted from the \u201cunlawful selling, giving, or furnishing of alcoholic liquor to the minor or visibly intoxicated person,\u201d and</p>\n<p id=\"Aac\">\u2014the unlawful sale of the alcohol \u201cis proven to be a proximate cause\u201d of the injury, then the individual who is injured \u201cshall have a right of action . . . against the person who by selling, giving, or furnishing the alcoholic liquor has caused or contributed to the intoxication of the person or who has caused or contributed to the damage, injury, or death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b639-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>While the statute does require that the sale of alcohol be a proximate cause of the resulting injury, it does not limit liability only to negligently inflicted injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">Further, defendant\u2019s reliance upon <em>Rogalski, supra, </em>for the proposition that the <em>dramshop statute </em>does not create liability for intentional torts is misplaced. <em>Rogalski </em>addressed the issue whether a social host who furnished alcoholic beverages to a minor in contravention of MCL 436.33; MSA 18.1004<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (the statute prohibiting the sale or furnishing of alcoholic liquor to minors) could be held liable for damages arising from the minor\u2019s criminal acts committed while under the influence of alcohol. Importantly, <em>Rogalski </em>did not address liability under the dramshop statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">Although <em>Rogalski </em>refused to extend tort liability to a host for intentional torts, its holding was premised on an interpretation of the statute prohibiting the sale <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>or furnishing of alcoholic liquor to minors, which, unlike the dramshop statute, does not by its terms create civil liability for its infraction. The statute prohibiting the sale or furnishing of alcoholic liquor to minors leaves it to our courts to interpret the civil consequences for its breach. <em>Longstreth v Gensel, </em>423 Mich 675; 377 NW2d 804 (1985). In <em>Rogalski, supra </em>at 307, our Court refused to extend judicially created consequences to intentional or criminal conduct based upon the statute prohibiting the sale or furnishing of alcoholic liquor to minors. In contrast, the dramshop statute states that, if the other requisites are met, liability may be imposed where the furnishing of alcohol is proved to be \u201ca proximate cause\u201d of the injury. We do not read this statute as affording this Court the discretion to impose liability only for negligently inflicted injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">Michigan case law also supports the foregoing interpretation of the dramshop statute; dramshop liability has been premised upon assaultive behavior of an intoxicated patron in earlier cases. In <em>Duma v Janni, </em>26 Mich App 445; 182 NW2d 596 (1970), we affirmed a jury verdict on a dramshop claim against a tavern, where liability was predicated upon an assault. There, the plaintiff returned from the dance floor to his seat in the tavern to discover the seat occupied by a stranger (the aip). The plaintiff three times asked the aip to leave his chair, and in response to the third request, the aip rose and violently struck the plaintiff. Before the plaintiff could stand up again, the bar owner and a bartender pounced on him until they were removed by the plaintiffs friends. The plaintiff sued the tavern on a dramshop theory and the jury found in the plaintiffs favor. On appeal, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>tavern\u2019s primary challenges were to the jury instructions and to inadequate proof of causation. However, the Court stated in Duma:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-5\">The jury could properly infer that the defendant\u2019s sale [of alcohol to the aip] contributed to [the aip\u2019s] intoxication. .. .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-6\">And, although [the aip] said he would be annoyed by the manner in which the plaintiff asked for the return of his chair even if he had been completely sober, he conceded that he is more easily provoked when he is under the influence of intoxicating liquor. It was for the jury to decide whether [the aip\u2019s] violent response was caused by his state of intoxication.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-7\">The trial judge\u2019s instructions to the jury on the causation issue were at least as favorable to the defendant as the provisions of the [dramshop] act. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-8\">The trial judge instructed the jury that it must find that the plaintiff proved that the defendant sold an intoxicating beverage to [the aip] while he was already intoxicated, that [the aip] drank the beverage and that this contributed to his intoxication, that the assault upon the plaintiff resulted wholly or in part from intoxication caused or contributed to by the act of the defendant in selling to [the aip], and that this was a contributing cause of the plaintiff\u2019s injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-9\">The defendant further contends that, even if the instructions were adequate, the plaintiff failed to prove that the act of the [aip], caused or contributed to the plaintiff\u2019s iqjury. He argues that the evidence established but equiponderant theories as to the cause of plaintiff\u2019s injury, forcing the jury to speculate as to the true cause. He claims that it was not determinable whether the injuries were caused by [the aip\u2019s] blow or by the pummeling at the hands of the [bar owner] .... We are persuaded, however, that the jury could properly conclude from the evidence that [the aip\u2019s] act caused the plaintiff\u2019s injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-10\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-11\">The judge correctly charged the jury that if it determined that \u201csome injury was inflicted upon [the plaintiff] by rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>son of some other event. . . then you must separate as best you can the injury that flowed from each separate cause.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-5\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-6\">. . . The issue is this case was whether the defendant [tavern] contributed to the intoxication of an intoxicated person who assaulted the plaintiff and caused him injury, not whether in the ensuing scuffle the defendant acted reasonably. The jury, by its verdict, found that the plaintiff\u2019s injuries were caused by the attack made upon him by the [aip], and that the defendant contributed to [the aip\u2019s] intoxication. <em>[Id. </em>at 448-452.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">Therefore, there is clear precedent for predicating dramshop liability upon assaultive conduct of an aip where there is sufficient evidence that furnishing the alcohol to the aip is a proximate cause of the violent behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-8\">This conclusion is supported by two other recent cases that, while not squarely addressing the issue of liability for intentional torts, have permitted dram-shop liability for intentional assaults inflicted by an inebriated patron upon another person. In <em>Brown v Swartz Creek Memorial Post 3720 </em>\u2014 Veterans <em>of Foreign Wars, Inc, </em>214 Mich App 15; 542 NW2d 588 (1995) (decided nine months after Rogalski), this Court implicitly held that liability against a licensee may be predicated on an aip\u2019s criminally assaultive behavior. In <em>Brown, </em>the aip drank at the defendant\u2019s facility and then went to the home of his estranged wife, where he assaulted the plaintiff (whom the AIP knew was having an affair with his wife). The plaintiff brought an assault and battery action against the aip and a dramshop action against the vfw. The jury found that the VFW did furnish alcohol to the aip while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>he was visibly intoxicated, that the vfw\u2019s act of furnishing the alcohol was a proximate cause of the plaintiff\u2019s injuries, and that the plaintiff was forty percent negligent. At trial, the plaintiff\u2019s comparative negligence was deducted only from the award in the tort action against the aip and no similar reduction was made in the award against the VFW. On appeal, this Court vacated the judgment against the vfw, on the ground that the judgment should have been reduced by the plaintiff\u2019s comparative fault:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-5\">[T]he application of comparative fault is more equitable in this case, because the vfw should not be held responsible for the intentional acts of the two combatants. The vfw\u2019s role was limited to supplying the alcohol. While the alcohol may have aggravated matters somewhat, the altercation was primarily attributable to the underlying animosity between the parties because of their own personal situation. Under these circumstances, the judgment [against the vfw] should be reduced to reflect the relative degree of fault of the plaintiff. <em>[Id. </em>at 24-25.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">Importantly, however, no new trial was ordered \u2014 the matter was simply remanded for entry of a new judgment. The decision thus supports the conclusion we reach in the instant case \u2014 that liability against a licensee may be predicated on assaultive behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">Similarly, in <em>Mariin v Fleur, Inc, </em>208 Mich App 631; 528 NW2d 218 (1995), the Court\u2019s analysis assumes that a dramshop action can be premised upon a physical assault. There, the plaintiff, an off-duty police officer socializing at a bar, was assaulted and injured in the bar by an aip. There was \u201cbad blood\u201d between the plaintiff and the aip because the plaintiff previously had arrested the aip in an unrelated incident. Following the assault, the plaintiff sued the aip and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>the bar, the latter under the dramshop act. The trial court granted summary disposition for the bar, finding liability foreclosed by the fireman\u2019s rule. However, on appeal, we reversed and remanded for further proceedings, finding the fireman\u2019s rule inapplicable because the plaintiff\u2019s presence at the bar was not occasioned by his duties as a police officer. <em>Id. </em>at 636. Again, the implicit assumption is that liability against the bar may be predicated upon assaultive acts of an AIP.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">In light of the language of the dramshop statute, as well as these cases that have permitted dramshop liability premised upon assaultive behavior of AlPs, we decline to adopt the reasoning of <em>Rogalski </em>in the dramshop context. The trial court did not err in concluding that <em>Rogalski </em>was inapplicable to a dramshop action.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">Gerald Hodge also asserts that the jury\u2019s verdict here was incongruent and legally inconsistent because the jury found the dramshop defendant eighty percent at fault and defendant Debczak only twenty percent at fault. Gerald argues that, because a liquor licensee\u2019s liability under the dramshop act is predicated on the liability of the AIP, it is not possible for the licensee to be four times more liable for the plaintiff\u2019s injuries than the aip. This argument appears to be based on two alternative theories: first, that the liquor licensee cannot, as a matter of law, be more culpable for the plaintiff\u2019s injuries than the aip, and, second, that the eighty percent/twenty percent apportionment of culpability in this case is unsupported by the evidence. We address both theories.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>This Court has, in dicta, indicated that dramshop liability is not derivative of the aip\u2019s liability. In <em>Archer v Burton, </em>91 Mich App 57; 282 NW2d 833 (1979), this Court recognized that it is conceivable that a licensee might be liable when the aip is not:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-5\">If an intoxicated person voluntarily engages in a fistfight, he is engaging in wrongful activity. Therefore, even if the intoxicated person is not liable to the plaintiff on the theory of self-defense or mutual fight, the bar might still be liable to the plaintiff if the defendant\u2019s intoxication by the bar was a contributing factor to his engaging in the fight. <em>[Id. </em>at 60-61.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">This statement, though not directly relevant here, indicates that a licensee\u2019s liability is not predicated on vicarious liability for the aip and that the licensee\u2019s conduct might be more culpable than the aip\u2019s conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">Further, the fact that comparative fault applies to dramshop actions supports the conclusion that the relative fault of the liquor licensee may exceed the liability of the aip. <em>Brown, supra </em>at 21-22. Thus, because juries in dramshop cases are required to apportion fault<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> among the multiple tortfeasors, including both the aip and the liquor licensee, this permits a jury to find varying degrees of culpability between these parties. Thus, contrary to Gerald\u2019s implicit argument, a liquor licensee\u2019s liability, although rooted in the aip\u2019s liability, is not necessarily equivalent to the aip\u2019s liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-8\">Gerald also asserts that the jury could not have rationally concluded that Gerald was four times more liable than Debczak and that this verdict must have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>been based on prejudice, passion, or an urge to punish Gerald. In substance, this is a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">Debczak testified that he would not have accepted Cheatham\u2019s offer to assault plaintiff for payment if he had not been intoxicated. Other witnesses testified that Debczak had been drinking in Pete\u2019s Sake Pub for several hours, that he was so intoxicated that his speech and walk were impaired, and that Michael Hodge continued to serve him despite his visible intoxication. Debczak testified that he frequently visited the bar and became intoxicated on each visit. On the basis of this evidence, a juror could conclude that the liquor licensee had greater culpability in this incident, because the licensee was responsible for allowing Debczak to reach so high a level of intoxication that he could not control his actions or resist Cheatham\u2019s offers. Viewing this evidence in a light most favorable to plaintiff, reasonable persons could agree that Gerald was four times more culpable than Debczak.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">In this section of his brief, Gerald also asserts that the trial court wrongfully refused to instruct the juiy that Debczak\u2019s defenses, including his intoxication defense, were also applicable to Gerald. Because the issue of instructional error was not raised in his statement of questions presented, review is inappropriate. <em>Hammack v Lutheran Social Services of Michigan, </em>211 Mich App 1, 7; 535 NW2d 215 (1995). However, were we to review this issue, we would conclude that the puipose of the dramshop statute would be seriously undermined if the AlP\u2019s defense of intoxication were applicable to the licensee.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>c</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">Gerald next asserts that the verdict and judgment should not be permitted to stand because neither complies with the statutory mandates of the tort reform act regarding specific findings for each defendant with respect to each type of damages. MCL 600.6305; MSA 27A.6305, MCL 600.6306; MSA 27A.6306.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In fact, the parties here <em>stipulated </em>that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>jury verdict form need not follow these statutes, and they waived any claim of violation of the tort reform act by using the shorter form. Thus, the issue is whether the trial court\u2019s agreement to disregard the statutory requirements and abide by the parties\u2019 stipulation constitutes error warranting reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">Where, as here, parties stipulate an arrangement that limits one party\u2019s rights to less than that which is otherwise required, that party may not later complain on appeal about this restriction. See <em>In re Vanidestine, </em>186 Mich App 205, 212; 463 NW2d 225 (1990) (the respondent in a delinquency proceeding who was charged with criminal sexual conduct involving a child was precluded from asserting Confrontation Clause error on appeal where he had stipulated at criminal trial that the child could testify via a two-way closed-circuit television). We do not, by this result, conclude that it is acceptable for a trial court to disregard the tort reform requirements, which, by their terms, are mandatory. We merely conclude that because Gerald stipulated the use of the short verdict form, he cannot now seek relief on the basis that the trial court accepted that stipulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">Gerald next contends that the jury verdict was grossly excessive and unduly influenced by passion and prejudice and, therefore, that he is entitled to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>new trial or remittitur. The proper consideration of the trial court in determining a motion for remittitur is whether the jury award was supported by the evidence. <em>Phillips v Deihm, </em>213 Mich App 389, 404; 541 NW2d 566 (1995). The trial court\u2019s inquiry is limited to objective considerations regarding the evidence adduced and the conduct of the trial. <em>Id. </em>Appellate courts must defer to a trial court\u2019s decision because of the trial court\u2019s superior ability to view the evidence and evaluate the credibility of the witnesses. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">Here, Gerald fails to make any specific arguments in support of his contention; his only point is that the size of the verdict proves that it was influenced by prejudice. We defer to the trial court\u2019s decision on a motion for remittitur; given the fact that Gerald points to nothing besides the size of the verdict to support his argument, we find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">Gerald also argues that the mediation award is a valid indication of the value of the damages. However, he cites no authority in support of this argument, and this Court will not search for authority to support a party\u2019s position. <em>Winiemko v Valenti, 203 </em>Mich App 411, 419; 513 NW2d 181 (1994). We decline to review the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">Gerald also argues that the evidence of damages did not support an award of this magnitude. However, plaintiff presented evidence that he suffered permanent brain damage that has seriously impaired his personality and cognitive abilities. Under these circumstances, the evidence could support the verdict. We therefore conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion for remittitur.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>E</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">In his cross appeal, plaintiff Weiss alleges that the circuit court erred in denying his motion for costs, based upon the offer of judgment rule, MCR 2.405. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">Here, defendant Hodge filed an offer to stipulate a judgment on July 15, 1994; twenty-eight days before trial. Plaintiff mailed his counteroffer on August 2, 1994; twenty-one days before trial. Although plaintiff ultimately prevailed at trial, the circuit court determined that plaintiffs counteroffer was untimely and denied plaintiffs request for costs pursuant to MCR 2.405 (offers to stipulate entry of judgment).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">MCR 2.405 provides that actual costs, including reasonable attorney fees of the prevailing party, may be imposed against a party who has rejected an offer to settle and thereafter receives a less favorable verdict. Subsections D(l), (2), and (3) of the rule provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-8\">(D) Imposition of Costs Following Rejection of Offer. If an offer is rejected, costs are payable as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-9\">(1) If the adjusted verdict is more favorable to the offeror than the average offer, the offeree must pay to the offeror the offeror\u2019s actual costs incurred in the prosecution or defense of the action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-10\">(2) If the adjusted verdict is more favorable to the offeree than the average offer, the offeror must pay to the offeree the offeree\u2019s actual costs incurred in the prosecution or defense of the action. <em>However, an offeree who has not made a counteroffer may not recover actual costs.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-11\">(3) The court shall determine the actual costs incurred. The court may, in the interest of justice, refuse to award an attorney fee under this rule. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b650-13\">\u201cCounteroffer\u201d is defined as \u201ca written reply to an offer, served within 21 days after service of the offer, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>in which a party rejects an offer of the adverse party and makes his or her own offer.\u201d MCR 2.405(A)(2). The rule also provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-5\">Offer. Until 28 days before trial, a party may serve on the adverse party a written offer to stipulate to the entry of a judgment for the whole or part of the claim, including interest and costs then accrued. [MCR 2.405(B).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">The issue here is whether a <em>counteroffer </em>must ,also be served twenty-eight days before trial in order for the offeree (the party making the counteroffer) to be eligible for costs under this rule. Here, the circuit court concluded that the counteroffer must indeed be served twenty-eight days before trial, and therefore the court denied plaintiffs motion for costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">Plaintiff relies on <em>Gudewicz v Matt\u2019s Catering, Inc, </em>188 Mich App 639; 470 NW2d 654 (1991), which we find instructive. In <em>Gudewicz, </em>the plaintiff made an offer of judgment thirty-one days before trial. The defendant counteroffered seventeen days before trial was scheduled to start. The jury returned a verdict that was more favorable to the defendant than the average offer, but the trial court determined that the defendant was not entitled to costs under the rule because the counteroffer was untimely. The trial court \u201cseemingly concluded that, because a party has twenty-one days to respond to a counteroffer, MCR 2.405(C)(3), defendant\u2019s counteroffer, made seventeen days before trial, came too late.\u201d <em>Gudewicz, supra, </em>at 642. This Court disagreed, reasoning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-8\">We believe that the trial court misconstrued the court rule. Under the rule, a party has twenty-one days to respond to an offer by either accepting, rejecting, or countering. Defendant\u2019s counteroffer was submitted within that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>twenty-one-day period and therefore should be deemed timely.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-5\">Under the trial court\u2019s construction, whenever a party submits an' offer twenty-eight days before trial, MCR 2.405(B), the offeree would be forced to either (1) counteroffer within seven days, contrary to the twenty-one-day period set forth at MCR 2.405(A)(2); (2) file a meaningless counteroffer to avoid the provision of MCR 2.405(D)(2) that an offeree who has not counteroffered may not recover actual costs; (3) accept the offer without benefit of negotiation in order to avoid possible sanctions under MCR 2.405(D); or (4) reject the offer without benefit of negotiation and risk the imposition of sanctions. Each of these alternatives greatly limits or effectively eliminates the offeree\u2019s right to submit a counteroffer. The result is that, by waiting until the eve of trial to make an offer to stipulate to entry of judgment, an offeror can severely restrict the negotiating position of his offeree while simultaneously assuring that the offeree will not be able to recover costs should negotiations fail and the offeree ultimately prevail.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-6\">The purpose of MCR 2.405 is to encourage settlement and to deter protracted litigation. <em>Sanders v Monical Machinery Co, </em>163 Mich App 689, 692; 415 NW2d 276 (1987). The result above is inconsistent with that purpose. Furthermore, in light of the obvious significance the Supreme Court has placed on counteroffers \u2014 by making them mandatory in order for a prevailing offeree to recover costs \u2014 we must reject that result.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-7\"><em>We conclude that when a party waits until shortly before trial to make an offer to stipulate to entry of judgment, the offeror must be deemed to have accepted the possibility of having less than the full twenty-one-day period to respond to a potential timely counteroffer. </em>This conclusion allows a party to make a last-minute offer, for strategic or other reasons, yet preserves the integrity of the offeree\u2019s right to submit a counteroffer within twenty-one days of the offer. In this case, the fact that plaintiffs chose to accept the possibility of having less than twenty-one days to respond to defendant\u2019s counteroffer did not render the counteroffer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>untimely, as the trial court held. [188 Mich App 642-643. Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">We agree with this reasoning and find defendant Hodge\u2019s reliance upon <em>Brooks v Gough, </em>189 Mich App 623; 473 NW2d 771 (1991), inapposite. Here, defendant Hodge waited until twenty-eight days before trial to make his offer; by so doing Hodge is deemed to have \u201caccepted the possibility of having less than the full twenty-one-day period to respond to [plaintiff\u2019s] counteroffer\u201d submitted a week later. <em>Gudewicz, supra </em>at 643. On remand, the circuit court should determine plaintiff\u2019s actual costs and determine whether plaintiff is entitled to an award of attorney fees. MCR 2.405(D)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">In conclusion, the jury verdict is affirmed and this matter is remanded for the limited purposes of determining (1) plaintiff\u2019s actual costs and (2) whether, in the interest of justice, an attorney fee award should be made under MCR 2.405(D)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded with instructions. We do not retain jurisdiction. Plaintiff, being the prevailing party, is entitled to costs pursuant to MCR 7.219.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b637-10\"> As -will be discussed later, the parties stipulated the use of a short-form jury verdict that did not comply with MCL 600.6305, 600.6306; MSA 27A.6305, 27A.6306, and they agreed to waive any claim of violation of the tort reform act by using the shorter form.
