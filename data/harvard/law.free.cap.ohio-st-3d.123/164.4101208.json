The first is whether this court\u2019s decision in <em>State v. Foster, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 1, 2006-Ohio-856, 845 N.E.2d 470, severed the repeat violent offender specification from the Revised Code and precluded trial courts from imposing an enhanced penalty for that specification. The second is whether a court engages in improper judicial fact-finding in violation of the right to a jury trial by designating an offender as a repeat violent offender pursuant to former R.C. 2929.01(DD).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-17\">{\u00b6 2} Hugh Hunter appeals from a decision of the Eighth District Court of Appeals that affirmed a judgment of the trial court imposing a two-year prison term for a repeat violent offender specification, running prior to and consecutive to an eight-year prison term for his felonious assault conviction. He contends that the repeat violent offender specification no longer exists after our decision in <em>Foster </em>and, further, that the findings necessary for a court to designate an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>offender as a repeat violent offender pursuant to former R.C. 2929.01(DD) violate the Sixth Amendment and the holdings in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey </em>(2000), 530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435, and subsequent United States Supreme Court decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">{\u00b6 3} After consideration, we have concluded that this court did not excise the repeat violent offender specification from the Revised Code in <em>Foster. </em>Moreover, in this instance, the trial court did not violate Hunter\u2019s right to a jury trial when it designated him as a repeat violent offender, because he waived his jury right, because he stipulated to the facts necessary to designate him as a repeat violent offender, and because it is within the purview of the court to determine the existence and nature of an offender\u2019s prior conviction. Thus, we affirm the decision of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">{\u00b6 4} On September 1, 2004, Hugh Hunter attacked Andrew McAuliffe at St. Malachi Church in Cleveland, causing multiple fractures and lacerations. A grand jury indicted Hunter for felonious assault and included in the indictment a repeat violent offender specification and notice of a prior conviction resulting from his 1990 conviction for felonious assault. The trial court found Hunter competent to stand trial and scheduled the matter for a jury trial to begin on October 23, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-9\">{\u00b6 5} At trial, Hunter stipulated to McAuliffe\u2019s medical records and to a prior conviction for felonious assault in 1990. He moved to bifurcate the trial, trying the felonious assault charge to the jury and the repeat violent offender specification to the court. He waived his right to a jury trial in regard to the specification, and asked the court to conduct a bench trial on that issue. The trial court accepted Hunter\u2019s written jury waiver and journalized it prior to commencing a jury trial on the felonious assault charge. The jury returned a verdict finding him guilty of felonious assault, and on October 25, 2006, the trial court conducted a bench trial on the repeat violent offender specification.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-10\">{\u00b6 6} Hunter further stipulated that during the commission of the offense of which he was previously convicted, he had caused physical harm to Gregory Rickett. The medical record to which Hunter stipulated indicated that Gregory Rickett had suffered a head wound that required stitches. The state then called Jimmy Shields, a Cuyahoga County Sheriffs deputy, who testified that he had investigated an incident in 1989 in which Hunter punched Rickett, an employee of the Cuyahoga County Jail, in the face, causing a laceration that required more than five stitches. Hunter did not call any witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-11\">{\u00b6 7} The trial court found that the state had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that \u201cMr. Gregory Rickett, the named victim * * * suffered physical harm <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>at the hand of Mr. Hugh Hunter for which Mr. Hugh Hunter was convicted and I believe served a prison sentence.\u201d Hunter did not object, and thus, the court sentenced him to two years for the repeat violent offender specification, to be served prior to and consecutively with eight years for his conviction on the felonious assault of McAuliffe.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">{\u00b6 8} Hunter appealed, arguing inter alia that our decision in <em>Foster </em>had entirely eliminated the repeat violent offender specification and that it was not possible for the trial court to designate him as a repeat violent offender pursuant to former R.C. 2929.01(DD) without violating his constitutional right to have a jury find all facts that would increase the severity of his sentence. The appellate court rejected his arguments, however, stating that Foster's severance of R.C. 2929.01(DD) meant only that judicial fact-finding is no longer required before a judge imposes an additional penalty on a repeat violent offender and holding that the trial court had properly imposed the additional penalty and had not violated Hunter\u2019s constitutional rights in doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">{\u00b6 9} Hunter has now appealed to this court on the following proposition of law: \u201cThe RVO-enhanced sentence imposed on appellant constituted a deprivation of his liberty without due process of law and a violation of his constitutional right to a trial by jury.\u201d He contends that the trial court lacked authority to impose an enhanced penalty for the repeat violent offender specification, asserting that <em>Foster </em>eliminated this specification in its entirety as violative of a defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to have a jury find all facts required to designate him as a repeat violent offender pursuant to former R.C. 2929.01(DD).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">{\u00b6 10} In response, the state contends that <em>Foster </em>excised only the portions of former R.C. 2929.14(D)(2)(b) that required judicial fact-finding in violation of the Sixth Amendment, not the repeat violent offender specification itself. The state argues that the trial court did not violate Hunter\u2019s constitutional rights by imposing an enhanced penalty for this specification.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">{\u00b6 11} Thus, two issues emerge for our consideration: one, whether <em>Foster </em>eliminated the repeat violent offender specification and second, whether the trial court conducted impermissible fact-finding in connection to the enhanced penalty it imposed on Hunter in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-9\">The Repeat Violent Offender Specification before <em>Foster</em></p>\n<p id=\"b280-10\">{\u00b6 12} At the time we decided <em>Foster, </em>three separate statutes pertained to repeat violent offender specifications. Former R.C. 2929.01(DD) identified findings that were required to be made by a court to designate an offender as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>\u201crepeat violent offender.\u201d 150 Ohio Laws, Part IV, 5707, 5719. R.C. 2941.149(B) specifically directs that \u201c[t]he court shall determine the issue of whether an offender is a repeat violent offender.\u201d Former R.C. 2929.14(D)(2)(b) set forth a range of penalty enhancements and listed the judicial findings necessary to impose them. 150 Ohio Laws, Part IV, 5734. Thus, imposition of an enhanced penalty for a repeat violent offender specification required a trial court to determine first, whether an offender was or was not a repeat violent offender, and second, which additional penalty, if any, would be appropriate. See, e.g., <em>State v. Payne, </em>Lake App. No. 2004-L-118, 2005-Ohio-7043, 2005 WL 3610429.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">{\u00b6 13} With respect to the designation of a repeat violent offender, former R.C. 2929.01(DD) provided:</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">{\u00b6 14} \u201c 'Repeat violent offender\u2019 means a person about whom both of the following apply:</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">{\u00b6 15} \u201c(1) The person has been convicted of or has pleaded guilty to, and is being sentenced for committing, for complicity in committing, or for an attempt to commit, aggravated murder, murder, involuntary manslaughter, a felony of the first degree other than one set forth in Chapter 2925 of the Revised Code, a felony of the first degree set forth in Chapter 2925 of the Revised Code that involved an attempt to cause serious physical harm to a person or that resulted in serious physical harm to a person, or a felony of the second degree that involved an attempt to cause serious physical harm to a person or that resulted in serious physical harm to a person.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">{\u00b6 16} \u201c(2) Either of the following applies:</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">{\u00b6 17} \u201c(a) The person previously was convicted of or pleaded guilty to, and previously served or, at the time of the offense was serving, a prison term for, any of the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b281-9\">{\u00b6 18} \u201c(i) Aggravated murder, murder, involuntary manslaughter, rape, felonious sexual penetration as it existed under section 2907.12 of the Revised Code prior to September 3, 1996, a felony of the first or second degree that resulted in the death of a person or in physical harm to a person, or complicity in or an attempt to commit any of those offenses;</p>\n<p id=\"b281-10\">{\u00b6 19} \u201c(ii) An offense under an existing or former law of this state, another state, or the United States that is or was substantially equivalent to an offense listed under division (DD)(2)(a)(i) of this section and that resulted in the death of a person or in physical harm to a person.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-11\">{\u00b6 20} \u201c(b) The person previously was adjudicated a delinquent child for committing an act that if committed by an adult would have been an offense listed in division (DD)(2)(a)(i) or (ii) of this section, [and] the person was committed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>the department of youth services for that delinquent act.\u201d 150 Ohio Laws, Part IV, 5719.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">{\u00b6 21} Former R.C. 2929.14(D)(2)(b) set forth circumstances pursuant to which a trial court could impose an enhanced penalty on a repeat violent offender:</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">{\u00b6 22} \u201cIf the court imposing a prison term on a repeat violent offender imposes the longest prison term from the range of terms authorized for the offense under division (A) of this section, the court may impose on the offender an additional definite prison term of one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, or ten years if the court finds that both of the following apply * * *:</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">{\u00b6 23} \u201c(i) The terms so imposed are inadequate to punish the offender and protect the public from future crime * * *.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-8\">{II24} \u201c(ii) The terms so imposed are demeaning to the seriousness of the offense * * *.\u201d 150 Ohio Laws, Part IV, 5734.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-9\">The Repeat Violent Offender Specification after <em>Foster</em></p>\n<p id=\"b282-10\">{\u00b6 25} In <em>Foster, </em>we followed the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey </em>(2000), 530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435, <em>Ring v. Arizona </em>(2002), 536 U.S. 584, 122 S.Ct. 2428, 153 L.Ed.2d 556, and <em>Blakely v. Washington </em>(2004), 542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403, and held that \u201cjudicial fact-finding before imposition of a sentence greater than the maximum term authorized by a jury verdict or admission of the defendant\u201d violates the right to a jury trial under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution. <em>Foster, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 1, 2006-Ohio-856, 845 N.E.2d 470, paragraph one of the syllabus, and \u00b6 53. We also specifically declared former R.C. 2929.14(D)(2)(b) unconstitutional, stating that it \u201crequires the court to make findings before imposing an additional penalty on repeat violent offenders and thus violates Blakely.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 78.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-11\">{\u00b6 26} Applying the remedy set forth in <em>United States v. Booker </em>(2005), 543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621, we severed those parts of the sentencing statutes that required unconstitutional fact-finding by a court, including former R.C. 2929.14(D)(2)(b). <em>Foster </em>at paragraphs two, four, and six of the syllabus. We held that \u201c[ajfter the severance, judicial fact-finding is not required before imposition of additional penalties for repeat-violent-offender and major-drug-offender specifications.\u201d Id. at paragraph six of the syllabus. Moreover, as we subsequently emphasized in <em>State v. Mathis, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 54, 2006-Ohio-855, 846 N.E.2d 1, <em>\u201cFoster </em>excised the requirement that the court make findings of fact before imposing (1) more than the minimum term on an offender who has never served a prison term, (2) the maximum term, (3) consecutive terms, and (4) <em>penalty enhancements for repeat violent offenders </em>or major drug offenders.\u201d (Emphasis added; footnotes omitted.) Id. at \u00b6 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>{\u00b6 27} Our opinions in <em>Foster </em>and <em>Mathis </em>patently demonstrate our intent to excise only the portions of former R.C. 2929.14(D)(2)(b) that required judicial fact-finding in violation of the Sixth Amendment and the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Apprendi </em>and <em>Blakely. </em>We never specifically precluded a trial court from imposing enhanced penalties for a repeat violent offender specification, nor did we excise the definition of a repeat violent offender as set forth in former R.C. 2929.01(DD). Furthermore, none of our decisions after <em>Foster </em>indicate that this specification no longer exists. Thus, <em>Foster </em>excised judicial fact-finding from former R.C. 2929.14(D)(2) but did not eliminate the repeat violent offender specification, as defined in former R.C. 2929.01(DD). Accordingly, Hunter\u2019s argument that <em>Foster </em>eliminated the repeat violent offender specification is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">Whether the Designation of a Repeat Violent Offender Pursuant to Former R.C. 2929.01(DD) Violates the Sixth Amendment</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">{\u00b6 28} In <em>Foster, </em>our analysis of the repeat violent offender specification focused on former R.C. 2929.14(D)(2)(b), which set forth the judicial findings necessary to determine the propriety of imposing an enhanced penalty on a repeat violent offender. We did not address, however, former R.C. 2929.01(DD), which set forth the criteria for designating an offender as a \u201crepeat violent offender.\u201d Generally, that statute required the court to find that the offender had a prior conviction and served a prison term for \u201c[a]ggravated murder, murder, involuntary manslaughter, rape, felonious sexual penetration * * *, [or] a felony of the first or second degree that resulted in the death of a person or in physical harm to a person.\u201d Former R.C. 2929.01(DD)(2)(a)(i), 150 Ohio Laws, Part IV, 5719.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-8\">{\u00b6 29} In this case, the trial court designated Hunter as a repeat violent offender pursuant to former R.C. 2929.01(DD) based on his stipulation that he had a prior conviction for felonious assault with a specification of physical harm and on a finding that he had served a prison term for that prior conviction. Hunter now contends that he has the right under the Sixth Amendment to have the jury make those findings. For three reasons, however, the trial court did not violate Hunter\u2019s right to a jury trial: first, he waived that right; second, he stipulated to the facts required to make the designation; and third, the Sixth Amendment does not preclude a sentencing court from considering information in the judicial record from the prior conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-9\">\n<em>Waiver</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b283-10\">{\u00b6 30} As the court stated in <em>Blakely, </em>\u201cnothing prevents a defendant from waiving his <em>Apprendi </em>rights [to a jury determination of every element of the charge]. * * * Even a defendant who stands trial may consent to judicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>factfinding as to sentence enhancements, which may well be in his interest if relevant evidence would prejudice him at trial.\u201d 542 U.S. at 310, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403. We recognized this in <em>Foster </em>and explained that while the Sixth Amendment generally prohibits judicial fact-finding, there is an \u201cexception for prior criminal convictions <em>and the defendant\u2019s consent to judicial fact-finding.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added; footnote omitted.) 109 Ohio St.3d 1, 2006-Ohio-856, 845 N.E.2d 470, \u00b6 7. Furthermore, in <em>State v. Payne, </em>114 Ohio St.3d 502, 2007-Ohio-4642, 873 N.E.2d 306, we recognized that <em>Apprendi/Blakely </em>errors may be waived, stating that <em>\u201cif Payne had knowingly waived his rights, </em>* * * <em>we would conclude our analysis.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Id. at \u00b6 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">{\u00b6 31} In this case, even if we assume that Hunter had a constitutional right to have the jury determine his status as a repeat violent offender pursuant to former R.C. 2929.01(DD), he chose to submit that determination to the court to avoid presenting evidence of his prior conviction for felonious assault to the jury at trial. Therefore, Hunter has waived whatever right he had with respect to the repeat violent offender specification. See <em>Blakely, </em>542 U.S. at 310, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403; <em>Payne, </em>114 Ohio St.3d 502, 2007-Ohio-4642, 873 N.E.2d 306, \u00b6 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">\n<em>Stipulation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">{\u00b6 32} In addition, it is noteworthy that Hunter stipulated to all the facts necessary for the trial court to designate him as a repeat violent offender pursuant to former R.C. 2929.01(DD). Specifically, Hunter stipulated to an indictment charging him with felonious assault and specifying that he had caused physical harm to the victim, that he had pleaded guilty to the offense \u201cas charged in the indictment,\u201d and that the trial court had sentenced him to prison. Neither has Hunter challenged the trial court\u2019s finding that he had served a prison term for his earlier offense. The additional testimony and evidence offered by the state to prove that Hunter had caused physical harm while committing his prior offense was superfluous.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">{\u00b6 33} Because of Hunter\u2019s stipulations, the trial court had no need to conduct fact-finding in connection with former R.C. 2929.01(DD), and no Sixth Amendment violation occurred in this case. <em>Blakely, </em>542 U.S. at 310, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (defendant may waive <em>Apprendi </em>rights); see also <em>Smith v. Petkovich </em>(N.D.Ohio 2008), 562 F.Supp.2d 912, 944 (citing former R.C. 2929.01(DD) and holding that no Sixth Amendment violation occurred because \u201cSmith stipulated as to the truth of all facts necessary to allow the court to find that Smith was a repeat violent offender\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>\n<em>Judicial fact-finding within the province of the court</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">{\u00b6 34} Even if Hunter had not waived his right to a jury trial or stipulated to the required facts, the fact-finding conducted by the trial court to designate him as a repeat violent offender pursuant to former R.C. 2929.01(DD) would not have violated the Sixth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">{\u00b6 35} In <em>Oregon v. Ice </em>(2009), \u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 711, 714, 172 L.Ed.2d 517, the Supreme Court reiterated its holdings in <em>Apprendi </em>and <em>Blakely </em>that \u201cit is within the jury\u2019s province to determine any fact <em>(other than the existence of a prior </em>conviction) that increases the maximum punishment authorized for a particular offense.\u201d (Emphasis added.) And as the Supreme Court noted in <em>Apprendi, </em>the Sixth Amendment does not bar judicial consideration of a defendant\u2019s prior convictions at sentencing because \u201c \u2018recidivism * * * is a traditional, if not the most traditional, basis for a sentencing court\u2019s increasing an offender\u2019s sentence.\u2019 \u201d 530 U.S. at 488, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435, quoting <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States </em>(1998), 523 U.S. 224, 244, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">{\u00b6 36} Significantly, the Sixth Amendment does not limit a sentencing court\u2019s consideration to the <em>existence </em>of a prior conviction. On the contrary, the United States Supreme Court has held that courts may consider the information contained in court documents that are related to the prior conviction. In <em>Shepard v. United States </em>(2005), 544 U.S. 13, 19-20, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205, the court held that a sentencing court, when determining whether a prior conviction warrants an enhanced penalty under the federal Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d), may consider \u201cthe charging documents, jury instructions, a bench-trial judge\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law, the terms of a plea agreement, a transcript of the plea colloquy or other comparable judicial records.\u201d See also <em>Taylor v. United States </em>(1990), 495 U.S. 575, 602, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (holding that for purposes of penalty enhancement, a sentencing court may determine the nature of a predicate offense from the statutory elements, charging documents, and jury instructions).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-9\">{\u00b6 37} Relying on the decisions in <em>Apprendi, Blakely, Shepard, </em>and <em>Taylor, </em>several of our sister states have also held that sentencing courts may look beyond the mere existence of a prior conviction without violating the Sixth Amendment. For example, in <em>Ryle v. State </em>(Ind.2005), 842 N.E.2d 320, the Supreme Court of Indiana affirmed an enhanced sentence based on a judicial finding from information about a prior offense contained in a presentence investigation report. The court stated that \u201c[t]he presentence investigation report relies on \u2018judicial record^]\u2019 that guarantee the conclusive significance that is the focus of <em>Apprendi.\u201d </em>Id. at 325, quoting <em>Shepard, </em>544 U.S. at 26, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205. See also <em>People v. McGee </em>(2006), 38 Cal.4th 682, 687, 42 Cal.Rptr.3d 899, 133 P.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>1054 (\u201cthe trial court in the present case did not violate defendant\u2019s rights by-examining the record of the robbery convictions previously sustained by defendant in Nevada and by concluding that each of these offenses constituted a conviction of a \u2018serious felony\u2019 for purposes of the applicable California sentencing statute\u201d); <em>State v. Pierce </em>(2006), 188 N.J. 155, 163, 902 A.2d 1195 (\u201cwe find no Sixth Amendment violation in the sentencing court\u2019s consideration of objective facts about defendant\u2019s prior convictions, such as the dates of convictions, his age when the offenses were committed, and the elements and degrees of the offenses, in order to determine whether he qualifies as a \u2018persistent offender\u2019 \u201d for sentence-enhancement purposes); <em>People v.

Fagan </em>(2006), 280 Conn. 69, 100, 905 A.2d 1101 (\u201cthe defendant\u2019s status as to whether he lawfully had been on release at the time of the offense for which he was convicted * * * was a question that also did not require a jury determination\u201d); <em>State v. Jones </em>(2006), 159 Wash.2d 231, 247, 149 P.3d 636 (\u201cbecause the community placement sentence determination * * * can be readily determined by a limited examination of the record flowing from the prior conviction, we conclude that a court, rather than a jury, may, pursuant to <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>make, constitutionally, the * * * community placement determination\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">{\u00b6 38} Thus, pursuant to <em>Shepard, </em>544 U.S. 13, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205, we hold that when designating an offender as a repeat violent offender pursuant to former R.C. 2929.01(DD), a trial court does not violate the Sixth Amendment by considering relevant information about the offender\u2019s prior conviction that is part of the judicial record.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">{\u00b6 39} In this case, in order to declare Hunter a repeat violent offender, the court had to determine whether he had a prior conviction and had served a prison term for a felony of the first or second degree that resulted in physical harm to the victim. Former R.C. 2929.01(DD)(1) and (2)(a)(i). These facts may be readily determined from the indictment and sentencing entry for his 1990 conviction for felonious assault with a specification of physical harm and his resulting sentence of eight to 15 years\u2019 incarceration. The trial court did not violate Hunter\u2019s constitutional rights by considering these documents, which are \u201cjudicial record evidence\u201d created in connection with his prior conviction. <em>Shepard, </em>544 U.S. at 20, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205. Moreover, the findings required by former R.C. 2929.01(DD) pertain directly to the issue of recidivism, which has traditionally been within the purview of the sentencing court, not the jury, <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>523 U.S. at 244, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350, and Hunter has not suggested that the trial court\u2019s findings in this case are erroneous.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Aoo\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>William D.
