Chapter 4112, as amended by the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, 138 Ohio Laws, Part I, 1430, 1431-1432. We originally accepted Allen\u2019s discretionary appeal, which sought review of the issue whether Ohio law prohibits an employer from discriminating against a female employee because of or on the basis of lactation. For the reasons stated below, we find that summary judgment was properly granted for appellee, totes/Isotoner Corporation (\u201cIsotoner\u201d), against appellant, LaNisa Allen, on her claims for wrongful termination. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-11\">{\u00b6 2} In its opinion affirming the grant of summary judgment to the employer, the Twelfth District Court of Appeals ruled that Allen had failed to establish a prima facie case of sex discrimination on the basis of pregnancy, and it concluded that Allen\u2019s termination does not violate Ohio public policy against discrimination on the basis of pregnancy. The appellate court ruled that Allen \u201cwas simply and plainly terminated as an employee at will for taking an unauthorized, extra break.\u201d <em>Allen v. totes/Isotoner </em>(Apr. 7, 2008), Butler App. No. CA2007-08-196, \u00b6 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-12\">{\u00b6 3} Allen admitted in her deposition that for approximately two weeks, she had taken breaks without her employer\u2019s knowledge or authorization to do so and that her supervisor had told her that she was being terminated for her failure to \u201cfollow directions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b330-13\">{\u00b6 4} As a general matter, if a plaintiff establishes a prima facie case of disparate-treatment employment discrimination under R.C. Chapter 4112, the burden of production shifts to the employer to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its treatment of the plaintiff. See, e.g., <em>Plumbers &amp; Steamfit</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number><em>ters Joint Apprenticeship Commt. v. Ohio Civ. Rights Comm. </em>(1981), 66 Ohio St.2d 192, 197-198, 20 O.O.3d 200, 421 N.E.2d 128; <em>St. Mary\u2019s Honor Ctr. v. Hicks </em>(1993), 509 U.S. 502, 506-507, 113 S.Ct. 2742, 125 L.Ed.2d 407 (analyzing the federal employment-discrimination statute). The ultimate burden of persuading the trier of fact that the employer intentionally discriminated against the plaintiff based upon an impermissible category remains on the plaintiff. Id. at 507, 113 S.Ct. 2742, 125 L.Ed.2d 407.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\">{\u00b6 5} Legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons in Ohio law include insubordination. <em>Hood v. Diamond Prods., Inc. </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 298, 302, 658 N.E.2d 738. If the employer carries its burden of articulating a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its employment decision, the plaintiff must prove that the employer\u2019s stated nondiscriminatory reasons were a pretext for impermissible discrimination. Id.; see also <em>St. Mary\u2019s Honor Ctr., </em>509 U.S. at 519, 113 S.Ct. 2742, 125 L.Ed.2d 407. If an employment-discrimination plaintiff fails to establish a triable factual issue on an essential element of her case, summary judgment for the employer is appropriate. See, e.g., <em>Simpson v. Des Moines Water Works </em>(C.A.8, 2005), 425 F.3d 538, 542.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">{\u00b6 6} In this case, the evidence in the record demonstrates that Allen took unauthorized breaks from her workstation, and Isotoner discharged her for doing so. Thus, the record as it was developed in the trial court fails to provide a basis from which a jury could conclude that Isotoner\u2019s articulated legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for Allen\u2019s termination \u2014 failure to follow directions \u2014 was a pretext for discrimination based on Allen\u2019s pregnancy or a condition related to her pregnancy. This determination defeats Allen\u2019s sex-discrimination claim under R.C. 4112.02 as a matter of law, and, accordingly, the trial court properly granted summary judgment to Isotoner. Consequently, this court does not reach the issue whether alleged discrimination due to lactation is included within the scope of Ohio\u2019s employment-discrimination statute, R.C. 4112.02, as sex discrimination under R.C. 4112.01(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">{\u00b6 7} Because summary judgment was properly entered against Allen, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b331-8\">Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Donnell, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b331-9\">Moyer, C.J., and O\u2019Connor, J., concur in judgment only.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b331-10\">Pfeifer, J., dissents.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b331-11\">Lanzinger, J., would dismiss the appeal as having been improvidently accepted.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b331-12\">O\u2019Donnell, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Ak0\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>{\u00b6 8} I concur in the judgment affirming the summary judgment in totes/Isotoner\u2019s favor, because totes/Isotoner discharged LaNisa Allen for taking an unauthorized break from her scheduled employment. That fact is undisputed in the record before us, and Allen failed to carry her burden of proving either that totes/Isotoner had a discriminatory motive or that its reason for discharging her was a pretext for discrimination. Consequently- \u2014 and necessarily, in accordance with long-standing prudential considerations widely utilized by the courts \u2014 I would not reach the issue whether adverse differential treatment because of postpregnancy lactation falls within actionable discrimination as defined by the General Assembly in R.C. Chapter 4112.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">{\u00b6 9} It is the long-standing practice of courts to decide only issues presented by the facts and to refrain from deciding issues that the facts do not place directly at issue. Because of the relevant and determinative facts of this case, the resolution of the dispute of the parties before us does not turn on whether R.C. 4112.02 encompasses alleged discrimination due to lactation. Because the court need not reach this issue, any opinion expressed on the issue would be merely advisory and not in accordance with the long-standing practice of courts to decline to render advisory opinions.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">{\u00b6 10} It is well-settled law that this court will not issue advisory opinions. <em>State ex rel. White v. Kilbane Koch, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 395, 2002-Ohio-4848, 775 N.E.2d 508, \u00b6 18, citing <em>State ex rel Baldzicki v. Cuyahoga Cty.

Thomas </em>(1970), 22 Ohio St.2d 13, 14, 51 O.O.2d 35, 257 N.E.2d 371. Because the court need not reach the issue of whether discrimination on the basis of lactation is prohibited by R.C. 4112.02, it should not do so. See <em>PDK Laboratories, Inc. v. United States Drug Enforcement Adm. </em>(C.A.D.C.2004), 362 F.3d 786, 799 (Roberts, J., concurring in part and in the judgment, \u201cif it is not necessary to decide more, it is necessary not to decide more\u201d).</p>\n<judges id=\"b332-6\">Lundberg Stratton and Cupp, JJ., concur in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b332-7\">Moyer, C.J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ABM\">concurring in judgment only.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">{\u00b6 11} I agree that summary judgment was properly entered against the appellant, LaNisa Allen, and thus I concur in the judgment.

Chapter 4112 (\u201cFEPA\u201d), as amended by Ohio\u2019s Pregnancy Discrimination Act (\u201cPDA\u201d), 138 Ohio Laws, Part I, 1430, 1431-1432; that her termination was against public policy; that her \u201cmedical condition, the act of lactating, constitutes a \u2018handicap\u2019 \u201d for purposes of the FEPA; and that she had been discriminated against on the basis of her handicap under the Americans with Disabilities Act (\u201cADA\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">{\u00b6 13} We asserted discretionary jurisdiction to review three propositions of law that arise from the claims in this case, <em>Allen v. totes/Isotoner Corp., </em>119 Ohio St.3d 1443, 2008-Ohio-4487, 893 N.E.2d 515, including the assertion that \u201clactation is a physical condition associated with pregnancy and childbirth, hence the FEPA, as amended by the Ohio PDA, prohibits discrimination against females because they are lactating.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">{\u00b6 14} I agree that appellee Allen failed to develop a record from which a jury could find in her favor. But because the trial and appellate courts erroneously applied inapposite federal precedent in their analysis of Allen\u2019s claims, I believe that this court should reach the merits to clarify the law. I therefore concur in judgment only. I write separately to set forth why I would hold that lactation falls within the scope of R.C. 4112.01(B) and that the statute prohibits employment discrimination against lactating women. R.C. 4112.02. In doing so, I am fully aware of the assertion that my opinion is advisory. I disagree. The lead opinion\u2019s failure to address the legal framework in which this case arises is disappointing, and it is even more troubling that we fail to address the scope of Ohio law under the guise that reaching the merits would result in an advisory opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">{\u00b6 15} The bald assertion that any opinion analyzing Allen\u2019s claim would be advisory is patently unpersuasive. Indeed, the cases cited by the concurring opinion, essentially, are ones in which we found an issue to be moot on appeal and therefore refused to provide advisory opinions. The cases cited are wholly distinguishable from this appeal, however. See <em>State ex rel. White v.

See <em>Heasley, </em>113 Ohio St.3d 133, 2007-Ohio-1248, 863 N.E.2d 142, at \u00b6 11, quoting <em>Bilyeu v. Motorists Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1973), 36 Ohio St.2d 35, 37, 65 O.O.2d 179, 303 N.E.2d 871. Allen, a lactating employee, was terminated from employment for not following directions \u2014 i.e., for taking an unauthorized break from her work station in order to use a breast pump. The determination of whether that action was lawful cannot be made in a vacuum. Rather, the determination depends on the facts she marshals <em>as well as </em>the state of the law in Ohio, <em>not </em>the state of federal law as defined in the federal courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">{\u00b6 20} The principle of judicial restraint, that \u201cif it is not necessary to decide more, it is necessary not to decide more,\u201d <em>PDK Laboratories, Inc. v. United States Drug Enforcement Admin. </em>(C.A.D.C.2004), 362 F.3d 786, 799 (Roberts, J., concurring in part and in judgment), is an important one. But here, it is inapplicable because it is necessary to decide \u201cmore.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">{\u00b6 21} The question whether Ohio law recognizes discrimination claims based on lactation is one of great general interest. Allen and Isotoner, as well as all Ohio\u2019s employees and employers, are entitled to the answer and to guidance on the contours of Ohio\u2019s employment laws. It is our duty to provide that guidance and to answer the questions posed in this controversy. <em>Fortner v. Thomas </em>(1970), 22 Ohio St.2d 13, 14, 51 O.O.2d 35, 257 N.E.2d 371 (\u201cit is the duty of every judicial tribunal to decide actual controversies between parties legitimately affected by specific facts and to render judgments which can be carried into effect\u201d). I thus proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b335-8\">{\u00b6 22} In entering summary judgment against Allen, the trial court found that Allen had not been discriminated against on the basis of pregnancy. According to the trial court, \u201cAllen gave birth over five months prior to her termination from [Isotoner]. Pregnant [women] who give birth and chose not to breastfeed or pump their breasts do not continue to lactate for five months. Thus, Allen\u2019s condition of lactating was not a condition relating to pregnancy but rather a condition related to breastfeeding. Breastfeeding discrimination does not constitute gender discrimination. See <em>Derungs v. Wal-Mart Stores Inc., </em>374 F.3d 428, 439 (6th Cir.2004).\u201d Upon that finding, the court found that postpartum lactation and the discomfort associated with it are not disabilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-9\">{\u00b6 23} The court of appeals affirmed. In a conclusory decision, it held that Allen had not presented a prima facie case of sex discrimination on the basis of pregnancy and that her termination did not offend Ohio public policy. <em>Allen v. totes/Isotoner Corp. </em>(Apr. 7, 2008), Butler App. No. CA2007-08-196. According to the court of appeals, \u201cappellant was not terminated because she was lactating, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>pumping breast milk, or needed to take a break to pump breast milk. Rather, she was simply and plainly terminated as an employee at will for taking an unauthorized, extra break (unlike the restroom breaks which were authorized and available to all of the employees, appellant included).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">\n<em>Pregnancy and Lactation as Objects of Sex Discrimination</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">{\u00b6 24} Among other things, the FEPA prohibits an employer from discharging or discriminating against a person in the tenure, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment because of the person\u2019s sex or disability. R.C. 4112.02(A). Through the PDA amendments to the FEPA, which became effective in 1980, the General Assembly has made clear that the statutory phrases \u201cbecause of sex\u201d and \u201con the basis of sex\u201d include all claims \u201cbecause of or on the basis of pregnancy, any illness arising out of and occurring during the course of a pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions. Women affected by pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions shall be treated the same for all employment-related purposes * * R.C. 4112.01(B). The amended statutory framework now embodied in Ohio\u2019s FEPA developed similarly to its federal counterpart, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, section 2000e(k), Title 42, U.S.Code, the federal Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">{\u00b6 25} In the wake of the controversial decision <em>Gen. Elec. Co. v. Gilbert </em>(1976), 429 U.S. 125, 139-140, 97 S.Ct. 401, 50 L.Ed.2d 343, in which the United States Supreme Court rejected a disparate-treatment sex-discrimination claim based on a disability insurance plan\u2019s refusal to cover pregnancy-related disabilities, Congress amended Title VII to make clear that sex-discrimination includes discrimination based on pregnancy. See, e.g., <em>California Fed. S. &amp; L. Assn. v. Guerra </em>(1987), 479 U.S. 272, 284-285, 107 S.Ct. 683, 93 L.Ed.2d 613; <em>Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Co. v. Equal Emp. Opportunity Comm. </em>(1983), 462 U.S. 669, 678, 103 S.Ct. 2622, 77 L.Ed.2d 89.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">{\u00b6 26} The federal PDA explicitly expanded the terms \u201cbecause of sex\u201d and \u201con the basis of sex\u201d to include the concepts \u201cbecause of or on the basis of pregnancy, childbirth, or other related conditions\u201d and to affirm that \u201c \u2018women affected by pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions shall be treated the same for all employment-related purposes * * * as other persons not so affected but similar in their ability or inability to work.\u2019 \u201d <em>Fortier v. U.S. Steel Corp. </em>(June 4, 2002), W.D.Pa. No. 01-cv-2029, 2002 WL 1797796, *3, quoting Section 2000e(k), Title 42, U.S.Code. The essential command of the PDA is that an employer must maintain the same neutrality toward an employee\u2019s pregnancy as it would an employee\u2019s race, gender, or other protected-class status. <em>Pacourek v. Inland Steel Co. </em>(N.D.Ill.1994), 858 F.Supp. 1393, 1400. And the legislative history of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>the federal PDA suggests strongly that neutrality must be maintained before, during, and after a pregnancy. Id. at 1402, citing 123 Congressional Record 29385 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">{\u00b6 27} Soon after Congress enacted the PDA amendments to Title VII, Ohio followed suit. <em>Derungs, </em>374 F.3d at 436 (after <em>Gilbert </em>and the passage of the federal PDA, the Ohio General Assembly amended R.C. 4112.02(A) by adopting the Ohio PDA, R.C. 4112.01(B), in 1980). The Ohio General Assembly\u2019s unambiguous intent in passing the Ohio PDA is well understood. \u201cHaving incorporated the [federal] PDA\u2019s language almost verbatim into the definitional provisions of \u00a7 4112, it is clear to us that the Ohio Legislature was aware of the meaning and rationale of <em>Gilbert, </em>as well as being aware of the PDA. The Legislature made a conscious choice to extend the definition of discrimination to include pregnancy even though there cannot be a class of similarly situated males.\u201d <em>Derungs, </em>374 F.3d at 436.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">{\u00b6 28} In evaluating Allen\u2019s claims, the trial and appellate courts ignored the foregoing history. Rather, central to both courts\u2019 analysis is the Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Derungs, </em>a public-accommodations case brought by a woman who had been prohibited from breast-feeding her infant while sitting on a bench near a dressing room in a Walmart store. <em>Derungs v. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. </em>(S.D.Ohio 2000), 141 F.Supp.2d 884, 886. In that case, the district court granted partial summary judgment in favor of Walmart on the plaintiffs claims for sex and age discrimination in violation of R.C. 4112.02(G), and the Sixth Circuit affirmed. <em>Derungs, </em>374 F.3d at 440.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">{\u00b629} In rendering their decisions, the federal courts applied the <em>Gilbert </em>analysis that had been rejected expressly by both Congress and the Ohio Legislature. See <em>Derungs, </em>141 F.Supp.2d at 889-892. In doing so, the federal courts decided the case on federal case law. Id. at 889-893.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">{\u00b6 30} Significantly for purposes here, <em>Derungs </em>did not involve employment discrimination, but rather, a claim for discrimination in public accommodations. And as the federal courts recognized, when the Ohio General Assembly passed the PDA, it did not amend the public-accommodations portion of R.C. Chapter 4112. See <em>Derungs, </em>141 F.Supp.2d at 889, fn. 7; see also <em>Derungs, </em>374 F.3d at 436.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-9\">{\u00b6 31} I find that fact significant. <em>Derungs </em>is inapposite here because its analysis revolves around a portion of R.C. Chapter 4112 that was not amended by the PDA. And evidently, <em>Derungs </em>did not reflect Ohio legislators\u2019 view of the law: after <em>Derungs </em>was decided, the Ohio General Assembly enacted R.C. 3781.55, which permits a mother to breast-feed her child in a place of public accommodation.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-10\">{\u00b6 32} I recognize that the federal courts\u2019 analysis in <em>Derungs </em>is not inconsistent with the federal courts\u2019 continued reliance on <em>Gilbert </em>notwithstanding the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>PDA. Reasonable minds may differ about the merit of the rule set forth in <em>Gilbert. </em>But given our legislature\u2019s clear and unambiguous rejection of the <em>Gilbert </em>analysis, I decline to apply those rationales in our analysis of pregnancy-discrimination claims brought under the gender-equity prong of the FEPA.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Given the clarity with which our legislature has spoken on this issue and its insistence that gender-based discrimination can include pregnancy-based discrimination, we should engage in a meaningful analysis centered on the statutory language.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">{\u00b6 33} Ohio\u2019s PDA affords protection to employees \u201cbecause of or on the basis of pregnancy\u201d and states that \u201c[w]omen affected by pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions shall be treated the same for all employment-related purposes * * * as other persons not so affected but similar in their ability or inability to work * * R.C. 4112.01(B). That language is broad.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">{\u00b6 34} \u201cRelated\u201d and \u201caffected\u201d are expansive terms. \u201cRelated\u201d means \u201cconnected by reason of an established or discoverable relation,\u201d and \u201crelation\u201d means \u201can aspect or quality (as resemblance) that connects two or more things or parts as being or belonging or working together or as being of the same kind.\u201d Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary (10th Ed.1993) 987. \u201cAffected,\u201d the past tense of \u201caffect,\u201d means \u201c[having] produce[d] an effect upon\u201d and \u201c[having] produce[d] a material influence upon.\u201d Id. at 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">{\u00b6 35} Despite this broad language, the trial court found that discrimination on the basis of lactation is not the same as discrimination on the basis of pregnancy because \u201cAllen\u2019s condition of lactating was not a condition relating to pregnancy but rather a condition relating to breastfeeding.\u201d I find that conclusion curious and inaccurate.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">(\u00b6 36} Lactation \u2014 the formation and secretion of milk by the mammary glands \u2014 is believed to be stimulated by prolactin, a hormone. 1 Russ, Freeman, <em>&amp; </em>McQuade, Attorneys Medical Advisor (Aug.2008) Section 4:5. During pregnancy, the level of prolactin in a woman is inhibited by high levels of estrogen and progesterone. Id. at Section 14:228. Following delivery, levels of estrogen and progesterone in the woman fall while the level of prolactin remains high. Id. at Section 14:26. Prolactin then stimulates and maintains the production of milk. Id. at Section 4:5.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">{\u00b6 37} Colostnim, a substance that contains more protein and less fat and sugar than breast milk, is secreted by the breasts during pregnancy and in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>days immediately following childbirth. Russ, Section 14:228. Milk production begins thereafter, usually on the third or fourth postpartum day, and breast milk appears. Id. at Section 14:26.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">{\u00b6 38} As the trial court found, lactation obviously is linked to breast-feeding. But given the physiological aspects of lactation, I have little trouble concluding that lactation also has a clear, undeniable nexus with pregnancy and with childbirth. Therefore, it necessarily follows that lactation is \u201cbecause of or on the basis of pregnancy\u201d and that women who are lactating are women \u201caffected by pregnancy [or] childbirth.\u201d Accord <em>Pacourek, </em>858 F.Supp. at 1402, quoting House Report (1978), No. 95-948, 95th Congress, 2d Session 5, concluding that a liberal construction of the federal PDA is proper, given its legislative history, and that \u201c \u2018the bill makes clear that its protection extends to the whole range of matters concerning the childbearing process.\u2019 \u201d Accordingly, I would hold that gender-discrimination claims arising from lactation are cognizable under Ohio\u2019s FEPA as amended by the PDA. But the analysis of this appeal does not end with that conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">{\u00b6 39} Allen\u2019s claims of discrimination appear predicated on a disparate-treatment theory. She asserts, \u201cThe workrule that [she] allegedly violated was the one that restricted the time she could pump her breast milk to her lunch break. Totes placed no such restrictions on any other employee who needed to leave his or her workstation to tend to a bodily function or bodily discomfort, only upon lactating women. The work rule was itself discriminatory, since it placed extra restrictions on women experiencing a physical act of pregnancy.\u201d The appellate court implicitly addressed that claim, holding that Allen \u201cwas simply and plainly terminated as an employee at will for taking an unauthorized, extra break (unlike the restroom breaks which were authorized and available to all of the employees, appellant included).\u201d <em>Allen, </em>Butler App. No. CA2007-08-196, 2-3.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">{\u00b6 40} In order to establish a prima facie case for disparate treatment based upon pregnancy discrimination in the workplace, the plaintiff must show that (1) she was pregnant, (2) she satisfactorily performed the duties required by the position for which she was hired, (3) she was discharged, and (4) her position was ultimately filled by an employee who was not pregnant. See <em>Donaldson v. Am. Banco Corp., Inc. </em>(D.Colo.1996), 945 F.Supp. 1456, 1463, citing <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green </em>(1973), 411 U.S. 792, 802, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668. I would find that a plaintiff may satisfy the first element of this prima facie test by showing that she was affected by pregnancy or an illness or medical condition related to pregnancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">{\u00b6 41} As with other discrimination claims, a prima facie case gives rise to a presumption of discrimination and shifts the burden of production to the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>dant to articulate a legitimate, nondiseriminatory reason for its treatment of the plaintiff. <em>St. Mary\u2019s Honor Ctr. v. Hicks </em>(1993), 509 U.S. 502, 506-507, 113 S.Ct. 2742, 125 L.Ed.2d 407. Legitimate, nondiseriminatory reasons for the action taken by the employer include insubordination on the part of the employee claiming discrimination. <em>Hood v. Diamond Prods., Inc. </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 298, 302, 658 N.E.2d 738.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">{\u00b6 42} If the defendant carries that burden of production, the presumption of discrimination drops from the case. <em>Gudenkauf v. Stauffer Communications, Inc. </em>(D.Kan.1996), 922 F.Supp. 465, 471, fn. 7. The plaintiff must then directly prove that the employer acted on a discriminatory motive or indirectly prove that the employer\u2019s reasons were a pretext for discrimination. Id. If she fails to do so, summary judgment is appropriate. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">{\u00b6 43} The undisputed evidence here is that Allen took unauthorized breaks from her work station. Isotoner asserts that it discharged her for doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">{\u00b6 44} Although Allen\u2019s unauthorized breaks may have been to pump milk, Allen could not properly engage in such actions without her employer\u2019s knowledge and permission. The FEPA and the PDA mandate that an employer treat pregnancy with neutrality, but not preferentially.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">{\u00b6 45} Allen argues that the break policy discriminates against lactating women because other employees are able to use the bathroom freely to attend to bodily functions like menstruation and urination. But Allen was not forbidden to take similar breaks, nor has she presented any evidence that any other employee routinely used the bathroom for 15-minute breaks on a scheduled basis each day. Thus, the record in this case would not support a reasonable jury\u2019s verdict in Allen\u2019s favor on a disparate-treatment theory. Summary judgment was properly entered against her.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">IY</p>\n<p id=\"b340-9\">\n<em>Pregnancy and Lactation as Disability</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b340-10\">{\u00b6 46} I turn now to the issue of whether pregnancy and lactation are disabilities for purposes of disability-discrimination analysis. I would hold that they are not.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-11\">{\u00b6 47} To establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination, the plaintiff must demonstrate (1) that she is disabled, (2) that an adverse employment action was taken by an employer, at least in part, because of the disability, and (3) that the plaintiff, though disabled, can safely and substantially perform the essential functions of the job in question. <em>Hazlett v. Martin Chevrolet, Inc. </em>(1986), 25 Ohio St.3d 279, 281, 25 OBR 331, 496 N.E.2d 478. Here, there is no showing that Allen satisfied the first prong of the test, i.e., that she was disabled by virtue of her pregnancy or lactation.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>{\u00b6 48} The courts that have considered this issue have found uniformly that pregnancy, by itself, is not a disability per se for purposes of ADA claims because \u201c[s]hort term, temporary restrictions are not substantially limiting and do not render a person disabled.\u201d <em>Kucharski v. Cort Furniture Rental </em>(D.Conn.2007), 536 F.Supp.2d 196, 202, reversed on other grounds, (D.Conn.2008), 594 F.Supp.2d 207. See also <em>Wenzlaff v. NationsBank </em>(D.Md.1996), 940 F.Supp. 889, 890; <em>Villarreal v. J.E. Merit Constructors, Inc. </em>(S.D.Tex.1995), 895 F.Supp. 149, 152. That conclusion is supported by the interpretative guidelines issued by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which state that conditions such as pregnancy are not the result of a physiological disorder and are not impairments. Id., citing 29 C.F.R. 1630.2(h). Furthermore, the ADA\u2019s express language defines a disability as a \u201cphysical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of [an] individual.\u201d Section 12102(1)(A), Title 42, U.S.Code.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> State appellate courts have reached the same conclusion, rejecting arguments that pregnancy-discrimination claims are cognizable under state laws forbidding disability discrimination. See, e.g., <em>Hegwine v. Longview Fibre Co., Inc. </em>(2007), 162 Wash.2d 340, 344, 172 P.3d 688 (\u201cAn employer who refuses to hire a job applicant because of her pregnancy is liable for sex discrimination * * *, not * * * accommodation analysis like that applicable to disability related employment discrimination claims\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">{\u00b6 49} I agree. \u201cThe implicit reasoning in these decisions is persuasive and sound. Pregnancy is a physiological condition, but not a disorder.\u201d <em>Gudenkauf, </em>922 F.Supp. at 473. Similarly, \u201c[i]t is simply preposterous to contend a woman\u2019s body is functioning abnormally because she is lactating.\u201d <em>Bond v. Sterling, Inc. </em>(N.D.N.Y.1998), 997 F.Supp. 306, 311.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">{\u00b6 50} To hold that a woman is \u201cdisabled\u201d because she is pregnant or lactating evokes the paternalistic judicial attitudes toward working women that were apparent in early twentieth century cases. See, e.g., <em>Muller v. Oregon </em>(1908), 208 U.S. 412, 422, 28 S.Ct. 324, 52 L.Ed. 551. Where, as here, there is not a medical condition related to pregnancy that would satisfy the definition of disability, I would hold that pregnancy-related discrimination claims are not cognizable under the disability-discrimination provisions in the ADA.</p>\n<judges id=\"b341-7\">Moyer, C.J., concurs in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b338-9\">. I am aware of the debates that surround breast-feeding in forums as divergent as law reviews, public health journals, and the popular press. But our role as judges is not to substitute our own views of those issues for those of the legislature as they are embodied in the Revised Code. Rather, we must follow the laws as written by the legislature and interpret them accordingly.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b341-8\">. We may look to federal regulations and ease law for guidance in interpreting comparable Ohio law. \u201cAlthough we are not bound to apply federal court interpretation of federal statutes to analogous Ohio statutes, we have looked to federal ease law when considering claims of employment discrimination brought under the Ohio Revised Code.\u201d <em>Coryell v. Bank One Trust Co. N.A., </em>101 Ohio St.3d 175, 2004-Ohio-723, 803 N.E.2d 781, \u00b6 15. See also <em>Columbus Civ. Serv. Comm. v. McGlone </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 569, 573, 697 N.E.2d 204.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-5\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b342-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>Pfeifer, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A7M\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">{\u00b6 51} This is the Supreme Court, and when the opportunity arises, we should answer the questions that Ohioans need answered. In this case, we are asked whether mothers who breast-feed can be fired from then- jobs for pumping their breasts in the workplace. That is, in its protection of pregnant workers in R.C. 4112.01(B), did the General Assembly include protection of women who are dealing with the aftereffects of their pregnancy? The lead opinion dodges the opportunity to provide an answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">{\u00b6 52} Any court\u2019s method of analyzing cases should ask (1) whether the plaintiff stated a cognizable cause of action and (2) whether the facts of the case support the alleged cause of action. It is unclear why, on this question of great general interest, this court has embarked on a backwards analysis, letting stand the appellate court\u2019s holding that LaNisa Allen was fired for leaving her post without permission rather than for pumping her breasts in the employee washroom, thus leaving unanswered the question of whether she even asserted a cognizable cause of action. The trial court proceeded properly, although its conclusion was incorrect: it found as a matter of law that Ohio\u2019s pregnancy discrimination laws do not apply to protect mothers who breast-feed their babies. It did as it should in ruling on a summary judgment motion: it gave the benefit of the facts to Allen and ruled on the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">{\u00b6 53} Somehow, the appellate court lost its way, and this court has followed. In its six-paragraph decision, the appellate court concludes that Allen was not fired for pumping her breasts: \u201cRather, she was simply and plainly terminated as an employee at will for taking an unauthorized, extra break (unlike the restroom breaks which were authorized and available to all of the employees, appellant included).\u201d <em>Allen v. totes/Isotoner Corp. </em>(Apr. 7, 2008) Butler App. No. CA200708-196. The appellate court does not explain why Allen\u2019s trips to the restroom outside scheduled break times were different from the restroom trips other employees made outside scheduled break times. There is no evidence in the record about any limit on the length of unscheduled restroom breaks and no evidence that employees had to seek permission from a supervisor to take an unscheduled restroom break. There is evidence only that unscheduled bathroom breaks were allowed and that LaNisa Allen was fired for taking them. What made her breaks different?</p>\n<p id=\"b342-8\">{\u00b6 54} We accept cases not necessarily because of how the result might affect the parties in the individual case, but because of how a holding might affect other persons similarly situated. Ohio\u2019s working mothers who endure the uncomfortable sacrifice of privacy that almost necessarily accompanies their attempt to remain on the job and nourish their children deserve to know whether Ohio\u2019s pregnancy-discrimination laws protect them.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A1_\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>Repper, Pagan, Cook, Ltd. and John H.

Hoying, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">{\u00b6 55} I would hold in this case that employment discrimination due to lactation is unlawful pursuant to R.C. 4112.01(B), that clear public policy justifies an exception to the employment-at-will doctrine for women fired for reasons relating to lactation, and that LaNisa Allen deserves the opportunity \u2014 due to the state of the record \u2014 to prove her claim before a jury.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
