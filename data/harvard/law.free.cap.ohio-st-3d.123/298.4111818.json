Bunstine of Chillicothe, Ohio, Attorney Registration No. 0030127, was admitted to the practice of law in Ohio in 1981. The Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline recommends that we suspend respondent from the practice of law for six months, staying the entire suspension on the condition of no further misconduct. The board\u2019s recommendation is based on findings that respondent, while serving as a part-time prosecutor, faded to timely recuse himself from a criminal matter involving the son of a couple who were friends of his wife. The board concluded that respondent had violated ethical standards by engaging in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice. However, given the unique circumstances at issue, we find no professional misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">{\u00b6 2} In June 2008, relator, Disciplinary Counsel, filed a complaint that alleged violations of professional misconduct stemming from a criminal matter that respondent was involved with as a prosecutor for the city of Chillicothe. He was charged with violations of DR 5-101(A)(1) (except with the consent of the client after full disclosure, a lawyer shall not accept employment if the exercise of professional judgment on behalf of the client will be or reasonably may be affected by the lawyer\u2019s financial, business, property, or personal interests) and DR 1-102(A)(5) (a lawyer shall not engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice). A panel of the board found that relator failed to establish by clear and convincing evidence that respondent had violated DR 5-101(A)(1) and recommended that that charge be dismissed. It found, however, that respondent had violated DR 1-102(A)(5). The panel recommended that respondent be suspended from the practice of law in Ohio for six months, with all six months stayed. The board adopted the panel\u2019s findings of fact, conclusions of law, and recommended sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">{\u00b6 3} The parties stipulated to several facts. Until May 2007, respondent was a part-time prosecutor for the city of Chillicothe. In 2006, respondent\u2019s wife was contacted by a couple that she knew from church. The couple indicated that their adult son had been arrested and charged with disorderly conduct and resisting arrest. At the hearing in this case, the father was asked why he and his wife had contacted respondent\u2019s wife. He testified: \u201cShe is a friend of ours, and we had never been through a court system before[;] we really didn\u2019t know how it worked[;] we were concerned about our son, and so we just wanted to get some ideas about how things would work, what we would go through, what we could do to help our son who was having some problems.\u201d The parents were concerned that their son had mental-health issues for which they hoped he would receive counseling.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">{\u00b6 4} On her own initiative, respondent\u2019s wife drafted a letter to one of the municipal court judges. The letter relayed the parents\u2019 concern that their son <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>might harm himself or others and that he would not undergo counseling unless ordered by the court to do so. The letter also mentioned past incidents reflecting on the son\u2019s mental state, which respondent\u2019s wife believed substantiated the need for counseling. The letter concluded with the typed closing \u201cEd and Lynn Bunstine,\u201d but there was no signature.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">{\u00b6 5} On the date of the defendant\u2019s arraignment, respondent gave the letter to the bailiff assigned to that courtroom and then left to attend another hearing. A notation on the letter\u2019s envelope \u2014 presumably written by the bailiff \u2014 directs that a copy be made \u201cfor all parties/attorneys.\u201d Evidence establishes that all relevant parties indeed received a copy of that letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">{\u00b6 6} At the time that the letter was delivered, no prosecutor had yet been assigned to the defendant\u2019s case. Later, however, respondent was assigned to the case. He attended two pretrials, and at the second, respondent and defense counsel negotiated a plea agreement. Under its terms, the charges against the defendant would be dismissed if he completed a 16-week counseling program.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">{\u00b6 7} After the plea agreement was accepted by the court, respondent recused himself from the case. He explained his decision this way:</p>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cWhen I spoke to [the parents] at the pretrial, and obtained their consent to this plea agreement, I told them that if they needed my help in the future, that if they continued to have problems with their son, that if their son continued to be suicidal, to feel free to give me a call at my house, and I would- help them in any way that I could in regards to the problems that they were having with their son.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-9\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cOnce I made that statement to the victims of this case [the parents], I felt that I was creating a conflict at that time. That is the reason I put on the case notes that I wanted this case reset on another prosecutor\u2019s date. Because if [the parents] had called me a week, two weeks, three weeks, four weeks down the road and said Ed, will you talk to our son, will you come out to the house and help, I would have done that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b414-10\">(\u00b6 10} Relator asserted that respondent\u2019s involvement with the letter and his failure to recuse himself earlier violated both DR 1-102(A)(5) and 5 \u2014 101(A)(1). The panel agreed only that a violation of DR 1-102(A)(5) was established and the board, in turn, adopted the panel\u2019s report in full. Respondent filed objections to the board\u2019s report. In addition to alleging some factual inaccuracies, respondent objected to the board\u2019s finding that he had violated DR 1-102(A)(5). In his argument before this court, he explained that he felt that it was his ethical duty to present to the Chillicothe Municipal Court evidence that the defendant could be a danger to himself or others. Because respondent was required to be at another hearing and could not verbally present this information to the court, he believed that the letter was a timely and effective alternative. Respondent also argued that his recusal was not untimely, because it was not warranted until his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>conversation with the defendant\u2019s parents. After that conversation, he was concerned that he had created a conflict and therefore immediately recused himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\">{\u00b6 11} In disciplinary matters, we are not bound by the conclusion of either the panel or board in determining the propriety of an attorney\u2019s conduct or the appropriate sanction. <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Furth </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 173, 181, 754 N.E.2d 219. Based on our review of the evidence before us, we adopt the board\u2019s finding that respondent did not violate DR 5-101(A)(1), and we accept its dismissal of that charge. We do not, however, adopt the board\u2019s finding that respondent\u2019s conduct violated DR 1-102(A)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">{\u00b6 12} Relator must prove by clear and convincing evidence the facts necessary to establish a violation of a Disciplinary Rule. Gov.Bar R. V(6)(J); <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Jackson </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 308, 310, 691 N.E.2d 262. \u201cClear and convincing evidence\u201d is \u201c \u2018more than a mere \u201cpreponderance of the evidence,\u201d but not to the extent of such certainty as required \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d in criminal cases, and which will produce in the mind of the trier of facts a firm belief or conviction as to the facts sought to be established.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ohio State Bar Assn. v. Reid </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 327, 331, 708 N.E.2d 193, quoting <em>Cross v. Ledford </em>(1954), 161 Ohio St. 469, 53 O.O. 361, 120 N.E.2d 118, paragraph three of the syllabus. We find that relator has not met its burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">{\u00b6 13} We hereby find that relator has not established by clear and convincing evidence that respondent violated DR 1-102(A)(5), and we dismiss that charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">Cause dismissed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b415-8\">Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b415-9\">Moyer, C.J., dissents.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b415-10\">Moyer, C.J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Aeq\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-11\">{\u00b6 14} I respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s decision that respondent did not violate DR 1-102(A)(5). Respondent took part in the prosecution of a defendant after delivering a personal letter to the presiding judge stating that respondent and his wife were friends of the defendant\u2019s parents and advocating specific action on behalf of the defendant. Although respondent\u2019s wife drafted the letter, respondent knew that it purported to be from him and his wife. After delivering the letter, respondent was assigned to prosecute the case and attended two pretrial conferences in his role as prosecutor; at the second conference, he negotiated a plea agreement with the defendant similar to the position advocated in the letter. Only after the court accepted the plea agreement did respondent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>recuse himself, claiming that it became necessary due to comments he had made to the defendant\u2019s parents at that time.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Aqz\">Jonathan E. Coughlan, Disciplinary Counsel, and Heather L. Hissom, Assistant Disciplinary Counsel, for relator.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b416-8\">Edward R. Bunstine, pro se.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">{\u00b6 15} Respondent admits in his brief: \u201cIf the letter had been sent on behalf of defendant, then I would agree with the Board and I would have recused myself.\u201d Respondent has stipulated, however, that \u201c[o]n or about August 7, 2006, Respondent\u2019s wife wrote a letter to Judge Street * * * on behalf of [the defendant].\u201d I agree that the letter was sent on behalf of the defendant, as did the board. Respondent\u2019s failure to recuse himself as soon as the case was assigned to him was a violation of DR 1 \u2014 102(A)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">{\u00b6 16} Based on respondent\u2019s misconduct and sanctions imposed in similar cases, a stayed suspension from the practice of law is the appropriate sanction. See <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. McNamee, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 269, 2008-Ohio-3883, 893 N.E.2d 490 (one-year suspension, all stayed, for representing multiple parties to a business venture in which the attorney also had an interest); <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Detty, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 57, 2002-Ohio-2992, 770 N.E.2d 1015 (six-month suspension, all stayed, for communicating with a judge in an attempt to influence litigation in which attorney did not represent a party). I would accordingly adopt the recommendation of the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline and order a six-month suspension with all six months stayed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
