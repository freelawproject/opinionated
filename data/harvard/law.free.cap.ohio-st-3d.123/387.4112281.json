The Schellings also sued the hospital for negligently granting staff privileges to Humphrey.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-13\">{\u00b6 3} After Humphrey filed a petition in bankruptcy, the Schellings dismissed their claims against him without prejudice. The hospital then moved to dismiss the negligent-credentialing claim, arguing that to prevail upon such a claim, the Schellings must first show that Loretta Schelling\u2019s injury was caused by Humphrey\u2019s negligence. The trial court granted the motion to dismiss, but the Sixth District Court of Appeals reversed. The appellate court held that the element of the doctor\u2019s negligence could be proven without the doctor being named as a party in the case. The hospital sought review in this court, and we accepted the hospital\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-14\">{\u00b6 4} Because the physician\u2019s bankruptcy filing impeded the Schellings from pursuing their claim against the physician through no fault of their own, we conclude that in the unusual circumstances of this case, the Schellings may pursue their negligent-credentialing claim against the hospital by first proving that Humphrey was negligent and that his negligence was the proximate cause of Loretta Schelling\u2019s injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">\n<em>A</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">{\u00b6 5} Loretta Schelling saw defendant Humphrey for foot pain. To address her foot pain, he performed two tarsal tunnel release surgeries on her heels, one on January 23, 2003, and the other on February 20, 2003, at defendant-appellant hospital. Schelling alleged that she has continued to experience foot pain and has suffered a permanent and partially disabling condition. The Sehellings sued Humphrey and the hospital, alleging that Loretta Schelling\u2019s ongoing foot pain was the result of complications from the two surgeries Humphrey had performed and that Humphrey had committed malpractice in those surgeries. Brent Schelling also alleged a claim of loss of consortium.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">{\u00b6 6} The Sehellings then amended their complaint to assert a negligent-credentialing claim against the Community Hospital of Williams County. The Sehellings alleged that the hospital failed to adequately review and evaluate Humphrey\u2019s education, character, and fitness to practice medicine and his past performance as a doctor and that the hospital\u2019s negligent granting of staff privileges to Humphrey caused Loretta Schelling\u2019s injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">{\u00b6 7} Humphrey and the hospital denied the allegations. The hospital moved to bifurcate the negligent-credentialing claim and the Sehellings\u2019 medical-malpractice claim against the doctor. The hospital argued that the negligent-credentialing claim did not become ripe until the doctor\u2019s negligence was determined, so the trial should be bifurcated and the negligent-credentialing claim stayed until the Sehellings obtained a finding of negligence against the doctor. The trial court granted the motion to bifurcate the trial over the Sehellings\u2019 opposition but denied the motion to stay the negligent-credentialing claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-9\">{\u00b6 8} Humphrey then filed a petition for bankruptcy. Upon receiving notice of that petition, the trial court stayed the proceedings in this case in accordance with the automatic stay of claims in a pending bankruptcy case required by Section 362(a), Title 11, U.S.Code. Thereafter, the Sehellings dismissed their action against Humphrey without prejudice on October 30, 2006. (No document reflecting the terms of any settlement of the claim against Humphrey with the bankruptcy trustee was filed in this case, although the Sehellings acknowledged that a \u201csettlement has been reached to some extent with the Bankruptcy Trustee for Dr. Humphrey.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>) The Sehellings then requested that the stay of the common pleas court action be lifted, given the dismissal of Humphrey from the case, and the trial court granted the motion. The bankruptcy court later granted Humphrey a discharge in bankruptcy. By that order, any attempt to collect a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>discharged debt from Humphrey was prohibited. See generally Section 524(a)(2), Title 11, U.S.Code. (The parties do not dispute that the discharge applied to the Schellings\u2019 claims against Humphrey.)</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">{\u00b6 9} After the stay was lifted in the trial court, the hospital moved to dismiss the negligent-credentialing claim. The hospital argued that, to its knowledge, the bankruptcy court had not found that Humphrey was negligent in his treatment of Loretta Schelling and that Humphrey had not admitted negligence, and without such a finding, the negligent-credentialing claim could not be established. The trial court granted the motion to dismiss, holding that without a finding or an admission that the doctor was negligent, the Schellings could not proceed on the negligent-credentialing claim. The Schellings appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">\n<em>B</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">{\u00b6 10} The Sixth District Court of Appeals reversed. That court concluded that the Schellings were not precluded from maintaining their negligent-credentialing claim because they could establish the element of the doctor\u2019s negligence even if the doctor was not a party to the case. <em>Schelling v. Humphrey, </em>6th Dist. No. WM-07-001, 2007-Ohio-5469, 2007 WL 2965773, \u00b6 16-17. The court of appeals rejected the hospital\u2019s argument that a finding of the doctor\u2019s negligence is a legal prerequisite to a negligent-credentialing claim. Id. at \u00b6 18. The hospital appealed to this court, and we granted review. 117 Ohio St.3d 1423, 2008-Ohio-969, 882 N.E.2d 444.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b503-10\">{\u00b6 11} The issue in this case is whether a plaintiff can proceed on a negligent-credentialing claim against a hospital without a prior finding, either by adjudication or stipulation, that the plaintiffs injury was caused by the physician\u2019s malpractice.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-11\">\n<em>A</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b503-12\">{\u00b6 12} This issue requires us to review the general principles in our cases involving the relationship between an independent doctor and the hospital when the doctor has been granted staff privileges. The parties do not dispute that Humphrey was an independent contractor, not an employee of the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-13\">{\u00b6 13} Doctors with staff privileges generally have the right to admit their own private patients to the hospital and the right to use the hospital\u2019s facilities. <em>Albain v. Flower Hosp. </em>(1990), 50 Ohio St.3d 251, 256, 553 N.E.2d 1038, fn. 5, citing Classen, Hospital Liability for Independent Contractors: Where Do We Go from Here? (1987), 40 Ark.L.Rev. 469, 478, fn. 44, overruled in part on other grounds by <em>Clark v. Southview Hosp. &amp; Family Health Ctr. </em>(1994), 68 Ohio St.3d 435, 628 N.E.2d 46. While the hospital has the power to grant and revoke staff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>privileges and establish policies and procedures regarding patient care, \u201caccredited hospitals must allow their staff physicians \u2018to provide patient care services independently within the scope of their clinical privileges.\u2019 \u201d <em>Albain, </em>50 Ohio St.3d at 256, 553 N.E.2d 1038, quoting Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospitals, Accreditation Manual for Hospitals: 1986 Edition (1985) 101.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">{\u00b6 14} Ohio law requires hospitals to set standards and procedures to be applied. See R.C. 3701.351(A). But \u201conly licensed physicians, not hospitals, are permitted to practice medicine or surgery in this state.\u201d <em>Albain, </em>50 Ohio St.3d at 259, 553 N.E.2d 1038, citing R.C. 4731.41.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">{\u00b6 15} A hospital does not need \u201cto constantly supervise and second-guess the activities of its physicians,\u201d or to \u201c \u2018pass upon the efficacy of treatment\u2019 \u201d or \u201c \u2018decide for a doctor whether an operation is necessary.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 259, 553 N.E.2d 1038, quoting <em>Hendrickson v. Hodkin </em>(1937), 250 App.Div. 619, 621, 294 N.Y.S. 982, 984-985 (Lazansky, J., dissenting), reversed (1937), 276 N.Y. 252, 11 N.E.2d 899. Nor is a hospital an insurer of the skills of the private doctors to whom it has granted staff privileges. Id. at paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">{\u00b6 16} This court\u2019s jurisprudence recognizes generally that an employer is not vicariously liable for the negligence of an independent contractor, since the employer has no right to control the mode and manner used by the independent contractor to perform the work. <em>Clark, </em>68 Ohio St.3d at 438, 628 N.E.2d 46; see also <em>Comer v. Risko, </em>106 Ohio St.3d 185, 2005-Ohio-4559, 833 N.E.2d 712, \u00b6 18. Accordingly, a hospital\u2019s mere granting of privileges to a doctor, which the hospital may later revoke under its procedures, does not permit a court to hold the hospital liable for the doctor\u2019s negligent acts under a theory of respondeat superior, or vicarious liability. <em>Albain, </em>50 Ohio St.3d 251, 553 N.E.2d 1038, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">{\u00b6 17} However, we also have held that a hospital has a direct duty to grant and continue staff privileges only to competent doctors. Id. at paragraph two of the syllabus. Thus, a hospital has a duty to remove \u201ca known incompetent.\u201d Id. at 258, 553 N.E.2d 1038.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-9\">{\u00b6 18} To prove a negligent-credentialing claim, a plaintiff injured by the negligence of a staff doctor must show that but for the lack of care in the selection or retention of the doctor, the doctor would not have been granted staff privileges, and the plaintiff would not have been injured. <em>Albain, </em>50 Ohio St.3d 251, 553 N.E.2d 1038, paragraph two of the syllabus.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b505-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>{\u00b6 19} The parties to this case do not dispute that to recover against a hospital on a negligent-credentialing claim, the plaintiff must establish the underlying medical malpractice of the doctor. The required element of the plaintiffs injury having been caused by the doctor\u2019s malpractice goes to the question of whether the <em>hospital\u2019s </em>alleged negligent credentialing of the doctor proximately caused the plaintiffs injury. \u201cAlthough medical malpractice claims against the doctor and negligent credentialing claims against the hospital are separate causes of action, * * * both causes of action fail without proof that the physician\u2019s failure to abide by ordinary standards of care proximately caused the patient\u2019s harm.\u201d <em>Browning v. Burt </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 544, 566, 613 N.E.2d 993 (Moyer, C.J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">\n<em>B</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">{\u00b6 20} The parties sharply dispute <em>when </em>a doctor\u2019s malpractice must be determined in regard to a negligent-credentialing claim. The hospital contends that the doctor must be found negligent before a negligent-credentialing claim can proceed against the hospital. The Schellings argue that the doctor\u2019s negligence may be proved in the same case and at the same time as the negligent-credentialing claim against the hospital \u2014 a case within a case. The parties also dispute whether the hospital should be required to defend against an allegation that an independent-contractor doctor committed malpractice when the doctor is not (and cannot be made) a party to the case. Compare <em>Schelling v. Humphrey, </em>6th Dist. No. WM-07-001, 2007-Ohio-5469, 2007 WL 2965773, \u00b6 18 (\u201cDetermining that staff physician negligence must be proven as an element of a negligent-credentialing claim against an employer does not interpose a legal requirement to name the staff physician as a defendant and prove the negligence claim in the same complaint\u201d) and <em>Davis v. Immediate Med. Servs., Inc. </em>(Dec. 12, 1995), 5th Dist. No. 94 CA 0253, 1995 WL 809478, *7, reversed in part on other grounds (1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 10, 684 N.E.2d 292 (finding no abuse of discretion in bifurcating the medical-malpractice issue and the negligent-credentialing issue at trial when doctors and hospital were named parties, reasoning that \u201cthe matter * * * <em>did not become ripe </em>as to the issue of negligent credentialing until and if medical negligence was found on behalf of appellee [doctor]\u201d[emphasis added]).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">{\u00b6 21} The hospital contends that the trial court properly dismissed this case on the basis that a prior finding of negligence is a legal prerequisite to maintaining a negligent-credentialing claim. The hospital relies in part on Chief Justice Moyer\u2019s partial dissent in <em>Browning, </em>66 Ohio St.3d at 566, 613 N.E.2d 993, in which he opined that <em>\u201cAlbain </em>requires that the underlying malpractice of the physician be proven before the plaintiff can recover damages against the hospital for its own negligence [in credentialing the physician].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>{\u00b6 22} But <em>Browning </em>did not address the issue we are called upon to decide in this case \u2014 whether a doctor\u2019s medical malpractice must be determined before a hospital may be called upon to defend against a negligent-credentialing claim. In <em>Browning, </em>the plaintiffs sued two doctors for medical malpractice and a hospital for the negligent credentialing of the doctors. 66 Ohio St.3d at 545, 613 N.E.2d 993. The plaintiffs obtained a default judgment \u2014 i.e., a previous finding of malpractice \u2014 against one doctor, but the other doctor remained a party. Id. at 554, 613 N.E.2d 993, fn. 10. We held that an action against a hospital for bodily injury arising out of the negligent credentialing of a doctor is subject to the two-year statute of limitations in R.C. 2305.10 rather than the one-year statute in R.C. 2305.11 that is applicable to medical-malpractice actions. Id. at paragraphs three and four of the syllabus. Chief Justice Moyer dissented in part, reasoning that \u201c[without an underlying harm to the hospital\u2019s patient through medical malpractice, an action against the hospital for negligent credentialing will never arise.\u201d Id. at 566, 613 N.E.2d 993. The Chief Justice thus opined that a negligent-credentialing claim was subject to the same one-year statute of limitations as a medical claim, not the two-year statute of limitations as a bodily-injury claim. The ruling in <em>Browning </em>regarding the statute of limitations for a negligent-credentialing claim does not answer the question of <em>when </em>a finding that a plaintiffs injury was caused by a doctor\u2019s medical malpractice must be made in regard to the negligent-credentialing claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">{\u00b6 23} Nor did <em>Browning </em>hold that a negligent-credentialing claim can be established without the doctor being a party in the case, as the court of appeals in this case determined. <em>Schelling, </em>2007-Ohio-5469, 2007 WL 2965773 at \u00b6 14. As noted above, in <em>Browning, </em>one of the doctors was still a party, and a default judgment had been issued against the other doctor on the plaintiffs\u2019 medical-malpractice claim. 66 Ohio St.3d at 554, 613 N.E.2d 993, fn. 10. Thus, <em>Browning </em>does not answer the question here \u2014 whether the Schellings can establish the independent-contractor doctor\u2019s malpractice, for the purposes of a negligent-credentialing claim, without the doctor remaining a party in the action and without a prior finding of the doctor\u2019s negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">{\u00b6 24} The hospital argues that it would be inappropriate to require hospitals to defend against a claim of an independent-contractor doctor\u2019s negligence when there has been no prior finding of malpractice and when the doctor is not a party to the case. The hospital claims that such a requirement would be inconsistent with <em>Comer </em>and <em>Albain. Comer </em>held that agency by estoppel imposes vicarious liability on a hospital only when the independent-contractor physician has been found liable. <em>Albain </em>held that a hospital may not be held vicariously liable under respondeat superior for a doctor\u2019s negligence merely because the hospital granted privileges to the doctor. But the only claim against the hospital in this case is for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>negligent credentialing, not agency by estoppel. The Schellings are not arguing that the hospital is vicariously liable for the doctor\u2019s negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">{\u00b6 25} The hospital and its amici also contend that the effect of the court of appeals\u2019 ruling, which allowed the Schellings to proceed with their negligent-credentialing claim without the physician being a named party, is to require the hospital to defend the medical-negligence claim against Humphrey even though the hospital did not direct or control his treatment of Schelling. Cf. <em>Albain, </em>50 Ohio St.3d at 259, 553 N.E.2d 1038. The hospital asserts that it is inequitable to require it to defend against Humphrey\u2019s negligence because he is no longer a party to the case and has no incentive to cooperate in the defense.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">{\u00b6 26} In a negligent-credentialing case, when the doctor is or has been amenable to suit, either the doctor ordinarily will have been found liable for medical malpractice in a prior proceeding or the claim against the doctor for medical malpractice will be joined to the claim against the hospital for negligent credentialing. Thus, the hospital would not be required to defend against a negligent-credentialing claim before the physician\u2019s malpractice has been determined, either in a prior proceeding or as the first part of the case against both the doctor and the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-9\">{\u00b6 27} The bifurcation of a negligent-credentialing claim and the underlying medical-malpractice claim avoids the problems of jury confusion or prejudice that may result from admitting evidence of prior acts of malpractice in a combined trial on both claims. Evidence of prior acts of malpractice by the doctor may be relevant to a negligent-credentialing claim, see <em>Albain, </em>50 Ohio St.3d at 258, 553 N.E.2d 1038, but presents the risk of unfair prejudice in determining whether the doctor committed malpractice, see Evid.R. 403(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-10\">{\u00b6 28} Bifurcation also allows a negligent-credentialing claim against a hospital to be dismissed if the plaintiff does not prevail on the malpractice claim against the doctor. If the fact-finder determines that negligence of the doctor was not the proximate cause of the plaintiffs injury, then a hospital\u2019s grant of staff privileges to a doctor is not the cause of the plaintiffs injury, as required by <em>Albain. </em>50 Ohio St.3d 251, 553 N.E.2d 1038, paragraph two of the syllabus (\u201ca plaintiff injured by the negligence of a staff physician must demonstrate that but for the lack of care in the selection or the retention of the physician, the physician <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>would not have been granted staff privileges, <em>and the plaintiff would not have been injured </em>\u201d [emphasis added]).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">3.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">{\u00b6 29} This case presents an unusual fact pattern in which the doctor (Humphrey) is no longer amenable to suit and the Schellings were prohibited from pursuing a claim against him shortly after they sued him, initially because of the automatic stay in place after he filed his bankruptcy petition. See Section 362(a), Title 11, U.S.Code (generally barring commencement or continuation of actions against the bankruptcy debtor). The bankruptcy court\u2019s order discharging Humphrey\u2019s debts also notified claimants that they could not attempt to collect any debts that had been discharged. The Schellings did not present any document memorializing a settlement with the bankruptcy trustee of the Schellings\u2019 malpractice claim against Humphrey, but their lawyer represented at oral argument that the trustee had paid them a percentage of the bankruptcy estate. The parties do not dispute that there was no finding in the bankruptcy proceeding that Humphrey was negligent in treating Loretta Schelling, nor did they dispute that Humphrey did not contest the Schellings\u2019 claim of medical malpractice in the bankruptcy proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">{\u00b6 30} Under the unusual circumstances of this case, where the bankruptcy proceedings impeded the Schellings from joining the physician as a party, we conclude that the Schellings should be permitted to prove that Humphrey committed medical malpractice and that the alleged malpractice caused the Schellings\u2019 injury, as an element of their negligent-credentialing claim against the hospital. We have held that a negligent-credentialing claim against a hospital is not one for vicarious (or secondary) liability for the doctor\u2019s (primary) liability for medical malpractice and that it stems from a hospital\u2019s direct duty to grant and continue staff privileges only to competent doctors. <em>Albain, </em>50 Ohio St.3d 251, 553 N.E.2d 1038, paragraphs one and two of the syllabus; <em>Browning, </em>66 Ohio St.3d at 556, 613 N.E.2d 993. Thus, Humphrey\u2019s present lack of amenability to suit does not in and of itself extinguish the Schellings\u2019 negligent-credentialing claim against the hospital. Accordingly, the Schellings should be permitted to present their claim that the hospital\u2019s alleged negligent credentialing of Humphrey caused their injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">{\u00b6 31} Consistent with our analysis in this opinion, however, bifurcating the determination of whether Humphrey committed medical malpractice and the Schellings\u2019 negligent-credentialing claim against the hospital would appropriately allow the fact-finder to determine whether Humphrey was negligent in his medical treatment of Loretta Schelling <em>before </em>the hospital must defend against the rest of the negligent-credentialing claim at trial. Only if the Schellings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>prevail on the issue of Humphrey\u2019s alleged malpractice should the rest of their negligent-credentialing claim against the hospital proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">{\u00b6 32} Accordingly, in the usual case, either a plaintiff must obtain a prior determination that a doctor committed medical malpractice and that the malpractice proximately caused the plaintiffs injury or the doctor will be a party to the case that includes the negligent-credentialing claim against the hospital. However, in the unusual circumstances of this case, Humphrey, the doctor, is no longer amenable to suit because of the bankruptcy stay and discharge, and the plaintiffs, through no fault of their own, cannot maintain their malpractice claim against him. Therefore, the Schellings are permitted to pursue their negligent-credentialing claim against the hospital, as discussed above.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">{\u00b6 33} For the reasons stated in this opinion, the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed, and the cause is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b509-9\">Moyer, C.J., and Pfeifer and O\u2019Connor, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"A-S\">Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Donnell, and Lanzinger, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b502-10\">.

I believe that the majority is making an exception to the law merely because of the \u201cunusual fact pattern\u201d of this ease, i.e., the allegedly negligent doctor is no longer amenable to suit because any debt to these plaintiffs has been discharged in bankruptcy. Consequently, the hospital is burdened with defending an allegation of negligence against a doctor who is not a hospital employee but rather is a nonparty with no stake in the outcome and no duty to cooperate or participate in the defense of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-12\">{\u00b6 35} Furthermore, the majority ordered bifurcation \u2014 a tacit acknowledgement that a finding of the doctor\u2019s negligence, or lack thereof, must be made <em>prior </em>to proceeding on the remaining elements of the negligent-credentialing claim. As a result, the hospital is forced to defend a separate, albeit related, allegation of negligence against a nonparty doctor before the negligent-credentialing claim is ripe. I believe that this outcome requires the hospital to become an insurer of the doctor, a result that is contrary to <em>Albain v. Flower Hosp. </em>(1990), 50 Ohio St.3d 251, 553 N.E.2d 1038, overruled in part on other grounds, <em>Clark v. Southview Hosp. &amp; Family Health Ctr. </em>(1994), 68 Ohio St.3d 435, 628 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>N.E.2d 46, in which we held that a hospital is not an insurer of the skills of a private physician.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AKvB\">Williams DeClark Tuschman Co., L.P.A., Chad M.

Unfortunately, he is no longer amenable to a suit because of the bankruptcy discharge. I believe that in the absence of a prior determination that he committed medical malpractice that proximately caused the plaintiffs injury, the plaintiff is unable to maintain a negligent-credentialing claim against the hospital. The unusual facts of this case do not justify creating an exception to the law for these plaintiffs and placing a burden, not authorized by law, upon the hospital to defend an action against a nonparty so that the plaintiffs may pursue their action against the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">(\u00b6 37} Consequently, I dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b510-6\">O\u2019Donnell and Lanzinger, JJ., concur in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
