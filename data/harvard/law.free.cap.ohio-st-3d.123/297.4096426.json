Mandamus will not compel the performance of an act that has already been performed. <em>State ex rel. Fontanella </em>v. <em>Kontos, </em>117 Ohio St.3d 514, 2008-Ohio-1431, 885 N.E.2d 220, \u00b6 6.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AMJ\">Lambert Dehler, pro se.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b412-9\">Richard Cordray, Attorney General, and Ashley Dawn Rutherford, Assistant Attorney General, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">{\u00b6 2} The court of appeals correctly restricted its holding to Dehler himself because Dehler did not bring his mandamus case as a class action. See <em>State ex rel. Ogan v. Teater </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 235, 247, 8 O.O.3d 217, 375 N.E.2d 1233 (\u201cWhere, as in the instant cause, the party bringing suit does not attempt to bring his cause of action within the provisions of Civ.R. 23, it is clear that the court may properly limit its holding to that of the party alone\u201d). With that restriction, Dehler was unable to establish that his mandamus claim was not moot, i.e., he failed to prove a reasonable expectation that he would be subject to the same action again. See <em>State ex rel. Cincinnati Enquirer v. </em>Heath, 121 Ohio St.3d 165, 2009-Ohio-590, 902 N.E.2d 976, \u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b412-7\">Moyek, C.J., and Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
