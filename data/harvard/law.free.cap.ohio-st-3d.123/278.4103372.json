Appellees Donald Krieger and Clifton Oliver were arrested at the stadium and were taken into police custody, along with a third person with whom they had attended the game, on suspicion of their involvement in the explosion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> While in custody, appellees suffered from poor conditions in the jail and harsh treatment by the jailers.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-12\">{\u00b6 2} Although a grand jury indicted appellees on several counts of aggravated arson and felonious assault, these charges were later dismissed by the Cuyahoga County Prosecuting Attorney. Appellees\u2019 arrests and detention adversely impacted their jobs and mental and physical health.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-13\">{\u00b6 3} Appellees successfully sued the city of Cleveland, appellant, for malicious prosecution, false arrest and imprisonment, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. The jury awarded each plaintiff $400,000 in compensatory damages and $600,000 in punitive damages. The trial court vacated the punitive-damages award as impermissible against the city. The trial court overruled the city\u2019s motion, which cited the damage caps in R.C. 2744.05(C)(1), to reduce the compensatory-damages award to $250,000 for each plaintiff. The court of appeals affirmed the award of compensatory damages, holding that R.C. 2744.05(C)(1) is unconstitutional because it violates a plaintiffs right to a jury trial and the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution. <em>Krieger v. Cleveland Indians Baseball Co., </em>176 Ohio App.3d 410, 2008-Ohio-2183, 892 N.E.2d 461, \u00b6 <em>69.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>For the reasons that follow, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and hold that R.C. 2744.05(C)(1) does not violate the constitutional right to a jury trial or the constitutional guarantees of equal protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">{\u00b6 4} R.C. 2744.05(C)(1) places a $250,000 limit on noneconomic compensatory damages (those damages that do not represent \u201cactual loss\u201d to an injured party) awarded against political subdivisions. The city of Cleveland argues that the limits should apply to reduce appellees\u2019 damage award because appellant is a political subdivision. The court of appeals did not analyze R.C. 2744.05(C)(1) but followed a previous decision of its court, <em>Gladon v. Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Auth. </em>(Mar. 10, 1994), Cuyahoga App. No. 64029, 1994 WL 78468,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in holding R.C. 2744.05(C)(1) to be unconstitutional. <em>Krieger, </em>176 Ohio App.3d 410, 2008-Ohio-2183, 892 N.E.2d 461, at \u00b6 68.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">{\u00b6 5} The court of appeals did not consider the opinion of this court in <em>Arbino v. Johnson &amp; Johnson, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 468, 2007-Ohio-6948, 880 N.E.2d 420. In <em>Arbino, </em>we reviewed a statute similar to R.C. 2744.05(C)(1) but in a different chapter of the Revised Code, R.C. 2315.18. Id. at \u00b6 4. Although the statute at issue differs from the statute in <em>Arbino </em>in that R.C. 2744.05 applies to damage awards against political subdivisions, not private litigants, the purpose and effect of the statute in <em>Arbino </em>and the statute in this case are the same \u2014 to limit compensatory-damage awards for noneconomic harm.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>{\u00b6 6} R.C. 2315.18(B) contains an exception to the limits on noneconomic damages for those persons who suffer \u201ccatastrophic injuries,\u201d see id. at \u00b6 47, but R.C. 2744.05(C) does not. We find this difference between the statutes to be no obstacle to the application of the reasoning of <em>Arbino </em>to this case. The difference has no bearing on our analysis of the effect of R.C. 2744.05 on the constitutional right to a jury trial. Nor does this difference affect our rational-basis review of the statute for equal protection purposes, for the reasons explained below. Therefore, we will apply the reasoning of <em>Arbino </em>in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">\n<em>A. Right to trial by jury</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">{\u00b6 7} In <em>Arbino, </em>we considered the effect of the damage caps on the right to a jury trial. We founded our analysis on the principle that the fact-finding of a jury is inviolate for those causes for which the right is preserved. <em>Arbino, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 468, 2007-Ohio-6948, 880 N.E.2d 420, at \u00b6 35. The right ensures that a jury\u2019s fact-finding function is not invaded, ignored, or replaced. Id. at \u00b6 37. But we noted that \u201cthe right to a trial by jury does not extend to the determination of questions of law.\u201d Id. Therefore, we reasoned that while a jury determines the amount of damages as a matter of fact, the actual award may be reduced by the application of a statute as a matter of law, akin to altering awards through remittiturs or statutory treble damages. Id. at \u00b6 38-40. Thus, in <em>Arbino, </em>we held that the statutory limit on noneconomic damages in R.C. 2315.18(B)(2) is applied as a matter of law and does not intrude upon the fact-finding function of the jury. Id. at \u00b6 40-42.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">{\u00b6 8} Accordingly, <em>Arbino </em>stands for the proposition that a court does not usurp the role of the jury in contravention of Section 5, Article I of the Ohio Constitution or the Seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution when it applies a statutory limit on noneconomic damages to the facts found by the jury. Id. This proposition is true for R.C. 2744.05(C)(1) just as it was for the statute in <em>Arbino. </em>A court does not intrude into the jury\u2019s fact-finding when applying R.C.. 2744.05; instead, the court applies the limit as a matter of law to the facts found by the jury. Therefore, the limit on noneconomic damages in R.C. 2744.05(C)(1) does not unconstitutionally restrict the right to a jury trial under Section 5, Article I of the Ohio Constitution or the Seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">\n<em>B. Equal protection</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b395-9\">{\u00b6 9} The Ohio and federal equal protection analysis applied in <em>Arbino </em>is applicable in this case as well. As in <em>Arbino, </em>there is no fundamental right or protected class at issue here, and R.C. 2744.05(C)(1) is facially neutral. 116 Ohio St.3d 468, 2007-Ohio-6948, 880 N.E.2d 420, \u00b6 64-66. Therefore, we review the statute to determine whether it has a rational basis. Id. R.C. 2744.05(C)(1) will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>pass constitutional muster under the Ohio and United States Constitutions if it is rationally related to a legitimate government purpose. Id. at \u00b6 66.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">{\u00b6 10} We have upheld a different subsection of R.C. 2744.05 under the rational-basis standard in the equal protection context. <em>Menefee v. Queen City Metro </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St.3d 27, 29, 550 N.E.2d 181. We held that the \u201cstate has a valid interest in preserving the financial soundness of its political subdivisions.\u201d Id., citing <em>Shapiro v. Thompson </em>(1969), 394 U.S. 618, 633, 89 S.Ct. 1322, 22 L.Ed.2d 600. That same state interest supports R.C. 2744.05(C). A limit on the damages for which a political subdivision may be liable is rationally related to the purpose of preserving the financial integrity of political subdivisions. Therefore, R. C. 2744.05(C)(1) is rationally related to a legitimate government interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">(\u00b6 11} Nevertheless, appellees argue that R.C. 2744.05(C)(1) should be considered unconstitutional under rational-basis review because the statute is arbitrary and unreasonable. This is so, according to appellees, because (1) the statute assigns a fixed measure of damages in all cases, thereby \u201cimpos[ing] the cost of the intended benefit to the public * * * upon those most severely injured,\u201d citing <em>Arbino, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 468, 2007-Ohio-6948, 880 N.E.2d 420, \u00b6 59, citing <em>Morris v. Savoy </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 684, 690-691, 576 N.E.2d 765, and <em>State ex rel. Ohio Academy of Trial Lawyers v. Sheward </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 451, 490, 715 N.E.2d 1062; and (2) the statute does not contain an exception for catastrophic injuries as does R.C. 2315.18(B). We find these arguments unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">(\u00b6 12} As a preliminary matter, we note that appellees are making a facial challenge to R.C. 2744.05(C)(1), because they cannot claim that the lack of a catastrophic-injury exception in the statute impacts their lawsuit. The catastrophic-injury exception in R.C. 2315.18(B)(3) is for \u201c(a) [permanent and substantial physical deformity, loss of use of a limb, or loss of a bodily organ system; [or] (b) [permanent physical functional injury that permanently prevents the injured person from being able to independently care for self and perform life-sustaining activities.\u201d We find nothing in appellees\u2019 complaint or the record that would place their injuries in these categories. Therefore, their challenge in this regard must be viewed as a facial challenge.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b396-9\">{\u00b6 13} In order for a statute to be facially unconstitutional, it must be unconstitutional in all applications. <em>Arbino, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 468, 2007-Ohio-6948, 880 N.E.2d 420, \u00b6 26, citing <em>Harrold v. Collier, </em>107 Ohio St.3d 44, 2005-Ohio-5334, 836 N.E.2d 1165, \u00b6 37, and <em>United States v. Salerno </em>(1987), 481 U.S. 739, 745, 107 S. Ct. 2095, 95 L.Ed.2d 697. In <em>Arbino, </em>the statute capped noneconomic damages for those persons who were injured but whose injuries were not so serious as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>be excluded from the caps under R.C. 2315.18(B)(3). Nevertheless, we held that the statute was neither unreasonable nor arbitrary. Id. at \u00b6 61. Similarly, the damage limits for noneconomic harm in R.C. 2744.05(C)(1) are neither unreasonable nor arbitrary, at least with regard to persons suffering noncatastrophic injuries. Therefore, the statute has at least some valid application and will survive the facial challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">{\u00b6 14} Moreover, we would not hold the statute unconstitutional if appellees had presented an as-applied challenge for arbitrariness. The eases relied upon by <em>appellees </em>\u2014 Morris, <em>Sheward, </em>and <em>Arbino </em>\u2014 are distinguishable from this case. While those cases suggest that it is arbitrary or unreasonable to impose an across-the-board limitation on noneconomic damages, those cases dealt only with lawsuits between private litigants.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">{\u00b6 15} R.C. 2744.05(C), however, applies only to damage awards against political subdivisions. We have already held that the General Assembly could have prohibited <em>all </em>tort actions against political subdivisions. <em>Menefee, </em>49 Ohio St.3d at 29, 550 N.E.2d 181. Therefore we cannot say that it is arbitrary or unreasonable for the General Assembly to allow <em>some </em>recovery in tort actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">{\u00b6 16} Accordingly, we hold that R.C. 2744.05(C)(1) does not violate the constitutional guarantee of equal protection under the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b397-9\">{\u00b6 17} We reverse the judgment of the court of appeals. The limit on noneconomic compensatory damages in R.C. 2744.05(C)(1) does not violate the right to a jury trial or the right to equal protection under the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-10\">{\u00b6 18} We are unable to apply the limit in R.C. 2744.05(C)(1) to the award based upon the record before us. Therefore, we remand the cause to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-11\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b397-12\">Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, Lanzinger, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b397-13\">Pfeifer, J., dissents.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b397-14\">O\u2019Donnell, J., dissents for the reasons stated in his dissenting opinion in <em>Arbino v.

In then memoranda to this court, appellees and them amicus have asserted that R.C. 2744.05(C)(1) is unconstitutional on due process grounds, yet this issue was not addressed by the court of appeals. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>This issue was not proposed in a proposition of law, nor have we accepted such a proposition of law. Accordingly, we decline to address the due process issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b394-9\">. Although we had accepted <em>Gladon </em>for review, we did not address the constitutionality of R.C. 2744.05(C), because we found a procedural error at trial and remanded the case, thereby avoiding an advisory opinion on the constitutional question. <em>Gladon v. Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Auth. </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 312, 662 N.E.2d 287, fn. 1.

Johnson &amp; Johnson, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 468, 2007-Ohio-6948, 880 N.E.2d 420, which also addressed whether a cap on compensatory damages violates the right to a jury trial, I dissented and wrote, \u201c \u2018So long as the trial by jury is a part of our system of jurisprudence, its constitutional integrity and importance should be jealously safeguarded. The right of trial by jury should be as inviolate in the working of our courts as it is in the wording of our Constitutions.\u2019 <em>Gibbs v. Girard </em>(1913), 88 Ohio St. 34, 47, 102 N.E. 299. Instead of jealously safeguarding the right to trial by jury, the majority opinion in this case eviscerates it by holding constitutional a statute that enables courts to \u2018enter judgments in disregard of the jury\u2019s verdict.\u2019 <em>Sorrell v. Thevenir </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 415, 422, 633 N.E.2d 504. Instead of jealously safeguarding the right to trial by jury, the majority opinion [concludes] that juries can meaningfully determine only facts that do not conflict with predetermined assessments of the General Assembly. Instead of jealously safeguarding the right to trial by jury, the majority opinion \u2018cleans the scalpel for the legislature to cut away unrestrainedly at the whole field of tort redress.\u2019 <em>Meech v. Hillhaven W., Inc. </em>(1989), 238 Mont. 21, 52, 776 P.2d 488 (Sheehy, J., dissenting).\u201d <em>Arbino </em>at \u00b6 163. Today the majority opinion allows the cutting to continue.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">{\u00b6 20} Once again, a majority of this court concludes that a statute may amend an inviolate constitutional right, even though we have previously stated that \u201c[t]he right of trial by jury, being guaranteed to all our citizens by the Constitution of the state, cannot be invaded or violated by either legislative act or judicial order or decree.\u201d <em>Gibbs, </em>88 Ohio St. 34, 102 N.E. 299, at paragraph two of the syllabus. See Section 5, Article I, Ohio Constitution (\u201cThe right of trial by jury shall be inviolate * * * \u201d). Once again, a majority of this court suggests that a cap on damages is nothing more than remittitur and ignores that \u201cthe sole reason remittitur does not violate the right to a trial by jury is that remittitur cannot be granted without the consent of the prevailing party.\u201d <em>Arbino, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 468, 2007-Ohio-6948, 880 N.E.2d 420 (Pfeifer, J., dissenting), citing <em>Wightman v. Consol. Rail Corp. </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 431, 444, 715 N.E.2d 546. Once again, a majority of this court illogically suggests that because \u201cthe treble-damages provisions of R.C. 901.51, 1331.08, 1345.09, 2307.61, 2923.34(E), and 4905.61, which increase a jury award, have never been held to infringe the right to a trial by jury, [decreasing] a jury award, \u2018cannot logically violate that right.\u2019 \u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">{\u00b6 21} And once again, I state that \u201ca statute that authorizes a judge to ignore or change factual findings deprives litigants \u2018of the benefits of Trial by Jury\u2019 and must be declared unconstitutional.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 169. R.C. 2744.05(C)(1) unconstitutionally invades the province of the jury by replacing a damages award deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>mined by a jury with a predetermined cap imposed by the General Assembly.

Instead, the majority opinion supplied its own single finding of fact and did so without commenting on the lack of legislative findings of fact or the creation of its own judicial finding of fact. Applying the equal protection analysis in the <em>Arbino </em>case to this case is unreasonable given the lack of legislative findings of fact in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">{\u00b6 23} I would affirm the judgment of the court of appeals because the caps imposed by R.C. 2744.05(C)(1) violate the right to trial by jury.
