The court of appeals concluded, based on a reasonable interpretation of its own appellate rule, Loc.App.R. 45(B)(1), that Leon failed to comply with its requirement to file an affidavit \u201cspecifying the details of the claim\u201d when he merely stated in his affidavit that his complaint was true and correct to the best of his knowledge, recollection, and belief. But cf. <em>Wellington v. Mahoning Cty. Bd. of Elections, </em>117 Ohio St.3d 143, 2008-Ohio-554, 882 N.E.2d 420, \u00b6 16-19 (court construed comparable requirement in S.Ct.Prac.R. X(4)(B) not to require repetition of statements in complaint in supporting affidavit). Notwithstanding Leon\u2019s claims to the contrary, the mere fact that he is a pro se litigant does not entitle him to ignore the requirements of the local appellate rule. \u201c <em>\u2018[P]ro se </em>litigants * * * are held to the same standard as litigants who are represented by counsel.\u2019 \u201d <em>State ex rel. Fuller v. Mengel, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 352, 2003-Ohio-6448, 800 N.E.2d 25, \u00b6 10, quoting <em>Sabouri v.
