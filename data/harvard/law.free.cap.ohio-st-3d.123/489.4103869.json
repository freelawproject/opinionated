Because the board and county commissioners failed to establish that the judge abused his discretion by ordering unreasonable and unnecessary funding, we grant the requested extraordinary relief in mandamus, but for the $109,380.20 difference between the reduced appropriation and the amount previously agreed upon by the parties in June 2009 and not the $172,860 difference the judge claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-11\">I. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b603-12\">{\u00b6 2} Relator, Charles G. Hague, is the judge of the Ashtabula County Court of Common Pleas, Probate and Juvenile Divisions. In 2008, the actual expenditures for Judge Hague totaled $1,763,597.65, with the following amounts for his specified budget categories: Juvenile Court \u2014 $266,818.70; Probate Court\u2014 $279,878.49; Juvenile Probation \u2014 $352,077.52; Youth Detention Center\u2014 $864,822.94. For 2009, Judge Hague initially requested a budget of $1,968,659.12. In November 2008, respondent Ashtabula County Board of Commissioners conducted a hearing on Judge Hague\u2019s 2009 budget request at which it advised him that due to a decrease in county revenues, all county departments had to incur significant budget cuts in 2009. In December 2008 and June 2009, Judge Hague decreased the amount of his budget request, ultimately to $1,765,141, which barely exceeded the $1,763,597.65 actually spent in 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-13\">{\u00b6 3} By letter dated June 11, 2009, the board of commissioners offered to provide a total appropriation for the courts in 2009 of $1,665,121, to be distributed as follows: Probate Court \u2014 $255,698; Juvenile Court \u2014 $248,755; Juvenile Probation \u2014 $329,168; Youth Detention Center' \u2014 $831,500. Judge Hague accepted the board\u2019s offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>{\u00b6 4} Six weeks later, in July 2009, the Ashtabula County Budget Commission issued a revised certificate of estimated resources and reduced the amount of resources available for appropriations. According to Judge Hague, the board of commissioners unilaterally lowered the courts\u2019 2009 appropriation by over ten percent, i.e., $172,860, from the sum agreed upon by the parties a few weeks before. On August 13, 2009, the board of commissioners further amended the appropriation to provide a total of $1,555,740.80 to Judge Hague, with the following amounts appropriated for the judge\u2019s budget categories: Probate Court \u2014 $230,128.20; Juvenile Court \u2014 $223,897.50; Juvenile Probation\u2014 $296,251.20; Youth Detention Center \u2014 $805,463.90. When compared to 2008 actual expenditures, this represented a decrease of about 16 percent for Judge Hague\u2019s juvenile court and juvenile probation budget categories and nearly 18 percent for the probate court. The board\u2019s reduced appropriation to Judge Hague is $109,380.20 less than the $1,665,121 amount previously agreed to by the parties in June.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">{\u00b6 5} On August 27, 2009, Judge Hague issued probate and juvenile court orders requiring the board of commissioners to appropriate the reasonable and necessary funds for the courts in the amount of the parties\u2019 June 2009 agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">{\u00b6 6} As a result of the reduced 2009 appropriation, the administration of justice of the probate and juvenile courts has been adversely affected. For example, on October 2, 2009, Judge Hague was forced to close the county\u2019s youth detention facility. The facility had originally been built in the early 1990s, when the board of commissioners and the juvenile court agreed that housing and treating Ashtabula County children in a local setting was the most effective form of treatment. No facility in any adjoining county is available to take Ashtabula County juveniles, and the lack of a county detention center severely restricts the juvenile court\u2019s ability to function. That is, it is now impossible to execute warrants for juvenile offenders, and the court\u2019s ability to enforce its own orders is severely hampered. In sum, the juvenile court cannot discharge its constitutional and statutory duties without the local detention facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-8\">{\u00b6 7} The reduced appropriation forced Judge Hague to close either the youth detention center or the clerk\u2019s offices for the probate and juvenile courts. The continued operation of the detention center required 22 employees and the previously agreed sum of nearly $831,500 for 2009, which was based in part on the staffing requirements of Ohio Adm.Code 5139 \u2014 37\u201411(A)(6) (specifying certain personnel requirements for juvenile detention centers). After Judge Hague opted to close the detention center rather than the courts\u2019 clerk\u2019s offices, 20 detention center employees were laid off, and the remaining two employees were retained to perform maintenance work at the facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>{\u00b6 8} Due to the board\u2019s reduced funding of the juvenile court, Judge Hague also laid off a part-time magistrate and placed a deputy clerk, a court reporter, and a security officer on 32-hour workweeks, with the rest of the court staff having to adjust their schedules and workloads to compensate for the lost and reduced positions. This has resulted in the juvenile court\u2019s (1) inability to meet time limits in certain cases, (2) inability to supervise probation cases, (3) delay in the processing of filings, (4) potential loss of federal funds, and (5) reduction in the amount of revenue generated for the county through fines and court costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">{\u00b6 9} Because of the board\u2019s reduction in the funding of the probate court, the court has lost two of its five clerks, one of whom retired and was not replaced, leaving a smaller staff than the court had in 1968 and severely curtailing its efficient operation. This has resulted in the probate court\u2019s being up to six weeks behind in opening new cases, holding inventory hearings, and issuing publications, which means lost revenue for the county, and the court\u2019s ability to timely process certain orders has been compromised. In addition, with fewer court personnel to schedule and hear emergency cases, senior citizens and mentally ill adults are being placed at greater risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">{\u00b6 10} On September 2, Judge Hague filed this action for a writ of mandamus to compel respondents, the board and its individual commissioners, to appropriate the sum ordered by him for the reasonable and necessary funding for the probate and juvenile courts. We granted an alternative writ and issued an accelerated schedule for the submission of evidence and briefs. <em>State ex rel. Hague v. Ashtabula Cty. Bd. of Commrs., </em>123 Ohio St.3d 1412, 2009-Ohio-5288, 914 N.E.2d 409. The parties submitted their evidence and briefs, and we ordered the parties to submit additional evidence on certain matters. <em>State ex rel. Hague v. Ashtabula Cty. Bd. of Commrs., </em>123 Ohio St.3d 1485, 2009-Ohio-5935, 916 N.E.2d 482.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">{\u00b6 11} This cause is now before us for our consideration of the merits. We do not address the merits of Judge Hague\u2019s motion for a protective order, because it is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">II. Legal Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b605-9\">\n<em>Mandamus: General Standards for Funding Orders</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b605-10\">{\u00b6 12} Judge Hague requests a writ of mandamus to compel the board and its commissioners to comply with his funding orders for the probate and juvenile courts for 2009. In resolving this claim, we are guided by the general standards set forth in <em>State ex rel. Maloney v. Sherlock, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 77, 2003-Ohio-5058, 796 N.E.2d 897, \u00b6 25-26:</p>\n<p id=\"b605-11\">{\u00b6 13} \u201c \u2018It is well settled that mandamus is an appropriate vehicle for enforcing a court\u2019s funding order.\u2019 <em>State ex rel. Donaldson v. Alfred </em>(1993), 66 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>Ohio St.3d 327, 329, 612 N.E.2d 717. Common pleas courts and their divisions have inherent power to order funding that is reasonable and necessary to the courts\u2019 administration of their business. <em>State ex rel. Morley v. Lordi </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 510, 511, 651 N.E.2d 937 (probate court); <em>State ex rel. Lake Cty. Bd. of Commrs. v. Hoose </em>(1991), 58 Ohio St.3d 220, 221, 569 N.E.2d 1046 (juvenile court). \u2018In turn, the board of county commissioners is obligated to appropriate the requested funds, unless the board can establish that the court abused its discretion by requesting unreasonable and unnecessary funding.\u2019 <em>State ex rel. Wilke v. Hamilton Cty. Bd. of Commrs. </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 55, 60, 734 N.E.2d 811; <em>State ex rel. Avellone v. Lake Cty. Bd. of Commrs. </em>(1989), 45 Ohio St.3d 58, 61, 543 N.E.2d 478.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cIn effect, the court\u2019s funding orders are presumed reasonable, and the board must rebut the presumption in order to justify its noncompliance with these orders. <em>State ex rel. Weaver v. Lake Cty. Bd. of Commrs. </em>(1991), 62 Ohio St.3d 204, 205, 580 N.E.2d 1090. \u2018This presumption emanates from the separation-of-powers doctrine because courts must be free from excessive control by other governmental branches to ensure their independence and autonomy.\u2019 <em>Wilke, </em>90 Ohio St.3d at 60-61, 734 N.E.2d 811.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">{\u00b6 15} With these standards framing our analysis, the merits of Judge Hague\u2019s mandamus claim are next addressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">\n<em>Reasonableness of Funding Orders</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b606-8\">{\u00b6 16} In trying to meet their burden to rebut the presumed reasonableness of Judge Hague\u2019s funding orders for the probate and juvenile courts for 2009, the board and commissioners assert that the judge abused his discretion by issuing his funding orders for the appropriations cut by the board of commissioners from the budget that the parties had previously agreed to in June 2009. Absent an abuse of discretion on the part of Judge Hague, \u201cthe Board of County Commissioners is obligated to appropriate annually such sum of money as will meet all the administrative expenses of such court which the judge thereof deems necessary.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Ray v. South </em>(1964), 176 Ohio St. 241, 27 O.O.2d 133, 198 N.E.2d 919, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-9\">{\u00b6 17} The reasonableness of a court\u2019s funding request \u201cmust be determined \u2018only from a consideration of the request in relation to the factual needs of the court for the proper administration of its business.\u2019 \u201d <em>State ex rel. Milligan v. Freeman </em>(1972), 31 Ohio St.2d 13, 18, 60 O.O.2d 7, 285 N.E.2d 352, quoting <em>State ex rel. Moorehead v. Reed </em>(1964), 177 Ohio St. 4, 5, 28 O.O.2d 409, 201 N.E.2d 594. The board and commissioners cannot simply substitute their judgment for that of Judge Hague in these matters. <em>State ex rel. Wilke v. Hamilton Cty. Bd. of Commrs., </em>90 Ohio St.3d 55, 61, 734 N.E.2d 811, citing <em>State ex rel. Foster v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number><em>Wittenberg </em>(1968), 16 Ohio St.2d 89, 45 O.O.2d 442, 242 N.E.2d 884, paragraph three of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">{\u00b6 18} The board and commissioners claim that they have rebutted the presumed reasonableness of the requesting funding because Judge Hague failed to make sufficient operational changes to reduce the courts\u2019 budget, failed to cooperate with the budget process in a timely manner, and has sufficient money to operate the courts for the remainder of 2009. These claims lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">{\u00b6 19} For the board\u2019s claim that the judge failed to timely pursue various alternatives for reducing costs, Judge Hague submitted evidence that the majority of juveniles appearing before the juvenile court are indigent and that an increase in court fees and costs would simply increase unpaid sums instead of increasing county revenue.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">{\u00b620} In addition, the board\u2019s funding reduction for the courts decreased county revenues because of fewer court staff to timely process and resolve cases. Any further reduction in court staff would likely result in additional delay in the courts\u2019 timely resolution of cases as well as an additional reduction in revenue generated by the cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-8\">{\u00b6 21} Judge Hague also did not abuse his discretion in using his special-projects fund, which has no impact on the county\u2019s general fund, to pay for the reasonable and necessary expenses of the judge and court personnel to attend conferences at which probate and juvenile court problems are discussed. See, e.g., R.C. 2151.10 (authorizing juvenile court judge to include in court\u2019s budget \u201creasonably necessary expenses of the judge and such officers and employees as the judge may designate in attending conferences at which juvenile or welfare problems are discussed\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-9\">{\u00b6 22} Notably, the board and commissioners fail to specify any reasonable alternative for Judge Hague to reduce costs for the probate and juvenile courts that would not have been harmful to the courts\u2019 efficient operation. Moreover, Judge Hague timely investigated whether neighboring counties\u2019 youth detention facilities would take Ashtabula County juveniles.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-10\">{\u00b6 23} Furthermore, Judge Hague cooperated with the county\u2019s budget process by reducing his initial budget request for 2009, participating in the board\u2019s budget hearing, and eventually agreeing to the board\u2019s June 2009 offer to appropriate $1,665,121 for the courts. To be sure, \u201c <em>\u2018a </em>reasonably exercised spirit of mutual cooperation among the branches of government is essential.\u2019 \u201d <em>State ex rel. Morgan v. Strickland, </em>121 Ohio St.3d 600, 2009-Ohio-1901, 906 N.E.2d 1105, \u00b6 19, quoting <em>State ex rel. Johnston v. Taulbee </em>(1981), 66 Ohio St.2d 417, 420, 20 O.O.3d 361, 423 N.E.2d 80. That is, \u201ccourts should cooperate with the executive and legislative bodies in the budget process.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Mahoning Cty. Commrs. v. Maloney, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 248, 2003-Ohio-5770, 797 N.E.2d 1284, \u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>{\u00b6 24} But \u201c \u2018such voluntary co-operation should not be mistaken for a surrender or diminution of the plenary power to administer justice which is inherent in every court whose jurisdiction derives from the Ohio Constitution.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wilke, </em>90 Ohio St.3d at 63, 734 N.E.2d 811, quoting <em>State ex rel. Giuliani v. Perk </em>(1968), 14 Ohio St.2d 235, 237, 43 O.O.2d 366, 237 N.E.2d 397. In essence, Judge Hague was not required to agree to funding that was insufficient to cover the reasonable and necessary expenses of the probate and juvenile courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">{\u00b6 25} In a similar vein, the board and commissioners\u2019 reliance on evidence that other county departments did not complain about their reduced funding does not mean that Judge Hague\u2019s funding orders were unreasonable. The board and commissioners cite seven different county departments that they claim received greater or similar cuts to their 2009 budgets. But they fail to note that at least 14 other departments received increases in their 2009 budgets or decreased funding in amounts lower than Judge Hague\u2019s budget categories for the probate and juvenile courts and juvenile probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">{\u00b6 26} Finally, the board and its commissioners claim that they have rebutted the presumption that Judge Hague\u2019s funding orders are reasonable and necessary because the judge still has sufficient funds left from the reduced 2009 appropriation because the \u201cmajority of * * * expenses [were] already paid, [so that] Judge Hague could operate within the remaining * * * appropriations in the last 3.5 months of 2009.\u201d The judge\u2019s supplemental evidence, however, establishes otherwise. The board\u2019s reduced appropriation of the courts\u2019 budget left Judge Hague with the dilemma of closing either the detention center or the clerk\u2019s offices of the probate and juvenile courts. The board and commissioners thus failed to submit sufficient evidence to counter the presumption that the ordered funds are reasonable and necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">{\u00b6 27} Even if Judge Hague has sufficient funds to operate the probate and juvenile courts for the rest of 2009, the judge\u2019s evidence refutes any argument that the courts had sufficient funds to operate in an efficient and constitutionally and statutorily required manner for the remainder of the year. To the contrary, the judge\u2019s evidence established that the timely processing of cases was being unduly delayed by the reduced funding, resulting in further decreased county revenue, and that the forced closure of the detention center left the county without an essential element of the juvenile justice system.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-8\">{\u00b6 28} In fact, the judge has submitted evidence that establishes that the requested funds are reasonable based on the factual needs of the courts for the proper administration of their business. <em>Milligan, </em>31 Ohio St.2d at 18, 60 O.O.2d 7, 285 N.E.2d 352. First, the funding orders reflected the sum agreed to by the board and commissioners only weeks before the board\u2019s unilateral reduction of the courts\u2019 funding. Second, Judge Hague submitted specific evidence that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>reduced funding impaired the efficient continued operation of the probate and juvenile courts, which delayed the timely hearing of cases in both courts and diminished the potential revenue generated by the cases. Third, as established by the additional evidence submitted by Judge Hague, the board\u2019s reduced funding resulted in the closure of the county\u2019s youth detention center, which limited the juvenile court\u2019s dispositional alternatives for delinquent children. See R.C. 2152.26 and Juv.R. 7. In fact, R.C. 2151.10 specifies that a juvenile court\u2019s written request for an appropriation for the reasonable and necessary expenses of the court include expenses for the \u201cmaintenance and operation of the detention facility.\u201d See also <em>State ex rel. Clarke v. Lawrence Cty. Bd. of Commrs. </em>(1943), 141 Ohio St. 16, 19, 25 O.O. 134, 46 N.E.2d 410 (\u201cIf a Juvenile Court is handicapped in its operation by a lack of funds and personnel, society may be the loser\u201d). Finally, the board\u2019s own study of 12 Ohio counties indicated that for 2007 and 2008, although Ashtabula County had the ninth largest population of the 12 counties, its juvenile court budget was the lowest.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">{\u00b629} Therefore, the board and commissioners have failed to rebut the presumed reasonableness of Judge Hague\u2019s funding orders. None of the board and commissioners\u2019 contentions credibly accounts for the courts\u2019 demonstrated needs for their proper administration.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">\n<em>Undue Hardship</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">{\u00b6 30} The board and commissioners\u2019 remaining claim is that the requested extraordinary relief in mandamus should be denied because, due to the county\u2019s severe financial condition, complying with Judge Hague\u2019s funding orders would impose an undue hardship on other county offices.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-8\">{\u00b6 31} Because the board and commissioners have failed to rebut the presumed reasonableness of the probate and juvenile court funding orders, their sole claim is government hardship. But \u201cgovernment hardship is insufficient by itself to establish an abuse of discretion in determining the required amount of court funding.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Maloney v. Sherlock, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 77, 2003-Ohio-5058, 796 N.E.2d 897, \u00b6 43; <em>State ex rel. Britt v. Franklin Cty. Bd. of Commrs. </em>(1985), 18 Ohio St.3d 1, 3-4, 18 OBR 1, 480 N.E.2d 77; <em>State ex rel. Weaver v. Lake Cty. Bd. of Commrs. </em>(1991), 62 Ohio St.3d at 206-207, 580 N.E.2d 1090.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-9\">{\u00b6 32} Moreover, the board and commissioners concede that there are sufficient funds available from the county\u2019s unencumbered cash balance to cover the additional $109,380.20 unilaterally cut from the courts\u2019 2009 budget, as previously agreed to by the board. One of the county\u2019s early October budget projections indicated a carryover balance from 2009 to 2010 of over $1.3 minion, and the supplemental evidence refers to an estimated carryover balance of over $840,000. Either estimated amount would be sufficient to cover the reasonable and neces<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>sary sum of Judge Hague\u2019s funding orders for the probate and juvenile courts for the remainder of 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">{\u00b6 33} The board and commissioners\u2019 duty to appropriate the ordered amounts is not \u201cvitiated by the fact that compliance with the court\u2019s requests would work an undue hardship on other offices and agencies.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Maloney v. Sherlock, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 77, 2003-Ohio-5058, 796 N.E.2d 897, \u00b6 47; <em>Weaver, </em>62 Ohio St.3d at 208, 580 N.E.2d 1090; <em>Moorehead, </em>177 Ohio St. at 6, 28 O.O.2d 409, 201 N.E.2d 594. Their evidence concerning declining annual carryover balances and the importance of these balances, while relevant, does not excuse them from complying with the judge\u2019s reasonable funding orders. <em>Weaver, </em>62 Ohio St.3d at 206-207, 580 N.E.2d 1090 (board of county commissioners\u2019 evidence about county\u2019s decreased personal-property-tax revenues, declining annual carryover balances, and insufficient resources to fund appropriation requests held to be insufficient to establish abuse of discretion in juvenile court judge\u2019s determination of amount of required court funding). Therefore, the commissioners have not rebutted the presumption that the probate and juvenile court budget orders are reasonable and necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">\n<em>Reasonableness of Appropriation Requests Determined as of Time Submitted</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">{\u00b6 34} Our precedent requires evaluation of the propriety of the court\u2019s funding request as of the time the judge makes it. See <em>State ex rel. Maloney v. Sherlock, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 77, 2003-Ohio-5058, 796 N.E.2d 897, \u00b6 46. Because we find that the board and commissioners had a duty to appropriate the requested funds to Judge Hague when he issued the funding orders, their duty to do so has not dissipated with the passage of time. Any savings from the reduced court operations had not occurred at the time that Judge Hague issued his funding orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-8\">{\u00b6 35} In addition, any savings were obtained by detriment to the court\u2019s efficient operation and by the closure of the detention center and therefore cannot be used to diminish the reasonable and necessary funding ordered by Judge Hague to operate the probate and juvenile courts. A contrary holding would, in essence, reward a funding authority for failing to timely appropriate the reasonable and necessary amount ordered by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-9\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b610-10\">{\u00b6 36} The evidence does not establish that Judge Hague acted in an unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable manner by ordering the board of commissioners to appropriate the funds requested. Although the commissioners claim that they accorded the probate and juvenile courts budgetary priority, their actual appropriations indicate that many county departments and offices fared better in the board\u2019s 2009 appropriations. In effect, the appropriations were \u201cbased on an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>arbitrary determination rather than any analysis of the needs and programs of the courts.\u201d <em>State ex rel.

But \u201c[w]hile we appreciate the dilemma that the commissioners encounter in promulgating a budget during difficult economic times, we are compelled to remind the commissioners that the courts must not be held hostage to competing interests when the courts, in their discretionary power, submit budgetary requests that are reasonable and necessary.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Rudes v. Rofkar </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 69, 72, 15 OBR 163, 472 N.E.2d 354, overruled in part on other grounds, <em>Weaver, </em>62 Ohio St.3d at 207-208, 580 N.E.2d 1090. Judge Hague submitted reasonable and necessary funding orders. Although the board reduced the courts\u2019 budget $109,380.20 from the amount in the June 2009 agreement, which the board and commissioners had previously assented to, he is entitled to a writ of mandamus to compel them to appropriate the additional funding in the amount of $109,380.20 for 2009 forthwith. Insofar as Judge Hague requests $172,860 instead, that figure is incorrect and does not account for the board\u2019s amended August appropriation. The $109,380.20 amount will permit Judge Hague to restore the courts to the funding level that will allow the detention center to immediately reopen and the probate and juvenile courts to operate in an efficient manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">Writ granted.</p>\n<judges id=\"b611-8\">Moyer, C.J., and Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b611-9\">Pfeifer, J., concurs in judgment only.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
