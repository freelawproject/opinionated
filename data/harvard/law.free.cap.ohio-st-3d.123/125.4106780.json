White v. Bechtel, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 11, 2003-Ohio-2262, 788 N.E.2d 634, \u00b6 5; <em>State ex rel. Manns v. Henson, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 348, 2008-Ohio-4478, 894 N.E.2d 47, \u00b6 4. R.C. 2969.25(C)(1) required Swain, who filed a declaration of indigency in which he claimed an inability to pay the costs and fees associated with his mandamus case, to file a statement setting forth his inmate account \u201cfor each of the preceding six months, as certified by the institutional cashier.\u201d He did not do so, and his claims on appeal concerning the inapplicability of R.C. 2969.25(A) are insufficient to justify reversal of a judgment that was properly premised in part on R.C. 2969.25(C)(1). We will not reverse a correct judgment simply because some or all of a lower court\u2019s reasons are erroneous. <em>State ex rel. Deiter v.
