Grissom v. McGookey, </em>108 Ohio St.3d 491, 2006-Ohio-1506, 844 N.E.2d 841, \u00b64. R.C. 2969.25(A) requires that \u201c[a]t the time that an inmate commences a civil action or appeal against a government entity or employee, the inmate shall file with the court an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>affidavit that contains a description of each civil action or appeal of a civil action that the inmate has filed in the previous five years in any state or federal court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\">{\u00b6 3} To determine the legislative intent behind this provision, we \u201cread words and phrases in context and construe them in accordance with rules of grammar and common usage.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Russell v. Thornton, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 409, 2006-Ohio-5858, 856 N.E.2d 966, \u00b6 11. The plain language of the statute includes no requirement that inmates who have not filed a civil action or appeal of a civil action against a government entity or employee in the requisite five-year period file this affidavit. We cannot add a requirement that does not exist in the statute. See <em>State ex rel. Lorain v. Stewart, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 222, 2008-Ohio-4062, 893 N.E.2d 184, \u00b6 36, and cases cited therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">{\u00b6 4} Previous holdings imply this interpretation of R.C. 2969.25(A). See <em>State ex rel. Kimbro v. Glavas, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 197, 2002-Ohio-5808, 777 N.E.2d 257, \u00b6 3 (inmate relator \u201cfails to assert that he has not filed any civil actions in the previous five years or that R.C. 2969.25(A) is otherwise inapplicable\u201d). In addition, courts of appeals have expressly held that R.C. 2969.25(A) is not violated under these circumstances. <em>Hill v. Ohio Adult Parole Auth., </em>Franklin App. No. 05AP-1086, 2006-Ohio-1299, 2006 WL 701126, \u00b6 6 (\u201cif an inmate has not filed any civil actions in the previous five years, R.C. 2969.25(A) does not require him to file an affidavit\u201d); <em>Rushing v. Haskins </em>(1999), Noble App. No. 255, 1999 WL 61043, *2 (R.C. 2969.25(A) \u201cdoes not specifically require an inmate to file an affidavit stating that he has <em>not </em>filed any civil actions within the last five years\u201d [emphasis sic]). Notably, the record contains no evidence \u2014 and appellee does not claim \u2014 that Wickensimer filed any specified action within the five-year period before he filed his mandamus action.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">{\u00b6 5} Finally, appellee\u2019s reliance on <em>Church v. Ohio Dept. of Rehab. &amp; Corr. </em>(June 15, 1999), Franklin App. No. 98AP-1222, 1999 WL 394891, is misplaced. In <em>Church, </em>the court of appeals held that although no affidavit was required by R.C. 2969.25(A), \u201ca written statement affirming that no prior actions subject to disclosure exist <em>should </em>in fact be filed.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id. at *5; <em>Hill, </em>at \u00b6 6. But the court of appeals in <em>Church </em>and <em>Hill </em>did not suggest that this \u201cstatement\u201d was <em>required </em>by R.C. 2969.25(A); it merely held that such a statement <em>should </em>be filed. Again, nothing in the plain statutory language requires such a statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">{\u00b6 6} Therefore, the court of appeals erred in dismissing Wickensimer\u2019s mandamus petition based on noncompliance with R.C. 2969.25(A). The judgment is thus reversed, and the cause is remanded for further proceedings on the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"ADLf\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>Brian Wickensimer, pro se.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b270-5\">Richard Cordray, Attorney General, and Melissa Montgomery, Assistant Attorney General, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<judges id=\"b270-3\">Moyer, C.J., and Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
