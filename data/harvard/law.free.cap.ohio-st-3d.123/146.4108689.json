Dunn-Brock (\u201cclaimants\u201d) were carryover employees of the Lucas County MRDD while employed with Community Living Options, Inc. (\u201cCLO\u201d), a nonprofit corporation, and to enter a decision that the claimants were not carryover employees while employed at CLO and thus were not entitled to public-employee service credit for that employment. Because the retirement board did not abuse its discretion in so deciding, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals denying the writ of mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">Creation and Implementation of Supported-Living Services</p>\n<p id=\"b261-9\">{\u00b6 2} \u201cSupported living\u201d includes services provided to mentally retarded and developmentally disabled individuals to enable them to live in a residence of their choice. R.C. 5126.01(U)(1)(a). Before the 1989 enactment of Am.Sub.H.B. No. 257, 143 Ohio Laws, Part III, 3855, Lucas County MRDD had not provided supported-living services to mentally retarded and developmentally disabled individuals in Lucas County. Lucas County MRDD had previously provided residential services only to qualifying individuals residing in group homes. Under the amendment, county boards of mental retardation and developmental disabilities were required to select county residents for which supported living was to be provided and to identify these residents\u2019 individual service needs. R.C. 5126.41, formerly R.C. 5126.45. County boards were authorized to enter into contracts with other boards and entities, including private, nonprofit corporations, to provide the required services. R.C. 5126.05(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-10\">{\u00b6 3} In October 1989, the Lucas County MRDD accepted an appropriation from the Ohio Department of Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities for the specific purpose of planning, developing, and implementing supported-living services. The Lucas County MRDD specified that its intent in accepting the appropriation was to assume all incumbent responsibilities in accordance with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>R.C. 5126.40 to 5126.47 \u201cfor the coordination and management of supported living services.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">{\u00b6 4} Lucas County MRDD subsequently created CLO, a nonprofit corporation, with the intent to transfer administration of the supported-living program from the board to the corporation. CLO was incorporated in December 1990. In March 1991, Lucas County MRDD entered into a contract with CLO in which CLO would operate specified functions of the board\u2019s supported-living program, including the selection of supported-living providers, the development, negotiation, monitoring, and auditing of supported-living contracts, the development of generic and nonpaid services and support, and assistance with ongoing needs assessments.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">{\u00b6 5} In the interim between Lucas County MRDD\u2019s acceptance of the state appropriation to provide supported-living services and its contract with CLO for the administration of the services by the nonprofit corporation, Lucas County MRDD provided supported-living services.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">Claimants\u2019 Employment with Lucas County MRDD and with CLO</p>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">{\u00b6 6} The claimants, Anita Allen, Monica Armstrong, and Mary C. Dunn-Brock, worked initially as case managers for Lucas County MRDD. Allen later became a habilitation coordinator for the board. The claimants resigned their positions with Lucas County MRDD and began working for CLO as quality-assurance coordinators and specialists.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-9\">Retirement-System Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b262-10\">{\u00b6 7} In 2004, the Ohio Public Employee Retirement System (\u201cPERS\u201d) issued staff determinations finding that claimants were carryover public employees while employed by CLO. Lucas County appealed, and in 2006, the retirement system\u2019s general counsel issued a senior-staff membership determination upholding the previous PERS staff decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-11\">{\u00b6 8} On further appeal by the county to the retirement board pursuant to Ohio Adm.Code 145-1-11, a PERS hearing examiner held a hearing. At the hearing, claimant Anita Allen testified that the duties performed by the claimants with Lucas County MRDD before they resigned were the same as or similar to the duties they performed with CLO. Whether they were employed as a case manager or a habilitation coordinator at Lucas County MRDD, or as a quality-assurance coordinator or specialist at CLO, the claimants assessed and monitored the needs of mentally retarded and developmentally disabled clients. Lori Stanfa, the first executive director of CLO, testified that when CLO first began operations, the Lucas County MRDD case managers initially assisted in developing the plans for supported-living clients until CLO \u201ctook over that function later.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>{\u00b6 9} The hearing examiner issued a comprehensive report in which he recommended that the retirement board uphold the PERS senior-staff determination that claimants were carryover employees \u2014 and were therefore entitled to PERS service credit \u2014 when they worked for CLO. In his report, the hearing examiner found that the \u201ccounty\u2019s case managers and habilitation coordinators who became CLO quality assurance specialists and coordinators continued * * * to perform the core function of providing housing and habilitation resources to persons with mental retardation and developmental disabilities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">{\u00b6 10} In February 2007, the retirement board accepted the hearing examiner\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law and found that claimants were public employees while employed with CLO and were thus eligible for PERS service credit as carryover employees for these periods.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">Mandamus Case</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">{\u00b6 11} Lucas County MRDD filed an action in the Court of Appeals for Franklin County challenging the retirement board\u2019s decision. In a subsequent amended complaint, Lucas County MRDD requested a writ of mandamus to compel the retirement board to vacate its decision that the claimants were carryover public employees while employed with CLO and to enter a decision that the county board was not liable for PERS contributions for the claimants\u2019 CLO employment. The retirement board submitted a certified record of the PERS administrative proceedings, and the parties filed briefs on the merits of the mandamus claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">{\u00b6 12} A court of appeals magistrate issued a decision recommending that the court deny the requested writ of mandamus. In November 2008, the court of appeals overruled Lucas County MRDD\u2019s objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision and denied the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-9\">{\u00b6 13} This cause is now before the court upon Lucas County MRDD\u2019s appeal as of right from the judgment denying the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-10\">Mandamus to Remedy Abuse of Discretion by Retirement Board</p>\n<p id=\"b263-11\">{\u00b6 14} For the standard of review, Lucas County MRDD initially claims that the court should treat the court of appeals\u2019 judgment as a summary judgment because the court of appeals, \u201cby dismissing Appellant\u2019s Complaint for Writ of Mandamus essentially granted Appellees a motion for summary judgment.\u201d This contention lacks merit. The court of appeals did not dismiss the mandamus action or grant summary judgment; instead, the court denied the writ based on the merits as presented by the administrative record and the parties\u2019 briefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-12\">{\u00b6 15} Lucas County MRDD seeks a writ of mandamus to compel the retirement board to vacate its decision to award PERS service credit to claimants for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>the time that they were employed by CLO. \u201c[M]andamus is an appropriate remedy where no statutory right of appeal is available to correct an abuse of discretion by an administrative body.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Pipoly v. State Teachers Retirement Sys., </em>95 Ohio St.3d 327, 2002-Ohio-2219, 767 N.E.2d 719, \u00b6 14. In the absence of a statutory right to appeal the. retirement board\u2019s determination of PERS service credit, mandamus is an appropriate remedy. <em>State ex rel. Schachter v. Ohio Pub. Emps. Retirement Bd., 121 </em>Ohio St.3d 526, 2009-Ohio-1704, 905 N.E.2d 1210, \u00b6 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">{\u00b6 16} To be entitled to the requested writ of mandamus, Lucas County MRDD was required to establish that the retirement board abused its discretion by determining that the claimants were entitled to PERS service credit. <em>State ex rel. Davis v. Pub. Emps. Retirement Bd., </em>120 Ohio St.3d 386, 2008-Ohio-6254, 899 N.E.2d 975, \u00b6 25. To prove an abuse of discretion, Lucas County MRDD must show that the retirement board\u2019s decision was unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable. Id. In addition, the retirement board does not abuse its discretion if there is sufficient evidence to support its determination. See <em>State ex rel. Marchiano v. School Emps. Retirement Sys., 121 </em>Ohio St.3d 139, 2009-Ohio-307, 902 N.E.2d 953, \u00b6 21; <em>State ex rel. Schaengold v. Ohio Pub. Emps. Retirement Sys., </em>114 Ohio St.3d 147, 2007-Ohio-3760, 870 N.E.2d 719, \u00b6 19-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">R.C. 145.01(A)(2) Carryover Public Employees</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">{\u00b6 17} The retirement board is vested with the general administration and management of PERS. R.C. 145.04. \u201cIn all cases of doubt, the public employees retirement board shall determine whether any person is a public employee, and its decision is final.\u201d R.C. 145.01(A)(4); see also Ohio Adm.Code 145-1-11(D) (\u201cThe retirement board\u2019s decision on any determination conducted pursuant to this rule shall be final and determinative\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">{\u00b6 18} Membership in the retirement system \u201cis compulsory upon being employed and shall continue as long as public employment continues.\u201d R.C. 145.03(A). The retirement board concluded that the claimants were public employees entitled to PERS service credit for their employment with CLO because they were carryover employees continuing their public employment under R.C. 145.01(A)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-9\">{\u00b6 19} R.C. 145.01(A)(2) includes as public employees entitled to PERS credit those PERS members who perform duties the same as or similar to duties that they had previously performed for a public entity when they leave public employment to work for a contractor that has contracted to take over what was a publicly operated function:</p>\n<p id=\"b264-10\">{\u00b6 20} \u201c(A) \u2018Public employee\u2019 means:</p>\n<p id=\"b264-11\">{\u00b621}\u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>{\u00b6 22} \u201c(2) A person who is a member of the public employees retirement system and who continues to perform the same or similar duties under the direction of a contractor who has contracted to take over what before the date of the contract was a publicly operated function. The governmental unit with which the contract has been made shall be deemed the employer for purposes of administering this chapter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">Same or Similar Duties</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">{\u00b6 23} Lucas County MRDD asserts that the retirement board abused its discretion in determining that the claimants were carryover public employees under R.C. 145.01(A)(2) because there was no evidence that they performed the \u201csame or similar duties\u201d for CLO and the county board before they resigned.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">{\u00b6 24} \u201cIn analyzing this statute, we determine the legislative intent by reading words and phrases in context and construing them in accordance with rules of grammar and common usage.\u201d See <em>State ex rel. Shisler v. Ohio Pub. Emps. Retirement Sys., </em>122 Ohio St.3d 148, 2009-Ohio-2522, 909 N.E.2d 610, \u00b6 18. \u201c \u2018Same\u2019 means \u2018resembling in every way\u2019 and \u2018identical,\u2019 and \u2018similar\u2019 means \u2018very much alike,\u2019 \u2018comparable,\u2019 and \u2018alike in substance or essentials.\u2019 \u201d <em>State ex rel. Van Dyke v. Pub. Emps. Retirement Bd., </em>99 Ohio St.3d 430, 2003-Ohio-4123, 793 N.E.2d 438, \u00b6 31, quoting Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (1986) 2007 and 2120.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">{\u00b6 25} The evidence before the retirement board included claimant Allen\u2019s testimony that the duties performed by the claimants as case managers and habilitation coordinator for Lucas County MRDD were similar to the duties they had performed as quality-assurance coordinators and specialists for CLO. The claimants assessed and monitored the needs of mentally retarded and developmentally disabled clients while working for both Lucas County MRDD and for CLO. Allen also provided a detailed point-by-point comparison of the duties of case managers at the county board and quality-assurance coordinators at CLO. There was thus sufficient evidence to support the retirement board\u2019s determination that the claimants performed duties at CLO similar to those that they had previously performed at Lucas County MRDD.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-9\">{\u00b6 26} Nor did the retirement board or PERS abuse its discretion by applying a core-function analysis to determine if the duties performed for the county board and for CLO were similar for purposes of R.C. 145.01(A)(2). They determined that the \u201ccounty\u2019s case managers and habilitation coordinators who became CLO quality assurance specialists and coordinators continued * * * to perform the core function of providing housing and habilitation resources to persons with mental retardation and developmental disabilities.\u201d We must give due deference to their reasonable interpretation of the legislative scheme. See <em>State ex rel. Gill v. School Emps. Retirement Sys. of Ohio, </em>121 Ohio St.3d 567, 2009-Ohio-1358, 906 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>N.E.2d 415, \u00b6 28. As the court of appeals properly concluded, \u201cexamining the \u2018function\u2019 inherent in claimants\u2019 duties with [Lucas County MRDD] and with CLO necessarily indicates to what extent the jobs were similar.\u201d 179 Ohio App.3d 439, 2008-Ohio-5754, 902 N.E.2d 503, \u00b6 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">Contractor Taking Over a Publicly Operated Function</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">(\u00b6 27} Lucas County MRDD next asserts that the retirement board abused its discretion in failing to consider that the claimants\u2019 positions with the county board were not outsourced, eliminated, or otherwise reassigned.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">{\u00b6 28} The county board\u2019s argument lacks merit. It was necessary for the retirement board to find only that CLO had \u201ccontracted to take over what before the date of the contract was a publicly operated function.\u201d R.C. 145.01(A)(2). The evidence established that the county board accepted the state appropriation to provide supported-living services and assumed the responsibilities to coordinate and manage these services well before CLO started providing these services. CLO\u2019s first executive director admitted that CLO \u201ctook over\u201d the function of developing plans for supported-living clients from case managers employed by the county board. This was sufficient evidence to support the retirement board\u2019s conclusion that CLO had taken over what had previously been a public function performed by the county board.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-9\">{\u00b6 29} Moreover, insofar as Lucas County MRDD attempts to rely on new matter that is not contained in the record on appeal, we cannot consider it. See <em>State ex rel. Wells v. Jefferson Cty. Court of Common Pleas, </em>122 Ohio St.3d 39, 2009-Ohio-2358, 907 N.E.2d 1166, \u00b6 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-11\">{\u00b6 30} Finally, Lucas County MRDD\u2019s reliance on <em>State ex rel. Mallory v. Pub. Emps. Retirement Bd. </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 235, 694 N.E.2d 1356, and <em>Van Dyke, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 430, 2003-Ohio-4123, 793 N.E.2d 438, is misplaced. Neither of those cases, in which we addressed the carryover provision of R.C. 145.01(A)(2), supports issuance of the requested writ of mandamus here.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-12\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b266-13\">{\u00b6 31} Based on the foregoing, the retirement board acted neither unreasonably, arbitrarily, nor unconscionably in determining that the claimants were carryover public employees under R.C. 145.01(A)(2) during their employment as quality-assurance coordinators and specialists with CLO. The retirement board\u2019s decision is supported by sufficient evidence. Therefore, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals denying the requested extraordinary relief in mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-14\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b266-15\">Moyer, C.J., and Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<attorneys id=\"Ab5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>Julia R.
