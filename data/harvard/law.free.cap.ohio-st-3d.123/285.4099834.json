Jones of Bethesda, Maryland, Attorney Registration No. 0064099, was admitted to the practice of law in Ohio in 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">{\u00b6 2} The Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline recommends that we publicly reprimand respondent, based on findings that he failed for approximately eight months after opening a decedent\u2019s estate to completely list next of kin, identify estate assets and liabilities, and communicate with his client. We accept the finding that respondent committed this professional misconduct; however, given his substandard performance in this probate proceeding and the inconvenience and delay this caused his client, we conclude that a six-month suspension, stayed on the condition of a one-year monitored probation, is the appropriate sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">{\u00b6 3} Relator, Mahoning County Bar Association, charged respondent with violating three Disciplinary Rules of the former Code of Professional Responsibility: DR 6-101(A)(3) (prohibiting a lawyer from neglecting an entrusted legal matter), 7-101(A)(2) (prohibiting a lawyer from intentionally failing to carry out a contract for the lawyer\u2019s professional services), and 2-106(A) (prohibiting a lawyer from collecting a clearly excessive fee). A panel of three board members heard the case, and after relator dismissed the DR 2-106(A) charge, made findings of fact, conclusions of law, and a recommendation for a six-month license suspension, stayed on condition of a one-year monitored probation. The board adopted the panel\u2019s findings of misconduct, but \u201cbased on the single case of delay and no demonstrable harm to the client,\u201d recommended that respondent be publicly reprimanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-9\">{\u00b6 4} The parties have not objected to the board report.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-10\">Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b400-11\">{\u00b6 5} Respondent, who has been registered on inactive status in Ohio since September 1, 2007, is currently employed in the Washington D.C. area as an in-house corporate counsel, a position that according to him does not require admission to the bar in any particular state. Respondent and relator stipulated to the facts underlying the complaint and to his violations of DR 6-101(A)(3) and 7-101(A)(2). The misconduct occurred while respondent was assisting a widow in the administration of her husband\u2019s uncomplicated decedent estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>{\u00b6 6} Respondent agreed to represent the client with respect to her husband\u2019s estate, which basically entailed the transfer of title to an automobile and their residential real estate. In late September 2006, he obtained a $3,710 fee advance from his client, which he deposited and retained in his client trust account. He then filed applications to probate the estate and to relieve the estate from administration in the Mahoning County Probate Court. The case thereafter languished over the succeeding months, leaving the client to try without success at least 15 times to contact respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">{\u00b6 7} The probate court conducted a status conference in late May 2007. Respondent\u2019s client appeared, but respondent did not, because he had not received notice. The probate magistrate\u2019s decision faulted respondent for having failed after opening the estate to identify his client as the surviving spouse on the next-of-kin form. Also missing from the application for relief from administration was the form listing the estate assets and liabilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">{\u00b6 8} The magistrate additionally disapproved of the amount of respondent\u2019s fee and his failure to obtain prior probate court approval. The magistrate consequently advised the client to obtain new counsel and a refund. He also advised the client to file a grievance.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">{\u00b6 9} The client did obtain new counsel, who promptly wound up the estate. Upon that attorney\u2019s demand for the return of fees other than for filing costs, respondent partially repaid his former client.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Based on the parties\u2019 stipulations and respondent\u2019s hearing testimony, the panel and board found clear and convincing proof that respondent had violated DR 6 \u2014 101(A)(3) and 7 \u2014 101 (A)(2). We accept those findings of misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">Sanction</p>\n<p id=\"b401-9\">{\u00b6 10} In recommending a sanction for this misconduct, the panel and board weighed the mitigating and aggravating factors of respondent\u2019s case. See BCGD Proe.Reg. 10(B)(1) and (2). Mitigating factors included that respondent had no prior record of discipline, had acknowledged wrongdoing and made restitution apparently to his former client\u2019s satisfaction, and had cooperated during the disciplinary proceedings. See BCGD Proe.Reg. 10(B)(2)(a), (c), and (d). The panel and board did not specify any aggravating factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-10\">{\u00b6 11} We agree with the panel\u2019s reasoning and recommendation. Although respondent cooperated with the investigation, made restitution to the client, and has no history of disciplinary violations, the misconduct in this case warrants more than a public reprimand. Respondent took a disproportionately large fee to administer a simple estate in probate, but did not perform the work, tending <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>instead to his own personal affairs. In addition, his client was unable to reach him despite having made 15 attempts.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A6-\">Comstock, Springer &amp; Wilson Co., L.P.A., and David C. Comstock Jr.; and Ronald E. Slipski, for relator.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b402-11\">James S. Jones, pro se.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">{\u00b6 12} Although the magistrate\u2019s actions helped to right the ship, the harm had already been done \u2014 the magistrate\u2019s advice came nine months into the administration of what was, by all accounts, a simple estate, closed by the successor attorney in two and a half months, with only four and a half hours of labor. While the matter was in his hands, respondent mishandled and neglected the case and refused to return the client\u2019s phone calls.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">{\u00b6 13} Respondent is therefore suspended from the practice of law in Ohio for six months; however, the suspension is stayed on the conditions that he successfully complete a one-year monitored probation under Gov.Bar R. V(9) and commit no further disciplinary infractions. The suspension, stay, and probation will take effect upon respondent\u2019s return to active practice in this state. If respondent fails to comply with the terms of the stay and probation, the stay will be lifted, and respondent will serve the entire six-month suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">{\u00b6 14} Costs are taxed to respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b402-8\">Moyer, C.J., and Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b402-9\">Pfeifer, J., dissents and would publicly reprimand the respondent.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b401-11\">.
