Because we hold that the ordinance does not violate due process, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and reinstate the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-10\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b247-11\">{\u00b6 2} On April 18, 2007, at 8:00 a.m., David Roch was walking his 16-pound wire fox terrier in Mill Creek Park in Youngstown, Ohio, when he was approached by two unaccompanied Italian mastiff/Cane Corso dogs, one male and one female. The Mahoning County dog warden estimated the male dog to be about 170 to 180 pounds, and the female was slightly smaller.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-12\">{\u00b6 3} Roch restrained his dog and attempted to calm the larger dogs, which were becoming increasingly agitated. One of the dogs attacked Roch\u2019s dog, and when Roch attempted to rescue his dog from the skirmish, Roch was attacked, sustaining an injury to his hand. Roch\u2019s dog required surgery and stitches for injuries to her ear and head.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-13\">{\u00b6 4} After the attack, Roch\u2019s dog, which had been taken off her leash, fled, and Roch sought shelter in the garage of Maureen Cronin, a neighbor who witnessed the attack. Cronin called Mill Creek Park Police Officer Carolyn Grimaldi, who arrived to find two dogs standing in Cronin\u2019s driveway. Officer Grimaldi shot and killed one of the dogs as it ran toward her. The other dog fled, and a few minutes later, Youngstown Police Officer Matthew Willis spotted it. Officer Willis testified that when the dog saw him, it looked agitated and aggressive. When the dog fast approached him, Officer Willis shot and killed it.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-14\">{\u00b6 5} After a joint investigation involving the Mill Creek Park Police Department, the Youngstown Police Department, and the Mahoning County dog war<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>den\u2019s office, investigators learned that the owner of the dogs was Jammie Traylor, defendant-appellee. Traylor confirmed that he had two dogs that were missing, but when shown the remains of the dogs, he admitted owning only the female. Witnesses testified that they had seen Traylor with both dogs several weeks before the attack. Traylor admitted at his sentencing hearing that he owned the female and that the male had been present at his home for breeding purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">{\u00b6 6} Traylor was charged with two first-degree misdemeanors, violations under Youngstown Codified Ordinances (\u201cYCO\u201d) 505.19(b), entitled \u201cVicious Dogs.\u201d Traylor filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that YCO 505.19 is unconstitutional. The trial court denied Traylor\u2019s motion. A jury ultimately convicted Traylor on the lesser included offense to count one and of the offense as charged in count two. The trial court sentenced Traylor to 90 days in jail and ordered him to pay restitution to Roch, complete two years of intensive supervised probation upon his release, pay fines and costs, and own \u201cnothing bigger than a Chihuahua\u201d as a condition of his probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">{\u00b6 7} The Mahoning County Court of Appeals vacated Traylor\u2019s convictions and discharged him, holding that YCO 505.19 was unconstitutional. <em>Youngstown v. Traylor, </em>Mahoning App. No. 07MA102, 2008-Ohio-2971, 2008 WL 2441368. The city appealed, and this court accepted jurisdiction. <em>Youngstown v. Traylor, </em>120 Ohio St.3d 1415, 2008-Ohio-6166, 897 N.E.2d 651.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">{\u00b6 8} The issue before this court is whether YCO 505.19 violates procedural due process by failing to give notice to a dog owner that his dog will be considered vicious for purposes of criminal prosecution and/or by failing to allow the owner a meaningful opportunity to be heard on his dog\u2019s classification as vicious. The right to procedural due process is found in the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Section 16, Article I of the Ohio Constitution. <em>State v. Hayden, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 211, 2002-Ohio-4169, 773 N.E.2d 502, \u00b6 6. \u201cAlthough the concept is flexible, at its core, procedural due process under both the Ohio and United States Constitutions requires, at a minimum, an opportunity to be heard when the state seeks to infringe a protected liberty or property right.\u201d <em>State v. Cowan, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 144, 2004-Ohio-4777, 814 N.E.2d 846, \u00b6 8, citing <em>Boddie v. Connecticut </em>(1971), 401 U.S. 371, 377, 91 S.Ct. 780, 28 L.Ed.2d 113.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-9\">{\u00b6 9} Although dogs are \u201cprivate property to a qualified extent, they are subject to the state police power, and \u2018might be destroyed or otherwise dealt with, as in the judgment of the legislature is necessary for the protection of its citizens. * * * [Legislatures have broad police power to regulate all dogs so as to protect the public against the nuisance posed by a vicious dog.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number><em>Anderson </em>(1991), 57 Ohio St.3d 168, 170, 566 N.E.2d 1224, quoting <em>Sentell v. New Orleans &amp; Carrollton RR. Co. </em>(1897), 166 U.S. 698, 701-704, 17 S.Ct. 693, 41 L.Ed. 1169. Thus, in this case, as in other animal-control cases, we are balancing the state\u2019s interest in protecting its citizens from vicious animals with the dog owner\u2019s due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">{\u00b6 10} The text of the ordinance at issue is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cYCO 505.19 Vicious Dogs.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">{\u00b6 12} \u201c(a) No person owning or harboring or having the care of a vicious dog shall suffer or permit such animal to go unconfined on the premises of such person.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-9\">{\u00b6 13} \u201c(b) No person owning or harboring or having the care of a vicious dog shall suffer or permit such dog to go beyond the premises of such person unless such dog is securely leashed or otherwise securely restrained.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-10\">{\u00b6 14} \u201c(c) Definitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-11\">{\u00b6 15} \u201c(1) A vicious dog is \u2018unconfined\u2019 as the term is used in this section, if such dog is not restrained by a secure fence, other secure enclosure or any other security device which effectively prevents such dog from going beyond the premises of the person described in subsection (a) hereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-12\">{\u00b6 16} \u201c(2) Vicious dog\u2019 as used in this section means:</p>\n<p id=\"b249-13\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cA. Any dog with a propensity, tendency or disposition to attack, to cause injury to or to otherwise endanger the safety of human beings or other domestic animals; and</p>\n<p id=\"b249-14\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cB. Any dog which attacks a human being or another domestic animal without provocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-15\">{\u00b6 19} \u201c(d) Subsections (a) and (b) hereof are necessary controls on the unrestrained activity of vicious animals which threaten the safety and pleasantness of streets, parks, sidewalks, yards and all areas of the City and lack of knowledge or lack of intent is not a defense to a violation thereof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b249-16\">{\u00b6 20} In examining the constitutionality of this ordinance, we look to two recent vicious-dog cases. In <em>Cowan, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 144, 2004-Ohio-4777, 814 N.E.2d 846, this court examined whether R.C. 955.22, a state statute requiring confinement of dangerous or vicious dogs, violated procedural due process. We held that the statute was unconstitutional because it failed to provide the dog owner with a meaningful opportunity to be heard on the dog\u2019s classification and labeled dogs dangerous or vicious because of their breed only. Id. at \u00b6 13. Once the dog warden had made the unilateral decision to classify Cowan\u2019s dogs as vicious, R.C. 955.22 placed restrictions and requirements on Cowan and her dogs, such as purchasing liability insurance, without the right to an appeal or an administrative hearing. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>{\u00b6 21} Traylor relied on <em>Cowan </em>to support his position that YCO 505.19 is unconstitutional. However, as the trial court held, Traylor was charged under the vicious-dog ordinance <em>not </em>because of the breed of his dogs, but rather, because his dogs had allegedly attacked a human and/or another domestic animal without provocation, as prohibited by YCO 505.19(c)(2)B. Here, the trial court concluded that there was no presumption that the dogs were vicious; rather, their viciousness was an element of the crime that the state had the burden of proving \u2014 i.e., that the dogs had attacked a human being or another domestic animal without provocation. Thus, the trial court found that the facts in this case separated it from the analysis in <em>Cowan.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">{\u00b6 22} Between the trial court\u2019s ruling and the court of appeals\u2019 decision in this case, we decided <em>Toledo v. Tellings, </em>114 Ohio St.3d 278, 2007-Ohio-3724, 871 N.E.2d 1152, in which we considered a Toledo Municipal Code section as well as two state statutes, R.C. 955.11 and 955.22. The municipal code section limited ownership of vicious dogs, as defined in R.C. 955.11, or dogs commonly known as pit bulls or pit bull mixed breeds, to one in each household, and the Revised Code required an owner of a pit bull to obtain liability insurance for damages, injuries, or death that might be caused by the dog. Id. at \u00b6 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">{\u00b6 23} In upholding the three provisions, this court concluded that the state and the city of Toledo possess the constitutional authority to exercise police powers that are rationally related to a legitimate interest in public health, safety, morals, or general welfare. We determined that the evidence proved that pit bulls cause more damage than other dogs when they attack, cause more fatalities in Ohio than other dogs, and cause Toledo police officers to fire their weapons more often than do other breeds. Thus, we held that the state of Ohio and the city of Toledo had a legitimate interest in protecting citizens from the dangers associated with pit bulls and that R.C. 955.11(A)(4)(a)(iii) and 955.22 and Toledo Municipal Code 505.14 are rationally related to that interest. Therefore, these provisions are constitutional. Id. at \u00b6 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">{\u00b6 24} The court of appeals held that <em>Tellings </em>was inapplicable to this case because the case at bar does not involve pit bulls and because YCO 505.19 does not contain a classification of this breed as a definition of \u201cvicious.\u201d <em>Youngstown v. Traylor, </em>2008-Ohio-2971, \u00b6 27. Rather, the court of appeals found the facts of <em>Cowan </em>to be \u201cvirtually identical\u201d to those in this case. Id. at \u00b6 14. Thus, the court of appeals held that YCO 505.19 violated procedural due process because of the \u201cimposition of additional legal duties and restrictions on the dog owner.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 23. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">{\u00b6 25} In holding that R.C. 955.22 was not unconstitutional as applied to owners of pit bulls in <em>Tellings, </em>we clarified that in <em>Cowan, </em>it was the unilateral classification of the dogs as vicious by a state actor that trampled the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>due process rights by fading to give him notice and opportunity to be heard. <em>Tellings, </em>114 Ohio St.3d 278, 2007-Ohio-3724, 871 N.E.2d 1152, \u00b6 32. YCO 505.19 simply shifts the risk of dog ownership to the dog owner in order to protect the public.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">{\u00b6 26} As for the opportunity to be heard, YCO 505.19 does not permit any unilateral, unreviewable, precharge determination by a state actor, unlike the statute involved in <em>Cowan. </em>Moreover, YCO 505.19 does not create prehearing burdens on dog owners, such as requiring liability insurance for particular breeds. In <em>Cowan, </em>we rejected the statute\u2019s failure to provide the owner an opportunity to challenge the vicious label before trial. However, YCO 505.19 does not classify or label dogs as vicious. Dogs are rendered vicious under the ordinance by their propensity to attack or by their attack, and dog owners are merely required to keep such dogs confined.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">{\u00b6 27} Traylor\u2019s dogs were alleged to be vicious in his criminal complaint, and Traylor was given an opportunity for meaningful review in front of the trial court. Notably, Traylor did not present any evidence regarding the temperament or disposition of his unlicensed dogs at the hearing on the motion to dismiss. YCO 505.19 does not place any responsibilities on the dog owner until the state proves its case beyond a reasonable doubt. Rather, YCO 505.19 simply requires dog owners to keep their dogs on their property.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">{\u00b6 28} The Tenth District Court of Appeals considered a similar case in which a German shepherd had attacked a dog on a leash, and the owner was charged under a local ordinance. <em>State v. Conte, </em>10th Dist. No. 07AP-33, 2007-Ohio-5924, 2007 WL 3257378. The court made two observations that are applicable in this case: first, the city ordinance in <em>Conte </em>did not involve an \u201cunreviewable, unilateral determination that the animal was \u2018vicious or dangerous.\u2019 Rather, [the state] must prove at trial that appellee\u2019s dog is vicious or dangerous as an element of the offense. [The owner] has the opportunity to contest that allegation.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 15. Second, the city ordinance \u201cdoes not impose any additional obligations on a dog owner.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b251-9\">{\u00b6 29} Traylor\u2019s dogs, unprovoked, attacked Roch and his dog while the dogs were off their property. Traylor argues that an owner cannot know that his dog is vicious until he is convicted under the ordinance. To hold otherwise, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>would be to permit each dog \u201cone free bite,\u201d a result that would clearly leave society at risk. A responsibility of dog ownership is to maintain and control the animal. This ordinance requires no more and no less, and, therefore, it does not violate procedural due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">{\u00b6 30} We hold that Youngstown Codified Ordinances 505.19 is rationally related to the city\u2019s legitimate interest in protecting citizens from vicious dogs and therefore is constitutional. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and reinstate the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b252-6\">Moyer, C.J., and O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b252-7\">Pfeifer and Lanzinger, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b251-10\">.

Cowan, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 144, 2004-Ohio-4777, 814 N.E.2d 846, at syllabus, we stated that R.C. 955.22, the statute addressing \u201cvicious\u201d dogs, \u201cviolates the constitutional right to procedural due process insofar as it fails to provide dog owners a meaningful opportunity to be heard on the issue of whether a dog is \u2018vicious.\u2019 \u201d This conclusion answers the issue before us. Traylor was charged with not restraining a \u201cvicious\u201d dog, but he had no notice that his dog was \u201cvicious.\u201d In <em>Cowan, </em>the dog owner was aware that her dogs had been labeled vicious; she had <em>merely </em>not been given an opportunity to challenge that determination. Id. at \u00b6 15. This case is even more egregious because Traylor not only doesn\u2019t have an opportunity to challenge the \u201cvicious\u201d label, he had no way to know that his dog is \u201cvicious.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b252-10\">{\u00b6 32} The outcome of this case is morally repugnant. The owner of a dog is being sent to jail for 90 days based on his failure to do something he could not know he was supposed to do. \u201cVicious\u201d dogs must be restrained. Youngstown Codified Ordinances (\u201cYCO\u201d) 505.19. But Traylor\u2019s dog was not \u201cvicious\u201d until the moment it bit a human, at which point it was too late for Traylor to restrain his dog. YCO 505.19 imposes obligations on dog owners that they do not know they need to comply with until they have no opportunity to comply. The most troubling part of this case isn\u2019t that a municipality would pass such an ordinance; it\u2019s that this court is sanctioning it. See <em>State v. Price, </em>118 Ohio St.3d 144, 2008-Ohio-1974, 886 N.E.2d 852, at \u00b6 38 (\u201c[defendant] is owed what every criminal defendant is owed: notice that his conduct is illegal\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-11\">{\u00b6 33} This court is turning a blind eye to basic tenets of fundamental fairness. See R.C. 2901.21(A)(1) (a \u201cperson\u2019s [criminal] liability is based on conduct that includes either a voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>person is capable of performing\u201d). Traylor was not capable of restraining his \u201cvicious\u201d dog until he knew it was vicious. Allowing Youngstown to impose criminal liability based on a contemporaneous labeling of a dog as \u201cvicious\u201d is not different from imposing criminal liability on an \u201caccident-prone\u201d driver and defining \u201caccident-prone\u201d as anyone who gets in a car accident. It just doesn\u2019t make sense. And it\u2019s unconstitutional. See <em>Papachristou v. Jacksonville </em>(1972), 405 U.S. 156, 162, 92 S.Ct. 839, 31 L.Ed.2d 110, quoting <em>United States v. Harriss </em>(1954), 347 U.S. 612, 617, 74 S.Ct. 808, 98 L.Ed. 989 (an ordinance violates due process when it \u201c \u2018fails to give a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice that his contemplated conduct is forbidden by statute\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">{\u00b6 34} Furthermore, Youngstown should not be able to define what constitutes a \u201cvicious\u201d dog, because the General Assembly has already done so. R.C. 955.11(A)(4)(a). The parties did not address this issue, and the record is not fully developed, so it is difficult to determine whether YCO 505.19 would survive a home-rule analysis. See <em>Ohioans for Concealed Carry, Inc. v. Clyde, </em>120 Ohio St.3d 96, 2008-Ohio-4605, 896 N.E.2d 967, \u00b6 24. Based on what the record does reveal, it seems likely that YCO 505.19 would not survive. YCO 505.19 is an exercise of local self-government. Id. at \u00b6 23. But R.C. Chapter 955 appears to be a general law, and R.C. 955.11(A)(4)(a) and YCO 505.19(c)(2) are clearly in conflict. See <em>Clyde </em>at \u00b6 25. Pursuant to this, admittedly cursory, analysis, R.C. 955.11(A)(4)(a) would prevail over YCO 505.19(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">{\u00b6 35} This court did not engage in a home-rule analysis, in large part because the parties did not argue the issue. By avoiding that issue, however, this court is sanctioning the imposition of criminal liability for something that the General Assembly has determined is not a crime. According to R.C. 955.22, the owner of a dog cannot be criminally liable for acts of that dog unless the dog has already been determined to be \u201cvicious.\u201d Unlike YCO 505.19, R.C. 955.22 and related statutes do not allow a dog to be labeled vicious and its owner to be criminally liable based on the same act.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">{\u00b6 36} YCO 505.19 violates the Constitution by not providing fundamental due process protections. I would affirm the judgment of the court of appeals. I dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b253-9\">Lanzinger, J., concurs in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b253-10\">Lanzinger, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A5R\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-11\">{\u00b6 37} I join Justice Pfeifer\u2019s dissent. With respect to the majority\u2019s concern over \u201cone free bite,\u201d a dog owner cannot totally evade responsibility for the consequences of failure to restrain a dog \u2014 there is always the potential for civil liability. We held in <em>State v. Cowan, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 144, 2004-Ohio-4777, 814 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>N.E.2d 846, syllabus, that a statute requiring the confinement of vicious dogs violates the constitutional right to procedural due process if it fails to provide dog owners a meaningful opportunity to be heard on the issue of whether a dog is vicious. I would affirm the judgment of the court of appeals that the reasoning in <em>Cowan </em>controls the outcome of this case.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Ajn\">Joseph R.
