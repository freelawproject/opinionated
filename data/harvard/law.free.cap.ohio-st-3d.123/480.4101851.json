The Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline now recommends that we indefinitely suspend respondent\u2019s license to practice, based on findings that he deserted an incarcerated client seeking postconviction relief and then failed to respond during the ensuing disciplinary investigation. We accept the board\u2019s findings that respondent violated ethical standards incumbent on lawyers in this state and the board\u2019s recommendation for an indefinite suspension of respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-13\">{\u00b6 2} Relator, Disciplinary Counsel, charged respondent with two counts of professional misconduct, mainly involving violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct. Relator served respondent with notice of the complaint, but he failed to answer, and relator moved for default. See Gov.Bar R. V(6)(F). A master commissioner appointed by the board recommended that the motion be granted, making findings of fact, conclusions of law, and a recommendation for respon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>dent\u2019s indefinite suspension from practice. In effect granting the motion for default, the board adopted the master commissioner\u2019s findings of misconduct and recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">\n<em>Count I</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">{\u00b6 3} The Preble County Court of Common Pleas appointed respondent in January 2008 to represent an incarcerated client in postconviction proceedings. The client wrote to respondent that January and February, asking to discuss his case. Respondent failed without explanation to respond to his client and never filed anything on his behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-8\">{\u00b6 4} The board found that by doing nothing for his client, respondent had violated Prof.Cond.R. 1.3 (requiring a lawyer to act diligently in representing a client) and 1.4(a)(3) (requiring a lawyer to \u201ckeep the client reasonably informed about the status of the matter\u201d) and (4) (requiring a lawyer to \u201ccomply as soon as practicable with reasonable requests for information from the client\u201d). And because respondent failed to honor his court appointment, the board found that he had violated Prof.Cond.R. 8.4(d) (prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in \u201cconduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice\u201d) and (h) (prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct that \u201cadversely reflects on the lawyer\u2019s fitness to practice law\u201d). We accept these findings of misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-9\">\n<em>Count II</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b595-10\">{\u00b6 5} The client reported respondent\u2019s neglect to relator. Despite his professional duty to respond during the ensuing disciplinary investigation, respondent ignored virtually all notice of that proceeding. Respondent replied only once, when in mid-August 2008 relator\u2019s investigator personally delivered notice of the grievance to him, and respondent promised to \u201ctake care of it.\u201d The board recounted relator\u2019s efforts to obtain a suitable response during the investigation:</p>\n<p id=\"b595-11\">{\u00b6 6} \u201ca. On May 30, 2008, Respondent was notified by certified mail of the April 28, 2008, grievance of [his] client. The receipt was signed on June 16, 2008, but there was no response.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-12\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cb. On June 25, 2008 and July 9, 2008, further letters [of] notice [were] sent via certified mail to the address supplied by Respondent to the office of Attorney Registration at the Supreme Court. Both were returned unclaimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-13\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cc. Regular mail notice and inquiry were sent July 22, 2008, by regular mail to which Respondent did not reply.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-14\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cd. On August 14, 2008, Relator, through its investigator, personally delivered a second letter of inquiry to the Respondent with advice to respond. Respondent never responded to Disciplinary Counsel.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A6L2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>Jonathan E. Coughlan, Disciplinary Counsel, and Stacy Solochek Beckman, Assistant Disciplinary Counsel, for relator.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b596-3\">{\u00b6 10} \u201ce. A subpoena duces tecum was served by Relator\u2019s investigator personally upon Respondent on September 9, 2008, setting an appearance on October [3], 2008. Respondent failed to appear or contact Relator.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">{\u00b6 11} The board found that respondent had violated Prof.Cond.R. 8.1(b) (requiring a lawyer, with an exception not relevant here, to respond to \u201ca demand for information from [a] * * * disciplinary authority\u201d) and, consequently, that he had also violated Prof.Cond.R. 8.4(d) and (h). We accept these findings of misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">Sanction</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">{\u00b6 12} In recommending a sanction for respondent\u2019s misconduct, the board consulted sanctions imposed in similar cases and considered whether aggravating or mitigating factors warrant a more severe or lenient disposition. BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">(\u00b6 13} The board relied principally on <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Boylan </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 115, 707 N.E.2d 465, in which we ordered a lawyer\u2019s indefinite suspension from practice. Like respondent, that lawyer neglected a client he had accepted by court appointment \u2014 he failed to file an appellate brief and caused dismissal of the appeal \u2014 and then did not respond to investigative inquiries about the client\u2019s grievance. Noting his unacceptable indifference toward the process for policing the legal profession, we said that \u201can indefinite suspension from the practice of law \u2018is especially fitting * * * where neglect of a legal matter is coupled with a failure to cooperate in the ensuing disciplinary investigation.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 117, 707 N.E.2d 465, quoting <em>Warren Cty. Bar Assn. v. Lieser </em>(1997), 79 Ohio St.3d 488, 490, 683 N.E.2d 1148. And as the board found, the single mitigating factor that respondent has no previous disciplinary record, BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(2)(a), does not warrant a departure from <em>Boylan.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b596-8\">{\u00b6 14} Respondent is therefore indefinitely suspended from the practice of law in Ohio. Pursuant to Gov.Bar R. V(10)(B), he may not petition for reinstatement before two years from the date of our order. Costs are taxed to respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-9\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b596-10\">Moyer, C.J., and Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
