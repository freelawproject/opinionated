Kimmins, Attorney Registration No. 0024739, with a registration address in Massillon, Ohio, was admitted to the practice of law in Ohio in 1963. The Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline has recommended that we suspend his license to practice law for one year, all stayed on conditions, based on findings that he advanced financial assistance to a client while representing him in pending litigation, retained the client\u2019s property without disclosing that fact, misused the client\u2019s confidential information, made misrepresentations to the client\u2019s family, and failed to maintain complete records and render appropriate accounts to the client regarding the client\u2019s property. We agree that respondent committed professional misconduct as found by the board and that a one-year suspension, all stayed on conditions, is the appropriate sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-12\">{\u00b6 2} Relator, Disciplinary Counsel, charged respondent with multiple violations of the Disciplinary Rules of the former Code of Professional Responsibility. A panel of the board heard the case, dismissed some of the charges alleged in the complaint, found that respondent had committed professional misconduct, and recommended a one-year suspension, all stayed on conditions. The board adopted the panel\u2019s findings and recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"AEe\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">{\u00b6 3} Respondent represented Joseph Arvine Steiner in a dispute related to his mother\u2019s estate after she died in August 2002. For over 40 years, Steiner had lived at a house owned by his mother and had, during that time, stored on the premises automotive and commercial equipment and other items that he intended to repair and sell in order to augment his income after retirement. Inside the house, the roof had leaked and damaged the kitchen, and the plumbing had problems. Steiner also kept boxes of leftover chicken dinners and jars of applesauce in the refrigerator and stored piles of paper, tools, and equipment throughout the house. Steiner admitted that he would not invite people over to his house on account of its deterioration.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">{\u00b6 4} In March 2004, Steiner informed respondent that he had decided to retire from his job as a mechanic at Peoples Cartage, a trucking company, and sought advice on his financial situation while he waited for his pension payments to commence. Although Steiner had not requested a loan, he agreed to accept $5,000 from respondent to be deposited in a power-of-attorney account for the purposes of paying bills and covering the expenses of the pending case until his mother\u2019s estate closed. Steiner also executed a durable power of attorney appointing respondent his attorney-in-fact. Respondent then opened the power-of-attorney account jointly in his own and Steiner\u2019s names, and he paid Steiner\u2019s bills out of that account and out of his own attorney trust account.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">{\u00b6 5} A week after Steiner executed the power of attorney, he settled the dispute over his mother\u2019s estate for $40,000, various bonds, and title to his mother\u2019s house, with respondent retaining $12,000 pursuant to their contingent-fee agreement. Steiner had left a large number of tools with his former employer. Respondent called Eugene Hawk, explaining that he had \u201c \u2018a client here that\u2019s got a bum leg\u2019 \u201d who had recently retired from Peoples Cartage and asking Hawk to pick up the tools for him. Steiner picked up the phone, identified himself, and said he didn\u2019t need any help.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">{\u00b6 6} In late March 2004, Steiner and respondent met at a restaurant for breakfast, during which Steiner admitted being depressed over the settlement and over the discord and division it had wrought in his family. Respondent drove Steiner to his house, and after touring it, respondent persuaded Steiner to go with him to a hospital to have his depression and varicose veins evaluated. Steiner voluntarily admitted himself to the hospital, and his doctor diagnosed him with severe depression.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">{\u00b6 7} Having viewed the condition of Steiner\u2019s property and considering it unfit for human habitation, respondent decided to act. Using the power of attorney, respondent began cleaning up the scrap metal, machines, building supplies, vehicles, and other items on the inside and the outside of the house. Respondent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>admitted knowing that Steiner would not have approved of liquidating his assets in this manner and had not executed the power of attorney envisioning that respondent would use it to remediate the property. However, respondent claimed that the laws of Steiner\u2019s township and Steiner\u2019s best interests required a massive cleanup operation, and Steiner\u2019s fragile mental health necessitated commencing it without Steiner\u2019s knowledge or express consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">{\u00b6 8} Respondent hired Hawk to sell the items Steiner had collected outside the house. Hawk then began moving items off the property, while respondent and others began sorting through the personal items in the house to determine what was garbage, what should be moved to a storage unit, and what should be left in the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">{\u00b6 9} Meanwhile, respondent informed Steiner\u2019s children of their father\u2019s hospitalization, and he obtained their consent to continue the cleanup operation by telling them that Steiner\u2019s doctor had said that Steiner was a threat to himself and others, that Steiner had financial problems, that social services was involved, that Steiner\u2019s property was out of compliance with the township zoning ordinance, and that Steiner would not be able to return home if they did not remedy the problems at the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">{\u00b6 10} By April 2, 2004, Steiner asked his friend Lou Pappas to check out his property because of his concern that something unusual was occurring there. Pappas reported that Hawk had begun hauling items off the property and scrapping items that could have been sold for value. Although Steiner now had knowledge that respondent had begun using the power of attorney to clean up his property, he did not protest, revoke the power of attorney, or check himself out of the hospital. Moreover, on the date of his discharge from the hospital, April 5, Steiner visited his property, yet he did not revoke the power of attorney. Steiner explained that he feared that raising objections would have resulted in his being committed to a mental hospital. Nonetheless, he admitted agreeing with the plan to clean up the property in order to sell it.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">{\u00b6 11} That same day, Steiner\u2019s son, Joe Steiner Jr., drafted a letter authorizing the cleanup, but he reserved several items from sale and required respondent to maintain an inventory. Steiner then accompanied his son to Georgia, where he was to stay while the cleanup continued. However, after talking to his father, Joe Steiner Jr. became suspicious of respondent\u2019s description of Steiner\u2019s mental and legal problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-9\">{\u00b6 12} Joe Steiner Jr. confirmed that his father\u2019s doctor had never stated that Steiner would kill himself or others in three to six months, and he discovered that the property had not been cited by the township for being out of compliance with the zoning ordinance. Joe Steiner Jr. testified that when he confronted respondent about his prior statements, respondent threatened him. When Steiner took <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>the phone and questioned respondent on the decision to give away so much of his property, respondent terminated the relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">{\u00b6 13} After April 7, 2004, respondent distributed the funds he received in the settlement of Steiner\u2019s challenge in the estate case, and he prepared two inventories accounting for much of Steiner\u2019s property. However, respondent failed to keep an accurate inventory of the property sold or discarded. He admitted that he lacked personal knowledge that all of the household property taken from inside the house either remained on the property or ended up in storage.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">{\u00b6 14} For example, respondent did not account for decorative stone that Hawk delivered to respondent\u2019s residence, a few pieces of which respondent\u2019s gardener had used in landscaping at respondent\u2019s farm. Respondent made no attempt to return the stone, which remained on his property as of the hearing date, and although he testified to his belief that the stone had no value, a stone dealer appraised it at relator\u2019s request at a value of $1,260. Also, although the second inventory indicated that a school bus Steiner owned had been returned to the property, that had not happened. Respondent also represented that he had received $400 for scrap collected from the property when in fact he had received $322. Similarly, the inventory indicates that respondent received $3,000 for a white fifth-wheel truck, but Steiner had not been paid for it. Moreover, the inventory does not account for an N-Model truck, a .22 rifle, and copper that Steiner owned. Respondent admitted that it was impossible to keep track of Steiner\u2019s possessions, that not all of the property had been returned to Steiner, and that none of the money that had been paid for the items removed from the property had made its way to Steiner.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">{\u00b6 15} We accept the board\u2019s finding that respondent\u2019s $5,000 loan to Steiner violated DR 5 \u2014 103(B) (a lawyer shall not provide financial assistance to a client in connection with litigation unrelated to court costs or litigation expenses), that his misrepresentations to Steiner\u2019s children regarding their father\u2019s mental health and whether Steiner\u2019s property complied with the township\u2019s code violated DR 1-102(A)(4) (a lawyer shall not engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation), and that his misuse of Steiner\u2019s confidential information to his disadvantage to solicit the support of Steiner\u2019s children for the cleanup operation, which he knew Steiner would oppose, violated DR 4-101(B)(2) (a lawyer shall not knowingly use a client\u2019s confidence to the client\u2019s disadvantage) and 1-102(A)(6) (a lawyer shall not engage in any other conduct that adversely reflects upon the lawyer\u2019s fitness to practice law). We also accept the board\u2019s finding that respondent\u2019s retention of the decorative stone violated DR 1-102(A)(4) and that his failure to adequately and honestly account for Steiner\u2019s property violated DR 9-102(B)(3) (a lawyer shall maintain complete records of all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>funds, securities, and other properties of a client coming into the possession of the lawyer) and 1-102(A)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">{\u00b6 16} We agree with the board\u2019s conclusion that clear and convincing evidence does not support relator\u2019s allegations that respondent violated DR 1-102(A)(6) in his use of the power of attorney, 4 \u2014 101(B)(1) (prohibiting a lawyer from knowingly revealing a client\u2019s confidences or secrets) and 1-102(A)(6) in discussing Steiner\u2019s health and financial issues with others, and 9-102(B)(2) (a lawyer shall safeguard a client\u2019s property in the lawyer\u2019s possession) and 1-102(A)(6) in storing, selling, and bartering Steiner\u2019s property. We therefore dismiss those parts of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">Sanction</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">{\u00b6 17} When imposing sanctions for attorney misconduct, we consider all relevant factors, including the duties the lawyer violated, the lawyer\u2019s mental state, and sanctions imposed in similar cases. <em>Stark Cty. Bar Assn. v. Buttacavoli, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 424, 2002-Ohio-4743, 775 N.E.2d 818, \u00b6 16. In making a final determination, we also weigh evidence of the aggravating and mitigating factors listed in Section 10 of the Rules and Regulations Governing Procedure on Complaints and Hearings Before the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline (\u201cBCGD Proc.Reg.\u2019\u2019). <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Broeren, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 473, 2007-Ohio-5251, 875 N.E.2d 935, \u00b6 21. Because each disciplinary case is unique, we are not limited to the factors specified in the rule but may take into account \u201call relevant factors\u201d in determining what sanction to impose. BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">{\u00b6 18} As aggravating factors, we accept the board\u2019s findings that respondent has refused to acknowledge the wrongful nature of his conduct, other than lending his client money, that respondent has failed to make restitution or to help Steiner in retrieving his possessions, and that Steiner was vulnerable and suffered harm. Regarding mitigating factors, the record reflects that the respondent has practiced law for more than 45 years and has no prior disciplinary record. In his efforts to clean up an uninhabitable home and property, respondent acted beyond the scope of his authority; however, the board found that respondent acted in the <em>absence </em>of a dishonest or selfish motive and has had what appears to be an exemplary career. At the hearing before the panel, respondent offered evidence of his good character through 40 letters of reference submitted by people from all walks of life, including attorneys, clients, and members of the community, as well as a common pleas court judge, two judges of the family court, and the Stark County Prosecuting Attorney. He also presented character evidence through the testimony of the Honorable David D. Dowd Jr., a United States district court judge, Judge Sheila Farmer of the Fifth District Court of Appeals, and Richard T. Kettler, retired and formerly of the Massillon Municipal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>Court, all of whom described respondent as having a reputation for honesty, integrity, and good character and as being deserving of the public trust. In addition, the board noted that respondent has fully cooperated with the investigative process, has made full disclosure to the appropriate authorities, and has suffered embarrassment from the accusations of misconduct portrayed in the local media.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">{\u00b6 19} The primary purpose of the disciplinary process is to protect the public from lawyers who are unworthy of the trust and confidence essential to the attorney-client relationship and to allow us to ascertain the lawyer\u2019s fitness to practice law. <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Agopian, </em>112 Ohio St.3d 103, 2006-Ohio-6510, 858 N.E.2d 368, \u00b6 10. While respondent\u2019s unilateral decision to clean up and dispose of Steiner\u2019s property against his client\u2019s known wishes, his misrepresentations to Steiner\u2019s children, which were designed to gain their agreement to his plan of action, his retention of his client\u2019s property, his failure to keep an accurate and complete inventory and to account for Steiner\u2019s personal property during the cleanup, and his failure to acknowledge the wrongfulness of his actions demonstrate that a suspension of his license to practice law for one year is warranted, there is no question that respondent acted in what he perceived to be Steiner\u2019s best interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">{\u00b6 20} In <em>Cleveland Metro. Bar Assn. v. Podor, </em>121 Ohio St.3d 131, 2009-Ohio-358, 902 N.E.2d 488, we imposed a one-year suspension, all stayed on conditions, on an attorney who improperly advanced financial assistance to a client during the course of a representation. Id. at \u00b6 13. In <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Croushore, </em>108 Ohio St.3d 156, 2006-Ohio-412, 841 N.E.2d 781, we imposed a one-year suspension, conditionally stayed, for an attorney\u2019s failure to keep proper records and render a proper accounting of client funds in his possession, as well as his failure to keep those funds in an attorney trust account. Id. at \u00b6 9. In <em>Columbus Bar Assn. v. Halliburton-Cohen </em>(2002), 94 Ohio St.3d 217, 217, 761 N.E.2d 1040, we suspended an attorney for one year, with a conditional stay, for conduct adversely reflecting on her fitness to practice law, failure to keep proper records, and failure to deliver property to which her client was entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">{\u00b6 21} Although \u201c[d]ishonest conduct on the part of an attorney generally warrants an actual suspension from the practice of law,\u201d <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Rooney, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 349, 2006-Ohio-4576, 853 N.E.2d 663, \u00b6 12, this court has previously explained that the type of mitigating evidence introduced in this case can justify imposing a lesser sanction. See <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Agopian, </em>112 Ohio St.3d 103, 2006-Ohio-6510, 858 N.E.2d 368, \u00b6 14 (holding that mitigating evidence demonstrating that Agopian had no prior disciplinary record, had fully cooperated with the disciplinary process, had accepted responsibility for his conduct, and had provided over 40 character references counseled against impos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>ing a greater sanction). We therefore accept the board\u2019s recommendation that respondent\u2019s one-year suspension be stayed on conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">{\u00b6 22} Based on respondent\u2019s conduct and our precedent, respondent is hereby suspended from the practice of law in the state of Ohio for one year, all stayed. As conditions of staying the suspension, respondent is ordered to return forthwith at his cost all of Steiner\u2019s property in his possession, including the decorative stone, pay the costs associated with the retrieval of other items not presently on Steiner\u2019s property, and commit no further disciplinary violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">{\u00b6 23} Costs are taxed to respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b327-8\">Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Donnell, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b327-9\">Moyer, C.J., and O\u2019Connor and Lanzinger, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b327-10\">Moyer, C.J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AlHZ\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-11\">{\u00b6 24} I respectfully dissent from the majority decision with respect to the sanction imposed on respondent. Respondent\u2019s conduct warrants an actual suspension from the practice of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-12\">{\u00b6 25} \u201cDishonest conduct on the part of an attorney generally warrants an actual suspension from the practice of law.\u201d <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Rooney, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 349, 2006-Ohio-4576, 853 N.E.2d 663, \u00b6 12. Respondent made misrepresentations to his client regarding the client\u2019s own property and to his client\u2019s children regarding the client\u2019s mental health. Respondent even threatened the client\u2019s son when the son confronted him. This conduct is in clear violation of DR 1-102(A)(4) (a lawyer shall not engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-13\">{\u00b6 26} Respondent additionally violated four other Disciplinary Rules: DR 1-102(A)(6), 4-101(B)(2), 5-103(B), and 9-102(B)(3). He sold and otherwise disposed of his client\u2019s personal belongings without the client\u2019s knowledge or consent, while the client was in the hospital; he disposed of the client\u2019s assets under the authority of a power of attorney executed by the client but admitted that he knew the client would disapprove of this conduct; he lied to the client\u2019s children in order to gain their consent to his actions; he drafted an inventory of the client\u2019s property that contained several inaccuracies and failed to account for certain items; he never gave any money received from the sale of the client\u2019s property to the client; and he improperly lent money to his client to cover living expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-14\">{\u00b6 27} The cases cited by the majority to support a stayed suspension did not include the totality of the conduct engaged in by respondent, and only <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Agopian, </em>112 Ohio St.3d 103, 2006-Ohio-6510, 858 N.E.2d 368, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>involved a violation of DR 1-102(A)(4). Even <em>Agopian </em>did not appear to involve an act of dishonesty, but rather \u201csloppy record keeping\u201d that resulted in the attorney\u2019s submitting inaccurate fee bills. Id. at \u00b6 11. The sum total of respondent\u2019s actions, including outright dishonesty, should be punished with an actual suspension <em>for one </em>year, with no <em>time </em>stayed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b328-4\">O\u2019Connor and Lanzinger, JJ., concur in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b328-5\">O\u2019Connor, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Ahg\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">{\u00b6 28} I disagree with the majority\u2019s decision to adhere to the recommendation of the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline and impose a one-year suspension, all stayed. Based upon respondent\u2019s conduct and our precedent, I would impose an actual one-year suspension. I therefore dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">{\u00b6 29} As noted by the majority, this court must weigh evidence of the aggravating and mitigating factors listed in Section 10 of the Rules and Regulations Governing Procedure on Complaints and Hearings Before the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline. <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Broeren, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 473, 2007-Ohio-5251, 875 N.E.2d 935, \u00b6 21. When all of the relevant factors for determining what sanction to impose against respondent are weighed, it is clear that an actual suspension is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">{\u00b6 30} I agree with the board\u2019s findings with regard to the mitigating and aggravating factors in this case. However, I disagree with the majority\u2019s treatment of these factors. As to mitigating factors, I agree with the board\u2019s findings that respondent lacked a prior disciplinary record, did not act out of a dishonest or selfish motive, cooperated with the disciplinary process, proved his good character through references, and has suffered embarrassment from the accusations of misconduct portrayed in the local media. Regarding aggravating factors, I agree with the board\u2019s findings that respondent has refused to acknowledge the wrongful nature of his conduct, other than the lending of money to his client, that respondent has failed to make restitution or to help Steiner in retrieving his possessions, and that Steiner was vulnerable and suffered harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-9\">{\u00b6 31} The majority recognizes that the primary purpose of the disciplinary process is to protect the public from lawyers who are unworthy of the trust and confidence essential to the attorney-client relationship and to allow us to ascertain the lawyer\u2019s fitness to practice law. <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Agopian, </em>112 Ohio St.3d 103, 2006-Ohio-6510, 858 N.E.2d 368, \u00b6 10. Yet the majority does not fulfill that purpose because it stays respondent\u2019s suspension. The majority simply excuses respondent\u2019s conduct by holding that he acted in what he perceived to be Steiner\u2019s best interest.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AJc\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>Jonathan Coughlan, Disciplinary Counsel, and Joseph M. Caligiuri, Assistant Disciplinary Counsel, for relator.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b329-8\">Christensen, Christensen, Donchatz, Kettlewell &amp; Owens, Charles J. Kettle-well, and Kenneth R. Donchatz, for respondent.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b329-3\">{\u00b6 32} Although respondent may have acted in what he perceived to be Steiner\u2019s best interests, his unilateral decision to clean up and dispose of Steiner\u2019s property against his client\u2019s known wishes, his misrepresentations to Steiner\u2019s children (which were designed to gain their agreement to his plan of action), his retention of his client\u2019s property, his failure to keep an accurate and complete inventory and to account for Steiner\u2019s personal property during the cleanup, and his failure to acknowledge the wrongfulness of his actions undermine the trust and confidence essential to the attorney-client relationship. All of these factors demonstrate that an actual suspension of his license to practice law for one year is warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\">{\u00b6 33} While respondent may not have acted with a dishonest motive, he engaged in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation in violation of DR 1-102(A)(4). \u201c[D]ishonest conduct on the part of an attorney generally warrants an actual suspension from the practice of law.\u201d <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Rooney, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 349, 2006-Ohio-4576, 853 N.E.2d 663, \u00b6 12, citing <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Beeler, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 188, 2005-Ohio-1143, 824 N.E.2d 78, \u00b6 44, and <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Fowerbaugh </em>(1995), 74 Ohio St.3d 187, 191, 658 N.E.2d 237; see also <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Stollings, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 155, 2006-Ohio-5345, 855 N.E.2d 479, \u00b6 13 (\u201cA violation of DR 1-102(A)(4) ordinarily calls for the actual suspension of an attorney\u2019s license\u201d). The majority acknowledges that respondent\u2019s conduct was dishonest and in violation of DR 1-102(A)(4), yet inexplicably declines to impose an actual suspension. Because of the dishonest nature of respondent\u2019s misconduct, this court\u2019s precedent requires an actual suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">{\u00b6 34} Thus, contrary to the majority holding, I would hold that based on respondent\u2019s conduct and our precedent, respondent\u2019s misconduct warrants an actual suspension.
