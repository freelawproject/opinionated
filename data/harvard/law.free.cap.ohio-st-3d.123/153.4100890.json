McKinney, for a writ of mandamus to compel appellee, Defiance County Court of Common Pleas, to issue findings of fact and conclusions of law on the court\u2019s denial of his petition for postconviction relief. Mandamus will not issue to compel an act that has already been performed. <em>State ex rel. Madsen v. Foley Jones, </em>106 Ohio St.3d 178, 2005-Ohio-4381, 833 N.E.2d 291, \u00b6 11. The common pleas court issued the requisite findings of fact and conclusions of law in February 2005. McKinney had an adequate remedy at law by appeal from that judgment to raise his claim that the common pleas court erred in not reviewing a hearing transcript. And even if McKinney is correct that the clerk did not properly serve notice of the judgment on him, he is not entitled to the requested extraordinary relief in mandamus, because he had adequate remedies in the ordinary course of law by delayed appeal and a motion for relief from judgment to raise this claim. <em>State ex rel.
