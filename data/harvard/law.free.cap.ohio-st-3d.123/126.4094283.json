Because no statute or other pertinent law <em>required </em>the agency to conduct a hearing resembling a judicial trial when it issued its notice to withhold income for spousal support, the agency did not exercise the judicial or quasi-judicial authority required for appellants to be entitled to the requested extraordinary relief in prohibition. See <em>State ex rel. Wright v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Elections, </em>120 Ohio St.3d 92, 2008-Ohio-5553, 896 N.E.2d 706, \u00b6 8. The authorities cited by appellants refer only to discretionary authority to hold hearings. See, e.g., R.C. 5101.37. Insofar as appellants claim that the agency is acting contrary to a trial court order, they have an adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law by way of a motion for contempt in the trial court case. See <em>State ex rel. Weaver v. Ohio Adult Parole Auth., </em>116 Ohio St.3d 340, 2007-Ohio-6435, 879 N.E.2d 191, \u00b6 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-13\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AOc\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>Zukerman, Daiker &amp; Lear Co., L.P.A., Larry W.
