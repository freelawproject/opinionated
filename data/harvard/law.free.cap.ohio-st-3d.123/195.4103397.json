Because the retirement system abused its discretion in withholding these payments, we grant the requested writ of mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-13\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b309-14\">\n<em>Receipt of Retirement Benefits</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b309-15\">{\u00b6 2} In 1978, Richard Watzulik retired from respondent, State Teachers Retirement System of Ohio. Richard selected a joint and survivor annuity with his wife, Violet, as the beneficiary. See R.C. 3307.60(A). Under this plan, Richard would receive a lesser retirement benefit for his lifetime, and upon his death, Violet would receive a benefit for her lifetime. In 1989, after Richard died, Violet began receiving these retirement benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>\n<em>Withholding of Benefits and Decree Declaring Death</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">{\u00b6 3} In March 2000, Violet disappeared. In 2001, a Florida probate court appointed Robert M. Elliott as the plenary guardian of Violet\u2019s property, and he requested that the retirement system forward her retirement-benefit payments to him. The retirement system withheld the payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">{\u00b6 4} In September 2006, a Florida probate court declared Violet deceased pursuant to Fla.Stat. 731.103. Section 3 of this statute provides that a person \u201cwho is absent from the place of his of her last known domicile for a continuous period of 5 years and whose absence is not satisfactorily explained after diligent search and inquiry is presumed dead.\u201d This provision is comparable to R.C. 2121.01(A)(1), which provides that, in general, a presumption of death exists \u201c[w]hen the person has disappeared and been continuously absent from his place of last domicile for a five-year period without being heard from during the period.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">\n<em>Request for the Payment of Benefits to the Estate</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">{\u00b6 5} In January 2007, the retirement system, being notified of the presumption of Violet\u2019s death, advised Elliott that Violet had been \u201centitled to benefits in the amount of $152,774.10 for the months of March 2001 through September 2006,\u201d and \u201c[s]ince these funds were not issued prior to [Violet\u2019s] death, [her children] Eileen Mager and Carl Richard Watzulik are entitled to these funds as beneficiaries.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b310-9\">{\u00b6 6} Later that year, however, the retirement system changed its position and advised Elliott that it would not pay Violet\u2019s estate any of the withheld benefit payments because \u201c[a]bsent proof that Violet Watzulik was in fact alive during the period that her benefits were held, [the retirement system] is not authorized to issue any further benefits from the account.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b310-10\">{\u00b6 7} The Florida probate court appointed relator, Eileen Mager, Violet\u2019s daughter, as the decedent\u2019s estate\u2019s personal representative. Mager requested that the retirement system pay to the estate the withheld retirement-benefit payments, but the retirement system refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-11\">\n<em>Florida Case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b310-12\">{\u00b6 8} In February 2008, Mager filed an action in a Florida court seeking to recover the withheld payments from the retirement system. The retirement system filed a motion to dismiss the case because Mager\u2019s remedy was by way of an action for a writ of mandamus in this court. Mager subsequently dismissed the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>\n<em>Mandamus Case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">{\u00b6 9} In February 2009, Mager filed this action for a writ of mandamus to compel the retirement system to pay her mother\u2019s estate the retirement-benefit payments due from the March 2001 date that the system withheld payment until the September 2006 date of the Florida decree declaring Violet deceased. After the retirement system filed an answer and a motion for judgment on the pleadings, the court granted an alternative writ, and the parties submitted evidence and briefs. <em>State ex rel. Mager v. State Teachers Retirement Sys. of Ohio, </em>121 Ohio St.3d 1496, 2009-Ohio-2511, 907 N.E.2d 321.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">{\u00b6 10} This cause is now before the court for our consideration of the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">Legal Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">\n<em>Mandamus to Correct an Administrative Abuse of Discretion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b311-9\">{\u00b6 11} Mager requests a writ of mandamus to compel the retirement system to pay her mother\u2019s estate the retirement benefits it withheld during the time her mother was missing before being declared dead. \u201c[M]andamus is an appropriate remedy where no statutory right of appeal is available to correct an abuse of discretion by an administrative body.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Pipoly v. State Teachers Retirement Sys., </em>95 Ohio St.3d 327, 2002-Ohio-2219, 767 N.E.2d 719, \u00b6 14. Because there is no statutory right of appeal from the retirement system\u2019s determination that Violet\u2019s estate is not entitled to the sums collected in her retirement account between her disappearance and declaration of death, mandamus is an appropriate remedy. Cf. <em>State ex rel. Shisler v. Ohio Pub. Emps. Retirement Sys., </em>122 Ohio St.3d 148, 2009-Ohio-2522, 909 N.E.2d 610, \u00b6 11. To prove an abuse of discretion, Mager must establish that the retirement system\u2019s decision was unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable. See <em>State ex rel. Schachter v. Ohio Pub. Emps. Retirement Bd., </em>121 Ohio St.3d 526, 2009-Ohio-1704, 905 N.E.2d 1210, \u00b6 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-10\">\n<em>R.C. 2121.04</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b311-11\">{\u00b6 12} As her husband\u2019s beneficiary, Violet began receiving retirement benefits pursuant to R.C. 3307.60. Upon notice of her disappearance, the retirement system withheld payments. When this disappearance met the requirements under Florida\u2019s presumed decedents\u2019 provisions, she was declared dead by the Florida probate court. See Fla.Stat. 731.103(3); R.C. 2121.01(A)(1). Under R.C. 2121.04(A), \u201c[i]f satisfied that a presumption of death has been established, as provided in section 2121.01 of the Revised Code, the probate court shall so decree.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b311-12\">{\u00b6 13} This case involves the effect of the death decree. R.C. 2121.04(B) provides, \u201cThe death of such presumed decedent <em>shall for all purposes under the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number><em>law of this state </em>be regarded as having occurred as of the date of such decree.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">{\u00b6 14} In construing this statute, \u201cour paramount concern is the legislative intent\u201d in enacting it. <em>State ex rel. Steele v. Morrissey, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 355, 2004-Ohio-4960, 815 N.E.2d 1107, \u00b6 21. To discern this intent, we must \u201cread words and phrases in context according to the rules of grammar and common usage.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Lee v. Karnes, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 559, 2004-Ohio-5718, 817 N.E.2d 76, \u00b6 23; <em>Gross v. FBL Fin. Servs., Inc. </em>(2009), - U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 2343, 2350, 174 L.Ed.2d 119, quoting <em>Engine Mfrs. Assn. v. S. Coast Air Quality Mgt. Dist. </em>(2004), 541 U.S. 246, 252, 124 S.Ct. 1756, 158 L.Ed.2d 529 (\u201c \u2018Statutory construction must begin with the language employed by Congress and the assumption that the ordinary meaning of that language accurately expresses the legislative purpose\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cAll\u201d means \u201cevery\u201d or \u201cany whatever,\u201d and \u201cpurpose\u201d means \u201c[a]n objective, goal, or end.\u201d See Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (9th Ed.2009) 1356; Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (2002) 54.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-9\">{\u00b6 16} Because R.C. 2121.04(B) is phrased in broad, sweeping language, we must accord it broad, sweeping application. <em>State ex rel. Colvin v. Brunner, </em>120 Ohio St.3d 110, 2008-Ohio-5041, 896 N.E.2d 979, \u00b6 49; <em>State ex rel. Ohio Democratic Party v. Blackwell, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 246, 2006-Ohio-5202, 855 N.E.2d 1188, \u00b6 14, quoting <em>Consumer Electronics Assn. v. Fed. Communications Comm. </em>(C.A.D.C.2003), 347 F.3d 291, 298 (\u201cAs United States Supreme Court Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. previously observed in a unanimous opinion for the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, \u2018the Supreme Court has consistently instructed that statutes written in broad, sweeping language should be given broad, sweeping application\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-10\">{\u00b6 17} Manifestly, the plain language of R.C. 2121.04(B) dictates that the decedent was alive as a matter of law until September 2006, when she was declared dead by the Florida probate court. The determination of when the decedent was alive and thus entitled to retirement benefits is certainly a \u201cpurpose\u201d under state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-11\">\n<em>State ex rel. Hammond v. Pub. Emps. Retirement Sys.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b312-12\">{\u00b6 18} The retirement system argues that our decision in <em>State ex rel. Hammond v. Pub. Emps. Retirement Sys. </em>(1972), 29 Ohio St.2d 192, 58 O.O.2d 403, 280 N.E.2d 904, requires a contrary result.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-13\">{\u00b6 19} In <em>Hammond, </em>we denied a writ of mandamus to compel the Public Employees Retirement System to pay benefits to a retiree\u2019s trustee after the retiree\u2019s disappearance. In so holding, we construed a previous version of R.C. 2121.04, which provided:</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>{\u00b6 20} \u201cIf satisfied, upon such hearing [in the probate court], that the legal presumption of death is made out, the court shall so decree, and the presumption of death shall be regarded as having arisen as of the date of such decree.\u201d G.C. 10509-28, 114 Ohio Laws, Part I, 407.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">{\u00b6 21} In our five-to-two decision in <em>Hammond, </em>we reasoned that the presumption arising under the former version of R.C. 2121.04 was for \u201ccertain purposes,\u201d and therefore, the presumption could not establish the existence of actual life before the decreed death:</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">{\u00b6 22} \u201cMarjorie Hammond\u2019s right to receive payments from the respondent is a personal right, continuing only during her actual lifetime. Although for certain purposes, the Presumed Decedents\u2019 Act provides that the \u2018presumption of death shall be regarded as having arisen as of the date of such decree\u2019 (R.C. 2121.04), such \u2018presumption\u2019 does not prove the existence of actual life prior to the decree, so as to enable a third person to receive property through or on behalf of the \u2018missing\u2019 person.\u201d <em>Hammond, </em>29 Ohio St.2d at 194, 58 O.O.2d 403, 280 N.E.2d 904.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">{\u00b6 23} In assessing the impact of the current amendment to R.C. 2121.04, which became effective two years after our decision in <em>Hammond, </em>\u201c[w]e must presume that the General Assembly knew of our decision\u201d when it repealed the former version that we interpreted in that case. <em>State v. Ferguson, </em>120 Ohio St.3d 7, 2008-Ohio-4824, 896 N.E.2d 110, \u00b6 22. \u201c \u2018When an existing statute is repealed and a new statute upon the same subject is enacted to include an amendment, as in this case, it is presumed that the Legislature intended to change the effect and operation of the law to the extent of the change in the language thereof.\u2019 \u201d <em>Greenville Law Library Assn. v. Ansonia </em>(1973), 33 Ohio St.2d 3, 6, 62 O.O.2d 169, 292 N.E.2d 880, quoting <em>Malone v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1942), 140 Ohio St. 292, 299, 23 O.O. 496, 43 N.E.2d 266.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">{\u00b6 24} By repealing the previous version of R.C. 2121.04(B) and specifying in the amended version that the date of the probate court decree declaring the presumed decedent\u2019s death shall be regarded as the date of death \u201cfor all purposes under the law of the state\u201d and not simply for the \u201ccertain purposes\u201d noted in <em>Hammond, </em>it is evident that the General Assembly, in effect, legislatively overruled our holding in <em>Hammond.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b313-9\">{\u00b6 25} Therefore, <em>Hammond </em>is not controlling in our interpretation of the current version of R.C. 2121.04.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-10\">\n<em>Liberal Construction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b313-11\">{\u00b6 26} Finally, even if we were to hold that the statute is ambiguous, this interpretation of R.C. 2121.04(B) is consistent with the axiom that we must read pension statutes \u201cliberally in favor of the interests of the public employees and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>their dependents that the pension statutes were designed to protect.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Solomon v. Police &amp; Firemen\u2019s Disability &amp; Pension Fund </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 62, 65, 647 N.E.2d 486; <em>State ex rel. Moss v. Ohio State Hwy. Patrol Retirement Sys., </em>97 Ohio St.3d 198, 2002-Ohio-5806, 777 N.E.2d 259, \u00b6 21. The retirement system\u2019s advocated construction of R.C. 2121.04(B) does not advance these interests.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AOY\">Davis Island Law, P.A., and Jeffrey A. Blau; and Hohmann, Boukis, &amp; Curtis, P.A., and Kenneth Boukis, for relator.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b314-9\">Richard Cordray, Attorney General, and John E. Patterson, Assistant Attorney General, for respondent.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">{\u00b6 27} Based on the foregoing, Mager has established that the retirement system acted in an unreasonable, arbitrary, and unconscionable manner by ignoring the plain language of R.C. 2121.04(B) and withholding the retirement benefits from the decedent\u2019s personal representative when she was entitled to them under R.C. 3307.60. Therefore, we grant a writ of mandamus to compel the retirement system to pay Mager the retirement benefits withheld from the decedent from the time she disappeared until the date she was declared dead by the Florida probate court.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">Writ granted.</p>\n<judges id=\"b314-7\">Moyer, C.J., and Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
