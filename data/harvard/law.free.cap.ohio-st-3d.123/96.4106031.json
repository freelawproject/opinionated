Gessner, for a writ of mandamus to compel appellees, the sheriff-elect and the acting sheriff of Montgomery County, to provide him with due process of law for a June 2008 notice against trespass issued to him, barring him from specified courthouses.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-16\">{\u00b6 <em>2} </em>For the following reasons, the court of appeals properly dismissed Gessner\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-17\">{\u00b6 3} First, Gessner had an adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law by way of an action under Section 1983, Title 42, U.S.Code, to raise his federal constitutional claims. <em>State ex rel. Mackey v. Blackwell, </em>106 Ohio St.3d 261, 2005-Ohio-4789, 834 N.E.2d 346, \u00b6 21. He could have filed this action in common <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>pleas court and joined any state-law claims. See <em>State ex rel. Kreps v. Christiansen </em>(2000), 88 Ohio St.3d 313, 317-318, 725 N.E.2d 663.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Ahr\">Mark E. Gessner, pro se.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b211-10\">Mathias H. Heck Jr., Montgomery County Prosecuting Attorney, and John A. Cumming, Assistant Prosecuting Attorney, for appellees.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">{\u00b6 4} Second, Gessner cites no statute imposing any legal duty on appellees. \u201cIt is axiomatic that in mandamus proceedings, the creation of the legal duty that a relator seeks to enforce is the distinct function of the legislative branch of government, and courts are not authorized to create the legal duty.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Pipoly v. State Teachers Retirement Sys., </em>95 Ohio St.3d 327, 2002-Ohio-2219, 767 N.E.2d 719, \u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">{\u00b6 5} Finally, notwithstanding Gessner\u2019s argument to the contrary, pro se litigants like him must follow the same procedures as litigants represented by counsel. <em>State ex rel. Fuller v. Mengel, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 352, 2003-Ohio-6448, 800 N.E.2d 25, \u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">{\u00b6 6} Therefore, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals dismissing Gessner\u2019s mandamus petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b211-8\">Moyer, C.J., and Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
