Hughley\u2019s petition was fatally defective and subject to dismissal because he failed to comply with the commitment-paper and verification requirements of R.C. 2725.04. <em>Griffin v. McFaul, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 30, 2007-Ohio-5506, 876 N.E.2d 527, \u00b64. Hughley\u2019s petition failed to include specific facts to support his statement that his commitment papers and verification could not be obtained without impairing the efficiency of the remedy. <em>Goudlock v. Voorhies, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 398, 2008-Ohio-4787, 894 N.E.2d 692, \u00b6 15. Even if \u2014 as Hughley claims \u2014 the prison\u2019s record office would not give him a copy of his commitment papers, there is no allegation in his petition that he sought those papers from the clerk\u2019s office of his sentencing court. And although Hughley\u2019s petition contains an \u201caffidavit on claims\u201d that is notarized, there is no statement in which he expressly swears to the truth of the allegations in his petition. <em>Chari v. Vore </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 323, 327, 744 N.E.2d 763.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-13\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b204-14\">Moyer, C.J., and Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<attorneys id=\"ASx\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>Richard Cordray, Attorney General, and M.
