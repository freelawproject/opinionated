Sabroff, Attorney Registration No. 0018933, with a registration address in Mayfield Heights, Ohio, was admitted to the practice of law in Ohio in 1977. The Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline has recommended that this court permanently disbar respondent, based on findings that he misappropriated clients\u2019 funds, settled a client\u2019s claim without her consent, failed to maintain all client funds in an attorney trust account, commingled client and personal funds in his trust account, practiced law while under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>suspension, and failed to cooperate in the efforts to investigate his misconduct. We agree that respondent committed professional misconduct as found by the board and that permanent disbarment is the appropriate sanction for his misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">{\u00b6 2} Relator, Disciplinary Counsel, charged respondent with violations of the Disciplinary Rules of the Code of Professional Responsibility, the Rules of Professional Conduct, the Gov.Bar R. V(4)(G) requirement that attorneys cooperate in investigations of misconduct, and the duties of a suspended attorney specified in Gov.Bar R. V(8)(E). When service could not be perfected at the address on file for respondent with the Office of Attorney Services or at a last known address, the board served the complaint on the Clerk of the Supreme Court pursuant to Gov.Bar R. V(11)(B) (providing that the Clerk is the agent for service of process when the whereabouts of Ohio lawyers are unknown). Respondent failed to answer the complaint, and pursuant to Gov.Bar R. V(6)(F), relator moved for default. A master commissioner appointed by the board granted the motion, making findings of fact, conclusions of law, and the recommendation that respondent be permanently disbarred. The board adopted the master commissioner\u2019s findings of misconduct, conclusions of law, and recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\"><em>Count I </em>\u2014 The <em>Sebolds\u2019 Grievance</em></p>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">{\u00b6 3} In July 2001, Mikki and Mark Sebold engaged respondent to represent them in their personal-injury claims arising from an automobile accident. On respondent\u2019s recommendation, the Sebolds received treatment for their injuries from Dr. Albert Musca. Respondent settled their claims and presented the Sebolds with a settlement statement reflecting that he had withheld part of their share to pay Dr. Musca for their medical treatment. However, respondent did not pay the Sebolds\u2019 medical bills, nor did he retain these funds for their benefit in his attorney trust account. In January 2007, the Sebolds received collection notices for their unpaid medical bills, and respondent informed them that he had signed an agreement with Dr. Musca to be responsible for the medical bills. Respondent could not produce a copy of this agreement, did not pay Dr. Musca, and did not reimburse the Sebolds.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-9\">{\u00b6 4} We accept the board\u2019s findings that respondent misappropriated the Sebolds\u2019 funds and violated DR 1-102(A)(4) (prohibiting conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation), 1-102(A)(5) (prohibiting conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice), 1-102(A)(6) (prohibiting conduct that adversely reflects on the lawyer\u2019s fitness to practice law), 9-102(B)(3) (requiring a lawyer to maintain complete records and appropriate accounts), and 9-102(B)(4) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>(requiring a lawyer to promptly pay or deliver funds in the lawyer\u2019s possession to which the client is entitled).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\"><em>Count II </em>\u2014 Failure <em>to Cooperate</em></p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">{\u00b6 5} In September 2007, relator sent a letter of inquiry to the respondent regarding the Sebolds\u2019 allegations. Although respondent signed the certified mail return receipt, he did not respond to relator\u2019s inquiry. In November 2007, relator sent a second letter of inquiry to respondent. Respondent provided a response to the second letter of inquiry, but he failed to address fully the specific allegations in the Sebolds\u2019 grievance. In April 2008, relator subpoenaed respondent to appear for a deposition at relator\u2019s office in Columbus, Ohio. At respondent\u2019s request, relator rescheduled the deposition for 9:00 a.m. on June 19, 2008, in Cleveland, Ohio, based on respondent\u2019s assertion that he could not physically travel to Columbus. At 7:46 a.m. on the day of the deposition, respondent left a telephone message at relator\u2019s office in Columbus explaining that he had suffered a physical injury that morning that prevented his appearance at the deposition. Relator and respondent agreed that respondent would contact relator when he had sufficiently recovered to sit for the deposition. Respondent failed to reschedule the deposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">{\u00b6 6} We accept the board\u2019s findings that respondent violated Prof.Cond.R. 8.4(d) (prohibiting conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice) and 8.4(h) (prohibiting conduct that adversely reflects on the lawyer\u2019s fitness to practice law) and Gov .Bar R. V(4)(G).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-8\"><em>Count III </em>\u2014 The <em>Forgus Grievance</em></p>\n<p id=\"b298-9\">{\u00b6 7} In August 2002, Erica Forgus hired respondent to represent her in a personal-injury claim resulting from an automobile accident in Ohio. At the time, Forgus resided in Illinois, but in June 2004, she moved to Switzerland. Respondent filed a complaint on her behalf in the Portage County Court of Common Pleas in 2003, but in September 2005, the month before trial, he decided to voluntarily dismiss the complaint. Although he wrote Forgus a letter and left her a telephone message seeking her input, he nonetheless voluntarily dismissed the complaint without waiting for her response or her consent. At that point, Forgus had already purchased a transatlantic plane ticket so that she could appear at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-10\">{\u00b6 8} Fifteen days later, respondent received a settlement offer and contacted Forgus, recommending that she accept it. Forgus did not accept the offer at that time and told respondent that they would discuss it further when she arrived in Ohio the following week. Contrary to her directive, respondent accepted the settlement offer. Further, he forged Forgus\u2019s name on the settlement check, and on October 4, 2005, he deposited the funds into his attorney trust account. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>Respondent then prepared a settlement statement reflecting his 40 percent contingency fee of $7,000, expenses in the amount of $1,511.26, and a disbursement of $9,000 to Forgus. After he arrived two and one-half hours late for a meeting scheduled with Forgus and argued with her, she refused to sign the settlement statement. Respondent subsequently mailed a check for $9,000 to Forgus at her parents\u2019 address. After he realized that he had failed to deduct funds to pay her medical expenses from her share of the settlement, respondent stopped payment on the check on November 17, 2005, promising to issue a new one after he had paid her medical bills. Records from respondent\u2019s attorney trust account show that it often had a balance of less than $9,000 during the time respondent retained Forgus\u2019s money.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">{\u00b6 9} After hearing nothing from respondent, Forgus contacted the Beachwood Police Department, which launched a criminal investigation. Respondent pleaded guilty to one count of theft as a fifth-degree felony and paid restitution to Forgus in April 2007 as a condition of his agreement to plead to a reduced charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">{\u00b6 10} We accept the board\u2019s findings that respondent misappropriated Forgus\u2019s money and violated DR 1 \u2014 102(A)(4), 1 \u2014 102(A)(5), 1 \u2014 102(A)(6), T \u2014 101(A)(3) (prohibiting a lawyer from prejudicing or damaging his client during the course of the professional relationship), 9-102(B)(3), and 9-102(B)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\"><em>Count TV </em>\u2014 Felony <em>Conviction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">{\u00b6 11} On November 1, 2006, the state of Ohio indicted respondent on fourth-degree-felony charges of theft, forgery, and uttering a forged document based on his forging Forgus\u2019s signature on her settlement check, cashing it, and misappropriating those funds. The court set the case for trial on April 9, 2007, but respondent arrived late. After the jury had been impaneled, the parties negotiated a plea agreement. The state amended the complaint to charge respondent with one count of theft as a felony of the fifth degree. Respondent pleaded guilty to that charge, and the court dismissed the forgery and uttering charges. The court delayed sentencing for a month and ordered respondent to pay restitution of almost $12,000 in four days.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-9\">{\u00b6 12} At his sentencing hearing, respondent admitting using cocaine and marijuana after his plea hearing, resulting in his failing a court-ordered drug test. He also admitted paying the restitution late. The court sentenced respondent to community control, in-patient drug treatment, and community service. In addition, the court ordered respondent not to practice law.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-10\">{\u00b6 13} We accept the board\u2019s findings that respondent violated Prof.Cond.R. 8.4(b) (prohibiting a lawyer from committing an illegal act that reflects adversely on the lawyer\u2019s honesty or trustworthiness), 8.4(c) (prohibiting conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation), 8.4(d), and 8.4(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number><em>Count V </em>\u2014 Practicing <em>Law while under Suspension</em></p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">{\u00b6 14} On October 23, 2007, this court imposed an interim suspension on respondent following his felony conviction for theft. <em>In re Sabroff, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 1435, 2007-Ohio-5636, 875 N.E.2d 98. Notwithstanding his suspension from the practice of law, less than a month later, respondent sent a letter to the Cleveland Heights Municipal Court on behalf of his son, who had been charged with a traffic violation. Respondent used letterhead referring to himself as \u201cAttorney and Counselor at Law,\u201d and in the letter, he entered a plea of not guilty, waived all statutory time requirements, and sought the scheduling of a pretrial hearing. After relator apparently contacted respondent inquiring whether he had practiced law with a suspended license, respondent sent a letter to the municipal court explaining that he had \u201cdecided to withdraw as counsel\u201d for his son because of \u201ca plethora of physical problems.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">{\u00b6 15} We accept the board\u2019s finding that respondent violated Prof.Cond.R. 5.5(a) (prohibiting a lawyer from practicing law in a jurisdiction in violation of the regulation of the legal profession in that jurisdiction) and Gov.Bar R. V(8)(E) (requiring a lawyer to notify opposing counsel and the court of his disqualification to practice law).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\"><em>Count VI </em>\u2014 Commingling <em>Client and Personal Funds</em></p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">{\u00b6 16} Between December 1, 2004, and February 28, 2006, respondent maintained an attorney trust account at Huntington National Bank and used it to pay his cable, credit card, telephone, and electric bills, insurance premiums, college tuition, and his attorney registration fee, and he wrote numerous checks out of this account made payable to \u201cCash.\u201d The words \u201cIOLTA [Interest on Lawyers\u2019 Trust Accounts] ACCOUNT\u201d appear on the front of the checks in bold letters. During this same time period, respondent deposited checks received for settling the personal-injury claims of clients into this same account.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-9\">{\u00b6 17} We accept the board\u2019s finding that respondent violated DR 1-102(A)(4), 1-102(A)(6), and 9-102(A) (requiring all funds of clients paid to a lawyer to be deposited in one or more identifiable bank accounts containing no funds belonging to the lawyer).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-10\">Sanction</p>\n<p id=\"b300-11\">{\u00b6 18} When imposing sanctions for attorney misconduct, we consider a number of factors, including the duties the lawyer violated, the lawyer\u2019s mental state, and sanctions imposed in similar cases. <em>Stark Cty. Bar Assn. v. Buttacavoli, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 424, 2002-Ohio-4743, 775 N.E.2d 818, \u00b6 16. In making a final determination, we also weigh evidence of the aggravating and mitigating factors listed in Section 10 of the Rules and Regulations Governing Procedure on Complaints and Hearings Before the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>Discipline (\u201cBCGD Proc.Reg.\u201d). <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Broeren, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 473, 2007-Ohio-5251, 875 N.E.2d 935, \u00b6 21. Because each disciplinary case is unique, we are not limited to the factors specified in the rule but may take into account \u201call relevant factors\u201d in determining what sanction to impose. BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\">{\u00b6 19} Respondent\u2019s failure to cooperate in the investigatory process prevents us from determining whether his health issues and chemical dependency mitigate his misconduct. See BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(2)(g). Regarding aggravating factors, we accept the board\u2019s findings that respondent acted with a dishonest or selfish motive, engaged in a pattern of misconduct, committed multiple offenses, failed to cooperate in the disciplinary process, and refused to acknowledge the wrongful nature of his conduct. BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(1)(b), (c), (d), and (e). We also accept the finding that respondent has not made restitution to the Sebolds for the funds stolen from them and that he paid restitution to Forgus only after being ordered to do so as a condition of his plea agreement. BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(1)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">{\u00b6 20} The primary purpose of the disciplinary process is to protect the public from lawyers who are unworthy of the trust and confidence essential to the attorney-client relationship and to allow us to ascertain the lawyer\u2019s fitness to practice law. <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Agopian, 112 </em>Ohio St.3d 103, 2006-Ohio-6510, 858 N.E.2d 368, \u00b6 10. Respondent\u2019s misappropriation of his clients\u2019 funds, his felony conviction, his dishonesty, his settlement of a personal-injury claim against the express instructions of his client, his forgery of a client\u2019s signature on the settlement check, his practice of law with a suspended license, his failure to notify the municipal court of his disqualification from practice, his commingling of personal and client funds, his engagement in a pattern of misconduct, and his failure to cooperate in the disciplinary process demonstrate that he is no longer fit to practice law.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">{\u00b6 21} We have previously explained that \u201cmisappropriation of client funds carrie[s] a \u2018presumptive sanction of disbarment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Trumbull Cty. Bar Assn. v. Kafantaris, 121 </em>Ohio St.3d 387, 2009-Ohio-1389, 904 N.E.2d 875, \u00b6 14, quoting <em>Cleveland Bar Assn. v. Dixon, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 490, 2002-Ohio-2490, 769 N.E.2d 816, \u00b6 15. Similarly, \u201c \u2018permanent disbarment is an appropriate sanction for conduct that violates DR 1-102 and results in a felony conviction.\u2019 \u201d <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Stern, </em>106 Ohio St.3d 266, 2005-Ohio-4804, 834 N.E.2d 351, \u00b6 8, quoting <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Gallagher </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 51, 52, 693 N.E.2d 1078. Further, \u201c \u2018[t]he normal penalty for continuing to practice law while under suspension is disbarment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Frazier, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 288, 2006-Ohio-4481, 853 N.E.2d 295, \u00b6 54, quoting <em>Disciplinary Counsel v.
