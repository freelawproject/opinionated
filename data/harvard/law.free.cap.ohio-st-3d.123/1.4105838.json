We conclude that ERAC has jurisdiction to entertain such an appeal if the letter is a final decision that substantially affects the applicant\u2019s property or other legal rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-13\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b115-14\">{\u00b6 <em>2} </em>In May 2004, appellee, Trans Rail America, Inc. (\u201cTrans Rail\u201d), applied to the Trumbull County Health Department for a license to establish a facility for disposal of construction and demolition debris (\u201cC &amp; DD\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In July 2004, Dr. James Enyeart, Trumbull County health commissioner, advised Trans Rail by letter that he could not consider the application because it was incomplete, and he informed Trans Rail of the incomplete aspects of its application. On July 29, 2004, representatives of Trans Rail (CT Consultants, an engineering firm) met with Enyeart to discuss the application. A year and a half later, on December 16, 2005, Enyeart received from CT Consultants Trans Rail\u2019s written response to Enyeart\u2019s letter, including additional information to support the license application.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>{\u00b6 3} Enyeart again determined that the application was incomplete and so notified Trans Rail in a letter dated February 15, 2006. Attached to the letter was a detailed report outlining additional information that Enyeart (through the health department\u2019s consulting firm, Bennett and Williams Environmental Consultants, Inc.) had determined was necessary for the application to be considered on the merits. Most of the information requested related to the previously identified areas in which Enyeart had found the application incomplete in July 2004, although some of the items identified as incomplete were explained in further detail. CT Consultants and HzW Environmental Consultants responded on behalf of Trans Rail in letters dated March 30, 2006. Those letters included some additional or corrected information in support of the C &amp; DD license application and, in some cases, an explanation of where the requested information could be found in the original application. Some responses indicated that Trans Rail did not believe that the information was required, at least not at the initial licensure stage. (Neither of those letters indicated specifically that Trans Rail had no further information to provide other than what was in the March 30 letters.) In the March 30 letter of CT Consultants, Trans Rail urged Enyeart to reconsider his decision that the application was incomplete. Despite the information Trans Rail submitted on March 30, Enyeart in a letter dated May 31, 2006, again determined that Trans Rail\u2019s application was incomplete and outlined the additional information still needed to complete the application. The May 31 letter did not raise new areas of information that the director requested, but instead related to areas identified in the February 2006 letter and report from Enyeart. Many of the comments in Enyeart\u2019s consultant\u2019s May 31, 2006 letter to him indicated that Trans Rail\u2019s responses to date had not answered the questions Enyeart and his consultant had asked. In other areas, the letter indicated that Enyeart\u2019s earlier comments had been addressed. The letter from Enyeart\u2019s consultant ended with a recommendation that \u201cthe Health District offer to meet with the Applicant to discuss the new comments, if appropriate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">{\u00b6 4} On June 30, 2006, Trans Rail filed an appeal to ERAC of Enyeart\u2019s May 31, 2006 letter. Trans Rail sought an order from ERAC determining that Trans Rail\u2019s license application was complete within the meaning of Ohio Adm.Code 3745-37-02 and ordering the department \u201cto process Trans Rail\u2019s C <em>&amp; </em>DD License Application.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">{\u00b6 5} Enyeart moved to dismiss Trans Rail\u2019s appeal, asserting that ERAC lacked jurisdiction because the May 31, 2006 letter was not a final act or action of the department appealable under R.C. 3745.04. ERAC dismissed the appeal. ERAC determined that the letter was not a final, appealable action but an intermediate step in the continuing application process.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>{\u00b6 6} Trans Rail appealed to the Tenth District Court of Appeals. The court reversed ERAC\u2019s order, reasoning that ERAC has appellate jurisdiction under R.C. 3745.04(B) \u201cto consider whether the application is complete and, if it is,\u201d to order the department to either issue or deny Trans Rail a license. <em>Trans Rail Am., Inc. v. Enyeart, </em>10th Dist. Nos. 07AP-273 and 07AP-284, 2007-Ohio-7144, 2007 WL 4564303, \u00b6 10. The appellate court held that it was not necessary to consider whether Enyeart\u2019s May 31, 2006 letter constituted a final \u201caction\u201d of the board of health, because ERAC\u2019s authority under R.C. 3745.04(B) to order the performance of an \u201cact\u201d was separate from, and did not depend on, ERAC\u2019s authority under that statute to \u201cvacat[e] or modify! ] the action of the director or a local board of health.\u201d Id, \u00b6 11. The dissenting judge on the court of appeals would have held that ERAC\u2019s statutory authority to order the performance of an \u201cact\u201d was limited to ordering relief in furtherance of its determination of an appeal from a final action of a director or a board of health. Id. at \u00b6 21, 30, and 32 (French, J, dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">{\u00b6 7} Enyeart sought discretionary review in this court, asserting that R.C. 3745.04(B) authorizes ERAC to review only final actions of the director or a board of health and that letters requesting additional information from license applicants are not final actions and therefore not appealable to ERAC. We accepted the appeal. 118 Ohio St.3d 1432, 2008-Ohio-2595, 887 N.E.2d 1202.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">{\u00b6 8} The answer to the question presented for our review depends upon the proper construction of R.C. 3745.04, which authorizes appeals of certain orders to ERAC. That statute provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b117-8\">{\u00b6 9} \u201c(A) * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b117-9\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cAs used in this section, <em>action or act includes </em>the adoption, modification, or repeal of a rule or standard, the issuance, modification, or revocation of any lawful order other than an emergency order, and the issuance, denial, modification, or revocation of a license, permit, lease, variance, or certificate, or the approval or disapproval of plans and specifications pursuant to law or rules adopted thereunder.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-10\">{\u00b6 11} \u201c(B) Any person who was a party to a proceeding before the director of environmental protection may participate in an appeal to the environmental review appeals commission <em>for an order vacating or modifying the action of the director or a local board of health, or ordering the director or board of health to perform an act. </em>The environmental review appeals commission has exclusive original jurisdiction over any matter that may, under this section, be brought before it. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b117-11\">{\u00b6 12} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b118-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>{\u00b6 13} \u201c(D) An appeal shall be in writing and shall set forth the <em>action </em>complained of and the grounds upon which the appeal is based.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cThe appeal shall be filed with the commission <em>within thirty days after notice of the action. </em>* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">{\u00b6 15} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">{\u00b6 16} \u201cWithin seven days after receipt of the notice of an appeal filed under division (B) of this section, the director or local board of health, as applicable, shall prepare and certify to the commission a record of the proceedings out of which the appeal arises, including all documents and correspondence, and a transcript of all testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">{\u00b6 17} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cThe filing of an appeal does not automatically suspend or stay execution of <em>the action appealed from. </em>Upon application by the appellant, the commission may suspend or stay the execution pending immediate determination of the appeal * * *.\" (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b118-9\">\n<em>A</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b118-10\">{\u00b6 19} The court of appeals determined that the phrase \u201cor ordering the director or board of health to perform an act\u201d in R.C. 3745.04(B) sets forth a separate basis for ERAC\u2019s appellate jurisdiction in addition to review of final actions of the board. 2007-Ohio-7144, 2007 WL 4564303, \u00b6 11. The appellate court held that \u201cthe statute invests the ERAC with jurisdiction over two types of appeals: (1) an appeal from an \u2018action\u2019 that the ERAC may vacate or modify, and (2) an appeal requesting that the ERAC order the performance of an \u2018act.\u2019 \u201d Id., \u00b6 9. The court concluded that because R.C. 3745.04(A) defines \u201caction\u201d and \u201cact\u201d to include \u201cthe issuance, denial, modification, or revocation of a license,\u201d R.C. 3745.04(B) authorizes ERAC to order the department to perform the act of issuing or denying the license Trans Rail requested if ERAC first determines that Trans Rail\u2019s license application is complete. Id. at \u00b6 9, 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-11\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b118-12\">{\u00b6 20} We are not persuaded that R.C. 3745.04 can be read as providing an independent basis for ERAC to exercise appellate jurisdiction over a nonfinal decision of a board of health or the director. R.C. 3745.04(B) provides for appeals to ERAC \u201cfor an order vacating or modifying the action of the director or a local board of health, or ordering the director or board of health to perform an act.\u201d R.C. 3745.04(A) defines both \u201caction\u201d and \u201cact\u201d to include \u201cthe issuance, modification, or revocation of any lawful order other than an emergency order, and the issuance, denial, modification, or revocation of a license, permit, lease, variance, or certificate,\u201d among other matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>{\u00b6 21} R.C. 3745.04(D) contemplates that a definite and identifiable action will give rise to an appeal to ERAC. R.C. 3745.04(D) requires appeals to ERAC to \u201cset forth the <em>action </em>complained of.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Appeals to ERAC must be filed within 30 days \u201cafter notice of the <em>action.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) R.C. 3745.04(D). Compilation of the \u201crecord of the proceedings out of which the appeal arises,\u201d including a \u201ctranscript of all testimony,\u201d under R.C. 3745.04(D), also presupposes an appeal from a decision that is in some sense final. The availability of a stay of \u201cthe action appealed from,\u201d in R.C. 3745.04(D), also assumes that the action is not an intermediary step in an ongoing, yet-to-be-concluded process.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">{\u00b6 22} The statutory scheme gives the director (or, in this case, the local board of health) the role of initial review and determination of license applications. R.C. 3714.051(A)(2); former R.C. 3714.06(A), 1990 Am.Sub.H.B. No. 366, 143 Ohio Laws, Part III, 4670. R.C. 3714.053 now requires public hearings. The general statutory scheme provides for hearings to be conducted either before the director or local board or before ERAC on appeal, with regard to decisions granting, denying, or revoking licenses. R.C. 3745.07 (the director of environmental protection may issue a proposed order to grant or deny a license, and if the director denies or issues a license not preceded by a proposed order, a person who is adversely affected may appeal to ERAC); R.C. 3745.05 (if no adjudication hearing was conducted, ERAC shall conduct a hearing de novo on appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">{\u00b6 23} Allowing appeals of nonfinal licensing decisions could undermine the statutory framework. If actions or acts need not be final to be appealed, then successive appeals of interim decisions of the reviewing body would be possible. If ERAC were to be inundated with appeals of nonfinal decisions, the flood could delay the time for decision on appeals and thus slow the license-review process as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">{\u00b6 24} Determining which nonfinal decisions would trigger appeal rights would be less than clear, making it difficult for a would-be appellant even to determine when the 30-day appeal time in R.C. 3745.04(D) begins to run. Additionally, as discussed below, appellate court and ERAC decisions concerning appellate jurisdiction under R.C. 3745.04(B) have required some indicia of finality of a decision to be appealable, even if the decision is not designated as final.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-8\">{\u00b6 25} We agree with the dissenting judge below that the better reading of ERAC\u2019s authority under R.C. 3745.04(B) to \u201corder[ ] the director or the board of health to perform an act\u201d permits ERAC, upon review of a final action, to direct the licensing entity to grant the approval that the licensing entity failed or refused to grant. 2007-Ohio-7144, 2007 WL 4564303, \u00b6 17 (French, J., dissenting). In that instance, ERAC would not be ordering a modification of the action, or merely vacating the decision below, but would be ordering the board of health <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>or director to take the action that it believes should have been taken but was not. The fact that R.C. 3745.04(A) defines \u201cact\u201d and \u201caction\u201d interchangeably supports this view. R.C. 3745.04(A) lists examples of decisions that constitute either \u201cacts\u201d or \u201cactions.\u201d For example, a decision to issue or deny a license may be an \u201caction\u201d or \u201cact\u201d under R.C. 3745.04(A). Under R.C. 3745.04(B), an action such as a denial of a license may be appealed to ERAC, and ERAC has authority under the statute not only to vacate that order but also to order the director or a board of health to perform the act of issuing the license.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">{\u00b6 26} We hold that ERAC\u2019s statutory authority to order the performance of an act is ancillary to ERAC\u2019s appellate jurisdiction to review final actions of a local board of health or the director of environmental protection. ERAC may order the board or director to perform an act in accordance with ERAC\u2019s decision on appeal of an action, rather than simply vacating or modifying the action. This reading of R.C. 3745.04 comports with ERAC\u2019s expertise and authority to review decisions granting or denying licenses consistent with environmental-law requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">{\u00b6 27} Having decided that ERAC\u2019s authority under R.C. 3745.04(B) to \u201corder[ ] the director or board of health to perform an act\u201d does not provide an independent basis for ERAC to entertain appellate jurisdiction over nonfinal decisions of a local board of health, we next consider whether a board\u2019s determination that a C &amp; DD license application is incomplete is an immediately appealable action under R.C. 3745.04(A) and (B).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-8\">{\u00b6 28} R.C. 3745.04(A) defines both \u201caction\u201d and \u201cact\u201d to include \u201cthe issuance, denial, modification, or revocation of a license,\u201d but the question here is whether a license applicant may appeal a determination that the license application is incomplete. The determination that a license application is incomplete is not listed as an \u201caction\u201d or \u201cact\u201d under R.C. 3745.04(A). However, R.C. 3745.04(A)\u2019s definition of \u201caction\u201d or \u201cact,\u201d which may be appealed to ERAC, is not limited to the decisions listed in that statute. The statute says that \u201caction\u201d or \u201cact\u201d <em>includes </em>certain things, thus showing the General Assembly\u2019s intent to illustrate the types of actions that may be appealable, rather than to set out an exhaustive list. <em>Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Co. v. Maynard </em>(1984), 22 Ohio App.3d 3, 6, 22 OBR 37, 488 N.E.2d 220 (holding that the predecessor to ERAC had appellate jurisdiction to consider whether it was reasonable and lawful for the director of environmental protection to adopt standards for the disposal and storage of hazardous waste without adopting a rule allowing interested parties a right to petition the director for changes in the state hazardous-waste program).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-9\">{\u00b6 29} When an action is not listed in R.C. 3745.04(A), ERAC has considered whether the form of the document shows that it is a final action. ERAC has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>determined, for example, that documents that designate the decision as a final action or advise the recipient of the right to appeal or that have been entered on the director\u2019s journal are indicative of final \u201cactions.\u201d See, e.g., <em>Trans Rail Am., Inc. v. Enyeart, </em>2007-Ohio-7144, 2007 WL 4564303, \u00b6 33 (French, J., dissenting); <em>Lake v. Jones </em>(Nov. 20, 2003), ERAC Nos. 255300 and 255601, 2003 WL 23358112. The May 31, 2006 letter from Enyeart to Trans Rail does not contain these indicia of a final action.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">{\u00b6 30} The court of appeals and ERAC also review the substance of the challenged decision to ascertain whether it finally determines some matter that affects the appellant\u2019s substantial rights, privileges, or property. In <em>Dayton Power &amp; Light Co. v. Schregardus </em>(10th Dist.1997), 123 Ohio App.3d 476, 704 N.E.2d <em>589, for </em>example, the court reversed ERAC\u2019s dismissal <em>of </em>an appeal from the director\u2019s decision to place a property on a master site list of contaminated properties. Government officials and other businesses reviewed that list when evaluating property. Because appellant had no opportunity either to contest the inclusion of its property on the list before the list was made public or to have appellant\u2019s property removed from the list, the court remanded the case to ERAC to hear the owner\u2019s claim that inclusion of the property on the master site list \u201caffected a substantial legal right with finality and/or that Ohio EPA exceeded its authority by promulgating\u201d the list. Id. at 481, 704 N.E.2d 589. ERAC\u2019s jurisdiction to hear the appeal was not defeated by the fact that the action complained of was not listed in R.C. 3745.04(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">{\u00b6 31} The key issue in determining whether a particular decision not listed in R.C. 3745.04(A) is an action or act that may be appealed under R.C. 3745.04(B) is whether it is in some sense a final decision that substantially affects the appellant\u2019s property or other legal rights, even if it is not designated as final. <em>Dayton Power &amp; Light. Cain Park Apts. v. Nied </em>(June 25, 1981), 10th Dist. Nos. 80AP-817, 80AP-852, 80AP-867, 80AP-868, and 80AP-869, 1981 WL 3294, relied upon by Trans Rail, confirms this approach. In <em>Cain Park Apts., </em>appellants, owners of apartment buildings, applied to Ohio EPA to register their incinerators to dispose of residential waste. The appellants received letters from EPA advising them that the information they submitted about the nature and quantity of the emissions from their incinerators was deficient and that if appellants failed to provide the requested information within two weeks, their registration applications would be returned. Then-applicable regulations provided that EPA could treat a defective application as if it had not been filed at all. Ohio Adm.Code 3745-35-02(B)(9), 1979-1980 Ohio Monthly Record 4270. Appellants appealed these letters to ERAC\u2019s predecessor, the Environmental Board of Review (\u201cEBR\u201d), which held that it had no jurisdiction over the appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>{\u00b6 32} Upon review, the court of appeals in <em>Cain Park Apts. </em>held that the return of appellants\u2019 registration application as defective was an appealable action because it was tantamount to a denial of the application. The fact that EPA could return an application without further hearing or compliance with the procedures for denial of an application made the challenged decision the legal equivalent of a denial, i.e., a final decision with regard to the application submitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">(\u00b6 33} In this case, the applicable rule states, \u201cAn incomplete application [for a C &amp; DD facility] shall not be considered.\u201d Ohio Adm.Code 3745-37-02(A)(2). The rule further requires that the applicant must be notified of the nature of the deficiency within 60 days of the application. Id. Ohio Adm.Code 3745-37-02(A)(3) also provides that if the licensing authority determines that information in addition to that required by Ohio Adm.Code 3745-37-02 is necessary to determine whether the application satisfies the license requirements, the applicant must supply that information as a precondition to further consideration of the license application. The rules thus contemplate additional proceedings after an initial determination that a C &amp; DD application is incomplete, including notification of the precise nature of the deficiencies and specification of any further information required to consider the application. These rules suggest that in the usual case, a decision that an application is incomplete, accompanied by a specification of the precise nature of the deficiencies and a reasonable request for additional information, will not be a final act or action of the licensing agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">(\u00b6 34} However, as ERAC explained in this case, the requirement of a final decision does not mean that the licensing entity (a board of health or the director of environmental protection) can evade appellate review under R.C. 3745.04(B) simply by deeming a license application incomplete and repeatedly and unreasonably requesting additional information before the licensing entity will consider the application on its merits. Application requirements in statutes and administrative rules, as reasonably amplified by the licensing agency, will be instructive regarding whether an application for a license is complete. See, e.g., <em>CECOS Internatl., Inc., v. Shank </em>(1991), 74 Ohio App.3d 43, 55, 598 N.E.2d 40. Even if a decision is not designated a final action, it may be a reviewable final action if it in effect determines any legal right or privilege of the appellant. <em>Dayton Power &amp; Light; Cain Park Apts.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>\n<em>B</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">{\u00b6 35} In this case, ERAC dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction but stated that Enyeart\u2019s decision to request more information was reasonable. The court of appeals determined that ERAC erred in reaching the merits of the issue of whether Trans Rail\u2019s application was incomplete without holding a hearing. 2007-Ohio-7144, 2007 WL 4564303, \u00b6 14. That ruling is not before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">{\u00b6 36} Because the court of appeals construed R.C. 3745.04(B) as providing ERAC with appellate jurisdiction to order a licensing agency to \u201cperform an act\u201d independently of whether the underlying decision was a final action, the court of appeals did not consider whether the board\u2019s May 31, 2006 letter was a final decision. 2007-Ohio-7144, 2007 WL 4564303, \u00b6 11. We now vacate the court of appeals\u2019 judgment on that basis, and we remand this case to the court of appeals for a determination whether Enyeart\u2019s May 31, 2006 letter determining Trans Rail\u2019s application to be incomplete was a final decision appealable to ERAC under R.C. 3745.04(B) under the criteria outlined above.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">{\u00b6 37} Accordingly, we hold that the court of appeals erred in concluding that Enyeart\u2019s letter that declared Trans Rail\u2019s application to be incomplete and requested further information was appealable to the Environmental Review Appeals Commission without regard to whether it was a final action of the Trumbull County Board of Health.

In an area without a health district on an approved list, the director of environmental protection may issue such licenses. R.C. 3714.051(A)(2); former R.C. 3714.06(A), 1990 Am. Sub.H.B.

I would also hold that the Trumbull County Health Department\u2019s actions in this case, refusing to consider a license application because it was incomplete, did not constitute a final decision, and, therefore, ERAC properly determined that it did not have jurisdiction to hear the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">{\u00b6 39} The proper resolution of this case follows directly from the precise text of the statute at issue, R.C. 3745.04, which provides ERAC\u2019s appellate jurisdiction. When interpreting a statute, we first look to its plain language and apply it as written if the meaning is unambiguous. <em>State v. Lowe, </em>112 Ohio St.3d 507, 2007-Ohio-606, 861 N.E.2d 512, \u00b6 9. R.C. 3745.04(B) provides: \u201cAny person who was a party to a proceeding before the director of environmental protection may participate in an appeal to the environmental review appeals commission for an order vacating or modifying the action of the director or a local board of health, or ordering the director or board of health to perform an act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">{\u00b6 40} The majority determines that this section requires a final determination by the local board of health because \u201cERAC\u2019s statutory authority to order the performance of an act is ancillary to ERAC\u2019s appellate jurisdiction to review final actions of a local board of health or the director of environmental protection.\u201d Majority opinion at \u00b6 26. The majority\u2019s rationale in support, that this ancillary authority allows ERAC to order some act, such as issuing a license, rather than merely vacating an order, ignores the fact that ERAC could order that same act simply by modifying the original order pursuant to its primary grant of authority in R.C. 3745.04 to vacate or modify. More important, the majority\u2019s analysis belies the proper construction of the statutory text as described by the dissent. There is nothing in the statute to suggest that the second grant of authority is somehow ancillary to the first. As noted in the dissent, the conjunction \u201cor\u201d is used to establish two separate grants of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-9\">{\u00b6 41} This latter construction does not, however, mean that ERAC can consider appeals without a final action by the local board of health, as the dissent contends. The first part of the sentence in R.C. 3745.04(B) providing for appeals to ERAC states that \u201c[a]ny person who <em>was </em>a party\u201d may appeal. (Emphasis added.) The past tense used in the statute presumes that the proceeding being appealed to ERAC has concluded, resulting in some final action by the local board of health. If the local board has not yet taken any action on a license application, for example, then the applicant would still be a party to that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>proceeding and he would not meet the plain text of the statutory requirement for ERAC appellate jurisdiction. R.C. 3745.04(B) does therefore require a final action by a local board of health or the director of environmental protection for a party to appeal to ERAC.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-3\">{\u00b6 42} Were this court to read the statute to allow appeals of nonfinal actions, the limited appeal system established by the General Assembly would be meaningless. A party could completely bypass the local board of health in favor of immediately petitioning ERAC to order the local board to perform some act. That arrangement would thwart legislative intent and put a heavy burden on the resources of ERAC.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">{\u00b6 43} A determination by a local board of health or the director of environmental protection that a license application is incomplete, as occurred in this case, cannot constitute a final action under R.C. 3745.04 so that ERAC would have jurisdiction to hear an appeal. As noted by the majority, once an application is deemed to be incomplete, the regulations require that the applicant be notified of the deficiency to allow the applicant to supplement the application. Ohio Adm.Code 3745-37-02(A)(2). The license-approval proceeding is still ongoing at this stage. The regulations specifically contemplate further consideration of an application once the deficiencies have been rectified. See id.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">{\u00b6 44} The majority concludes that a decision of a local board of health that an application is incomplete may still be a final action \u201cif it in effect determines any legal right or privilege of the appellant.\u201d Majority opinion at \u00b6 34. But such a decision will never completely determine the applicant\u2019s legal rights because the local board will have reached no decision regarding the applicant\u2019s right to a license, and once an application\u2019s deficiencies are remedied, the application will then be considered and ruled upon.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">{\u00b6 45} The majority further contends that a contrary holding could allow a local board or the director of environmental protection to evade review if it seeks to deny an applicant from obtaining a license by perpetually deeming the application incomplete. An aggrieved applicant could, however, file an action in mandamus to compel the local board or director to consider the application, if it is in fact complete, and either issue or deny a license. For an action to lie in mandamus a relator must demonstrate (1) a clear legal right to the relief sought, (2) a clear legal duty of the respondent to perform the requested action, and (3) the lack of an adequate remedy at law. <em>State ex rel. Ohio Assn. of Pub. School Emps. v. Batavia Local School Dist. Bd. of Edn. </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 191, 198, 729 N.E.2d 743.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>{\u00b6 46} R.C. 3714.051 satisfies the first two parts of the test by requiring a board of health or the director of environmental protection to issue a license for a facility for the disposal of construction and demolition debris if the proposal complies with the appropriate rules and standards. An applicant would further have no adequate remedy at law, because R.C. 3745.04 permits appeals to ERAC only of final decisions by the local board or director, as discussed above. We have held that \u201cwhen a state agency\u2019s decision is discretionary and by statute not subject to appeal, an action in mandamus is the sole avenue of relief available to a party challenging the agency\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Ohio Academy of Nursing Homes v. Ohio Dept. of Job &amp; Family Servs., </em>114 Ohio St.3d 14, 2007-Ohio-2620, 867 N.E.2d 400, \u00b6 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">{\u00b6 47} I concur in the majority\u2019s holding that R.C. 3745.04(B) requires a final action by the local board of health or director to permit an appeal to ERAC. I dissent, however, from the conclusion that a letter from a local board deeming a license application incomplete can constitute a final action and be subject to appeal. I would therefore reverse the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b126-7\">Lanzinger, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Axg\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">(\u00b6 48} Does the Environmental Review Appeals Commission (\u201cERAC\u201d) have jurisdiction over Trans Rail\u2019s appeal? I would hold that it does.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-9\">{\u00b6 49} Appellee Trans Rail attempted to submit an application for a license for a facility for the disposal of construction and demolition debris in Trumbull County. The company argues that timing for a completed application was important because more stringent siting criteria were to take effect on July 1, 2005. It made a first submission to the health department in May 2004 but was told that the application was incomplete. Even though it submitted additional information in December 2005 and on March 30, 2006, its application was still deemed incomplete, meaning that by regulation, its application would not even be considered. Ohio Adm.Code 3745-37-02(A)(2). In other words, Trans Rail\u2019s license would not be issued or denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-10\">{\u00b6 50} The majority accepts appellant\u2019s argument that R.C. 3745.04 requires a final action of the director of environmental protection or a local board of health in order for ERAC to have jurisdiction over an appeal. Nevertheless, R.C. 3745.04(B) provides that a party may appeal to ERAC for <em>\u201can order </em>vacating or modifying the action of the director or a local board of health, or <em>ordering the director or board of health to perform an act.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>{\u00b6 51} \u201cAct\u201d or \u201caction\u201d is defined in R.C. 3745.04(A):</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">{\u00b6 52} \u201cAs used in this section, <em>\u2018action\u2019 or \u2018act\u2019 includes </em>the adoption, modification, or repeal of a rule or standard, <em>the issuance, </em>modification, or revocation of any lawful order other than an emergency order, and <em>the issuance, denial, </em>modification, or revocation <em>of a license, </em>permit, lease, variance, or certificate, or the approval or disapproval of plans and specifications pursuant to law or rules adopted thereunder.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">{\u00b6 53} R.C. 3745.04 contains no provision that ERAC has jurisdiction over final actions only, but other provisions in R.C. Title 37 suggest that when a party is appealing an action of the director or local board to ERAC, that action must be a final one. See R.C. 3704.036(B)(3)(c) (when the director approves or disapproves an administrative Title V permit amendment, the director\u2019s determination \u201cis a final action appealable to the environmental review appeals commission under section 3745.04 of the Revised Code\u201d) and 3734.05(I)(6) (the director\u2019s approval or disapproval of a Class 1 modification application \u201cis not a final action that is appealable under Chapter 3745. of the Revised Code,\u201d but the director\u2019s approval or disapproval of a Class 2 or Class 3 modification application \u201cis a final action that is appealable under that chapter\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">{\u00b6 54} Even if actions of the director or local board must be final to be appealable, R.C. 3745.04 still allows a party to file an appeal requesting ERAC to order the director or board to perform an act. The plain language of the statute establishes two distinct ways in which a party may appeal to ERAC: a party may appeal for an order \u201cvacating or modifying the action of the director or a local board of health, <em>or </em>ordering the director or board of health to perform an act.\u201d (Emphasis added.) R.C. 3745.04(B). As the court of appeals explained, \u201cthe statute invests the ERAC with jurisdiction over two types of appeals: (1) an appeal from an \u2018action\u2019 that the ERAC may vacate or modify, and (2) an appeal requesting that the ERAC order the performance of an \u2018act.\u2019 \u201d 2007-Ohio-7144, 2007 WL 4564303, \u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">{\u00b6 55} The majority, however, holds that ERAC\u2019s ability to order the performance of an act is ancillary to its jurisdiction to review actions of the director or local board. In doing so, it adds words to the statute by requiring that before a party may seek an order that the department \u201cperform an act,\u201d there must first be \u201ca final decision that substantially affects the applicant\u2019s property or other legal rights.\u201d Majority opinion at \u00b6 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-9\">{\u00b6 56} To accomplish this result, the majority phrases the issue before us as \u201cwhether a license applicant may appeal a determination that the license application is incomplete.\u201d Nevertheless, as the court of appeals noted, \u201cTrans Rail\u2019s appeal requests that the ERAC order the Health Department to either issue or deny it a license to establish a construction and demolition debris facility.\u201d 2007-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>Ohio-7144, 2007 WL 4564303, \u00b6 10. Trans Rail, in effect, is asking ERAC for an order compelling the health board to act by either issuing or denying the license. Each of these two actions is listed in the statutory definition of \u201cact,\u201d which includes \u201cissuance, denial, modification, or revocation of a license.\u201d R.C. 3745.04(A). Trans Rail is not asking ERAC to review a final order. This is not a premature appeal- \u2014 it is an action seeking the second type of relief that ERAC is authorized to give: an order requiring Enyeart to grant or deny a license. The order itself, of course, is appealable according to the first type of jurisdiction provided for in R.C. 3745.04.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">{\u00b6 57} In concluding that the second type of jurisdiction is ancillary to the first, the majority also fails to recognize the significance of the General Assembly\u2019s use of the word \u201cor\u201d in establishing the two types of jurisdiction given to ERAC. By allowing for an appeal for an order \u201cvacating or modifying the action of the director or a local board of health, <em>or </em>ordering the director or board of health to perform an act,\u201d the statute is phrased in a way that clearly states that parties may base their appeals on either the first or second type of jurisdiction provided for in R.C. 3745.04. (Emphasis added.) This language indicates the General Assembly\u2019s intention to give ERAC two coequal appellate powers. Therefore, the majority is mistaken in concluding that the second type of jurisdiction is ancillary to the first.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">{\u00b6 58} In addition, by first requiring a final decision before a party may seek an order requiring the director or board to perform an act, the majority allows undue extension of the licensing process. A board of health or the director of environmental protection may continue to deem a license application incomplete and request additional information indefinitely. Indeed, in this case, Trans Rail alleges that it has repeatedly complied with the requirements for its license application, yet the director persists in stating that the application is incomplete and that no ruling may be made upon it. Unless \u201cit is in some sense a final decision that substantially affects the appellant\u2019s property or other legal rights,\u201d majority opinion at \u00b6 31, the licensing entity\u2019s lack of decision will continue to evade appellate review under the majority\u2019s reading of R.C. 3745.04(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">{\u00b6 59} Because the requirement of final action is not set forth within R.C. 3745.04 as a prerequisite for ERAC\u2019s jurisdiction in appeals requesting ERAC to order the director or board to act, I would not write it in. If the General Assembly wishes to limit the jurisdiction of ERAC in this second type of appeal, it may do so by amending the statute. I respectfully dissent and would affirm the judgment of the Tenth District Court of Appeals.</p>\n<judges id=\"b128-7\">Pfeifer, J., concurs in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n<attorneys id=\"b129-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>Morganstern, MacAdams &amp; DeVito Co. and Michael A.
