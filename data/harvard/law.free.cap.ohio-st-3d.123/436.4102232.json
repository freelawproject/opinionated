The Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline has recommended that we suspend respondent from the practice of law in Ohio for one year, with six months of that suspension stayed on the condition that respondent commit no further misconduct. The board\u2019s recommendation is based on findings that respondent notarized nine documents without personally witnessing the signatures. We accept the board\u2019s findings that respondent committed this professional misconduct as well as the recommendation for a one-year suspension, with six months stayed on the condition that no further incidents of misconduct occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-12\">{\u00b6 2} Relator, Ohio State Bar Association, filed a single-count complaint that alleged violations of three Disciplinary Rules of the former Code of Professional Responsibility. A panel of the board found that relator failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that respondent violated DR 1-102(A)(5) (conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice) and recommended that the charge be dismissed. The panel did find violations of DR 1-102(A)(4) (conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation) and 1-102(A)(6) (conduct that adversely reflects on a lawyer\u2019s fitness to practice law). The panel recommended a one-year suspension from the practice of law, stayed on the condition that respondent commit no further violations. The board adopted the panel\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law. It did not, however, adopt the proposed sanction, recommending instead that respondent be suspended for one year, with only six months stayed.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>{\u00b6 3} Respondent was contacted by a former employee, Ivory E. Welch Jr., who indicated that an acquaintance, Tracie Lee Harper, wanted deeds prepared that would transfer ownership of several properties to Welch. On January 26, 2007, respondent met with both Harper and Welch in respondent\u2019s office and was given seven quitclaim deeds that were partially completed. Harper signed the deeds in respondent\u2019s presence and gave them to respondent for completion. Respondent gave the deeds to his secretary and then left the room to attend to other matters. When he returned a short time later, the deeds were completed. Respondent assumed that the deeds were the same deeds that he had watched Harper sign shortly before, and he notarized them.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">{\u00b6 4} That assumption proved incorrect. Apparently, respondent\u2019s secretary, rather than simply typing in the missing information, prepared seven new deeds, but Harper left without signing them. As a result, Welch, believing that time was of the essence and that he had Harper\u2019s authorization to do so, signed Harper\u2019s name to the deeds. These deeds were then presented to respondent, who notarized them.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">{\u00b6 5} Respondent was not present when Welch signed Harper\u2019s name, and Welch did not tell respondent that he had done so. Welch then took the deeds to be filed. Hoping to exempt the transfers from conveyance fees, Welch had also prepared two affidavits and signed Harper\u2019s name to them. The affidavits, which were allegedly also notarized by the respondent, claimed that the properties were being conveyed to Welch for the purpose of quick resale. Respondent denied signing either document. Welch testified that he was certain that respondent had notarized one of the documents, and a handwriting expert testified that the signatures on both affidavits were respondent\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">{\u00b6 6} On February 6, 2007, respondent was confronted by two men who were involved in a property dispute with Harper. The men claimed that the deeds were forged and informed respondent that they had initiated a lawsuit against him. Respondent immediately contacted Harper, and he, Welch, and another individual, Ben Lanier, went to Harper\u2019s suburban home. According to both respondent and Welch, Harper took control of that meeting and prepared a power of attorney that, among other things, gave Welch the authority to sign Harper\u2019s name to any documents necessary to effectuate the real estate transfer. That document was backdated to January 26 and was notarized by Lanier. Respondent was \u201cnot certain that [he] paid the date [on the power of attorney] any attention\u201d when he saw the document.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">{\u00b6 7} The panel heard this matter on March 6, 2009. After the submission of posthearing briefs, it issued its report. It found that respondent\u2019s notarization of the deeds and affidavits without personally witnessing Harper\u2019s signature violat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>ed DR 1-102(A)(4) and (6). It did not find sufficient evidence of a violation of DR 1-102(A)(5) and recommended that the charge be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">{\u00b6 8} The panel then considered the aggravating and mitigating factors contained in BCGD Proc.Reg. (10)(B)(1) and (2). It found three aggravating factors (1) multiple violations, (2) respondent\u2019s participation in a meeting where a power of attorney was backdated in order to cover up earlier misconduct, and (3) respondent\u2019s failure to acknowledge the wrongfulness of his conduct. In mitigation, the panel found (1) no prior disciplinary record, (2) respondent\u2019s cooperation at hearing, and (3) respondent\u2019s history of community service. The panel ultimately recommended a one-year suspension, fully stayed, on the condition that respondent commit no further violations. The board adopted the panel\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law, but not its recommended sanction. Citing respondent\u2019s \u201crepeated acts of fraud and failure to acknowledge his wrongdoing,\u201d the board recommended a suspension from the practice of law for one year, with six months stayed on the condition that no further misconduct occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">{\u00b6 9} We agree with the board, and upon our review of the evidence, we adopt the board\u2019s findings of fact, conclusions of law, and recommended sanction. Respondent abused his notary power on nine documents and was present when yet another fraudulent document was created to cover up the earlier misconduct. This conduct constitutes multiple acts of fraud that distinguish this case from those in which a public reprimand or fully stayed suspension was imposed for an isolated instance of notary abuse. See, e.g., <em>Cincinnati Bar Assn. v. Thomas </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 402, 754 N.E.2d 1263; <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Heffter, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 320, 2003-Ohio-775, 784 N.E.2d 693;, <em>Columbus Bar Assn. v. Dougherty, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 307, 2005-Ohio-1825, 825 N.E.2d 1094; <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Freedman, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 284, 2006-Ohio-4480, 853 N.E.2d 291.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">{\u00b6 10} Accordingly, respondent is suspended from the practice of law in Ohio for one year, with six months stayed on the condition that respondent commit no further misconduct. Costs taxed to respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b552-8\">Moyer, C.J., and Pfeifer, O\u2019Connor, Lanzinger, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b552-9\">Lundberg Stratton and O\u2019Donnell, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b552-10\">O\u2019Donnell, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AC6R\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-11\">{\u00b6 11} I respectfully dissent. After practicing law for 49 years without a blemish, respondent, believing he was helping, made mistakes by notarizing documents that he had not seen the affiant sign.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Acm\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>Taft, Stettinius <em>&amp; </em>Hollister, L.L.P., and Hugh E.

I would suspend respondent for a period of six months but stay that term on the condition of no further violations.</p>\n<judges id=\"b553-5\">Lundberg Stratton, J., concurs in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
