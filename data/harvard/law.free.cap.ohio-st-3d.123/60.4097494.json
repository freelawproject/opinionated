On December 4, 2007, we imposed an attorney-registration suspension on respondent\u2019s license to practice law. <em>In re Attorney Registration Suspension, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 1420, 2007-Ohio-6463, 877 N.E.2d 305. Respondent\u2019s whereabouts are unknown. The Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline recommends that we permanently disbar respondent, based on findings that she has been indicted on several felony charges and that she accepted payment from clients and failed to take action on their behalf, failed to advise a client that she did not maintain malpractice insurance, converted funds of a minor that she held in her capacity as guardian ad litem, and failed to respond during the investigation of this misconduct. We accept the board\u2019s findings of professional misconduct and recommendation for permanent disbarment.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-13\">{\u00b6 2} Relator, Disciplinary Counsel, charged respondent in an eight-count complaint with multiple violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct, the Code of Professional Responsibility (in effect until February 1, 2007), and Gov.Bar R. V(4)(G) (requiring an attorney\u2019s cooperation in a disciplinary investigation). A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>complaint was sent to the respondent\u2019s last known place of employment and last known residence, but according to the Butler County Sheriffs Office, respondent has left the country, has given no forwarding address, and has not returned. On September 22, 2008, service was made upon the clerk of the Supreme Court pursuant to Gov.Bar R. V(11)(B) (designating the clerk of the Supreme Court as agent for service when an attorney conceals his or her whereabouts). Relator subsequently filed a motion for default pursuant to Gov.Bar R. V(6)(F). A master commissioner appointed by the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline granted the motion and recommended that respondent be permanently disbarred. The board concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\">Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">\n<em>Count I</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">{\u00b6 3} On November 21, 2007, respondent was indicted by a Butler County grand jury on 28 counts of tampering with records, one count of forgery, and one count of grand theft, all stemming from the following conduct. In response to an inquiry from another attorney, the Butler County Court of Common Pleas contacted the Butler County Sheriffs Office, which discovered that respondent had altered many fee applications to cover court-appointed work (worth several thousand dollars) by replacing other attorneys\u2019 names and addresses with the name \u201cJeff Stone,\u201d an attorney who once practiced law in Ohio, and including her home address. It was also discovered that respondent had altered fee applications for services she performed on behalf of indigent defendants. The original amounts that respondent had requested for her services had been reduced by the court because her applications had been filed late; however, respondent whited out the reduced compensation granted by the court and replaced these lower figures with the original amounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">{\u00b6 4} The board found that by committing these acts, respondent violated Prof.Cond.R. 8.4(b) (prohibiting attorneys from committing illegal acts that reflect adversely on their honesty or trustworthiness), 8.4(c) (prohibiting attorneys from engaging in conduct that involves dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation), and 8.4(h) (prohibiting attorneys from engaging in conduct that adversely reflects on their fitness to practice law).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">\n<em>Count II</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b175-9\">{\u00b6 5} On March 14, 2007, respondent was hired by Judith Crocker to represent her in a divorce action. Respondent received $1,125 from her client and filed an initial complaint. But respondent did not appear at a scheduling conference on November 29, 2007, and the client has since been unable to contact respondent or obtain any refund. And rather than depositing the unearned funds into a lawyer\u2019s trust account, respondent signed the client\u2019s check over to a relative. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>{\u00b6 6} The board found that respondent\u2019s failure to take action on her client\u2019s behalf, keep her reasonably informed, and respond to reasonable requests about her case were violations of Prof.Cond.R. 1.3 (requiring an attorney to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client), 1.4(a)(3) (requiring an attorney to keep clients reasonably informed about the status of their cases), and 1.4(a)(4) (requiring attorneys to comply as soon as practicable with reasonable requests for information from a client). The board also found that by failing to hold her client\u2019s money in a separate trust account, respondent violated Prof.Cond.R. 1.15(a) (requiring attorneys to maintain clients\u2019 funds in a client trust account). Additionally, the board found that respondent\u2019s conduct reflected negatively on her fitness to practice law, in violation of Prof.Cond.R. 8.4(h), and that her failure to respond to multiple inquiries from the board was equivalent to a failure to cooperate in the investigation, which constitutes a violation of Gov.Bar R. V(4)(G).</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">\n<em>Count III</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">{\u00b6 7} On August 23, 2007, respondent was hired to represent Steven Swem in a felony criminal matter. Swem\u2019s mother, Mary Sheets, and her husband paid respondent a $10,000 retainer by cashier\u2019s check, which respondent signed over to a relative. Respondent failed to appear for a preliminary hearing, although another attorney appeared on her behalf. Swem\u2019s mother hired a new attorney to represent him and has not heard from respondent since before the first hearing. Nor has she received any refund of the fees paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">{\u00b6 8} The board found respondent\u2019s conduct to be in violation of Prof.Cond.R. 1.3, 1.4(a)(3), 1.4(a)(4), 1.15(a), 8.4(c), and 8.4(h), and Gov.Bar R. V(4)(G).</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">\n<em>Count IV</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">{\u00b6 9} In August 2006, Kenneth Hollon, who had recently experienced a reduction in income, paid respondent $1,000 to assist him in reducing his child-support obligation. According to the client, respondent informed him that \u201cshe could not file the case immediately because the court was too busy to accept it\u201d and that he \u201cwould have to wait.\u201d Respondent took no further action, ignored the client\u2019s repeated attempts to contact her, and did not refund any of the $1,000. Respondent never filed any motion to reduce her client\u2019s child-support obligation, and the Butler County Child Support Enforcement Agency later found him to be in default of the unreduced child-support order. The agency suspended his driver\u2019s license, and he accrued a child-support arrearage of approximately $4,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-9\">{\u00b6 10} The board found that respondent\u2019s conduct and failure to respond to inquiries violated Prof.Cond.R. 1.3, 1.4(a)(3), 1.4(a)(4), 8.4(c), and 8.4(h), and Gov.Bar R. V(4)(G).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>\n<em>Count V</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">{\u00b6 11} In 2003, respondent was hired to represent Lynn Collins and her husband as plaintiffs in a defamation case. The couple paid respondent a total of $5,280. Respondent initially defended a civil protection order and wrote the opposing party a letter requesting that he refrain from making slanderous comments. Respondent then told her client that a lawsuit had been filed in the Preble County Court of Common Pleas but that the court was too busy to hear the case and suggested that it be transferred to Butler County. Respondent requested and received additional fees to transfer the case, yet took no action. Later it was discovered that no lawsuit had been filed in either Preble County or Butler County.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">{\u00b6 12} The board found that respondent had violated Prof.Cond.R. 1.3, 1.4(a)(3), 1.4(a)(4), 8.4(c), and 8.4(h), and Gov.Bar R. V(4)(G).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">\n<em>Count VI</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b177-8\">{\u00b6 13} On June 27, 2007, Christina Kennedy hired respondent to represent her in a custody matter. She paid respondent $3,000; however, respondent failed to appear at the custody hearing. The client attempted to contact respondent after the hearing, but learned that respondent had left the country. In addition, respondent failed to attend a hearing regarding a traffic matter for which the client had retained her.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-9\">{\u00b6 14} The board found that respondent had violated Prof.Cond.R. 1.3, 1.4(a)(3), 1.4(a)(4), 8.4(c), and 8.4(h), and Gov.Bar R. V(4)(G).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-10\">\n<em>Count VII</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b177-11\">{\u00b6 15} In 2003, Mona Hamilton sued respondent for legal malpractice stemming from a divorce proceeding she failed to handle properly. In 2006, a settlement of $500,000 was agreed to and reduced to judgment, but the sum remains uncollected, in part because respondent did not carry malpractice insurance. During the original divorce proceedings, respondent neglected to inform her client that she did not carry malpractice insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-12\">{\u00b6 16} The board found this omission to be a violation of DR 1-104(A) (requiring an attorney to inform a client if the attorney does not maintain professional-liability insurance of at least $100,000 per occurrence and $300,000 in the aggregate).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Also, the board found a violation of Gov.Bar R. V(4)(G) based on respondent\u2019s failure to reply to relator\u2019s inquiries.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>\n<em>Count VIII</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">{\u00b6 17} In 1995, respondent was named guardian ad litem in charge of a minor beneficiary\u2019s trust account by the Butler County Court of Common Pleas. The funds were to be paid to the beneficiary on his 18th birthday. Since turning 18, the beneficiary has unsuccessfully attempted to contact respondent regarding his trust and has been unable to locate the money.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">{\u00b6 18} The board found that respondent\u2019s actions constituted violations of DR 9 \u2014 102(B)(3) (requiring the maintenance of complete records of all funds, securities, and other properties of a client in an attorney\u2019s possession) and 9-102(B)(4) (requiring prompt payment or delivery of a client\u2019s the funds, securities, or other properties in the possession of the lawyer), in addition to Gov.Bar R. V(4)(G).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">Sanction</p>\n<p id=\"b178-8\">{\u00b6 19} Relator requests that respondent be permanently disbarred, and the master commissioner concurs. The board adopted the master commissioner\u2019s finding, and it recommends that we permanently disbar respondent from practicing law in Ohio. In determining the appropriate sanction, the board considers the aggravating and mitigating factors enumerated in Section 10 of the Rules and Regulations Governing Procedure on Complaints and Hearings Before the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline Regulations (\u201cBCGD Proc.Reg.\u201d). See <em>Columbus Bar Assn. v. Moushey, </em>104 Ohio St.3d 427, 2004-Ohio-6897, 819 N.E.2d 1112, \u00b6 12. The board takes into account many factors, including selfish motive, pattern of misconduct, number of offenses, lack of cooperation in the disciplinary process, failure to acknowledge wrongful conduct, the victims\u2019 vulnerability, the harm these victims suffered, and failure to make restitution. BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(1)(b), (c), (d), (e), (g), (h), and (i).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-9\">{\u00b6 20} Respondent took advantage of vulnerable clients, including a teenage beneficiary, for her own monetary gain. BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(1)(h). Her actions represented a pattern of behavior. BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(1)(c). Respondent\u2019s misconduct resulted in financial hardship for her clients, some of whom had to retain new counsel for services they had already paid respondent to perform. BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(1)(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-10\">{\u00b6 21} Respondent also took advantage of Ohio\u2019s system of indigent representation, a system with limited resources, by falsifying documents in order to collect fees she did not earn. BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(1)(b). She converted the funds of a minor for whom she served as guardian ad litem and thus abused her fiduciary position. Id. She has made no attempt to refund any of the fees she collected and has expressed no remorse for her behavior. BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(1)(g) and (i). Furthermore, respondent has ignored all the board\u2019s attempts to contact her and has evidently fled the country to avoid criminal charges. BCGD Proc.Reg. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>10(B)(1)(e). The board is not aware of mental illness, substance abuse, or any other mitigating factors. See BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(2).</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AeA\">Jonathan E. Coughlan, Disciplinary Counsel, and Heather L. Hissom, Assistant Disciplinary Counsel, for relator.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">{\u00b6 22} \u201cTaking retainers and failing to carry out contracts of employment is tantamount to theft of the fee from the client.\u201d <em>Cincinnati Bar Assn. v. Weaver, </em>102 Ohio St.3d 264, 2004-Ohio-2683, 809 N.E.2d 1113, \u00b6 16. Permanent disbarment is the \u201cpresumptive disciplinary measure\u201d for such misconduct. Id. Respondent repeatedly collected fees from clients without performing any of the services she agreed to perform. Moreover, she regularly misrepresented the status of her clients\u2019 cases and made no effort to refund any of the fees paid. Respondent also deceived and exploited Butler County by falsifying documents to receive compensation she did not earn.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">{\u00b623} The board recommends that respondent be permanently disbarred. \u201cDisbarment is the only appropriate sanction\u201d when an attorney commits \u201cmultiple acts of dishonesty\u201d and \u201ccallous[ly] disregard[s]\u201d his or her responsibility to \u201cclients, the judicial system, and the legal profession.\u201d <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Lentes, </em>120 Ohio St.3d 431, 2008-Ohio-6355, 900 N.E.2d 167, \u00b6 33. Therefore, we accept the board\u2019s recommendation. Accordingly, respondent is hereby permanently disbarred from the practice of law in Ohio. Costs are taxed to respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b179-8\">Moyer, C.J., and Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b177-13\">.
