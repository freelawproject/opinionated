Schmidt v. School Emps. Retirement Sys., </em>100 Ohio St.3d 317, 2003-Ohio-6086, 798 N.E.2d 1088, \u00b6 5; <em>Stewart v. Corrigan, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 80, 2002-Ohio-5316, 776 N.E.2d 103, \u00b6 4. That is, Rose does not contest the propriety of the court of appeals\u2019 denial of the writs based on his failure to comply with Loc.App.R. 45(B)(1) of the Eighth District Court of Appeals. Moreover, Judge McGinty has now ruled on Rose\u2019s August 8, 2008 motion in Cuyahoga C.P. case No. CR-07-492008-B. \u201cNeither procedendo nor mandamus will compel the performance of a duty that has already been performed.\u201d <em>State ex rel.
