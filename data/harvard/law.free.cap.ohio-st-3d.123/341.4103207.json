Wilson, for a writ of mandamus to correct his sentence. The common pleas court was authorized under Crim.R. 36 to correct its clerical error in mistakenly characterizing the degree of the offense of which Wilson was convicted. See <em>State ex rel. Cruzado v. Zaleski, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 353, 2006-Ohio-5795, 856 N.E.2d 263, \u00b6 19. Moreover, Wilson had an adequate remedy by appeal to raise his claim of noncompliance with Crim.R. 32. Id. at \u00b6 32. Finally, Wilson waived this claim on appeal by failing to raise it in his petition in the court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>appeals and by not seeking to amend his petition. See <em>State ex rel. R.W. Sidley, Inc. v. Crawford, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 113, 2003-Ohio-5101, 796 N.E.2d 929, \u00b6 32.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AJl\">Lawrence E.
