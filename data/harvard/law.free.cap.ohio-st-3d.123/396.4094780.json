We conclude that R.C. 2911.01(A)(1) imposes strict liability for that element. Consequently, we reverse the court of appeals\u2019 judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">\n<em>A</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">{\u00b6 2} James Lester and an unnamed accomplice stole money from three men by drawing the victims into playing three-card monte. One of the victims (\u201cvictim two\u201d) became suspicious and asked to see the bag that supposedly contained the players\u2019 money. (At the start of the game, the players, including the victim, put their money in a paper bag ostensibly held for the winner of the game.) The bag that victim two saw turned out to be empty. Lester fled. Victim two then realized that a bank envelope containing $1,800, which had been in a briefcase near where Lester was sitting, was gone.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-9\">{\u00b6 3} Victim two chased Lester. Lester then pulled out a knife, showed it to victim two, and said to him: \u201cI know how to use this knife and I will cut you.\u201d Victim two tried to dial 9-1-1 on his cell phone to get help, but Lester grabbed the phone from his hand. Victim two gave chase, and some young boys helped him get the cell phone back. Lester escaped in a car with Tennessee license plates. Victim two identified the car, and the police apprehended Lester.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-10\">{\u00b6 4} Lester was charged with aggravated robbery, in violation of R.C. 2911.01(A)(1), and robbery, based on the theft of money from victim two, and two counts of theft from the elderly based on two other incidents.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-11\">{\u00b6 5} The jury convicted Lester of aggravated robbery, robbery, and the two counts of theft from the elderly. The trial court merged the count for robbery into the count for aggravated robbery before sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-12\">\n<em>B</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b511-13\">{\u00b6 6} On appeal, the First District Court of Appeals reversed Lester\u2019s aggravated-robbery conviction based on its conclusion that Lester\u2019s indictment was defective for failing to allege a mens rea element for the aggravated-robbery charge. <em>State v. Lester, </em>1st Dist. No. C070383, 2008-Ohio-3570, 2008 WL 2781033, \u00b6 21, 23. The issue whether Lester\u2019s indictment for aggravated robbery was defective because it omitted a mens rea element was raised for the first time on appeal. Under the usual rule, errors not timely raised in the trial court are subject to review only for plain error. Crim.R. 52(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-14\">{\u00b6 7} Pursuant to this court\u2019s decision in <em>State v. Colon, </em>118 Ohio St.3d 26, 2008-Ohio-1624, 885 N.E.2d 917 <em>(\u201cColon </em>I\u201d), however, the First District held that Lester\u2019s conviction was subject to automatic reversal because the indictment\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>failure to specify a mens rea element for aggravated robbery was structural error.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Lester, </em>2008-Ohio-3570, 2008 WL 2781033, \u00b6 20-24. The First District noted: \u201cIn this case, the trial court correctly instructed the jury on what would have been the proper mens rea element, i.e., knowingly, had that element not been omitted in the indictment. But under <em>Colon [I] </em>this was without consequence because at inception the defective indictment tainted the entire process.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 21. The First District\u2019s reference to \u201cknowingly\u201d was to the mens rea element for the theft, which was an element of the aggravated-robbery offense. The appellate court did not identify recklessness as the mens rea required in displaying or brandishing the deadly weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">{\u00b6 8} The First District\u2019s decision preceded by two weeks this court\u2019s decision on reconsideration in <em>State v. Colon, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 204, 2008-Ohio-3749, 893 N.E.2d 169 <em>(\u201cColon II\u201d), </em>which clarified <em>Colon I: </em>\u201cIn a defective-indictment case that does not result in multiple errors that are inextricably linked to the flawed indictment such as those that occurred in <em>Colon I, </em>structural-error analysis would not be appropriate.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 7. This court in <em>Colon II </em>noted that not only was the indictment in that case defective for failure to state the mens rea element of \u201crecklessness,\u201d the trial court had not instructed the jury on recklessness as the applicable mens rea. Id. at \u00b6 6. When the only error was the omission of the applicable mens rea from the indictment, traditional concepts of plain error would apply. Id. at \u00b6 6-7.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">{\u00b6 9} The state appealed the First District\u2019s decision, and we accepted review of its sole proposition of law. <em>State v. Lester, </em>120 Ohio St.3d 1416, 2008-Ohio-6166, 897 N.E.2d 652. The state\u2019s proposition of law asserts: \u201cThere is no distinction, for the purpose of assigning a mens rea element, between the acts of possessing or controlling a deadly weapon during a theft and brandishing, displaying, using or indicating possession of a deadly weapon during a theft.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">{\u00b6 10} The parties disagree whether the state is required to charge any mens rea for the element of displaying, brandishing, indicating possession of, or using a deadly weapon in the aggravated-robbery statute. The state argues that the statute imposes strict liability for that element, and thus no mens rea must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>charged, while Lester argues that the state must charge that a defendant acted recklessly. R.C. 2911.01 provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">{\u00b6 11} \u201c(A) No person, in attempting or committing a theft offense, as defined in section 2913.01 of the Revised Code, or in fleeing immediately after the attempt or offense, shall do any of the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">{\u00b6 12} \u201c(1) <em>Have a deadly weapon on or about the offender\u2019s person or under the offender\u2019s control and either display the weapon, brandish it, indicate that the offender possesses it, or use it.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">{\u00b6 13} Ohio law requires that for one to be found guilty of an offense, \u201c[t]he person [must have] the requisite degree of culpability for each element as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the section defining the offense.\u201d R.C. 2901.21(A)(2). R.C. 2901.21(B) then provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cWhen the section defining an offense does not specify any degree of culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not required for a person to be guilty of the offense. When the section neither specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability, recklessness is sufficient culpability to commit the offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b513-8\">{\u00b6 15} R.C. 2911.01(A)(1) does not specify a degree of culpability, or a mens rea. The question here, then, is whether the General Assembly plainly indicated a purpose to impose strict liability for the conduct of displaying or using a deadly weapon, or whether recklessness is sufficient culpability for that element of the offense of aggravated robbery under R.C. 2911.01(A)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-9\">\n<em>A</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b513-10\">{\u00b6 16} The indictment against Lester did not specify a mens rea for the element of brandishing, displaying, using, or indicating possession of a deadly weapon during the theft offense. As noted above, <em>Colon II </em>clarified that the omission of the mens rea element from an indictment does not require automatic reversal if the trial court properly instructs the jury. The trial court in this case did not instruct the jury that the element of brandishing, displaying, or using a deadly weapon during a theft offense requires a specific level of culpability, although the trial court did instruct the jury that it must find that Lester knowingly committed theft.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-11\">{\u00b6 17} The state\u2019s failure to specify the mens rea in the indictment and the failure to instruct the jury on the mens rea for the element of brandishing, displaying, using, or indicating possession of a deadly weapon constitute error only if a specific level of culpability is required for the element. By contrast, if R.C. 2911.01(A)(1) imposes strict liability for the element, then the court of appeals erred in reversing Lester\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>\n<em>B</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">{\u00b6 18} In answering the question whether the aggravated-robbery statute, R.C. 2911.01(A)(1), \u201cplainly impose[s] strict liability\u201d with regard to the element of brandishing, displaying, using, or indicating possession of a deadly weapon, we must consider what we have previously said about the mens rea applicable to similar statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">{\u00b6 19} In <em>State v. Wharf </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 375, 715 N.E.2d 172, paragraph one of the syllabus, this court held that \u201c[t]he deadly weapon element of R.C. 2911.02(A)(1) * * * does not require the <em>mens rea </em>of recklessness.\u201d In <em>Wharf, </em>the defendant was charged with robbery in violation of R.C. 2911.02(A)(1), which provides that \u201c[n]o person, in attempting or committing a theft offense or in fleeing immediately after the attempt or offense, shall * * * [h]ave a deadly weapon on or about the offender\u2019s person or under the offender\u2019s control.\u201d <em>Wharf, </em>86 Ohio St.3d at 376, 715 N.E.2d 172. Wharf had requested an instruction that would have required the jury to find that he acted recklessly in possessing a deadly weapon during the offense, but the trial court declined to give the instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-8\">{\u00b6 20} This court concluded that \u201cby employing language making mere possession or control of a deadly weapon, as opposed to actual use or intent to use, a violation, it is clear to us that the General Assembly intended that R.C. 2911.02(A)(1) be a strict liability offense.\u201d Id. at 378, 715 N.E.2d 172. The element of having a deadly weapon in one\u2019s possession or under one\u2019s control under R.C. 2911.02(A)(1) \u2014 an element identical to the first part of R.C. 2911.01(A)(1) \u2014 does not, therefore, require that a defendant act with a specific intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-9\">{\u00b6 21} In <em>Wharf, </em>this court also noted in dicta that \u201cno use, display, or brandishing of a weapon, or intent to do any of the aforementioned acts, is necessary according to the plain language of [R.C. 2911.02(A)(1)].\u201d Id. Lester and his amicus curiae rely on this dicta in <em>Wharf </em>to support their argument that a defendant must act recklessly in displaying or brandishing a deadly weapon under R.C. 2911.01(A)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-10\">{\u00b6 22} As the amicus curiae, the public defender, points out, the aggravated-robbery statute at issue here was amended in 1996 to add the language \u201cdisplay the weapon, brandish it, indicate that the offender possesses it, or use it.\u201d Am.Sub.S.B. No. 2, 146 Ohio Laws, Part IV, 7136, 7278. The public defender argues that the additional language in the current aggravated-robbery statute suggests that the General Assembly intended to require that a defendant act with a specific intent to display the deadly weapon. Lester and the public defender point to <em>Wharf </em>to support that argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>{\u00b6 23} The state argues that <em>Wharfs </em>rationale applies to the aggravated-robbery statute and shows that the General Assembly did not impose a specific mens rea for the display or brandishing of a weapon under R.C. 2911.01(A)(1). The court in <em>Wharf </em>observed that \u201c [m]erely <em>having </em>the weapon is the potentially dangerous factual condition warranting the more severe penalty.* * *\u2019 (Emphasis in original.)\u201d 86 Ohio St.3d at 379, 715 N.E.2d 172, quoting <em>State v. Edwards </em>(1976), 50 Ohio App.2d 63, 67, 4 O.O.3d 44, 361 N.E.2d 1083. The state also argues that there is little difference between having a weapon in one\u2019s control and displaying it and that the risk of harm to the victim in either case is elevated because of the presence of the weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">{\u00b6 24} The statute\u2019s amendment in 1996 to add language requiring a defendant to brandish or display a deadly weapon in addition to the strict-liability requirement of possession and control of the deadly weapon does not establish that the General Assembly intended to require a specific mental element. A defendant\u2019s brandishing or displaying a deadly weapon elevates the risk to others in the vicinity of the robbery above the risk posed only by the possession or control of the deadly weapon. Cf. <em>Wharf, </em>86 Ohio St.3d at 379, 715 N.E.2d 172.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">{\u00b6 25} The statute here is distinguishable from the one at issue in <em>State v. Clay, </em>120 Ohio St.3d 528, 2008-Ohio-6325, 900 N.E.2d 1000, \u00b6 27. In that case, we held that for the purpose of proving the offense of having a weapon while under a disability pursuant to R.C. 2923.13(A)(3), the state had to show that the defendant acted recklessly with regard to his awareness that he was under indictment. 120 Ohio St.3d 528, 2008-Ohio-6325, 900 N.E.2d 1000, at syllabus. In <em>Clay, </em>we concluded that while the mere possession of a firearm was not unlawful, the additional fact of being under indictment made the act of possession criminal. When the additional fact makes innocent conduct criminal, as in <em>Clay, </em>it is unlikely that the General Assembly \u201cplainly intended\u201d to impose strict liability. By contrast, committing a theft offense is not innocent conduct. Consequently, it is reasonable that the General Assembly would impose strict liability on the additional circumstance of brandishing, displaying, using, or indicating possession of a deadly weapon, activity that enhances the seriousness of the criminal activity (from robbery, a second-degree felony, R.C. 2911.02(A)(1), to aggravated robbery, a first-degree felony, R.C. 2911.01(A)(1)).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-9\">{\u00b6 26} Because this court has recognized that mens rea is not required for the possession or control of a deadly weapon by a defendant in committing a robbery, <em>Wharf, </em>86 Ohio St.3d 375, 715 N.E.2d 172, it would be an anomaly to construe R.C. 2911.01(A)(1) to require proof of recklessness. Cf. R.C. 1.47(C) (in enacting a statute, it is presumed that a just and reasonable result is intended).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-10\">3.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>{\u00b6 27} As in <em>Wharf, </em>the risk of harm in this case \u201cquickly escalated due, in large measure, to a deadly weapon being readily accessible\u201d to the defendant. 86 Ohio St.3d at 380, 715 N.E.2d 172. When the victim pursued Lester to get his money back, Lester pulled out a knife and said, <em>\u201cI </em>know how to use this knife and I will cut you.\u201d The use of the knife to threaten the victim \u201cwas not a case of neglect, innocent mistake, or pure accident.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">{\u00b6 28} From the victim\u2019s perspective, or for that matter, from a bystander\u2019s perspective, the risk of harm increases when a defendant brandishes or displays the weapon. Cf. <em>Dean v. United States </em>(2009), \u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1849, 1855, 173 L.Ed.2d 785 (when defendant carried a firearm during a robbery, the fact that the discharge of the gun may have been accidental \u201cdoes not mean that the defendant is blameless\u201d for purposes of sentence enhancement). It is rational to conclude that the General Assembly imposed strict liability in R.C. 2911.01(A)(1) for the brandishing, display, or use-of-a-deadly-weapon element in an aggravated robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">4.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-9\">{\u00b6 29} Lester argues that under <em>Colon I, </em>the state must show that a defendant recklessly brandished, displayed, indicated possession of, or used the deadly weapon to prove a violation of the aggravated-robbery statute, R.C. 2911.01(A)(1). However, in <em>Colon I, </em>there was \u201cno dispute\u201d that the defendant\u2019s indictment for robbery in violation of R.C. 2911.02(A)(2) was defective for failure to allege a mens rea. 118 Ohio St.3d 26, 2008-Ohio-1624, 885 N.E.2d 917, \u00b6 10. \u201c[T]he state agree[d] that the omission in the indictment of one of the essential elements of the crime of robbery,\u201d i.e., the mens rea, rendered the indictment defective. Id. at \u00b6 15. This court concluded that R.C. 2911.02(A)(2) did not \u201cplainly indicate} ] a purpose to impose strict liability.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-10\">{\u00b6 30} Moreover, <em>Colon I </em>is not dispositive of the issue here. This case addresses the defendant\u2019s use, display, brandishing, or indicating possession of a deadly weapon under R.C. 2911.01(A)(1), unlike <em>Colon I, </em>which addressed the element of inflicting or threatening to inflict physical harm under R.C. 2911.02(A)(2). Additionally, as previously noted, the parties in <em>Colon I </em>did not contest the issue of whether R.C. 2911.02(A)(2) required a mens rea, and this court\u2019s discussion of that issue in <em>Colon I </em>consequently was limited.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-11\">{\u00b6 31} And contrary to the suggestion in <em>State v. Jones, </em>7th Dist. No. 07-MA-200, 2008-Ohio-6971, 2008 WL 5427964, this court\u2019s summary reversal and remand order on authority of <em>Colon I </em>in <em>State v. Davis, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 113, 2008-Ohio-3879, 892 N.E.2d 446, does not foreclose the conclusion we reach today regarding the aggravated-robbery statute. <em>Davis </em>involved an indictment for aggravated robbery under R.C. 2911.01(A)(1). Although the court of appeals\u2019 opinion in <em>Davis </em>stated that the indictment did not specifically state a mens rea, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>the court of appeals\u2019 opinion did not state what the omitted mens rea element was. See <em>State v. Davis, </em>8th Dist. No. 88895, 2007-Ohio-5843, 2007 WL 3203040, \u00b6 34-38. Our two-sentence ruling in <em>Davis </em>did not follow full briefing and argument, but it simply reversed and remanded without discussing whether aggravated robbery under R.C. 2911.01(A)(1) required a mens rea with regard to the element of brandishing, display, use, or indicating possession of a weapon. <em>Davis </em>does not prevent us from considering this issue after full briefing and argument and reaching the conclusion we announce today regarding the aggravated-robbery statute. See, e.g., <em>State v. Payne, </em>114 Ohio St.3d 502, 2007-Ohio-4642, 873 N.E.2d 306, \u00b6 9-10, 12 (summary-remand decision of this court does not settle for future cases unaddressed issues); see also <em>State ex rel. United Auto., Aerospace &amp; Agricultural Implement Workers of Am. v. Bur. of Workers\u2019 Comp., </em>108 Ohio St.3d 432, 2006-Ohio-1327, 844 N.E.2d 335, \u00b6 46. To the extent that our summary-reversal decision in <em>Davis </em>can be read as implicitly establishing a mens rea requirement for the element of brandishing, displaying, using, or indicating possession of a weapon in the aggravated robbery statute, R.C. 2911.01(A)(1), we reject that conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">{\u00b6 32} We are persuaded that the General Assembly, by not specifying a mens rea in R.C. 2911.01(A)(1), plainly indicated its purpose to impose strict liability as to the element of displaying, brandishing, indicating possession of, or using a deadly weapon. Cf. R.C. 2901.21(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">{\u00b6 33} We hold that the state is not required to charge a mens rea for this element of the crime of aggravated robbery under R.C. 2911.01(A)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">{\u00b6 34} We reverse the judgment below and reinstate Lester\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-9\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b517-10\">Moyer, C.J., and Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, and O\u2019Donnell, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"AE_\">Pfeifer and Lanzinger, JJ., concur in judgment only.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b512-8\">.

Colon, </em>118 Ohio St.3d 26, 2008-Ohio-1624, 885 N.E.2d 917 <em>(\u201cColon I\u201d), </em>and <em>State v. Colon, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 204, 2008-Ohio-3749, 893 N.E.2d 169 <em>(\u201cColon II\u201d). </em>Previously, an indictment that tracked the statute would have been deemed sufficient to provide the notice that an accused needed to defend himself. <em>State v. Buehner, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 403, 2006-Ohio-4707, 853 N.E.2d 1162. Now, every indictment that does not specify the degree of culpability for each statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>element is subject to challenge for the first time on appeal. This is a boon to defendants, a headache to appellate courts, and a nightmare to prosecutors.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">{\u00b6 36} And so the major question to be decided is the consequence of the missing mens rea in this indictment. I do not agree that the General Assembly has <em>plainly indicated </em>an intention to impose a standard of strict liability upon the element of brandishing, displaying, using, or indicating possession of a deadly weapon in an aggravated robbery charged under R.C. 2911.01(A)(1) and thus would hold that the mens rea of recklessness \u2014 the default culpability standard\u2014 applies. Nevertheless, I concur in the judgment to reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and reinstate Lester\u2019s conviction, although for altogether different reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">The Purpose of an Indictment</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">{\u00b6 37} The purpose of an indictment issued by a grand jury has always been to give notice to the accused: \u201c[A] criminal offense must be charged with reasonable certainty in the indictment so as to apprise the defendant of that which he may expect to meet and be required to answer; so that the court and jury may know what they are to try, and the court may determine without unreasonable difficulty what evidence is admissible.\u201d <em>Horton v. State </em>(1911), 85 Ohio St. 13, 19, 96 N.E. 797.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">{\u00b6 38} As recently as in <em>State v. Buehner, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 403, 2006-Ohio-4707, 853 N.E.2d 1162, we explained:</p>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">{\u00b6 39} \u2018\u201cUnder Crim.R. 7(B), an indictment \u201cmay be made in ordinary and concise language without technical averments or allegations not essential to be proved. The statement <em>may be in the words of the applicable section of the statute, provided the words of that statute charge an offense, </em>or in words sufficient to give the defendant notice of all the elements of the offense with which the defendant is charged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b518-9\">{\u00b6 40} \u201c \u2018An indictment meets constitutional requirements if it \u201cfirst, contains the elements of the offense charged and fairly informs a defendant of the charge against which he must defend, and, second, enables him to plead an acquittal or conviction in bar of future prosecutions for the same offense.\u201d \u2019 \u201d Id. at \u00b6 8-9, quoting <em>State v. Childs </em>(2000), 88 Ohio St.3d 558, 564-565, 728 N.E.2d 379, quoting <em>Hamling v. United States </em>(1974), 418 U.S. 87, 117-118, 94 S.Ct. 2887, 41 L.Ed.2d 590.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-10\">{\u00b6 41} Until <em>Colon I </em>and <em>II, </em>the typical indictment that recited the language of a criminal statute as written was presumed to give appropriate notice to the accused of the charge that was to be defended against. Furthermore, if a question existed, a bill of particulars could be requested, and a motion to amend the indictment could always be filed under Crim.R. 7(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>The <em>Colon </em>Complications</p>\n<p id=\"AYP\">{\u00b6 42} In <em>Colon I </em>and <em>II, </em>for the first time, the court decided that a defective indictment could lead to structural error because it omitted the required mens rea for robbery charged under R.C. 2911.02(A)(2), even though the indictment tracked the statute under which Colon was charged. The majority in <em>Colon I </em>determined that the defendant had no notice that the state was required to prove that he had been reckless in inflicting, threatening to inflict, or attempting to inflict physical harm on another while committing or attempting to commit a theft offense. <em>Colon I, </em>118 Ohio St.3d 26, 2008-Ohio-1624, 885 N.E.2d 917, at \u00b6 30. The <em>Colon I </em>majority further decided that the defendant was misled even though recklessness is the default standard listed in R.C. 2901.21(B), the criminal statute on culpability, and even though R.C. 2901.22(E) provides, \u201cWhen recklessness suffices to establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also sufficient culpability for such element.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">{\u00b6 43} The majority opinion in this case states, <em>\u201cColon II </em>clarified that the omission of the mens rea element from an indictment does not require automatic reversal if the trial court properly instructs the jury.\u201d But in fact, <em>Colon II </em>has complicated criminal appeals even further. Although harsh, <em>Colon I </em>seemed to require reversal without exception when an indictment lacked a mens rea for an element of the crime; <em>Colon II </em>backed away from automatic reversal and requires an appellate court to look further at jury instructions in addition to making the determination of whether a \u201cspecific level of culpability\u201d is required for an element of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">The Effect of a Missing Mens Rea</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">{\u00b6 44} Formerly, legislative silence as to mens rea in a statute defining an offense had been interpreted as an indication of the purpose to impose strict liability. See, e.g., <em>State v. Lisbon Sales Book Co. </em>(1964), 176 Ohio St. 482, 27 O.O.2d 443, 200 N.E.2d 590, paragraph two of the syllabus. However, the rule was modified in 1974, when the General Assembly repealed former R.C. 2901.21 and enacted a new statute expressing how mens rea, i.e., level of \u201cguilt,\u201d is to be established. R.C. 2901.21 now provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">{\u00b6 45} \u201c(A) Except as provided in division (B) of this section, a person is not guilty of an offense unless both of the following apply:</p>\n<p id=\"b519-9\">{\u00b6 46} \u201c(1) The person\u2019s liability is based on conduct that includes either a voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is capable of performing;</p>\n<p id=\"b519-10\">{\u00b6 47} \u201c(2) The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the section defining the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>{\u00b6 48} \u201c(B) When the section defining an offense does not specify any degree of culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not required for a person to be guilty of the offense. When the section neither specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability, recklessness is sufficient culpability to commit the offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">{\u00b6 49} Thus, when a particular culpability standard is not expressed for an element of an offense and the statute does not plainly indicate a purpose to impose strict liability, proof of recklessness is sufficient. <em>State v. Schlosser </em>(1997), 79 Ohio St.3d 329, 331, 681 N.E.2d 911. Recklessness was understood to be the default mens rea standard before the <em>Colon </em>cases. Now, the majority suggests that each time a statute fails to specify mens rea, there is an intention to impose strict criminal liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">{\u00b6 50} But the majority\u2019s method of determining strict liability means we will not be taking the General Assembly at its own word, i.e., that recklessness is the default mens rea. This court should not be rewriting statutes. The legislature should determine what acts must be done with some degree of culpability and what acts require no guilty mind at all but are offenses for which a person is strictly liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">Plain Indication of Strict Liability</p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">{\u00b6 51} The majority turns the R.C. 2901.21(B) analysis completely around by stating that the 1996 amendment to R.C. 2913.01 that added language prohibiting the brandishing or displaying of a deadly weapon to language prohibiting its possession and control does not establish \u201cthat the General Assembly <em>intended to require a specific mental intent.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) R.C. 2901.21(B) clearly provides that when an expressed standard of culpability is missing, we are to discover whether the section under discussion \u201cplainly <em>indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal liability.\u201d </em>In contravention of this statutory language, the majority changes the focus of the inquiry from whether there is a plain indication of a purpose to impose strict liability to whether there is an intention to require a specific mental intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-9\">{\u00b6 52} In its analysis, the majority relies upon <em>State v. Wharf </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 375, 715 N.E.2d 172. In <em>Wharf, </em>this court construed R.C. 2911.02(A)(1) and the robbery element that provides that no person attempting or committing a theft offense or fleeing immediately after the attempt or offense shall \u201chave a deadly weapon on or about the offender\u2019s person or under the offender\u2019s control\u201d as a strict liability element. Id. at 378, 715 N.E.2d 172. The court concluded that a mental state with regard to the weapon need not be proven: \u201cFurthermore, one need not have the weapon in one\u2019s possession or under one\u2019s control while committing or attempting to commit a theft offense. A violation of R.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>2911.02(A)(1) will also be found if the offender has a deadly weapon on or about his person, or under his control, while fleeing after such offense or attempt. <em>Thus, no use, display, or brandishing of a weapon, or intent to do any of the aforementioned acts, is necessary </em>according to the plain language of the statute. <em>Had the legislature so intended, it certainly could have required a level of conduct more severe </em>than it did in order to show a violation of the statute.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">{\u00b6 53} The legislature seems to have done exactly that in R.C. 2911.01(A)(1) where, in addition to requiring that the offender have a deadly weapon on or about the offender\u2019s person or under the offender\u2019s control, the statute also requires that the person \u201ceither display the weapon, brandish it, indicate that the offender possesses it, or use it.\u201d R.C. 2911.01(A)(1). The existence of this additional language, which the court in <em>Wharf </em>specifically noted was lacking in R.C. 2911.02(A)(1), is an indication of \u201ca level of conduct more severe\u201d than merely possessing or having a weapon under one\u2019s control. The missing mens rea, therefore, expresses that the default mental state of recklessness is imposed in R.C. 2901.21(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">{\u00b6 54} Before <em>Wharf, </em>this court was consistent in applying R.C. 2901.21(B). For example, we recognized a \u201cplain indication\u201d of a purpose to impose strict liability in R.C. 2915.02(A)(1), which prohibits bookmaking, and R.C. 2915.03(A)(1), which prohibits the use of a person\u2019s premises for gambling. See <em>State v. Wac </em>(1981), 68 Ohio St.2d 84, 86-87, 22 O.O.3d 299, 428 N.E.2d 428. The General Assembly had expressly differentiated degrees of culpability, specifying \u201cknowingly\u201d and \u201crecklessly\u201d in portions of the statute, but did not specify the degree of culpability in prohibiting bookmaking or the use of one\u2019s premises for gambling. The court concluded in <em>Wac, </em>\u201cThe General Assembly included the culpable mental state of \u2018knowingly\u2019 as an element of facilitating bookmaking. Nevertheless, there is no such requirement in the same subsection for bookmaking per se. This exclusion \u2018plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal liability * * R.C. 2901.21(B).\u201d Id. at 86, 22 O.O.3d 299, 428 N.E.2d 428. And in addressing the gambling statute, we stated, \u201cThe General Assembly included recklessness as an element of permitting gambling on one\u2019s premises in subsection (2) [of R.C. 2915.03]. Subsection (1), however, does not contain a comparable standard. This exclusion \u2018plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal liability * * *.\u2019 R.C. 2901.12(B).\u201d Id. at 87, 22 O.O.3d 299, 428 N.E.2d 428.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">{\u00b6 55} In other cases, it was also confirmed that the lack of any expressed mental state means that the standard applicable to the offense is recklessness. See <em>State v. Parrish </em>(1984), 12 Ohio St.3d 123, 124, 12 OBR 164, 465 N.E.2d 873 (because the statute does not expressly differentiate degrees of culpability, \u201cthe participants in the crime of prostitution addressed in R.C. 2907.25(A) must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>possess some degree of criminal intent to be found guilty of either the principal offense or of complicity\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">(\u00b6 56} In <em>State v. Lozier, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 161, 2004-Ohio-732, 803 N.E.2d 770, the definition of the phrase \u201ccommitted in the vicinity of a school\u201d was compared to the phrase \u201ccommitted in the vicinity of a juvenile\u201d to determine whether \u201cin the vicinity of a school\u201d is a strict liability element in the offense of trafficking in LSD under R.C. 2925.03(C)(5)(b). A person trafficking in LSD in the \u201cvicinity of a juvenile\u201d is liable \u201cwhether the offender knows the age of the juvenile, whether the offender knows the offense is being committed within one hundred feet of or within view of the juvenile, or whether the juvenile actually views the commission of the offense.\u201d R.C. 2925.01(BB). We stated that this language \u201cmakes it abundantly clear that the offender\u2019s mental state is irrelevant in determining whether the offender has committed an offense \u2018in the vicinity of a juvenile.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lozier, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 161, 2004-Ohio-732, 803 N.E.2d 770, at \u00b6 36. In contrast, \u201c[a]n offense is \u2018committed in the vicinity of a school\u2019 if the offender commits the offense on school premises, in a school building, or within one thousand feet of the boundaries of any school premises.\u201d R.C. 2925.01(P). Because the latter definition did not include the knowledge language included in R.C. 2925.01(BB), the General Assembly did not indicate a purpose to impose strict liability to trafficking in LSD in the vicinity of a school, and the default mental state of recklessness applied. Id. at \u00b6 45.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">{\u00b6 57} We have also properly applied R.C. 2901.21(B) in repeatedly holding that the \u201c[e]xistence of the culpable mental state of recklessness is an essential element of the crime of endangering children.\u201d <em>State v. Adams </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St.2d 151, 16 O.O.3d 169, 404 N.E.2d 144, paragraph one of the syllabus (holding that R.C. 2919.22(B)(2) neither specifies a mental state nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability); <em>State v. O\u2019Brien </em>(1987), 30 Ohio St.3d 122, 30 OBR 436, 508 N.E.2d 144, paragraph one of the syllabus (construing R.C. 2919.22(B)(3)); <em>State v. McGee </em>(1997), 79 Ohio St.3d 193, 680 N.E.2d 975 (construing R.C. 2919.22(A)). In these cases, this court noted that in each of the subsections of the statute, the General Assembly did not specify any degree of culpability or plainly indicate a purpose to impose strict liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">{\u00b6 58} Because R.C. 2911.01(A) does not specify a degree of culpability and does not plainly indicate a purpose to impose strict liability, I would hold that recklessness is the degree of culpability for the element of brandishing, displaying, using, or indicating possession of a deadly weapon in the offense of aggravated robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">Resolution</p>\n<p id=\"b522-9\">{\u00b6 59} I would frankly call the <em>Colon </em>cases aberrant. <em>Colon I </em>and <em>II </em>render Crim.R. 7(D) and 12(C) and R.C. 2941.29 meaningless. Lester did not raise the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>issue of a defective indictment at any time during the pendency of the proceedings before the trial court. Had he raised the issue in the trial court, Crim.R. 7(D) would have allowed the state to seek the amendment of the indictment to include the mens rea and would have allowed Lester to move for a discharge of the jury had he been misled or prejudiced by the defect. <em>O\u2019Brien, </em>30 Ohio St.3d at 125-127, 508 N.E.2d 144. Under Crim.R. 12(C)(2), objections to defects in an indictment must be raised before trial, except for objections to the failure to show jurisdiction in the court or to charge an offense, which may be raised at any time during the pendency of the proceeding.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A-O\">Joseph T. Deters, Hamilton County Prosecuting Attorney, and Tanner B. McFall, Assistant Prosecuting Attorney, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b523-10\">Christine Y. Jones, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b523-11\">Timothy Young, State Public Defender, and Spencer Cahoon, Assistant State Public Defender, urging affirmance for amicus curiae, Ohio Public Defender.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">{\u00b6 60} In addition, R.C. 2941.29 provides, \u201cNo indictment or information shall be quashed, set aside, or dismissed, or motion to quash be sustained, or any motion for delay of sentence for the purpose of review be granted, nor shall any conviction be set aside or reversed on account of any defect in form or substance of the indictment or information, unless the objection to such indictment or information, specifically stating the defect claimed, is made prior to the commencement of the trial, or at such time thereafter as the court permits.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">{\u00b6 61} Reverting to <em>pre-Colon </em>precedent will reinstate the importance of the two criminal rules and the statute. Reviewing courts will not be faced with the issue of defective indictments for the first time on appellate review. They will not be tempted to save convictions by holding that an indictment missing a mens rea indicates a strict liability element rather than an element with the default culpability of recklessness.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">{\u00b6 62} I would reinstate Lester\u2019s conviction because any error in the indictment was not called to the attention of the trial court at a time when the error could have been corrected by the trial court. Therefore, the objection to the defect was waived. I concur in judgment only.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
