Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">{\u00b6 2} In the early morning hours of September 8, 2006, Deputy Kelly S. Nawman stopped a car after she saw it cross the center line by a tire\u2019s width. Upon approaching the vehicle, she detected a strong scent of intoxicants. Corey Hoover, the appellee and cross-appellant in this case, was the driver. He admitted to having drunk some alcohol before driving, and he performed poorly on the field sobriety tests. Hoover was then arrested and was read his <em>Miranda </em>rights. After being taken to the Union County Sheriffs Office, he was asked to submit to a breath-alcohol test, but he refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">{\u00b6 3} Hoover was charged with violating R.C. 4511.19(A)(2), which enhances the sentence for a DUI conviction if the offender refuses to submit to a chemical test and has been convicted of a DUI violation within the past 20 years. Hoover pleaded not guilty to the charge and moved for dismissal, claiming that the refusal provision and its corresponding sentence enhancement violated his constitutional rights under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Section 14, Article I of the Ohio Constitution and further violated his right to due process under the United States and Ohio Constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-9\">{\u00b6 4} The trial court overruled the motion to dismiss, and Hoover entered a no-contest plea. The court found Hoover guilty, and because he had a prior DUI conviction within the previous six years, sentenced him to 60 days in jail (with 40 days suspended) under R.C. 4511.19(G)(1)(b)(ii), which requires imposition of a jail term of at least 20 days upon a defendant who violates R.C. 4511.19(A)(2) and has had a previous DUI conviction within the past six years. If Hoover had refused to consent to a chemical test but had been convicted of DUI under R.C. 4511.19(A)(1), which does not include the element of refusing to consent, his mandatory minimum jail time would have been ten days. The trial court stayed the sentence pending Hoover\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-10\">{\u00b6 5} On October 29, 2007, the Third District Court of Appeals reversed the judgment of the trial court, in part. It held that the enhanced sentencing under R.C. 4511.19(G)(1)(b)(ii) for a violation of R.C. 4511.19(A)(2) unconstitutionally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>punished Hoover for asserting his right to decline a search. The court severed from R.C. 4511.19(G)(1)(b)(ii) the portion of the statute that set forth the penalty for a violation of R.C. 4511.19(A)(2), thereby omitting a sentence provision for a violation of R.C. 4511.19(A)(2). The court held: \u201cSince no sentence is provided, the statute must be interpreted against the state, and the defendant is entitled to the lesser sentence of all of the offenses which are sentenced pursuant to R.C. 4511.19(G)(1)(b). Because of the prior conviction, the defendant will properly be sentenced under R.C. 4511.19(G)(1)(b)(i).\u201d <em>State v. Hoover, </em>173 Ohio App.3d 487, 2007-Ohio-5773, 878 N.E.2d 1116, \u00b6 8. That statute imposes a mandatory minimum jail term of ten days on a defendant with a DUI conviction within the last six years. Thus, the appellate court affirmed Hoover\u2019s conviction for a violation of R.C. 4511.19(A)(2), but reversed the trial court\u2019s imposition of the sentence imposed pursuant to R.C. 4511.19(G)(1)(b)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">{\u00b6 6} Both parties appealed. The state argues that the court of appeals erred in finding the sentence enhancement unconstitutional; Hoover argues that his conviction should have been overturned because the court should have declared R.C. 4511.19(A)(2) unconstitutional in its entirety, rather than just the related sentencing enhancement contained in R.C. 4511.19(G)(1)(b)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">{\u00b6 7} The case is now before us upon the acceptance of a discretionary appeal and cross-appeal. <em>State v. Hoover, </em>117 Ohio St.3d 1496, 2008-Ohio-2028, 885 N.E.2d 954.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">II. Law and Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b534-8\">{\u00b6 8} We first acknowledge that statutes enjoy a strong presumption of constitutionality. <em>State v. Carswell, </em>114 Ohio St.3d 210, 2007-Ohio-3723, 871 N.E.2d 547, \u00b6 6; <em>State v. Collier </em>(1991), 62 Ohio St.3d 267, 269, 581 N.E.2d 552. A statute will be upheld unless the challenger can meet the burden of establishing beyond a reasonable doubt that the statute is unconstitutional. <em>State v. Tooley, </em>114 Ohio St.3d 366, 2007-Ohio-3698, 872 N.E.2d 894, \u00b6 29; <em>Collier </em>at 269.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-9\">\n<em>A. The Criminal Statute</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b534-10\">{\u00b6 9} Hoover argues that R.C. 4511.19(A)(2)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> violates his rights under the federal and state constitutions. The statute provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b534-11\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cNo person who, within twenty years of the conduct described in division (A)(2)(a) of this section, previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to a violation of this division, a violation of division (A)(1) or (B) of this section, or a municipal OYI offense shall do both of the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b535-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>{\u00b6 11} \u201c(a) Operate any vehicle * * * within this state while under the influence of alcohol, a drug of abuse, or a combination of them;</p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\">{\u00b6 12} \u201c(b) Subsequent to being arrested for operating the vehicle * * *, being asked by a law enforcement officer to submit to a chemical test or tests under [R.C. 4511.191], and being advised by the officer in accordance with [R.C. 4511.192] of the consequences of the person\u2019s refusal or submission to the test or tests, refuse to submit to the test or tests.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">{\u00b6 13} There are three elements of a charge brought pursuant to R.C. 4511.19(A)(2): (1) a DUI conviction within 20 years of the current violation, (2) operation of a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or drugs, and (3) a refusal to submit to a chemical test while under arrest for the current DUI. R.C. 4511.19(A)(1)\u2019s only element is the operation a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">\n<em>B. The Implied-Consent Statute</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">{\u00b6 14} R.C. 4511.19(A)(2) contains references to R.C. 4511.191, Ohio\u2019s implied-consent statute. As part of obtaining the privilege to drive in Ohio, a driver implicitly consents to a search, through means of a chemical test, to determine the amount of intoxicating substances in the driver\u2019s body upon the driver\u2019s arrest for DUI. R.C. 4511.191(A)(2) states:</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cAny person who operates a vehicle * * * within this state * * * shall be deemed to have given consent to a chemical test or tests of the person\u2019s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine to determine the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or combination content of the person\u2019s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine if arrested for a violation of division (A) or (B) of [R.C. 4511.19] * *</p>\n<p id=\"b535-9\">{\u00b6 16} Furthermore, under R.C. 4511.191(B), every driver, regardless of previous offenses, also faces an administrative license suspension (\u201cALS\u201d) for failing to submit to a chemical test upon an arresting officer\u2019s reasonable belief of a DUI violation. The penalties for refusing to submit to a test are set forth in R.C. 4511.191(B) and run the range from a one-year suspension for first-time offenders to a five-year suspension for persons who have refused a chemical test three or more times within six years of the current offense. Under the current version of R.C. 4511.191(B), which was not in effect at the time of Hoover\u2019s arrest, there is also a difference in degree of penalty for persons, like Hoover, who have had a DUI conviction within six years of the current offense \u2014 they face a two-year license suspension for failure to submit to testing, regardless of whether they had previously refused a test.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>{\u00b6 17} In <em>State v. Starnes </em>(1970), 21 Ohio St.2d 38, 50 O.O.2d 84, 254 N.E.2d 675, paragraph one of the syllabus, this court found the implied-consent statute to be constitutional:</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cSection 4511.191, Revised Code, does not violate the search and seizure provision of the Fourth Amendment, nor the self-incrimination clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution by providing that any operator of a motor vehicle upon the public highways in this state shall be deemed to have given consent to a chemical test to determine the alcoholic content of his blood if arrested for the offense of driving while under the influence of alcohol. <em>(Schmerber v. California </em>[1966], 384 U.S. 757 [86 S.Ct. 1826, 16 L.Ed.2d 908]; <em>Westerville v. Cunningham </em>[1968], 15 Ohio St.2d 121 [44 O.O.2d 119, 239 N.E.2d 40], applied.)\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">{\u00b6 19} The United States Supreme Court has held that if an officer has probable cause to arrest a driver for DUI, the result of an analysis of a blood sample taken over the driver\u2019s objection and without consent is admissible in evidence, even if no warrant had been obtained. <em>Schmerber v. California </em>(1966), 384 U.S. 757, 86 S.Ct. 1826, 16 L.Ed.2d 908. The court noted that delaying the test to get a warrant would result in a loss of evidence. Id. at 770-771, 86 S.Ct. 1826, 16 L.Ed.2d 908. Following <em>Schmerber, </em>we held that \u201c[o]ne accused of intoxication has no constitutional right to refuse to take a reasonably reliable chemical test for intoxication.\u201d <em>Westerville v. Cunningham </em>(1968), 15 Ohio St.2d 121, 44 O.O.2d 119, 239 N.E.2d 40, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">\n<em>C. Refusal to Consent</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">{\u00b6 20} To summarize, a driver\u2019s refusal to submit to chemical testing when arrested on probable cause for DUI can result in two consequences. The driver receives an ALS under R.C. 4511.191(B), and if the driver is convicted of the DUI charge and had a previous DUI conviction in the past 20 years, his or her sentence will be enhanced under R.C. 4511.19(G).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-9\">{\u00b6 21} It is crucial to note that the refusal to consent to testing is not, itself, a criminal offense. The activity prohibited under R.C. 4511.19(A)(2) is operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of drugs or alcohol. A person\u2019s refusal to take a chemical test is simply an additional element that must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt along with the person\u2019s previous DUI conviction to distinguish the offense from a violation of R.C. 4511.19(A)(1)(a). Hoover\u2019s conviction under R.C. 4511.19(A)(2) meant that the mandatory minimum jail term increased from ten days, the mandatory minimum for R.C. 4511.19(A)(1)(a), to 20 days. R.C. 4511.19(G)(1)(b)(i) and (ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-10\">{\u00b6 22} Hoover contends, however, that he has a constitutional right to revoke his implied consent and that being forced by threat of punishment to submit to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>chemical test violates his rights under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article I, Section 14 of the Ohio Constitution, which provide that persons, houses, and effects are protected against unreasonable search and seizure. However, Hoover has no constitutional right to refuse to take a reasonably reliable chemical test for intoxication. See <em>Cunningham, </em>15 Ohio St.2d 121, 44 O.O.2d 119, 239 N.E.2d 40, paragraph two of the syllabus; <em>Schmerber, </em>384 U.S. at 770-771, 86 S.Ct. 1826, 16 L.Ed.2d 908. Asking a driver to comply with conduct he has no right to refuse and thereafter enhancing a later sentence upon conviction does not violate the constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">{\u00b6 23} Furthermore, the request to submit to a chemical test does not occur until after probable cause to arrest exists. In this case, the arresting officer pulled Hoover over after she saw him drive across the center line. She smelled a strong odor of intoxicants as she approached his car. Hoover admitted that he had been drinking. He then performed poorly on field sobriety tests. Because R.C. 4511.19(A)(2) requires that an officer have probable cause to arrest for DUI before requesting that a driver undergo chemical testing and because the United States Supreme Court has held that exigent circumstances justify the warrantless seizure of a blood sample in DUI cases, <em>Schmerber, </em>it is clear that R.C. 4511.19(A)(2) does not violate the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution or Article I, Section 14 of the Ohio Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">{\u00b6 24} This court\u2019s statement in <em>State v. Gustafson </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 425, 439, 668 N.E.2d 435, referring to an ALS suspension for refusing to consent, also holds true under these circumstances: \u201c[T]he act of refusing a chemical test for alcohol, standing alone, does not constitute a criminal \u2018offense\u2019 of any kind. Ohio police officers are not statutorily authorized to randomly demand chemical alcohol testing of Ohio drivers in the absence of an arrest for DUI, and there is no criminal charge which can be lodged for the act of refusing a chemical test. Nor does R.C. 4511.191 authorize imposition of an ALS based solely on a driver\u2019s refusal to take a chemical test. Rather, the implied consent statute authorizes a police officer to ask a driver to undergo a chemical test for alcohol <em>only where the officer has first determined that probable cause exists for arrest for the offense of driving while intoxicated.\u201d </em>(Emphasis sic.)</p>\n<p id=\"b537-8\">{\u00b6 25} An administrative license suspension is an automatic consequence of a refusal to take a chemical test. R.C. 4511.191(B)(1). But imposing an ALS for refusal to take a chemical test does not preclude using the refusal as an element to enhance a DUI sentence. In <em>Gustafson, </em>we held that the punishment allowed under Ohio\u2019s implied-consent law did not violate the constitutional principle of double jeopardy. 76 Ohio St.3d 425, 668 N.E.2d 435. Both an ALS and a criminal prosecution may result from driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol and refusing to take the chemical test. After a DUI conviction, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>the ALS terminates, and the license suspension becomes part of the DUI sentence. Id. at paragraphs four and five of the syllabus. We recognized in <em>Gustafson </em>that both administrative regulation and criminal prosecution play a part in ensuring safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">{\u00b6 26} Furthermore, we have held that \u201c[i]n Ohio, a license to operate a motor vehicle is a privilege, and not an absolute property right.\u201d <em>Doyle v. Ohio Bur. of Motor Vehicles </em>(1990), 51 Ohio St.3d 46, 554 N.E.2d 97, paragraph two of the syllabus. \u201c \u2018The state has the right under its sovereign power to control automobile traffic by reasonable regulations of the circumstances under which its citizens may be licensed to operate a motor vehicle and to adopt appropriate provisions to insure competence and care on the part of licensees, to protect others using the highways; and any appropriate means adopted does not deny to a person subject to its provisions any constitutional rights under the Constitution of the United States or the state of Ohio.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 51, 554 N.E.2d 97, fn. 6, quoting <em>State v. Newkirk </em>(1968), 21 Ohio App.2d 160, 165, 50 O.O.2d 253, 255 N.E.2d 851.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">{\u00b6 27} The subsection under which Hoover was charged, R.C. 4511.19(A)(2), was added to the Revised Code by Am.Sub.H.B. No. 163, 150 Ohio Laws, Part III, 4620, 4705, effective September 23, 2004. Its enactment shows the legislature\u2019s concern with the problems of both repeat drunk drivers and chemical-test refusals. The General Assembly addressed these problems by enhancing the sentence for a DUI conviction when the driver refuses to be tested and has previously been convicted of a DUI.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">{\u00b6 28} The dissent argues that this court has already answered the question before us in <em>Wilson v. Cincinnati </em>(1976), 46 Ohio St.2d 138, 75 O.O.2d 190, 346 N.E.2d 666. That case, however, is readily distinguishable. First, <em>Wilson </em>involved a homeowner\u2019s failure to tender a certificate of housing inspection to a prospective buyer, hardly analogous to a DUI arrest. Second, property owners in the city of Cincinnati were required by city ordinance to have them property inspected by city officials before any sale of them property. An inspection was required even if there was no indication that the property violated any provision of the building code. Failure to have the property inspected exposed the owners to criminal sanctions. Unlike the property inspections in <em>Wilson, </em>the chemical test under discussion is not required until after probable cause to arrest exists. Finally, the property owners in <em>Wilson </em>had a right to refuse to consent to the search of their homes. But as we previously stated, Hoover did not have a right to refuse to take a reasonably reliable chemical test for intoxication. See <em>Cunningham, </em>15 Ohio St.2d 121, 44 O.O.2d 119, 239 N.E.2d 40, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"Ay2j\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>{\u00b629} Our conclusion that R.C. 4511.19(A)(2) does not violate the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution is also in line with decisions from other jurisdictions. See <em>State v. Netland </em>(Minn.2009), 762 N.W.2d 202; <em>Rowley v. Virginia </em>(2006), 48 Va.App. 181, 629 S.E.2d 188; <em>Burnett v. Anchorage </em>(Alaska App.1984) 678 P.2d 1364.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">{\u00b6 30} We hold that R.C. 4511.19(A)(2) does not violate the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution or Section 14, Article I of the Ohio Constitution. We therefore affirm the portion of the court of appeals judgment upholding Hoover\u2019s conviction under R.C. 4511.19(A)(2), but reverse the court of appeals judgment with respect to sentencing. We reinstate the trial court\u2019s sentence imposed upon Hoover pursuant to R.C. 4511.19(G)(1)(b)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">Judgment affirmed in part and reversed in part.</p>\n<judges id=\"b539-7\">Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b539-8\">Moyer, C.J., and Pfeifer and O\u2019Donnell, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b533-11\">. \u201cDUI\u201d seems to be the most popular term, but \u201cOMVI\u201d (operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated) and \u201cOVI\u201d (operating a vehicle while under the influence) are also used to refer to these offenses.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b534-12\">.

R.C. 4511.19(A)(2) veers from the traditional administrative punishment for refusal to consent to a chemical test upon an arrest for DUI and goes down a separate path, beyond the regulation of licensing; for certain DUI arrestees, R.C. 4511.19(A)(2) criminalizes the refusal to take a chemical test. Since imposing a criminal penalty for refusing to consent infringes on a suspect\u2019s rights under Section 14, Article I of the Ohio Constitution and the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-11\">{\u00b6 32} This court\u2019s previous cases regarding sanctions for a DUI defendant\u2019s failure to consent to chemical tests have all involved license suspensions: \u201cThis court has historically and repeatedly characterized driver\u2019s license suspensions imposed pursuant to Ohio\u2019s implied consent statutes as being civil in nature and remedial in purpose.\u201d <em>State v. Gustafson </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 425, 440, 668 N.E.2d 435. Moreover, in <em>Gtistafson, </em>this court held that \u201cthe act of refusing a chemical test for alcohol, standing alone, does not constitute a criminal \u2018offense\u2019 of any kind.\u201d Id. at 439, 668 N.E.2d 435.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-12\">{\u00b6 33} The majority states in \u00b6 21, \u201cIt is crucial to note that the refusal to consent to testing is not, itself, a criminal offense.\u201d Rather than crucial, that point is insignificant: R.C. 4511.19(A)(2) makes the refusal to consent to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>chemical test a <em>central element </em>of a criminal offense. Without a failure to consent, there is no crime committed under R.C. 4511.19(A)(2). The majority writes in \u00b6 21, \u201cThe activity prohibited under R.C. 4511.19(A)(2) is operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of drugs or alcohol.\u201d Wrong: operating a motor vehicle while under the influence is the activity prohibited under R.C. 4511.19(A)(1). R.C. 4511.19(A)(2) prohibits persons with a DUI conviction within the preceding 20 years from refusing to consent to a chemical test <em>after </em>being arrested for operating a vehicle while under the influence of drugs or alcohol. The simple fact is that for defendants like Hoover, the failure to consent results in jail time.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">(\u00b6 34} The majority relies heavily upon this court\u2019s decision in <em>Westerville v. Cunningham </em>(1968), 15 Ohio St.2d 121, 44 O.O.2d 119, 239 N.E.2d 40, wherein the court held that \u201c[o]ne accused of intoxication has no constitutional right to refuse to take a reasonably reliable chemical test for intoxication.\u201d Id. at paragraph two of the syllabus. But that case concerned a defendant\u2019s assertion of his <em>Fifth </em>Amendment rights; the defendant in <em>Cunningham </em>argued that using his refusal to submit to a chemical test as evidence against him in a trial would violate his right not to incriminate himself. Hoover asserts here that R.C. 4511.19(A)(2) violates his <em>Fourth </em>Amendment rights, and his is not an evidentiary concern \u2014 his <em>liberty </em>is at stake.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">{\u00b6 35} This court has previously answered the question whether a person can face <em>criminal </em>sanctions for failure to consent to a search. In <em>Wilson v. Cincinnati </em>(1976), 46 Ohio St.2d 138, 75 O.O.2d 190, 346 N.E.2d 666, this court held that the Fourth Amendment prohibits the imposition of criminal penalties upon a person who refuses to submit to a warrantless search. As here, the defendant in <em>Wilson </em>\u201cfaced * * * a serious dilemma; either [she had to] consent to a warrantless search or face the possibility of a criminal penalty.\u201d <em>Wilson </em>at 143, 346 N.E.2d 666. The ordinance at issue in <em>Wilson </em>required a homeowner, prior to entering into a contract for the sale of her property, to tender to the prospective buyer a certificate of housing inspection. A seller\u2019s failure to comply with the certificate requirement rendered the seller subject to a criminal penalty. Fourth Amendment rights were implicated because sellers could obtain the certificate only by allowing a city inspector to access their property. Thus, in order to sell his or her property, a seller had to consent to a warrantless search or face the possibility of a criminal penalty. This court held in <em>Wilson:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">{\u00b6 36} \u201cWhere a municipal ordinance requires the owner of real property to tender a certificate of housing inspection to a prospective buyer, and such certificate may be obtained only by allowing a warrantless inspection of the property, the imposition of a criminal penalty upon the owner\u2019s failure to tender the certificate violates the owner\u2019s rights under the Fourth Amendment to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>United States Constitution.\u201d <em>Wilson, </em>46 Ohio St.2d at 138, 75 O.O.2d 190, 346 N.E.2d 666, at syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">{\u00b6 37} As this court noted in <em>Wilson, </em>\u201c[generally, a search to which an individual consents meets Fourth Amendment requirements. <em>Katz v. United States </em>(1967), 389 U.S. 347, 358 [88 S.Ct. 507, 19 L.Ed.2d 576].\u201d <em>Wilson, </em>46 Ohio St.2d at 143, 75 O.O.2d 190, 346 N.E.2d 666. However, consent given in response to coercion does not meet Fourth Amendment requirements: \u201c[A] valid consent involves a waiver of constitutional rights and cannot be lightly inferred; hence, it must be \u2018voluntary and uncoerced, either physically or psychologically.\u2019 <em>United States v. Fike </em>(C.A.5, 1972), 449 F.2d 191, 193; <em>Phelper v. Decker </em>(C.A.5, 1968), 401 F.2d 232; <em>Cipres v. United States </em>(C.A.9, 1965), 343 F.2d 95.\u201d <em>Wilson </em>at 143-144, 75 O.O.2d 190, 346 N.E.2d 666.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">{\u00b6 38} In <em>Wilson, </em>this court held that the coercive nature of a potential criminal penalty negated any consent to search: \u201cIn the case before us, the coercion represented by the sole alternative of possible criminal prosecution clearly negates any \u2018consent\u2019 which may be inferred from the allowance of the inspection and, therefore, the validity of such searches upon the basis of consent is not sustainable.\u201d <em>Wilson </em>at 144, 75 O.O.2d 190, 346 N.E.2d 666.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">{\u00b6 39} This case is not about whether police officers could have legally executed a chemical test on Hoover. A search can meet the requirements of the Fourth Amendment even if it is executed without a suspect\u2019s consent. Officers could have sought a warrant to obtain a test. Further, the United States Supreme Court has held that when a defendant refuses to consent to a taking of his blood for chemical analysis, a blood sample taken over his objection and without his consent is admissible in evidence, even if no warrant had been obtained, if the officer had probable cause to arrest for DUI. <em>Schmerber v. California </em>(1966), 384 U.S. 757, 86 S.Ct. 1826, 16 L.Ed.2d 908. <em>Schmerber </em>thus protects the state\u2019s ability to gather evidence to prove its case without obtaining a defendant\u2019s consent. The defendant can still refuse to consent, but his failure to consent lacks strategic value because the state can find another way to acquire the necessary evidence. That is different from the majority\u2019s claim in this case that a defendant has no right to assert a refusal to consent. <em>Schmerber </em>exists <em>because </em>a defendant has the right to refuse consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">{\u00b6 40} The issue here is whether the state can criminalize a person\u2019s failure to consent to a warrantless search or, in other words, force a consent to search through the coercive power of threatened jail time. Although consent is implied by R.C. 4511.191, consent can be withdrawn. \u201cA suspect may * * * delimit as he chooses the scope of the search to which he consents.\u201d <em>Florida v. Jimeno </em>(1991), 500 U.S. 248. 252. 111 S.Ct. 1801. 114 L.Ed.2d 297.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AJp\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>Richard Cordray, Attorney General, and Benjamin C.

Perez, Chief Prosecutor for the city of Cleveland, supporting the position of the state for amicus curiae city of Cleveland.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">{\u00b6 41} Imposing criminal sanctions for failure to consent goes far beyond the state\u2019s power \u2014 recognized in <em>Gustafson, </em>76 Ohio St.3d 425, 668 N.E.2d 435, and other cases \u2014 to regulate the licensure of drivers. As in <em>Wilson, </em>the statute at issue herein imposes a codified dilemma \u2014 consent to a warrantless search or face the possibility of a criminal penalty \u2014 and thus amounts to coercion. R.C. 4511.19(A)(2) therefore violates defendants\u2019 rights under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Section 14, Article I of the Ohio Constitution. Because R.C. 4511.19(A)(2) criminalizes a suspect\u2019s failure to consent to a chemical test, I would find the statute unconstitutional.</p>\n<judges id=\"b542-5\">Moyer, C.J., and O\u2019Donnell, J., concur in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
