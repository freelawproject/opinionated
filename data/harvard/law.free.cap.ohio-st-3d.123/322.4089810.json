Brinkman Jr., David Hansen, and Gene Pierce, Ohio resident-electors and members of LetOhioVote.org, filed this original action seeking a writ of mandamus to compel the secretary of state to treat the video-lottery-terminal (\u201cVLT\u201d) provisions of 2009 Am.Sub.H.B. No. 1 (\u201cH.B. 1\u201d) as subject to referendum and to discharge her duties pursuant to Article II of the Ohio Constitution and R.C. Chapter 3519. The narrow focus of this case excludes policy considerations, which are the province of the legislative and executive branches, and is singularly centered on whether the citizens of Ohio have the right of referendum on the VLT provisions of H.B. 1, which authorize the Ohio Lottery Commission to locate as many as 2,500 VLTs at each of Ohio\u2019s seven horse-racing tracks for a potential of 17,500 machines in Ohio. The legal issue before us is whether these VLT provisions of H.B. 1 are an appropriation for the current expenses of the state government and are therefore not subject to referendum pursuant to Section Id, Article II of the Ohio Constitution. After careful review of this important question, we conclude that our jurisdiction has been properly invoked, that mandamus is an appropriate remedy, and that the VLT provisions of H.B. 1 are subject to referendum. Because relators have established entitlement to the requested extraordinary relief, we grant the writ and direct the secretary of state to treat the VLT provisions of H.B. 1 as subject to referendum.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">Facts and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b437-9\">{\u00b6 2} On July 13, 2009, Governor Strickland issued a directive to the Ohio Lottery entitled \u201cImplementing Video Lottery Terminals.\u201d In particular, the governor directed the Ohio Lottery Commission to immediately take steps to implement the placement of as many as 2,500 VLTs at each of seven horse-racing tracks in Ohio upon acknowledgement by the General Assembly of the commission\u2019s authority to do so. However, the governor expressly conditioned the implementation of the directive upon the passage of the VLT provisions by the General Assembly, explaining that if the provisions were not enacted \u201cinto law as part of or prior to the FY10-11 biennial budget law and such law is not signed into law by [the governor] within five days of the issuance of this Directive, the Directive shall then be deemed immediately null and void.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>H.B. 1</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">{\u00b6 3} On the same day that the governor issued his VLT directive, the General Assembly enacted H.B. 1, which includes the 2010-2011 biennial budget. H.B. 1 provides a line-item appropriation from the Lottery Profits Education Fund of over $2.2 billion to the Department of Education, which increases the appropriation to the Department of Education for Foundation Funding Fund from this fund for the current biennium by $851.5 million to reflect the expected revenues from the implementation of VLTs in May 2010 and the associated license fees. H.B. 1 also includes amendments to R.C. Chapter 3770 that authorize the State Lottery Commission to operate VLT games and promulgate rules relating to the commission\u2019s operation of VLT games, that specify that the provisions of R.C. Chapter 2915 criminalizing gambling activities are inapplicable, that bar political subdivisions from assessing new license or excise taxes on VLT licensees, and that purport to vest this court with exclusive, original jurisdiction over any claim that the provisions are unconstitutional.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>{\u00b6 4} In enacting H.B. 1, the General Assembly declared that the amendments relating to VLTs \u2014 R.C. 3770.03 and 3770.21 \u2014 are exempt from referendum because \u201c[they are] or relate[ ] to an appropriation for current expenses within the meaning of Ohio Constitution, Article II, Section Id and section 1.471 of the Revised Code, * * * and therefore take[] effect immediately when this act becomes law.\u201d Section 812.20 of H.B. 1. H.B. 1 additionally indicates that certain other amendments are subject to referendum and will not become immediately effective. Sections 812.10, 812.30, and 812.50 of H.B. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">{\u00b6 5} The governor signed H.B. 1 into law on July 17, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">Mandamus Case</p>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">{\u00b6 6} On July 20, 2009, relators filed this action seeking a writ of mandamus to compel respondent, Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner, to treat the VLT provisions of H.B. 1 as subject to referendum. We issued an accelerated briefing schedule and granted the motion of the directors of the Office of Budget and Management and the Ohio Lottery Commission to intervene as additional respondents (\u201cintervening respondents\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-9\">{\u00b6 7} On July 23, 2009, relators presented for filing with the secretary of state a referendum-petition summary, consisting of numerous part-petitions containing over 3,000 signatures, and a copy of one of the summary part-petitions for filing with the office of the attorney general. The office of the secretary of state deferred to the General Assembly\u2019s declaration that the VLT sections of H.B. 1 are not subject to referendum and declined to accept the filing of the referendum petitions \u201c[i]n the absence of a court order to the contrary.\u201d The office of the attorney general similarly rejected the filing presented to it, based on the conclusion that the VLT provisions were not subject to referendum.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-10\">{\u00b6 8} The rejection of the proffered filings precluded relators from circulating the referendum petition for signatures. Relators sought, and we granted, leave <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>to file an amended complaint that included the events that took place after the original complaint was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">{\u00b6 9} In briefs and arguments before this court, relators contend that the VLT provisions are subject to referendum because they are not appropriations for current state expenses, they neither make expenditures nor incur obligations, and they are not temporary measures necessary to effectuate an appropriation; instead, relators argue, the VLT provisions constitute a change in the permanent law of this state that generates, rather than spends, money, and they seek a 90-day stay of the VLT provisions so that they may have a meaningful opportunity to circulate a referendum petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">{\u00b6 10} The secretary of state urges that she does not have a clear legal duty to disregard the General Assembly\u2019s declaration in the bill that the VLT provisions are not subject to referendum or to adjudicate the question of whether the VLT provisions constitute an appropriation for current state expenses exempt from referendum. Instead, she maintains that she has a duty to reject referendum petitions that do not comply with express provisions of law and suggests that relators have an adequate remedy at law by way of an action for a declaratory judgment and an injunction in the common pleas court. She also contends that relators are merely seeking a declaratory judgment and an injunction, which this court lacks jurisdiction to issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">{\u00b6 11} Intervening respondents contend that the VLT provisions are not subject to referendum, because they appropriate money for education. However, to the extent that the VLT provisions themselves are not direct appropriations, the intervening respondents argue that the referendum process does not apply to laws providing for appropriations for current state expenses or to laws that are \u201cinextricably tied\u201d to a line-item appropriation for the current expenses of the state government or state institutions. Thus, intervening respondents claim that the VLT provisions provide for, or are inextricably tied to, the line-item appropriation for education in H.B. 1 because the VLT provisions generate the revenue that funds the appropriation. Further, without the VLT provisions, the appropriation cannot become immediately effective as required by Section Id, Article II, of the Ohio Constitution. Lastly, the intervening respondents contend that granting a writ of mandamus would be a vain act because the Lottery Commission already possesses the authority to implement VLT gaming without the amendments enacted by H.B. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">{\u00b6 12} Accordingly, we are called on to address whether relators are entitled to a writ of mandamus to compel the secretary of state to treat the VLT provisions of H.B. 1 as subject to referendum.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>Mandamus</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\">{\u00b6 13} To be entitled to a writ of mandamus, \u201crelators must establish a clear legal right to the requested relief, a corresponding clear legal duty on the part of the secretary of state to provide it, and the lack of an adequate remedy in the ordinary course of the law.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Heffelfinger v. Brunner, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 172, 2007-Ohio-5838, 876 N.E.2d 1231, \u00b6 13. Mandamus is available to challenge the failure to certify a referendum-petition summary. Cf. <em>State ex rel. Barren v. Brown </em>(1977), 51 Ohio St.2d 169, 171, 5 O.O.3d 136, 365 N.E.2d 887 (writ of mandamus granted to compel attorney general to certify that the referendum-petition summary is a fair and truthful statement of the measure to be referred).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">{\u00b6 14} Relators seek a writ of mandamus to compel the secretary of state to treat the VLT sections of H.B. 1 \u2014 R.C. 3770.03 and 3770.21 \u2014 as subject to the constitutional right of referendum and to fulfill each of her duties and obligations relating to the referendum under Article II of the Ohio Constitution and R.C. Chapter 3519. We conclude that relators\u2019 complaint for a writ of mandamus properly invokes our original jurisdiction and that an action in the court of common pleas for a declaratory judgment or a prohibitory injunction would not provide an adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cIn general, if declaratory judgment would not be a complete remedy unless coupled with extraordinary ancillary relief in the nature of a mandatory injunction, the availability of declaratory judgment does not preclude a writ of mandamus.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Mill Creek Metro. Park Dist. Bd. of Commrs. v. Tablack </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 293, 297, 714 N.E.2d 917. In this case, a declaratory judgment would not be an adequate remedy without a mandatory injunction ordering the secretary of state to treat the VLT sections of H.B. 1 as subject to referendum. See <em>State ex rel. Ohio Gen. Assembly v. Brunner, </em>114 Ohio St.3d 386, 2007-Ohio-3780, 872 N.E.2d 912, \u00b6 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">{\u00b6 16} Nor would a prohibitory injunction provide relators with the relief they request here: an order to compel the secretary of state to comply with her duties under Section 1c, Article II of the Ohio Constitution and R.C. 3519.01 to treat the VLT provisions as being subject to referendum. Moreover, given the state\u2019s desire to immediately implement these provisions and relators\u2019 wish to immediately begin the referendum process, a common pleas court action would not be sufficiently speedy to determine whether the VLT provisions of H.B. 1 are subject to referendum. See <em>State ex rel. Beane v. Dayton, </em>112 Ohio St.3d 553, 2007-Ohio-811, 862 N.E.2d 97, \u00b6 31 (\u201cThe alternate remedy must be complete, beneficial, and speedy in order to be an adequate remedy at law\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">{\u00b6 17} Therefore, relators lack an adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law to raise their claim, and mandamus is an appropriate remedy to resolve it.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>The Right of Referendum</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cThe constitutional right of citizens to referendum is of paramount importance.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Ohio Gen. Assembly v. Brunner, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 103, 2007-Ohio-4460, 873 N.E.2d 1232, \u00b6 8. \u201cThe referendum * * * is a means for direct political participation, allowing the people the final decision, amounting to a veto power, over enactments of representative bodies. The practice is designed to \u2018give citizens a voice on questions of public policy.\u2019 \u201d <em>Eastlake v. Forest City Ents., Inc. </em>(1976), 426 U.S. 668, 673, 96 S.Ct. 2358, 49 L.Ed.2d 132, quoting <em>James v. Valtierra </em>(1971), 402 U.S. 137, 141, 91 S.Ct. 1331, 28 L.Ed.2d 678.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">{\u00b6 19} In 1912, the electors of Ohio adopted the initiative and referendum amendment to the constitution. Shortly thereafter, we explained the significance of the amendment:</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">{\u00b6 20} \u201cNow, the people\u2019s right to the use of the initiative and referendum is one of the most essential safeguards to representative government. * * * The potential virtue of the T. &amp; R.\u2019 does not reside in the good statutes and good constitutional amendments initiated, nor in the bad statutes and bad proposed constitutional amendments that are killed. Rather, the greatest efficiency of the T. and R.\u2019 rests in the wholesome restraint imposed automatically upon the general assembly and the governor and the possibilities of that latent power when called into action by the voters.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Nolan v. ClenDening </em>(1915), 93 Ohio St. 264, 277-278, 112 N.E. 1029.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">{\u00b6 21} \u201cThis reserved power of referendum applies to every law passed in this state and provides an important check on actions taken by the government.\u201d <em>Ohio Gen. Assembly, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 103, 2007-Ohio-4460, 873 N.E.2d 1232, \u00b6 9. Thus, \u201c[l]aws generally do not take effect until 90 days have passed from the date they are filed by the governor with the secretary of state, to allow for a possible referendum. Section 1c, Article II, Ohio Constitution.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-9\">Exceptions to the Right of Referendum</p>\n<p id=\"b442-10\">{\u00b6 22} Section Id, Article II of the Ohio Constitution sets forth exceptions to the general rule that all laws and sections of laws are subject to referendum and thus do not become immediately effective:</p>\n<p id=\"b442-11\">{\u00b6 23} \u201cLaws providing for tax levies, appropriations for the current expenses of the state government and state institutions, and emergency laws necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health or safety, shall go into immediate effect. * * * The laws mentioned in this section shall not be subject to referendum.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b442-12\">{\u00b6 24} In construing these exceptions, \u201cwe must \u2018read words and phrases in context according to the rules of grammar and common usage.\u2019 \u201d <em>State ex rel. Colvin v. Brunner, </em>120 Ohio St.3d 110, 2008-Ohio-5041, 896 N.E.2d 979, \u00b6 43, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>quoting <em>State ex rel. Lee v. Karnes, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 559, 2004-Ohio-5718, 817 N.E.2d 76, \u00b6 23. We liberally construe the powers of initiative and referendum to effectuate the rights reserved. <em>State ex rel. Evans v. Blackwell, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 1, 2006-Ohio-4334, 854 N.E.2d 1025, \u00b6 32. Further, \u201c[i]n view of the great precaution taken by the constitutional convention of 1912 to set forth and safeguard, with the particularity of detail usually found only in legislative acts, the right of referendum, and the three exceptions thereto, our court should not deny the people that right, <em>unless the act in question is plainly and persuasively included within one of the three classes excepted from the operation of the referendum.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>State ex rel. Keller v. Forney </em>(1923), 108 Ohio St. 463, 467-468, 141 N.E. 16. These exceptions to the general rule of referendum must be strictly, but reasonably, construed. Id. at paragraphs one and two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">The Language of the Exceptions</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">{\u00b6 25} The intervening respondents contend that the court should read the exception for appropriations to include \u201claws providing for\u201d appropriations. We reject this contention. The language used in Section Id, Article II of the Ohio Constitution demonstrates that the phrase \u201cLaws providing for\u201d modifies only \u201ctax levies.\u201d Otherwise, Section Id would also provide an exception for \u201cLaws providing for * * * emergency laws.\u201d Further, to the extent that there are two reasonable interpretations of Section Id, our caselaw requires that we narrowly construe the exceptions to the right of referendum.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">{\u00b6 26} The plain language of Section Id, Article II of the Ohio Constitution creates three categories of exceptions from referendum: (1) laws providing for tax levies, (2) appropriations for current expenses of the state government and state institutions, and (3) emergency laws necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, or safety. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b443-8\">{\u00b6 27} Intervening respondents also contend either that the VLT provisions themselves are an appropriation or that when read in pari materia with the constitutional requirement that any funds raised by the state lottery can be used only to support education, this legislation is an appropriation. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-9\">{\u00b6 28} An appropriation is \u201can authorization granted by the general assembly to make expenditures and to incur obligations for specific purposes.\u201d R.C. 131.01(F). Similarly, in <em>State ex rel. Akron Edn. Assn. v. Essex </em>(1976), 47 Ohio St.2d 47, 49, 1 O.O.3d 28, 351 N.E.2d 118, we explained that the ordinary and common meaning of the phrase \u201cappropriation bill\u201d is a \u201cmeasure before a legislative body which authorizes \u2018the expenditure of public moneys and stipulating the amount, manner, and purpose of the various items of expenditure.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 49, 1 O.O.3d 28, 351 N.E.2d 118, quoting Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary (2d Ed.). See also Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (9th Ed.2009) 117-118 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>(defining \u201cappropriation\u201d to mean \u201c[a] legislative body\u2019s act of setting aside a sum of money for a public purpose\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">{\u00b6 29} The VLT provisions of H.B. 1 are not themselves appropriations for state expenses because they do not set aside a sum of money for a public purpose; neither R.C. 3770.03 nor 3770.21 as amended by H.B. 1 makes expenditures or incurs obligations. Rather, they authorize the State Lottery Commission to operate VLT games and to promulgate rules relating to the commission\u2019s operation of VLT games, specify that the provisions of R.C. Chapter 2915 criminalizing gambling activities are inapplicable, bar political subdivisions from assessing new license or excise taxes on VLT licensees, and purport to vest this court with exclusive, original jurisdiction over any claim that the provisions are unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">{\u00b6 30} We reject intervening respondent\u2019s position that because the funds generated by the VLTs must be used for education, the VLT provisions of H.B. 1 constitute an appropriation. Section 6, Article XV mandates that any funds raised by the state lottery be used to support education \u201cas determined in appropriations made by the General Assembly.\u201d The VLT provisions of H.B. 1 do not appropriate anything. A separate provision of H.B. 1 \u2014 line-item 200612 - appropriates these funds to education. Thus, notwithstanding the constitutional mandate that all lottery funds be spent on education, the existence of a separate line item for appropriation of the revenues generated by VLTs demonstrates that the VLT provisions themselves are not appropriations.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">Inextricably Tied or Related to Appropriations</p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">{\u00b6 31} The intervening respondents next claim that even if the challenged VLT provisions do not specifically set aside a sum of money for a specific public purpose, they are within the appropriations exception because they are \u201cinextricably tied\u201d to the $2.3 billion in appropriations from the Lottery Profits Education Fund for education provided by H.B. 1. Relators counter that the VLT sections are not within the Section Id, Article II exception, because they raise revenue rather than spend it.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-9\">\n<em>Section 812.20</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b444-10\">{\u00b6 32} The General Assembly specified in Section 812.20 of H.B. 1 that the amendment concerning VLTs in R.C. 3770.03 and 3770.21 is excluded from referendum because \u201cit is <em>or relates to </em>an appropriation for current expenses within the meaning of Ohio Constitution, Article II, Section Id and section 1.471 of the Revised Code.\u201d (Emphasis added.) This language, like the intervening respondents\u2019 advocated construction of the exception, is broader than the applicable constitutional language, which states that \u201cappropriations for the current expenses of the state government and state institutions * * * shall go into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>immediate effect * * * [and] shall not be subject to referendum.\u201d Section Id, Article II. The constitutional language does not expressly include an exception for laws that <em>relate to </em>appropriations for the current expenses of the state government.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">{\u00b6 33} Moreover, this court has previously held that the analogous exception of Section Id, Article II for \u201claws providing for tax levies\u201d is \u201climited to an actual self-executing levy of taxes, and is not synonymous with laws \u2018relating\u2019 to tax levies, or \u2018pertaining\u2019 to tax levies, or \u2018concerning\u2019 tax levies.\u201d <em>Keller, </em>108 Ohio St. 463, 141 N.E. 16, at paragraph three of the syllabus; see also <em>State ex rel. Taft v. Franklin Cty. Court of Common Pleas </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 480, 483, 692 N.E.2d 560 (holding that an act that authorizes the electorate to determine whether taxes should be levied does not levy taxes and consequently that Section Id, Article II does not apply).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">{\u00b6 34} Therefore, notwithstanding the General Assembly\u2019s language in Section 812.20 of the act, the VLT sections of H.B. 1 are not excepted from referendum if they merely relate to an appropriation for current state-government expenses; the exception is for appropriations for the current expenses of the state government \u2014 not for enactment of laws (other than tax levies) designed to generate revenue that can be appropriated.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-8\">{\u00b6 35} There is no authority in our precedent that would permit the referendum exception to apply to provisions that, once implemented, raise revenue to provide funds for an appropriation in another part of the act, even if \u2014 as the intervening respondents claim \u2014 they are \u201cinextricably tied\u201d or related to each other.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-9\"><em>Kelly </em>and <em>Cty. Rd. Assn.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b445-10\">{\u00b6 36} Intervening respondents\u2019 reliance on <em>Kelly v. Marylanders for Sports Sanity, Inc. </em>(1987), 310 Md. 437, 530 A.2d 245, and <em>Cty. Rd. Assn. of Michigan v. Bd. of State Canvassers </em>(1979), 407 Mich. 101, 282 N.W.2d 774, is unpersuasive and misplaced. Both cases involved legislation linked to an appropriation that the courts determined was not subject to referendum.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-11\">{\u00b6 37} In <em>Kelly, </em>the Court of Appeals of Maryland held that statutes authorizing the state stadium authority to borrow funds through the issuance of bonds and designating a site for the construction of professional baseball and football stadiums constituted appropriations that were not subject to referendum because those statutes were part of an interdependent and legally inseparable package of legislation that appropriated funds. 310 Md. at 474, 530 A.2d 245. Similarly, in <em>Cty. Rd. Assn., </em>the Supreme Court of Michigan concluded that statutes increasing various taxes on fuel and vehicle registrations constituted part of the appropriation to the highway department and were not subject to referendum.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>{\u00b6 38} <em>Kelly </em>and <em>Cty. Rd. Assn. </em>are distinguishable from the case before us because the state constitutions in those jurisdictions do not contain an exception from referendum for legislation that raises revenue by imposing a tax levy. See Section 2, Article 16, Maryland Constitution; Section 9, Article 2, Michigan Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">{\u00b6 39} In contrast, the Ohio Constitution specifically exempts laws providing for tax levies from referendum. Section Id, Article II, Ohio Constitution. The electorate could have expressly excepted other means of raising revenue from referendum, but it did not. As we have consistently held, \u201c \u2018[t]he canon expressio unius est exclusio alterius tells us that the express inclusion of one thing implies the exclusion of the other.\u2019 \u201d <em>Crawford-Cole v.

In fact, if we were to read the appropriations exception to referendum as broadly as the intervening respondents advocate, the exception for tax levies would be meaningless because all means of raising revenue for government appropriations could be considered inextricably tied to appropriations.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">{\u00b6 40} Our view is supported by the caselaw of other jurisdictions concluding that measures raising the revenue to be appropriated are not appropriations. See <em>Nicholson v. Cooney </em>(1994), 265 Mont. 406, 415-416, 877 P.2d 486 (rejecting the argument that a revenue-raising measure that was \u201cinextricably tied\u201d to appropriations legislation and that was used to balance the state budget fell within the appropriations exception to referendum); <em>Lawrence v. Beermann </em>(1974), 192 Neb. 507, 508-509, 222 N.W.2d 809 (explaining that the appropriations exception to referendum \u201cshould be and must be construed to mean the ordinary running expenses of the state government and existing state institutions, and not to include money or appropriations or funds created or acts which have as then-design a new or different scheme for * * * revenue raising and financing\u201d); <em>Brooks v. Zabka </em>(1969), 168 Colo. 265, 270-271, 450 P.2d 653 (\u201cThe sales tax ordinance involved here is designed to raise revenue, not to provide for expenditures from public funds. * * * A sales tax ordinance is the exact antithesis of an appropriation\u201d excepted from referendum); <em>Heinkel v. Toberman </em>(1950), 360 Mo. 58, 69, 226 S.W.2d 1012 (declining to construe a fuel tax as an appropriation, notwithstanding a separate constitutional provision requiring the funds generated by such taxes to be appropriated by the legislature for certain projects related to the state highway system).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\"><em>Taft </em>and <em>Davies Mfg.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">{\u00b6 41} The intervening respondents rely on <em>State ex rel. Taft v. Franklin Cty. Court of Common Pleas </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 480, 692 N.E.2d 560, and <em>State ex rel. Davies Mfg. Co. v. Donahey </em>(1916), 94 Ohio St. 382, 114 N.E. 1037, in support <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>of their argument that provisions of law that are inextricably tied to appropriations are exempt from referendum. This reliance, however, is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">{\u00b6 42} In <em>Taft, </em>we held that certain provisions of legislation imposing taxes to fund public schools were not subject to referendum although they did not appropriate money because implementation of those sections \u2014 calling for a statewide election on a proposed increase in the state sales and use tax\u2014 depended upon the appropriation of money for the election in a separate section of the same act. 81 Ohio St.3d at 484, 692 N.E.2d 560.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">{\u00b6 43} Unlike the provisions at issue in <em>Taft, </em>the VLT provisions are not dependent upon any appropriation in H.B. 1. If anything, as the intervening respondents concede, the dependency is reversed: the appropriation of over $2.2 billion to the Department of Education from the Lottery Profits Education Fund is dependent, in part, upon the projected revenues from the enactment of the VLT provisions. The VLT provisions are also not dependent upon the provision in Section 305.10 of H.B. 1 authorizing the office of the inspector general to use $50,000 of its operating expenses in each fiscal year to defray any expenses associated with reviewing the VLT operations. Section 305.10 does not implement the VLT sections, and the inspector general need not use any money to review VLT operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">{\u00b6 44} Intervening respondents\u2019 reliance on <em>Davies Mfg., </em>94 Ohio St. 382, 114 N.E. 1037, is also misplaced. There, we held that a competitive-bidding requirement was not subject to referendum, because it was only a condition for an appropriation for the current expenses of the state government; it never became part of the permanent law.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">{\u00b6 45} In <em>State ex rel. Ohio AFL-CIO v. Voinovich </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 225, 631 N.E.2d 582, we explained that \u201c \u2018[a]ny section of a law which changes the permanent law of the state is subject to referendum under the powers reserved to the people by Section 1 of Article II [of the Ohio Constitution], even though the law also contains a section providing for an appropriation for the current expenses of the state government and state institutions which under Section Id, Article II, becomes immediately effective.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 236, 631 N.E.2d 582, quoting <em>State ex rel. Riffe v. Brown </em>(1977), 51 Ohio St.2d 149, 167, 5 O.O.3d 125, 365 N.E.2d 876 (O\u2019Neill, C.J., dissenting). As Chief Justice O\u2019Neill observed in distinguishing <em>Davies Mfg. </em>in <em>Riffe, </em>which was overruled in <em>Ohio AFL-CIO, </em>69 Ohio St.3d at 236, 631 N.E.2d 582, \u201c[t]o give practical effect to the constitutional exception for appropriations, temporary provisions needed to implement the appropriation must also be effective immediately. But a change in the permanent law governing the people of Ohio, which incidentally may require an appropriation, is a wholly different matter.\u201d <em>Riffe, </em>51 Ohio St.2d at 165, 365 N.E.2d 876.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>{\u00b6 46} The challenged VLT provisions are not <em>temporary measures </em>that are conditions upon the appropriations made from the lottery profits education fund. The VLT sections of H.B. 1 <em>change </em>the permanent law of this state by, inter alia, defining VLTs, requiring the State Lottery Commission to promulgate rules establishing the licensees\u2019 minimum investments in buildings and grounds at the facilities where the VLTs will be located, barring new license or excise taxes on licensees after the effective date of the provisions, and purporting to vest exclusive, original jurisdiction in this court over any claims asserting that the VLT sections or any actions taken by the governor or State Lottery Commission pursuant to these sections are unconstitutional. Further, the amendment to R.C. 3770.03 permanently changes the law of Ohio by authorizing the Ohio Lottery Commission to operate VLT games, defined in proposed R.C. 3770.21(A) to mean \u201cany electronic device approved by the state lottery commission that provides immediate prize determinations for participants on an electronic display.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">{\u00b6 47} The changes to the permanent law of the state distinguish the instant case from <em>Taft </em>and <em>Davies Mfg., </em>in which temporary measures were enacted to effectuate an appropriation. The VLT provisions at issue here constitute permanent changes that will be effective well after the biennium ends and are thus subject to referendum.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">{\u00b6 48} A different section of the Ohio Constitution also supports our conclusion that the VLT provisions of H.B. 1 are not an appropriation. Section 22, Article II of the Ohio Constitution provides that \u201cno appropriation shall be made for a longer period than two years.\u201d In contrast to this temporal limitation, the VLT provisions of H.B. 1 \u2014 R.C. 3770.03 and 3770.21 \u2014 do not expire in two years and are designed to become a permanent part of state law for purposes of generating state income. As such, these provisions are not appropriations.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">{\u00b6 49} The plain language of Section Id, Article II of the Ohio Constitution provides three limited exceptions to referendum: laws providing for tax levies, appropriations for the current expenses of the state government, and emergency laws necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, or safety, none of which expressly excepts changes to the permanent law of this state that provide a mechanism to raise revenue to provide funds for an appropriation. Courts are not authorized to add exceptions that are not contained in the express language of these constitutional provisions. Cf., e.g., <em>State ex rel. Stoll v. Logan Cty. Bd. of Elections, </em>117 Ohio St.3d 76, 2008-Ohio-333, 881 N.E.2d 1214, \u00b6 39 (\u201cthe statute contains no exception, and we cannot add one to its express language\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-8\">{\u00b6 50} The intervening respondents\u2019 interpretation of the appropriations exception would mean that even if the electorate repealed the tax-levy exception, laws providing for tax levies would remain excluded from referendum because they are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>\u201cinextricably tied\u201d or \u201crelated\u201d to appropriations. In addition, under this interpretation of Section Id, Article II of the Ohio Constitution, the General Assembly could presumably enact laws to raise revenue for appropriations by legalizing drugs or prostitution and thereby prevent the electorate from seeking referendum on the manner it chose to generate revenue to be used for an appropriation. This is not the meaning of Section Id, Article II of the Ohio Constitution. See <em>State ex rel. Colvin v. Brunner, </em>120 Ohio St.3d 110, 2008-Ohio-5041, 896 N.E.2d 979, \u00b6 58 (courts have duty to construe constitutional provisions to avoid unreasonable or absurd results). Our duty is to construe the meaning of the plain language of the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">{\u00b6 51} Finally, we decline the invitation of the intervening respondents to address whether the State Lottery Commission is authorized to implement VLTs regardless of whether the challenged provisions of H.B. 1 are effective, because the parties have not submitted complete evidence and argument on this issue. We confine our opinion here to only the narrower issue raised in this case regarding the rights of citizens to a referendum on the VLT provisions of H.B. 1. Furthermore, declining to address a legal issue not squarely before us is consistent with our reluctance to issue advisory opinions, the principle of judicial restraint, and our duty to liberally construe election laws in favor of the right to vote. <em>State ex rel. Myles v. Brunner, </em>120 Ohio St.3d 328, 2008-Ohio-5097, 899 N.E.2d 120, \u00b6 26, fn. 2, quoting <em>State ex rel. Barletta v. Fersch, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 295, 2003-Ohio-3629, 791 N.E.2d 452, \u00b6 22 (\u201c \u2018we will not issue advisory opinions, and this rule applies equally to election cases\u2019 \u201d); <em>PDK Laboratories, Inc. v. United States Drug Enforcement Admin. </em>(C.A.D.C.2004), 362 F.3d 786, 799 (Roberts, J., concurring in part and in judgment) (recognizing the \u201ccardinal principle of judicial restraint \u2014 if it is not necessary to decide more, it is necessary not to decide more\u201d); <em>Colvin, </em>120 Ohio St.3d 110, 2008-Ohio-5041, 896 N.E.2d 979, \u00b6 62 (noting the court\u2019s \u201cduty to liberally construe election laws in favor of the right to vote\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">{\u00b6 52} Accordingly, relators, LetOhioVote.org, Brinkman, Hansen, and Pierce, have established entitlement to the requested extraordinary relief in mandamus, and the secretary of state is directed to accept the submission of relators\u2019 referendum-petition summary and to discharge the duties of her office as provided by Article II of the Ohio Constitution and R.C. 3519.01.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">{\u00b6 53} The video-lottery-terminal provisions of 2009 Am.Sub.H.B. No. 1 do not fall within any of the exceptions to the right of referendum in that they are neither laws providing for tax levies, nor appropriations for the current expenses of the state government, nor emergency laws necessary for the immediate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>preservation of the public peace, health, or safety. Therefore, they are subject to referendum.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">{\u00b6 54} In conformity with our decision in <em>Ohio AFL-CIO, </em>69 Ohio St.3d at 236-237, 631 N.E.2d 582, and as acknowledged by the respondents at oral argument, relators are entitled to an extension of the 90-day period in which to submit a referendum petition on the VLT provisions to the secretary of state. We therefore stay the amendments to R.C. 3770.03 and the enactment of R.C. 3770.21, which are the VLT provisions of H.B. 1, for 90 days from the date of this decision in order to allow relators a meaningful opportunity to circulate a referendum petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">{\u00b6 55} Ours is still a representative democracy in which legislators derive their authority from the citizens of our state, who enjoy a constitutional right of referendum. While the Ohio Constitution expressly provides that appropriations for the current expenses of the state government are not subject to referendum, permanent changes to state law relating to such appropriations <em>are </em>subject to referendum. We are not unmindful of the effect our decision may have on the state budget, nor of the commendable efforts of the members of the executive and legislative branches of state government to fulfill their constitutional duties to balance the budget in Ohio; however, our own constitutional duty is to ensure compliance with the requirements of the Ohio Constitution irrespective of their effect on the state\u2019s current financial conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">Writ granted.</p>\n<judges id=\"b450-7\">Moyer, C.J., and Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, Lanzinger, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b450-8\">Pfeifer, J., dissents.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b438-6\">. {\u00b6 a} More specifically, the amendments to R.C. 3770.03 and the newly enacted R.C. 3770.21 in H.B. 1 are as follows, with the language enacted by H.B. 1 in italics:</p>\n<p id=\"AdN\">{\u00b6 b} \u201cSee. 3770.03.(A) The state lottery commission shall promulgate rules under which a statewide lottery may be conducted, <em>which includes, and since the original enactment of this section has included, the authority for the commission to operate video lottery terminal games.

Here, for the first time, this court is analyzing the state\u2019s biennial budget bill for the purpose of determining citizens\u2019 right to seek referendum. Although this court has previously interpreted Sections lc and Id, Article II of the Ohio Constitution in <em>State ex rel. Riffe v. Brown </em>(1977), 51 Ohio St.2d 149, 5 O.O.3d 125, 365 N.E.2d 876; <em>State ex rel. Ohio AFL-CIO v. Voinovieh </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 225, 631 N.E.2d 582; and <em>State ex rel. Taft v. Franklin Cty. Court of Common Pleas </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 480, 692 N.E.2d 560, this case is different in that we are asked to interpret those sections in the context of the 2010-2011 budget bill. This difference alters the prism through which we must view the legislation in relation to referendum.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>{\u00b6 58} The people\u2019s power of referendum set forth in Section 1c, Article II of the Ohio Constitution is limited by the General Assembly\u2019s power to raise and disburse funds pursuant to Section Id, Article II. Section 1c, Article II of the Ohio Constitution provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">{\u00b6 59} \u201cThe second aforestated power reserved by the people is designated the referendum, and the signatures of six per centum of the electors shall be required upon a petition to order the submission to the electors of the state for their approval or rejection, of any law, section of any law or any item in any law appropriating money passed by the general assembly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">{\u00b6 60} Section 1c, Article II does indeed allow referendum on appropriations, namely, \u201cany item in any law appropriating money passed by the general assembly.\u201d But Section Id, Article II limits referendum\u2019s reach:</p>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">{\u00b6 61} \u201cLaws providing for tax levies, appropriations for the current expenses of the state government and state institutions, and emergency laws necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health or safety, shall go into immediate effect. * * * The laws mentioned in this section shall not be subject to the referendum.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b451-9\">{\u00b6 62} Appropriations for \u201cthe current expenses of the state government and state institutions\u201d are the type of appropriations shielded from referendum. The exceptions in Section Id, Article II allow the legislature to budget without the uncertainty that referendum brings to the legislative process. Free from the threat of referendum, obligations and the means to fulfill those obligations are preserved with predictability. The exemption from referendum allows the state to make good on its liabilities; without it, the budget could remain in limbo for over a year, leaving the state unable to pay its \u201ccurrent expenses.\u201d With the shield from referendum, the business of the state moves forward, leaving budget-related legislation in place.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-10\">{\u00b6 63} The legislation contained in Am.Sub.H.B. No. 1 (\u201cH.B. 1\u201d) related to video lottery terminals (\u201cVLTs\u201d) is no mere legislative add-on, snuck into a mammoth bill. Instead, the VLT legislation is at the very heart of the budget bill, at the very heart of how Ohio is going to pay for its spending over the next two years. Without VLT-enabling legislation, the budget crumbles. Pursuant to H.B. 1, a $2,267 billion appropriation for schools is dependent upon the implementation of VLTs in Ohio. Without the income expected from VLTs, a large part of the funding for that appropriation vanishes, leaving an $851.5 million hole in the budget.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-11\">{\u00b6 64} The money to be raised by VLTs is directly and inextricably linked to a specific appropriation. R.C. 3770.06(B) requires net profits from all lottery functions \u2014 including proceeds from VLTs- \u2014 to be deposited into the Lottery Profits Education Fund. For fiscal years 2010 and 2011, the budget bill requires <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>that approximately $2,267 billion flow directly from the Lottery Profits Education Fund to local school districts according to the Foundation Funding formula. Line 200612 of the budget bill instructs that some $2,267 billion from the Lottery Profits Education Fund \u2014 more than $990 million in fiscal year 2010, and nearly $1.3 billion in fiscal year 2011 \u2014 will go to local schools in the biennium. See H.B. 1 at 2797. At regular intervals throughout the budget period, monies are issued from the Lottery Profits Education Fund to the treasurer for disbursement to school districts throughout the state. There is no commingling of funds \u2014 every cent of the estimated $851.5 million VLT revenue will go into the Lottery Profits Education Fund, and every cent of that fund will go to Ohio schools.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">{\u00b6 65} With VLT-enabling legislation at risk of referendum, the General Assembly cannot make the appropriation from the Lottery Profits Education Fund that it had budgeted. To decimate the fund is to kill the appropriation that comes from that fund. There is no spending without a source of funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">{\u00b6 66} The highest courts of Michigan and Maryland have held that a law that raises revenue and then appropriates it for a specific purpose is sheltered from the referendum power. <em>Cty. Rd. Assn. of Michigan v. Bd. of State Canvassers </em>(1979), 407 Mich. 101, 282 N.W.2d 774; <em>Kelly v. Marylanders for Sports Sanity, Inc. </em>(1987), 310 Md. 437, 530 A.2d 245. The Michigan Constitution exempts \u201cacts making appropriations for state institutions\u201d from the right of referendum. Section 9, Article 2. In <em>Cty. Rd. Assn., </em>citizens sought referendum on legislation that increased taxes on motor vehicle fuel and vehicle weight. A separate bill established allocations for transportation projects. The Michigan Supreme Court held that the statutes establishing the taxes should be read in pari materia with appropriation statutes:</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">{\u00b6 67} \u201c \u2018Statutes In pari materia are those which relate to the same person or thing, or the same class of persons or things, or which have a common purpose. It is the rule that in construction of a particular statute, or in the interpretation of its provisions, all statutes relating to the same subject, or having the same general purpose, should be read in connection with it, as together constituting one law, although enacted at different times, and containing no reference one to the other.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cty. Rd. Assn., </em>407 Mich, at 119, 282 N.W.2d 774, quoting <em>Detroit v. Michigan Bell Telephone Co. </em>(1965), 374 Mich. 543, 558, 132 N.W.2d 660.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">{\u00b6 68} The court held that the taxes and the expenditures for roadways \u201cmust be viewed as a comprehensive, single legislative program.\u201d <em>Cty. Rd. Assn., </em>407 Mich, at 118, 282 N.W.2d 774. The court pointed to the statements of the governor and to legislative history to establish the inextricable linkage between the taxing and appropriations statutes: \u201cBoth the Governor\u2019s stated approach and what legislative history is available suggest * * * \u2018a comprehensive system for the collecting of specific taxes on motor vehicles and motor vehicle fuels, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>allocation of funds therefrom and the use thereof for (transportation) purposes.\u2019 \u201d (Footnote deleted.) Id., quoting <em>Michigan Good Rds. Fedn. v. Alger </em>(1952), 333 Mich. 352, 360-361, 53 N.W.2d 481.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">{\u00b6 69} Likewise, the highest court in Maryland has held that a \u201crevenue raising and spending measure\u201d is \u201cembraced within the exclusionary provisions contained in the Referendum Amendment.\u201d <em>Kelly v. Marylanders for Sports Sanity, Inc., </em>310 Md. at 461, 530 A.2d 245. The Maryland Constitution exempts from the referendum power \u201cappropriation[s] for maintaining the State Government.\u201d Section 2, Article XVI. The legislation involved in <em>Kelly </em>was a comprehensive scheme to raise funds to acquire land and construct sports facilities at Camden Yards for the Baltimore Orioles and a possible NFL team, including provisions authorizing the Stadium Authority to issue bonds to raise revenue for the project and a requirement that the State Lottery Agency conduct each year between two and four sports lotteries for the benefit of the Stadium Authority. <em>Kelly, </em>310 Md. at 439-444, 530 A.2d 245. The court held that an untenable result would follow if the court attempted to detach the various provisions from one another. \u201cConsidered apart, the stadium bills would not be workable to achieve the objective of the appropriation,\u201d and to sever the provisions \u201cwould scuttle the entire project by fatally undermining its dominant purpose \u2014 to finance the acquisition of a site upon which to construct sports stadiums.\u201d <em>Kelly, </em>310 Md. at 474, 530 A.2d 245. Accordingly, the court concluded, the legislature intended for the provisions to \u201cfunction in tandem as a unitary solution to its singular objective \u2014 an objective which it timed for immediate implementation.\u201d <em>Kelly, </em>310 Md. at 473, 530 A.2d 245.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">{\u00b6 70} These state supreme courts have correctly understood that the appropriations exception to the referendum power \u201chas as its <em>constitutional </em>purpose protecting from referendum the purpose or object of the <em>legislative </em>appropriation.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) <em>Kelly, </em>310 Md. at 472, 530 A.2d 245. It is the job of courts to determine whether the \u201cdominant statutory objective\u201d of the appropriation can be implemented without the supporting legislation. Id. The dominant statutory objective of the appropriation at issue in this case is the funding of the Lottery Education Fund and the concomitant funding of Ohio schools. Without the supporting VLT-enabling legislation, the objective of the appropriation cannot be implemented.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">{\u00b6 71} The shield for appropriations from referendum is useless if the funding source of the appropriation is not also shielded from referendum. Otherwise, a tiny minority (in Ohio, six percent of the voting electorate, Section lc) can suspend the operation of an otherwise valid appropriation by targeting its funding source for a referendum challenge. The resulting hole in the budget throws the entire finances of the state into disarray, affecting other appropriations.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"ACl\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>Langdon Law, L.L.C., David R.

It is not about whether the governor and the General Assembly acted prudently in dismissing the people\u2019s will \u2014 demonstrated time and again at the ballot box \u2014 to keep slot machines out of Ohio. The budget crafted by the governor and enacted by the General Assembly cannot be overturned by referendum.
