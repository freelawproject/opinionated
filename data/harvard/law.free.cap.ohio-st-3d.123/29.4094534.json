Because the board abused its discretion in acting on the administrative appeal relating to the service-credit claim without the proper vote to do so, we grant the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>Dental Services Provided by Dr. Ehrbar to DRC</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">{\u00b6 2} Respondent Dr. Diane Ehrbar is a dentist who performed services for relator Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction (\u201cDRC\u201d) under a series of contracts from August 1985 through June 2001. Dr. Ehrbar provided dental services to inmates at the Orient Correctional Institution. During her service with DRC, Dr. Ehrbar asked whether she could become a civil service employee and was told that she could not.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">PERS Determination of Dr. Ehrbar\u2019s Request for Service Credit</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">{\u00b6 3} After the conclusion of her last contract with DRC, Dr. Ehrbar asked PERS for a determination of her eligibility for PERS membership. Following an administrative process, PERS determined that she was not a public employee when she worked as a dentist at the Orient Correctional Institution from 1985 to 2001. PERS concluded that Dr. Ehrbar instead performed dental services as an independent contractor for that period. Dr. Ehrbar appealed the staff determination to the PERS retirement board, and the board appointed a hearing examiner to consider the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">{\u00b6 4} In March 2008, the hearing examiner issued a report and recommendation concluding that Dr. Ehrbar was a public employee from July 1, 1993, to June 30, 2001. The hearing examiner recommended that Dr. Ehrbar be granted PERS service credit for this period.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-9\">{\u00b6 5} At the board\u2019s September 17, 2008 meeting, ten of the 11 board members were present. Five of the board members voted to adopt the hearing examiner\u2019s report and recommendation, three members voted against adoption, and two members abstained.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-10\">{\u00b6 6} By letter dated September 29, 2008, the board informed the parties that it had \u201cvoted to accept the findings of fact and conclusions of law of the March 17, 2008 Report and Recommendation that Dr. Ehrbar was not a public employee while performing services for the Department of Rehabilitation and Corrections between August 1, 1985 to June 30, 1993, and is not eligible for OPERS coverage for this time period, but was a public employee between July 1, 1993 to June 30, 2001 and is eligible for OPERS coverage for this time period.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b144-11\">Mandamus Case</p>\n<p id=\"b144-12\">{\u00b6 7} On November 7, 2008, relators, DRC and its deputy director of human resources, Robert O.E. Keyes, filed this action for a writ of mandamus to compel the retirement board of PERS to (1) comply with Ohio Adm.Code 145-1-01 and obtain a majority vote of its members before taking official action on Dr. Ehrbar\u2019s claim and (2) find that Dr. Ehrbar was an independent contractor and not a public employee of DRC and was not eligible for PERS coverage during her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>employment at Orient Correctional Institution. PERS filed an answer, and Dr. Ehrbar filed a motion to intervene as a respondent along with an answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">{\u00b6 8} We granted the motion to intervene, granted an alternative writ, and issued a schedule for the presentation of evidence and briefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">{\u00b6 9} This cause is now before the court for a consideration of the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">Mandamus to Correct an Abuse of Discretion by PERS</p>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">{\u00b6 10} DRC and Keyes request a writ of mandamus to compel the PERS retirement board to comply with Ohio Adm.Code 145-1-01 before taking official action on Dr. Ehrbar\u2019s service-credit appeal. \u201c[M]andamus is an appropriate remedy where no statutory right of appeal is available to correct an abuse of discretion by an administrative body.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Pipoly v. State Teachers Retirement Sys., </em>95 Ohio St.3d 327, 2002-Ohio-2219, 767 N.E.2d 719, \u00b6 14. Because there is no statutory right to appeal the retirement board\u2019s decision on service credit, mandamus is appropriate. See <em>State ex rel. Schachter v. Ohio Pub. Emps. Retirement Bd., </em>121 Ohio St.3d 526, 2009-Ohio-1704, 905 N.E.2d 1210, \u00b6 24; R.C. 145.01(A)(4) (\u201cIn all cases of doubt, the public employees retirement board shall determine whether any person is a public employee, and its decision is final\u201d); Ohio Adm.Code 145-1-11(D) (\u201cThe retirement board\u2019s decision on any determination conducted pursuant to this rule shall be final and determinative\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b145-9\">{\u00b6 11} Therefore, to be entitled to the requested writ of mandamus, DRC and Keyes must establish that the PERS retirement board abused its discretion by construing the board\u2019s September 2008 vote as representing official board action. <em>State ex rel. Davis v. Pub. Emps. Retirement Bd., </em>120 Ohio St.3d 386, 2008-Ohio-6254, 899 N.E.2d 975, \u00b6 25. To prove an abuse of discretion, relators must show that the administrative decision was unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable. <em>Schachter, </em>at \u00b6 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-10\">Ohio Adm.Code 145-1-01(B)(5)</p>\n<p id=\"b145-11\">{\u00b6 12} The PERS retirement board has 11 members. R.C. 145.04. The retirement board is vested with the \u201cgeneral administration and management of the public employees retirement system.\u201d R.C. 145.04. The board \u201cmay adopt rules in accordance with section 111.15 of the Revised Code for the proper administration and management of this chapter.\u201d R.C. 145.09.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-12\">{\u00b6 13} One of the rules the board adopted is Ohio Adm.Code 145-1-01, which provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b145-13\">{\u00b6 14} \u201c(B) Meetings</p>\n<p id=\"AJRG\">{\u00b6 15} \"* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>{\u00b6 16} \u201c(5) A majority of the actual number of members that have been elected or appointed to and are serving on the board at the time of a meeting where official action is to be taken constitutes a quorum to conduct a meeting. <em>A majority of those members present voting yes on a proposal shall constitute a favorable vote. </em>An abstention from voting shall not be counted as either an affirmative or negative vote. A roll call shall occur if there is a division in the vote. Any board member may request a roll call on any vote.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">{\u00b6 17} DRC and Keyes assert that the retirement board abused its discretion by ignoring Ohio Adm.Code 145-1-01(B)(5) and treating its September 2008 vote on Dr. Ehrbar\u2019s appeal as an official board action. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">{\u00b6 18} Because ten of the 11 board members were present at the September 2008 meeting, there was a quorum to conduct the meeting. But only five of the ten members present voted yes on the motion to adopt the hearing examiner\u2019s report and recommendation. In construing Ohio Adm.Code 145 \u2014 1\u201401(B)(5), \u201c[w]e must read undefined words and phrases in context and construe them in accordance with rules of grammar and common usage.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Turner v. Eberlin, </em>117 Ohio St.3d 381, 2008-Ohio-1117, 884 N.E.2d 39, \u00b6 14. \u201cA majority always refers to more than half of some defined or assumed set.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (8th Ed. 2004) 974. Five is not more than half of ten. Therefore, the board\u2019s purported action at the meeting did not comply with the plain language of the administrative rule, and the motion to adopt the hearing examiner\u2019s report and recommendation was not approved.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">{\u00b6 19} Furthermore, even if Ohio Adm.Code 145-1-01(B)(5) were ambiguous, our conclusion is supported by subsection (B)(7) of the same rule, which provides that \u201c[w]hen a question of parliamentary procedure arises, the most current edition of \u2018Robert\u2019s Rules of Order\u2019 shall be followed unless in conflict with Chapter 145. of the Revised Code, or this rule.\u201d The most current edition of Robert\u2019s Rules of Order specifies that \u201cmajority\u201d means \u201cmore than half.\u201d Robert\u2019s Rules of Order Newly Revised (10th Ed.2000) 387, Section 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">{\u00b6 20} As noted, Ohio Adm.Code 145-1-01(B)(5) refers to \u201ca majority of those members present.\u201d For the phrase, a \u201cmajority of the members present,\u201d Robert\u2019s Rules of Order provides the following example:</p>\n<p id=\"b146-9\">{\u00b6 21} \u201cAssume, for example, that at a meeting of a society with a total membership of 150 and a quorum of 10, there are 30 members present, of whom 25 participate in a given counted vote (taken by rising, by show of hands, by roll call, or by ballot). Then, with respect to that vote:</p>\n<p id=\"b146-10\">{\u00b6 22} \u201cA majority is 13</p>\n<p id=\"b146-11\">{\u00b6 23} \u201cA majority of those present is 16.\u201d Id. at 389-390.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>{\u00b6 24} In accordance with Robert\u2019s Rules of Order, a majority of the ten members present at the retirement board\u2019s September 2008 meeting would be six, and because only five members voted to approve the hearing examiner\u2019s report and recommendation, the board did not approve it.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">{\u00b6 25} Moreover, the retirement board erroneously relies on the sentence in Ohio Adm.Code 145 \u2014 1\u201401(B)(5) that \u201c[a]n abstention from voting shall not be counted as either an affirmative or negative vote\u201d to support its recognition of the September 2008 vote as official action. The two members who abstained from the vote on the motion to approve the hearing examiner\u2019s report and recommendation were \u2014 in accordance with the rule \u2014 not counted as either affirmative or negative votes on the motion. These abstaining members, however, remained members <em>present </em>during the vote and had to be counted to determine whether the vote was sufficient to constitute a \u201cmajority of those members present\u201d under the rule. See also <em>Licht v. Storage Technology Corp. </em>(May 6, 2005), Del.Ch. No. Civ.A. 524-N, 2005 WL 1252355, *4, construing <em>Berlin v. Emerald Partners </em>(Del.1989), 552 A.2d 482 (\u201cGiven that the Supreme Court included abstentions among the shares entitled to vote, it is implicit in the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion * * * that an abstention, whether accomplished in person or through a proxy holder following his principal\u2019s instructions, is part of the \u2018voting power present\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">{\u00b6 26} Moreover, the retirement board\u2019s construction of the rule would add language to read either: \u201cA majority of those members present voting yes on a proposal shall constitute a favorable vote. An abstention from voting shall not be counted as either an affirmative or negative vote, <em>and a member who abstains shall not be counted as a member present to determine whether a majority needed for a favorable vote has been reached </em>\u201d or \u201cA majority of those members <em>present and voting </em>shall constitute <em>the required majority for board action.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) We cannot add or delete words in construing the pertinent language of the administrative rule. Cf. <em>State ex rel. Sapp v. Franklin Cty. Court of Appeals, </em>118 Ohio St.3d 368, 2008-Ohio-2637, 889 N.E.2d 500, \u00b6 26 (applying this interpretative rule in construing a statute). The phrase \u201ca majority of those members present and voting\u201d has a markedly different meaning from \u201ca majority of those members present.\u201d See generally Annotation, Abstention from Voting of Member of Municipal Council Present at Session as Affecting Requisite Voting Majority (1975), 63 A.L.R.3d 1072, Section 6[a], 1975 WL 37107.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">{\u00b6 27} In addition, the retirement board may remedy purported policy problems with the rule by amending it instead of requesting that this court do so by ignoring the rule\u2019s plain language.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">{\u00b6 28} Finally, although we accord the retirement board deference in interpreting its administrative rules, <em>State ex rel. Schaengold v. Ohio Pub. Emps. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number><em>Retirement Sys., </em>114 Ohio St.3d 147, 2007-Ohio-3760, 870 N.E.2d 719, \u00b6 23, we need not do so here because the board\u2019s interpretation of Ohio Adm.Code 145-1-01(B)(5) is unreasonable. See <em>Univ. of Toledo v. Heiny </em>(1987), 30 Ohio St.3d 143, 146, 30 OBR 454, 507 N.E.2d 1130.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A21\">Chester, Willcox &amp; Saxbe, L.L.P., Sarah D. Morrison, and Donald C. Brey, for relators.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b148-12\">Richard Cordray, Attorney General, and John T. Williams and Laura E. Parsons, Assistant Attorneys General, for respondent Ohio Public Employees Retirement System.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b148-13\">Christensen, Christensen, Donchatz, Kettlewell &amp; Owens, L.L.P., and Timothy J. Owens, for respondent Dr. Diane Ehrbar.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">Remaining Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">{\u00b6 29} DRC and Keyes next claim that the PERS retirement board abused its discretion in determining that 'Dr. Ehrbar was a public employee entitled to service credit for the period from July 1, 1993, to June 30, 2001. This claim is moot, however, because of our resolution of relators\u2019 first claim. We cannot review the merits of the retirement board\u2019s purported action, because the action was not an official action under Ohio Adm.Code 145-1-01(B)(5), i.e., the board did not adopt the hearing examiner\u2019s report and recommendation. This result is consistent with our well-settled precedent that we will not indulge in advisory opinions. <em>Davis, </em>120 Ohio St.3d 386, 2008-Ohio-6254, 899 N.E.2d 975, \u00b6 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">{\u00b6 30} Therefore, because the PERS retirement board abused its discretion by treating its September 2008 vote on Dr. Ehrbar\u2019s service-credit appeal as an official action by the requisite number of members of the board, we grant a writ of mandamus to compel the PERS to comply with Ohio Adm.Code 145-1-01 by obtaining a majority vote of the members present before taking official action on the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-9\">Writ granted.</p>\n<judges id=\"b148-10\">Moyer, C.J., and Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
