The writ compels Scioto County Court of Common Pleas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>Judge William T. Marshall to vacate the entries granting Rawlins relief from his murder conviction and sentence, convicting him of voluntary manslaughter, and releasing him from prison and also compels the judge to immediately return Rawlins to prison to continue serving the original murder sentence. Because the attorney general has common-law standing to institute this prohibition action and Judge Marshall patently and unambiguously lacked jurisdiction to vacate the murder conviction based on grounds that had previously been rejected by the court of appeals in Rawlins\u2019s direct appeal, we affirm the judgment granting the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">\n<em>Murder Conviction and Appeal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">{\u00b6 2} In April 1997, Rawlins shot and killed James Thomas, who had been having an affair with Rawlins\u2019s wife. Rawlins shot Thomas three times, including at least once from close range. Rawlins was charged with aggravated murder and a firearm specification. Following trial, a jury convicted Rawlins of murder with the firearm specification, and the Scioto County Court of Common Pleas sentenced him to a prison term of 15 years to life.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">{\u00b6 3} On appeal, the Court of Appeals for Scioto County affirmed. <em>State v. Rawlins </em>(Dec. 24, 1998), Scioto App. No. 97CA2539, 1998 WL 961056. The court of appeals rejected Rawlins\u2019s claims that the trial court erred by refusing to instruct the jury on the lesser offenses of involuntary manslaughter and voluntary manslaughter. Id. at *4-7. The court of appeals concluded that under any reasonable view of the evidence, the victim\u2019s death was purposeful and the alleged provocation was not reasonably sufficient to have incited Rawlins to use deadly force. Id. at *4, 7. We did not accept Rawlins\u2019s discretionary appeal for review. <em>State v. Rawlins </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 1489, 709 N.E.2d 1216.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-9\">\n<em>Motion for Relief from Judgment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b344-10\">{\u00b6 4} In 2003, Rawlins filed a motion in the common pleas court for relief from the judgment of conviction and sentence pursuant to Crim.R. 57(B)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and Civ.R. 60(B). Rawlins raised the same claims in his motion that he had in his previous, unsuccessful direct appeal. The Scioto County Prosecuting Attorney at that time filed a response opposing the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-11\">{\u00b6 5} In March 2005, Judge Marshall, who had not presided over Rawlins\u2019s trial, held a hearing on Rawlins\u2019s motion for relief from judgment. At the hearing, the judge orally granted the motion, accepted Rawlins\u2019s plea of guilty to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>voluntary manslaughter, sentenced Rawlins to ten years\u2019 imprisonment, and granted Rawlins a judicial release from prison. A new prosecuting attorney had taken office since the initial trial and the filing of the motion for relief from judgment. At the hearing, the assistant prosecuting attorney representing the state informed Judge Marshall that the state had no objection to Rawlins\u2019s motion for relief from judgment. The judge then noted that \u201cthe Court will make a finding with no objection from the State of Ohio that the verdict was against the manifest weight of the evidence and instead they should have been instructed on Voluntary Manslaughter * *</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">{\u00b6 6} In journal entries dated March 23, 2005, Judge Marshall granted Rawlins\u2019s motion for relief, convicted him of voluntary manslaughter, sentenced him to ten years in prison, and then released him. A couple of weeks later, the judge journalized detailed findings of fact and conclusions of law. He found that Rawlins was entitled to the requested relief from his murder conviction because \u201c[flailing to instruct the jury on involuntary and voluntary manslaughter violated [Rawlins\u2019s] Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial and his Fifth Amendment due process right to have the law accurately stated.\u201d He concluded that the evidence introduced at trial warranted jury instructions on the lesser offenses of voluntary manslaughter and involuntary manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">\n<em>Prohibition Case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">{\u00b6 7} In May 2005, then attorney general Jim Petro filed a complaint in the Scioto County Court of Appeals for a writ of prohibition to compel Judge Marshall to vacate his entries granting Rawlins\u2019s motion for relief from judgment, convicting him of voluntary manslaughter instead of murder, and releasing him from prison. After Judge Marshall filed an answer and he and the parties submitted briefs, the court of appeals granted the writ. <em>State ex rel. Petro v. Marshall, </em>Scioto App. No. 05CA3004, 2006-Ohio-5357, 2006 WL 2924762. Rawlins was then arrested and returned to prison to continue serving his murder sentence. Until that time, he had not been notified about the prohibition case.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">\n<em>Intervention, Appeal, and Remand</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b345-9\">{\u00b6 8} Three weeks after the court of appeals granted the writ, Rawlins filed a motion to intervene as a respondent in the prohibition case as well as a motion for relief from judgment. The court of appeals granted the motion to intervene and ordered the parties to file responses to the motion for relief from judgment. Rawlins appealed the judgment granting the writ to this court and also filed a motion for a limited remand so that the court of appeals could rule on his pending motion for relief from judgment. We granted the motion and remanded the cause for the court of appeals to rule on Rawlins\u2019s motion for relief from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>judgment. <em>State ex rel. Petro v. Marshall, </em>112 Ohio St.3d 1418, 2006-Ohio-6712, 859 N.E.2d 557.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">{\u00b6 9} On remand, the court of appeals granted Rawlins\u2019s motion and vacated its previous judgment granting the writ of prohibition. The court ordered that the parties submit evidence and briefs on the attorney general\u2019s prohibition claim and further ordered that Rawlins remain in prison during the pendency of the case. We granted Rawlins\u2019s application to dismiss his appeal from the vacated judgment. <em>State ex rel. Dann v. Marshall, </em>114 Ohio St.3d 1496, 2007-Ohio-4160, 871 N.E.2d 1197.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">{\u00b6 10} In November 2008, the court of appeals again granted the writ \u201c[b]ecause Judge Marshall did not have jurisdiction to grant Rawlins\u2019 Civ.R. 60(B) motion.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Rogers v. Marshall, </em>Scioto App. No. 05CA3004, 2008-Ohio-6341, 2008 WL 5104740, \u00b6 39.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">{\u00b6 11} This cause is now before the court upon Rawlins\u2019s appeal as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">Legal Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">\n<em>Standing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b346-9\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cBefore an Ohio court can consider the merits of a legal claim, the person or entity seeking relief must establish standing to sue.\u201d <em>Ohio Pyro, Inc. v. Ohio Dept. of Commerce, Div. of State Fire Marshal, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 375, 2007-Ohio-5024, 875 N.E.2d 550, \u00b6 27; <em>Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Commrs. v. State, </em>112 Ohio St.3d 59, 2006-Ohio-6499, 858 N.E.2d 330, \u00b6 22. In general, \u201ca prohibition action may only be commenced by a person who is either a party to the proceeding sought to be prohibited * * * or [who] demonstrates an injury in fact to a legally protected interest.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Matasy v. Morley </em>(1986), 25 Ohio St.3d 22, 23, 25 OBR 18, 494 N.E.2d 1146.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-10\">{\u00b6 13} The court of appeals determined that the attorney general had common-law standing to institute the prohibition action. <em>Rogers, </em>2008-Ohio-6341, 2008 WL 5104740, at \u00b6 14-19. Rawlins asserts that the court of appeals erred in so holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-11\">{\u00b6 14} In Ohio, the attorney general is a constitutional officer. Section 1, Article III, Ohio Constitution. In addition, the General Assembly has recognized the attorney general\u2019s status as the chief law officer for the state and has set forth the following duties:</p>\n<p id=\"b346-12\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cThe attorney general is the chief law officer for the state and all its departments and shall be provided with adequate office space in Columbus. Except as provided in division (E) of section 120.06 and in sections 3517.152 to 3517.157 of the Revised Code, no state officer or board, or head of a department or institution of the state shall employ, or be represented by, other counsel or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>attorneys at law. The attorney general shall appear for the state in the trial and argument of all civil and criminal causes in the supreme court in which the state is directly or indirectly interested. When required by the governor or the general assembly, the attorney general shall appear for the state in any court or tribunal in a cause in which the state is a party, or in which the state is directly interested. Upon the written request of the governor, the attorney general shall prosecute any person indicted for a crime.\u201d R.C. 109.02.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">{\u00b6 16} Rawlins asserts that the attorney general\u2019s liberal interpretation of his powers would render R.C. Chapter 109 meaningless. In essence, Rawlins contends that the attorney general\u2019s powers should be restricted to those specified by the General Assembly and that the attorney general thus has no standing in the underlying prohibition case because the case was not instituted in this court, and neither the governor nor the General Assembly requested that the attorney general bring the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">{\u00b6 17} Rawlins\u2019s assertion is incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">{\u00b6 18} We have held that \u201cwhen these constitutions were adopted (both state and federal), they were adopted with a recognition of established contemporaneous common-law principles; and * * * they did not repudiate, but cherished, the established common law.\u201d <em>State v. Wing </em>(1902), 66 Ohio St. 407, 420, 64 N.E. 514. \u201c \u2018[T]he general assembly will not be presumed to have intended to abrogate a settled rule of the common law unless the language used in a statute clearly supports such intention.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mandelbaum v. Mandelbaum, </em>121 Ohio St.3d 433, 2009-Ohio-1222, 905 N.E.2d 172, \u00b6 29, quoting <em>State ex rel. Hunt v. Fronizer </em>(1907), 77 Ohio St. 7, 16, 82 N.E. 518. Nothing in R.C. Chapter 109 appears to abrogate the attorney general\u2019s common-law powers within the limited context of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">{\u00b6 19} In <em>State ex rel. Little v. Dayton &amp; South-Eastern RR. Co. </em>(1881), 36 Ohio St. 434, we held that the attorney general has common-law \u2014 as well as statutory \u2014 authority to institute suits on behalf of the public and that the attorney general could bring the suit \u201cwithout a relator.\u201d Id. at 440. Similarly, in <em>State ex rel. Crabbe v. Plumb </em>(1927), 116 Ohio St. 428, 430, 156 N.E. 457, we held that \u201cthe Attorney General, being the chief law officer of the state and all the departments thereof, has authority to institute an action in mandamus against a public officer of the state to require him to discharge a duty placed upon him by a mandatory statute * * *.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b347-9\">{\u00b6 20} As the court of appeals persuasively concluded in granting the writ, \u201c[e]qually important legal interests are at stake here in the attorney general\u2019s efforts to obtain the common law writ of prohibition. If the attorney general can enjoin a public nuisance in the absence of an individual relator [as in Little], surely the attorney general can promote the proper allocation of judicial power <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>among Ohio\u2019s courts, notwithstanding the absence of the prosecuting attorney\u2019s participation.\u201d <em>Rogers, </em>2008-Ohio-6341, 2008 WL 5104740, at \u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">{\u00b6 21} Further, Rawlins mistakenly contends that the presence of the prosecuting attorney during the proceeding before Judge Marshall to vacate the murder conviction adequately represented the state\u2019s interests so that the attorney general is precluded from collaterally asserting the state\u2019s interests in a prohibition case.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">{\u00b6 22} The attorney general did not directly interfere with the local prosecutor\u2019s criminal prosecution of Rawlins. Instead, as the court of appeals concluded, the attorney general \u201cfiled a distinct civil action that seeks to prohibit a court from acting where it purportedly lacks jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Rogers, </em>2008-Ohio-6341, 2008 WL 5104740, at \u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">{\u00b6 23} Given the unique, limited nature of the attorney general\u2019s exercise of authority in this matter and the important statewide interests in reinstating a murder conviction vacated by a court without jurisdiction to do so, we hold that the attorney general had the requisite common-law standing to commence the prohibition action against Judge Marshall. The exercise of this authority under the unique, limited facts of this case is consistent with the common-law powers of the majority of state attorneys general. See generally Myers and Ross, State Attorneys General, Powers and Responsibilities (2 Ed. 2007) 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">\n<em>Prohibition Claim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b348-9\">{\u00b6 24} The court of appeals granted the attorney general a writ of prohibition to compel Judge Marshall to vacate his entries granting Rawlins relief from his murder conviction and sentence, convicting him of voluntary manslaughter, and releasing him from prison. The writ further ordered the judge to immediately return Rawlins to prison to continue serving his murder sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-10\">{\u00b6 25} To be entitled to the requested writ of prohibition, the attorney general had to establish that (1) Judge Marshall was about to exercise judicial or quasi-judicial power, (2) the exercise of that power was unauthorized by law, and (3) denying the writ would result in injury for which no other adequate remedy existed in the ordinary course of law. <em>State ex rel. Furnas v. Monnin, </em>120 Ohio St.3d 279, 2008-Ohio-5569, 898 N.E.2d 573, \u00b6 10. It is uncontroverted that Judge Marshall exercised judicial power in the underlying criminal case by vacating Rawlins\u2019s murder conviction and releasing him from prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-11\">{\u00b6 26} For the remaining requirements, \u201c[i]f a lower court patently and unambiguously lacks jurisdiction to proceed in a cause, prohibition * * * will issue to prevent any future unauthorized exercise of jurisdiction and to correct the results of prior jurisdictionally unauthorized actions.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Mayer v. Henson, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 276, 2002-Ohio-6323, 779 N.E.2d 223, \u00b6 12. The dispositive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>issue is whether Judge Marshall patently and unambiguously lacked jurisdiction to vacate Rawlins\u2019s murder conviction and release him from prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">\n<em>Patent and Unambiguous Lack of Jurisdiction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">{\u00b6 27} This case involves the doctrine of the law of the case. \u201cThe law of the case is a longstanding doctrine in Ohio jurisprudence.\u201d <em>Hopkins v. Dyer, </em>104 Ohio St.3d 461, 2004-Ohio-6769, 820 N.E.2d 329, \u00b6 15. \u201cThe portion of the [law-of-the-case] doctrine generally applied in extraordinary-writ cases provides that \u2018[ajbsent extraordinary circumstances, such as an intervening decision by the Supreme Court, an inferior court has no discretion to disregard the mandate of a superior court in a prior appeal in the same case.\u2019 \u201d <em>State ex rel. Dannaher v. Crawford </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 391, 394, 678 N.E.2d 549, quoting <em>Nolan v. Nolan </em>(1984), 11 Ohio St.3d 1, 11 OBR 1, 462 N.E.2d 410, syllabus; <em>State ex rel. Non-Employees of Chateau Estates Resident Assn. v. Kessler, </em>107 Ohio St.3d 197, 2005-Ohio-6182, 837 N.E.2d 778, \u00b6 14. \u201cThe doctrine is necessary to ensure consistency of results in a case, to avoid endless litigation by settling the issues, and to preserve the structure of superior and inferior courts as designed by the Ohio Constitution.\u201d <em>Hopkins, </em>at \u00b6 15; <em>Hubbard ex rel. Creed v. Sauline </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 402, 404, 659 N.E.2d 781.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">{\u00b6 28} Under the pertinent portion of the law-of-the-case doctrine, \u201c \u2018the decision of a reviewing court in a case remains the law of that case on the legal questions involved for all subsequent proceedings in the case at both the trial and reviewing levels.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hopkins, </em>at \u00b6 15, quoting <em>Nolan, </em>11 Ohio St.3d at 3, 11 OBR 1, 462 N.E.2d 410.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">{\u00b6 29} Rawlins first claims that the law of the case did not prevent Judge Marshall from vacating his murder conviction and releasing him from prison because the transcript of the hearing on his motion for relief from judgment established that the judge granted the motion based, in part, on the conviction\u2019s being against the manifest weight of the evidence, a claim that had not been raised by the parties or addressed by the court of appeals in his prior appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-9\">{\u00b6 30} Rawlins\u2019s claim lacks merit. In his subsequently journalized findings of fact, Judge Marshall found that the sole basis for his judgment granting Rawlins\u2019s motion for relief from the murder conviction and sentence was the common pleas court\u2019s refusal to instruct the jury on voluntary and involuntary manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-10\">{\u00b6 31} Rawlins next asserts that any failure by Judge Marshall to comply with the law of the case was a nonjurisdictional defect that is not cognizable by extraordinary relief in prohibition. As a general rule, courts of common pleas have jurisdiction to rule on postjudgment motions, including motions for relief from judgment. See, e.g., <em>State ex rel. Enyart v. O\u2019Neill </em>(1995), 71 Ohio St.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>655, 656, 646 N.E.2d 1110 (\u201cIn that [the common pleas court judge] possessed jurisdiction to rule on the Civ.R. 60(B) motion, the fact that she may have exercised that jurisdiction erroneously does not give rise to extraordinary relief by prohibition\u201d); <em>State ex rel. Gyurcsik v. Angelotta </em>(1977), 50 Ohio St.2d 345, 4 O.O.3d 482, 364 N.E.2d 284 (writ of prohibition denied in case in which trial court granted relief from judgment based on Civ.R. 60(B)(5)).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">{\u00b6 32} Rawlins\u2019s assertion, however, is again mistaken. We have expressly held that the Ohio Constitution \u201cdoes not grant to a court of common pleas jurisdiction to review a prior mandate of a court of appeals.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Potain v. Mathews </em>(1979), 59 Ohio St.2d 29, 32, 13 O.O.3d 17, 391 N.E.2d 343; <em>State ex rel. Heck v. Kessler </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 98, 104, 647 N.E.2d 792. Therefore, \u201ca writ of prohibition is an appropriate remedy to prevent a lower court from proceeding contrary to the mandate of a superior court.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Crandall, Pheils &amp; Wisniewski v. DeCessna </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 180, 182, 652 N.E.2d 742; <em>State ex rel. Smith v. O\u2019Connor </em>(1995), 71 Ohio St.3d 660, 662, 646 N.E.2d 1115.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">{\u00b6 33} Similarly, in <em>State ex rel. Special Prosecutors v. Judges, Court of Common Pleas </em>(1978), 55 Ohio St.2d 94, 9 O.O.3d 88, 378 N.E.2d 162, we granted a writ of prohibition to prevent a trial from proceeding when the trial court had granted a motion to withdraw a guilty plea after the conviction and sentence based on the plea had been affirmed on appeal. By so holding, we concluded that the trial court had no power to vacate a judgment that has been affirmed by the appellate court, \u201cfor this action would affect the decision of the reviewing court, which is not within the power of a trial court to do.\u201d Id., 55 Ohio St.2d at 98, 9 O.O.3d 88, 378 N.E.2d 162.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">{\u00b6 34} Notwithstanding Rawlins\u2019s claim to the contrary, we did not overrule <em>Potain, </em>59 Ohio St.2d 29, 13 O.O.3d 17, 391 N.E.2d 343, sub silentio in <em>State v. Payne, </em>114 Ohio St.3d 502, 2007-Ohio-4642, 873 N.E.2d 306, and <em>Pratts v. Hurley, </em>102 Ohio St.3d 81, 2004-Ohio-1980, 806 N.E.2d 992. Neither <em>Payne </em>nor <em>Pratts </em>involved a lower court\u2019s disregarding the mandate of a reviewing court in a prior appeal in the same case.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">{\u00b6 35} Rawlins\u2019s reliance on our dismissal of an original action instituted by a former attorney general for writs of mandamus and prohibition is also misplaced. See <em>State ex rel. Montgomery v. Bolt-Meredith </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 1475, 733 N.E.2d 250. That case was not premised upon the law of the case or our holding in <em>Potain. </em>Unlike in this case, <em>Montgomery </em>sought to vacate a trial court order granting relief to a defendant on grounds not resolved in the previous appeal. While new arguments are barred by the res judicata portion of the law-of-the-case doctrine, see <em>Creed, </em>74 Ohio St.3d at 405, 659 N.E.2d 781, res judicata \u2014 unlike the portion of the law-of-the-case doctrine at issue here \u2014 is not a basis for extraordinary relief in prohibition. See <em>State ex rel. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number><em>Henson, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 33, 2002-Ohio-2851, 770 N.E.2d 580, \u00b6 11; <em>State ex rel. Whiteside v. Fais </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 463, 464, 746 N.E.2d 1113. And the preeminent claim in Montgomery was whether the Crim.R. 33(B) new-trial timeliness requirements were jurisdictional. There is no comparable claim at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">{\u00b6 36} For these reasons, Judge Marshall\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction to grant the motion on the same grounds that had been previously rejected on appeal in the same case was unauthorized. Moreover, this lack of jurisdiction was patent and unambiguous. Under these circumstances, Rawlins\u2019s argument that the state has an adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law through its local representative \u2014 the prosecuting attorney \u2014 is thus without merit. \u201cWhere jurisdiction is patently and unambiguously lacking, [a relator] need not establish the lack of an adequate remedy at law because the availability of alternate remedies like appeal would be immaterial.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Sapp v. Franklin Cty. Court of Appeals, </em>118 Ohio St.3d 368, 2008-Ohio-2637, 889 N.E.2d 500, \u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">\n<em>Res Judicata, Waiver, and Laches</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">{\u00b6 37} Rawlins finally claims that res judicata, waiver, and laches barred the attorney general\u2019s prohibition claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">{\u00b6 38} These defenses are inapplicable here. Res judicata \u201cpresupposes a judgment entered by a court of competent jurisdiction.\u201d State <em>ex rel. Rose v. Ohio Dept. of Rehab, and Corr. </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 453, 455, 746 N.E.2d 1103. Judge Marshall lacked jurisdiction to disregard the mandate of the court of appeals established in Rawlins\u2019s direct appeal when Rawlins\u2019s motion raised the same claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-9\">{\u00b6 39} Nor can waiver apply to a challenge to the subject-matter jurisdiction of a court. <em>Rosen v. Celebrezze, </em>117 Ohio St.3d 241, 2008-Ohio-853, 883 N.E.2d 420, \u00b6 45.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-10\">{\u00b6 40} Laches is also inapplicable because Rawlins ultimately received a full and fair opportunity to contest the writ sought by the attorney general. See <em>State ex rel. King v. Summit Cty. Council, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 172, 2003-Ohio-3050, 789 N.E.2d 1108, \u00b629, quoting <em>State ex rel. Roadway Express v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 510, 514, 696 N.E.2d 1064 (\u201cfor laches to apply, \u2018prejudice is ordinarily represented by a respondent\u2019s inability to defend due to the passage of time\u2019 \u201d). Rawlins\u2019s ability to defend against the attorney general\u2019s prohibition claim was not prejudiced here.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-11\">\n<em>Oral Argument</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b351-12\">{\u00b6 41} We deny Rawlins\u2019s motion for oral argument. This case does not involve issues of factual complexity, substantive constitutional considerations, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>conflict between courts of appeals. And although this appeal does raise interesting issues of arguable legal significance, the parties\u2019 briefs are sufficient to permit a resolution of the case. See <em>State ex rel. Sawicki v. Lucas Cty. Court of Common Pleas, </em>121 Ohio St.3d 507, 2009-Ohio-1523, 905 N.E.2d 1192, \u00b6 32; <em>State ex rel. Allen v. Warren Cty.

Judge Marshall patently and unambiguously lacked jurisdiction to grant a motion for relief from a murder conviction and sentence based on claims that had previously been rejected by the court of appeals in an appeal in the same case. Consequently, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals granting the writ of prohibition. By so holding, we need not address the attorney general\u2019s alternate argument for affirmance \u2014 that Judge Marshall lacked jurisdiction over Rawlins\u2019s motion for relief from judgment, which should have been treated as an untimely petition for postconviction relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b352-7\">Moyer, C.J., and Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b352-8\">Pfeifer, J., concurs in judgment only.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b343-15\">.
