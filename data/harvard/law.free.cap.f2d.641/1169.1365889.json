BROWN, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1226-16\">On February 28, 1980, the District Court entered an injunction ordering Appel-Iant/DeFelice to remove the sand and other fill materials which he had placed in the Cheniere Traverse Canal. His actions constituted an attempt to restore access to his property. The Court found DeFelice\u2019s actions violated provisions of the 1899 Rivers and Harbors Act (RHA) and Federal Water Pollution Control Act (FWPCA) which require the authorization of the United States Corps of Engineers (Corps) prior to any construction or polluting in any of the \u201cnavigable waters of the United States.\u201d Our review of the facts, applicable statutes and code regulations, require us to affirm the District Court\u2019s actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-17\">\n<em>I. Up The Proverbial Creek Without A Permit</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-18\">The present controversy arises out of a purchase of property by the DeFelice family in Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana in 1944. Because the land was accessible only through the property owned by Citrus Lands of Louisiana, the purchase agreement included a right of access through Citrus Lands\u2019 property to a shell-surfaced roadway atop a dam which crossed a man-made drainage canal \u2014 commonly known as the Cheniere Traverse Canal (West Canal).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Eventually, the right of access lands were sold to a private individual in 1959 by Citrus Lands Inc. When the DeFelices refused to sell their property to this same individual, a gate was placed across the right-of-way which left the property inaccessible except by water. At about this same time, unknown persons started cutting away at the dam across the canal until it was completely destroyed by late 1965 or early 1966.</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-19\">DeFelice\u2019s attempts at negotiations with the adjacent landowners to remove the gate proved fruitless. Suit was filed in 1974 which resulted in the decision of <em>DeFelice </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1171\">*1171</page-number><em>Land Corp. v. Citrus Land of La., </em>330 So.2d 631 (La.App. 4th Cir. 1976), granting the DeFelice family right of access to and egress from the property at the point it had previously exercised under the original agreement. Pursuant to this judgment, an order was entered by the District Court for a survey to establish the metes and bounds of the original right-of-way. In July 1977, in recognition of this legally established right of passage, DeFelice began to reconstruct the dam by placing sand and other fill materials in the canal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On July 17, 1977, an investigator of the Corps appeared at the proposed dam site and ordered the work stopped.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After several unsuccessful attempts to serve a cease and desist order, one was sent by certified mail to DeFelice alleging that he was in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 9,10 of the 1899 (RHA), 33 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 401, 403,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and \u00a7\u00a7 301(a), 404(a) of the (FWPCA), 33 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1311(a), 1344(a)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>, for failing to obtain respectively dam construction and pollutant discharge permits.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1227-13\">The Corps subsequently initiated litigation against DeFelice seeking an injunction and order to remove the material which he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1172\">*1172</page-number>had placed in the canal. DeFelice counterclaimed for the value of the property taken from him by the Corps\u2019 actions.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Testimony from surrounding residents whose access to other canals leading to the Gulf of Mexico had been blocked by the DeFelice\u2019s dam, led the District Court to find that the materials placed in the canal had reduced the depth of the water and impaired navigation. The Court entered an injunction on February 28, 1980, and ordered DeFelice to remove this material in an amount sufficient to restore the depth of the water and the contour of the canal adjacent to the dam site to its pre-1977 condition.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1228-4\">DeFelice seeks a review of this judgment alleging that the District Court erred (i) in finding that the Corps had jurisdiction over the replacement of the dam in a private canal based upon the alleged \u201cnavigability\u201d of the canal, and (ii) in accepting the Corps\u2019 interpretation of the phrase \u201ccurrently serviceable\u201d as used in the regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-5\">\n<em>The Ebb And Flow Of \u201cNavigability Corps\u2019 Jurisdiction?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-6\">The principal question on appeal is whether the District Court correctly found that the Corps had jurisdiction by operation of law from the time the canal became capable of navigation under \u00a7 10 of the (RHA), 33 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 403. (See n.4, <em>supra)</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark><em>. </em>The focal point then becomes the correct standard for determining \u201cnavigability\u201d and ultimately Corps\u2019 jurisdiction. The Court below held that the mere capability of navigability in commercial use and/or the fact that the canal was subject to the ebb and flow of the tide was sufficient to establish Corps\u2019 jurisdiction even over a private and artificial canal. That finding was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-11\">The Corps has adopted the following <em>general </em>definitions of \u201cnavigable waters of the United States\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1228-12\">\u00a7 329.3 General policies.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1228-13\">Precise definitions of \u201cnavigable waters\u201d or \u201cnavigability\u201d are ultimately dependent on judicial interpretation, and cannot be made conclusively by administrative agencies. However, the policies and criteria contained in this regulation are in close conformance with the tests used by the Federal Courts and determinations made under this regulation are considered binding in regard to the activities of the Corps of Engineers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1228-14\">\u00a7 329.4 General definition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1228-15\">Navigable waters of the United States are those waters that are subject to the ebb and flow of the tide and/or are presently used, or have been used in the past, or may be susceptible for use to transport interstate or foreign commerce. A determination of navigability, once made, applies laterally over the entire surface of the waterbody, and is not extinguished by later actions or events which impede or destroy navigable capacity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1228-16\">\u00a7 329.5 General scope of determination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1228-17\">The several factors which must be examined when making a determination whether a waterbody is a navigable water of the United States are discussed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1173\">*1173</page-number>in detail below. Generally, the following conditions must be satisfied:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1229-5\">(a) Past, present, or potential presence of interstate or foreign commerce;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1229-6\">(b) Physical capabilities for use by commerce as in subparagraph (a) above; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1229-7\">(c) Defined geographic limits of the waterbody.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1229-8\">\u00a7 329.8 Improved or natural conditions of the waterbody.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1229-10\">Determinations are not limited to the natural or original condition of the water-body. Navigability may also be found where artifical [sic] aids have been or may be used to make the waterbody sutiable [sic] for use in navigation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1229-11\">(a) <em>Existing improvements: artifical [sic] \u25a0 waterbodies. </em>(1) An artifical [sic] channel may often constitute a navigable water of the United States, even though it has been privately developed and maintained, or passes through private property. The test is generally as developed above, that is, whether the waterbody is capable of use to transport interstate commerce. Canals which connect two navigable waters of the United States and which are used for commerce clearly fall within the test, and themselves become navigable. A canal open to navigable waters of the United States on only one end is itself navigable where it in fact supports interstate commerce. A canal or other artifical [sic] waterbody that is subject to ebb and flow of the tide is also a navigable water of the United States.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1229-13\">(2) The artificial waterbody may be a major portion of a river or harbor area or merely a minor backwash, slip, or turning area. (See \u00a7 329.12(b).)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1229-14\">(3) Private ownership of the lands underlying the waterbody, or of the lands through which it runs, does not preclude a finding of navigability. Ownership does become a controlling factor if a privately constructed and operated canal is not used to transport interstate commerce nor used by the public; it is then not considered to be a navigable water of the United States. However, a private waterbody, even though not itself navigable, may so affect the navigable capacity of nearby waters as to nevertheless be subject to certain regulatory authorities.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AK3\">33 CFR \u00a7 329.4, 329.8(a)(1) (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-17\">The Supreme Court recently quoted this definition with obvious approval in <em>Kaiser Aetna v. United States, </em>444 U.S. 164, 172 n.6, 100 S.Ct. 383, 388 n.6, 62 L.Ed.2d 332, 341 n.6 (1979). DeFelice, however, rejects the above definition of \u201cnavigability\u201d and the District Court\u2019s apparent reliance on it to sustain Corps\u2019 jurisdiction. Instead, he maintains that the canal waters are not \u201cnavigable waters of the United States\u201d because the canal in question is a (i) private and artificial canal and (ii) there was no factual finding to support a conclusion that the canal was a part of a \u201ccontinuous waterway sustaining interstate commerce.\u201d DeFelice suggests that the correct standard of \u201cnavigability\u201d should be a two-step finding of (i) navigability in fact and (ii) connection with a continuous waterway system \u2014 neither of which was met here. Moreover, he complains that jurisdiction should not rest on the result of an illegal act \u2014 the wrongful removal of the dam\u2014 which ultimately rendered the canal navigable in fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-18\">Neither the record<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> nor case law supports DeFeliee\u2019s idea that the Corps lacks jurisdiction because the canal was artificial and are privately owned. <em>See, e. g., Kaiser Aetna v. United States, </em>444 U.S. 164, 100 S.Ct. 383, 62 L.Ed.2d 332 (1979) (private waterway may come within term \u201cnavigable waters of the United States if joining existing interstate commerce waterway)\u201d; <em>United States v. Saxton Cove Estates, Inc., </em>526 F.2d 1293 (5th Cir. 1976) (private canals above the mean high line opening into navigable waterway subject to Corps\u2019 jurisdiction); <em>United States v. Joseph G. Moretti, Inc., </em>526 F.2d 1306 (5th Cir. 1976) (dredging of private canal upstream subject to Corps\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1174\">*1174</page-number>jurisdiction where navigable waters were affected downstream).</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-4\">Applying DeFelice\u2019s suggested standard for the moment, we find that the record does conclusively demonstrate that Cheniere Traverse Canal is (i) tidal \u2014 a fact stipulated to by both parties, (ii) navigable in fact \u2014 has in the past, does presently or is capable of supporting transportation in interstate or foreign commerce, and (iii) connected with a continuous interstate waterway. Several witnesses who had leased campsites along the canal beginning in the early 1960s testified that their 28-30 foot Lafayette Skiff type shrimping vessels were too large to safely maneuver in other near-by water routes except in the connecting canals of Cheniere Traverse, Timbers and Wilkinson.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In addition, the same testimony with the aid of United States Geological Survey Maps unmistakably demonstrates that these connecting canals flow into the Gulf of Mexico and thus form a part of a continuous interstate waterway system.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1230-7\">In reaching its decision the District Court relied on <em>United States v. Stoeco Homes, Inc., </em>498 F.2d 597 (3d Cir. 1974) which holds that once the artificial canals are connected to tidal water bodies, it and all its inland artificial tributaries become \u201cnavigable waters of the United States\u201d by operation of law. <em>Stoeco, </em>498 F.2d at 611. This Court has followed that concept in the case of <em>United States v. Saxton Cove Estates, Inc., </em>526 F.2d 1293 (5th Cir. 1976), where Corps\u2019 jurisdiction was upheld over five canals connecting to Black Water Sound which was a tidal water body. In urging this Court to adopt the two-step test for \u201cnavigability\u201d, DeFelice has apparently confused the requirements of \u201cnavigable waters of the United States\u201d for tidal coastal waters, with the requirements for non-tidal inland waters. We make this assumption because of the cases which DeFelice relies on in support of this proposition.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> These cases are inapplicable because they deal with <em>landlocked, non-tidal </em>water bodies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1175\">*1175</page-number>where the Courts have generally required a connection with other interstate waterways <footnotemark>14</footnotemark> unless the waterway is in fact navigated regularly by vessels in commerce. As previously established Cheniere Traverse Canal is <em>not </em>landlocked, and <em>is </em>tidal. Tidal waters by their very nature form a continuous water body with interstate waterways. Requiring tidal water bodies to meet the test for non-tidal, navigable in fact water bodies (which coincidentally they do here anyway) is really to eliminate the ebb and flow test. The law is to the contrary because even shallow tidal areas, like sloughs or marshes below the elevation of a mean high water line, are subject to regulation under the 1899 RHA. <em>Stoeco Homes, </em>498 F.2d at 597.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1231-5\">We conclude that the District Court applied the correct standard of \u201cnavigability\u201d in this case<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and that Cheniere Traverse Canal by 1965 or 1966 became navigable by operation of law, because (i) it was subject to ebb and flow and (ii) navigable in fact because it was an arm in the flow of interstate commerce to the Gulf of Mexico.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1231-6\"><em>Rising Waters? </em>\u2014 Dam <em>Not \u201cCurrently Serviceable\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1231-7\">The second point which DeFeliee challenges concerns the Corps\u2019 interpretation of the phrase \u201ccurrently serviceable\u201d in the regulation as it applies to an exemption to the permit requirements found in 33 CFR \u00a7 322.4(c). (See Appendix I). The real question is can a dam which disappeared no later than 1966 be considered \u201ccurrently serviceable\u201d within the meaning of the 1977 regulation? We think not. Government witnesses testified that the Corps\u2019 interpretation of \u201ccurrently serviceable\u201d means that the structure was providing the service for which it was intended at the existing time. The Corps uses a rule of reasonableness as to how soon after a work or structure is torn out it must be replaced. A reasonable length of time is defined as a time period in which there could have been no real change in circumstances surrounding the structure. If an otherwise Corps regulated structure exists and performs a service, it may normally be maintained and repaired without individual \u00a7 10 or \u00a7 404 permits. If not, an individual permit is normally needed first, and any changed circumstance since the structure\u2019s last existence will be carefully weighed. This balanced approach is clearly reasonable. The record here indicates that there had been real changes in circumstances at the dam site. After the prior dam was removed, there was an influx of campers and fishermen who invested in campsites and boats <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1176\">*1176</page-number>for their pleasure as well as commercial fishing based on the navigability of the canal. Considering the facts (i) changed circumstances, and (ii) that prior to DeFelice\u2019s attempt to ever bring suit, the dam had not been in existence for at least nine years, the Court upheld the Corps\u2019 interpretation of its regulations as a reasonable one. The reasonable interpretation by an agency of its own regulations is allowed great deference. <em>Udall v. Tallmann, </em>380 U.S. 1, 85 S.Ct. 792, 13 L.Ed.2d 616 (1955); <em>Soliz v. Plunkett, </em>615 F.2d 272 (5th Cir. 1980); <em>Kinnett Dairies, Inc. v. Farrow, </em>580 F.2d 1260 (5th Cir. 1978); <em>Bone v. Hibernia Bank, </em>493 F.2d 135 (5th Cir. 1974). The District Court\u2019s finding that this interpretation is reasonable is another way of saying it was not arbitrary, capricious or an abuse of discretion. We affirm this finding as well.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1233-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1177\">*1177</page-number>DeFelice\u2019s action in placing fill materials into the Cheniere Traverse Canal \u2014 a \u201cnavigable water of the United States\u201d \u2014 without a permit, evoked the Corps\u2019 jurisdiction and constituted a clear violation of RHA and FWPCA.

This part identifies the various Federal statutes that require Department of the Army permits before these activities can be lawfully undertaken; the related Federal legislation applicable to the review of each activity that requires a Department of the Army permit; and the general policies that are applicable to the review of all activities that require Department of the Army permits. Parts 321-324 address the various types of activities that require Department of the Army permits, including special policies and procedures applicable to those activities as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-20\">(1) Dams or dikes in navigable waters of the United States (Part 321);</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-21\">(2) All other structures or work including excavation, dredging, and/or disposal activities, in navigable waters of the United States (Part 322);</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-22\">(3) All activities that alter or modify the course, condition, location, or capacity of a navigable water of the United States (Part 322);</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-23\">(4) Construction of fixed structures and artificial islands on the outer continental shelf (Part 322);</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-24\">(5) All discharges of dredged or fill material into the waters of the United States (Part 323); and</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-25\">(6) All activities involving the transportation of dredged material for the purpose of dumping it in ocean waters (Part 324).</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-26\">\u201cnavigable waters of the United States\u201d and \u201cwaters of the United States\u201d are used frequently throughout these regulations, and it is important that the reader understand the difference from the outset. \u201cNavigable waters of the United States\u201d are defined in 33 CFR 329. These are the traditional waters where permits are required for work or structures pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1178\">*1178</page-number>sections 9 and 10 of the River and Harbor Act of 1899. \u201cWaters of the United States\u201d are defined in 38 CFR 323.2(a).

Where the navigable portions of the waterbody lie wholly within the limits of a single State, the structure may be built under authority of the legislature of that State, if the location and plans or any modification thereof, are approved by the Chief of Engineers and by the Secretary of the Army. The instrument of authorization is designated a permit. Section 9 also pertains to bridges and causeways but the authority of the Secretary of the Army and Chief of Engineers with respect to bridges and causeways was transferred to the Secretary of Transportation under the Department of Transportation Act of October 15, 1966 (80 Stat. 941, 49 U.S.C. 1155g(6)(A)). See also 33 CFR Part 321. A Department of the Army authorization is required for the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States associated with bridges and causeways pursuant to Section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972 (33 U.S.C. 1344).

The construction of any structure in or over any navigable water of the United States, the excavation from or depositing of material in such waters, or the accomplishment of any other work affecting the course, location, condition, or capacity of such waters, is unlawful unless the work has been recommended by the Chief of Engineers and authorized by the Secretary of the Army. The instrument of authorization is designated a permit, general permit, or letter of permission. The authority of the Secretary of the Army to prevent obstructions to navigation in the navigable waters of the United States was extended to artificial islands and fixed structures located on the outer continental shelf by Section 4(f) of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act of 1953 (67 Stat. 463; 43 U.S.C. 1333(f)).

The site of the unauthorized canal closure in the Cheniere Traverse (or West) Canal is about two hundred (200) feet east of the Canal\u2019s junction with the Timber Canal.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1230-10\">. The Court in <em>Minnehaha Creek Watershed Dist. v. Hoffmann, </em>597 F.2d 617 (8th Cir. 1978) found that there was no RHA jurisdiction over a non-tidal inland lake located entirely within one state, Minnesota, and with only one outlet to the Mississippi River which had been continuously dammed since 1852. The Court based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1175\">*1175</page-number>its holding upon the lack of an interstate waterway connection. Similarly, in <em>National Wildlife Federation v. Alexander, </em>613 F.2d 1054 (D.C.Cir.1979), the Court held that a historical navigable, non-tidal, landlocked lake located in North Dakota was not subject to \u00a7 10 of RHA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1231-10\">. The inapplicability of these two cases (see n.13, supra) is further highlighted by DeFelice\u2019s reliance on the cases of <em>The Daniel Ball, </em>77 U.S. (10 Wall) 557, 19 L.Ed. 999 (1870), and <em>The Genesee Chief, </em>53 U.S. (12 How.) 443, 13 L.Ed. 1058 (1851) which dealt with expanding admiralty jurisdiction beyond coastal tide waters to the inland non-tidal rivers of the United States. These cases did not reject the tidal theory over coastal waters. Rather, the Court chose not to apply it because that would have unduly limited jurisdiction over inland waters.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b1231-11\">. There are numerous cases holding that ebb and flow of the tide is a valid test of navigability of tidal waters for the Corps\u2019 jurisdiction under RHA. <em>See Kaiser Aetna </em>v. <em>United States, </em>444 U.S. 164, 100 S.Ct. 383, 62 L.Ed.2d 332 (1979); <em>United States v. Stoeco Homes, Inc., </em>498 F.2d 597 (3rd Cir. 1974); <em>Leslie Salt Co. v. Froehlke, </em>578 F.2d 742 (9th Cir. 1978); <em>Tatum v.

The Supreme Court recently conceded in <em>Kaiser Aetna, </em>that precedent does not disclose a single test or standard for navigability, but instead recognizes several distinct tests, (i) ebb and flow, (ii) connection with a continuous interstate waterway, (iii) navigable capacity, and (iv) navigable in fact. 444 U.S. at 170-172, 100 S.Ct. at 387-389, 62 L.Ed.2d at 340-41.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b1231-15\">. Having illustrated that Corps jurisdiction occurred by operation of law, we find no merit in DeFelice\u2019s argument that jurisdiction was improperly created due to an unauthorized or illegal act. Besides, DeFeliee presented no evidence at trial pertaining to this issue and on appeal has failed to cite any law to support his position.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b1232-4\">. Related to the above argument, that DeFelice is exempt by regulation from obtaining the permit required by \u00a7 10 of the RHA of 1899, is the argument by DeFelice that he is exempt by regulations from obtaining a permit required by \u00a7 404 of the FWPCA, 33 U.S.C.A. 1344 <em>(see </em>n.4, <em>supra). </em>DeFelice admits that the permit required by 33 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1344 would be applicable to the fill he was dumping-into the canal but for an alleged exemption in the regulation. DeFelice relies on 33 CFR 209.120e(2)(iii) (1976) which language was carried over into the 1977 regulations.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1232-5\">\u00a7 209.120 Permits for activities in Navigable Waters or Ocean Waters.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1232-6\">(e) <em>Activities Requiring Authorizations. </em>(1) Structures or work in navigable waters of the United States. Department of the Army authorizations are required under the River and Harbor Act of 1899 (See paragraph (b) of this section) for all structures or work in navigable waters of the United States except for bridges and causeways (see Appendix A), the placement of aids to navigation by the U. S. Coast Guards, structures constructed in artificial canals within principally residential developments where the canal has been connected to a navigable water of the United States (see paragraph (g)(ll) of this section), and activities that were commenced or completed shoreward of established harbor lines before May 27, 1970 (see 33 CFR \u00a7 209.150) other than those activities involving the discharge of dredged or fill material in navigable waters after October 18, 1972.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1232-7\">(2) <em>Discharges of dredged material or of fill material into navigable waters, </em>(i) Except as provided in subparagraphs (2)(ii) and (iii) of this paragraph, Department of the Army permits will be required for the discharge of dredged material or of fill material into navigable waters in accordance with the following phased schedule:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1232-8\">(iii) Discharges of dredged or fill material in waters other than navigable waters of the United States that have been completed by the effective date of this regulation and discharges of dredged or fill material of -less than 500 cubic yards into waters other than navigable waters of the United States that are part of an activity that was commenced before the publication of this regulation, that will be completed within six months of the publication of this regulation, and that involves a single and complete project and not a number of projects associated with complete development plans are hereby authorized for purposes of Section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act without further processing under this regulation: <em>Provided, however, </em>That the exemption of these types of activities from the requirements of this regulation shall not be construed as a waiver of the requirement to obtain a State water-quality certification under section 401 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act or a certification of compliance with a State\u2019s approved coastal zone management program pursuant to section 307(c)(3) of the Coastal Zone Management Act in those cases where the discharge of dredged or fill material has not been completed by the date of this regulation: <em>And further provided, </em>That the procedures of this regulation shall apply to any activity involving the discharge of dredged or fill material commenced before the date of this regulation if the District Engineer determines that the interests of water quality as expressed in the guidelines (see 40 CFR Part 230) so require. The term \u201ccommenced\" as used herein shall be satisfied if there has been, before the date of this regulation, some discharge of dredged or fill material into the navigable water as a part of the above activity or an entering into of a written contractual obligation to have the dredged or fill material discharged at a designated disposal site by a contractor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1232-11\">This regulation is obviously inapplicable. It provides that discharges of fill material, completed prior to the effective date of the regulation, \u201cinto waters other than navigable waters of the United States that were part of an activity which commenced before the publication of the regulation, that will be completed within six months of the publication of this regulation\u201d are authorized for purposes of \u00a7 404 FWPCA. DeFelice\u2019s activities were neither completed before the effective date of the regulation, nor started six months before publication of the regulation. Nor was the discharge into \u201cwaters other than navigable waters of the United States.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AyL\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1177\">*1177</page-number>Substantially the same permission for \u201creplacement of any previously authorized, currently serviceable fill\u201d is applicable to \u00a7 404 of the FWPCA, as was applicable to permits required under \u00a7 10 of the RHA of 1899. However, for the same reasons as those stated in the text above, the fill deposited by DeFelice in July 1977 would not be replacement of \u201ccurrently serviceable\u201d fill for purposes of \u00a7 404 of the FWPCA for the same reason it was not \u201ccurrently serviceable\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 10 permit. It is clear that DeFelice is not exempt from the permit requirement by \u00a7 404 FWPCA. Therefore, this is an independent ground to support the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"Ayd\">DeFelice also argues that the regulations published July 19, 1977, 42 Fed.Reg. 37122 <em>et seq., </em>are inapplicable because they could not go into effect for thirty days after publication. This argument is irrelevant because the District Court has determined, as we do, that DeFelice violated the statutes, \u00a7\u00a7 9, 10 of the RHA and \u00a7 404 of the FWPCA, which must stand even if there were no regulations involved.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1236-13\">. The terminology used by the FWPCA is \u201cnavigable waters\u201d which is defined in Section 502(7) of the Act as \u201cwaters of the United States including the territorial seas.\u201d For pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1181\">*1181</page-number>poses of clarity, and to avoid confusion with other Corps of Engineers regulatory programs, the term \u201cwaters of the United States\u201d is used throughout this regulation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1237-10\">. In defining the jurisdiction of the FWPCA as the \u201cwaters of the United States,\u201d Congress, in the legislative history to the Act, specified that the term \u201cbe given the broadest constitutional interpretation unencumbered by agency determinations which would have been made or may be made for administrative purposes.\u201d The waters listed in paragraphs (a)(1) \u2014 (4) fall within this mandate as discharges into those water-bodies may seriously affect water quality, navigation, and other Federal interests; however, it is also recognized that the Federal government would have the right to regulate the waters of the United States identified in paragraph (a)(5) under this broad Congressional mandate to fulfill the objective of the Act: \u201cto restore and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the Nation\u2019s waters\u201d (Section 101(a)). Paragraph (a)(5) incorporates all other waters of the United States that could be regulated under the Federal government\u2019s Constitutional powers to regulate and protect interstate commerce, including those for which the connection to interstate commerce may not be readily obvious or where the location or size of the waterbody generally may not require regulation through individual or general permits to achieve the objective of the Act. Discharges of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States identified in paragraphs (a)(l)(4) will generally require individual or general permits unless those discharges occur beyond the headwaters of a river or stream or in natural lakes less than 10 acres in surface area. Discharges into these latter waters and into most of the waters identified in paragraph (a)(5) will be permitted by this regulation, subject to the provisions listed in paragraph 323.4-2(b) unless the District Engineer develops information, on a case-by-case basis, that the concerns- for the aquatic environment as expressed in the EPA Guidelines (40 CFR 230) require regulation through an individual or general permit.
