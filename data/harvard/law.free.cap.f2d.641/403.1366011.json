HILL, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Ay0\">with whom AINSWORTH, TJOFLAT, FAY, HENDERSON and POLITZ, JJ., join dissenting from denial of Petition for Rehearing En Banc:</p>\n<p id=\"b459-23\">I must dissent from the failure of the court to rehear this case en bane.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-25\">Without full court action, one panel has reached a desirable result; it has done so in defiance of a prior panel holding; and our court now has, outstanding, one case holding that costs awarded in litigated cases <em>do not bear interest, Carpa, Inc. v. Ward\u2019s Foods, Inc., </em>5th Cir., 567 F.2d 1316, and this case holding that all costs (including attorneys\u2019 fees) <em>do bear interest. </em>Each case appears to state the law of the Fifth Circuit on this important issue. District judges and counsel may, presumably, take their pick according to their inclinations and advocacy aims in cases yet to arise.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-26\">This should not have come about. A brief review of how it came about may be appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-27\">On May 14, 1980, the court, acting through a panel, decided <em>Gates v. Collier, </em>5th Cir., 616 F.2d 1268. In that opinion, two judges held that, while interest <em>could not be awarded </em>on \u201cout of pocket\u201d costs, that part of costs consisting of attorneys\u2019 fees should bear interest. The majority recognized, then, that to authorize an award of interest on attorneys\u2019 fees (defined as costs) they had to be split off from other costs, because \u201c... the view that out-of-pocket costs ... do not bear interest appears firmly established in our jurisprudence .... \u201d citing, inter alia, <em>Carpa (Gates </em>v. <em>Collier, </em>5th Cir., 616 F.2d at 1279, n.17).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-28\">I respectfully dissented. I felt then that we could not, and ought not, distinguish between \u201cout of pocket\u201d costs and those represented by attorneys\u2019 fees. I said, \u201cI wholeheartedly join with the majority in the feeling that the law ought to permit these plaintiffs to recover interest on the attorneys\u2019 fees awarded so long ago .... \u201d 616 F.2d at 1280. Indeed, I felt that <em>all costs </em>should bear interest, observing, \u201cWere I not of the opinion that <em>Carpa </em>prevents us from allowing interest on any part of costs, I would not hesitate to hold that these plaintiffs should have interest on their out-of-pocket costs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1282-83. Finally, I wrote, \u201cThe issue of interest on costs should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>be presented to the entire court on a proposal that it be considered <em>en banc.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">At that point, all on the panel agreed that interest could not be awarded on costs qua costs. The majority had held that, only because attorneys\u2019 fees could be severed from other costs and treated separately, interest could be awarded on that portion of costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">Then, on January 7, 1981, the panel majority produced an opinion on rehearing before the panel. It receded from the view that costs represented by attorneys\u2019 fees could be severed from other costs. \u201cThe majority ... is now convinced that it was in error in distinguishing between so-called out of pocket costs, on the one hand, and attorneys fees on the other.\u201d <em>Gates v. Collier, </em>636 F.2d 942 (5th Cir., 1981). Then, ignoring its earlier observation that it is firmly established in our jurisdiction that out-of-pocket costs do not bear interest, it concludes that, Carpa to the contrary notwithstanding, all costs now bear interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">Then, the court voted not to take the case en <em>banc! </em>Thus the entire court has declined to consider overruling <em>Carpa </em>and has declined to rehear this case, leaving both as the conflicting law of the Fifth Circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">So much for <em>stare decisis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b460-9\">I dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
