Cannon, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b374-17\">{\u00b6 1} Appellant, Kim Garland, appeals the judgment entered by the Trumbull County Court of Common Pleas. The trial court granted a motion for summary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>judgment filed by appellees, James David Brodell, M.D., and James David Brodell, M.D., Inc. (we will refer to appellees collectively as \u201cDr. Brodell\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">{\u00b6 2} Garland worked at Seven Seventeen Credit Union, Inc. (\u201cSeven Seventeen\u201d) for approximately 15 years. In 2005, Garland was a teleservices representative. This position involved assisting customers with various problems and processing loan applications over the telephone.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">{\u00b6 3} On April 24, 2005, Garland fell at her mother\u2019s house and hit her right elbow on the tile floor. She went to St. Joseph\u2019s Urgent Care, where she was diagnosed with a broken elbow. The urgent-care physician advised her to follow up with a family physician.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">{\u00b6 4} Garland followed up with Dr. Brodell.. Dr. Brodell confirmed that Garland\u2019s right elbow was broken, diagnosing her with a radial head fracture. Dr. Brodell told Garland to keep her right arm in a sling. Dr. Brodell gave Garland an \u201coff-work\u201d slip indicating that she was to be off work for two months.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">{\u00b6 5} Garland turned the off-work slip into Seven Seventeen. Seven Seventeen requested that Garland fill out a form for leave pursuant to the Family Medical Leave Act (\u201cFMLA\u201d). The form was sent to Dr. Brodell. Dr. Brodell completed certain portions of the form, advising that Garland was to be off work until June 27, 2005. The form was forwarded to Seven Seventeen. After receiving the FMLA form, Seven Seventeen sent a letter to Dr. Brodell, asking whether Garland could return to work on May 9, 2005, if her job duties were modified. Dr. Brodell responded to the letter with a handwritten notation that Garland could return to work on May 9, 2005, on the condition that she not use her right arm.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">{\u00b6 6} Garland returned to work on May 10, 2005. Her revised job duties were to file, alphabetize letters, and proofread forms. On May 12, 2005, while at work, Garland bumped her injured elbow on a file cabinet. She went to St. Joseph\u2019s emergency room. The doctors there evaluated Garland and determined that there was no further damage to her elbow.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-9\">{\u00b6 7} After this second incident, Garland followed up with Dr. Tom Jones on May 18, 2005. Garland continued to work in her revised job duties after bumping her elbow at work until her initial appointment with Dr. Jones. Dr. Jones provided Garland with an off-work slip, and she did not work for several weeks after seeing Dr. Jones. About three or four weeks after her initial appointment with Dr. Jones, Garland was no longer required to use the sling. Thereafter, she returned to her regular job at Seven Seventeen, in the same capacity as before her injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-10\">{\u00b6 8} Garland filed a complaint for disclosure of confidential information against Dr. Brodell and Seven Seventeen. Garland claimed that she did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>authorize Dr. Brodell to respond to the follow-up letter from Seven Seventeen. Both Seven Seventeen and Dr. Brodell filed answers to Garland\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">{\u00b6 9} Dr. Brodell filed a motion for summary judgment. Dr. Brodell attached several items to his motion, including a copy of the FMLA form he completed on behalf of Garland and a copy of his response to the inquiry from Seven Seventeen about Garland returning to work on May 9, 2005. Garland filed a brief in opposition to Dr. Brodell\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Among other items, Garland attached a copy of Dr. Brodell\u2019s answers to her first set of interrogatories, requests for admissions, and requests for production of documents. Dr. Brodell filed a reply to Garland\u2019s brief in opposition to his motion for summary judgment. In addition to the documents attached to the parties\u2019 submissions, the depositions of Garland, Dr. Brodell, and one of Dr. Brodell\u2019s employees, Karen Palmer, were filed for the trial court\u2019s consideration. The trial court granted Dr. Brodell\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">{\u00b6 10} Garland\u2019s claims against Seven Seventeen were dismissed pursuant to a stipulated dismissal entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">{\u00b6 11} Garland raises the following assignment of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cThe trial court erred to the prejudice of appellant in granting appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b376-9\">{\u00b6 13} In order for a motion for summary judgment to be granted, the moving party must demonstrate:</p>\n<p id=\"b376-10\">{\u00b6 14} \u201c(1) [N]o genuine issue as to any material fact remains to be litigated, (2) the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and (3) it appears from the evidence that reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion, and viewing such evidence most strongly in favor of the nonmoving party, that conclusion is adverse to the party against whom the motion for summary judgment is made.\u201d <em>Mootispaw v. Eckstein </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 383, 385, 667 N.E.2d 1197.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-11\">{\u00b6 15} Summary judgment will be granted if \u201cthe pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, written admissions, affidavits, transcripts of evidence, and written stipulations of facts, if any, * * * show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact * * *.\" Civ.R. 56(C). Material facts are those that might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law of the case. <em>Turner v. Turner </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 337, 340, 617 N.E.2d 1123, quoting <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc. </em>(1986), 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-12\">{\u00b6 16} If the moving party meets this burden, the nonmoving party must then provide evidence illustrating a genuine issue of material fact, pursuant to Civ.R. 56(E). <em>Dresher v. Burt </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 280, 293, 662 N.E.2d 264. Civ.R. 56(E) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>{\u00b6 17} \u201cWhen a motion for summary judgment is made and supported as provided in this rule, an adverse party may not rest upon the mere allegations or denials of the adverse party\u2019s pleadings, but the adverse party\u2019s response, by affidavits or as otherwise provided in this rule, must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial. If the party does not so respond, summary judgment, if appropriate, shall be entered against the party.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">{\u00b6 18} Summary judgment is appropriate, pursuant to Civ.R. 56(E), if the nonmoving party does not meet this burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">{\u00b6 19} Appellate courts review a trial court\u2019s entry of summary judgment de novo. <em>Brown v. Scioto Cty. Bd. of Commrs. </em>(1993), 87 Ohio App.3d 704, 711, 622 N.E.2d 1153. <em>\u201cDe novo </em>review means that this court uses the same standard that the trial court should have used, and we examine the evidence to determine whether as a matter of law no genuine issues exist for trial.\u201d <em>Brewer v. Cleveland Bd. of Edn. </em>(1997), 122 Ohio App.3d 378, 383, 701 N.E.2d 1023, citing <em>Dupler v. Mansfield Journal </em>(1980), 64 Ohio St.2d 116, 119-120, 18 O.O.3d 354, 413 N.E.2d 1187.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">{\u00b6 20} \u201cIn Ohio, an independent tort exists for the unauthorized, unprivileged disclosure to a third party of nonpublic medical information that a physician or hospital has learned within a physician-patient relationship.\u201d <em>Biddle v. Warren Gen. Hosp. </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 395, 715 N.E.2d 518, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">{\u00b6 21} Garland claims that Dr. Brodell\u2019s response to Seven Seventeen\u2019s inquiry about whether she could return to work at an earlier date with revised job duties constitutes an unauthorized release of her medical information. Dr. Brodell claims that he was operating under Garland\u2019s consent when he replied to Seven Seventeen\u2019s inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-9\">{\u00b6 22} During Garland\u2019s deposition, the following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<p id=\"b377-10\">{\u00b6 23} \u201cQ. Did you understand that by asking for time off work and by providing this form to Dr. Brodell, that he was going to fill it out and give it back to your employer?</p>\n<p id=\"b377-11\">{\u00b6 24} \u201cA. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-12\">{\u00b6 25} \u201cQ. Did you understand that he was going to be telling your employer the diagnosis for your injury?</p>\n<p id=\"b377-13\">{\u00b6 26} \u201cA. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-14\">{\u00b6 27} \u201cQ. Did you understand that he was going to be giving your employer an opinion as to how long you would have to be off work?</p>\n<p id=\"b377-15\">{\u00b6 28} \u201cA. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>{\u00b6 29} \u201cQ. That\u2019s the whole point of the form, isn\u2019t it?</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">{\u00b6 30} \u201cA. Yes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">{\u00b6 31} Garland acknowledged that she authorized Dr. Brodell to provide her diagnosis and anticipated return date to Seven Seventeen. However, she claims that her original consent terminated when Dr. Brodell submitted the original version of the FMLA form to Seven Seventeen. Thus, she contends, Dr. Brodell did not have her consent to respond to Seven Seventeen\u2019s inquiry about whether Garland would be permitted to perform alternative job assignments. In fact, Garland claims that Seven Seventeen had already accepted the certification from the doctor and approved the leave. However, the FMLA form was signed on April 27, 2005. The employer\u2019s letter in response was sent May 3, 2005. There is nothing whatsoever in the record to reflect that this certification had been \u201caccepted\u201d and the leave approved. In fact, the timing of the letter in response suggests that the leave had not been approved.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">{\u00b6 32} The trial court concluded that Dr. Brodell was acting under the continued authorization of Garland when he responded to Seven Seventeen\u2019s follow-up inquiry about revised job duties. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">{\u00b6 33} In support of her position, Garland cites <em>Hageman v. Southwest Gen. Health Ctr., </em>8th Dist. No. 87826, 2006-Ohio-6765, 2006 WL 3743095. In <em>Hageman, </em>the appellant was involved in a domestic-relations action with his ex-wife. Id. at \u00b6 7. While that action was pending, an altercation occurred between the appellant and his ex-wife, which resulted in criminal charges being filed against the appellant. Id. at \u00b6 8. During this time, the appellant was seeing a psychiatrist. Id. at \u00b6 10. The appellant consented to his medical records being disclosed to the domestic-relations court as part of his effort to obtain custody of his minor child. Id. at \u00b6 27. However, his ex-wife\u2019s attorney turned those records over to the prosecutor in the criminal matter. Id. at \u00b6 30. In reversing in part an order of summary judgment, the Eighth Appellate District held that appellant\u2019s waiver of his privilege of confidentiality of his medical records in relation to the domestic-relations matter did not transform into a waiver for the purposes of his criminal matter. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">{\u00b6 34} Garland argues that the <em>Hageman </em>holding applies to the case sub judice. We disagree. In <em>Hageman, </em>the Eighth District held that an authorization of release of one\u2019s medical records is limited to the single entity to which the patient authorized disclosure. Id. In the case at bar, Garland authorized Dr. Brodell to disclose portions of her medical record to Seven Seventeen for the purposes of obtaining leave pursuant to the FMLA. Dr. Brodell\u2019s follow-up comments were not directed to an unauthorized third party; instead, they were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>directed to Seven Seventeen, whom Garland had specifically authorized to receive her medical information.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">{\u00b6 35} Next, Garland argues that Seven Seventeen needed additional authorization if it sought a \u201csecond opinion\u201d regarding her medical condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">{\u00b6 36} Garland cites <em>Harcourt v. Cincinnati Bell Tel. Co. </em>(S.D.Ohio 2005), 383 F.Supp.2d 944, in support of her argument. In <em>Harcourt, </em>the court analyzed the implications of Section 2613, Title 29, U.S.Code, which sets forth certification requirements under the FMLA. Id. at 955. This section provides a mechanism for an employer to request a second medical opinion if it doubts the \u201cvalidity\u201d of the physician\u2019s certification. Id. at 955. The patient\u2019s consent is necessary prior to obtaining a second opinion. Id. Garland argues that Seven Seventeen was effectively questioning the validity of Dr. Brodell\u2019s FMLA certification in this case and, as such, it was required to obtain her consent for a second opinion. We disagree. Seven Seventeen was not questioning the underlying diagnosis of Dr. Brodell; it merely questioned whether Garland was capable of performing alternative work with her injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">{\u00b6 37} In reaching a similar conclusion, the trial court characterized Dr. Brodell\u2019s response to Seven Seventeen\u2019s letter as \u201cmerely a clarification\u201d of his prior diagnosis. On appeal, Garland focuses on the trial court\u2019s use of the term \u201cclarification.\u201d Garland notes that the <em>Harcourt </em>court also analyzed Section 825.307, Title 29, C.F.R,., which provides that an employer \u201c \u2018may contact the employee\u2019s health care provider, with the employee\u2019s permission, for purposes of clarification\u2019 \u201d of an FMLA certification. <em>Harcourt v. Cincinnati Bell Tel. Co., </em>383 F.Supp.2d at 955, quoting Section 825.307, Title 29, C.F.R. It seems clear that the focus of that court\u2019s concern was when the employer was questioning the <em>authenticity </em>of a certification. Id. at 955. Upon review of the trial court\u2019s judgment entry, it does not appear that the trial court intended to use the term \u201cclarification\u201d as that term is technically referenced in the Code of Federal Regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-8\">{\u00b6 38} Moreover, it is important to note that the clarification provision in the Code of Federal Regulations applies after the physician has submitted a <em>complete </em>certification under the FMLA. <em>Harcourt v. Cincinnati Bell Tel. Co., </em>383 F.Supp.2d at 955, quoting Section 825.307(a), Title 29, C.F.R. Dr. Brodell argues that the original FMLA form was not entirely completed when he initially returned it to Seven Seventeen. Specifically, there was no response given to the question asked at line 7b of the form, which was:</p>\n<p id=\"b379-9\">{\u00b6 39} \u201cIf able to perform some work, is the employee unable to perform any one or more of the essential functions of the employee\u2019s job (the employee or employer should supply you with information about the essential job functions)? <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>If yes, please list the essential functions the employee is unable to perform.\u201d (Emphasis omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">{\u00b6 40} In its follow-up letter to Dr. Brodell, Seven Seventeen stated that it realized Garland would be unable to perform the duties of her regular job, as those duties required a significant amount of data entry. However, Seven Seventeen asked Dr. Brodell whether Garland would be able to perform the following alternative tasks: (1) stuffing envelopes, (2) alphabetizing documents, and (3) proofreading forms. Dr. Brodell generally responded to Seven Seventeen\u2019s inquiry with the comment: \u201cNo use of [right] arm/hand. If job meets that restriction then may return 5-9-05.\u201d Essentially, this subsequent communication from Dr. Brodell answered the original inquiry contained in section 7b of the FMLA form. Dr. Brodell was advising Seven Seventeen of the potential job functions that Garland would be unable to perform, i.e., those that required use of her right hand and/or arm.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">{\u00b6 41} In this matter, Seven Seventeen was not challenging the validity of Dr. Brodell\u2019s diagnosis, nor was it seeking a formal clarification as anticipated by Section 825.307(a), Title 29, C.F.R. Instead, due to Dr. Brodell\u2019s initial failure to complete section 7b of the FMLA form, Seven Seventeen was simply seeking an explanation as to whether Garland was able to perform revised job assignments with her injury. Accordingly, Garland\u2019s arguments raised in reliance on <em>Harcourt v. Cincinnati Bell Tel. Co., </em>383 F.Supp.2d 944, are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">{\u00b6 42} Garland cites the depositions of Dr. Brodell and Palmer and argues that the privacy practices in Dr. Brodell\u2019s office were insufficient. We have determined that Dr. Brodell acted under the continuing authority of Garland when he responded to Seven Seventeen\u2019s subsequent inquiry and, therefore, he did not make an unauthorized disclosure of her medical information. Thus, the general privacy practices of Dr. Brodell\u2019s office are not relevant to this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">{\u00b6 43} Dr. Brodell argues that his subsequent response to Seven Seventeen did not disclose any confidential medical information. Since we have concluded that Dr. Brodell acted under the continuing authority of Garland, we need not determine whether his response constituted confidential medical information.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-9\">{\u00b6 44} There was no genuine issue of material fact, and Dr. Brodell was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Therefore, the trial court did not err in granting Dr. Brodell\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-10\">{\u00b6 45} Garland\u2019s assignment of error is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-11\">{\u00b6 46} The judgment of the Trumbull County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-12\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b381-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>Rice, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b381-4\">O\u2019Toole, J., dissents.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b381-5\">Colleen Mary O\u2019Toole, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"ASY\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">{\u00b6 47} Finding that summary judgment was improvidently granted in this case, I would reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">{\u00b6 48} The majority premises its decision on the fact that Dr. Brodell did not fill out item 7.b. on the certification for medical leave presented to him, leading the majority to conclude that the form was not \u201ccomplete.\u201d I agree with the majority that pursuant to Section 825.307(a), Title 29, C.F.R., the nondisclosure provisions of the FMLA do not initiate until an employee submits to his or her employer a complete certification from a health-care provider. Thus, the question presented is whether the certification as filled out initially by Dr. Brodell was \u201ccomplete.\u201d I think it was.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">{\u00b6 49} Section 2613, Title 29, U.S.Code provides as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b381-9\">{\u00b6 50} \u201c(b) Sufficient certification. Certification provided under subsection (a) shall be sufficient if it states\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b381-10\">{\u00b6 51} \u201c(1) the date on which the serious health condition commenced;</p>\n<p id=\"b381-11\">{\u00b6 52} \u201c(2) the probable duration of the condition;</p>\n<p id=\"b381-12\">{\u00b6 53} \u201c(3) the appropriate medical facts within the knowledge of the health care provider regarding the condition;</p>\n<p id=\"b381-13\">{\u00b6 54} \u201c(4)(A) * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b381-14\">{\u00b6 55} \u201c(B) for purposes of leave under [Section 2612(a)(1)(D), Title 29, U.S.Code], <em>a statement that the employee is unable to perform the functions of the position of the employee </em>* * (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b381-15\">{\u00b6 56} These statutory requirements are substantially tracked by Section 825.306(a), Title 29, C.F.R., controlling the content of medical certifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-16\">{\u00b6 57} The information required for a \u201csufficient\u201d certification pursuant to Section 2613(b)(1) through (3), Title 29, U.S.Code, is provided for at various points in the certification submitted to and filled out by Dr. Brodell. The information required by Section 2613(b)(4)(B) (i.e., that the employee\u2019s health condition prevents them from working) is to be answered by the health-care provider at item 7. That provides, in toto:</p>\n<p id=\"b381-17\">{\u00b6 58} \u201c7. a. If medical leave is required for the employee\u2019s absence from work because of the employee\u2019s own health condition (including absences due to pregnancy or a chronic condition), is the employee unable to perform work of any kind?</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>{\u00b6 59} \u201cb. If able to perform some work, is the employee unable to perform any one or more of the essential functions of the employee\u2019s job (the employee or the employer should supply you with information about the essential job functions)? If yes, please list the essential functions the employee is unable to perform:</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">{\u00b6 60} \u201cc. If neither a. nor b. applies, is it necessary for the employee to be absent from work for treatment?\u201d (Boldface sic.)</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">{\u00b6 61} In this case, Dr. Brodell filled out <em>both </em>items 7.a. and 7.c. with the phrase, \u201coff work 4-25-05 to 6-27-05,\u201d leaving 7.b. blank. That is, he indicated that Garland could not perform her functions as an employee, Section 2613(b)(4)(B), Title 29, U.S.Code, and that she required treatment for her condition. This information made the certification complete and sufficient for purposes of the statute. Admittedly, the answer given by Dr. Brodell to item 7. might very well be confusing to Garland\u2019s employer, Seven Seventeen Credit Union, since he filled out two sections in what are meant to be mutually exclusive answers. Nevertheless, if Seven Seventeen wished for clarification of Dr. Bro-dell\u2019s opinion, it was required to get Garland\u2019s further authorization prior to contacting the doctor. It did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">{\u00b6 62} Consequently, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
