McMonagle, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b581-11\">{\u00b6 1} This appeal and cross-appeal concern the apportionment and distribution' of a $1,000,000 wrongful-death settlement and attorney fees made by the probate court. Appellant, Harriet Bryson, appeals from the probate court\u2019s judgment granting in part and denying in part objections to the distribution and award of attorney fees filed by Aaron Mason (\u201cMason\u201d) and Sierra Mason (\u201cSierra\u201d). Mason and Sierra cross-appeal. For the reasons that follow, we affirm in part and reverse and remand in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-12\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b581-13\">{\u00b6 2} On August 27, 2002, Bryson\u2019s 16-year-old son, Ricardo Mason, was shot in the back and killed by two Cleveland police officers as he sat in the front passenger seat of a car driven by another youth.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>{\u00b6 3} In March 2003, Bryson filed an application with the probate court to be appointed administrator of the estate of Ricardo Mason. In the application, she listed Aaron Mason as the father of the decedent and indicated that his address was unknown. She gave notice of her application by publication, and after the requisite time, the probate court ruled that publication was complete, and there had been \u201cno appearance by father.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">{\u00b6 4} Thereafter, in August 2003, Bryson filed suit against two police officers and the city of Cleveland in federal court. The complaint alleged claims based upon violation of decedent\u2019s rights under Section 1983, Title 42, U.S.Code and wrongful-death, assault-and-battery, intentional-infliction-of-emotional-distress, and spoliation-of-evidence claims under state law. Bryson brought the action \u201cfor the exclusive benefit of the next of kin of decedent,\u201d although she did not specifically name Mason or Sierra as next of kin in the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">{\u00b6 5} Prosecution of the federal case took nearly five years; the case was finally settled during jury selection on the first day of trial on February 8, 2008. In light of their prodigious efforts on Bryson\u2019s behalf and their contingency-fee agreement with her, Bryson\u2019s attorneys filed an application for approval of contingency fees of 40 percent with the probate court after the case was settled.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">{\u00b6 6} Likewise, Bryson filed an application with the probate court pursuant to R.C. 2125.03 to approve the settlement and distribution of the wrongful-death claim monies. She proposed that the net settlement proceeds of $421,580.74 remaining after payment of attorney fees and expenses be distributed as follows: $299,080.74 to Bryson (decedent\u2019s mother); $70,000 to Tierra Mason (decedent\u2019s sister); $50,000 to Aaron R. Mason (decedent\u2019s brother); and $2,500 to Kathleen Bolton (decedent\u2019s maternal grandmother).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-8\">{\u00b6 7} Mason, who had had no contact of any kind with the decedent after 1993 and had made no appearance until after the wrongful-death action was settled, and Sierra, decedent\u2019s half-sister who had had no relationship whatsoever with decedent, objected to the proposed distribution and payment of attorney fees. They also filed motions to disqualify Bryson\u2019s counsel and to remove Bryson as administrator, which the magistrate denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-9\">{\u00b6 8} The magistrate held a hearing on the application for fees and on Bryson\u2019s application for approval of the settlement and distribution of settlement proceeds on June 26 and July 3, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-10\">A. Evidence Adduced at the Hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b582-11\">{\u00b6 9} Bryson testified that she and Mason had started living together in 1986. They eventually had three children \u2014 Ricardo, Tierra, and Aaron \u2014 and she was solely responsible for providing for and caring for them. Mason contributed little <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>financially, as he worked only sporadically until 1988, when he stopped working altogether. The couple separated \u201cby agreement\u201d in 1991 because of Mason\u2019s drug use, when the decedent was five years old. Bryson testified that her relationship with Mason had ended after the separation and that Mason had contributed nothing financially for the children after the separation.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">{\u00b6 10} Mason began living with Shirelle Palmer in 1991; their daughter, Sierra, was born on December 13, 1992. Palmer lived with Mason until 1993. The decedent visited Mason on a few occasions during this time, but never saw him after 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">{\u00b6 11} Palmer testified that she noted deterioration in Mason\u2019s appearance and behavior during their cohabitation. She testified that he often talked to himself and babbled and that he told her he heard voices. At times, he would leave home for several days. After their separation, Palmer sometimes saw Mason on the streets, dressed in floppy hats and army fatigue pants, with a skirt around the pants.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">{\u00b6 12} Palmer testified that she saw Bryson once when Sierra was about four or five years old. They talked about getting Bryson\u2019s children and Sierra together for a visit and exchanged telephone numbers, but Palmer admitted that she never followed up to arrange a visit. Palmer saw Bryson again in 2005, after decedent\u2019s death, and they again talked about the children getting together, but it never happened. Palmer testified that neither she nor Sierra went to decedent\u2019s funeral, although they knew of decedent\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-8\">{\u00b6 13} Sierra Mason testified that she was nine years old when decedent died and was \u201csad\u201d upon learning of his death. Sierra testified that she had asked Palmer about visiting her half-siblings, but admitted that she never did. Sierra admitted that she had never had any relationship with decedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-9\">{\u00b6 14} Bryson learned about her son\u2019s death after receiving a telephone call from the hospital informing her that he had been in an accident. She called her mother from the hospital, and Bolton joined her there, along with other family members. Bryson testified that she did not inform Mason of decedent\u2019s death because she did not know where he lived or the whereabouts of any member of the Mason family. No one from the Mason family attended the funeral. Bryson testified extensively regarding her grief in losing a child. Likewise, Bolton testified about the events surrounding decedent\u2019s death and her grief in losing her grandson.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-10\">{\u00b6 15} Tierra Mason testified that she had a \u201cclose\u201d relationship with the decedent and that she was \u201churt, sad\u201d and in disbelief when she learned of his death. She testified that his death had a lasting impact on her, and now, she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>\u201ckeeps things inside\u201d and \u201cis more to herself.\u201d Tierra testified that she last saw Mason when she was four or five years old.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">{\u00b6 16} Mason testified that he had been homeless, living on the streets and in shelters, for many years. He admitted that he had had no contact with decedent after 1993 and offered no testimony regarding any loss he suffered as a result of decedent\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">{\u00b6 17} Rodney Frank, a longtime friend of Mason\u2019s, testified that he and Mason used to drink alcohol and use marijuana together on numerous occasions. He testified that Mason\u2019s behavior and appearance deteriorated in the early 1990s. He testified that after 1993, he would see Mason on the streets, inappropriately dressed, unkempt, and unable to engage in meaningful conversation, but denying the need for medical attention. Frank testified that Mason never talked to him about his children during these years.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">{\u00b6 18} Michael Taylor, another longtime friend of Mason\u2019s, likewise testified that Mason\u2019s behavior and appearance deteriorated in the early 1990s. Taylor saw Mason on the streets and would talk to him. When he told Mason of decedent\u2019s death, Mason stated, \u201cIt\u2019s not true; my son is not dead.\u201d Mason and Taylor talked about going to the funeral, but did not do so due to Mason\u2019s lack of appropriate clothing. Taylor testified that during Mason\u2019s years on the streets, Mason never talked to Taylor about his family, including decedent, and never asked Taylor to contact Bryson on his behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-8\">{\u00b6 19} Daniel Wutch, a social worker at Safe Haven, testified that Mason had been living there since 2007. After a mental-health assessment in June 2007, Mason was diagnosed with schizophrenia, paranoid type, and was prescribed medication. Wutch testified that Mason is noncompliant with his medication regimen and continues to deny having a mental illness. Mason\u2019s medical records were admitted into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-9\">{\u00b6 20} Forensic and clinical psychologist Dr. John Fabian evaluated Mason\u2019s ability to understand the nature and objectives of the court proceedings and his ability to assist his attorneys in the process. His written report was admitted into evidence. Dr. Fabian testified that he agreed that Mason has schizophrenia, but found him capable of understanding the legal proceedings and able to assist his attorneys.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-10\">B. The Magistrate\u2019s Decision; The Trial Court\u2019s Subsequent Ruling</p>\n<p id=\"b584-11\">{\u00b6 21} In her written decision, which was filed on August 5, 2008, the magistrate first noted that as there was no objection to the settlement amount, the court had bifurcated the proceedings and approved the settlement of $1,000,000 and payment of expenses in the amount of $178,419.26.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>{\u00b6 22} With respect to the application for attorney fees of 40 percent, or $400,000, the magistrate found that Loc.R. 71.2 of the Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court, Probate Division, allows fees in excess of the schedule of allowable fees if the court is satisfied that counsel rendered \u201cextraordinary services.\u201d The magistrate found that Bryson\u2019s counsel had rendered such extraordinary services in the wrongful-death action and that their services warranted approval of a higher fee. She found that fees in the amount of $303,333.33 had previously been distributed and ordered that the remaining sum of $96,666.67 be paid from the settlement proceeds as the balance of attorney fees due.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">{\u00b6 23} The magistrate then addressed distribution of the $421,580.74 net proceeds remaining after payment of attorney fees and case expenses. Throughout her decision, the magistrate always referred to Mason, decedent\u2019s father, as \u201cAaron Mason\u201d or \u201cMr. Mason\u201d and to decedent\u2019s brother as \u201cAaron R. Mason\u201d and once as \u201cAaron Ricardo Mason.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> She listed the potential statutory beneficiaries and their relationship to the decedent as follows: \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">Harriet Bryson, Mother</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">Tierra Mason, Sister</p>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">Aaron R. Mason, Brother</p>\n<p id=\"b585-9\">Kathleen Bolton, Maternal Grandmother</p>\n<p id=\"b585-10\">Aaron Mason, Father</p>\n<p id=\"b585-11\">Sierra Mason, Half-Sister</p>\n<p id=\"b585-12\">{\u00b6 24} After analyzing the evidence and applicable law, the magistrate ordered that the net settlement proceeds be distributed as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b585-13\">Harriet Bryson (77.5%) $326,740.74</p>\n<p id=\"b585-14\">Tierra Mason (12%) $ 50,590.00</p>\n<p id=\"b585-15\">Kathleen Bolton (.5%) $ 2,100.00</p>\n<p id=\"b585-16\">Aaron Ricardo Mason (10%) $ 42,150.00</p>\n<p id=\"b585-17\">Sierra Mason (0%) $ 0.00</p>\n<p id=\"b585-18\">Aaron Mason (0%) $ 0.00</p>\n<p id=\"b585-19\">{\u00b6 25} On August 14, 2008, Mason and Sierra filed a motion for an extension of time until September 3, 2008, to file the record. The trial court apparently granted the motion the same day. On August 25, 2008, Bryson filed a motion for immediate entry of judgment on the magistrate\u2019s decision. She argued that because Mason and Sierra had not filed timely objections under Civ.R. 53(D)(3)(b)\u00ae to the magistrate\u2019s decision, the court should proceed to judgment. The court subsequently denied Bryson\u2019s motion and found that its order granting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>Mason and Sierra\u2019s motion for an extension of time to file the record was intended to grant them until September 3, 2008, to file their objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">{\u00b6 26} Mason and Sierra filed their objections and a transcript of the hearing on August 29, 2008. In their objections, they argued that the magistrate had erred in awarding Mason only $42,150 and in awarding Sierra nothing. They argued that they should be awarded more and that the distributions to Bryson, Tierra Mason, and Bolton should be reduced. They also argued that the magistrate had erred in (1) denying their motions to disqualify Bryson\u2019s counsel and to remove Bryson as administrator of the estate, (2) limiting the scope of Bryson\u2019s and Tierra Mason\u2019s depositions, and (3) approving extraordinary attorney fees of 40 percent. The trial court set a hearing on the objections. Prior to the hearing, Bryson filed a prehearing brief in which she noted that contrary to the claim made by Aaron Mason and Sierra in their objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision, the magistrate had awarded decedent\u2019s brother $42,150 and had awarded Mason nothing. Bryson asked the court to confirm the magistrate\u2019s decision, but to include the relationship of each beneficiary to the decedent in the decision to clarify that $42,150 was to be distributed to decedent\u2019s brother.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">{\u00b6 27} The trial court subsequently granted Aaron Mason and Sierra\u2019s objections in part and denied them in part. The court found that although Bryson\u2019s counsel were \u201cskilled advocates\u201d in the case, they had not performed \u201cextraordinary services\u201d sufficient to permit a fee award in excess of the schedule of allowable fees set forth in Loc.R. 71.2. Accordingly, the trial court ordered that counsel\u2019s fees be reduced to $303,333.33, which had already been paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">(\u00b6 28} The trial court found that Bryson had incorrectly interpreted the magistrate\u2019s decision as awarding $42,150 to decedent\u2019s brother, and the decision actually awarded the monies to Mason. The court further found that the magistrate had erred in awarding Mason $42,150 and Sierra nothing and ordered that the distribution to Mason be increased to $51,824.76 and that $1,295.13 be distributed to Sierra. The court found that the magistrate had properly distributed nothing to decedent\u2019s brother, but ordered that the distributions to Bryson, Tierra Mason, and Kathleen Bolton be increased to $400,346.38, $61,189.73, and $2,591.74 respectively. (The increased distributions totaled $96,666.67, the difference between the amount of attorney fees requested ($400,000) and the amount awarded by the court ($303,333.33)).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-8\">{\u00b6 29} The court denied Mason and Sierra\u2019s request to reduce the distributions to Bryson, Tierra Mason, and Bolton. It also overruled their objections to the magistrate\u2019s denial of their motions to disqualify counsel and remove Bryson as administrator because it found \u201cno evidence justifying the removal of Harriet Bryson as Administratrix of the Estate or evidence of conflict of interest or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>impropriety that would disqualify counsel in the wrongful death litigation from acting as counsel for the Estate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">{\u00b6 30} Bryson appeals from the trial court\u2019s judgment; Mason and Sierra cross-appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">II. Bryson\u2019s Assignments of Error</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">A. Motion for Immediate Judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b587-8\">{\u00b6 31} In her first assignment of error, Bryson argues that the trial court erred in denying her motion for immediate judgment on the magistrate\u2019s decision and granting a hearing on objections that were not timely filed under Civ.R. 53(D)(3)(b)\u00ae.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-9\">{\u00b6 32} Under Civ.R. 53(D)(3)(b)\u00ae, a party may file written objections to a magistrate\u2019s decision within 14 days of the filing of the decision. Under Civ.R. 53(D)(3)(b)(iii), a party shall file the transcript with the court within 30 days after filing objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-10\">{\u00b6 33} Bryson argues that Mason and Sierra\u2019s motion for an extension of time to file the <em>record </em>said nothing about an extension of time to file their written <em>objections, </em>and therefore, they should have filed their objections by August 19, 2008, 14 days after the magistrate\u2019s decision was filed. Bryson contends that because they did not do so, the trial court should have granted her motion to proceed to immediate judgment on the magistrate\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-11\"> {\u00b6 34} Under Civ.R. 53(D)(5), a court shall allow a reasonable extension of time to file objections for good cause shown. Likewise, under Civ.R. 6(B), a court may in its discretion enlarge the period in which objections must be filed. <em>Provident Bank v. Hartman </em>(May 24, 2001), Cuyahoga App. No. 78292, 2001 WL 605404; <em>Kaur v. Bharmota, </em>Franklin App. No. 05AP-1333, 2006-Ohio-5782, 2006 WL 3113376. An abuse of discretion means that the court acted arbitrarily, unreasonably, or unlawfully in granting the extension. <em>Blakemore v. Blakemore </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 5 OBR 481, 450 N.E.2d 1140.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-12\">{\u00b6 35} In its entry denying Bryson\u2019s motion for immediate judgment, the trial court indicated that it had treated Mason and Sierra\u2019s motion for an extension of time to file the record as a request for an extension of time to file their objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision. We cannot say that this was an abuse of the trial court\u2019s discretion under Civ.R. 6(B). Although appellees\u2019 motion made no mention about filing objections, the trial court apparently concluded that without a record, appellees could not make their objections. Accordingly, Bryson\u2019s first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>B. Specificity of Objections</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">{\u00b6 36} Under Civ.R. 53(D)(3)(b), \u201can objection to a magistrate\u2019s decision shall be specific and state with particularity all grounds for objection.\u201d In her second assignment of error, Bryson contends that Mason and Sierra\u2019s objections to the magistrate\u2019s report lacked specificity and therefore should not have been considered by the trial court. She argues that although appellees filed a transcript of the hearing with their objections, they did not cite any specific page of the transcript to support their objections. Likewise, Bryson argues that although appellees included Mason\u2019s medical records with their objections, they did not cite any evidence in the records that would support a conclusion different from that reached by the magistrate.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">{\u00b6 37} We agree that appellees\u2019 written objections were less than stellar. They contained conclusory statements that \u201cthe record and evidence\u201d did not support the magistrate\u2019s decision, and despite appellees\u2019 assertion otherwise, made no references whatsoever to any page in the transcript or the medical records that would support them objections. Nevertheless, we find that the objections met the minimum standards for objections set forth in Civ.R. 53(D)(3). Appellees stated with adequate particularity the six grounds for their objections, made some argument regarding each, and filed the transcript with their objections, which was sufficient to allow the trial court to fulfill its duty under Civ.R. 53(D)(4)(d) to rule on the objections after an independent review. See <em>In re Tutt </em>(Aug. 31, 2000), Cuyahoga App. No. 77028, 2000 WL 1231477. Accordingly, Bryson\u2019s second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">C. Attorney Fees</p>\n<p id=\"b588-8\">{\u00b6 38} Local Rule 71.2 of the Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court, Probate Division, sets fees in cases where representation is on a contingency basis at 33 percent of the first $100,000 and 30 percent of the amount over $100,000, but allows for additional compensation \u201cif the applicant demonstrates and the court is satisfied that extraordinary services have been rendered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b588-9\">{\u00b6 39} In her written decision, the magistrate reviewed the prodigious efforts of Bryson\u2019s counsel over the nearly five years of litigation and concluded that they had rendered extraordinary services in achieving the $1,000,000 settlement. Appellees, who had no part in obtaining the settlement, objected to this award as excessive. The trial court agreed with appellees and found that counsel had not demonstrated \u201cextraordinary services\u201d sufficient to justify the increased award. The court modified the magistrate\u2019s decision and ordered attorney fees according to the schedule allowed by Loc.R. 71.2. In her third assignment of error, Bryson argues that the trial court erred in reducing the attorney-fees award.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>{\u00b6 40} The decision to adopt, reject, or modify a magistrate\u2019s report will not be reversed on appeal unless the decision was an abuse of discretion. <em>Tiffe v. Groenenstein, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 80668, 2003-Ohio-1335, 2003 WL 1353987, \u00b6 3, citing <em>Wade v. Wade </em>(1996), 113 Ohio App.3d 414, 419, 680 N.E.2d 1305. \u201cAbuse of discretion\u201d connotes more than an error of law or judgment; it implies that the court\u2019s attitude was unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable. <em>Blakemore v. Blakemore </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 5 OBR 481, 450 N.E.2d 1140. We find the trial court\u2019s decision regarding attorney fees to be unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">{\u00b6 41} Until the case was settled on the first day of trial after nearly five years of litigation, the police officers and the city contended that the deadly shooting was reasonable and justified. Bryson\u2019s counsel vigorously prosecuted the case, which, as the magistrate found in her decision, necessitated \u201c63 depositions; [a] reconstruction expert retained to prove defendants had altered, spoliated, and destroyed evidence at the scene; purchase of the vehicle [from the salvage yard] in which decedent was shot to preserve it for use at trial; [a] summary judgment motion regarding the spoliation claim; the retention of multiple experts, including experts in ballistics, police procedure, accident reconstruction, forensic photography, audio, tire imprint, physician, accountant; defense of several additional summary judgment motions [Bryson\u2019s brief in opposition to defendants\u2019 three summary judgment motions was 92 pages long with 106 exhibits]; numerous discovery disputes requiring court intervention ([the] federal court docket contains 443 entries); defense of defendants\u2019 appeal of summary judgment ruling to Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals; full-scale trial preparation, including subpoena of 27 witnesses; preparation to cross-examine all defense witnesses; [and] time records kept pursuant to statute allowing attorney fees to the prevailing party [indicating] counsel fees in excess of $900,000.00.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">{\u00b6 42} On this record, we find counsel\u2019s efforts sufficiently extraordinary to warrant contingency fees of 40 percent under Loc.R. 71.2. Accordingly, the trial court abused its discretion in modifying the magistrate\u2019s decision regarding attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">{\u00b6 43} Bryson\u2019s third assignment of error is sustained. The case is reversed and remanded with instructions to the trial court to award attorney fees of 40 percent to Bryson\u2019s counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-8\">D. Distribution to Mason</p>\n<p id=\"b589-9\">{\u00b6 44} Under R.C. 2125.02(A)(1), \u201ca civil action for wrongful death shall be brought for the exclusive benefit of the surviving spouse, the children, and the parents of the decedent, all of whom are rebuttably presumed to have suffered damages by reason of the wrongful death, and for the exclusive benefit of the other next of kin of the decedent.\u201d R.C. 2125.03 provides that the amount <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>received from the settlement shall be distributed to the beneficiaries and that the court shall adjust each share \u201cin a manner that is equitable, having due regard for the injury and loss to each beneficiary resulting from the death and for the age and condition of the beneficiaries.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">{\u00b6 45} In her fifth assignment of error, Bryson argues that the trial court should have modified the magistrate\u2019s decision to reflect that the magistrate intended that $42,150 be distributed to decedent\u2019s brother, and not to Mason, decedent\u2019s father. Conversely, in her fourth assignment of error, Bryson argues that if the magistrate did, in fact, order that $42,150 be distributed to Mason, the award was not supported by the evidence, as Mason presented no evidence of his loss. In her sixth assignment of error, Bryson contends that the trial court erred in awarding Mason any monies at all, as Mason had abandoned decedent nine years before his death. We address these assignments of error together, as they are related.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">{\u00b6 46} We agree with Bryson that the magistrate\u2019s decision ordered that $42,150 be distributed to decedent\u2019s brother and that no monies be distributed to Aaron Mason. As noted earlier, the decision consistently referred to decedent\u2019s father as \u201cAaron Mason\u201d or \u201cMr. Mason\u201d and to decedent\u2019s brother as \u201cAaron R. Mason\u201d and once as \u201cAaron Ricardo Mason.\u201d Thus, the magistrate\u2019s order that $42,150 of the settlement proceeds be distributed to \u201cAaron Ricardo Mason\u201d and \u201c$0.00\u201d be distributed to \u201cAaron Mason\u201d meant that decedent\u2019s father was to receive none of the settlement monies. The trial court erred in finding that the magistrate\u2019s decision awarded $42,150 to the father and nothing to decedent\u2019s brother.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">{\u00b6 47} Nevertheless, we find the trial court\u2019s finding to be harmless error. The magistrate\u2019s decision contained an inherent inconsistency that may have led to the trial court\u2019s erroneous conclusion. Under R.C. 2125.02, Bryson and Aaron Mason, as decedent\u2019s parents, are rebuttably presumed to have suffered damages by reason of decedent\u2019s wrongful death. Other next of kin do not enjoy this presumption and must prove actual damages in order to share in the settlement proceeds. <em>Ramage v. Cent. Ohio Emergency Serv., Inc. </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 97, 105, 592 N.E.2d 828; <em>Hooks v. Owen </em>(1998), 130 Ohio App.3d 38, 43, 719 N.E.2d 581.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>{\u00b6 48} The magistrate\u2019s decision found that although Aaron Mason was rebuttably presumed to have suffered loss, sufficient rebuttal evidence had been presented to demonstrate that his loss was minimal, especially as compared to Bryson\u2019s. The decision also found that decedent\u2019s brother, Aaron R. Mason, who was required to prove his actual loss, was incarcerated and \u201cpresented no evidence that he suffered any losses.\u201d Despite these conclusions, the decision inexplicably awarded decedent\u2019s brother $42,150 and Aaron Mason nothing.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">{\u00b6 49} But as decedent\u2019s brother presented no evidence of his loss, no monies could be distributed to him. Further, as Mason was rebuttably presumed to have suffered loss and the evidence failed to establish that his loss was nonexistent, he was entitled to some monies. Bryson\u2019s argument that Mason was not entitled to any monies at all because he presented no evidence of his loss is misplaced. As a parent, Mason was rebuttably presumed to have suffered loss. Thus, it was Bryson\u2019s burden to present evidence to rebut the presumption of Mason\u2019s loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">{\u00b6 50} We review the trial court\u2019s decision under an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Tiffe, </em>2003-Ohio-1335, 2003 WL 1353987, \u00b6 3. Although the trial court abused its discretion in increasing the amounts awarded to the beneficiaries by the amount it decreased the attorney fees, we find no abuse of discretion in an award to Mason of $42,150, the amount apparently originally intended by the magistrate. The evidence demonstrated that Mason had had at least some contact with his son until he was eight years old. Moreover, under R.C. 2125.02(A)(1), he is presumed to have suffered a loss from the wrongful death of his child. Accordingly, although Mason had not had recent contact with the decedent before his death (perhaps due to his mental illness), we cannot find that awarding him an amount totaling only four percent of the gross settlement proceeds was unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable (especially as compared to Bryson\u2019s 32 percent distribution).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">{\u00b6 51} Bryson argues that Mason\u2019s claim should have been dismissed altogether, however, because under R.C. 2125.02(A)(1), a parent who has abandoned a minor child decedent shall not receive a benefit in a wrongful-death action. Under R.C. 2125.02(G)(3), a parent of a minor child has \u201cabandoned\u201d the child when the parent failed without justifiable cause to communicate with, care for, or provide support for the minor for at least one year immediately prior to the death of the minor. Bryson contends that Mason had had no contact with the decedent for nine years prior to his death and, therefore, had abandoned him under R.C. 2125.02(A)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>{\u00b6 52} R.C. 2125.02(E) provides the method for establishing parental \u201cabandonment\u201d in a wrongful-death action. Under R.C. 2125.02(E)(1), the personal representative of the decedent\u2019s estate in a wrongful-death action may file a motion in the court in which the action is commenced, requesting that the court issue an order declaring that the parent abandoned the minor decedent and is not entitled to recover damages in the action. Such a motion may be filed at any time during the pendency of the action. Upon the filing of the motion, the court shall conduct a hearing at which the movant has the burden of proving abandonment. R.C. 2125.02(E)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">{\u00b6 53} The record reflects that Bryson never filed such a motion in federal court during the pendency of the wrongful-death action. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in denying Bryson\u2019s motion to dismiss Mason\u2019s claims on the basis of abandonment under R.C. 2125.02. Nevertheless, the trial court properly held that although Mason could participate in the hearing regarding distribution of the settlement proceeds, evidence that he had no contact with the decedent after 1993 was admissible to minimize the value of the loss to Mason.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">{\u00b6 54} Appellant\u2019s fourth, fifth, and sixth assignments of error are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">E. Award to Sierra</p>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">{\u00b6 55} In her seventh assignment of error, Bryson argues that the trial court abused its discretion in awarding Sierra any monies because the only evidence in the record was that she never had any relationship with the decedent. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-9\">{\u00b6 56} As a sibling, Sierra is entitled to monies only upon proof of actual damages suffered as a result of decedent\u2019s death. <em>Ramage, </em>64 Ohio St.3d at 105, 592 N.E.2d 828. Although Sierra testified that she was \u201csad\u201d upon learning of decedent\u2019s death, even a complete stranger to decedent could feel sad upon learning the circumstances of decedent\u2019s death. Although it was through no fault of her own, Sierra had no relationship whatsoever with decedent. Merely feeling \u201csad\u201d about his death does not entitle her to distribution. Accordingly, the trial court abused its discretion in awarding Sierra $1,295.13.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-10\">{\u00b6 57} Bryson\u2019s seventh assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-11\">F. Dr. Fabian\u2019s Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b592-12\">{\u00b6 58} During her testimony, Shirelle Palmer was asked whether Mason ever indicated to her, during the time she lived with him, that people were after him. She responded, \u201cYeah. He used to babble and talk to hisself.\u201d Upon objection by Bryson\u2019s counsel that the answer was unresponsive, the magistrate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>specifically instructed Palmer to answer the question, \u201cDid he [Mason] ever hear voices?\u201d Palmer responded, \u201cYes, he told me he did.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">{\u00b6 59} Subsequently, upon direct examination by Mason and Sierra\u2019s counsel, Dr. Fabian testified regarding his written report. He testified that he had interviewed Mason for a competency assessment and that his opinion, to a reasonable degree of \u201cpsychological probability,\u201d was that Mason presently suffers from schizophrenia, undifferentiated type. Counsel then asked Dr. Fabian what his opinion of Mason\u2019s condition in the early 1990s was, assuming \u201ca lack of proper dress, inappropriately dressed, that he couldn\u2019t carry on lucid conversations, that he babbled, that he was somewhat hallucinatory.\u201d The magistrate overruled the objection by Bryson\u2019s counsel and admitted Dr. Fabian\u2019s answer, which was that the symptoms were consistent with schizophrenia.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">{\u00b6 60} In her eighth assignment of error, Bryson argues that the magistrate erred in admitting this testimony because it was not in Dr. Fabian\u2019s written report, violated Civ.R. 26 and Loc.R. 21.1, and did not satisfy the reasonable certainty standard. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">{\u00b6 61} Under Evid.R. 703, the facts or data in a case upon which an expert bases his opinion may be those \u201cadmitted into evidence at the hearing.\u201d In response to questioning by the magistrate, Palmer specifically testified that Aaron Mason told her in the early 1990s that he heard voices. Palmer also testified that Mason babbled and began to dress inappropriately when she lived with him. Frank and Taylor likewise testified regarding Mason\u2019s inappropriate dress and inability to engage in meaningful conversations. Accordingly, the facts upon which Dr. Fabian based his opinion that Mason\u2019s behavior in the early 1990s was consistent with schizophrenia were based upon evidence admitted at the hearing. Thus, Bryson\u2019s argument that she was \u201cambushed\u201d by this testimony is without merit. Likewise, we find that Dr. Fabian\u2019s testimony was given to the requisite degree of medical certainty.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-8\">{\u00b6 62} Finally, we are unpersuaded by Bryson\u2019s argument that Dr. Fabian\u2019s testimony was unfairly prejudicial because without his testimony, the trial court would have concluded that Mason had abandoned decedent and consequently, would not have awarded him any monies. Palmer, Frank, and Taylor all testified that Aaron Mason\u2019s mental condition and ability to care for himself were deteriorating in the early 1990s. They testified further that they saw him on the streets, unable to acknowledge that he needed medical intervention. Thus, even without Dr. Fabian\u2019s opinion testimony that Mason\u2019s behavior in the early 1990s was consistent with schizophrenia, the evidence was clear that Mason was suffering from a serious mental illness, sufficient to mitigate his lack of contact with decedent after that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-9\">{\u00b6 63} Bryson\u2019s eighth assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>III. Mason and Sierra\u2019s Assignments of Error</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">A. Removal of Bryson as Administrator and Disqualification of Her Counsel</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">{\u00b6 64} In their first assignment of error, Mason and Sierra contend that the trial court erred in denying their objections seeking Bryson\u2019s removal as administrator and disqualification of her counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">(\u00b6 65} Bryson, as administrator, was the only person who could pursue and file a wrongful-death claim on behalf of decedent\u2019s next of kin. R.C. 2125.02; <em>Ramsey v. Neiman </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 508, 634 N.E.2d 211 (a cause of action in wrongful death arising under R.C. Chapter 2125 must be brought in the name of a person appointed by a court to be the administrator, executor, or personal representative of the decedent\u2019s estate). Aaron Mason and Sierra contend that Bryson breached her fiduciary duty to represent them in the wrongful-death action by not listing them in the complaint and then breached her fiduciary duty regarding their distribution of settlement proceeds because she took a position adverse to their interests by asserting that they were not entitled to any distribution. We find no breach of duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-8\">{\u00b6 66} The complaint specifically indicated that Bryson brought suit on behalf of all of decedent\u2019s next of kin, including Mason and Sierra, despite the fact that they were not specifically named in the complaint. Further, although neither Mason nor Sierra took any action to assert a claim or participate in the wrongful-death action, they both were permitted to present their claims relative to distribution of the settlement proceeds. Thus, their rights were adequately protected.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-9\">{\u00b6 67} Further, as administrator of the estate, Bryson was obligated to inform the court of law and facts that indicated that Aaron Mason and Sierra had not suffered any loss from decedent\u2019s death and therefore were not entitled to distribution of the settlement proceeds. Mason\u2019s lack of contact with the decedent in the nine years prior to his death and Sierra\u2019s lack of any relationship whatsoever with the decedent were clearly relevant to whether and what amount of distribution should have been made to them, at the expense of other next of kin. We find no breach of Bryson\u2019s fiduciary duty, nor any abuse of discretion in the trial court\u2019s denial of appellees\u2019 objection to Bryson as administrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-10\">(\u00b6 68} Likewise, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying appellees\u2019 objection to counsel\u2019s continuing representation of the estate. In their objection, appellees contended that counsel failed to adequately represent all of the statutory beneficiaries because they advised Bryson regarding Aaron Mason\u2019s lack of contact with the decedent and Sierra\u2019s lack of relationship with the decedent. They further argued that counsel\u2019s interest in obtaining their fees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>created an \u201cobvious conflict of interest\u201d with the beneficiaries of the settlement proceeds, including Bryson.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\">{\u00b6 69} We find no abuse of discretion, as appellees presented no evidence of conflict of interest or impropriety that would justify removal of Bryson\u2019s counsel. Counsel filed its application for contingency fees of 40 percent, to which Bryson had agreed, as allowed by Loc.R. 71.2. We find no cause to disqualify counsel simply because they are interested in obtaining payment of their fees. Moreover, we find nothing that would indicate that counsel had a conflict of interest with beneficiaries of the wrongful-death action simply because they advised the administrator of law and facts indicating that certain beneficiaries, who appeared only after the wrongful-death action was settled and had no relationship with decedent, were not entitled to distribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">{\u00b6 70} Appellees\u2019 first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">B. Distributions to Mason and Sierra</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">{\u00b6 71} In their second assignment of error, appellees contend that the trial court erred in not distributing the proceeds more \u201cequitably\u201d to Aaron Mason. In their third assignment of error, they argue that the court did not award Sierra an \u201cequitable\u201d amount. In short, appellees contend that they should have received larger distributions. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-8\">{\u00b6 72} As discussed above, the trial court should not have awarded Sierra any monies. With respect to Aaron Mason, the evidence was clear that his loss was minimal. Although Mason\u2019s schizophrenia might mitigate the purposefulness of his lack of contact with the decedent, the evidence established that Mason had no relationship with decedent for nine years prior to his death. Furthermore, he offered no evidence about any loss he suffered as a result of decedent\u2019s death. On this evidence, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in not awarding Mason a larger distribution of the settlement proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-9\">{\u00b6 73} Appellees\u2019 second and third assignments of error are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-10\">{\u00b6 74} The judgment is affirmed in part and reversed and remanded in part with instructions to the trial court to enter judgment awarding attorney fees of 40 percent to Bryson\u2019s counsel and distribution of net settlement proceeds as follows: $326,740.74 to Bryson, $50,595 to Tierra Mason, $2,100 to Bolton, $42,150 to Aaron Ricardo Mason, decedent\u2019s father, $0 to Sierra Mason, and $0 to Aaron Ramone Mason, decedent\u2019s brother, the amounts ordered by the magistrate.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-11\">Judgment affirmed in part and reversed in part, and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b595-12\">Cooney, A.J., and Boyle, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b585-20\">. This was obviously error as Mason\u2019s full name is Aaron <em>Ricardo </em>Mason and decedent's brother\u2019s name is Aaron <em>Ramone </em>Mason. Nevertheless, the magistrate\u2019s written decision was consistent in the way it (albeit erroneously) referred to decedent's father and decedent\u2019s brother.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b590-7\">. Thus, appellees\u2019 repeated assertion that Bryson has waived any error because she did not file objections to the magistrate's decision is specious. Bryson had no reason to file objections to the decision; although the magistrate changed the various distribution amounts suggested by Bryson, the magistrate ordered that the settlement monies be distributed to the four people Bryson had proposed should receive monies from the settlement and did not award monies to Mason or Sierra, whom Bryson had argued had no right to distribution.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b591-8\">. In light of the magistrate's findings, it seems likely that the magistrate intended to award Aaron Mason $42,150 and decedent's brother nothing; however, on its face, the decision indicates otherwise.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
