Rocco, Presiding Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b501-13\">{\u00b6 1} In these consolidated appeals, appellants B.M.,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> natural mother of the two subject children; N.S.,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> natural father of the child B.S.; and D.S.,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> natural father of the child D.M., each appeal from the decision of the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas, Juvenile Division, to terminate his or her parental rights and to grant permanent custody of the children to the Cuyahoga County Department of Children and Family Services (\u201cthe agency\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-14\">{\u00b6 2} B.M. presents three assignments of error. She claims that the juvenile court\u2019s decision should be reversed because the evidence presented had not demonstrated (1) that permanent custody was in her children\u2019s best interests, (2) that she had failed to remedy the conditions that caused her children\u2019s removal from her home, or (3) that the agency had made reasonable efforts to reunify her with her children.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-15\">{\u00b6 3} N.S. presents four assignments of error. He claims that under federal law, the juvenile court lacked jurisdiction to proceed and that the court also applied the wrong standard of proof under either federal or state law. He further claims that his trial counsel provided ineffective assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>{\u00b6 4} D.S. presents four assignments of error. He claims that the juvenile court failed to comply with notice requirements prior to proceeding with the action, that the court\u2019s decision is unsupported by sufficient evidence, that the court acted improperly when it decided the agency\u2019s motion for permanent custody as to two children at the same time, and that his trial counsel provided ineffective assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">{\u00b6 5} Upon a review of the record, this court notes that N.S. lacks standing to appeal the juvenile\u2019s court\u2019s decision as to D.M.; therefore, App. No. 92872 is dismissed. Furthermore, this court agrees with none of the appellants\u2019 claims. Consequently, their assignments of error are overruled, and the juvenile court\u2019s decision is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">{\u00b6 6} The record reflects that the agency initially sought predispositional temporary custody of D.M.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> on July 10, 2007. At that time, the child was approximately nine months old. Both B.M. and N.S., as putative father, stipulated to the need. Upon obtaining predispositional temporary custody of D.M., the agency immediately filed a motion for temporary custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">{\u00b6 7} According to the affidavit of the agency\u2019s social worker, Veronica Davis, due to B.M.\u2019s use of drugs during her pregnancy, D.M. had been born at only 29 weeks of gestation \u201cwith multiple medical problems.\u201d The child immediately had been transferred to a special children\u2019s hospital, where he had remained. Since the time of his birth, the child had undergone four heart surgeries. Although he was ready for discharge, he required \u201cmultiple medications\u201d and nourishment via a \u201cfeeding tube.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">{\u00b6 8} Davis averred that neither the mother, B.M., nor the putative father, N.S., was able to meet the child\u2019s specialized medical needs, that neither of them had attended instruction for learning the specialized care the child required, that neither of them had an adequate source of income and stable housing, that both of them had engaged in domestic violence against each other, that both of them used drugs and alcohol \u201cexcessively,\u201d and that neither of them had undertaken the recommended drug assessment or treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-9\">{\u00b6 9} Davis further alleged that N.S. had failed to establish paternity. As a last point, Davis indicated that if N.S. were not the child\u2019s father, the child\u2019s natural father had failed to either establish paternity or to support, visit, or communicate with D.M. since his birth.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-10\">{\u00b6 10} On September 18, 2007, a few months after the agency obtained temporary custody of D.M., B.M. gave birth to her second son, B.S. This child, too, was born with medical problems; B.M. tested positive for cocaine use during <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>her pregnancy and at B.S.\u2019s birth. The agency followed the same procedure with B.M.\u2019s second child, i.e., first obtaining emergency custody, with B.M. and N.S. both stipulating to the need.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">{\u00b6 11} At the emergency-custody hearing, the children\u2019s guardian ad litem (\u201cGAL\u201d) asked B.M. and N.S., \u201c[I]s there any Indian blood in the families?\u201d Only N.S. responded. He first indicated that his \u201cgrandmother\u201d was \u201cfull-blooded,\u201d then changed his answer to \u201cgreat-grandmother.\u201d N.S. asserted that this relative had been born on a reservation.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">{\u00b6 12} In reply to the court\u2019s follow-up question as to \u201cwhich tribe,\u201d N.S. further stated that this relative was \u201cSioux.\u201d The GAL told the court that with respect to D.M., she had been informed only that the child might have Cherokee blood. The GAL stated that because N.S. had never provided any indication that he had anything except Cherokee ancestors, all the previous custody notices had been sent to the Cherokee bands. N.S. indicated that he had Sioux ancestors on his \u201cmother\u2019s side\u201d and promised to obtain the information.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">{\u00b6 13} Both D.M. and B.S. were placed with the same foster family. The foster mother had been trained as a registered nurse.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">{\u00b6 14} The record reflects that after the agency filed a motion seeking temporary custody of B.S., the juvenile court conducted a hearing on the motion, referred both B.M. and N.S. to the \u201cdrug court,\u201d and continued the matter. The order was journalized on October 7, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-9\">{\u00b6 15} The drug court required both B.M. and N.S. to commit to taking steps for treatment. Both agreed to do so. However, the record reflects that each proved recalcitrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-10\">{\u00b6 16} On November 7, 2007, the agency filed an amended case plan for the family. To address substance-abuse and domestic-violence concerns, B.M. and N.S. agreed to \u201cattend, participate in and successfully complete treatment and aftercare\u201d and \u201cto attend, participate in and complete a Domestic Violence program.\u201d To address the children\u2019s needs for a proper physical environment, B.M. and N.S. agreed to secure and maintain safe and stable housing and to establish financial resources to support the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-11\">{\u00b6 17} B.M. also agreed to complete a psychological evaluation. N.S. agreed to establish paternity of the two boys, and, if paternity was established, to pay child support. For its part, the agency indicated that it would secure the resources to enable B.M. and N.S. to comply and would monitor their progress.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-12\">{\u00b6 18} On November 28, 2007, the juvenile court conducted a hearing on the agency\u2019s motion for temporary custody of B.S. After B.M. and N.S. admitted the allegations, the court entered an order finding the child to be neglected and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>dependent and granting the agency\u2019s motion. The order was journalized on December 13, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">{\u00b6 19} On January 15, 2008, the drug court discharged both B.M. and N.S. for their failure to comply with its requirements. The cases were returned to the juvenile court \u201cfor review of Temporary Custody.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">{\u00b6 20} On March 13, 2008, the agency filed motions for permanent custody of both children. The affidavits accompanying the motions were nearly identical.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">{\u00b6 21} Davis averred, among other things, that the parents (1) had failed to substantially remedy the conditions that caused the children to be placed outside the home, (2) had mental illnesses and chemical dependencies, (3) were unwilling to provide an adequate permanent home, and (4) placed the children at a substantial risk of harm. As to the last point, Davis particularly mentioned that the parents \u201crefused to familiarize themselves with and learn how to care for the [children\u2019s] specialized medical needs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">{\u00b6 22} On April 18, 2008, the agency filed a motion in D.M.\u2019s case to remove N.S. as a party. Genetic testing had proven that N.S. was not the child\u2019s biological father.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-9\">{\u00b6 23} On April 24, 2008, the agency filed a motion in D.M.\u2019s case to join D.S., N.S.\u2019s brother, as a party. Genetic testing had proven to a 99 percent certainty that D.S. was D.M.\u2019s biological father. The juvenile court granted both motions in an order dated May 20, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-10\">{\u00b6 24} D.S. established paternity of D.M. on June 25, 2008. At that point, the agency included him in the case plan for D.M.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-11\">{\u00b6 25} On June 17, 2008, the juvenile court issued a journal entry in both cases that scheduled them for a final pretrial hearing in July and scheduled a trial date on August 26, 2008. On July 29, 2008, the juvenile court appointed a GAL for D.S.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-12\">{\u00b6 26} By August, Davis noted on her case review that D.S. had complied with the need to establish paternity and with attending programs. When the cases were called on August 26, however, the matter had to be postponed.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-13\">{\u00b6 27} For the record, the agency\u2019s attorney indicated that she had used the information provided by the biological fathers to send notice of the proceeding on August 4, 2008, to the \u201cRosebud Sioux Tribe.\u201d She further indicated that on \u201cAugust 7, 2008 a representative from the Tribe signed for the certified mail,\u201d that the tribe\u2019s \u201cIndian Child Welfare Act [\u201cICWA\u201d] specialist\u201d had begun an official investigation, but that using the name provided, the specialist \u201ccould not find anybody.\u201d The agency\u2019s attorney concluded that she was \u201cjust waiting for the official documentation from the tribe that ICWA does not apply.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b505-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>{\u00b6 28} Based upon the need for additional time, the juvenile court scheduled another hearing for October 7, 2008. On September 3, 2008, the agency filed a notice with the court in D.M.\u2019s case that he was \u201cnot an Indian child as defined by 25 U.S.C.1903(4),\u201d and, thus, the case was not controlled by the ICWA. According to the attached exhibit, viz., a letter from the Rosebud Sioux Tribe\u2019s ICWA Specialist, neither the parents nor their ancestors had been \u201cenrolled\u201d in the tribe; therefore, the child was not eligible to be enrolled.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">{\u00b6 29} At the October 7, 2008 hearing, the agency notified the court that D.S. refused to submit a hair sample for drug-testing purposes. The court addressed D.S. about the need to comply with the agency\u2019s requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">{\u00b6 30} In his exchange with the court, D.S. complained about spending $150 for D.M.\u2019s birthday, then being unable to \u201clight candles\u201d to celebrate the occasion because of the medical prohibitions in place. D.S. also complained about his visits with D.M. being \u201ccanceled.\u201d D.S. acknowledged that he had problems with \u201csubstance abuse and mental illness, because I\u2019m bipolar.\u201d The court had to remind him that his son was \u201cmedically fragile\u201d and had to forbid him to videotape his son\u2019s diaper changes.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">{\u00b6 31} On December 2, 2008, the cases came to trial on the agency\u2019s motion for permanent custody. The court heard testimony from the following witnesses: (1) Cheryl Kunkler, the children\u2019s foster mother, (2) Davis, (3) Sandra Dvorak, president of Advantage Healthcare, the facility that performed the drug testing on samples provided by B.M., N.S., and D.S., and (4) Julie Alexander, family advocate in the agency\u2019s \u201cSTART\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">{\u00b6 32} In an order dated January 28, 2009, the juvenile court granted the agency\u2019s motions for permanent custody as to both D.M. and B.S. Appellants have appealed from that order. Their appeals will be addressed one by one.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">{\u00b6 33} In App. Nos. 92868 and 92870, B.M. presents the following assignments of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b505-9\">{\u00b6 34} \u201cI. The [Agency] failed to show by clear and convincing evidence that permanent custody is in the minor children\u2019s best interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-10\">{\u00b6 35} \u201cII. The [Agency] failed to show by clear and convincing evidence that appellant had not remedied the conditions which caused the removal of the children from the home.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-11\">{\u00b6 36} \u201cIII. The [Agency] failed to satisfy its burden to prove that it made reasonable efforts to reunify appellant and her children.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>{\u00b6 37} In a backwards manner, B.M. argues in her first and second assignments of error that the juvenile court\u2019s decision is unsupported in the record. This court disagrees.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">{\u00b6 38} The juvenile court must satisfy two requirements before ordering that a child be placed in the permanent custody of a children\u2019s services agency. First, the court must find by clear and convincing evidence that one of the four conditions under R.C. 2151.414(B)(1) exists. In this case, the court found that R.C. 2151.414(B)(1)(a) applied. <em>In re Baby Boy M., </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 91312, 2008-Ohio-5271, 2008 WL 4519120.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">{\u00b6 39} R.C. 2151.414(B)(1)(a) provides that \u201cthe court may grant permanent custody of a child to a movant if the court determines at the hearing held pursuant to division (A) of this section, by clear and convincing evidence, that it is in the best interest of the child to grant permanent custody of the child to the agency that filed the motion for permanent custody and that * * * the child is not abandoned or orphaned, [or] has not been in the temporary custody of one or more public children services agencies or private child placing agencies for 12 or more months of a consecutive twenty-two-month period, * * * and the child cannot be placed with either of the child\u2019s parents within a reasonable time or should not be placed with the child\u2019s parents.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">{\u00b6 40} Pursuant to R.C. 2151.414(E), \u201cin determining * * * whether a child cannot be placed with either parent within a reasonable period of time or should not be placed with the parents, the court shall consider all relevant evidence. If the court determines by clear and convincing evidence * * * that one or more of the following exist as to each of the child\u2019s parents, the court <em>shall </em>enter a finding that the child cannot be placed with either parent within a reasonable time or should not be placed with either parent.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">{\u00b6 41} The juvenile court is required only to consider the 16 factors, and only one factor needs to be resolved in favor of permanent custody to require the court to enter such a finding. <em>In re Hauserman </em>(Feb. 3, 2000), Cuyahoga App. No. 75831, 2000 WL 126754. In this case, the juvenile court found that at least two of the factors under R.C. 2151.414(E) had been met.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-9\">{\u00b6 42} The court found that B.M. failed to substantially remedy the conditions causing the children to be placed outside the home. R.C. 2151.414(E)(1). The court based this finding on the testimony that indicated that B.M. had failed to complete any portion of the case plan. Despite the agency\u2019s efforts to help her end her substance abuse, B.M. could not remain drug free.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-10\">{\u00b6 43} The court further found that B.M. had demonstrated a lack of commitment by failing to regularly support, visit, or communicate with the children, or by other actions that showed an unwillingness to provide a permanent home. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>R.C. 2151.414(E)(4). The court based this finding on testimony that indicated that B.M. not only lacked any conception of the extent of the medical needs of her children, but appeared to be at a loss when the children expressed discomfort in her presence.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">{\u00b6 44} Consequently, the trial court\u2019s determination that the children could not be placed with B.M. within a reasonable time was supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">{\u00b6 45} Since the juvenile court properly determined that one of the R.C. 2151.414(B)(1) conditions was met, this court proceeds to review whether the juvenile court appropriately determined, by clear and convincing evidence, that permanent custody is in the best interest of the children by considering all relevant factors, including those listed in R.C. 2151.414(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">{\u00b6 46} In determining the best interest of a child, a trial court is to consider all relevant factors, including, but not limited to, the five under R.C. 2151.414(D). The factors include \u201cthe interaction and interrelationship of the child with the child\u2019s parents, siblings, relatives, foster caregivers, and out-of-home providers; the wishes of the child; the custodial history of the child; the child\u2019s need for a legally secure permanent placement and whether that type of placement can be achieved without a grant of permanent custody to the agency * *</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">{\u00b6 47} The evidence in this case demonstrated that the children had extensive medical issues that required intensive attention to their needs. Kunkler testified, for instance, that it took \u201c14 hours a day\u201d in order \u201cto get [D.M.\u2019s] nutrition in him.\u201d Moreover, he had to have \u201chis medications a half-an-hour before the tube feed,\u201d and she had to calculate how much formula and how much water he received during the day. B.M., however, was not equipped either physically or mentally to attend to those needs.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-9\">{\u00b6 48} Since the children were too young to express their wishes, their GAL submitted a report in which she stated her belief that permanent custody was in the best interest of the children. The children had been in temporary custody since their births; at the time of the permanent-custody hearing, D.M. was two years old, and B.S. was a year old. The children required not only constant care and monitoring, but numerous medications, physical therapy, and additional surgeries.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-10\">{\u00b6 49} Based upon the evidence produced at the dispositional hearing, the trial court appropriately determined that permanent custody was in the best interest of the children. Accordingly, B.M.\u2019s first and second assignments of error are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-11\">{\u00b6 50} B.M. also argues that the juvenile court erred in finding that the agency made \u201creasonable efforts\u201d to prevent removal of the children from their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>home. She asserts that a more thorough analysis of the record, as warranted pursuant to R.C. 2151.419, undermines the juvenile court\u2019s finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">{\u00b6 51} The Ohio Supreme Court addressed this issue in <em>In re C.F., </em>113 Ohio St.3d 73, 2007-Ohio-1104, 862 N.E.2d 816, \u00b6 41, when the court stated, \u201c[B]y its terms, R.C. 2151.419 applies only at hearings held pursuant to R.C. 2151.28, 2151.31(E), 2151.314, 2151.33 or 2151.353. See R.C. 2151.419(A)(1). * * * The statute makes no reference to a hearing on a motion for permanent custody.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">{\u00b6 52} The Supreme Court went on to state, however, that \u201c[t]o the extent that the trial court relies on R.C. 2151.414(E)(1) at a permanency hearing, the court must examine the \u2018reasonable case planning and diligent efforts by the agency to assist the parents\u2019 when considering whether the child cannot or should not be placed with the parent within a reasonable time.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 42.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">{\u00b6 53} In this case, in relying upon R.C. 2151.414(E)(1), the juvenile court made a finding that the agency made reasonable efforts to reunify the children with B.M. This is supported in the record. Davis and Alexander testified that B.M. was referred for in-patient drug treatment, was encouraged to attend classes while D.M. was in the hospital to learn to care for his medical needs, and was referred to a domestic-violence program. B.M., however, \u201cnever followed through.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">{\u00b6 54} Therefore, the juvenile court\u2019s \u201creasonable efforts\u201d determination will not be disturbed. <em>In re D.J., </em>Cuyahoga App. Nos. 91916, 91917 and 91918, 2009-Ohio-1095, 2009 WL 625519; cf., <em>In re Baby Boy M., </em>2008-Ohio-5271, \u00b6 41.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-9\">{\u00b6 55} Accordingly, B.M.\u2019s third assignment of error also is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-10\">{\u00b6 56} In App. Nos. 92871 and 92872, N.S. presents the following assignments of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b508-11\">{\u00b6 57} \u201cI. The trial court lacked jurisdiction to hear the case as a result of a violation of due process under 25 U.S.C. Sections 1911 and 1912.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-12\">{\u00b6 58} \u201cII. The trial court erred when it granted permanent custody without the requisite findings mandated by 25 U.S.C.1912(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-13\">{\u00b6 59} \u201cHI. The trial court applied the wrong provisions of Ohio law when it concluded [that N.S.] failed to substantially remedy the condition that caused the removal of the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-14\">{\u00b6 60} \u201cIV. [N.S.] was deprived of his right to effective assistance of counsel when trial counsel failed to object to several matters that could be used to grant permanent custody.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b508-15\">{\u00b6 61} Prior to addressing N.S.\u2019s arguments, this court first notes that as to D.M., because N.S. is not the child\u2019s father, N.S. lacks standing to challenge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>the juvenile court\u2019s order granting permanent custody of D.M. to the agency. Consequently, App. No. 92872 is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">{\u00b6 62} N.S. argues in his first and second assignments of error that the juvenile court was required to comply with and then to apply federal law before proceeding to determine custody of B.S. because B.S. has Native American heritage. This court disagrees.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">{\u00b6 63} The record reflects that N.S. raised the possibility that his child had Native American ancestry. He provided no support for his suggestion. <em>In re Jordan </em>(Jan. 30, 2002), Summit App. Nos. 20773 and 20786, 2002 WL 121211.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">{\u00b6 64} Moreover, after receiving notice of the proceeding, none of the tribes N.S. mentioned claimed any interest in B.S. The tribes declined to participate specifically because B.S. was not deemed to be an \u201cIndian child,\u201d as defined by federal law. Under these circumstances, the issues N.S. raises in his first and second assignment of error lack merit and are therefore overruled. Id.; see also <em>In re Taylor, </em>Tuscarawas App. No. 2005 AP 11 0081, 2006-Ohio-6025, 2006 WL 3317719.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">{\u00b6 65} In his third assignment of error, N.S. asserts that the juvenile court relied improperly upon R.C. 2151.414(E)(1) in its decision. He argues that it is a \u201cgeneral\u201d provision, and, since the agency determined that he had substance-abuse problems, more \u201cspecific\u201d provisions, viz., R.C. 2151.414(E)(2) and (9), should have applied instead. This court disagrees.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-9\">{\u00b6 66} R.C. 2151.414 provides as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b509-10\">{\u00b6 67} \u201c(E) In determining at a hearing * * * whether a child cannot be placed with either parent within a reasonable period of time or should not be placed with the parents, the court shall consider all relevant evidence. If the court determines, by clear and convincing evidence, * * * that one or more of the following exist as to each of the child\u2019s parents, the court shall enter a finding that the child cannot be placed with either parent within a reasonable time or should not be placed with either parent:</p>\n<p id=\"b509-11\">{\u00b6 68} \u201c(1) Following the placement of the child outside the child\u2019s home and notwithstanding reasonable case planning and diligent efforts by the agency to assist the parents to remedy the problems that initially caused the child to be placed outside the home, the parent has failed continuously and repeatedly to substantially remedy the conditions causing the child to be placed outside the child\u2019s home. In determining whether the parents have substantially remedied those conditions, the court shall consider parental utilization of medical, psychiatric, psychological, and other social and rehabilitative services and material <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>resources that were made available to the parents for the purpose of changing parental conduct to allow them to resume and maintain parental duties;</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">{\u00b6 69} \u201c(2) Chronic mental illness, chronic emotional illness, * * * or chemical dependency of the parent that is so severe that it makes the parent unable to provide an adequate permanent home for the child at the present time and, as anticipated, within one year after the court holds the hearing * * *;</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">{\u00b6 70} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">{\u00b6 71} \u201c(9) The parent has placed the child at substantial risk of harm two or more times due to alcohol or drug abuse and has rejected treatment two or more times or refused to participate in further treatment two or more times after a case plan issued pursuant to section 2151.412 [2151.41.2] of the Revised Code requiring treatment of the parent was journalized as part of a dispositional order issued with respect to the child or an order was issued by any other court requiring treatment of the parent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">{\u00b6 72} R.C. 1.51 provides that if a general provision <em>irreconcilably </em>conflicts with a special provision, the special provision prevails as an exception to the general provision. However, related sections of the Revised Code must be construed together. <em>D.A.B.E., Inc. v. Toledo-Lucas Cty. Bd. of Health, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 250, 2002-Ohio-4172, 773 N.E.2d 536, \u00b6 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-9\">(\u00b6 73} In cases of statutory construction, the \u201cparamount concern is the legislative intent in enacting the statute.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Steele v. Morrissey, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 355, 2004-Ohio-4960, 815 N.E.2d 1107, \u00b6 21. To determine the intent, the reviewing court first examines the statutory language, reading words and phrases in context and construing them according to the rules of grammar and common usage. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-10\">{\u00b6 74} R.C. 2151.414(E) obviously was intended to permit the juvenile court to examine the matter of whether an award of permanent custody is in the best interests of the child in the most comprehensive manner possible. When construed together, therefore, none of the provisions \u201cirreconcilably conflicts\u201d with another.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-11\">{\u00b6 75} Since the juvenile court in this case thus did not act improperly in applying the law to the facts presented, N.S.\u2019s third assignment of error also is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-12\">{\u00b6 76} N.S. argues in his fourth assignment of error that his trial counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to object to \u201cinadmissible\u201d evidence during the dispositional hearing. In particular, he asserts that Kunkler was \u201cunqualified\u201d to offer testimony about the children\u2019s medical needs and that Dvorak\u2019s testimony about N.S.\u2019s drug-test results constituted hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>{\u00b6 77} The two-part test for ineffective assistance of counsel used in criminal cases, as set forth in <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674, applies equally in actions by the state to force the permanent, involuntary termination of parental rights. <em>Jones v. Lucas Cty. Children Servs. Bd. </em>(1988), 46 Ohio App.3d 85, 86, 546 N.E.2d 471. The appellant first must show that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient. To meet that requirement, he must demonstrate that his counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the \u201ccounsel\u201d as guaranteed to a defendant by the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution. Id. at 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">{\u00b6 78} In addition, the appellant must show that counsel\u2019s deficient performance prejudiced his case. In order to meet the second requirement, the appellant must demonstrate that counsel\u2019s errors were so serious as to render the result of the trial unreliable. Id. In effect, the appellant must show that there is a reasonable probability that but for counsel\u2019s errors, the result of the trial would have been different. Id. at 694,104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">{\u00b6 79} A review of the record in this case fails to support N.S.\u2019s claim. Kunkler testified that she was an RN, and she had taken care of B.S. since his placement in her home when he was three days old. She knew from her own experience with him that he had a low birth weight, left-sided weakness, an asymmetrical body, and trouble breathing, that he is milk-intolerant, and that he is macrocephalic, which means that his \u201chead is too large\u201d for his body. Since Kunkler\u2019s testimony comported with Evid.R. 701, trial counsel had no reason to object to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">{\u00b6 80} Similarly, Dvorak\u2019s testimony concerning the drug-test results was admissible pursuant to Evid.R. 803(6). Counsel is not deemed ineffective merely for failing to raise baseless objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">{\u00b6 81} The record reflects that N.S.\u2019s counsel represented his client in a diligent, competent manner. Accordingly, N.S.\u2019s fourth assignment of error also is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-9\">{\u00b6 82} In App. No. 92880, D.S. presents the following assignments of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b511-10\">{\u00b6 83} \u201cI. The trial court committed error when it failed to comply with the mandatory notice requirements of 25 U.S.C. 1912.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-11\">{\u00b6 84} \u201cII. The trial court erred when it terminated Appellant\u2019s parental rights and granted permanent custody to [the agency].</p>\n<p id=\"b511-12\">{\u00b6 85} \u201cHI. Appellant was prejudiced when the trial court allowed two unrelated permanent custody cases to be heard simultaneously.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-13\">{\u00b6 86} \u201cIV. Appellant was denied effective assistance of trial counsel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>{\u00b6 87} As his brother did in App. No. 92872, D.S. argues in his first assignment of error that the juvenile court was required to comply with and then to apply federal law before proceeding to determine custody of D.M. because D.M. has Native American heritage.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">{\u00b6 88} For the same reasons as hereinbefore stated, since the record demonstrates that D.M. is not an \u201cIndian child,\u201d D.S.\u2019s argument lacks merit. Consequently, his first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">{\u00b6 89} D.S. argues in his second assignment of error that the juvenile court\u2019s decision to terminate his parental rights is unsupported in the record. This argument is also rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">{\u00b6 90} The juvenile court found that at the time of the dispositional hearing, D.S. lacked stable housing, relied upon \u201cSSI\u201d as his income, refused to provide a hair sample for drug-testing purposes, and remained unable to meet D.M.\u2019s extensive medical needs. The court additionally stated that placement with D.S. constituted a threat to the child\u2019s safety. R.C. 2151.414(E)(15).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">{\u00b6 91} These findings are supported by D.S.\u2019s comments at the pretrial conferences. In speaking with the court about the necessary steps required to have more access to D.M., D.S. demonstrated a remarkable lack of insight, an egocentric outlook, and a combative nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-9\">{\u00b6 92} Moreover, Davis testified that during D.M.\u2019s last surgical recovery, D.S. became disruptive even prior to entering the child\u2019s room, then attempted to gain his sleeping son\u2019s attention by \u201cbopping him on the head\u201d continuously. Davis stated that D.S. ultimately had to be ejected from the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-10\">{\u00b6 93} Since the juvenile court\u2019s decision to terminate D.S.\u2019s parental rights is based upon clear and convincing evidence presented in the record, D.S.\u2019s second assignment of error also is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-11\">{\u00b6 94} In his third assignment of error, D.S. argues that the juvenile court erred in failing to bifurcate his son\u2019s case from B.S.\u2019s after the paternity issue was resolved. This court notes that the same mother gave birth to both children, belying D.S.\u2019s characterization of these cases as \u201cunrelated.\u201d Nevertheless, D.S. never raised this issue in the juvenile court. Consequently, he has waived this argument for purposes of appeal. See, e.g., <em>In re Roberts, </em>Guernsey App. No. 04 CA 29, 2005-Ohio-2843, 2005 WL 1364611, \u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-12\">{\u00b6 95} D.S. finally claims in his fourth assignment of error that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance. D.S. bases this claim on counsel\u2019s failure to call any witnesses and to raise objections to the testimony presented by the agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-13\">{\u00b6 96} As previously stated, in order to demonstrate his claim, N.S. first must show that his trial counsel\u2019s performance was deficient. <em>In re C.P., </em>Franklin <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>App. No. 08AP-1128, 2009-Ohio-2760, 2009 WL 1653556, \u00b6 57. This court presumes counsel\u2019s competency and will not second-guess matters of trial strategy. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">{\u00b6 97} The decisions to call witnesses and to raise objections clearly are matters of trial strategy. Id., \u00b6 64. The record in this case shows that D.S.\u2019s trial counsel thoroughly cross-examined the agency\u2019s witnesses and pointed out whatever weaknesses they displayed during their direct examinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">{\u00b6 98} The record reflects that D.S.\u2019s counsel was fully prepared for the proceeding, diligent in his efforts on his client\u2019s behalf, and represented D.S. in a highly competent manner. Because D.S. cannot demonstrate that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance, his fourth assignment of error also is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">{\u00b6 99} App. No. 92872 is dismissed. In App. Nos. 92868, 92870, 92871, and 92880, the juvenile court\u2019s order is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-8\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b513-9\">Kilbane and Sweeney, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b501-16\">.
