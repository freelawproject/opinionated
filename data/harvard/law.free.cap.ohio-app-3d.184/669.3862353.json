According to Engel\u2019s complaint, Skoskiewicz negligently performed two separate surgical procedures on Engel in January 2005, proximately causing Engel pain, additional medical bills, lost wages, and emotional distress. As trial neared, Skoskiewicz filed a motion to dismiss or, in the alternative, for a stay in the proceedings. In his motion, Skoskiewicz claimed personal immunity under R.C. 9.86, which exempts state officers and employees from liability in any civil action arising under state law for damage or injury caused in the performance of the officer\u2019s or employee\u2019s duties, unless the officer or employee acted manifestly outside the scope of his employ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>ment or official responsibilities, or with malicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a wanton or reckless manner. Because only the Court of Claims can determine whether a state officer or employee is immune under R.C. 9.86, Skoskiewicz argued that the common pleas court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction to proceed. The court agreed and granted Skoskiewicz a stay pending the outcome of the Court of Claim\u2019s immunity determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\">{\u00b6 3} Following the common pleas court\u2019s ruling, Engel filed a medical-malpractice action against UT in the Court of Claims and reiterated the claims he initially asserted in the common pleas court. As part of his complaint, Engel requested that the Court of Claims determine whether Skoskiewicz was entitled to immunity. Ultimately, the Court of Claims agreed to decide the issue of Skoskiewicz\u2019s immunity based upon a joint stipulation of facts and the parties\u2019 briefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">{\u00b6 4} The parties stipulated that the UT<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Board of Trustees appointed Skoskiewicz as a clinical assistant professor of surgery on December 13, 2004. The appointment made Skoskiewicz a volunteer faculty member, not a regular faculty member. As a volunteer faculty member, Skoskiewicz did not receive a salary from UT. Nevertheless, Skoskiewicz was subject to the UT Faculty Rules and Regulations, as well as UT policies and procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">{\u00b6 5} The UT Board of Trustees made the volunteer faculty appointment so Skoskiewicz could act as a preceptor for third-year UT students. Bryan/MCO Area Health Education Center, Inc. (\u201cBAHEC\u201d), a nonprofit corporation affiliated with UT, arranged for UT students to observe and assist local practitioners, and Skoskiewicz agreed to become an instructor in this apprenticeship program. BAHEC assigned UT student David Essig to Skoskiewicz so Essig could complete his required clinical rotation in surgery. Essig was present in the operating room while Skoskiewicz performed the two surgical procedures on Engel.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">{\u00b6 6} Based upon these facts, the Court of Claims found that Skoskiewicz\u2019s appointment as a clinical assistant professor of surgery made him a state \u201cofficer or employee\u201d as defined in R.C. 109.36(A)(1)(a). Additionally, the court found that Skoskiewicz was acting in the scope of his position when he performed the two surgical procedures at issue. Accordingly, in a December 18, 2008 judgment entry, the Court of Claims determined that Skoskiewicz was personally immune from Engel\u2019s claims pursuant to R.C. 9.86.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-8\">{\u00b6 7} UT now appeals from the December 18, 2008 judgment and assigns the following error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>The Court of Claims erred in holding that a physician who is a volunteer clinical faculty member of a state medical school is an \u201cofficer or employee\u201d of the state as that term is defined in R.C. 109.36, and so is entitled to immunity from civil liability for medical negligence under R.C. 9.86.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">{\u00b6 8} By its sole assignment of error, UT argues that Skoskiewicz is not entitled to personal immunity, because he is not a state officer or employee. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\"> {\u00b6 9} Pursuant to R.C. 9.86,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-7\">[ejxcept for civil actions that arise out of the operation of a motor vehicle and civil actions in which the state is the plaintiff, no officer or employee shall be liable in any civil action that arises under the law of this state for damage or injury caused in the performance of his duties, unless the officer\u2019s or employee\u2019s actions were manifestly outside the scope of his employment or official responsibilities, or unless the officer or employee acted with malicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a wanton or reckless manner.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b706-8\">Generally, under this statute, a state officer or employee who acts in the performance of his or her duties is immune from liability. <em>Wassenaar v. Ohio Dept. of Rehab. &amp; </em>Corr., 10th Dist. No. 07AP-712, 2008-Ohio-1220, 2008 WL 713932, \u00b6 25. Whether a person is entitled to personal immunity is a question of law. <em>Theobald v. Univ. of Cincinnati, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 541, 2006-Ohio-6208, 857 N.E.2d 573, \u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-9\">{\u00b6 10} For the purposes of R.C. 9.86, \u201cofficer or employee\u201d is defined by R.C. 109.36(A). R.C. 2743.02(A)(2) and (F). R.C. 109.36(A)(1)(a) defines \u201cofficer or employee\u201d to mean \u201c[a] person who, at the time a cause of action against the person arises, is serving in an elected or appointed office or position with the state or is employed by the state.\u201d Engel argues that Skoskiewicz satisfies this definition because, at the time of the alleged malpractice, he was serving in an \u201cappointed * * * position with the state.\u201d Supporting Engel\u2019s argument, the March 18, 2005 letter from UT to Skoskiewicz informed him that the UT Board of Trustees had \u201capproved [his] <em>appointment </em>to the volunteer faculty at its meeting December 13, 2004 as * * * Clinical Assistant Professor * * * Surgery.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Thus, Skoskiewicz was appointed to his position as a clinical assistant professor of surgery. Additionally, UT is a state institution, created and authorized by the General Assembly. R.C. 3350.01, repealed by Sub.H.B. No. 478, effective July 1, 2006 (\u201cThere is hereby created the medical university of Ohio at Toledo\u201d); R.C. 3364.01(A) (combining the former Medical University of Ohio with the University of Toledo, both \u201cauthorized\u201d under former provisions of the Revised Code). Thus, Skoskiewicz\u2019s position was \u201cwith the state.\u201d As Skoskiewicz was serving in an appointed position with the state at the time he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>allegedly committed malpractice, we conclude that he meets the statutory definition of \u201cofficer or employee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">{\u00b6 11} In arguing that Skoskiewicz is not a state \u201cofficer or employee,\u201d UT primarily focuses on the portion of R.C. 109.36(A)(1)(a) that defines an \u201cofficer or employee\u201d as a person who \u201cis employed by the state.\u201d However, the use of the disjunctive \u201cor\u201d between the two portions of the subsection indicates that each portion sets forth a separate and distinct definition of \u201cofficer or employee.\u201d <em>Columbia Gas Transm. Corp. v. Levin, </em>117 Ohio St.3d 122, 2008-Ohio-511, 882 N.E.2d 400, \u00b6 20, quoting <em>Pizza v. Sunset Fireworks Co., Inc. </em>(1986), 25 Ohio St.3d 1, 4-5, 25 OBR 1, 494 N.E.2d 1115 (defining \u201cor\u201d as \u201c \u2018a function word indicating an alternative between different or unlike things\u2019 \u201d and concluding that the use of \u201cor,\u201d instead of \u201cand,\u201d evidenced an intent that each element of the disjunctive phrase be read separately from the others). Consequently, a person is an \u201cofficer or employee\u201d if he is either \u201cserving in an * * * appointed * * * position with the state\u201d <em>or </em>he \u201cis employed by the state.\u201d As Skoskiewicz meets the first definition, the second is irrelevant.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">{\u00b6 12} UT next argues that \u201cappointed\u201d as used in R.C. 109.36(A)(1)(a) refers only to appointments made by the governor or other state officials as authorized in the Revised Code. Thus, UT contends, if a person is not appointed to an office or position created by statute, then he is not an \u201cofficer or employee\u201d as defined in R.C. 109.36(A)(1)(a). UT\u2019s argument ignores the primary rule of statutory interpretation \u2014 courts must apply a statute as written when its meaning is definite and unambiguous. <em>Columbia Gas Transm. Corp. </em>at \u00b6 19; <em>Portage Cty. Bd. of Commrs. v. Akron, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 106, 2006-Ohio-954, 846 N.E.2d 478, \u00b6 52. Here, R.C. 109.36(A)(1)(a) conveys a clear, unequivocal meaning. To give R.C. 109.36(A)(1)(a) the narrow interpretation UT seeks, we would have to read into the subsection language qualifying and explaining the word \u201cappointed.\u201d Courts, however, cannot insert language into a statute through the guise of interpretation. <em>Hall v. Banc One Mgt. Corp., </em>114 Ohio St.3d 484, 2007-Ohio-4640, 873 N.E.2d 290, \u00b6 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">{\u00b6 13} UT also argues that because it appointed Skoskiewicz to the volunteer faculty, instead of the regular faculty, he is not an \u201cofficer or employee\u201d as defined in R.C. 109.36(A)(1)(a). To support this argument, UT relies upon <em>Walton v. Ohio Dept. of Health, </em>162 Ohio App.3d 65, 2005-Ohio-3375, 832 N.E.2d 790. UT contends that in <em>Walton, </em>this court held that the volunteer status of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>appointee to an HIV-prevention community planning group prevented him from being an \u201cofficer or employee\u201d under R.C. 109.36(A)(1)(a). We find that UT mischaracterizes the holding of <em>Walton. </em>In that case, the Ohio Department of Health had appointed the plaintiff to an HIV-prevention community planning group, and the plaintiff claimed that his appointment made him an \u201cofficer or employee\u201d under R.C. 109.36(A)(1)(a). The planning group, however, was neither created by state statute nor substantially controlled by the state. Because the planning group was, \u201cto a significant extent, separate and distinct from the state,\u201d the plaintiffs appointment was not \u201cwith the state\u201d as required by R.C. 109.36(A)(1)(a). Id. at \u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">{\u00b6 14} In the case at bar, no one disputes that UT is a state institution. Consequently, unlike the plaintiff in <em>Walton, </em>Skoskiewicz was appointed to a position \u201cwith the state.\u201d <em>Walton, </em>therefore, has no applicability here.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">{\u00b6 15} Finally, UT argues that extending personal immunity to a volunteer faculty member is simply bad policy. UT directs this argument to the wrong branch of government. The General Assembly is the final arbiter of public policy; it is not the judiciary\u2019s role to weigh policy concerns or make policy decisions. <em>Rankin v. Cuyahoga Cty. Dept. of Children &amp; Family Servs., </em>118 Ohio St.3d 392, 2008-Ohio-2567, 889 N.E.2d 521, \u00b6 34; <em>Groch v. Gen. Motors Corp., </em>117 Ohio St.3d 192, 2008-Ohio-546, 883 N.E.2d 377, \u00b6 212.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">{\u00b6 16} Because Skoskiewicz satisfies the definition of \u201cofficer or employee\u201d in R.C. 109.36(A)(1)(a), we conclude that he is a state officer or employee. Accordingly, we overrule UT\u2019s assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-8\">{\u00b6 17} For the foregoing reasons, we overrule UT\u2019s sole assignment of error, and we affirm the judgment of the Court of Claims of Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b708-10\">Bryant and Connor, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b705-9\">.
