In response, appellant sent a letter to appellee, dated June 15, 2007, asserting that the Bingo Club was exempt from smoking prohibitions under the act\u2019s \u201cprivate club\u201d exception. On August 6, 2007, appellee issued a letter of warning to appellant, notifying appellant that it had been found in violation of the act and that \u201c[subsequent violations may result in the imposition of a civil fine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">{\u00b6 3} By correspondence dated September 18, 2007, appellee informed appellant that a report had been filed alleging violations of the SmokeFree Act occurring at the Bingo Club in September 2007. Specifically, the notice alleged the following violations: \u201cSmoking in Prohibited Area\u201d and \u201cAshtray Present.\u201d On October 12, 2007, appellant sent a letter to appellee requesting that its operation be deemed exempt from the mandates of the SmokeFree Act and also requesting an administrative review. An investigator for appellee visited the Bingo Club on September 28, 2007, and reported observing ashtrays throughout the facility, as well as several individuals smoking. On November 5, 2007, appellee notified appellant that it had been found in violation of the act and that a civil fine of $100 would be imposed because appellant had a previous finding of violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">{\u00b6 4} On November 7, 2007, appellee informed appellant that an investigation had been opened in response to a report of further alleged violations of the SmokeFree Act occurring at the Bingo Club in November 2007. This notice alleged the following violations: \u201cSmoking in Prohibited Area\u201d and \u201cInadequate Signs Posted.\u201d An investigator visited the site on November 30, 2007, and reported observing ashtrays at the facility, as well as several bingo players smoking. By correspondence dated January 18, 2008, appellant requested an administrative review of this proposed violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-8\">{\u00b6 5} On February 29, 2008, an administrative hearing was held before an independent decision-maker (\u201chearing examiner\u201d) regarding alleged violations observed by investigators at the Bingo Club on September 28 and November 30, 2007. The hearing examiner issued a decision on April 21, 2008, including <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>findings of fact and conclusions of law, finding that appellant did not qualify for the act\u2019s private-club exemption because the Bingo Club was not located in a freestanding structure occupied solely by the club, as required under R.C. 3794.03(G). The hearing examiner further found that appellant, on the two dates in question, permitted smoking on the premises in violation of R.C. 3704.02(A) and 3794.06(B). The hearing examiner determined that a fine of $100 was appropriate for the violation occurring on September 28, 2007, and that a fine of $500 was appropriate for the violation occurring on November 30, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\">{\u00b6 6} Appellant filed objections to the hearing examiner\u2019s decision. On May 12, 2008, appellee issued an order affirming the hearing examiner\u2019s decision. On May 30, 2008, appellant filed an appeal with the trial court pursuant to R.C. 119.12 and 3794.09. By decision and entry filed on November 25, 2008, the trial court affirmed the adjudication order of appellee, finding that the order was supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence and was in accordance with law.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">{\u00b6 7} On appeal, appellant sets forth the following four assignments of error for this court\u2019s review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-6\">Assignment of Error No. I:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-7\">The court erred in finding the appellees\u2019 May 15, 2008 administrative order is supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence and is in accordance with the law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-8\">Assignment of Error No. II:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-9\">The court erred in finding the appellant is subject to the Ohio Smoke-Free Workplace Act because it operates a \u201cplace of employment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-10\">Assignment of Error No. Ill:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-11\">The court erred in finding the appellant does not qualify for the Ohio Smoke-Free Workplace Act\u2019s \u201cprivate club\u201d exemption because the appellant is not located in a freestanding structure occupied solely by the appellant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-12\">Assignment of Error No. IV:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-13\">The court erred in finding the appellees\u2019 delay in providing appellant with a timely hearing on proposed violations of the Ohio Smoke-Free Workplace Act did not deny the appellant due process of law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b633-14\">{\u00b6 8} Appellant\u2019s first, second, and third assignments of error are interrelated and will be considered together. Under these assignments of error, appellant argues that the trial court erred in finding that appellee\u2019s order was supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence and was in accordance with law. Further, appellant contends that the court erred in finding that the Bingo Club is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>a \u201cplace of employment\u201d and in affirming appellee\u2019s determination that the Bingo Club is not located in a freestanding structure occupied solely by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">{\u00b6 9} R.C. 119.12 provides that a court of common pleas:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-5\">[M]ay affirm the order of the agency complained of in the appeal if it finds, upon consideration of the entire record and any additional evidence the court has admitted, that the order is supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence and is in accordance with law. In the absence of this finding, it may reverse, vacate, or modify the order or make such other ruling as is supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence and is in accordance with law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">{\u00b6 10} In <em>2216 SA, Inc. v. Ohio Liquor Control Comm., </em>10th Dist. No. 07AP-600, 2007-Ohio-7014, 2007 WL 4532701, \u00b6 7-8, this court delineated the applicable standards of review for the court of common pleas and an appellate court in reviewing an administrative appeal, stating as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-7\">The common pleas court\u2019s \u201creview of the administrative record is neither a trial <em>de novo </em>nor an appeal on questions of law only, but a hybrid review in which the court \u2018must appraise all the evidence as to the credibility of the witnesses, the probative character of the evidence, and the weight thereof.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lies v. Veterinary Med. Bd. </em>(1981), 2 Ohio App.3d 204, 207[, 2 OBR 223], 441 N.E.2d 584, quoting <em>Andrews v. Bd. of Liquor Control </em>(1955), 164 Ohio St. 275, 280[, 58 O.O. 51, 131 N.E.2d 390]. Even though the common pleas court must give due deference to the administrative agency\u2019s resolution of evidentiary conflicts, the findings of the agency are not conclusive. <em>Univ. of Cincinnati v. Conrad </em>(1980), 63 Ohio St.2d 108, 111[, 17 O.O.3d 65, 407 N.E.2d 1265].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-8\">An appellate court\u2019s standard of review in an administrative appeal is more limited than that of a common pleas court. <em>Pons v. Ohio State Med. Bd. </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 619, 621, 614 N.E.2d 748. It is not the function of the appellate court to examine the evidence. Id. The appellate court is to determine only if the trial court has abused its discretion. Id. Abuse of discretion is not merely an error of judgment, but perversity of will, passion, prejudice, partiality, or moral delinquency. Id. Absent an abuse of discretion on the part of the trial court, an appellate court may not substitute its judgment for that of an administrative agency or a trial court. Id. Nonetheless, an appellate court does have plenary review of purely legal questions in an administrative appeal. <em>Big Bob\u2019s, Inc. v. Ohio Liquor Control Comm., </em>151 Ohio App.3d 498, 2003-Ohio-418[, 784 N.E.2d 753], at \u00b6 15. Accordingly, we must also determine whether the common pleas court\u2019s decision is in accordance with law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b634-9\">{\u00b6 11} Ohio\u2019s SmokeFree Act, codified under R.C. Chapter 3794, became effective on December 7, 2006. R.C. 3794.02(A) states as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>No proprietor of a public place or place of employment, except as permitted in section 3794.03 of this chapter, shall permit smoking in the public place or place of employment or in the areas directly or indirectly under the control of the proprietor immediately adjacent to locations of ingress or egress to the public place or place of employment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b635-4\">{\u00b6 12} R.C. 3794.03 lists several exemptions under the act, including an exemption for \u201cprivate clubs.\u201d Specifically, R.C. 3794.03 states:</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">The following shall be exempt from the provisions of this chapter:</p>\n<p id=\"AqJC\">***</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-6\">(G) Private clubs as defined in section 4301.01(B)(13) of the Revised Code, provided all of the following apply: the club has no employees; the club is organized as a not for profit entity; only members of the club are present in the club\u2019s building; no persons under the age of eighteen are present in the club\u2019s building; the club is located in a freestanding structure occupied solely by the club; smoke from the club does not migrate into an enclosed area where smoking is prohibited under the provisions of this chapter; and, if the club serves alcohol, it holds a valid D4 liquor permit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">{\u00b6 13} Thus, pursuant to R.C. 3794.03(G), a private club is exempt from the smoking prohibitions of the act \u201cprovided all\u201d of the above listed criteria are met. As noted under the facts, the hearing examiner and appellee concluded that appellant did not qualify for the private-club exemption based upon a determination that the Bingo Club was not located in a freestanding structure occupied solely by the club. We initially address appellant\u2019s contention that the trial court erred in affirming appellee\u2019s determination on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">{\u00b6 14} Appellant argues that ambiguity arises from the language of R.C. 3794.03(G) because rules promulgated by the Ohio Department of Health do not define the meaning of the phrases \u201cfreestanding structure\u201d and \u201coccupied solely by the club.\u201d Appellant maintains that the portion of the building utilized by the Bingo Club fits the usual definition of a \u201cfreestanding structure\u201d and further argues that the Bingo Club is \u201coccupied solely by the club\u201d because it is the only tenant occupying the structure during its hours of operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-9\">{\u00b6 15} We first address appellant\u2019s arguments that the term \u201cfreestanding structure\u201d is ambiguous and that the portion of the building in which the Bingo Club operates is a freestanding structure. During the administrative proceedings, the hearing examiner heard testimony regarding the layout of the facility, and certain exhibits were admitted on this issue. The hearing examiner\u2019s report cited testimony that appellant\u2019s bingo hall constitutes one of several different operations conducted in separate rooms within a single structure; specifically, in addition to a bingo-hall room, the structure contains rooms housing a flea market, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>a concession stand, and a boxing school/gym. A diagram of the facility was submitted as part of the evidence, depicting the bingo hall, flea market, and an adjoining boxing school/gym, all located inside the same building. During the administrative hearing, an investigator testified that vendors operate a concession stand in a space between the boxing school/gym and the flea market during bingo hours. The hearing examiner concluded that there was credible evidence presented that the facility in which the Bingo Club conducts its operation is not a \u201cfreestanding structure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">{\u00b6 16} The trial court, in addressing appellant\u2019s argument that the statute and accompanying regulations do not define \u201cfreestanding structure,\u201d cited dictionary definitions of \u201cfreestanding\u201d to mean \u201cstanding alone,\u201d \u201cnot attached to or supported by anything,\u201d and \u201cnot physically attached to another unit.\u201d The court further noted that appellant\u2019s bingo operation took place in one of five separate rooms in the building, that the bingo room was physically attached to two of the other rooms by sharing common walls, and that it also shared a wall with the lobby area. In considering the above definitions of \u201cfreestanding,\u201d as well as the record evidence of the layout of the bingo hall and its surroundings, the trial court agreed with appellee\u2019s determination that the Bingo Club was not located in a freestanding structure.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\"> {\u00b6 17} In general, \u201c[a] reviewing court, in interpreting a statute, \u2018must give due deference to an administrative interpretation formulated by an agency which has accumulated substantial expertise, and to which the legislature has delegated the responsibility of implementing the legislative command.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re 138 Mazal Health Care, Ltd. </em>(1997), 117 Ohio App.3d 679, 685, 691 N.E.2d 338, quoting <em>State ex rel. McLean v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1986), 25 Ohio St.3d 90, 25 OBR 141, 495 N.E.2d 370. Furthermore, \u201cin order to sustain an agency\u2019s application of a statutory term, a reviewing court \u2018 \u201cneed not find that its construction is the only reasonable one.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>138 Mazal Health Care </em>at 685, 691 N.E.2d 338, quoting <em>Udall v. Tollman </em>(1965), 380 U.S. 1, 16, 85 S.Ct. 792, 13 L.Ed.2d 616, quoting <em>Unemp. Comp. Comm. of Territory of Alaska v. Aragon </em>(1946), 329 U.S. 143, 153, 67 S.Ct. 245, 91 L.Ed. 136.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">{\u00b6 18} Although the term \u201cfreestanding structure\u201d is not defined under the statute or accompanying rules, we find appellee\u2019s interpretation of that term, and its application of the statute to the facts of this case, to be reasonable. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court did not err in deferring to the agency\u2019s construction of the statute and its determination that the Bingo Club was not located in a freestanding structure.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">{\u00b6 19} We note that appellant\u2019s primary argument in support of an ambiguity pertains to the phrase \u201coccupied solely by the club.\u201d Appellant maintains that this provision of the statute would allow the Bingo Club to operate in a building <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>occupied by other tenants as long as the bingo operation is conducted during hours of the day in which other tenants are not using their spaces. The trial court, however, found appellant\u2019s interpretation of the statutory language to be \u201cunreasonably strained,\u201d and we similarly find nothing in the act that would support such a construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-4\">{\u00b6 20} Pursuant to R.C. 3794.02(A), smoking is prohibited in a \u201cpublic place\u201d or \u201cplace of employment.\u201d The statute defines \u201cplace of employment\u201d in part to mean \u201can enclosed area under the direct or indirect control of an employer,\u201d and the statute further provides that an enclosed area is a place of employment \u201cwithout regard to the time of day or the presence of employees.\u201d R.C. 3794.01(C). The only apparent exception in the act referring to \u201chours of operation\u201d is contained in R.C. 3794.03(A), addressing an exemption for \u201cprivate residences,\u201d which provides that such residences are exempt from the provisions of the act \u201cexcept during the hours of operation as a child care or adult care facility for compensation, * * * or during the hours of operation as a business, when employees of the business, who are not residents of the private residence or are not related to the owner, are present.\u201d Presumably, had the legislature intended an exception for \u201chours of operation\u201d with respect to a private club, it could have provided similar clear language and intent. We further note that appellant\u2019s preferred construction runs contrary to the act\u2019s stated intent that \u201cprovisions of this chapter shall be liberally construed so as to further its purposes of protecting public health.\u201d R.C. 3794.04.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">{\u00b6 21} Based upon the foregoing, we find no abuse of discretion by the trial court in upholding the determinations of the hearing examiner and appellee that appellant failed to satisfy all the requirements for the private-club exemption under R.C. 3794.03(G), as the- Bingo Club is not \u201clocated in a freestanding structure occupied solely by the club.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">{\u00b6 22} We next address the issue raised under appellant\u2019s second assignment of error, in which appellant challenges the trial court\u2019s finding that the Bingo Club is a \u201cplace of employment\u201d under R.C. 3794.02(A). Appellant maintains that the Bingo Club is not a place of employment because it relies upon volunteers and not employees. Appellant argues that the trial court cited no evidence in the record demonstrating actual control wielded by the Bingo Club over volunteers; appellant further argues that the record is devoid of any evidence that provisions of the Bingo Club\u2019s by-laws, pertaining to the association\u2019s control over officers, are actually observed.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">{\u00b6 23} At the outset, we note that the issue of whether the Bingo Club is a place of employment, for purposes of R.C. 3794.02(A), was not challenged by appellant during the administrative hearing. Rather, appellant argued that it was exempt from the SmokeFree Act based upon the applicability of the \u201cprivate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>club\u201d exemption under R.C. 3794.03(G). Further, while appellant did raise, on appeal to the trial court, the issue of whether the Bingo Club had employees, it made that argument in the context of addressing one of the several requirements for the private-club exemption of R.C. 3794.03(G), i.e., the requirement that the club \u201chas no employees.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The trial court, however, appears to have analyzed appellant\u2019s claim of \u201cno employees\u201d as presenting a challenge that the Bingo Club was not a \u201cplace of employment\u201d under R.C. 3794.02(A). As such, the court addressed an issue arguably not before it, and appellant now raises, as assigned error, an issue it did not contest at the administrative level.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">{\u00b6 24} Even assuming that appellant had asserted, during the administrative proceedings, that the Bingo Club was not a place of employment due to lack of employees, we find no error with the trial court\u2019s determination that employees were utilized by appellant. Pursuant to R.C. 3794.01(C), the term \u201cplace of employment\u201d is defined as \u201can enclosed area under the direct or indirect control of an employer that the employer\u2019s employees use for work or any other purpose, including but not limited to, offices, meeting rooms, sales, production and storage areas, restrooms, stairways, hallways, warehouses, garages, and vehicles.\u201d The term \u201cemployee\u201d is broadly defined under R.C. 3794.01(D) to mean not only \u201ca person who is employed by an employer, or who contracts with an employer or third person to perform services for an employer,\u201d but to also include one \u201cwho otherwise performs services for an employer for compensation <em>or for no compensation.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) This court, in considering the definition of \u201cemployee\u201d under R.C. 3794.02(D), has previously noted that \u201cthe concept of control, as utilized under master-servant principles, and * * * suggested by the Act\u2019s definition of \u2018place of employment,\u2019 is relevant to the issue of an employer-employee relationship under the Act.\u201d <em>Ohio Licensed Beverage Assn. v. Ohio Dept. of Health, </em>10th Dist. No. 07AP-490, 2007-Ohio-7147, 2007 WL 4564391, \u00b6 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">{\u00b6 25} The findings of fact, as set forth in the hearing examiner\u2019s report, cite testimony by an investigator observing individuals performing duties at the Bingo Club, including selling instant tickets to players, spinning a bingo wheel, and calling out bingo numbers. An investigator spoke with an individual \u201cwho claimed to be the concession manager,\u201d and appellant\u2019s director testified that vendors are present in the space between the boxing school gym and the flea market during bingo hours. The hearing examiner also cited testimony that the bingo operation is conducted by volunteers who \u201canswer to the Bingo Manager, Vicki Davis,\u201d who \u201cdirects what job each volunteer does on a particular evening.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b639-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>{\u00b6 26} The trial court, citing the evidence presented at the administrative hearing, concluded that appellant, in order to accomplish its business of operating a bingo hall, utilized workers (even if deemed volunteers) to accomplish the various tasks, and that appellant exercised control over those workers. The trial court also found that the association\u2019s by-laws, which were introduced into evidence, vested control over the association\u2019s secretary. A review of the administrative record reflects that there was evidence to support the trial court\u2019s determination that \u201cthe volunteers and others are employees of appellant,\u201d and we find unpersuasive appellant\u2019s contention that this court should reverse that portion of the trial court\u2019s decision finding that \u201cR.C. 3794.02(A) is applicable to prohibit smoking on the premises.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b639-4\">{\u00b6 27} In addition to the hearing examiner\u2019s determination that the facility in which the Bingo Club operates is not located in a freestanding structure occupied solely by the club, the hearing examiner\u2019s report contains unchallenged findings that investigators observed ashtrays throughout the bingo hall and that bingo players were smoking. Based upon the record, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the order of appellee, finding appellant in violation of provisions of the SmokeFree Act, was supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence, and was in accordance with law.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">{\u00b6 28} Accordingly, appellant\u2019s first, second, and third assignments of error are without merit and are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">{\u00b6 29} Under its fourth assignment of error, appellant contends that the trial court erred in failing to find a due-process violation. Specifically, appellant argues that it requested an administrative hearing following notice of the second violation; however, prior to setting a hearing on the second violation, appellee issued a third notice of violation, and subsequently set a hearing on both the second and third violations. Appellant notes that the hearing on both violations took place approximately four months after its initial request for an administrative hearing. Appellant argues that the failure of appellee to hold separate hearings between the time of the second violation and the third violation constituted a denial of due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">{\u00b6 30} In addressing appellant\u2019s due-process argument, the trial court noted that R.C. Chapter 3794 does not set forth any fixed deadlines for the time of a hearing regarding smoking violations, and the court determined that the approximately four-month period of time between the request and the hearing on the violation was not unduly lengthy and did not result in a per se denial of appellant\u2019s due-process rights. The trial court also found nothing in the relevant statutes or regulations requiring appellee to have conducted a hearing on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>second violation prior to issuing the notice of the third violation, the court observing that \u201can unrealistic situation would be created if appellee were foreclosed from investigating and pursuing additional violations for such time as a citation is appealed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">{\u00b6 31} Appellant\u2019s primary argument is that appellee\u2019s delay in holding a hearing subjected it to serious financial risk, as the act provides for progressive fines. However, as noted by the trial court, payment of any fine is not required until after a final finding of violation. See Ohio Adm.Code 3701-52-09(G) (\u201c[u]pon a final finding of violation, the Ohio department of health shall invoice the proprietor or individual for the assessed fines\u201d). We further note that appellant did not, upon receiving the warning letter notifying it of a first finding of violation, attempt to appeal that finding, thus undermining appellant\u2019s contention that administrative delay exposed it to serious financial risk without the opportunity to have its arguments heard. Appellant\u2019s contention that it operated under the good-faith belief that the Bingo Club qualified under the act\u2019s private-club exemption is similarly unconvincing, as R.C. 3794.02(E) provides that \u201c[l]ack of intent to violate a provision of this chapter shall not be a defense to a violation.\u201d Further, as noted by the trial court, nothing contained in the applicable statutes and regulations mandates the resolution of an appeal before further alleged violations may be prosecuted. Upon review, the record shows that appellant was afforded the opportunity to challenge the alleged violations, and we find unpersuasive appellant\u2019s argument that it was denied due process because it was not provided with separate hearings on the second and third proposed violations. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in denying appellant\u2019s due-process claim, and appellant\u2019s fourth assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">{\u00b6 32} Based upon the foregoing, appellant\u2019s first, second, third, and fourth assignments of error are overruled, and the judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b640-8\">Bryant and Sadler, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b638-6\">. The hearing examiner, having determined that the Bingo Club was not located in a freestanding structure occupied solely by the club, concluded that it was not necessary to address the requirement of R.C. 3794.03(G) that the club have no employees.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
