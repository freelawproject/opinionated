Gallagher, Presiding Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">{\u00b6 1} Plaintiffs-appellants, Rebecca Hetzer-Young et al.,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> appeal the decision of the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas that granted summary judgment in favor of (1) defendants-appellees Elano Corporation and Unison Industries, L.L.C., (2) defendants-appellees Lycoming Engines, a.k.a. Textron Lycoming Reciprocating Engine Division; Textron Systems Corporation; Avco Corporation; and Textron, Inc., and (3) defendant-appellee Precision Airmotive L.L.C.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> For the reasons stated herein, we reverse the judgment of the trial court as to Elano Corporation and Unison Industries, L.L.C., we affirm the decision as to the other defendants-appellees, and we remand the matter for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">The Accident</p>\n<p id=\"b554-8\">{\u00b6 2} This case arises from an airplane crash that occurred at the Lawrence County Airport in Chesapeake, Ohio, on March 15, 2005. The aircraft was a Grumman American AA-5. On board was Dr. Michael Young, who was the pilot; his daughter, Ginny Young; and her friend, Charles Lampe. All three on board died.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-9\">{\u00b6 3} According to the National Transportation Safety Board (\u201cNTSB\u201d) factual report, the aircraft crashed shortly after takeoff. Eyewitnesses to the crash observed that Dr. Young made two attempts at landing the airplane. On the first approach, the aircraft appeared too high, and Dr. Young executed a \u201cgo-around\u201d for a second approach. During the second approach, the aircraft appeared to be high, fast, and long down the runway. Engine power was heard being applied, the airplane continued in a \u201cnose high,\u201d \u201csteep climb\u201d position, followed by the right wing dropping, a loss of power, and the plane descending nose first to the ground. A postcrash fire consumed a majority of the main wreckage.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-10\">The Lawsuit</p>\n<p id=\"b554-11\">{\u00b6 4} Appellants, who are representatives of the decedents\u2019 estates, maintain that the crash occurred as a result of a sudden engine failure at low altitude, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>because of a defect and failure in the aircraft\u2019s muffler and the carburetor engine component. They filed this wrongful-death, products-liability action against numerous defendants, including the manufacturer of the aircraft\u2019s muffler, Elano Corporation (\u201cElano\u201d), which later merged into Unison Industries, L.L.C. (collectively, \u201cUnison\u201d); the manufacturer of the aircraft\u2019s engine, Lycoming, and certain companies associated with Lycoming (collectively, \u201cLycoming\u201d);<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the product-line successor to the manufacturer of the carburetor for the engine, Precision Airmotive L.L.C. (\u201cPrecision\u201d);<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> as well as other parties who are not a part of this appeal.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In the complaint, appellants set forth claims for strict liability; negligence; misrepresentation; concert of action; and willful, wanton and outrageous conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">The Aircraft</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">{\u00b6 5} The subject Grumman American AA-5 aircraft had an airworthiness date of July 16, 1974. Grumman American Aviation Corporation (\u201cGrumman\u201d) sold the aircraft to its first purchaser, Firebird Aviation, around August 1974. Shortly thereafter, Firebird Aviation sold the aircraft to Harold L. Wylie. It is undisputed that at the time of the March 2005 accident, the aircraft was more than 30 years old.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">The Muffler</p>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">{\u00b6 6} Elano manufactured the muffler installed on the accident aircraft. The muffler was marked with the date code \u201c04-74,\u201d demonstrating that it was manufactured by Elano in April 1974. Elano later merged into Unison.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>{\u00b6 7} The engine logbook for the aircraft contains an entry dated August 28, 1987, that states \u201creplaced muffler,\u201d which was entered by Edward Ramsey, an FAA-licensed airframe and powerplant (\u201cA &amp; P\u201d) mechanic. Appellants, through their experts, maintain that the logbook entry establishes that the original muffler was replaced with a new muffler. Appellants\u2019 theory of liability is that the aircraft experienced a sudden loss of engine power when the muffler\u2019s flame tube separated and blocked the exhaust.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">{\u00b6 8} Unison challenges the admissibility of the engine-logbook entry and claims that the evidence is insufficient to establish that a new muffler was installed in 1987.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">The Engine and the Carburetor</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">{\u00b6 9} The aircraft engine was manufactured by Lycoming. Lycoming obtained a \u201ctype certificate\u201d from the Federal Aviation Administration (\u201cFAA\u201d) through a certification process that is intended to make sure that the aircraft meets the minimum standards for performance and safety set forth by the FAA.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">{\u00b6 10} Federal aviation regulations require that \u201c[t]he fuel system of the engine must be designed and constructed to supply an appropriate mixture of fuel to the cylinders throughout the complete operating range of the engine under all flight and atmospheric conditions.\u201d 14 C.F.R. 33.35(a). Lycoming conceded that \u201c[f]or maintaining the flow limits on a particular carburetor as it is installed in the engine, that is our responsibility.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b556-8\">{\u00b6 11} The aircraft\u2019s engine was equipped with a Marvel-Shebler model MA-4SPA carburetor that was manufactured on or about February 22, 1974. The carburetor is a component of the engine. The primary function of the carburetor is to deliver the appropriate fuel/air mixture to the engine. The product line was eventually sold to Precision.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-9\">{\u00b6 12} The Lycoming engine, including the carburetor component, was shipped to Grumman on April 26, 1974, and thereafter was installed on the subject aircraft. The original engine and carburetor remained on the aircraft until the 2005 crash.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-10\">The Float and the Open-Cell Defect</p>\n<p id=\"b556-11\">{\u00b6 13} The carburetor utilizes a float to help maintain the correct fuel level for delivery to the engine. The float on the subject aircraft was a Rogers composite Nitrophyl float.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-12\">{\u00b6 14} When Marvel-Shebler began manufacturing the carburetor in the 1930s, the floats were made out of metal. By 1961, the floats were being made out of composite materials.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>{\u00b6 15} In the late 1970s, Marvel-Shebler began receiving reports that some composite floats were absorbing fluid. This resulted in the floats becoming less buoyant and sinking, thus affecting the carburetor\u2019s ability to control fuel flow.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">{\u00b6 16} After Facet acquired the MA-series carburetor product line, Facet issued service bulletins in April and May 1984, indicating that composite floats could absorb fuel and directing aircraft owners to replace the composite floats with metal floats. The same year, Facet asked the FAA to issue an airworthiness directive (\u201cAD\u201d) requiring aircraft owners to replace composite floats with metal floats.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">{\u00b6 17} In response, the FAA issued a \u201cnotice of proposed rule making\u201d that proposed the adoption of a new AD that would require the replacement of all composite floats with metal floats on all Facet (Marvel-Shebler) model carburetors. 49 F.R. 33694, effective August 24, 1984. The FAA expressed that \u201c[t]he proposed AD is needed to prevent fuel absorption of the composite floats that causes an unsafe weight increase affecting fuel flow which could result in engine start fires or inflight engine stoppage.\u201d Id. The FAA sought comments from the manufacturers on the proposed AD.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">{\u00b6 18} Appellants maintain that Lycoming and Marvel-Shebler/Facet discovered that the float-saturation problem was occurring due to an \u201copen-cell\u201d defect in the composite floats. Appellants claim that Lycoming and Facet misrepresented to the FAA that the reason for the float-saturation problem was the improper use of automotive fuels and concealed their knowledge that the composite floats suffered from an open-cell defect. The FAA withdrew the proposed AD on April 15,1985. 50 F.R. 14716, effective April 15,1985.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">{\u00b6 19} In February 1990, an Alaska Superior Court judge found by clear and convincing evidence that Facet knew that some Model Nos. 30-628 and 30-759 Rogers composite floats contained an open-cell structure and that despite a lack of substantiating evidence, Facet represented to the FAA that auto gas had an adverse affect on the Rogers composite float. See <em>Palmer v. Borg-Warner Corp. </em>(Alaska 1992), 838 P.2d 1243, 1246. Lycoming was a party to that lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-9\">{\u00b6 20} In 1990, Facet again requested the FAA for an AD mandating the replacement of the composite floats with metal floats. Facet continued to represent that it believed the saturation of the composite floats was due to the \u201cuse of low lead fuels and autogas\u201d and also indicated that \u201cthere may be other causes for float saturation.\u201d This time, Lycoming supported the issuance of the AD. Neither Facet nor Lycoming disclosed an open-cell defect to the FAA. Further, Precision, after it acquired the MA-series carburetor product line from Facet, requested the FAA for an AD on September 5, 1991, but did not report an open-cell defect.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>{\u00b6 21} Despite the requests to the FAA and the FAA\u2019s awareness that the composite floats were absorbing fuel, the FAA declined to issue an AD. In a letter to Precision dated July 8, 1992, the FAA concluded that \u201cthere was not a significant difference in the problems associated with the composite or metal floats and that regulatory action was not warranted at this time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">{\u00b6 22} The composite float on the subject aircraft was never replaced. Appellants\u2019 theory is that the float was one of the defective open-cell floats and that it was a cause of the engine failure and accident. Appellants maintain that had the FAA issued the proposed AD, the float on the subject aircraft would have been removed long before the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">Summary Judgment and GARA</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">{\u00b6 23} Unison, Lycoming, and Precision all filed motions for summary judgment, asserting that appellants\u2019 claims against them were barred by the federal statute of repose under the General Aviation Revitalization Act of 1994, 49 U.S.C. 40101 (\u201cGARA\u201d). The trial court granted the motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">(\u00b6 24} GARA is \u201can 18 year statute of repose for a civil action against an aircraft manufacturer for damages arising out of an accident involving a general aviation aircraft.\u201d H.R.Rep. No. 103-525 (1994), Part I, Pages 1-4, reprinted in 1994 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1638. GARA was enacted in response to a decline in the nation\u2019s general aviation aircraft manufacturing industry and was an attempt to revitalize the industry. Id. An important cause of the decline was attributed to the industry\u2019s increasing product-liability costs. Id. Thus, GARA was designed to limit excessive product-liability costs and to protect manufacturers from the long tail of liability, while at the same time affording fair treatment to persons injured in general aviation aircraft accidents. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">{\u00b6 25} GARA provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-9\">Sec. 2. Time limitations on civil actions against aircraft manufacturers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-10\">(a) In general. Except as provided in subsection (b), no civil action for damages for death or injury to persons or damage to property arising out of an accident involving a general aviation aircraft may be brought against the manufacturer of the aircraft or the manufacturer of any new component, system, subassembly, or other part of the aircraft, in its capacity as a manufacturer if the accident occurred\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-11\">(1) after the applicable limitation period [18 years] beginning on\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-12\">(A) the date of delivery of the aircraft to its first purchaser or lessee, if delivered directly from the manufacturer; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-13\">(B) the date of first delivery of the aircraft to a person engaged in the business of selling or leasing such aircraft; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>(2) with respect to any new component, system, subassembly, or other part which replaced another component, system, subassembly, or other part originally in, or which was added to, the aircraft, and which is alleged to have caused such death, injury, or damage, after the applicable limitation period [18 years] beginning on the date of completion of the replacement or addition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ACT\">GARA 2(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">{\u00b6 26} There are also several exceptions for which the above statute of repose does not apply, including the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-6\">(1) if the claimant pleads with specificity the facts necessary to prove, and proves, that the manufacturer with respect to a type certificate or airworthiness certificate for, or obligations with respect to continuing airworthiness of, an aircraft or a component, system, subassembly, or other part of an aircraft knowingly misrepresented to the Federal Aviation Administration, or concealed or withheld from the Federal Aviation Administration, required information that is material and relevant to the performance or the maintenance or operation of such aircraft, or the component, system, subassembly, or other part, that is causally related to the harm which the claimant allegedly suffered.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A7m\">GARA 2(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">The Appeal and Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">{\u00b6 27} Appellants have appealed the trial court\u2019s decision and have raised three assignments of error for our review, challenging the trial court\u2019s ruling on each of the motions for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-9\">{\u00b6 28} Appellate review of summary judgment is de novo. <em>Grafton v. Ohio Edison Co. </em>(1996), 77 Ohio St.3d 102, 105, 671 N.E.2d 241. Summary judgment is proper when the moving party establishes that \u201c(1) no genuine issue of any material fact remains, (2) the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and (3) it appears from the evidence that reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion, and construing the evidence most strongly in favor of the nonmoving party, that conclusion is adverse to the party against whom the motion for summary judgment is made.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Duncan v. Mentor City Council, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 372, 2005-Ohio-2163, 826 N.E.2d 832, \u00b6 9, citing <em>Temple v. Wean United, Inc. </em>(1977), 50 Ohio St.2d 317, 327, 4 O.O.3d 466, 364 N.E.2d 267; Civ.R. 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-10\">{\u00b6 29} Once a moving party satisfies its burden of supporting its motion for summary judgment with sufficient and acceptable evidence pursuant to Civ.R. 56(C), the burden shifts to the nonmoving party to set forth specific facts showing a genuine issue of material fact. <em>Todd Dev. Co., Inc. v. Morgan, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 461, 2008-Ohio-87, 880 N.E.2d 88, \u00b6 12; Civ.R. 56(E). \u201cThe language of Civ.R. 56 and our case law do not support the proposition that a party moving for summary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>judgment has the burden to prove its case and disprove the opposing party\u2019s case as well.\u201d <em>Todd </em>at \u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">First Assignment of Error \u2014 Unison\u2019s Motion</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">{\u00b6 30} Appellants argue that the trial court erred in granting Unison\u2019s motion for summary judgment under GARA.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">{\u00b6 31} GARA bars actions against the manufacturer of an aircraft if the accident occurred 18 years after delivery to the first purchaser or lessee, or after the date of first delivery to a person engaged in the business of selling or leasing the aircraft. GARA 2(a)(1)(A) and (B). This, however, is subject to GARA\u2019s \u201crolling provision\u201d that triggers a new 18-year period with respect to \u201cany new component, system, subassembly, or other part which replaced another component * * * or other part originally in, or which was added to the aircraft, and which is alleged to have caused such death, injury, or damage * * *.\u201d GARA 2(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">{\u00b6 32} GARA acts as an affirmative defense and \u201ccreates an explicit statutory right not to stand trial.\u201d <em>Blazevska v. Raytheon Aircraft Co. </em>(C.A.9, 2008), 522 F.3d 948, 951. The party who raises an affirmative defense bears the burden of proving the defense. See <em>Todd Dev. Co., Inc., </em>116 Ohio St.3d 461, 2008-Ohio-87, 880 N.E.2d 88, \u00b6 18-21; <em>N. Shore Auto Financing, Inc. v. Block, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 82226, 2003-Ohio-3964, 2003 WL 21714583.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-9\">{\u00b6 33} The muffler installed on the accident aircraft bore a date stamp of \u201c04-74,\u201d evidencing that it was manufactured by Elano in 1974. In 1974, Elano sold mufflers only to airframe manufacturers, such as Grumman, but it did not sell mufflers as replacement parts to end-users, such as pilots or aircraft service facilities. There is no dispute that the subject aircraft was delivered to its first purchaser in 1974 and was more than 30 years old at the time of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-10\">{\u00b6 34} Appellants argue that Unison was required to prove that the muffler on the accident aircraft was the original muffler in order to be entitled to GARA\u2019s first repose period. We are unpersuaded by this argument. Courts have recognized that GARA generally bars lawsuits that are brought against aircraft manufacturers more than 18 years after the delivery date to an initial purchaser of the aircraft. See <em>Burton v. Twin Commander Aircraft, L.L.C. </em>(2009), 148 Wash.App. 606, 221 P.3d 290; <em>Robinson v. Hartzell Propeller, Inc. </em>(C.A.3, 2006), 454 F.3d 163, 165; <em>Blazevska, </em>522 F.3d 948, 952. Thus, insofar as appellants\u2019 action is based on a claim that any original components or systems failed, Unison has established that those claims would be barred by GARA 2(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>{\u00b6 35} However, GARA would not necessarily bar an action based on the failure of a replacement component or system. See GARA 2(a)(2). Therefore, to the extent that appellants claim that a new replacement part caused the accident, they have the burden of showing that the general repose period was restarted by GARA\u2019s rolling provision. See <em>Willett v. Cessna Aircraft Co. </em>(2006), 366 Ill. App.3d 360, 371-372, 303 Ill.Dec. 439, 851 N.E.2d 626. Unison was not required to prove its case and disprove the opposing party\u2019s case as well. See <em>Todd Dev. Co., Inc., </em>116 Ohio St.3d 461, 2008-Ohio-87, 880 N.E.2d 88, \u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\">{\u00b6 36} In support of their argument that the muffler on the accident aircraft was not the original muffler, but was a new replacement part, appellants rely upon an entry in the aircraft\u2019s engine logbook, dated August 28, 1987, indicating \u201creplaced muffler.\u201d They claim that the logbook entry is admissible evidence under either the business-records exception or the ancient-document exception to the hearsay rule. See Evid.R. 803(6); Evid.R. 803(16).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">{\u00b6 37} The Ohio Supreme Court has set forth the business-record exception as follows: \u201c \u2018To qualify for admission under Rule 803(6), a business record must manifest four essential elements: (i) the record must be one regularly recorded in a regularly conducted activity; (ii) it must have been entered by a person with knowledge of the act, event or condition; (iii) it must have been recorded at or near the time of the transaction; and (iv) a foundation must be laid by the \u201ccustodian\u201d of the record or by some \u201cother qualified witness.\u201d \u2019 Weissenberger, Ohio Evidence Treatise (2007) 600, Section 803.73. Even after these elements are established, however, a business record may be excluded from evidence if \u2018the source of information or the method or circumstances of preparation indicate lack of trustworthiness.\u2019 Evid.R. 803(6).\u201d <em>State v. Davis, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 404, 2008-Ohio-2, 880 N.E.2d 31, \u00b6 171.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">{\u00b6 38} As to the first element, appellants presented evidence that the record was regularly recorded in a regularly conducted activity. Federal aviation regulations require an aircraft owner to keep and maintain engine-maintenance records and to transfer the records with the aircraft when sold. 14 C.F.R. 91.417 and 91.419. Paul Beegle, an FAA-licensed A &amp; P mechanic, states in his affidavit that the system of recordkeeping in aircraft-engine logbooks, as controlled by federal regulations, is \u201cstandard across the aviation industry in the United States.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">{\u00b6 39} Beegle provided maintenance and conducted inspections, including annual inspections, on the subject aircraft between 1975 and 1994, and as a regular business practice, he made entries in the logbook for the work he performed. He stated that he recognized the logbook attached to his affidavit as \u201ca true and correct copy\u201d of \u201cthe same engine logbook\u201d in which he made his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>maintenance entries. The engine logbook contained regular entries from July 16, 1974, to November 1, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">{\u00b6 40} As to the second element, appellants presented evidence that the logbook entry was entered by a person with knowledge of the act, event, or condition. The logbook entry was dated August 28, 1987, and was entered by Ed Ramsey, an A <em>&amp; </em>P mechanic. Beegle stated in his affidavit that he was familiar with Ramsey and had worked with him for a number of years. He recognized Ramsey\u2019s handwriting on the logbook entry that stated \u201creplaced muffler.\u201d Beegle also verified work performed when he signed off on the aircraft\u2019s annual inspection later that same month.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">{\u00b6 41} As to the third element, recorded at or near the time of the transaction, Beegle attested to making entries in the logbook \u201cright after such work was performed.\u201d A review of the logbook itself reflects that the dates of the entries are consistent with the work performed.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">{\u00b6 42} As to the fourth element, appellants presented a qualified witness to establish a proper foundation for the logbook entry. With respect to this element, the testifying witness must possess a working knowledge of the specific recordkeeping system that produced the document. See <em>State v. Davis </em>(1991), 62 Ohio St.3d 326, 342, 581 N.E.2d 1362. Contrary to Unison\u2019s argument, the \u201cqualified witness\u201d was not required to have personal knowledge of the logbook entry. See <em>Robinson v. Hartzell Propeller Inc. </em>(E.D.Pa.2004), 326 F.Supp.2d 631, 664, fn. 18 (recognizing that an \u201cother qualified witness\u201d who has familiarity with the recordkeeping system may testify to the foundational requirements). In <em>Davis, </em>the Ohio Supreme Court observed as follows: \u201c \u2018While the witness need not have personal knowledge of the creation of the particular record in question, and need not have been in the employ of the company at the time the record was made, * * * he must be able to vouch from personal knowledge of the record-keeping system that such records were kept in the regular course of business.\u2019 \u201d <em>Davis </em>at 342, quoting <em>Dell Publishing Co., Inc. v. Whedon </em>(S.D.N.Y.1984), 577 F.Supp. 1459, 1464, fn. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">{\u00b6 43} Here, Beegle attested to the standardized recordkeeping requirements for the engine logbook; he personally maintained the accident aircraft between 1975 and 1994; he made entries in the engine logbook; he was familiar with the mechanic who made the specific entry in question; and he verified the work performed. Thus, Beegle was a qualified witness with a working knowledge of the specific recordkeeping system that produced the entry in question and could attest to the foundational requirements of Evid.R. 803(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">{\u00b6 44} With respect to the trustworthiness of these records, pursuant to federal aviation regulations, mechanics are not only required to make entries in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>maintenance records, but they are also prohibited from making false entries. 14 C.F.R. 43.9(a), 43.12(a)(1). Beegle indicated that because the recordkeeping system is standard in the industry and A <em>&amp; </em>P mechanics are governed by the same federal aviation regulations, \u201cany mechanic performing maintenance on an aircraft engine is able to accurately surmise any and all prior work performed on the engine, even if another mechanic performed such work.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">{\u00b6 45} Nevertheless, Unison argues that the logbook is untrustworthy because a number of the logbooks are missing and the manner in which the subject logbook appeared casts doubt on its trustworthiness.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">{\u00b6 46} Hetzer-Young testified at her deposition that while she was at her condo grieving, with numerous people surrounding her, including state policemen, a suitcase was located for her, and she was told that the FAA would be asking for it. Even though Hetzer-Young did not know who handed her the suitcase, there is nothing in the record to suggest that the logbook entry was fabricated. Further, Beegle, who is familiar with the engine logbook, is a \u201cqualified witness\u201d who can provide a sufficient foundation upon which to establish the trustworthiness of the subject entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">{\u00b6 47} Unison claims that because the engine logbook from November 1, 2002, to the date of the accident is missing, there is no way of knowing whether the \u201creplaced muffler\u201d was the same muffler on the aircraft at the time of the accident.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Ironically, this argument apparently would support appellants\u2019 position that the muffler on the accident aircraft was not an original component part.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">{\u00b6 48} Nevertheless, appellants presented evidence that there were no further muffler replacements. Nelson Witt, president of Attitude Aviation, testified at his deposition that his company performed maintenance on the subject aircraft from the day Dr. Young first brought the aircraft to the Lawrence County Airpark in 2004 until the day of the crash. He was not aware of any other maintenance being performed on the aircraft. He testified that Attitude Aviation never replaced the muffler, or even \u201cworked on the exhaust system at all.\u201d He further testified that Attitude Aviation would have made entries in the aircraft\u2019s logbooks in connection with the work they performed and that the mechanics place logbooks back on the aircraft. There is no dispute that Dr. Young\u2019s aircraft caught fire after the crash.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-9\">{\u00b6 49} Upon our review, we find that sufficient evidence exists to establish the admissibility of the logbook entry under the business-record exception to the hearsay rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>{\u00b6 50} Appellants also claim that the logbook entry is admissible under the ancient-document exception to the hearsay rule. This exception provides that \u201c[statements in a document in existence twenty years or more the authenticity of which is established\u201d are not excluded by the hearsay rule. Evid.R. 803(16). The requirement of authentication is satisfied \u201cby evidence sufficient to support a finding that the matter in question is what its proponent claims.\u201d Evid.R. 901(A). By way of illustration only, an ancient document may be authenticated by evidence that a document \u201c(a) is in such condition as to create no suspicion concerning its authenticity, (b) was in a place where it, if authentic, would likely be, and (c) has been in existence twenty years or more at the time it is offered.\u201d Evid.R. 901(B)(8).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">{\u00b6 51} Here, the engine logbook has been in existence since 1974, and the 1987 logbook entry was in existence for more than 20 years at the time it was offered as evidence. It appears from the deposition testimony of Hetzer-Young that the logbook was located at Dr. Young\u2019s home following the accident and was handed to her in a suitcase with other aircraft documents. She specifically testified that the suitcase was \u201cin my condo somewhere because they located it.\u201d The documents were forwarded to her attorney, who attested to making copies of the engine logbook. The engine logbook contained regular entries over a certain time period. It was readily identifiable as the aircraft\u2019s engine logbook through the testimony of Beegle, who was familiar with his entries and with the handwriting of Ramsey, who made the \u201creplaced muffler\u201d entry. We find that sufficient evidence exists to establish that the logbook entry is admissible as an ancient document.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">{\u00b6 52} Notwithstanding the admissibility of the logbook entry, Unison argues that the logbook entry is insufficient to show that a \u201cnew\u201d 1974 muffler was installed on the aircraft in 1987. Unison claims that the affidavits submitted by appellants speculate as to the meaning of the entry. We are unpersuaded by this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">{\u00b6 53} Appellants did not ask their experts to speculate about the meaning of the entry, but rather, they asked their experts what the entry indicated based on industry standards. Beegle explained that engine-logbook entries are nationally standardized and regulated so that each mechanic can ascertain precisely what work was performed by prior mechanics. He stated that the August 28, 1987 entry clearly indicates that the muffler was replaced with a new muffler and that under industry practice, a used muffler would not be replaced with a used muffler. He further indicated that if the muffler was not new, the entry would so reflect and a yellow tag would be required. Appellants also provided affidavits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>from several other A &amp; P mechanics<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> who stated, for the same or similar reasons, that the logbook entry indicated that a new muffler was put on the aircraft on August 28, 1987. Through these experts, appellants offered proof of the logbook entry\u2019s generally accepted meaning in the aviation industry. Appellants also offered evidence that although Elano sold mufflers only to airframe manufacturers, the airframe manufacturers distributed them as replacement parts, and the parts often would sit on shelves in inventory for years.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">{\u00b6 54} We find that appellants presented sufficient evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude that it is more likely than not that the muffler found on the accident aircraft, which is alleged to have caused the accident, was installed as a new replacement part in August 1987.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">{\u00b6 55} Because genuine issues of material fact exist, the resolution of which may trigger GARA\u2019s rolling provision, Unison is not entitled to judgment as a matter of law. We express no opinion on the issue of proximate cause, as this issue was not before the trial court with respect to Unison\u2019s motion.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Appellants\u2019 first assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">Second and Third Assignments of Error \u2014 Lycoming\u2019s Motion and Precision\u2019s Motion</p>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">{\u00b6 56} Appellants argue that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Lycoming and Precision.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-9\">{\u00b6 57} The original engine and carburetor remained on the aircraft until the 2005 crash. Because the accident occurred 18 years after delivery of the aircraft to its first purchaser, appellants\u2019 claims against Lycoming and Precision are barred under GARA unless appellants are able to prove that a GARA exception applies. The relevant exception to the 18-year statute of repose applies when the manufacturer knowingly misrepresented, concealed, or withheld required information from the FAA that is material and relevant to the operation of the aircraft and is causally related to the accident. GARA 2(b)(1). Insofar as appellants contend that Precision was not a \u201cmanufacturer\u201d of original equipment on the aircraft, the term \u201cmanufacturer\u201d used in GARA has been applied to product-line successors. See <em>Mason v. Schweizer Aircraft Corp. </em>(Iowa 2002), 653 N.W.2d 543; <em>Burroughs v. Precision Airmotive Corp. </em>(2000), 78 Cal.App.4th 681, 93 Cal.Rptr.2d 124 (finding that under GARA, a product-line successor \u201cstands in the shoes of\u2019 its product-line predecessors).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>{\u00b6 58} To establish the above exception, appellants must show \u201c(1) knowing misrepresentation, or concealment, or withholding of material and relevant information, (2) that the manufacturer is required to give the FAA, (3) that is causally related to the accident.\u201d <em>Burton, </em>148 Wash.App. 606, 221 P.3d 290; <em>Robinson, </em>326 F.Supp.2d at 647.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">{\u00b6 59} The first requirement to the exception requires evidence that Lycoming and Precision \u201cknowingly misrepresented, or concealed, or withheld\u201d material and relevant information from the FAA. \u201cKnowingly\u201d is defined as \u201c[w]ith knowledge; consciously; intelligently; willfully; intentionally.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (5th Ed.1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">{\u00b6 60} The evidence in this case shows that the float-saturation problem was disclosed to the FAA and the FAA was aware that composite floats could absorb fuel and sink. However, appellants maintain that the cause of the float-saturation problem was misrepresented to the FAA as improper use of automotive fuels and that appellees concealed or withheld from the FAA their knowledge of an open-cell defect in the composite floats that was the actual source of the problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">{\u00b6 61} Appellants presented exhibits showing that Marvel-Shebler/Facet discovered in the late 1970s that the float-saturation problem was occurring because of an \u201copen-cell\u201d structure in composite floats. While two of these exhibits pertain to polyurethane composite floats made by Sheridan Corporation, these exhibits nonetheless demonstrate an open-cell structure being a source of the fuel-absorption problem with certain composite floats. Further, the third exhibit specifically relates to Rogers composite floats. In that document, it was revealed that the cause of failed floats was \u201can open-cell structure\u201d that caused the floats to absorb fuel, and was not because of any kind of chemical attack on their surface. While it was represented that the number of float failures was an extremely small percentage, it also was recognized that \u201ctheir economic impact can be high because of product liability in the aviation carburetor application, particularly if the failures represent a trend.\u201d It was concluded that enhanced quality-control measures \u201cshould be sufficient to obtain zero defects,\u201d and as a result, \u201c[t]here is no need to change this float in the M-S/T carburetors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">{\u00b6 62} As further evidence that Lycoming and Precision were aware that the Rogers composite floats were defective, appellants point to the 1990 Alaska Superior Court case in which the court determined that Facet had knowledge that Rogers composite floats contained an open-cell structure and that Facet had represented to the FAA that automotive fuel was the source of the problem, despite the fact that none of the tests conducted by Facet substantiated this determination. See <em>Palmer, </em>838 P.2d at 1246 (quoting Alaska Superior Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>decision). Lycoming was a party to the litigation. See <em>Borg-Warner Corp. v. Avco Corp. (Lycoming Div.) </em>(Alaska 1993), 850 P.2d 628.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\">{\u00b6 63} Appellants assert that despite their knowledge of an open-cell defect being the cause of the problem with the composite floats, Lycoming and Facet did not disclose the defect to the FAA and continued to misrepresent to the FAA that automotive fuel was the source of the problem. They further state that Precision was made aware of the problem when it purchased the MA-Series carburetor product line in 1990 from Facet, because Precision would have acquired the report discussing the open-cell structure and Facet disclosed to Precision \u201call the significant information regarding\u201d the composite floats.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">{\u00b6 64} Brian Whitfield, who was involved in Precision\u2019s acquisition of the product line, testified that Facet told him that the \u201conly problem\u201d with the product line was \u201cthe float.\u201d Whitfield also testified that Precision had serious concerns about going forward with purchasing the product line \u201cbecause of the Alaska float problem.\u201d The evidence reflects that Precision joined in the petitioning to the FAA to issue the AD, but did not disclose an open-cell defect. Precision also issued a service bulletin that was provided to the FAA that indicated that \u201ccomposite floats may be absorbing fluid and sinking,\u201d but it did not disclose an open-cell defect in the float.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">{\u00b6 65} The cases relied upon by Lycoming and Precision to suggest that appellants have failed to demonstrate a knowing misrepresentation or concealment in this matter are clearly distinguishable, because in those cases there was no evidence that the manufacturer knowingly misrepresented, concealed, or withheld material and relevant information from the FAA. See <em>Cartman v. Textron Lycoming Reciprocating Engine Div. </em>(Feb. 27, 1996), E.D. Mich. No. CY-72582-DT, 1996 WL 316575 (there was no proof that Rogers, as the supplier of the composite float, had communicated anything to the FAA or had a duty to do so, as Rogers was not a type certificate holder or a parts manufacturer approval (\u201cPMA\u201d) holder); <em>Sheesley v. Cessna Aircraft Co. </em>(Apr. 20, 2006), D.S.D. No. 02-4185-KES, 2006 WL 1084103 (although Cessna may have disagreed with the FAA on how to solve the exhaust-system failure, the evidence showed that the exhaust-system problems were disclosed to the FAA); <em>Rickert v. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. </em>(D.Wyo.1996), 923 F.Supp. 1453 (the facts indicated only a \u201cdifference of opinion\u201d concerning proper design, and no specific facts were proffered to show that Mitsubishi knowingly misrepresented the aircraft\u2019s controllability characteristics to the FAA); <em>Moyer v. Teledyne Continental Motors, Inc. </em>(Pa.Super.2009), 979 A.2d 336, 346 (the court found that \u201ca single inadequate test prior to approving welding as an acceptable crankcase repair method * * * would not create a reasonable inference [that the defendant] knew * * * that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>welding of crankcases was not an acceptable repair process such that it misrepresented or attempted to conceal such information from the FAA\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">{\u00b6 66} In the <em>Rickert </em>case, following remand, the court reversed its earlier decision and denied summary judgment after the plaintiff presented new evidence \u2014 affidavits asserting that the defendant deliberately kept problems with the de-icing system from the FAA. <em>Rickert v. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. </em>(D.Wyo.1996), 929 F.Supp. 380. In <em>Moyer, </em>which was filed as supplemental authority herein, the court referred to <em>Burton, </em>148 Wash.App. 606, 221 P.3d 290, wherein material issues of fact were created regarding the GAEA exception where statements made in two e-mails issued by the vice president/general manager of the appellee Twin Commander evinced that Twin Commander misrepresented or concealed the extent of the structural problems of the rudder system in an aircraft that had crashed and withheld critical information about that rudder system.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">{\u00b6 67} Likewise, in <em>Robinson, </em>326 F.Supp.2d at 659, the court found that evidence submitted by the plaintiffs created a genuine issue of material fact as to whether a knowing misrepresentation or concealment was made in communications with the FAA regarding the actual cause of numerous propeller failures. The plaintiffs in <em>Robinson </em>maintained that Hartzell concealed the source of the high damaging vibratory stresses, which caused propeller failures, and blamed other factors. The <em>Robinson </em>court rejected the defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>Rickert </em>and found that \u201c[although this Court agrees that 14 C.F.R. \u00a7 21.3 does not require a manufacturer to report \u2018all differences of opinion,\u2019 this regulation requires a type certificate holder to report failures, investigate failures, and report design defects to the FAA.\u201d <em>Robinson </em>at 658.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">{\u00b6 68} We find that the evidence in this case is sufficient to demonstrate more than a mere \u201cdifference of opinion\u201d as to the cause of the float-saturation problem. Appellants presented evidence that Lycoming and Precision were aware that an open-cell structure was the cause of the problem, not automotive fuel; that representations were made to the FAA that automotive fuel was the source of the problem; and that an open-cell defect was not disclosed to the FAA. Under these circumstances, we conclude that the evidence is sufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Lycoming and Precision knowingly misrepresented, concealed, or withheld the actual cause of the float-saturation problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">{\u00b6 69} To meet the second requirement of the exception, appellants must show that the open-cell defect was information required to be submitted to the FAA. Appellants argue that Lycoming, as the engine\u2019s type certificate holder, and Precision, as a parts manufacturer approval (\u201cPMA\u201d) holder for the carburetor, both had a duty to report their knowledge of the defect under 14 C.F.R. 21.3. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>This section places an affirmative obligation on such parties to \u201creport any failure, malfunction, or defect in any product, part, process, or article manufactured by it that it determines has resulted in any of the occurrences listed in paragraph (C) of this section.\u201d Id. Additionally, appellants argue that Precision is obligated to report defects to the FAA as a certified repair station pursuant to 14 C.F.R. 145.221. See <em>Long v. Muncie Aviation Co. </em>(Dec. 5, 2008), Ill.Cir.Ct. No. 06 L 006992, at 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\">{\u00b6 70} Precision contends that it had no duty to disclose its knowledge of the defect because the float was not \u201cmanufactured by it\u201d and Precision never made the \u201cdetermination\u201d described in 14 C.F.R. 21.3. Lycoming makes a similar argument. We find no merit to their position. As found in <em>Burroughs:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-5\">Precision, as the holder of the PMA on the Marvel-Schebler line of carburetors, was obliged to comply with these reporting requirements even though technically the particular model of carburetor in question here was not \u201cmanufactured by it.\u201d * * * Again, after Precision took over the Marvel-Schebler carburetor line in 1990, * * * [i]n the eyes of the FAA, Precision was the \u201cnew manufacturer\u201d of the Marvel-Schebler carburetor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">78 Cal.App.4th at 693, 93 Cal.Rptr.2d 124.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">{\u00b6 71} The reporting obligations under 14 C.F.R. 21.3 are broad and include an affirmative duty \u201cto report failures, investigate failures, and report design defects to the FAA.\u201d See <em>Robinson, </em>326 F.Supp.2d at 657; see also <em>Burton, </em>148 Wash.App. 606, 221 P.3d 290. Furthermore, \u201cthe reporting obligation is ongoing and continuous.\u201d <em>Long, </em>Ill.Cir.Ct. No. 06 L 006992. As a matter of federal policy, \u201cthe FAA cannot fulfill its obligation to promote civil aircraft safety if information which may be highly relevant to safety is withheld in the first instance.\u201d <em>Butler v. Bell Helicopter Textron </em>(2003), 109 Cal.App.4th 1073, 1086, 135 Cal.Rptr.2d 762. Thus, the reporting requirements under 14 C.F.R. 21.3 impose a responsibility not only to report failures, but also to investigate failures and report to the FAA design defects that detract from flight safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">{\u00b6 72} In this ease, we find that any knowing misrepresentation, concealment, or withholding of information regarding the cause of the float-saturation problem and the open-cell defect involves information required to be disclosed to the FAA.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-9\">{\u00b6 73} To meet the third requirement of the GARA exception, appellants are required to show that any alleged misrepresentation or concealment was causally related to the accident. Appellants maintain that had the FAA been informed that the source of the float-saturation problem was not the improper use of automotive fuel, and had the open-cell defect been disclosed as the actual source of the problem, the FAA would have issued the AD requiring the removal of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>composite floats from MA-series carburetors, which AD would have had the force of law and the aircraft could never have been approved for return to service after any annual inspection. See 14 C.F.R. 39.13, 43.11(a)(5). Appellants\u2019 theory is that the Rogers composite Nitrophyl float in the aircraft\u2019s carburetor was one of the defective open-cell floats and that it became saturated with fuel and sank, thus causing the engine failure and accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">{\u00b6 74} Lycoming and Precision argue that there is no evidence that the FAA would have issued such an AD or that it would have been complied with. In declining to issue the AD, the FAA found no significant difference in the problems associated with composite and metal floats. Lycoming also states that service instructions for the carburetor required an overhaul every ten years, and any mechanic performing an overhaul after 1984 should have removed the 1974 composite float as required by the mandatory service bulletins. Finally, Lycoming and Precision argue that appellants failed to submit any admissible evidence that the accident was caused by a defect in the float and a failure in the aircraft\u2019s carburetor.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">{\u00b6 75} At best, the disputed evidence in this case goes to the issue of whether the alleged misrepresentations or concealment was a cause of the float not being replaced on the accident aircraft. Our review reflects that appellants have failed to present evidence to support their theory that the accident aircraft contained a defective open-cell float and that a failure in the aircraft\u2019s carburetor caused the accident. GARA exceptions depend on establishing a causal connection to the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">{\u00b6 76} We are mindful that at the time the motions were filed, discovery was not completed. However, appellants did not submit any affidavits pursuant to Civ.R. 56(F), setting forth sufficient reasons for the lack of supporting affidavits to justify their opposition. See <em>Brown v. Balnius, </em>Richland App. No. 08 CA 47, 2009-Ohio-2671, 2009 WL 1600992. Further, the lack of evidence on appellants\u2019 theory of causation was raised in response to briefing below and was addressed at the hearing on the motions for summary judgment in the trial court. In this matter, it was incumbent upon appellants to come forward with some evidence to satisfy each of the required elements of GARA\u2019s 2(b)(1) exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-8\">{\u00b6 77} In support of their argument that they have met their burden with respect to the causation element, appellants rely upon the deposition and affidavit of William R. Twa. The deposition was not presented with respect to the summary judgment motions below. Further, Twa indicated at his deposition that he had not reviewed the information regarding the subject accident and he did not know what caused the accident. The affidavit of Twa offers nothing more than a conclusory statement of a causal relationship. We have previously recognized that \u201c[i]t is improper for an expert\u2019s affidavit to set forth conclusory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>statements or legal conclusions without sufficient supporting facts.\u201d <em>Holliday v. Ford Motor Co., </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 86069, 2006-Ohio-284, 2006 WL 178011, \u00b6 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\">{\u00b6 78} Appellants also refer to the expert reports of Dr. McSwain, D. Sommer, A. Fielder, and A. Coffman.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> However, none of these experts offer any opinion that a carburetor failure caused the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">{\u00b6 79} We find that appellants have failed to present evidence showing that a defective float and failure in the carburetor caused the accident. The failure to demonstrate a genuine issue of material fact on the causation element is fatal to appellants\u2019 claim that the GARA exception applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">{\u00b6 80} Accordingly, we find that the trial court properly granted summary judgment in favor of Precision and Lycoming. Appellants\u2019 second and third assignments of error are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">{\u00b6 81} Unison, Lycoming, and Precision each filed a motion for summary judgment on the grounds that appellants\u2019 claims are barred by the 18-year statute of repose under GARA.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-9\">{\u00b6 82} With respect to Unison, insofar as appellants\u2019 claims relate to an original muffler, the action would be barred under GARA 2(a)(1). However, we find that genuine issues of material fact remain in dispute concerning whether a new muffler was placed onto the aircraft in 1987, the resolution of which may trigger GARA\u2019s rolling provision, GARA 2(a)(2). Therefore, Unison is not entitled to summary judgment under GARA.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-10\">{\u00b6 83} We reiterate that the issue of causation as it relates to Unison and the muffler component is not before us at this time. For purposes of GARA, proof of a causal connection is required when a party seeks to invoke an exception to GARA\u2019s 18-year statute of repose. Unison\u2019s motion involves the question of when the statute of repose was triggered. Appellants are not seeking to invoke any GARA exception as to Unison. Therefore, in opposing Unison\u2019s motion only, appellants were not required to present evidence showing that the muffler contained a defect or had a failure that caused the accident. We recognize that appellants still must establish proximate cause to ultimately prevail on their claims against Unison.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-11\">{\u00b6 84} With respect to Lycoming and Precision, appellants\u2019 claims relate to the original engine and carburetor and are barred under GARA 2(a)(1), unless a GARA exception can be applied. In order to invoke the exception under GARA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>2(b)(1), appellants are required to establish a causal connection between the alleged misrepresentation or concealment and the accident. Because appellants failed to present any evidence to support their theory that a defective float and failure in the carburetor caused the accident, Lycoming and Precision are entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">{\u00b6 85} Accordingly, we reverse the trial court\u2019s ruling with respect to Unison, we affirm the trial court\u2019s ruling in favor of Lycoming and Precision, and we remand the matter for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">Judgment affirmed in part and reversed in part, and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b572-7\">McMonagle and Boyle, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b554-12\">.

The manufacturer of the model MA-4SPA carburetor at issue was Marvel-Schebler, a division of Borg Warner Corporation. In 1983, the product line was sold to Facet Enterprises, Inc., which then transferred the assets to a related company, Facet Aerospace Products Co. (\"Facet\u201d). In 1990, Facet sold its aviation carburetor assets to Zenith Fuel Systems, Inc., and Zenith transferred those assets to Precision. Although not undisputed, Precision presumes for the sake of its motion that it has successor liability for the carburetor.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b555-11\">.
