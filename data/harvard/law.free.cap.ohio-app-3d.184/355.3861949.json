The trial court issued the judgment after a nonjury trial and on remand from the original appeal in this case, considered in <em>Walbridge v. Carroll, </em>172 Ohio App.3d 429, 2007-Ohio-3586, 875 N.E.2d 144 <em>(\u201cCarroll </em>I\u201d). The village of Walbridge (\u201cthe village\u201d) is the appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">{\u00b6 2} This case concerns an easement in gross in favor of the village of Walbridge, granting it a right to enter and use land located alongside a shopping center at the corner of Main and Breckman Streets in the village. In <em>Carroll I, </em>we held that the use of the easement is \u201climited to the use by the village as a right-of-way to access the back of the shopping mall.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 27. We also held that the public did not hold a right to use the easement. Id. at \u00b6 31-32. We remanded the case to the trial court \u201cfor resolution of the issue of whether the village has abused its use of the easement right.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 35. Finally, we affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment enjoining the Carrolls from parking in the easement or otherwise obstructing its use by the village for purposes of access to the shopping center. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-9\">{\u00b6 3} A detailed history of the easement and the dispute over its use is provided in our prior decision, <em>Carroll I, </em>at \u00b6 6-14. \u201cSince approximately the 1970s, a shopping center has existed at the corner of Main and Breckman Streets in the village of Walbridge. Adjacent property to the rear and along the side of the shopping center was owned by Kazmaier Enterprises, Inc. [\u201cKazmaier\u201d], and was later purchased by the Carrolls in 1995.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 10. The rear, adjacent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>property included a parking lot and building used for a Kazmaier grocery store. The Carrolls now use the rear property for a health-club facility and parking lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">{\u00b6 4} The easement was created in 1984, by deed, and prior to the Carrolls\u2019 purchase. The trial court described the easement property in its judgment: \u201cThe Easement Parcel runs perpendicular from N. Main Street toward the old Kazmaier\u2019s grocery store. The Easement Parcel is nearly rectangular in shape\u2014 approximately 35 feet wide and 180 feet long. The Easement Parcel extends from North Main Street to the main parking lot for Kazmaier\u2019s grocery store. It does not touch any other property of the Village of Walbridge (other than the Main Street right of way).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">{\u00b6 5} In its October 28, 2008 judgment, the trial court concluded that \u201cthe Easement Parcel has not been abused or overburdened to the extent that it should be extinguished.\u201d On appeal, appellants assert four assignments of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">{\u00b6 6} \u201cFirst assignment of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cUpon a showing by the appellants that the appellee was utilizing the easement in question or permitting the utilization of the easement in question for a purpose not intended by the creators of the easement it was error for the Trial Court to refuse to terminate the easement.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-9\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cSecond assignment of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b391-10\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cIt was inappropriate for the Trial Court to consider anything other than alternatives to termination in considering whether to terminate easement rights after the appellants demonstrated that the Appellee was permitting the easement to be used for a purpose other than that which was intended by the creators.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-11\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cThird assignment of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b391-12\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cIn balancing equities it was inappropriate for the trial court not to take into consideration the actions of the Appellee in creating or permitting an environment which resulted in expansion of the easement.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-13\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cFourth assignment of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b391-14\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cIt was error for the Trial Court to define overburdening of an easement to mean excessive use and, based upon such definition, refuse to terminate an easement where the Appellants demonstrate that the use of the easement had been expanded to include a purpose not envisioned by the creators of the easement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b391-15\">{\u00b6 14} In an appeal of a civil action, a reviewing court defers to the findings of fact of the trial court when there is competent and credible evidence to support them. <em>State v. Wilson, </em>113 Ohio St.3d 382, 2007-Ohio-2202, 865 N.E.2d 1264, \u00b6 24; <em>Seasons Coal Co., Inc. v. Cleveland </em>(1984), 10 Ohio St.3d 77, 80, 10 OBR 408, 461 N.E.2d 1273; <em>C.E. Morris Co. v. Foley Constr. Co. </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>279, 280-281, 8 O.O.3d 261, 376 N.E.2d 578. An appellate court reviews questions of law de novo, without deference to the trial court. <em>Tejeda v. Toledo Heart Surgeons, Inc., </em>6th Dist. No. L-07-1242, 2009-Ohio-3495, 2009 WL 2096306, \u00b6 51.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">{\u00b6 15} The focus of appellants\u2019 arguments in the trial court and on appeal concern use of the easement parcel by third parties \u2014 nonpatrons of their health club who use the easement parcel to enter the health-club parking lot from Main Street and to park their vehicles in the health-club parking lot and by truck drivers with business at the shopping center, who turn around in the parking lot. In its judgment, the trial court made specific findings of fact concerning the use and abuse of the easement property:</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">{\u00b6 16} \u201cThe court finds that vehicles of employees of and customers of the business using the Main Street Buildings used the Easement Parcel to access the defendants\u2019 parking lot and to trespass on that parking lot. The court also finds that the village was less than diligent in assisting the defendants in removing the trespassing vehicles and in prohibiting future trespassing. Finally, the court finds that the Easement Parcel was never obstructed in a manner that would prohibit the defendants [appellants] and their patrons from accessing the defendants\u2019 health club facility.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">{\u00b6 17} We agree with appellants that Ohio cases recognize that termination of an easement may be an appropriate remedy when the owner of the easement abuses or misuses easement rights. <em>Cleveland v. Clifford, </em>9th Dist. No. 02CA008071, 2003-Ohio-1290, 2003 WL 1339142, \u00b6 11; <em>Hiener v. Kelley </em>(July 23, 1999), 4th Dist. No. 98CA7, 1999 WL 595363; <em>Solt v. Walker </em>(May 13, 1996), 5th Dist. No. 95-CA-64, 1996 WL 363438. These cases do not stand, however, for the proposition asserted by appellants in their first assignment of error that termination of an easement is required as a matter of course upon a showing of any abuse of easement rights. Appellants\u2019 first assignment of error is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">{\u00b6 18} In the second assignment of error, appellants argue that once the evidence established that the village \u201cwas permitting the easement to be used for purposes other than that which was intended by the creators,\u201d the trial court erred in considering \u201canything other than alternatives to termination\u201d in deciding whether to terminate the easement, citing <em>Bethel v. Haney, </em>5th Dist. No. 2006 AP 110065, 2007-Ohio-6452, 2007 WL 4227407.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">{\u00b6 19} In this case, the trial court reasoned:</p>\n<p id=\"b392-9\">{\u00b6 20} \u201cThe defendants are primarily objecting to non-patrons of their health club using their parking lot while patronizing the business located in the Main Street Buildings. Automobiles do not have to use the Easement Parcel to reach this parking area. The fact that the village may have been less than diligent in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>prosecuting those who are trespassing on the defendants\u2019 property should not result in the extinguishment of an easement that is necessary for the health and safety of those working * * * [or] * * * patronizing the Main Street Buildings. The court finds that the Easement Parcel has not been abused or overburdened to the extent that it should be extinguished.\u201d (Footnote omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">{\u00b6 21} First, we note that the trial court did not find that the village permitted misuse or abuse of the easement by others. Second, the <em>Bethel v. Haney </em>decision did not involve easements and issues concerning consideration of remedies to enforce the respective rights of subservient property owners against holders of easement rights. <em>Bethel v. Haney, </em>2007-Ohio-6452, 2007 WL 4227407, was a dispute between a property owner and a neighbor who held no interest or right to enter or use the property concerned in the litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">{\u00b6 22} In response to contentions under the second assignment of error, the village argues that the evidence at trial established that it had not encouraged, advised, or given permission to others to use the easement. In its judgment, the trial court did not find that the village intentionally abused the easement or permitted others to abuse it. Instead, it found that \u201cthe village was less than diligent in assisting the defendants in removing the trespassing vehicles and in prohibiting future trespassing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">{\u00b6 23} Second, the <em>Bethel v. Haney </em>case is distinguished by the fact that it did not involve an easement or a demand to terminate easement rights. The case concerned the availability of injunctive relief to a landowner to compel removal <em>of </em>an encroachment on real property by a neighboring landowner without right. Id., 2007-Ohio-6452, 2007 WL 4227407, \u00b6 28-34.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">{\u00b6 24} - We believe that the principles concerning consideration of remedies available to enforce easements under the Restatement of the Law 3d, Property (2000) 492-493, Servitudes, Section 8.3 are instructive as a guide to factors that may be considered in determining whether misuse or abuse of an easement may act to terminate easement rights. Section 8.3 highlights \u201cparticular characteristics of servitudes that may be relevant in the selection of appropriate remedies. It is also intended to illustrate how factors such as the conduct of the parties, continuing utility of the servitude, and the costs and benefits of enforcement may affect the availability and choice of appropriate remedies.\u201d Id. at 493, comment a. Section 8.3(1) of the Restatement provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b393-9\">{\u00b6 25} \u201c\u00a7 8.3 Availability and Selection of Remedies for Enforcement of a Servitude.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-10\">{\u00b6 26} \u201c(1) A servitude may be enforced by any appropriate remedy or combination of remedies, which may include declaratory judgment, compensatory damages, punitive damages, nominal damages, injunctions, restitution, and impo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>sition of liens. Factors that may be considered in determining the availability and appropriate choice of remedy include the nature and purpose of the servitude, the conduct of the parties, the fairness of the servitude and the transaction that created it, and the costs and benefits of enforcement to the parties, to third parties and to the public.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">{\u00b6 27} Supported by the Restatement analysis, we conclude that consideration by the trial court in this case of the costs and benefits of termination of the easement to the parties, to third parties, and to the public were properly considered by the trial court as included within those factors to be considered in determining whether the easement should be extinguished. Accordingly, we find that the second assignment of error is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">{\u00b6 28} Under the third assignment of error, appellants claim that the trial court failed to consider actions by the village that allegedly created or permitted an environment leading to expansion of the easement. We view this assignment of error as challenging both the trial court\u2019s determination as to the village\u2019s responsibility for misuse of the easement by others and of the court\u2019s conclusion the Kazmaier easement was \u201cnot abused or overburdened to the extent that it should be extinguished.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">{\u00b6 29} The trial court characterized the village\u2019s conduct as demonstrating a lack of diligence in removing trespassing vehicles and prohibiting future trespassing rather than as intentional misuse or abuse of the easement. The degree of responsibility of the village for the misuse of the easement by employees and patrons of the shopping center as well as by trucks serving businesses located there was a dispute of fact at trial. After a review of the record, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s findings of fact fairly characterize the conduct of the village with respect to the easement as they are supported by competent, credible evidence in the record. We defer to those findings on appeal. <em>State v. Wilson, </em>113 Ohio St.3d 382, 2007-Ohio-2202, 865 N.E.2d 1264, at \u00b6 24; <em>Seasons Coal Co., Inc. v. Cleveland, </em>10 Ohio St.3d at 80, 10 OBR 408, 461 N.E.2d 1273; <em>C.E. Morris Co. v. Foley Constr. Co., </em>54 Ohio St.2d at 280-281, 8 O.O.3d 261, 376 N.E.2d 578.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">(\u00b6 30} In our view, there is also competent and credible evidence in the record supporting the trial court\u2019s decision that the Kazmaier easement was \u201cnot abused or overburdened to the extent that it should be extinguished.\u201d The Ninth District Court of Appeals decision in <em>Cleveland v. Clifford, </em>2003-Ohio-1290, 2003 WL 1339142, considered a similar dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">{\u00b6 31} In <em>Cleveland v. Clifford, </em>the court of appeals considered a case in which the owner of a restaurant failed to employ all efforts to keep customers of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>restaurant from parking in a \u201cdrive easement.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Id. at \u00b6 12. The Ninth District found no evidence in the record upon which to conclude that the restaurant owner had intentionally violated the easement. Id. at \u00b6 30. The court of appeals did not, as a matter of course, rule that the easement was terminated by the abuse and misuse by customers of the restaurant. Rather, it considered the existence of available remedies other than termination of the easement. The court of appeals concluded that there remained much that could be done by the restaurant owner in the future to prevent parking by restaurant patrons in the easement, including posting of the lot with no parking signs with warnings that vehicles could be towed. Id. at \u00b6 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">{\u00b6 32} The court of appeals held that \u201c \u2018[w]hether an easement is extinguished through overburdening or misuse is an issue of fact.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cleveland v. Clifford, </em>2003-Ohio-1290, 2003 WL 1339142, \u00b6 11, quoting <em>Hiener v. Kelley, </em>1999 WL 595363, *11. Given the availability of the remedy of towing of offending vehicles, the court of appeals also affirmed a trial court judgment that held that the record failed to establish that the appellee overburdened or misused the easement \u201cto the point that it should be extinguished.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">{\u00b6 33} In this case, appellant Terry Carroll testified at trial that he had considered towing vehicles of shopping-center patrons who parked in his parking lot and that he had erected proper signage in the lot to permit towing. The record reflects that appellants posted warning signs in the past providing notice that the parking lot was for \u201cFitness Center Parking Only\u201d and that \u201cViolators to be Towed at Owners [sic] Expense.\u201d The signs also identified the towing company by name, address, and phone number. However, appellants have elected not to tow trespassing vehicles. In the trial court, appellants also opposed consideration of a remedy that would require affirmative action by the village to address the problem of trespassing vehicles.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">{\u00b6 34} It is undisputed that statutory procedures exist that permit appellants, as landowners, to establish a private tow-away zone on their property to permit towing of unauthorized vehicles and to do so at the vehicle owner\u2019s expense. R.C. 4513.60(B)(1) and (2). There is no evidence in the record upon which to conclude that towing of such vehicles, under authority of R.C. 4513.60(B)(1) and (2), would not be an effective means to end the use of appellants\u2019 parking lot by employees or patrons of businesses at the shopping center. The remedy is available and unused. There is little that can gain your attention like a tow.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>{\u00b6 35} Appellants have not claimed that use of the easement by employees or patrons of the shopping center or by delivery trucks materially affected their health-club business or that it denied health-club patrons access to the facility or available parking in the parking lot. The trial court considered the fact that \u201cthe easement is necessary for the health and safety\u201d of customers of the businesses and the employees of the businesses located in the shopping center.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">{\u00b6 36} We conclude that the trial court\u2019s judgment that \u201cthe Easement Parcel has not been abused or overburdened to the extent that it should be extinguished\u201d is supported by competent,- credible evidence in the record. Appellants\u2019 third assignment of error is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">{\u00b6 37} In the fourth assignment of error, appellants contend that the trial court erred in defining \u201coverburdening of an easement to mean excessive use and based upon such definition refuse to terminate an easement.\u201d We find that this argument is without merit. The trial court did not limit its consideration of the facts to the issue of whether the easement itself had been used excessively.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">{\u00b6 38} The trial court considered and made specific findings of fact concerning abuse of the easement through its use for purposes not intended. The court found that \u201cvehicles of employees of and customers of the business using the Main Street Buildings used the Easement Parcel to access the defendants\u2019 parking lot and to trespass on that parking lot.\u201d The court also considered the \u201cless than diligent\u201d efforts of the village in assisting in the removal of trespassing vehicles and in prohibiting future trespassing. It considered these facts in determining judgment. Even with these facts, however, there was competent, credible evidence in the record supporting the trial court\u2019s determination that \u201cthe Easement Parcel has not been abused or overburdened to the extent that it should be extinguished.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">{\u00b6 39} We find that the fourth assignment of error is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-9\">{\u00b6 40} On consideration whereof, this court finds that substantial justice was done the parties complaining and that the judgment of the Wood County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed. Pursuant to App.R. 24, appellants are ordered to pay costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-10\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b396-11\">Osowik and Knepper, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b395-8\">. In a prior appeal in the case, the Eighth District had held that a \"drive easement\u201d did not permit parking and remanded the case \"for a determination of the existence of any abuse of the easement and the appropriate remedy.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
