In 2008, Holcomb moved the trial court to \u201ccorrect sentencing,\u201d arguing that it had failed to include mandatory postrelease control as part of his sentence, thereby rendering the sentence void. The trial court held that Holcomb\u2019s motion was, in substance, an untimely and successive petition for postconviction relief and, accordingly, dismissed it. This court reverses.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">{\u00b6 <em>2} </em>Since his guilty plea, Holcomb has filed a number of motions with this court and the trial court. Among other things, he moved this court for leave to file a delayed appeal; he twice moved the trial court for leave to withdraw his plea; he moved the trial court to correct void sentencing orders; he moved the trial court to correct unlawful sentencing instructions; he moved the trial court to correct the sentencing journal entry and vacate the sentence; and he petitioned the trial court for postconviction relief. This court has previously issued three opinions as a result of his appeals from various actions by the trial court. <em>State v. Holcomb, </em>9th Dist. No. 23447, 2007-Ohio-2607, 2007 WL 1545064; <em>State v. Holcomb, </em>9th Dist. No. 21682, 2003-Ohio-7167, 2003 WL 23094773; <em>State v. Holcomb, </em>9th Dist. No. 21637, 2003-Ohio-6322, 2003 WL 22797731. This appeal is from the trial court\u2019s denial of his latest filing, which he captioned \u201cMotion to Correct Sentencing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b613-9\">ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-10\">The trial court exceeded its authority in denying [Holcomb\u2019s] motion to vacate his sentence, because his sentence is void, a violation of the Due Process clauses of both the United States and the Ohio Constitutions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b613-11\">{\u00b6 3} Holcomb argues that the trial court erred when it denied his motion to correct his sentence. This case provides this court with an opportunity to review the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s jurisprudence regarding void and voidable sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-12\">Historical Perspective</p>\n<p id=\"b613-13\">{\u00b6 4} The Ohio Supreme Court has addressed void and voidable sentences for well over 100 years. An early decision, <em>Ex parte Shaw </em>(1857), 7 Ohio St. 81, 82, involved a trial court\u2019s sentence that fell below that required by statute. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>Supreme Court held that the trial court \u201chad jurisdiction over the offense and its punishment. It had authority to pronounce sentence; and while in the legitimate exercise of its power, committed a manifest error and mistake in the award of the number of years of the punishment. The sentence was not void, but erroneous.\u201d Id. Twenty years later, the Supreme Court reached the same result when considering a sentence <em>above </em>the statutory maximum. It held that \u201c[t]he punishment inflicted by the sentence, in excess of that prescribed by the law in force, was erroneous and voidable, but not absolutely void.\u201d <em>Ex parte Van Hagan </em>(1874), 25 Ohio St. 426, 432.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">{\u00b6 5} Just over 100 years ago, the Supreme Court reviewed a sentence that omitted credit required by statute. In <em>Hamilton v. State </em>(1908), 78 Ohio St. 76, 77, 84 N.E. 601, the court reviewed a sentence that committed the defendant to the workhouse until his fines and costs were paid, without allowing a credit for each day of confinement on the fine and costs. The court held that \u201cwhile not wholly void [the sentence] is incomplete and erroneous, and where such sentence has not been executed, it will be reversed.\u201d Id. at paragraph 3 of the syllabus. Over the years that followed, the court continued to hold that sentences imposed in violation of a statute were voidable. See, e.g., <em>Ex parte Winslow </em>(1915), 91 Ohio St. 328, 110 N.E. 539; <em>Ex parte Fenwick </em>(1924), 110 Ohio St. 350, 144 N.E. 269; <em>Stahl v. Currey </em>(1939), 135 Ohio St. 253, 14 O.O. 112, 20 N.E.2d 529. In one of the last cases in this line, <em>Carmelo v. Maxwell </em>(1962), 173 Ohio St. 569, 570, 20 O.O.2d 170, 184 N.E.2d 405, the Supreme Court held that a sentence imposed contrary to the terms of a statute does not void the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">Void or Voidable</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">{\u00b6 6} The first thorough, modern discussion about void and voidable judgments in the criminal context appears in <em>State v. Perry </em>(1967), 10 Ohio St.2d 175, 39 O.O.2d 189, 226 N.E.2d 104, decided two years after the adoption of Ohio\u2019s postconviction-relief statute. The Supreme Court first discussed the term \u201cvoid\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AqZ\">Within the meaning of the statute, a judgment of conviction is void if rendered by a court having either no jurisdiction over the person of the defendant or no jurisdiction of the subject matter, i.e., jurisdiction to try the defendant for the crime for which he was convicted. Conversely, where a judgment of conviction is rendered by a court having jurisdiction over the person of the defendant and jurisdiction of the subject matter, such judgment is not void * * *.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b614-8\">Id. at 178-179, 39 O.O.2d 189, 226 N.E.2d 104. As for \u201cvoidable,\u201d the court described it this way: \u201cThe word \u2018voidable\u2019 has caused some confusion. Thus, an erroneous judgment that is not void could be considered as in effect \u2018voidable,\u2019 so long as it may be set aside on appeal.\u201d Id. at 179, 39 O.O.2d 189, 226 N.E.2d 104. The court provided two examples of voidable convictions and cited two cases; interestingly, neither of those decisions use the word \u201cvoid\u201d or \u201cvoidable\u201d to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>describe the claim. The first example of a voidable conviction was one for which the factual basis for a constitutional claim was not known until after the judgment of conviction. Id. at 179, 39 O.O.2d 189, 226 N.E.2d 104. The second example was in a case in which the defendant was not represented by counsel at the trial or plea hearing that resulted in the judgment of conviction; the judgment would be voidable at any time prior to a final judicial determination that the defendant knowingly and intelligently waived the right to counsel. Id. at 179-180, 39 O.O.2d 189, 226 N.E.2d 104.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">{\u00b6 7} Just two months later, the Supreme Court considered another case, <em>Romito v. Maxwell </em>(1967), 10 Ohio St.2d 266, 267, 39 O.O.2d 414, 227 N.E.2d 223, involving void and voidable judgments, and, rather than refer to <em>Perry, </em>the court cited <em>Tari v. State </em>(1927), 117 Ohio St. 481, 493-494, 159 N.E. 594, which stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AaL\">This decision must turn in its last analysis upon the distinction to be made between a void and a voidable judgment. If it was a void judgment, it is a mere nullity, which could be disregarded entirely, and could have been attacked collaterally, and the accused could have been discharged by any other court of competent jurisdiction in habeas corpus proceedings. If it was voidable, it is not a mere nullity, but only liable to be avoided by a direct attack and the taking of proper steps to have its invalidity declared. Until annulled, it has all the ordinary consequences of a legal judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">Void sentences \u2014 Disregard Statutory Requirements</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">{\u00b6 8} The Supreme Court turned its attention to void sentences in 1984 in an oft-cited case, <em>State v. Beasley </em>(1984), 14 Ohio St.3d 74, 14 OBR 511, 471 N.E.2d 774. In <em>Beasley, </em>the Supreme Court reviewed a sentence it found void, holding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ArB\">Any attempt by a court to disregard statutory requirements when imposing a sentence renders the attempted sentence a nullity or void. The applicable sentencing statute in this case, R.C. 2929.11, mandates a two to fifteen year prison term and an optional fine for felonious assault. The trial court disregarded the statute and imposed only a fine. In doing so the trial court exceeded its authority and this sentence must be considered void.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">Id. at 75, 14 OBR 511, 471 N.E.2d 774. This language has been cited repeatedly for the proposition that a sentence that disregards statutory authority is void, a conclusion that seems to conflict with <em>Ex parte Shaw </em>(1857), 7 Ohio St. 81, and other decisions discussed above that would conclude that the sentence would be voidable, not void.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-9\">{\u00b6 9} <em>Beasley </em>played a significant role 20 years later when the Supreme Court confronted a trial court\u2019s failure to advise a defendant about postrelease control. In <em>State v. Jordan </em>(2004), 104 Ohio St.3d 21, 2004-Ohio-6085, 817 N.E.2d 864, the Ohio Supreme Court considered the trial court\u2019s failure to advise the defendant about postrelease control at the sentencing hearing. The Supreme Court quoted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number><em>Beasley </em>and held that the trial \u201ccourt\u2019s duty to include a notice to the offender about postrelease control at the sentencing hearing is the same as any other statutorily mandated term of a sentence. And based on the reasoning in <em>Beasley, </em>a trial court\u2019s failure to notify an offender at the sentencing hearing about postrelease control is error.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 26. Again, this conclusion conflicts with earlier decisions that seemingly would have concluded that the sentence was voidable, not void.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">{\u00b6 10} The court revisited this issue three years later in <em>State v. Bezak, </em>114 Ohio St.3d 94, 2007-Ohio-3250, 868 N.E.2d 961. The court held: \u201cWhen a defendant is convicted of or pleads guilty to one or more offenses and postrelease control is not properly included in a sentence for a particular offense, the sentence for that offense is void. The offender is entitled to a new sentencing hearing for that particular offense.\u201d Id. at syllabus. The court held that <em>Jordan </em>controlled its decision: \u201cBezak was not informed about the imposition of postrelease control at his sentencing hearing. As a result, the sentence imposed by the trial court is void. \u2018The effect of determining that a judgment is void is well established. It is as though such proceedings had never occurred; the judgment is a mere nullity and the parties are in the same position as if there had been no judgment.\u2019 (Citations omitted.) <em>Romito v. Maxwell </em>(1967), 10 Ohio St.2d 266, 267-268, 39 O.O.2d 414, 227 N.E.2d 223.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 12. The Supreme Court held that when the \u201ctrial court fails to notify an offender that he may be subject to postrelease control at a sentencing hearing, as required by former R.C. 2929.19(B)(3), the sentence is void * * *. When a defendant is convicted of or pleads guilty to one or more offenses and postrelease control is not properly included in a sentence for a particular offense, the sentence for that offense is void. The offender is entitled to a new sentencing hearing for that particular offense.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">Confusion about Void and Voidable</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">{\u00b6 11} We have noted inconsistencies in the Supreme Court\u2019s application of the concepts of void and voidable sentences. The Supreme Court has recognized its own confusion. A decade ago, in <em>State v. Green </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 100, 105, 689 N.E.2d 556, the Supreme Court reversed a sentence and remanded for a new trial because a three-judge panel in a capital case had not followed specific statutory requirements. The court held that \u201cthere has been no valid conviction and Green\u2019s sentence is therefore void.\u201d Id. Six years later, in <em>Kelley v. Wilson, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 201, 2004-Ohio-4883, 814 N.E.2d 1222, \u00b6 14, the court stated that \u201cdespite our language in <em>Green </em>that the specified errors rendered the sentence \u2018void,\u2019 the judgment was voidable and properly challenged on direct appeal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">{\u00b6 12} More recently, the court discussed void and voidable sentences in detail in <em>State v. Payne, </em>114 Ohio St.3d 502, 2007-Ohio-4642, 873 N.E.2d 306. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>The court began with the simple notion that \u201cvoid and voidable sentences are distinguishable.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 27. \u201cA void sentence is one that a court imposes despite lacking subject-matter jurisdiction or the authority to act.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 27. \u201c[A] voidable sentence is one that a court has jurisdiction to impose, but was imposed irregularly or erroneously.\u201d Id. Where a trial court has jurisdiction but erroneously exercises it, the sentence is not void, and the sentence can be set aside only if successfully challenged on direct appeal. Id. at \u00b6 28. In a footnote, the court stated, \u201cIt is axiomatic that imposing a sentence outside the statutory range, contrary to the statute, is outside a court\u2019s jurisdiction, thereby rendering the sentence void ab initio.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 29, fn. 3. Two concurring opinions recognized the importance of clarifying the difference between a void and voidable sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">{\u00b6 13} Notwithstanding this clarification, the following year the Supreme Court again addressed the distinction between void and voidable sentences. In <em>State v. Simpkins, </em>117 Ohio St.3d 420, 2008-Ohio-1197, 884 N.E.2d 568, \u00b6 6, the court held that \u201cin cases in which a defendant is convicted of, or pleads guilty to, an offense for which postrelease control is required but not properly included in the sentence, the sentence is void.\u201d The court clarified by recognizing: \u201cIn general, a void judgment is one that has been imposed by a court that lacks subject-matter jurisdiction over the case or the authority to act. Unlike a void judgment, a voidable judgment is one rendered by a court that has both jurisdiction and authority to act, but the court\u2019s judgment is invalid, irregular, or erroneous.\u201d (Citation omitted.) Id. at \u00b6 12. The court recognized that although it normally holds \u201cthat sentencing errors are not jurisdictional and do not necessarily render a judgment void, * * * there are exceptions to that general rule. The circumstances in this case \u2014 a court\u2019s failure to impose a sentence as required by law\u2014 present one such exception.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id. at \u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">{\u00b6 14} The court reviewed a long list of cases, back to <em>Beasley, </em>and concluded: \u201cBecause a sentence that does not conform to statutory mandates requiring the imposition of postrelease control is a nullity and void, it must be vacated. The effect of vacating the sentence places the parties in the same position they would have been in had there been no sentence.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 22. The court recognized that a \u201ctrial court\u2019s jurisdiction over a criminal case is limited after it renders judgment, but it retains jurisdiction to correct a void sentence and is authorized to do so. Indeed, it has an obligation to do so when its error is apparent.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id. at \u00b6 23</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">Remedy for Void Sentences</p>\n<p id=\"b617-8\">{\u00b6 15} Although the Supreme Court\u2019s mandate appeared clear, the remedy was not. Following the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decisions, many criminal defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>dants filed motions to resentence, a motion not specifically authorized under the Ohio Rules of Criminal Procedure. The Supreme Court has directed courts to reclassify a motion that is not filed pursuant to a specific rule of criminal procedure in order for the court to know the criteria by which the motion should be judged. <em>State v. Bush, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 235, 2002-Ohio-3993, 773 N.E.2d 522, at \u00b6 10. \u201cWhere a criminal defendant, subsequent to his or her direct appeal, files a motion seeking vacation or correction of his or her sentence on the basis that his or her constitutional rights have been violated, such a motion is a petition for postconviction relief as defined in R.C. 2953.21.\u201d <em>State v. Reynolds </em>(1997), 79 Ohio St.3d 158, 679 N.E.2d 1131, syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">{\u00b6 16} In <em>State v. Price, </em>9th Dist. No. 07CA0025, 2008-Ohio-1774, 2008 WL 1700341, this court concluded that <em>Reynolds </em>and <em>Bush </em>required a trial court to reclassify a motion to resentence as a petition for postconviction relief because the motion was filed after direct appeal, claimed a denial of constitutional rights, asked the trial court to vacate his sentence, and sought recognition that the trial court\u2019s judgment was void. Id. at \u00b6 5. Having reclassified the motion as a petition for postconviction relief, the trial court lacked jurisdiction to consider it because it was an untimely or successive petition. Id. at \u00b6 8. This conclusion, seemingly in conflict with <em>Simpkins </em>and <em>Bezak, </em>followed naturally from the procedure the Supreme Court established in <em>Bush </em>and <em>Reynolds.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">{\u00b6 17} The legal landscape changed in April 2009, when the Supreme Court decided <em>State v. Boswell, </em>121 Ohio St.3d 575, 2009-Ohio-1577, 906 N.E.2d 422. <em>Boswell </em>concluded that a \u201cmotion to withdraw a plea of guilty or no contest made by a defendant who has been given a void sentence must be considered as a presentence motion under Crim.R. 32.1.\u201d Id. at syllabus. Boswell pleaded guilty and was sentenced, but the trial court failed to properly notify him about postrelease control. Five years after he was sentenced, he moved to withdraw his plea, and the trial court granted the motion. The state appealed, and the court of appeals reversed. The Supreme Court again reviewed its line of cases involving void sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">{\u00b6 18} After deciding the Crim.R. 32.1 issue, the court noted that it \u201cmust also address the status of the void sentence.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 12. The court recognized that, unlike parties in prior cases, neither party to this appeal challenged the sentence, although the parties agreed it was void. This case reached the court on Boswell\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea, which did not challenge his sentence as void. The Supreme Court held: \u201cDespite the lack of a <em>motion for resentencing, </em>we still must vacate the sentence and remand for a resentencing hearing in the trial court. Because the original sentence is actually considered a nullity, a court cannot ignore the sentence and instead must vacate it and order resentencing.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id. at \u00b6 12. The Supreme Court vacated \u201cBoswell\u2019s void <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>sentence and order[ed] resentencing if his motion to withdraw his guilty plea is ultimately denied.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">{\u00b6 19} In <em>Boswell, </em>for the first time, the Supreme Court provided direction about how to raise or consider a void sentence. A defendant may raise this claim in the trial court by filing a motion for resentencing and, in light of <em>Boswell\u2019s </em>analysis, the motion should not be reclassified as a petition for postconviction relief. If a sentence is void for failure to include postreleasecontrol notification, the trial court \u2014 or the reviewing court \u2014 has an obligation to recognize the void sentence, vacate it, and order resentencing. <em>Boswell, </em>121 Ohio St.3d 575, 2009-Ohio-1577, 906 N.E.2d 422, at \u00b6 13. Presumably, this means that a trial court, confronted with an untimely or successive petition for postconviction relief that challenges a void sentence, must ignore the procedural irregularities of the petition and, instead, vacate the void sentence and resentence the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">This Court\u2019s Remedy</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">{\u00b6 20} Because a clear, consistent approach to handling these cases will best assist parties, attorneys, and the courts in this district, this court adopts the approach suggested by <em>Boswell </em>outlined above: a defendant may request resentencing because of a trial court\u2019s failure to properly include postrelease control in a sentencing entry by filing a motion for resentencing. The trial court should not reclassify the motion or request as a petition for postconviction relief. To the extent that this court\u2019s decisions, under these specific circumstances, require a trial court to reclassify a motion for resentencing as a petition for postconviction relief, see, e.g., <em>State v. Price, </em>9th Dist. No. 07CA0025, 2008-Ohio-1774, 2008 WL 1700341, or as a motion for relief from judgment under Civ.R. 60(B)(5), see, e.g., <em>State v. Whatley, </em>9th Dist. No. 24231, 2008-Ohio-6128, 2008 WL 5047639, those decisions should not be followed. If a sentence is void for failure to include proper postrelease-control notification, the trial court \u2014 or the reviewing court\u2014 has an obligation to recognize the void sentence, vacate it, and order resentencing. Bo<em>swell </em>at \u00b6 12. Further, a trial court, confronted with an untimely or successive petition for postconviction relief that challenges a sentence that is void, must ignore the procedural irregularities of the petition and vacate the void sentence and resentence the defendant. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-8\">Holcomb\u2019s Void Sentence</p>\n<p id=\"b619-9\">{\u00b6 21} The record reflects that Holcomb was not advised that his sentence included a mandatory five-year period of postrelease control. Accordingly, his sentence is void. Pursuant to <em>Boswell, </em>this court vacates Holcomb\u2019s sentence and remands this case to the trial court to resentence him. \u201c \u2018The effect of vacating the sentence places the parties in the same position they would have been in had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>there been no sentence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Boswell, </em>121 Ohio St.3d 575, 2009-Ohio-1577, 906 N.E.2d 422, at \u00b6 8, quoting <em>Simpkins, </em>117 Ohio St.3d 420, 2008-Ohio-1197, 884 N.E.2d 568, at \u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">{\u00b6 22} The trial court incorrectly categorized Holcomb\u2019s motion to correct sentencing as a petition for postconviction relief. The judgment of the Summit County Common Pleas Court is reversed, Holcomb\u2019s sentence is vacated, and this cause is remanded for the trial court to resentence him according to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">Judgment reversed, sentence vacated, and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b620-8\">Dickinson, P.J., and Whitmore, J., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b620-9\">Carr, J., concurs in judgment only.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b620-10\">Dickinson, Presiding Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AiL\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-11\">{\u00b6 23} I reluctantly join in the per curiam opinion. The trial court had personal jurisdiction over Holcomb when it sentenced him and had subject-matter jurisdiction over the proceeding. It made a mistake in imposing sentence. That mistake made his sentence voidable, that is, subject to being reversed on direct appeal. It did not make his sentence void ab initio. <em>State v. Perry </em>(1967), 10 Ohio St.2d 175,178-179, 39 O.O.2d 189, 226 N.E.2d 104.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-12\">{\u00b6 24} In <em>State v. Simpkins, </em>117 Ohio St.3d 420, 2008-Ohio-1197, 884 N.E.2d 568, the trial court had personal jurisdiction over the defendant and subject-matter jurisdiction over the proceeding. Despite that, the Supreme Court held that because its sentencing entry contained a mistake, the sentence was void ab initio. The moving party in <em>Simpkins </em>was the state. Because of that, I thought the ruling could be restricted to cases in which the state was the moving party. I realize that distinction didn\u2019t make a lot of sense, but my belief was that just because the Supreme Court holds that the sun rises in the west on Sundays, we should not extend that ruling to other days of the week. Accordingly, in <em>State v. Price, </em>9th Dist. No. 07CA0025, 2008-Ohio-1774, 2008 WL 1700341, we, in effect, treated a sentence that did not include postrelease control as voidable rather than void.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-13\">{\u00b6 25} More recently, the Ohio Supreme Court decided <em>State v. Boswell, </em>121 Ohio St.3d 575, 2009-Ohio-1577, 906 N.E.2d 422, a case in which it vacated a sentence as void when nobody had even asked it to. Again, the trial court that sentenced Boswell had personal jurisdiction over him and subject-matter jurisdiction over the case. I take this as a holding that the sun rises in the west on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>Mondays and infer from it that the Ohio Supreme Court believes it does so all week.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">{\u00b6 26} Abraham Lincoln said, \u201c[U]pon the subjects of which I have treated, I have spoken as I thought. I may be wrong in regard to any or all of them; but holding it a sound maxim, that it is better to be only sometimes right, than at all times wrong, so soon as I discover my opinions to be erroneous, I shall be ready to renounce them.\u201d Letter from Abraham Lincoln to the People of Sangamo County (Mar. 9, 1832), in Abraham Lincoln, Speeches and Writings 1832-1858 (The Library of America 1989) 4-5. While acknowledging that I was wrong about the broadness of <em>Simpkins, </em>I urge the Ohio Supreme Court to look again at its holding in that case to determine whether we can\u2019t get the earth again spinning in the right direction.</p>\n<author id=\"b621-6\">Carr, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"ACA\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">{\u00b6 27} For the following reasons, I respectfully concur in judgment only.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-8\">{\u00b6 28} Courts around the state, including this court, have struggled with how to apply the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s numerous decisions about postrelease control. The judges of this court have recognized that there are different approaches that could be taken to decide these issues. This court has taken different approaches in similar cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-9\">{\u00b6 29} In <em>In re J.J., </em>111 Ohio St.3d 205, 2006-Ohio-5484, 855 N.E.2d 851, \u00b6 20, the Supreme Court issued a \u201cdirective that appellate courts should resolve conflicts within their respective appellate districts.\u201d In light of the Supreme Court\u2019s mandate, the judges of this court considered various approaches to resolving these cases. The result is that this court will follow the broad approach outlined in the per curiam opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-10\">{\u00b6 30} There was not complete agreement with this outcome. A minority of the judges of this court would apply the Supreme Court\u2019s holdings on the narrow bases on which they were decided, an approach this court has followed in other circumstances. See, e.g., <em>State v. Hultz, </em>9th Dist. No. 06CA0032, 2007-Ohio-2040, 2007 WL 1238611, \u00b6 12 (\u201cThe narrow holding in <em>[State </em>v.] <em>Miller </em>[2007-Ohio-1353, 2007 WL 879666] does not apply in the instant case * * *\u201d); <em>State v. Brintzenhofe </em>(May 12, 1999), 9th Dist. No. 18924, 1999 WL 292195, at *4. Consistent with a narrow approach, the Supreme Court\u2019s postrelease-control decisions could be applied to cases with the same procedural and factual history. The holding in <em>Simpkins, </em>for example, could be applied solely to cases in which the <em>state </em>has sought a new sentencing hearing because the trial court failed to impose postrelease control, as stated in the syllabus. This court has already distinguished <em>Simpkins </em>based on the facts of the case. See, e.g., <em>State v. Spears, </em>9th Dist. No. 07CA0036-M, 2008-Ohio-4045, 2008 WL 3271048, \u00b6 15 (\u201cThe facts in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number><em>Simpkins </em>distinguish it from Mr. Spears\u2019s situation\u201d). <em>Bezak </em>and <em>Jordan </em>could be applied in the same manner. Finally, the Supreme Court could revisit these questions to address the confusion that currently surrounds these cases. See <em>Simpkins </em>(Lanzinger, J., dissenting); <em>State v. Fischer, </em>181 Ohio App.3d 758, 2009-Ohio-1491, 910 N.E.2d 1083, \u00b6 15 (Dickinson, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">{\u00b6 31} Reasonable jurists disagree about how to interpret and apply the Supreme Court\u2019s postrelease-control cases. The Supreme Court has not been unanimous in its decisions on these difficult and complicated questions. See, e.g., <em>State v. Bloomer, </em>122 Ohio St.3d 200, 2009-Ohio-2462, 909 N.E.2d 1254; Boswell; <em>Simpkins. </em>The justices continue to raise these questions, including, for example, the oral argument heard June 3, 2009, in <em>State v. Singleton, </em>Supreme Court Case No. 2008-1255 (oral argument available at http://www.ohiochannel.org/media_ archives/supreme_court/media.cfm?file-id=120614&amp;).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">{\u00b6 32} I would not resolve this case in the same manner as the lead opinion. But a majority of the judges of this court have agreed to follow this approach. I believe consistency of decisions will benefit the parties, attorneys, and trial courts in this district. Accordingly, I concur in this court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
