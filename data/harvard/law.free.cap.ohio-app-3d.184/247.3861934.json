Collier, appeals from a judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas finding him guilty, pursuant to a guilty plea, of two counts of rape and imposing a 15-year term of incarceration and a $20,000 fine. Because (1) the $20,000 is not contrary to law but (2) the trial court\u2019s calculation of 231 days of jail-time credit is plainly erroneous, we affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-8\">I. Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b283-9\">{\u00b6 2} Defendant was arrested on March 12, 2008, and charged with three counts of rape, each a first-degree felony in violation of R.C. 2907.02, one count of felonious assault, a second-degree felony in violation of R.C. 2903.11, and one count of kidnapping, a first-degree felony in violation of R.C. 2905.01, all arising out of an incident on March 6, 2008. On March 26, 2008, defendant entered pleas of not guilty to the charges, filed an affidavit of indigency, and received court-appointed counsel. According to the trial court record, defendant remained in custody on the charges from the time of his arrest until his sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-10\">{\u00b6 3} Following pretrial negotiations, defendant and the prosecution executed a plea agreement on December 1, 2008, in which defendant agreed to enter guilty pleas to two counts of rape in exchange for a nolle prosequi on the remaining three counts and a jointly recommended 15-year prison term. In addition to setting forth the negotiated terms of the plea agreement, the guilty-plea form defendant signed stated that he was also subject to (1) a mandatory five-year period of postrelease control and (2) up to a $20,000 fine on each of the first-degree felony counts to which he agreed to plead guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-11\">{\u00b6 4} Prior to accepting defendant\u2019s guilty plea at a combined plea and sentencing hearing held that same day, the trial court elicited testimony from defendant that he was a college graduate, he had read and reviewed the guilty plea form with his attorney, and he understood the guilty-plea form he signed. The court advised defendant that \u201cregardless of any joint recommendation,\u201d he was subject to maximum penalties that included prison terms of ten years for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>each offense and, \u201cin addition to that, $20,000, for a total of $40,000.\u201d Defendant confirmed that he understood the potential penalties and that \u201cthe sentence will be up to [the trial court].\u201d After finding that defendant was entering his plea knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily, the trial court accepted his guilty plea, found him guilty, and proceeded to sentencing. No presentence investigation of defendant was conducted.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">{\u00b6 5} In sentencing defendant, the trial court imposed the jointly recommended prison term of 15 years and noted that defendant was entitled to \u201croughly\u201d 231 days of jail-time credit. The court also imposed a fine of $20,000 and commented, \u201cThere\u2019s no question that Mr. Collier \u2014 his conduct warrants not only the prison time but also a financial penalty.\u201d Defense counsel received permission from the court to be heard regarding the fine and stated, \u201cI would just like to remind the Court that Mr. Collier is indigent. I was appointed counsel in this case.\u201d The trial court thanked counsel and responded, \u201cI understand. The Court understands that defendant is indigent. However, the Court will impose $20,000 in fines and also costs * * *.\u201d The trial court journalized its plea and sentencing proceedings in a December 10, 2008 judgment entry. The entry states that the court considered defendant\u2019s present and future ability to pay a fine and financial sanctions and, pursuant to R.C. 2929.18, imposed \u201cthe following fine and/or financial sanctions: Defendant shall pay a fine in the amount of $20,000.00 and court costs in an amount to be determined. Defendant is declared indigent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">II. Assignments of Error</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">{\u00b6 6} Defendant timely filed a notice of appeal and assigns the following errors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A7D\">ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NO. 1:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-8\">The trial court denied Mr. Collier due process of law under the Ohio and Federal Constitution[s] when it imposed an excessive fine on Mr. Collier when the record before the trial court showed that Mr. Collier was indigent, counsel had been appointed, and there was no evidence to show that Mr. Collier had the capacity to pay a fine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-9\">ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NO. 2:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-10\">The parties below erred in calculation of jail credit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b284-11\">III. First Assignment of Error \u2014 $20,000 Fine</p>\n<p id=\"b284-12\">{\u00b6 7} In his first assignment of error, defendant claims that the $20,000 fine the trial court imposed denied him due process of law because not only is the fine excessive but no evidence in the record supports a conclusion that he has the present or future ability to pay the fine.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>{\u00b6 8} Defendant argues that although the judgment entry states that the trial court considered defendant\u2019s present and future ability to pay a fine, the record clearly demonstrates that he did not have a present ability when he was sentenced. To support his argument, defendant notes that court-appointed counsel represented him throughout the trial court proceedings, he was held in jail for 264 days pending trial, and the trial court specifically found him indigent at the sentencing hearing and in the judgment entry. Defendant similarly argues that the record contains no evidence to support a finding that he has a future ability to pay the $20,000 fine imposed upon him. To the contrary, the record indicates that he is indigent, will be imprisoned and unable to work for at least 15 years, and upon his release will have a record as a convicted Tier III sex offender. Defendant contends that this court should exercise its jurisdiction under R.C. 2501.02 to modify the sentencing judgment and strike the fine that the trial court imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">{\u00b6 9} In <em>State v. Kalish, </em>120 Ohio St.3d 23, 2008-Ohio-4912, 896 N.E.2d 124, a plurality opinion, the Supreme Court of Ohio established a two-step analysis of sentencing issues. The first step is to \u201cexamine the sentencing court\u2019s compliance with all applicable rules and statutes in imposing the sentence to determine whether the sentence is clearly and convincingly contrary to law.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 4. If the sentence is not clearly and convincingly contrary to law, the second step under <em>Kalish </em>is to review whether the trial court abused its discretion in imposing the sentence. Id.; <em>State v. Easley, </em>10th Dist. No. 08AP-755, 2009-Ohio-2984, 2009 WL 1804087, \u00b6 15. An abuse of discretion is \u201c \u2018more than an error of law or judgment; it implies that the court\u2019s attitude is unreasonable, arbitrary or unconscionable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Blakemore v. Blakemore </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 5 OBR 481, 450 N.E.2d 1140, quoting <em>State v. Adams </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St.2d 151, 157, 16 O.O.3d 169, 404 N.E.2d 144.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">{\u00b6 10} Pursuant to R.C. 2929.18(A), a trial court imposing a sentence upon a felony offender may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination of financial sanctions that the relevant statute authorizes. R.C. 2929.18(A)(3)(a) authorizes a sentencing court to impose a fine of not more than $20,000 for a first-degree felony. While a trial court may conduct a hearing to determine an offender\u2019s ability to pay a fine, a hearing is not required. R.C. 2929.18(E); <em>State v. Loving, </em>180 Ohio App.3d 424, 2009-Ohio-15, 905 N.E.2d 1234, \u00b6 9; <em>State v. Brinkman, </em>168 Ohio App.3d 245, 2006-Ohio-3868, 859 N.E.2d 595, \u00b6 17; <em>State v. Conway, </em>10th Dist. No. 03AP-1120, 2004-Ohio-5067, 2004 WL 2803418, \u00b6 7; <em>State v. Kelly </em>(2001), 145 Ohio App.3d 277, 282, 762 N.E.2d 479.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">{\u00b6 11} Nevertheless, before imposing a financial sanction under R.C. 2929.18, the trial court must consider \u201cthe offender\u2019s present and future ability to pay the amount of the sanction or fine.\u201d R.C. 2929.19(B)(6); <em>Brinkman, </em>\u00b6 12; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number><em>Kelly, </em>supra. Neither statute nor case law prescribes express factors a court must consider or findings a court must make when determining the offender\u2019s present and future ability to pay. <em>Loving, </em>\u00b6 9; <em>State v. Silverman, </em>10th Dist. No. 05AP-837, 2006-Ohio-3826, 2006 WL 2075642, \u00b6 144, affirmed sub nom. <em>In re Criminal Sentencing Cases, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 31, 2007-Ohio-5551, 876 N.E.2d 528; <em>Conway, </em>\u00b6 7; <em>State v. Martin </em>(2000), 140 Ohio App.3d 326, 338, 747 N.E.2d 318. Rather, the record need only reflect that the court considered the offender\u2019s present and future ability to pay before it imposed a financial sanction on the offender. <em>Loving, </em>\u00b6 9; Brinkman, \u00b6 17; <em>State v. Fuller, </em>6th Dist. No. L-02-1387, 2004-Ohio-2675, 2004 WL 1171056, \u00b6 8; <em>State v. Finkes </em>(Mar. 28, 2002), 10th Dist. No. 01AP-310, 2002 WL 464998.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">{\u00b6 12} A review of the record here demonstrates the $20,000 fine imposed on defendant is neither clearly and convincingly contrary to law nor an abuse of the trial court\u2019s discretion. The fine was not greater than R.C. 2929.18(A)(3)(a) allows for a first-degree felony, and the trial court expressly indicated in its judgment entry that it imposed the fine after considering defendant\u2019s present and future ability to pay the fine.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">{\u00b6 13} When presented with the opportunity to present specific information to the trial court demonstrating his inability to pay the $20,000 fine, defendant did not avail himself of that opportunity, instead relying on the indigency that supported his request for appointed counsel. Neither defendant\u2019s indigency for purposes of court-appointed counsel nor the trial court\u2019s expressly finding him indigent at sentencing precluded the trial court from imposing the fine upon defendant. See <em>State v. Gipson </em>(1998), 80 Ohio St.3d 626, 687 N.E.2d 750 (determining that a defendant\u2019s indigency at time of sentencing does not preclude a trial court from imposing a fine upon the defendant); <em>State v. Burnett, </em>10th Dist. No. 08AP-304, 2008-Ohio-5224, 2008 WL 4482670, \u00b6 9 (noting that a sentencing court is not barred from imposing a fine upon an indigent defendant); <em>State v. Banks, </em>6th Dist. No. WD-06-094, 2007-Ohio-5311, 2007 WL 2874357, \u00b6 15 (determining that an offender\u2019s indigency for purposes of appointed counsel is separate and distinct from a determination of indigency for purposes of paying a fine); <em>State v. Northam </em>(Sept. 30, 1999), 10th Dist. No. 98AP-1592, 1999 WL 770993 (finding that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in imposing a $20,000 fine upon a defendant who was indigent at the time of sentencing).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">{\u00b6 14} Moreover, defendant\u2019s future ability to pay the $20,000 fine becomes relevant after he has completed his prison term. Defendant at the time of sentencing was a 28-year-old college graduate, making him approximately 43 years old when he is released from prison. While defendant\u2019s criminal record and incarceration undoubtedly will hamper his ability to obtain employment upon his release from prison, defendant did not argue in the trial court that he would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>be unemployable after his release, and no evidence in the record suggests any health problems or disabling mental or physical condition that would prevent him from working after his release. If defendant is unable to pay the $20,000 fine after he has been released from prison, he can seek relief under R.C. 2929.18(G), which provides courts an avenue to relieve an indigent person of his or her obligation to pay a fine after the person has completed the incarceration period of his or her sentence. See <em>State v. Williams, </em>10th Dist. No. 02AP-35, 2002-Ohio-4503, 2002 WL 2005815, \u00b6 99, citing <em>Northam, </em>supra. At that time, the sentencing court must inquire into the reasons for defendant\u2019s failure to pay, and it may suspend the fine pursuant to R.C. 2929.18(G) if the court finds that he \u201csatisfactorily has completed all other sanctions imposed upon\u201d him. Id. Under these circumstances, we cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion in requiring defendant to pay a fine of $20,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">{\u00b6 15} The facts and applicable law compel us to conclude that (1) the record lacks clear and convincing evidence that the $20,000 fine imposed on defendant is contrary to law and (2) the record does not demonstrate that the trial court\u2019s decision to impose the $20,000 fine was unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable. Accordingly, defendant\u2019s first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">IV. Second Assignment of Error \u2014 Jail-Time Credit</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">{\u00b6 16} In his second assignment of error, defendant maintains that he is entitled to jail-time credit of 264 days, not the 231 days that the trial court calculated and recorded in the judgment entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">{\u00b6 17} Alleged errors regarding jail-time credit may be raised in a defendant\u2019s direct appeal of his criminal case. <em>State v. Young, </em>5th Dist. No. 03-CAA-10051, 2004-Ohio-4002, 2004 WL 1717601, \u00b6 13, citing <em>State ex rel. Jones v. O\u2019Connor </em>(1999), 84 Ohio St.3d 426, 704 N.E.2d 1223. R.C. 2967.191 requires that a felony offender\u2019s prison term be reduced \u201cby the total number of days that the prisoner was confined for any reason arising out of the offense for which the prisoner was convicted and sentenced,\u201d including confinement in lieu of bail while awaiting trial. The number of days defendant spent in jail prior to his guilty plea and sentencing is confinement \u201carising out of the offense for which [he] was convicted and sentenced\u201d within the express parameters of R.C. 2967.191. <em>Young, </em>\u00b6 10. Accordingly, defendant is entitled to jail-time credit for the number of days of that confinement.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-9\">{\u00b6 18} The trial court is responsible for properly calculating the number of days for which jail-time credit should be given. <em>State v. Miller, </em>8th Dist. No. 84540, 2005-Ohio-1300, 2005 WL 678954, \u00b6 10, citing <em>State ex rel. Corder v. Wilson </em>(1991), 68 Ohio App.3d 567, 589 N.E.2d 113; <em>Young, </em>\u00b6 12; R.C. 2949.12 (addressing the calculation of time, conveyance, and incarceration assignments of convict<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>ed felons and providing that a prisoner\u2019s sentencing judgment should reflect \u201cthe total number of days, if any, that the felon was confined for any reason prior to conviction and sentence\u201d). The trial court\u2019s failure to properly calculate a felony offender\u2019s jail-time credit pursuant to R.C. 2967.191 and to include the amount of jail-time credit in the body of the offender\u2019s sentencing judgment is plain error. <em>Miller, </em>\u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">{\u00b6 19} Defendant undisputedly was held in jail on charges arising from the offenses at issue from the March 12, 2008 date of his arrest until the December 1, 2008 date of his plea and sentencing hearing, resulting in a confinement period of 264 days. The trial court mistakenly calculated defendant\u2019s jail-time credit as 231 days and then included that erroneous amount of jail-time credit in the December 10, 2008 judgment entry. Because the statement in the judgment entry that defendant has 231 days of jail-time credit is plainly erroneous, we sustain defendant\u2019s second assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">{\u00b6 20} Having overruled defendant\u2019s first assignment of error and sustained his second assignment of error, we affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment except as to the amount of defendant\u2019s jail-time credit, and we reverse that aspect of the trial court\u2019s judgment. We remand with instructions to the trial court to correct the judgment to reflect that defendant has 264 days of jail-time credit to be applied to his 15-year prison term and to timely forward the corrected judgment to the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">Judgment affirmed in part and reversed in part, and cause remanded with instructions.</p>\n<judges id=\"b288-8\">Klatt and Connor, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
