Loss-prevention officers overheard the two men discuss cashing a check. Ronald Wood then attempted to cash a fraudulent payroll check. When Walmart refused to cash the check, Wood and defendant left the store and were subsequently apprehended by Sugarcreek Township police. Wood admitted to police that defendant had given him the check made out to him and had asked Wood to cash it. Defendant had agreed to give Wood a portion of the money if he cashed the check.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-11\">{\u00b6 3} As a result of these events, defendant was indicted in case No. 2008CR341 on one count of complicity to commit forgery, R.C. 2923.03(A)(2), 2913.31(A)(3), a felony of the fifth degree, and one count of possession of criminal tools, R.C. 2923.24(A), also a fifth-degree felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-12\">{\u00b6 4} Further investigation revealed that between May 1 and May 14, 2008, defendant provided several other subjects, including William Jackson,' Marco Shoecraft, and Aaron Roebuck, with counterfeit payroll checks that were cashed at Walmart locations in Sugarcreek Township and Englewood, Ohio. Defendant would keep half the money obtained and give the other half to the person who cashed the check. Defendant admitted to police that he supplied the counterfeit checks to the others and kept at least one-fourth of the money they obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-13\">{\u00b6 5} Defendant was subsequently indicted in case No. 2008CR353 on one count of engaging in a pattern of corrupt activity, R.C. 2923.32(A)(1), a felony of the second degree; five counts of complicity to commit forgery, R.C. 2923.03(A)(2), 2913.31(A)(3), felonies of the fifth degree; one count of theft, R.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>2913.02(A)(1), a felony of the fifth degree; and one count of forgery, R.C. 2913.31(A)(3), a felony of the fifth degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">{\u00b6 6} Defendant entered pleas of guilty pursuant to a negotiated plea agreement to the charges in case No. 2008CR341 and the engaging in a pattern of corrupt activity charge in case No. 2008CR353. In exchange, the state dismissed the other charges in case No. 2008CR353 and agreed that any prison term imposed in case No. 2008CR341 would run concurrently with any prison term imposed in case No. 2008CR353. Defendant agreed to pay restitution on all counts, including those that were dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">{\u00b6 7} The trial court sentenced defendant to concurrent maximum prison terms on each of the charges: 12 months on each of the charges in case No. 2008CR341 and eight years on the corrupt-activity charge in case No. 2008CR353, for a total sentence of eight years.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-7\">{\u00b6 8} Defendant timely appealed to this court from his convictions and sentences. He challenges only his sentence on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-8\">FIRST ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR</p>\n<p id=\"b778-9\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cThe court abused its discretion in sentencing Mr. Sims to prison when all the relevant information indicated he should receive community control.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b778-10\">{\u00b6 10} Defendant argues that the trial court abused its discretion in sentencing him to an aggregate eight-year prison term.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-11\">{\u00b6 11} In <em>State v. Barker, </em>183 Ohio App.3d 414, 2009-Ohio-3511, 917 N.E.2d 324, at \u00b6 36-38, we wrote:</p>\n<p id=\"b778-12\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cThe trial court has full discretion to impose any sentence within the authorized statutory range, and the court is not required to make any findings or give its reasons for imposing maximum, consecutive, or more than minimum sentences. <em>State v. Foster, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 1, 2006-Ohio-856, 845 N.E.2d 470, at paragraph seven of the syllabus. Nevertheless, in exercising its discretion, the trial court must consider the statutory policies that apply to every felony offense, including those set out in R.C. 2929.11 and 2929.12. <em>State v. Mathis, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 54, 2006-Ohio-855, 846 N.E.2d 1, at \u00b6 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-13\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cWhen reviewing felony sentences, an appellate court must first determine whether the sentencing court complied with all applicable rules and statutes in imposing the sentence, including R.C. 2929.11 and 2929.12, in order to find whether the sentence is contrary to law. <em>State v. Kalish, </em>120 Ohio St.3d 23, 2008-Ohio-4912, 896 N.E.2d 124. If the sentence is not clearly and convincingly contrary to law, the trial court\u2019s decision in imposing the term of imprisonment must be reviewed under an abuse-of-discretion standard. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>{\u00b6 14} \u201c \u2018The term \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d connotes more than an error of law or judgment; it implies that the trial court\u2019s attitude is unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable.\u2019 <em>State v. Adams </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St.2d 151, 157, 16 O.O.3d 169, 404 N.E.2d 144.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">{\u00b6 15} Before imposing its sentence, the trial court stated that it had considered the presentence investigation report and the statements of both parties, R.C. 2929.19(B)(1), the principles and purposes of felony sentencing, R.C. 2929.11, the seriousness and recidivism factors, R.C. 2929.12, the factors in R.C. 2929.13(B)(1), and the presumption in favor of a prison term for felonies of the second degree, R.C. 2929.13(D)(1). The trial court clearly complied with all applicable rules and statutes in imposing its sentence. Furthermore, the 12-month prison terms imposed for the two fifth-degree felony offenses in case No. 2008CR341, and the eight-year prison term imposed for the second-degree felony offense in case No. 2008CR353, while the maximum allowable sentences, are within the authorized range of available punishments for felonies of the second and fifth degree. R.C. 2929.14(A)(2), (5). Defendant\u2019s sentence is not clearly and convincingly contrary to law. <em>Kalish, </em>120 Ohio St.3d 23, 2008-Ohio-4912, 896 N.E.2d 124.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">{\u00b6 16} Defendant argues that the trial court abused its discretion in sentencing him to an eight-year prison term. Defendant points out that he has no criminal history, that none of the recidivism factors apply, R.C. 2929.12(D)and (E), and that one \u201cless serious offense\u201d factor applies: that he did not cause physical harm to any person. R.C. 2929.12(C)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b779-7\">{\u00b6 17} An examination of the plea proceedings reveals that at the time defendant entered his guilty pleas, he was well aware that he faced a maximum sentence of ten years if maximum, consecutive sentences for his three offenses were imposed. As part of the plea agreement, the state recommended that defendant\u2019s sentences in case Nos. 2008CR341 and 2008CR353 be served concurrently, and the trial court adopted that recommendation. Furthermore, as we previously stated, the sentences imposed by the trial court were within the authorized range of available punishments for felonies of the second and fifth degree. R.C. 2929.14(A)(2), (5).</p>\n<p id=\"b779-8\">{\u00b6 18} The overriding purposes of felony sentencing are to protect the public from future crime by the offender and to punish the offender. R.C. 2929.11(A). Defendant complains that the information provided to the trial court that he was engaged in a nationwide check-forgery enterprise, that he was under investigation by the Secret Service for similar conduct in several other states, and that Walmart\u2019s losses nationwide exceeded $444,000 as a result of defendant\u2019s illegal activities, was unreliable hearsay. However, the trial court stated that because these investigations of defendant\u2019s alleged nationwide activities have not resulted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>in convictions, and defendant is presumed innocent until proven guilty, the court would not give significant weight to those investigations in its sentencing decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">{\u00b6 19} The presentence investigation report states that defendant admitted that he engaged in the criminal conduct with which he was charged in order to get back at Walmart for firing him, but he \u201cnever meant it to go this far.\u201d Defendant left Ohio in 2005 and returned April 24, 2008. Within just seven days, by May 1, 2008, defendant engaged in the fraudulent check-cashing activities in this case. Those activities resulted in an economic loss to Walmart in this case of $3,088.59, for which defendant was ordered to pay restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">{\u00b6 20} The presentence investigation report also states that defendant admitted that he had made over $300,000 the year before from his fraudulent check enterprise. Defendant objected at the sentencing proceeding that the assertion was incorrect, and that he had made no such statement. R.C. 2951.03(B)(2) authorizes the court to \u201cpermit the defendant and defendant\u2019s counsel to introduce testimony or other information that relates to any alleged factual inaccuracy contained in the report.\u201d The burden of proof regarding any inaccuracy is therefore on the defendant who alleges that the report is inaccurate. In this case, defendant could have asked to call the probation officer who prepared the report in order to correct the alleged inaccuracy. Neither defendant nor his counsel made any such request or offered any other evidence to dispute the contention in the report. The court elected to accept the information in the report. No abuse of discretion in doing that is demonstrated.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-7\">{\u00b6 21} The trial court found that defendant takes minimal responsibility for his conduct, minimizes his actions, and does not appreciate the seriousness of his conduct. Defendant told the trial court that it was not his intention to take advantage of anyone, but he failed to appreciate the fact that his fraudulent check-cashing activities were clearly taking advantage of Walmart. The court also concluded that defendant was feigning remorse and that he took advantage of his less sophisticated codefendants whom he used to cash the fraudulent checks, including one mentally challenged individual. Those persons were likewise victims of defendant\u2019s criminal conduct. The fact that an offender shows no genuine remorse indicates that the offender is likely to commit future crimes. R.C. 2929.12(D)(2). Protecting the public from future crime by the offender is one of the overriding purposes of felony sentencing. R.C. 2929.11(A). The trial court specifically found that there were no factors presented by defendant that overcame the presumption in favor of a prison term that applies to the second-degree felony offense of engaging in a pattern of corrupt activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-8\">{\u00b6 22} We may not ourselves have imposed maximum prison terms for these offenses, but our role is not to substitute our judgment for that of the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>court in a matter commended to that court\u2019s exercise of its sound discretion. An appropriate sentence is such a matter. The factors in R.C. 2929.11 and 2929.12 are better considered by the court imposing a sentence, which is in a superior position to evaluate a defendant in relation to those statutory factors. We may reverse only on a finding that the court abused its discretion when imposing a sentence that the court found appropriate. The record reflects no abuse of discretion on the part of the trial court in imposing an eight-year prison term on defendant for engaging in a pattern of corrupt activity involving a fraudulent check-cashing scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">{\u00b6 23} Defendant\u2019s assignment of error is overruled. The judgment of the trial court will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b781-7\">French, J., concurs in judgment only.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b781-8\">Froelich, J., dissents.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b781-9\">Judith L. French, J., of the Tenth District Court of Appeals, sitting by assignment.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b781-10\">Froelich, Judge,</judges>\n<p id=\"Afa\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-11\">{\u00b6 24} R.C. 2929.12(A) provides that a court that imposes a sentence for a felony has discretion to determine the most effective way to comply with the purposes and principles of sentencing set forth in R.C. 2929.11. In exercising that discretion, the court shall consider the factors set forth in divisions (B) and (C) of R.C. 2929.12 relating to the seriousness of the conduct and the factors provided in divisions (D) and (E) relating to the likelihood of the offender\u2019s recidivism. In addition, the court may consider any other factors that are relevant to achieving the purposes and principles of sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-12\">{\u00b6 25} The presentence report (\u201cPSI\u201d) was made a part of the record on appellant\u2019s motion. It reflects that he is 30 years old, is originally from Alabama but lives in Dayton, is single (although he has lived with his life partner for a significant number of years) with no children, completed the 12th grade, is HIV positive, is unemployed, and does not drink or use illegal drugs; .his previous court involvement consists of a \u201ctheft\u201d offense in Alabama in 1998, for which he received \u201cunsupervised probation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b781-13\">{\u00b6 26} The PSI writer\u2019s version of the offense relates a May 9, 2008 incident during which two subjects were in a Walmart attempting to cash a check. Officers soon stopped two vehicles, with Sims in one. Another occupant told the police that he had tried to cash a check given to him by Sims, and which the police determined to be counterfeit. Sims was arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>{\u00b6 27} Subsequent investigation determined that \u201cJoe\u201d (presumably Joseph Sims) was making the checks to cash; various paraphernalia associated with the counterfeiting of checks was also discovered. The writer concluded that \u201cfurther investigation revealed the defendant had fabricated checks in Alabama, Georgia, Illinois, Ohio, Indiana, Washington, California, Florida, Texas and New York. The Secret Service was left to investigate further into the scope of his activities nationwide.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">{\u00b6 28} The \u201cPosition of the Prosecuting Attorney/Police\u201d portion of the PSI stated that \u201cthe defendant has stolen between $600,000 and $800,000 nationwide. The defendant is being investigated by the Secret Service for his activities nationwide. His criminal activities in Ohio are just a small part of his entire criminal enterprise. * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">{\u00b6 29} The defendant\u2019s statement was that he was fired from Walmart for being gay and saw the checks \u201cas a way to get back at them.\u201d In the recommendation section, the probation officer says that the \u201cdefendant was only in Ohio for six days, but managed to steal over $17,000 in Ohio alone. The defendant admitted to making over $300,000 himself in the last year or so on the fraudulent check enterprise.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b782-7\">{\u00b6 30} R.C. 2929.12(B) provides that the court shall consider all of the following that apply to the offender, the offense, or the victim, and any other relevant factors as indicating that the offender\u2019s conduct is more serious than conduct normally constituting the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-8\">{\u00b6 31} (1) The physical and mental injuries suffered by the victim of the offense due to the conduct of the offender were exacerbated because of the physical and mental condition or age of the victim;</p>\n<p id=\"b782-9\">{\u00b6 32} (2) The victim of the offense suffered serious physical, psychological, or economic harm as a result of the offense;</p>\n<p id=\"b782-10\">{\u00b6 33} (3) The offender held a public office or position of trust in the community, and the offense related to that office or position;</p>\n<p id=\"b782-11\">{\u00b6 34} (4) The offender\u2019s occupation, elected office, or profession obliged the offender to prevent the offense or bring others committing it to justice;</p>\n<p id=\"b782-12\">{\u00b6 35} (5) The offender\u2019s professional reputation or occupation, elected office, or profession was used to facilitate the offense or is likely to influence the future conduct of others;</p>\n<p id=\"b782-13\">(\u00b6 36} (6) The offender\u2019s relationship with the victim facilitated the offense;</p>\n<p id=\"b782-14\">{\u00b6 37} (7) The offender committed the offense for hire or as part of an organized criminal activity;</p>\n<p id=\"b783-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>{\u00b6 38} (8) In committing the offense, the offender was motivated by prejudice based on race, ethnic background, gender, sexual orientation, or religion;</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">{\u00b6 39} (9) If the offense is a violation of R.C. 2929.25 or a violation of section 2903.11, 2903.12 or 2903.13 of the Revised Code, involving a person who was a family or household member at the time of the violation, the offender committed the offense in the vicinity of one or more children who are not victims of the offense, and the offender or the victim of the offense is a parent, guardian, custodian, or a person in loco parentis of one or more of those children.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">{\u00b6 40} The victim of Sims\u2019s offense was Walmart in the amount of just over $3,000. While this is not a minor or insignificant number and clearly over the felony amount, it cannot be considered \u201cserious economic harm\u201d to Walmart. None of the \u201cmore serious\u201d factors set forth in R.C. 2929.12(B) applies to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-7\">{\u00b6 41} R.C. 2929.12(C) lists certain factors indicating that the offender\u2019s conduct is less serious than conduct normally constituting the offense:</p>\n<p id=\"b783-8\">{\u00b6 42} (1) The victim induced or facilitated the offense;</p>\n<p id=\"b783-9\">{\u00b6 43} (2) In committing the offense, the offender acted under strong provocation;</p>\n<p id=\"b783-10\">{\u00b6 44} (3) In committing the offense, the offender did not cause or expect to cause physical harm to any person or property;</p>\n<p id=\"b783-11\">{\u00b6 45} (4) There was substantial grounds to mitigate the offender\u2019s conduct although the grounds are not enough to constitute a defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-12\">{\u00b6 46} The theft offenses of which the defendant was convicted \u201cdid not cause or expect to cause physical harm to any person or property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b783-13\">{\u00b6 47} The recidivism factors are listed in R.C. 2929.12(D) and indicate the legislature\u2019s determination that the offender is likely to commit future crimes:</p>\n<p id=\"b783-14\">{\u00b6 48} (1) At the time of committing the offense, the offender was under release from confinement before trial or sentencing or under postrelease control or had been unfavorably terminated from postrelease control for a prior offense;</p>\n<p id=\"b783-15\">{\u00b6 49} (2) The offender previously was adjudicated a delinquent child or the offender has a history of criminal convictions;</p>\n<p id=\"b783-16\">{\u00b6 50} (3) The offender has not been rehabilitated to a satisfactory degree after previously being adjudicated a delinquent child or the offender has not responded favorably to sanctions previously imposed through criminal convictions;</p>\n<p id=\"b783-17\">{\u00b6 51} (4) The offender has a demonstrated pattern of drug or alcohol abuse that is related to the offense, and the offender refuses to acknowledge that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>offender has demonstrated that pattern, or the offender refuses treatment for the drug or alcohol abuse;</p>\n<p id=\"b784-4\">{\u00b6 52} (5) The offender shows no genuine remorse for the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">{\u00b6 53} As best as can be told from the record, including a review of the presentence investigation report, Sims has no prior juvenile adjudications, and the only adult conviction (it cannot be determined whether it is a felony or misdemeanor) is a ten-year-old theft for which he received unsupervised probation; the court did remark that it felt he showed no genuine remorse for the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">{\u00b6 54} Lastly, the court shall consider the following other relevant factors indicating that the offender is not likely to commit future crimes:</p>\n<p id=\"b784-7\">{\u00b6 55} (1) Prior to committing the offense, the offender had not been adjudicated a delinquent child;</p>\n<p id=\"b784-8\">{\u00b6 56} (2) Prior to committing the offense, the offender had not been convicted of or pleaded guilty to a criminal offense;</p>\n<p id=\"b784-9\">{\u00b6 57} (3) Prior to committing the offense, the offender had led a law-abiding life for a significant number of years;</p>\n<p id=\"b784-10\">{\u00b6 58} (4) The offense was committed under circumstances unlikely to recur;</p>\n<p id=\"b784-11\">{\u00b6 59} (5) The offender shows genuine remorse for the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-12\">{\u00b6 60} At least two of these factors, the lack of any prior juvenile record and a law-abiding life for ten years, are present in Sims\u2019s situation; conversely, the lack of genuine remorse was noted by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-13\">{\u00b6 61} In summary, none of the \u201cmore serious\u201d factors of R.C. 2929.12(B) is present, one of the \u201cless serious\u201d factors of R.C. 2929.12(C) is present, one of the \u201crecidivism\u201d factors of R.C. 2929.12(D) is present, one of the \u201cmore likely\u201d factors is present, and two of the \u201crecidivism not likely\u201d factors of R.C. 2929.12(E) are present.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-14\">{\u00b6 62} The probation department\u2019s checklist included with the PSI and which similarly tracks R.C. 2929.12 listed only one factor \u2014 \u201chistory of criminal convictions or juvenile delinquency adjudications\u201d- \u2014 -apparently referring to the ten-year-old theft case from Alabama.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-15\">{\u00b6 63} As we stated in <em>Barker, </em>183 Ohio App.3d 414, 2009-Ohio-3511, 917 N.E.2d 324, R.C. 2929.12 grants the court discretion, and a court is no longer required to make findings or even give reasons for imposing maximum, consecutive, or more than the minimum sentences. However, the court in exercising its discretion must consider the statutory policies that apply to every felony offense, including those set out in R.C. 2929.11 and 2929.12. And in determining whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>the court appropriately considered these policies, this District follows the two-prong analysis of <em>State v. Kalish, </em>120 Ohio St.3d 23, 2008-Ohio-4912, 896 N.E.2d 124.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">{\u00b6 64} Therefore, the trial court\u2019s exercise of its sentencing jurisdiction remains subject to appellate review on the abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>State v. Adams </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St.2d 151, 16 O.O.3d 169, 404 N.E.2d 144; <em>State v. McClain, </em>Montgomery App. Nos. 22551 and 22552, 2009-Ohio-64, 2009 WL 50612. In <em>McClain, </em>we modified two consecutive sentences by making them concurrent, noting that \u201c[cjonsecutive sentences were not appropriate under the sentencing factors.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 14. The concurring opinion emphasized that the \u201csentencing court\u2019s exercise of its sentencing discretion remains subject to appellate review on the abuse of discretion standard. * * Id. at \u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">{\u00b6 65} Subsequently, we upheld a less-than-maximum sentence against an abuse-of-discretion challenge for one count of gross sexual imposition involving a victim under age 13, <em>State v. Hall, </em>Montgomery App. No. 22788, 2009-Ohio-4601, 2009 WL 2855877. We found based on the record made by the court that the seriousness of the offense had no comparison with the non-support charges in <em>McClain. </em>Id. at \u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-7\">{\u00b6 66} Indeed, the seriousness and recidivism factors are not to be equally weighed in some sort of mathematical calculation, but the record must reflect that they were considered appropriately. Discretion is given to the court to follow the legislature\u2019s mandates, and marginalizing the factors set out by the legislature constitutes an abuse of the discretion. Otherwise, the legislative factors become a rhetorical Potemkin village in which a recitation of conclusory statutory findings obscures the potential unbridled discretion the factors were intended to, at least, mitigate.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-8\">{\u00b6 67} The defendant pleaded guilty to a felony of the second degree and two felonies of the fifth degree. In the plea colloquy with the defendant, the court informed him that the maximum penalty was ten years. The court specifically addressed paragraph 16 of the \u201cPetition to Enter a Plea of Guilty\u201d that stated, \u201cThere is no agreement as to disposition, except that the State agrees that any time imposed in Case No. 2008 CR 341 will run concurrently to any time imposed on Case No. 2008 CR 353 * * *.\u201d The court informed the defendant, \u201cThe State agrees that any time imposed * * * will run concurrent * * Later: \u201cNow, do you understand that the State of Ohio is bound by that position in this case, and what that means is they are going to continue with her recommendation that this \u2014 any sentence you may receive would be concurrent * * * But if you do get a prison term the State is saying they\u2019re going to recommend a concurrent sentence * * *. Now, it\u2019s important to understand while the court, let\u2019s address that specifically, may very well follow that recommendation, I am not equally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>bound. I may choose to impose a concurrent sentence or I may choose not to * * *.\u201d The defendant acknowledged his understanding.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">{\u00b6 68} Crim.R. 11(F) provides that \u201cwhen * * * a negotiated plea of guilty or no contest to one or more offenses * * * is offered, the underlying agreement upon which the plea is based shall be stated on the record in open court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">{\u00b6 69} The confusion about the actual \u201cnegotiated plea\u201d arises when the defendant\u2019s signing and acknowledging to the court a written representation with the prosecutor that contained a provision that included \u201cIn consideration for defendant\u2019s plea * * * the State agrees\u201d to concurrent sentences is juxtaposed with the court\u2019s statement that this agreement is only a recommendation that the court may or may not follow, which was also acknowledged by the defendant. Because the concurrent sentences were imposed, this discrepancy is relevant only insofar as it tends to support a belief in the defendant\u2019s mind that the maximum sentence he would receive was eight years.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-7\">{\u00b6 70} The only rationale for imposing the maximum sentence for these nonviolent theft offenses totaling approximately $3,000 from Walmart on this offender with one prior undescribed theft ten years before was if the court had found that this was only the tip of the iceberg, and the defendant had actually been responsible for approximately $800,000 or that he was \u201cbeing investigated\u201d by various law enforcement agencies \u2014 however, the court explicitly stated: \u201cI will note for the record that issues have been taken by the defendant with the report regarding other jurisdictions. I accept the information in the report.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-8\">{\u00b6 71} \u201cI also accept the statements made by counsel. These are investigations that have not resulted in convictions. I think I should stand by the principle that a person is innocent until proven guilty, and I will not put significant weight as to that particular factor as raised by counsel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b786-9\">(\u00b6 72} The court also noted, \u201cI accept the fact that the presentence report indicates that the defendant admitted to making over $300,000 for himself over the last year or so doing the fraudulent check enterprise, that he feigns remorse and the defendant prays (sic) on individuals who cash the checks for him, including, in this particular case, a mentally challenged individual.\u201d The defendant denied making any such statement; I disagree with the majority that the burden was on the defendant to disprove this reported inaccuracy in the PSI. R.C. 2951.03(B)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b786-10\">{\u00b6 73} A trial court may consider uncharged allegations. See, e.g., <em>State v. Hutton </em>(1990), 53 Ohio St.3d 36, 559 N.E.2d 432; <em>State v. Mayor, </em>Mahoning App. No. 07 MA 177, 2008-Ohio-7011, 2008 WL 5451377; <em>State v. Tolliver, </em>Wayne App. No. 03 CA 0017, 2003-Ohio-5050, 2003 WL 22189395. However, these uncharged incidents cannot abrogate the sentencing considerations mandated by the legisla<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>ture. Otherwise, for example, a first-time bad-check, or first-time residue-possession case could result in maximum imprisonment, ostensibly based on disputed and uncharged, let alone unproven, allegations that the defendant is a major drug dealer or wrote the check to support a terrorist organization. This was not the legislature\u2019s intent or direction.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">{\u00b6 74} Within the definition of an \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d is an \u201carbitrary or unconscionable attitude\u201d; this is not a mean-spiritedness or vindictiveness, but rather one \u201cwithout adequate determining principle,\u201d or one \u201cnot governed by any fixed rules or standards.\u201d <em>Dayton ex rel. Scandrick v. McGee </em>(1981), 67 Ohio St.2d 356, 359, 21 O.O.3d 225, 423 N.E.2d 1095.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">{\u00b6 75} The mandatory sentences dictated by judicial findings have constitutionally yielded to the role of the jury. <em>Blakely v. Washington </em>(2004), 542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403; <em>United States v. Booker </em>(2005), 543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621; <em>State v. Foster, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 1, 2006-Ohio-856, 845 N.E.2d 470; <em>State v. Barker, </em>Greene App. No. 09CA1, 2009-Ohio-5036, 2009 WL 3068243. (In the federal context, see, for example, the court\u2019s Sentencing Memorandum, which refers to the \u201cnow thoroughly discredited oxymoron-mandatory guidelines\u201d in <em>United States v. West </em>(D.Mass.2008), 552 F.Supp.2d 74, 75.)</p>\n<p id=\"b787-9\">{\u00b6 76} Rather, we now have \u201cguidelines-Iite\u201d or advisory criteria, or sentencing considerations and factors. But in such a state of affairs, \u201c[a]ppellate review is more important <em>because </em>the Guidelines are no longer mandatory. * * * Now, with the advisory Guidelines and more sentencing variables, appellate review is all the more important in assuring uniformity and reducing sentencing disparities across the board.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) <em>United States v. Foreman </em>(C.A.6, 2006), 436 F.3d 638, 644, abrogated on other grounds, <em>United States v. Young </em>(C.A.6, 2009), 580 F.3d 373.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-10\">{\u00b6 77} The trial court\u2019s minimalization of the statutory factors at the sake of unsubstantiated and disputed allegations resulted in a sentence without adequate determining principles and not governed by any fixed rules or standards. I would reverse and remand for resentencing.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
