As to his reinstatement, that is impossible, since he never held the place and hence could not have been discharged. He held a position of a temporary character under the act of March 27th, 1893. <em>Pamph. L., p. </em>467; <em>Gen. Stat., p. </em>1526. By the express terms of this statute this position ceased to exist <em>upon the </em>creation of the very office he now seeks. <em>The </em>earlier act is not repealed; it is executed.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">As to the demand for appointment to the new position created by the later act, the relator\u2019s sole reliance is upon the statute of March 31st, 1897. <em>Pamph. L., p. </em>142. His contention in this respect is that this act entitles him to \u201cpreferment\u201d to the place in question. 'Without discussing the meaning to be given to this word <em>in its </em>context, or the validity of the act itself, it is enough to say that it does not extend to the office or position sought by the relator. By the title of this statute its operation is confined to \u201c the public service of the State of Hew Jersey.\u201d This being so, the body of the act may not further extend its provisions to municipal offices. <em>Hendrickson </em>v. <em>Fries, </em>16 <em>Vroom </em>555.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">The rule to show cause will be dismissed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
