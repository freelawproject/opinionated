The distinction is between cases in which a discretion must be exercised by the governing body, and the performance of merely ministerial duties by its agents. In the former case the duty committed to the local government cannot be delegated; in the latter case it may act through its authorized officials or agents.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b194-9\">On <em>certiorari </em>to review a judgment of a police justice, &amp;c.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b194-10\">Before Justices Depue, Van Syckel and Garrison</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b194-11\">Eor the plaintiff, <em>Sarmiel A.

No legislative function is delegated to the street committee; a ministerial duty only is conferred.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-10\">The ordinance forbids the deposit of material which will obstruct the use of the streets without a permit from the street committee defining the conditions upon which it may be done. It would not be practicable to prescribe in an ordinance restrictions applicable to.every case. That must necessarily be left to the discretion of a ministerial officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-11\">The rule which forbids the delegation of corporate power does not apply to the delegation of ministerial or ad minis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>trative functions to subordinate officials. <em>Tied. Mun. Corp., </em>\u00a7 113.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">The cases cited by counsel of the prosecutor relate to attempts by common council to delegate legislative functions which have been entrusted to it. This distinction between instances in which a discretion must be exercised by the governing body and the performance, of merely ministerial duties by its agents is fully recognized in the following cases: <em>Gillett </em>v. <em>Logan County, </em>67 <em>Ill. </em>256; <em>Hitchcock </em>v. <em>Galveston, </em>96 <em>U. S. 341; Edwards </em>v. <em>Watertown, </em>61 <em>How. Pr. </em>463; <em>Gregory </em>v. <em>Bridgeport, </em>41 <em>Conn. </em>76.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">The reasons alleged for reversal \u2014 that the complaint does not set forth that the prosecutor placed any obstruction in the street and that the evidence did not show any violation of the ordinance \u2014 are not well taken. The complaint alleges that he violated the ordinance by piling building materials on the northeast corner of Fifth avenue and Heck street, on which he did not place a light at night. That is a sufficient averment that the obstruction was placed in the highway, and the proofs made before the police justice support the allegation. The other reasons relied upon by the prosecutor are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">No error being found in the certified proceedings, they are affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
