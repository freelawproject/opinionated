S. </em>425, presented a like question, as to the legality of bonds issued by a board of county commissioners created by an act of the Tennessee legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">In these instances individuals were endeavoring to establish rights upon an unsubstantial basis, and it needed nothing but the decision of the court to sweep away the foundation of their defence and leave it without support.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">The distinction between the cases cited and the principal case is obvious.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-9\">No private citizen can challenge the legal existence of organized municipal government. It can be successfully assailed only by the attorney-general. Until he intervenes to controvert its authority, and until he institutes proceedings by which it is overturned and suppressed, it is <em>de facto, </em>and the public functions with which it is charged, within the scope of its apparent powers, may be lawfully exercised by its officials as <em>defacto </em>officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-10\">Who denies this must maintain the doctrine that every political subdivision of the state is subject to have the legality and regularity of its incorporation and creation contested by everyone upon whom it attempts to impose its authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-11\">There is manifest error in the proposition that, in resisting the levying of a tax or the enforcement of an ordinance, the litigant can controvert the legal organization of the body politic on the ground that it is established under an unconstitutional act of the lawmaker. Until the attorney-general intervenes the continued discharge of its governmental func<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>tions cannot be arrested. It may be that considerations of public policy will influence the attorney-general to refuse to interpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">The case now considered concerns the public and involves the power to maintain uninterrupted government within the various political subdivisions of the state. The territory embraced within the \u201cCity of Dover\u201d has been set apart as one of those subdivisions, and, although the legislative act under which the municipal government has been conducted since the election in the city is unconstitutional, it is a government <em>defacto </em>and its officers are officers <em>defacto </em>until they are actually ousted in execution of the judgment of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">The writ of error, it is not denied, stays the execution of that judgment. If this were not so anarchy would result in cases where provision is not made for the continuance of the governing body which is displaced and superseded by the void legislation. That such provision is made in this ease cannot logically affect the question propounded.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">There can be no stability or assurance of safety in the conduct of government under legislative enactment if this rule * is not recognized.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-8\">Whether a law is valid and constitutional cannot be known until it is submitted to judicial decision, and it would lead to the wildest confusion and uncertainty in public affairs to hold that municipal government, under the provisions of a legislative enactment, is wholly without authority or sanction where such enactment is ultimately pronounced to be infirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-9\">The act of 1895 is no more void since the judgment of this court than it previously was, and if the \u201cCity of Dover\u201d is not now a <em>de facto </em>government, with <em>de facto </em>officers, it has never possessed those characteristics.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-10\">In our judgment, such a government must prevail and be respected until the attorney-general intervenes by <em>quo warranto </em>and, through judicial action, secures the actual ouster and removal of the incumbents in office.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-11\">The writ of <em>mandamus </em>is therefore denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
