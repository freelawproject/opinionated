In his charge he adverted to the paper as in evidence and to his qualifying remark. He told the jury that there was no evidence to support certain items of the account and that those must be deducted, but that for the others if proved there might be recovery with interest. The items thus submitted to the jury are the first six and last of the series. The following is a synopsis of all pertinent testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>extrinsic to the account: Henrietta Thiel, the plaintiff\u2019s mother, testified that in the middle of July, 1896, she gave her daughter $250 to loan to James Edwards (the decedent), whom she heard ask for the loan. She could not say that Edwards got the money. She had frequently at other times seen money pass between her daughter and Edwards. Samuel Baker testified that \u201c over a year ago this summer \u2019\u2019 \u2014 later stated as \u201c a couple of years ago \u201d \u2014 he saw the plaintiff give Edwards money to pay to witness, on one occasion $25 and'on' another $20. Felix Holden testified that he had seen the plaintiff give Edwards money \u201ca good many times\u201d \u2014 as high as $20 or $30 \u2014 the last time being \u201c along in the spring, the latter part of the winter before he died.\u201d This witness also testified that he had heard Edwards <em>\u201c </em>say a great many different times that $500 would not make Mrs. Leviness good for what he owed her,\u201d the last time he said this being \u201c around October, a year ago.\u201d Harrison Thomas testified that on January 20th, 1897, when witness was sitting in the sick-room of Edwards, who had just been telling him that he had \u201cmade his will and got everything all fixed,\u201d the plaintiff came into the room and that then Edwards said \u201c there is Mrs. Leviness, I owe her $500 \u201d and began to cry, and that the plaintiff said \u201cnever mind that, that is all right.\u201d Edwards died January 24th, 1897. It will be seen that the items of the account were not proved <em>aliunde, </em>and as the case was not put, in the charge, as possible to rest only on the general admission of a debt of $500, there is no alternative but that the jury treated the account as evidential, for their verdict was given for $440.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\"><em>We </em>agree with the trial judge that, unsupported, the account was worthless as evidence. Therefore it should not have been submitted to the jury. Indeed, it should not have been received at all. The items were not of a character to be proved even by a regular book account <em>(Inslee </em>v. <em>Prall, </em>3 <em>Zab. </em>457; <em>S. C. affirmed, </em>1 <em>Dutcher </em>665; <em>Oberg </em>v. <em>Breen, </em>21 <em>Vroom </em>145), and the plaintiff was not a competent witness to prove them. <em>Gen. Stat., p. </em>1407, <em>pl. </em>53.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">There must be a reversal and a <em>venire de novo.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
