Hollinshed, on September 11th, 1894, and the tax deed based thereon, dated November 2d, 1896, recorded in Book No. 217 of Deeds for Camden county, page 473, <em>&amp;c.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">The sale was illegal because neither the warrant to sell nor the return thereto was recorded by the township clerk in \u201cthe record of tax sales,\u201d as required by paragraphs 332 and 336 of the Tax act. <em>Gen. Stat., p. </em>3275. <em>Landis </em>v. <em>Vineland, </em>32 <em>Vroom </em>424.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">The defendants contend that this defect is cured by the act of March 25th, 1881. <em>Gen. Stat., p. </em>3406. But we think that \u201c the township book of minutes\u201d therein mentioned is not \u201cthe record of tax sales\u201d referred to in the sections above cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-8\">The sale and deed must therefore be set aside, with costs to the prosecutors against the township only.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
