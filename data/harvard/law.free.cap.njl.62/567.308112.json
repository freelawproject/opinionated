In virtue of section 41 of the Practice act <em>(Gen.

Affidavits setting out as plaintiff\u2019s cause of action the seduction of his daughter, who was under the age of sixteen, are sufficient to warrant an order of arrest without disclosing any special cause for such order. In <em>Benson </em>v. <em>Bennett, </em>1 <em>Dutcher </em>166, 172, the practice in this, respect was established in this court'.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b604-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>3. The common law rule requiring fifteen days between the test and return of the writ grew out of considerations long since obsolete. It was superseded by our statutory provisions regulating the service and return of writs. Even under the common law practice the objection that less than fifteen days intervened between the test of a writ of <em>capias </em>and the day of its return was waived where the defendant appeared and filed special bail.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b604-6\">4. If there be infirmities in the writ of <em>capias </em>or the order for bail, the proper practice is to apply to the court or a judge to allow further time for filing special bail, pursuant to section 72 of the Practice act, which may be granted on terms either that special bail may be filed without waiver of objections to the preliminary proceedings or allowing further time to file special bail.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b604-7\">On motion to set aside an order to hold to bail and quash the writ of <em>capias ad respondendum </em>issued thereon.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b604-8\">Before Justices Depue; Van Syckel and Garrison.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b604-9\">For the plaintiff, <em>W.

The order for bail was made April 10th, and the <em>capias </em>issued that day. It was made returnable on the 20th of April and returned by the sheriff with the defendant in custody. On the return day, or the day after, special bail was filed by the defendant. On the 9th of May exceptions to the special bail were filed in the clerk\u2019s office and notice given to the defendant\u2019s attorney. On May jLOth notice was given of motion to quash.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-13\">The reasons for setting aside these proceedings are\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-14\"><em>First. </em>Because the writ was returnable upon a day in term and not to the next stated term of the court after the test of the <em>capias. </em>Section 41 of the Practice act <em>(Gen. Stat., p. </em>2540), which provides that courts of law shall always be open (except <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>on Sunday) for the return of all writs and process in civil actions, except writs of error, <em>certiorari, mandamus </em>and <em>quo warranto, </em>is an answer to this objection. The language of this section is so comprehensive as not to require construction. It relates-to the return of all writs and process in civil actions except the writs that are named. In <em>Leigh </em>v. <em>Alpaugh, </em>4 <em>Zab. </em>629, this court held that a <em>capias ad respondendum </em>returnable in vacation was void. This decision was made before the act which is now section 41 of the Practice act was passed. The practice in this respect at that time was regulated by the acts of 1852 and 1854, neither of which concerned the return of writs. The act of 1854 was the only act that contained any provision on that subject, and that act simply provided that the Circuit Court and-Courts of Common Pleas should be open at all times for the presenting, allowance and return of writs of error, <em>certiorari </em>and <em>supersedeas </em>thereon. <em>Pamph. L., p. </em>259.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-5\"><em>Second. </em>That the affidavits upon which the order of arrest was founded contain no evidence that would justify the awarding of a <em>capias ad respondendum.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">The cause of action, as set out,in the affidavits, is the seduction of the plaintiff\u2019s daughter, who was under the age of sixteen. In <em>Benson </em>v. <em>Bennett, </em>1 <em>Dutcher </em>166, 172, the practice in this respect was established in this court, which has been followed ever since. The rule laid down in that case is that in an action in tort, to warrant an order for bail, the affidavit must not only disclose a good cause of action, but some special cause for ordering the bail. This rule, it was held, was subject to two exceptions \u2014 where the cause of action was founded upon an outrageous battery or mayhem, and in actions for seduction. The exception of actions for seduction from the general rule was re-affirmed by this court in <em>Wert </em>v. <em>Strouse, </em>9 <em>Vroom </em>185. These decisions have settled the practice in this court and they govern this ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\"><em>Third. </em>That there were not fifteen days between the test of the writ and the day of its return. The common law rule is stated by Mr. Tidd in these words: \u201cThere must in general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>be fifteen days between the test and the return of the original writ, the law requiring that distance of time between the service and the return.\u201d 1 <em>Tidd </em>107. It-will be observed from this quotation that the fifteen days between'the test and return had relation to the length of time the service was required to be made before the return day, and that it was the length of time between the service and the return that determined the time that should intervene between the test and the return of the original writ. In <em>McNeil </em>v. <em>Gloucester City, </em>22 <em>Vroom </em>444, the action was against a municipal corporation, and there was no statute regulating the service of process upon corporations like the defendant; and hence this court adopted the common law practice of requiring fifteen days as the shortest interval permitted between the service and the return of the writ. The decision in that case rests upon peculiar grounds, and the inference is not justified that the court would set aside a writ regularly issued, regularly served and obeyed- by the defendant, because of the non-observance of a common law formality growing out of reasons long since obsolete.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">The ancient English practice was founded upon the <em>Statute of Marlb., </em>c. 12, which was in affirmance of the common law. The fifteen days that appeared in the writ between its test and return were the fifteen days required for service. \u201cAnd,\u201d as Lord Coke says, \u201c the cause whereof the common law set down the certain time of fifteen days was for that a day\u2019s journey is accounted in law twenty miles, * * * and therefore fifteen days was accounted by the common law a reasonable time of summons or attachment, within which time, wheresoever the court of justice sat in England, the party summoned or attached, wheresoever he dwelt, in England before the king\u2019s writ did come, might by the said account of days\u2019 journey appear in court.\u201d 2 <em>Inst. </em>567. The reason of this common law rule of practice having vanished, there is no ground upon which this court should be controlled by the dry husk of an obsolete precedent-. The rule was superseded by the statutes which regulate the service and return of writs. Even by the English practice of proceeding by an original and a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>summons issued upon it, if there be less than fifteen days between the test and the return of the process it may be amended and will be aided by the defendant\u2019s appearing and pleading to the action. <em>Carty </em>v. Ashley, 3 <em>Wils. </em>454; <em>Wilmot </em>v. <em>Tiler, </em>1 <em>Salk. </em>63; 1 <em>Ld. Raym. </em>671; 1 <em>Tidd </em>123, 147.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">The defendant appeared to the writ and filed special bail. The practice appears to be quite settled that an appearance in conformity with the purpose of the writ is a waiver of all defects, at least those that are formal, either in the process or in the service. <em>Ayers </em>v. <em>Swayze, </em>2 <em>South. </em>812 ; <em>Cornell </em>v. <em>Matthews, </em>3 <em>Dutcher </em>522, 524; <em>Clifford </em>v. <em>Overseers of the Poor, </em>8 <em>Vroom </em>152. Section 65 of the Practice act, which declares that the filing of special bail shall be no waiver, relates only to an application for an order to take testimony concerning the' truth of the affidavits upon which the order for bail was made. <em>Gen. Stat., p. </em>2545. If there be infirmities in the writ of <em>capias </em>or the order for bail, the proper practice is to apply to the court or a judge to allow further time for filing special bail, pursuant to section 72 of the Practice act, which may be granted on terms either that special bail may be filed without waiver of objections to the preliminary proceedings or allowing further time to file special bail. <em>Gen. Stat., p. </em>2546.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">The motion is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
