L. </em>1872, <em>p. </em>803), the common council is author<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>ized to make, modify, amend or repeal ordinances to license, regulate and restrain ale and beer shops, and all places where spirituous, vinous or malt liquors are sold.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">Whether the ordinance of the town requiring the application for license to be signed by six freeholders, passed in pursuance of the thirty-fourth section of the said act of 1872 is of any force since the passage of the Werts law <em>(Pamph. L. </em>1889, <em>p. </em>78, \u00a7 3), it is not necessary to decide. The petition for license in this case was signed by the applicants only. Section 2 of the town ordinance, approved November 6th, 1884, expressly provides that no license shall be taken as granted until'the same is delivered to the applicant, and that the common council may withhold or revoke any license authorized or granted. Therefore, until the license was delivered to the applicant, it was within the control of the common council, and it was competent for the common council to instruct the mayor not to deliver it. Such instruction having been given to the mayor, he is without authority to sign and deliver the license, and this court will not interfere in the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">The <em>mandamus </em>is refused, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
