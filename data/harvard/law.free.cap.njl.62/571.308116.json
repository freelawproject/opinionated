Little.</em></attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b608-7\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b608-8\">Vast Syoked, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Az4\">Morristown was incorporated as a \u201ctown\u201d by an act of the legislature passed in 1865. <em>Pamph. L., p. </em>819.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-9\">The proceedings which the prosecutor has caused to be certified into this court for review were taken by the mayor and aldermen of Morristown under an act entitled \u201cAn act authorizing the cities of this state to appropriate moneys for the celebration of the Fourth of July, Washington\u2019s Birthday and Decoration Day,\u201d approved March 10th, 1880. <em>Gen. Stat., p. </em>1942, \u00a7 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-10\">Unless this act applies to incorporated \u201c towns\u201d as well as., to \u201ccities,\u201d the action taken by the defendant municipality in pursuance of it is without authority and must be set aside. It is restricted in its title and by its terms to \u201ccities,\u201d and can be extended to \u201cincorporated towns\u201d only by construction, by imputing to the legislature an intention to give it that enlarged scope and purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-11\">The question involved can be solved by reference to various other acts passed at the legislative session of 1880.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-12\">An act was approved February 19th, 1880 <em>(Pamph. L., p. </em>40), expressly giving to town councils and township committees certain specified powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-13\">An act was approved March 3d, 1880 <em>(Pamph. L., p. </em>106), entitled \u201cAn act to authorize the erection of city halls in cities of this state which are not the owners of buildings used as such halls.\u201d No reference is made in the body of the act to \u201c towns.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b608-14\">An act was approved March 4th, 1880 <em>(Pamph. L., p. </em>112), entitled \u201cAn act authorizing the incorporated cities and towns of the state to pay their firemen and policemen disabled while in the discharge of their public duties a reasonable compensation during the time they are so disabled.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>On the same day last mentioned an act was approved entitled \u201cAn act concerning cities,\u201d in which the word \u201c town \u201d does not occur. <em>Pamph. L. </em>1880, <em>p. </em>113.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">On the same day an act with a like title was passed, in which there is no reference to \u201ctowns.\u201d <em>Pamph. L. </em>1880, <em>p. </em>114.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">On the 10th of March, .1880, an act was passed in relation' to taxes assessed in any town, city or municipality in this state. <em>Pamph. L., p. </em>157.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-8\">On the same day the act in question in this case, entitled as aforesaid, was approved. <em>Pamph. L. </em>1880, <em>p. </em>172.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-9\">Erom these references it is apparent that the legislature of 1880 did not use the words \u201c cities\u201d and \u201ctowns\u201d interchangeably, but that each of those terms was employed' with a distinct and definite meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-10\">When the legislative action was directed to making provision for \u201c cities \u201d the word \u201c cities \u201d alone was used in the title and body of the act. When the legislation was intended to- apply to \u201c towns\u201d the word \u201c towns\u201d alone was used, and when the legislative purpose was to extend the enactment to both towns and cities it was so expressly declared.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-11\">There is nothing in the act upon which the municipal action in this case is based which indicates an intention on the part of the legislature to embrace within its operation municipalities other than \u201c cities,\u201d in the strict sense of that word. Whether, under its title, it could be made applicable to cities may be questionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-12\">The conclusion to be reasonably drawn from the course of legislation is that this act was intended to apply to cities only, and not to incorporated towns. If the act had been for towns the legislature, it is to be presumed, would have so declared, as it did in other cases to which reference has been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-13\">The resolution certified into this court must be set aside, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
