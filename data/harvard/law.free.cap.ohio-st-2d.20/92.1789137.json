The wrong allegedly suffered by appellants is the failure of respondents to allow such claims and to pay them. Those facts occurred in Franklin County, and, therefore, appellants\u2019 cause of action arose in Franklin County.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">Unless there exists some statutory direction to the contrary, a mandamus action under the facts of this case may be brought in Franklin County. The language of Section 742.46, Bevised Code, wherein reference is made to the fact that a party, allegedly aggrieved, <em>may </em>file a mandamus action in the Court of Common Pleas of the county wherein he resides, is permissive and not mandatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals, holding that it was without jurisdiction in the cause and ordering the cause dismissed without prejudice, is prejudicially erroneous and contrary to law. Therefore, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed and the cause is remanded to that court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b150-9\">Matthias, O\u2019Neill, Herbert, Duncan and Corrigan, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<p id=\"b150-10\">Taet, C. J., dissents because Section 742.46, Bevised Code, provides relator with an adequate remedy in the ordinary course of the law by an action in the Common Pleas Court of his residence.</p>\n<judges id=\"b150-11\">Schneider, J., dissents.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
