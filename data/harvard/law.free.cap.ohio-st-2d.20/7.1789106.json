Relator seeks to prevent the respondents from enforcing a decree of divorce on the grounds that the plaintiff in the divorce action was not a <em>bona fide </em>resident of Lorain County, and therefore the court did not have jurisdiction of the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-12\">The petition shows this issue was raised and determined in the trial court and was reviewed by the Court of Appeals. A motion to certify the record was denied by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-13\">Prohibition is a preventive remedy and not a method whereby a party may have a second review of an alleged erroneous decision. <em>State, ex rel.
