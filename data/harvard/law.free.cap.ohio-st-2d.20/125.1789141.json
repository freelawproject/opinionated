Appellee suggests that, although the significance of the 1937 amendment to the statutory definition of \u201cirregular route\u201d cannot be easily explained, the amendment should not be construed as restricting its authority, under Chapter 4921, Revised Code, to issue a certificate of public convenience and necessity to this applicant.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-12\">An examination of the legislative history of Section 4921.02, Revised Code, reveals that the amendment to the definition of \u201cirregular route\u201d must be considered a limi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>tation and restriction, imposed by the General Assembly, on the jurisdiction and power of the appellee. Prior to the amendment of 1937, the definition of \u201cirregular route\u201d applied to an operation involving the transportation of both persons and property. The addition of \u201ctransporting persons and property\u201d to the definition of \u201cirregular route\u201d would have been superfluous. Thus, because the General Assembly acted in 1937 to amend the definition so as to expressly mention property, the rational conclusion is that the General Assembly intended to exclude the transportation of persons by irregular routes. See <em>State, ex rel. Boda, </em>v. <em>Brown </em>(1952), 157 Ohio St. 368, 105 N. E. 2d 83.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">Appellee argues that such a construction and holding would necessarily mean that the General Assembly intended to hand over to \u201cregular route\u201d passenger-carriers the monopoly of irregular route passenger carriage and that it intended to deny valuable transportation service between many rural areas of Ohio. If such is the result, it is a problem that the General Assembly must consider. This court, in construing Section 4921.02, Revised Code, must assume that the words \u201ctransporting property\u201d were inserted therein for a specific purpose. See <em>State, ex rel. Camean, </em>v. <em>Board of Ed. </em>(1960), 170 Ohio St. 415, 165 N. E. 2d 918. In determining legislative intent it is the duty of this court to give effect to the words used, not to delete words used or to insert words not used.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">The appellee, by granting the application of Executive Motor Livery, Inc., to transport both property and persons over irregular routes, disregarded the statutory limitations and restrictions imposed by the General Assembly upon its authority to issue a certificate of public convenience and necessity. Appellee\u2019s order granting that application is, therefore, unlawful and is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">\n<em>Order reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b183-8\">Matthias, acting Chief Justice, Keens, O\u2019Neill, Herbert, Duncan and Corrigan, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b183-9\">Schneider, J., dissents.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b183-10\">Kerns, J., of the Second Appellate District, sitting for Taet, C.
