E. 2d 888, this court reversed in part a decision by the Board of Tax Appeals allocating the local government fund for Scioto County for 1968 and remanded the cause to the board for a reallocation of the fund in accordance with our opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-14\">New Boston complains because the Board of Tax Appeals, in making that reallocation and in determining the \u201camount needed\u201d by Portsmouth \u201cin addition to revenues available from all other sources,\u201d deducted from such re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>venues income tax revenues of $260,000 as \u201crevenues which\u201d Portsmouth \u201creceives from an additional tax * * * voted by its electorate.\u201d See <em>New Boston </em>v. <em>Scioto County Budget Comm., ante </em>151, for a discussion of basis for such a deduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">In its original allocation, the Board of Tax Appeals made no such deduction from revenues available to Portsmouth. Portsmouth did not appeal from that allocation, although others did. It is therefore now estopped by the previous decision of the board, which necessarily determined that no such deduction should be made. To hold otherwise, as this appeal demonstrates, could lead to endless litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">The decision of the Board of Tax Appeals is reversed and the cause is remanded to that board, with instructions to eliminate the foregoing deduction of income tax revenues from revenues available to Portsmouth, in making the reallocation ordered by the mandate which we issued to carry out our opinion reported at 17 Ohio St. 2d 39.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">\n<em>Decision reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b212-8\">Matthias, O\u2019Neill, Schneider, Herbert, Duncan and Corrigan, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
