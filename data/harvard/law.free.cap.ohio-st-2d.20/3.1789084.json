He began serving his terms on July 3,1962, which would cause his maximum sentence to expire on July 3, 1969.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-15\">However, petitioner has twice been paroled and declared a parole violator. He was at large as a parole violator on his first parole for 61 days and on his second parole for 181 days. He thus has lost 242 days which causes his maximum sentence to terminate in January 1970.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-16\">It is petitioner\u2019s position that the parole board had no right to extend his sentence and that it did so by adding his lost time to the normal expiration date of his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-17\">The parole board did not increase petitioner\u2019s sentence. Petitioner was obligated to serve a maximum of seven years under his sentence. His sentence was not running while he was at large as a parole violator. See Section 2967.15, Revised Code; <em>Cox </em>v. <em>Maxwell, </em>1 Ohio St. 2d 111; <em>Cline </em>v. <em>Raskins, </em>175 Ohio St. 480.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>The parole board properly extended the time for petitioner\u2019s release.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">\n<em>Petitioner remanded to custody.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b60-6\">Tart, C.
