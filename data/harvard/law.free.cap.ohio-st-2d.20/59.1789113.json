Goldberg, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b116-11\">Corrigan, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A28\">Two questions of law presented by appellant in this appeal command our attention.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-12\">In respect to the first question of law, appellant contends that the trial court had \u201ca mandatory duty to give instructions to the jury with respect to defendant\u2019s theory of defense * * * and its failure to give such instructions when requested by the defendant * * * constitutes prejudicial error.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b116-13\">Two of the instructions requested read as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>(1) \u201cThere is nothing in the laws of the city of Cincinnati which forbids or prohibits a person from delivering packages for compensation as long as he possesses an ordinary driver\u2019s license. No taxicab license is necessary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">(2) \u201cIf you find that the agreement between Epperson and the police officer was that the compensation of 50c was to be paid solely for carrying packages, and that the money was accepted solely for the service of carrying packages, then you must acquit Epperson and return a verdict of not guilty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">The trial court refused to give either of these requested instructions and did not include the substance of either requested instruction in the general charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Barron, </em>170 Ohio St. 267, this court held:</p>\n<p id=\"b117-8\">\u201cUnder Section 2945.10 (E), Revised Code, it is not mandatory upon a trial court to give any instructions to the jury in a criminal case before argument, but, if requested special instructions, reduced to writing, are correct, pertinent and timely presented, they must be included, at least in substance, in the general charge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b117-9\">See, also, <em>State </em>v. <em>Corkran, 3 Ohio </em>St. 2d 125, 131.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-10\">The instructions requested were correct and pertinent to the defense, reflected by the record, of appellant\u2019s accepting compensation only for carrying packages \u2014 not passengers. The failure of the trial court to include, at least in substance, such instructions in the court\u2019s general charge was prejudicially erroneous to the substantial rights of appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-11\">The second question of law is poised by the failure of the trial court to further inform the jury of the law of the case, upon the jury\u2019s request, under the provisions of Section 2315.06, Revised Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-12\">After the cause was submitted to the jury, that body interrupted its deliberations and asked instructions of the trial court as to \u201cwhether or not any special license was required by a person who delivers and carries packages for compensation and whether or not the law requires a special license in the event the driver charged solely for delivering packages and the owner of the package chooses to ride <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>along.\u201d Those questions were not answered for the jury by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">Section 2315.06, Revised Code, reads:</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">\u201cAfter the jurors retire to deliberate, if they disagree as to the testimony or desire to be further informed on the law of the case, they may request the officer in charge to conduct them to the court, which shall give the information sought upon matters of law, and also, in the presence of or after notice to the parties or their counsel, the court may state its recollection of the testimony upon a disputed point.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">Such failure, under the facts of this case, was also prejudicially erroneous to the substantial rights of appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">In view of our conclusion that prejudicial error in the trial as outlined above requires reversal, it is unnecessary to pass on appellant\u2019s third claim of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-9\">The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed and the cause is remanded to the Municipal Court for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-10\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b118-11\">Taft, C. J., Matthias, Herbert and Duncan, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b118-12\">O\u2019Neill and Schneider, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
