That duty is explicit. It is not conditioned upon receiving the notice from the board that the duty exists. Therefore, the failure of the board to notify relator does not excuse him from his requirement to file his statement of receipts and expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">Eelator urges further that the deprivation of the right to be a candidate for five years for the failure to file the statement is an unreasonable penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">Eelator admits that the General Asembly has the right, in the exercise of the police power, to impose a penalty, but contends that the penalty involved in this case unreasonably interferes with his right to hold public office.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-8\"><em>*1 </em>The right to hold [public] office is not a natural right or a necessary incident of citizenship, but depends upon compliance with the law and is subject to legislative control and regulation. ...\u201d <em>State, ex rel. Braverman, </em>v. <em>Vitullo, </em>150 Ohio St. 289, 291.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-9\">The imposition of a five-year disqualification penalty for failure to file a statement of receipts and expenses does not impinge upon a fundamental right secured by the Constitution, nor is it so grossly unreasonable as to subject it to judicial interference. See <em>In re Coppola, </em>155 Ohio St. 329.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-10\">\n<em>Writ denied.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b71-11\">Taft, C.
