Oil &amp; Gas Company, Inc. (\u201cK.S.T.\u201d) appeals the trial court\u2019s decision granting partial summary judgment in favor of Summit Petroleum, Inc. (\u201cSummit\u201d), on the issue of liability under a natural gas contract. Summit cross-appeals the court\u2019s denial of its claims for punitive damages and prejudgment interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-14\">We must first direct our attention to the question of whether this court presently has jurisdiction to entertain the appeal and cross-appeal. The basis of the appeal is the granting of a summary judgment to the plaintiff on the issue of liability only. That order fixing liability did not dispose of the matter of damages, as Summit\u2019s cross-motion for summary judgment, which the trial court granted, sought judgment only as to the issue of liability. Accordingly, the question of what damages, if any, to which Summit is entitled, remains undetermined.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>Civ.R. 56(C) says, in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">\u201c* * * A summary judgment, interlocutory in character, may be rendered on the issue of liability alone although there is a genuine issue as to the amount of damages.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">In <em>Davis v. Finch </em>(1961), 115 Ohio App. 104, 20 O.O.2d 216, 184 N.E.2d 596, the court held that summary judgment on an issue of liability alone, leaving the question of damages to be later determined, is interlocutory in character and not appealable. Accordingly, the interlocutory nature of such an order precludes immediate appeal. <em>Cammack v. V.N. Holderman &amp; Sons </em>(1973), 37 Ohio App.2d 79, 80-81, 66 O.O.2d 135, 136, 307 N.E.2d 38, 39-40. See, <em>e.g., Hughes v. Miner </em>(1984), 15 Ohio App.3d 141, 15 OBR 233, 473 N.E.2d 53. That the order of the trial court is captioned \u201cfinal appealable order,\u201d and that the court noted therein \u201c[t]he entry shall be considered the journal entry of the court for purposes of appeal or otherwise,\u201d is of no moment. A trial court cannot transform that which is not, by its nature, a final appealable order, into the same by mere appellation.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">Accordingly, the trial court\u2019s order determining K.S.T.\u2019s liability, and denying Summit\u2019s claims for punitive damages and prejudgment interest, is an interlocutory order and cannot be considered a final order subject to appeal to this court. The appeal and cross-appeal are ordered dismissed for lack of a final appealable order.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b500-9\">Baird and Cacioppo, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b499-15\">. K.S.T.\u2019s motion for summary judgment on liability only suggested that the issue of damages, if reached, should be referred to the court\u2019s referee.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
