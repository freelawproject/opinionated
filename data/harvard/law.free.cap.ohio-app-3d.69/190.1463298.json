Fridley, appeals from the trial court\u2019s order setting aside the determination of the Unemployment Compensation Board of Review approving his application for unemployment benefits. In his assignment of error, Fridley argues that: (1) the trial court abused its discretion in reversing the administrative determination that his employer, the Western-Southern Life Insurance Company (\u201cWestern-Southern\u201d), discharged him without just cause, and (2) the trial court used an unlawful standard of review to determine just cause. We find that neither assignment has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-9\">Western-Southern\u2019s business is selling life insurance. Fridley, a nine-year employee at the time of his discharge, was its district sales manager assigned to the Cincinnati-East office. He was employed in that capacity pursuant to an agreement dated July 1, 1985. Between October 1986 and February 1987, Fridley carried on an extramarital sexual affair with Mallien Walker Cobb, whom he hired in September 1986 as a Western-Southern sales representative. Fridley admitted that he had sexual relations with Cobb on four different occasions while he was her supervisor. On June 17, 1987, Cobb told her immediate sales manager that she was quitting because she could not take any more sexual harassment from Fridley. Fridley, who knew why she quit, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>concealed the reasons from his superiors, but on August 3, 1987, upon learning of Fridley\u2019s conduct with Cobb, Western-Southern discharged him.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">The Administrator of the Ohio Bureau of Employment Services approved Fridley\u2019s September 3, 1987 application for unemployment compensation benefits. The Administrator\u2019s decision was affirmed following a request for reconsideration, and Western-Southern appealed to the Board of Review. The board\u2019s referee conducted a hearing and affirmed the Administrator\u2019s decision finding that the evidence did not establish either sexual harassment or the sort of immoral conduct that would have had a detrimental effect on Fridley\u2019s work for Western-Southern. After the board denied Western-Southern\u2019s application to institute further appeal, the latter appealed to the court of common pleas. The trial court agreed that the evidence did not establish sexual harassment, but reversed as unreasonable and unlawful the referee\u2019s decision holding that Fridley\u2019s conduct did not violate his employment contract on grounds of immoral conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">Contending that the trial court abused its discretion by reversing the board\u2019s determination, Fridley asserts that his conduct neither violated his contract nor constituted \u201cjust cause\u201d for his discharge within the meaning of R.C. 4141.29(D)(2)(a). Since both assignments of error overlap, we have combined them for discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">The term \u201cjust cause\u201d is not defined in R.C. Chapter 4141. Instead, what constitutes \u201cjust cause\u201d is a question of fact to be decided upon the merits of a case-by-case analysis. <em>Irvine v. Unemployment Comp. Bd. of Review </em>(1985), 19 Ohio St.3d 15, 19 OBR 12, 482 N.E.2d 587. Traditionally, \u201cjust cause\u201d is \u201c \u2018that which, to an ordinarily intelligent person, is a justifiable reason for doing or not doing a particular act.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 17, 19 OBR at 15, 482 N.E.2d at 589, citing <em>Peyton v. Sun T.V. </em>(1975), 44 Ohio App.2d 10, 12, 73 O.O.2d 8, 9, 335 N.E.2d 751, 752. Since the Ohio Unemployment Compensation Act is remedial legislation, any determination of \u201cjust cause\u201d must be liberally construed in favor of the legislative purpose \u201cto provide financial assistance to an individual who had worked, was able and willing to work, but was temporarily without employment through no fault or agreement of his own.\u201d <em>Salzl v. Gibson Greeting Cards </em>(1980), 61 Ohio St.2d 35, 39, 15 O.O.3d 49, 52, 399 N.E.2d 76, 79.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-9\">Fridley\u2019s contract provided for termination for cause if his acts \u201cwhen occurring on Company premises or while performing Company-related duties * * * [included] * * * immoral conduct * * * [and] harassment of any kind, including sexual harassment.\u201d This same prohibition appeared in the Western-Southern Manager\u2019s Manual. Fridley\u2019s position is that his extramarital sexual activities did not occur on the premises or during company hours, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>were, therefore, not the type of \u201cimmoral conduct\u201d contemplated by the termination clause of his contract. We disagree. Fridley was not merely engaged in a casual sexual affair with a consenting co-worker, as he argues, but rather, because of his supervisory position vis-a-vis Cobb, he was involved in a sexual relationship which made Western-Southern potentially liable under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Section 2000e <em>et seq., </em>Title 42, U.S.Code (\u201cTitle VII\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">Two classes of sexual harassment are actionable under Title VII: (1) <em>quid pro quo </em>harassment where the employee\u2019s submission to or rejection of unwelcome sexual conduct is used as the basis for promotion or other employment decisions, and (2) hostile environment harassment where the relationship results in unreasonable interference with the employee\u2019s work performance or creates an intimidating or hostile work environment. When exercising delegated authority affecting the employment status of subordinates, a supervisor is not automatically deemed the agent of the employer. However, lack of notice of a supervisor\u2019s conduct does not necessarily insulate the employer against liability under Title VII if the employer has either not developed complaint procedures or failed to react under existing procedures upon allegations of sexual harassment. <em>Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson </em>(1986), 477 U.S. 57, 106 S.Ct. 2399, 91 L.Ed.2d 49.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">That there existed potential liability under the circumstances was borne out on September 8, 1987, when Cobb\u2019s attorney notified Western-Southern that \u201cMr. Fridley harassed and intimidated Ms. Walker [Cobb] from September, 1986 through March, 1987,\u201d and offered to settle her alleged claim for $12,500. Because Fridley\u2019s actions had placed Western-Southern at the threshold of defending a hostile-environment, sexual-harassment claim, the trial court correctly concluded that his extramarital sexual relations with Cobb were, as a matter of law, work-related immoral conduct in violation of his contract constituting just cause for his termination as early as August 7,1987, when the affair was first made known to Western-Southern.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">Fridley correctly argues that credibility and weight of the evidence are generally matters for the referee, and that a reviewing court should not reverse the board\u2019s determination unless it was unlawful, unreasonable and against the manifest weight of the evidence. Cf. <em>Simon v. Lake Geauga Printing Co. </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St.2d 41, 45, 23 O.O.3d 57, 59, 430 N.E.2d 468, 471. There is a recognized exception, however, when the essential undisputed facts demonstrate that the referee\u2019s or the board\u2019s conclusions are unreasonable. <em>Opara v. Carnegie Textile Co. </em>(1985), 26 Ohio App.3d 103, 105-106, 26 OBR 312, 314-316, 498 N.E.2d 485, 489.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>The trial court correctly applied this standard when it found that the uncontradicted facts in the record legitimately permitted Western-Southern to treat Fridley\u2019s conduct as a breach of his employment contract for work-related immoral conduct which was tantamount to just cause for his termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">Fridley presents alternative issues within his assignments. He claims first that the term \u201cimmoral conduct\u201d is imprecise and could not reasonably have been expected to place him on notice that, by engaging in consensual sexual relations with Cobb, he was putting his job in jeopardy. We rejected a similar argument in <em>Duncan v. Greenhills-Forest Park City School Dist. Bd. of Edn. </em>(Jan. 31, 1985), Hamilton App. No. 0-840182, unreported, 1985 WL 9287, in which we concluded that, in a case involving termination of a tenured teacher\u2019s contract for \u201cimmorality,\u201d the ordinary meaning of the word \u201cimmorality\u201d as used in R.C. 3319.16 presented no constitutional defect. Similarly, it is beyond cavil that an extramarital sexual affair is \u201cimmoral conduct\u201d within the ordinary meaning of that phrase as used in Fridley\u2019s contract and the Western-Southern Manager\u2019s Manual.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">Fridley next maintains that the only reason for discharge given to him by Western-Southern was \u201csexual harassment.\u201d He argues that his failure to receive timely notice of the \u201cimmoral conduct\u201d charge invalidates it as a ground, or that, in the alternative, Western-Southern is estopped because of its delay in asserting this ground.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Although the employer\u2019s notice of appeal from the Administrator\u2019s \u201cReconsidered Decision\u201d referred only to \u201cacts of mismanagement, including, but not limited to, sexual harassment of a female co-worker,\u201d the employer offered testimony at the hearing that Fridley was told that he was discharged for \u201cmoral conduct [sic ] and sexual harassment.\u201d The record does not demonstrate that either claimant or his counsel objected or claimed surprise to either the referee or the trial court with respect to the introduction of [imjmoral conduct as a ground for his dismissal. In fact, the claimant\u2019s brief in the trial court addressed the employer\u2019s assertion of immoral conduct. Under Ohio Adm.Code 4146-5-03,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the referee was entitled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>to consider for the first time the issue of whether Fridley\u2019s breach of contract for \u201cimmoral conduct\u201d constituted \u201cjust cause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">Finally, Fridley argues that he did not receive equal treatment by Western-Southern because it did not discharge other employees who were engaged in extramarital sexual affairs. This argument, which suggests that the employer\u2019s course of conduct altered his contract, is without merit. Even if we were to accept the truth of his claim, the record fails to demonstrate that any of those employees mentioned by Fridley were part of a supervisor-subordinate relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">The claimant\u2019s assignments of error are overruled, and the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b226-7\">Doan, P.J., Klusmeier and Gorman, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b225-7\">. Fridley\u2019s assertion of equitable estoppel applies to the actions of an agency of the state. Because of Ohio Adm.Code 4146-5-03, application of the rule that estoppel does not lie against the state in the exercise of a governmental function, as stated in <em>Sun Refining &amp; Marketing Co. v. Brennan </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 306, 31 OBR 584, 511 N.E.2d 112, is unnecessary for this decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b225-8\">.
