The board found that appellee Thomas Russell had not been fired for just cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">Appellant, Metal Powder Products, Inc. (\u201cMetal Powder\u201d), appeals, but counsel for appellant failed to designate an assignment of error in spite of the clear mandate under App.R. 16(A)(2) to do so. While this failure might constitute grounds under App.R. 12(A) to disregard appellant\u2019s claim of error, this court feels it is inappropriate to impose the sanction of dismissal against a party when it is counsel, supposedly a licensed attorney with knowledge of the minimal requirements for a brief in this court, who is at fault. See <em>DeHart v. Aetna Life Ins. Co. </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St.2d 189, 23 O.O.3d 210, 431 N.E.2d 644.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-7\">In the appeal to the court of common pleas, appellant did designate five assignments of error. We shall select the first as the assignment of error in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-8\">\u201cThe Board of Review erred in failing to find that Russell, Appellee, was discharged for just cause in connection with work.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b816-9\">The facts in this case are essentially undisputed. Claimant Russell began working for Metal Powder in March 1977. Metal Powder had an established absenteeism policy that provided in relevant part:</p>\n<p id=\"b816-10\">\u201cThe following rules are to serve as a guideline for the Company\u2019s administration of its absenteeism policy. <em>This does not in any sense restrict the Company from applying other rules to the chronic offender.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b816-11\">\u201cRules:</p>\n<p id=\"b816-12\">\u201c1. Any person whose total time of chargeable absence, tardiness, and short time exceeds forty (40) hours during any three (3) month period shall receive a written warning.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-13\">\u201c2. A second occurrence of chargeable absence, tardiness, and short time exceeding forty (40) hours during any three (3) month period shall constitute a three (3) day layoff, unless one (1) year has been completed without discipline since the last Step.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-14\">\u201c3. A third occurrence of chargeable absence, tardiness, and short time exceeding forty (40) hours during any three (3) month period shall result in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>discharge, unless one (1) year has been completed without discipline since the last Step.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b817-4\">Russell\u2019s employment history and absenteeism record with Metal Powder Products is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">October 1978: written warning</p>\n<p id=\"Agl\">November 1980: written warning</p>\n<p id=\"A5D\">June 1981: three-day suspension</p>\n<p id=\"AbN\">September 1982: written warning</p>\n<p id=\"AfO\">November 1982: three-day suspension</p>\n<p id=\"ACb\">May 1985: written warning</p>\n<p id=\"ARm\">November 1987: written warning</p>\n<p id=\"Asu\">May 1988: discharge for chronic absenteeism</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">When Russell was discharged, he applied for unemployment benefits but his claim was denied by the administrator. On appeal, the referee for the board reversed the administrator and held in favor of Russell. Metal Powder appealed to the Hocking County Court of Common Pleas, which affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-7\">The standard of review in this kind of case is set out in paragraph three of the syllabus in <em>Angelkovsky v. Buckeye Potato Chips Co. </em>(1983), 11 Ohio App.3d 159, 11 OBR 242, 463 N.E.2d 1280:</p>\n<p id=\"b817-8\">\u201cAn appellate court, in reviewing a determination of a court of common pleas on manifest weight of the evidence on appeal from the board of review, may reverse only upon a showing that the trial court abused its discretion. In this context, abuse of discretion connotes more than an error of judgment; it implies a decision which is without a reasonable basis, one which is clearly wrong.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b817-9\">Applying that standard, we find the decision of the board is clearly wrong and reverse that decision. The referee found that \u201cthe facts indicate that the claimant was discharged under a procedure not in accordance with employer\u2019s own rules.\u201d He went on to characterize the employer\u2019s conduct as an \u201caberration.\u201d While the employer did set forth a set of guidelines for employees that involved a step process for continuing absenteeism, the rules clearly reserve the right to treat chronic offenders differently.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-10\">The referee further found that the employer failed to define chronic offender, or to advise Russell he would be treated as such. \u201cChronic\u201d means chronic, continuing regularly over a long period. The word has no other meaning and is commonly used to describe long-term medical afflictions like a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>chronic backache, or recurring behavior like a chronic complainer. In this case, Russell\u2019s conduct can only be characterized as chronically absent.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">The employer has just cause to fire an employee for chronic absenteeism. In <em>Irvine v. Unemp. Comp. Bd. of Review </em>(1985), 19 Ohio St.3d 15, 19 OBR 12, 482 N.E.2d 587, the Ohio Supreme Court said:</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">\u201cThe term \u2018just cause\u2019 has not been clearly defined in our case law. We are in agreement with one of our appellate courts that \u2018[tjhere is, of course, not a slide-rule definition of just cause. Essentially, each case must be considered upon its particular merits. Traditionally, just cause, in the statutory sense, is that which, to an ordinarily intelligent person, is a justifiable reason for doing or not doing a particular act.\u2019 <em>Peyton v. Sun T. V. </em>(1975), 44 Ohio App.2d 10, 12 [73 O.O.2d 8, 9, 335 N.E.2d 751, 752].\u201d <em>Irvine, supra, </em>19 Ohio St.3d at 17, 19 OBR at 14, 482 N.E.2d at 589.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">Applying the standards set out in <em>Irvine, supra, </em>and <em>Angelkovsky, supra, </em>we find that the decision of the board and the judgment of the trial court affirming the decision are against the manifest weight of the evidence and an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-7\">Appellant\u2019s assignment of error is well taken. The judgment of the trial court is reversed, and this case is remanded to the Unemployment Compensation Board of Review with the direction to enter a finding in favor of appellant Metal Powder Products consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-8\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b818-9\">Haksha, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b818-10\">Stephenson, J., concurs in judgment only.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
