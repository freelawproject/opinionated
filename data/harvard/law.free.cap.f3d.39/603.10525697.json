PARKER, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b691-4\">Plaintiffs-Appellants and Intervenor-Ap-pellant appeal the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on grounds that Defendant-Appellee was a statutory employer for purposes of Section 23:1061 of the Louisiana Worker\u2019s Compensation Act, and the district court\u2019s denial of their motions for reconsideration pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b). They challenge the court\u2019s finding of statutory employer status, arguing that the work performed was not an integral part of Defendant-Appellee\u2019s business. We find the work of installing a replacement flare stack was an integral part of the business of Defendant-Appellee. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">On July 12, 1991, Ted Kinsey (\u201cKinsey\u201d), an employee of Bayou Sale Contractors, Inc. (\u201cBayou\u201d), was injured at the Pollock, Louisiana location of Farmland Industries, Inc. (\u201cFarmland\u201d) when the scaffold board upon which he was standing while welding collapsed. Kinsey filed a worker\u2019s compensation claim which was accepted by Travelers Insurance Company (\u201cTravelers\u201d), the worker\u2019s compensation insurer of Bayou and paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">On July 8, 1992, the Kinseys filed suit against Farmland seeking damages for personal injury and loss of consortium. Farmland filed a third-party demand against Bayou, its insurer Underwriters at Lloyds of London, and David H. Stiel, Jr., d/b/a David H. Stiel, Jr. Agency. Farmland subsequently moved to dismiss its third-party demand against Underwriters at Lloyds of London, which was granted by the district court on November 23, 1992. Farmland\u2019s third-party demand against David H. Stiel, Jr. was later dismissed on October 27, 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-8\">On July 2, 1993, Travelers intervened for indemnity, medical and incidental expenses paid to or on behalf of Kinsey as a result of the July 12,1991 accident. Farmland filed a motion for summary judgment on July 15, 1993 arguing that it was Kinsey\u2019s \u201cstatutory employer\u201d under section 23:1061 of the Louisiana Worker\u2019s Compensation Act. The district court granted the motion and entered judgment for Farmland, and against the Kin-seys, on November 24, 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-10\">The Kinseys and Travelers appealed the summary judgment order, which was subsequently dismissed by this Court because the indemnity issue raised by Farmland in a August 13, 1993 summary judgment motion had not been resolved by the district court. On April 11, 1994, the Kinseys filed a motion for reconsideration of the November 24,1993 summary judgment order pursuant to Rule 60(b). Travelers filed a Rule 60(b) motion adopting the Kinseys\u2019 motion on April 28, 1994. On May 20, 1994, the district court entered a memorandum order denying Farmland\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the indemnity issue. On June 27, 1994, the court entered an order denying both Rule 60(b) motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-11\">On June 28, 1994, the Kinseys\u2019 appeal was entered for the district court\u2019s ruling on their motion for reconsideration entered on June 27, 1994. Travelers\u2019 appeal from the June 27, 1994 and the November 24, 1993 rulings was entered on July 5, 1994. On July 19, 1994, the Kinseys entered an Amended Notice of Appeal to include the court\u2019s ruling on November 24, 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-12\">FEDERAL RULE OF APPELLATE PROCEDURE 4</p>\n<p id=\"b691-13\">Farmland contends that this Court lacks jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s summary judgment ruling on November 24, 1993 because both the Kinseys and Travelers failed to file timely appeals. Specifically, Farmland argues that final disposition of the case was not entered until the court\u2019s May 20, 1994 ruling on the indemnity issue. The Kinseys\u2019 June 27, 1994 Notice of Appeal addressed only the court\u2019s ruling on their Rule 60(b) motion, and not the summary judgment order. The Kinseys\u2019 Amended Notice of Appeal, which added the court\u2019s ruling on summary judgment from November 24, 1993, was not filed within 30 days of the May 20,1994 final disposition of the case. Farmland also argues that Travelers\u2019 July 5, 1994 Notice of Appeal was filed more than 30 days after the May 20, 1994 disposition of summary judgment, although it was timely filed with regard to the court\u2019s ruling on its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>Rule 60(b) motion. Therefore, both the Kin-seys and Travelers have timely appealed only the court\u2019s ruling on their Rule 60(b) motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\">Rule 4(a)(4) of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-5\">If any party makes a timely motion of a type specified immediately below, the time for appeal for all parties runs from the entry of the order disposing of the last such motion outstanding. This provision applies to a timely motion under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-6\">(F) for relief under Rule 60 if the motion is served within 10 days after the entry of judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">Fed.R.App.P. 4(a)(4) (1994). .The rule has the effect of tolling the 30 day time for appeal until after the district court has ruled on the Rule 60 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-8\">In this case, the district court\u2019s final disposition of the summary judgment motion was entered on May 20, 1994. Therefore, the 30 day time for appeal would begin to run at that date. However, both the Kinseys and Travelers filed Rule 60(b) motions prior to the court\u2019s May 20, 1994 ruling. We have previously held that if the final disposition of the case has not been entered at the time a party files a Rule 60 motion, the motion is timely and effective for purposes of applying Rule 4(a)(4). <em>See Craig v. Lynaugh, </em>846 F.2d 11, 13 (5th Cir.1988). Therefore, the 30 day time for appeal was tolled until the court ruled on the Rule 60(b) motions. The court entered its order denying both motions on June 27, 1994. All subsequent Notices of Appeal were filed within 30 days of the June 27, 1994 order, including the Kinseys\u2019 Amended Notice of Appeal. Therefore, we find that we have jurisdiction over the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-9\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b692-10\">Review of a motion for summary judgment is plenary. <em>Lodge Hall Music, Inc. v. Waco Wrangler Club, Inc., </em>831 F.2d 77, 79 (5th Cir.1987). Although review is <em>de novo, </em>we apply the same standards governing the district court\u2019s determination. <em>Jackson v. Federal Deposit Ins. Corp., </em>981 F.2d 730, 732 (5th Cir.1992). Summary judgment must be granted if the court determines that \u201cthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). To. determine whether there are any genuine issues of material fact, the court must first consult the applicable substantive law to ascertain what factual issues are material. The moving party bears the burden of coming forward with proof of the absence of any genuine issues of material fact through the identification of those portions of the pleadings, depositions, answers' to the interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with any affidavits which it believes demonstrates the absence of any genuine issues of material fact. <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 2553, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986). The nonmovant is then required to counter the motion for summary judgment. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e). \u201c[M]ere general allegations which do not reveal detailed and precise facts will not prevent the award of summary judgment.\u201d <em>Nicholas Acoustics, Specialty Co. v. H &amp; M Const. Co., Inc., </em>695 F.2d 839, 844 (5th Cir.1983) (quoting <em>Liberty Leasing Co. v. Hillsum Sales Corp., </em>380 F.2d 1013, 1051 (5th Cir.1967)). The court must then review all evidence bearing on those issues, viewing the facts and inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. <em>Lavespere v. Niagara Mach. &amp; Tool Works, Inc., </em>910 F.2d 167 (5th Cir.1990), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 114 S.Ct. 171, 126 L.Ed.2d 131 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-13\">STATUTORY EMPLOYER</p>\n<p id=\"b692-14\">Under the Louisiana Worker\u2019s Compensation Act, a \u201cprincipal\u201d who engages a contractor to perform work that is part of the principal\u2019s \u201ctrade, business, or occupation,\u201d is liable to pay any worker\u2019s compensation benefits to an employee of the contractor injured in the performance of the work. LaRev. Stat. \u00a7 23:1061(A). A principal who falls within this statute, referred to as a statutory employer, is immune from any tort liability brought by the injured statutory employee. <em>See </em>LaRev.Stat. \u00a7 23:1032; <em>see </em>also <em>Thomp</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number><em>son v. Georgia Pacific Corp., </em>993 F.2d 1166, 1168 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-4\">A statutory employer relationship exists when the work performed is a part of the principal\u2019s trade, occupation, or business. The original standard applied for determining statutory employer status was the \u201cintegral relation\u201d test established by the Louisiana Supreme Court in <em>Thibodaux v. Sun Oil Co., </em>218 La. 453, 49 So.2d 852, 854 (1950). If the contractor was engaged in work that was an integral part of the trade, business, or occupation of the principal, then the principal was considered a statutory employer. <em>Id. </em>In 1986, however, the Louisiana Supreme Court developed the more restrictive test outline in <em>Berry v. Holston Well Service, Inc., </em>488 So.2d 934 (La.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">In 1989, the Louisiana Legislature amended \u00a7 23:1061, effectively overruling the <em>Berry </em>decision.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Subsequently, this Court held that the 1989 amendment \u201clegislatively revised the <em>Berry </em>test and effective directed the courts back to the previously discarded \u2018integral relation\u2019 test found in <em>Thibodaux.\u201d Harris v. Murphy Oil, U.S.A., Inc., </em>980 F.2d 991, 993 (5th Cir.1992); <em>see </em>also <em>Salsbury v. Hood Industries, Inc., </em>982 F.2d 912, 916 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">In this ease, Farmland decided to replace its flare stack by installing a new one and then dismantling the old one. Farmland is in the business of producing ammonia emissions, and the flare stack is used on a daily basis to reduce the emission of ammonia in the air. Although the old flare stack was fully functional and operational, the new flare stack was capable of burning more ammonia than the old stack.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">For purposes of determining Farmland\u2019s statutory employer status, the work at issue is the replacement of the flare stack. We believe that the replacement of the old flare stack with a new one capable of burning more ammonia was an integral part of Farmland\u2019s business. The fact that the new flare stack failed to decrease ammonia emissions in the year following its installation does not make the work of replacing the flare stack a non-integral part of Farmland\u2019s business. Nor does it create a genuine issue of material fact with regard to why the flare stack was replaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-11\">The Kinseys and Travelers also appealed the district court\u2019s denial of their Rule 60(b) motions for reconsideration. We find that they failed to present any issues that would warrant reconsideration of the court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-12\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b693-13\">We find that Farmland was Kinsey\u2019s statutory employer, and therefore, the district court properly granted Farmland\u2019s motion for summary judgment. We further find that the district court\u2019s ruling denying the Kinseys and Travelers\u2019 motions for reconsideration pursuant to Rule 60(b) was appropriate. AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b693-8\">. The amendment is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AmBR\">The fact that work is specialized or nonspecial-ized, is extraordinary construction or simple maintenance, is work that is usually done by contract or by the principal\u2019s direct employee, or is routine or unpredictable, shall not prevent the work undertaken by the principal from being considered part of the principal\u2019s trade, business, or occupation, regardless of whether the principal has the equipment or manpower capable of performing the work.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A5E_\">La.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 23:1061.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
