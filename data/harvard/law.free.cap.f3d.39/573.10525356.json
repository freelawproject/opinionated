The district court sentenced Hernandez to the mandatory minimum sentence of 60 months. Hernandez appealed to this court, arguing that the district court erred in considering all of the marijuana seized in connection with his arrest when determining his sentence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-23\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b659-24\">Jesus Luna offered Hernandez $300 to carry a package of marijuana from Mexico to the United States. Hernandez accepted, and the two men walked to a place where they met approximately eleven other individuals. Each person carried a bag containing about 30 pounds of marijuana. At Hernandez\u2019s suggestion, the group walked by night and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>rested by day to avoid detection. One evening, U.S. Border Patrol agents confronted them, and the group scattered. The agents caught Hernandez and another individual and seized eleven bags of marijuana weighing roughly 30 pounds apiece.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">The crux of Hernandez\u2019s argument is that the district court erred in finding that Hernandez possessed all 315 pounds of marijuana seized for sentencing purposes. Hernandez claims that his agreement with Luna extended only to the bundle he was charged with carrying, and that he did not know any of the other individuals carrying the marijuana. Therefore, Hernandez argues he possessed only the bag of marijuana he carried and that his sentence should reflect only that amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(a)(3), the offense level of a defendant convicted of a drug trafficking offense is determined by the quantity of drugs involved in the offense. This quantity includes both drugs with which the defendant was directly involved <em>and </em>drugs that can be attributed to the defendant in a conspiracy as part of his relevant conduct under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l)(B). This section defines relevant conduct as \u201call reasonably foreseeable acts and omissions of others in furtherance of jointly undertaken criminal activity.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l)(B). <em>See United States v. Mir, </em>919 F.2d 940 (5th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">The appellant relies heavily on <em>U.S. v. Evbuomwan, </em>992 F.2d 70 (5th Cir.1993). In <em>Evbuomwan, </em>this court held that in order for conduct to be conspiratorial under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l)(B), the act or omission to be both reasonably foreseeable and within the scope of the defendant\u2019s agreement. <em>Id. </em>at 72. In that case, the defendant\u2019s sentence had been computed by attributing all of the funds stolen in a check fraud scheme. Although the loss attributable to the defendant\u2019s fraud was $1,500, the district court found the defendant to be liable for the $90,-471 pilfered by the entire check fraud scheme. The district court reasoned that the actions of the other participants in the scheme were reasonably foreseeable to the' defendant, and therefore the entire scheme was properly considered relevant conduct under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l)(B). We reversed, stating that mere foreseeability is not a sufficient nexus to find conspiratorial conduct under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l)(B). It is also necessary for the act or omission in the conspiratorial conduct to be within the scope of the defendant\u2019s agreement to undertake criminal activity. <em>Id. </em>at 74. In <em>Evbuomwan, </em>the record did not support a finding that the entire loss attributable to the credit card scheme was within the scope of the defendant\u2019s agreement with his co-conspirators.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-10\">The case at hand is distinguishable from <em>Evbuomwan. </em>While Hernandez originally intended to carry only his bundle, he joined a group of other individuals and together they transported the marijuana. Hernandez accepted his role within the larger unit. Hernandez knew about the other criminal actors, with whom he walked while carrying the marijuana. Hernandez relied on the others for support and assistance, and they relied on him, as demonstrated by Hernandez\u2019s advice to travel at night to avoid detection. Therefore, the criminal enterprise, which included all of the seized marijuana, was reasonably foreseeable to Hernandez and he agreed to be a part of it. The holding in <em>Evbuomwan </em>affords no shelter for Hernandez.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-11\">The facts surrounding Hernandez\u2019s criminal activity falls squarely within the criteria for inclusion within U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lBIBtaXlXB).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In fact, one of the examples in the application notes of that section is factually identical to the case at hand. The example states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-12\">Defendants T, U, V, and W are hired by a supplier to backpack a quantity of marihuana across the border from Mexico into the United States. Defendants T, U, V, and W receive their individual shipments from the supplier at the same time and coordinate their importation efforts by walking across the border together for mutual assistance and protection. Each defendant is accountable for the aggregate quantity of marihuana transported by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>four defendants. The four defendants engaged in a jointly undertaken criminal activity, the object of which was the importation of the four backpacks containing marihuana ... and aided and abetted each other\u2019s actions ... in carrying out the jointly undertaken criminal activity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b661-4\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l)(B), comment, (n. (2)(c)(8)). \u201c[Cjommentary in the Guidelines Manual that interprets or explains a guideline is authoritative unless it violates the Constitution or a federal statute, or is inconsistent with, or a plainly erroneous reading of, that guideline.\u201d <em>Stinson v.
