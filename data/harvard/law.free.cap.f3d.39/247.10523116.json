Shee Atika cross appeals. <em>We </em>dismiss Shee Atika\u2019s cross appeal, and affirm the district court\u2019s order denying Sealaska\u2019s request for an injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-13\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b338-14\">Sealaska is a regional corporation, formed pursuant to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA), 43 U.S.C. \u00a7 1606. Shee Atika is an urban corporation formed under ANCSA, 43 U.S.C. \u00a7 1613(h)(3). Shee Atika owns the surface estate in approximately 22,-000 acres on Admiralty Island, much of which is forested. The subsurface estate, including rock, sand, and gravel, is owned by Sealaska. <em>See </em>43 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1611,1613; <em>Tyonek Native Corp. v. Cook Inlet Region, Inc., </em>863 F.2d 727 (9th Cir.1988). Despite Sealas-ka\u2019s repeated demands, Shee Atika has refused to pay Sealaska for the rock it uses in building roads and other facilities necessary for harvesting timber.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-15\">In 1992, Shee Atika brought this action, seeking a declaration that it has a right to use rock, sand, and gravel from Sealaska\u2019s subsurface estate without paying Sealaska. Sealaska counterclaimed, requesting a permanent injunction prohibiting Shee Atika and those harvesting its timber from taking rock, sand, and gravel without Sealaska\u2019s consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-16\">On February 22, 1993, in response to the parties\u2019 cross-motions for partial summary judgment, the district court denied Sealas-ka\u2019s request for a permanent injunction. Thereafter, Sealaska brought this interlocutory appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1). Shee Atika cross-appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-17\">JURISDICTION</p>\n<p id=\"b338-18\">Both Shee Atika\u2019s cross appeal and Sealaska\u2019s appeal are taken pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1). That statute gives us jurisdiction over:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-19\">Interlocutory orders of the district courts ... granting, continuing, modifying, refusing or dissolving injunctions, or refusing to dissolve or modify injunctions, except where direct review may be had in the Supreme Court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-20\">The district court\u2019s February 22 order specifically denied Sealaska\u2019s request for an injunction. This appeal therefore falls squarely within the language of section 1292(a)(1).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>Relying on <em>Carson v. American Brands Inc., </em>450 U.S. 79, 84, 101 S.Ct. 993, 996-97, 67 L.Ed.2d 59 (1981), however, Shee Atika argues that we do not have jurisdiction to hear Sealaska\u2019s appeal unless Sealaska further demonstrates that the district court\u2019s order threatens it with imminent irreparable injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">Shee Atika\u2019s reliance on <em>Carson </em>is misplaced. In <em>Carson, </em>the Supreme Court considered whether section 1292(a)(1) permitted appeal from an order denying the parties\u2019 joint motion for approval of a consent decree that contained an injunction as one of its provisions. <em>Id. </em>at 80, 101 S.Ct. at 994-95. Because the order did not, on its face, deny an injunction, an appeal from the order did not fall precisely within the language of section 1292(a)(1). The Court nevertheless permitted the appeal. The Court stated that, while section 1292(a)(1) must be narrowly construed in order to avoid piecemeal litigation, it does permit appeals from orders that have the \u201cpractical effect\u201d of denying an injunction, provided that the would-be appellant shows that the order \u201cmight have a serious, perhaps irreparable, consequence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 84, 101 S.Ct. at 997.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">We find nothing in <em>Carson </em>to suggest that the requirement of irreparable injury applies to appeals from orders specifically denying injunctions. <em>Carson </em>merely expanded the scope of appeals that can be taken under section 1292(a)(1), but in so doing imposed an additional requirement on appeals that do not fall directly within the meaning of the statute. Sealaska appeals from the direct denial of a request for an injunction. <em>Carson, </em>therefore, is simply irrelevant.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We conclude that we have jurisdiction over Sea-laska\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">We cannot say the same for Shee Atika\u2019s cross-appeal. The district court\u2019s February 22 order neither denied Shee Atika an, injunction, nor directed Shee Atika to do anything. To the extent that the order has the practical effect of denying Shee Atika an injunction (an argument Shee Atika does not make), Shee Atika makes no showing of irreparable injury as required by <em>Carson. </em>Therefore, we have no jurisdiction to entertain Shee Atika\u2019s cross-appeal. It is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-9\">THE MERITS</p>\n<p id=\"b339-10\">On the merits, Sealaska\u2019s appeal is controlled by our contemporaneous decision in <em>Koniag, Inc. v. Koncor Forest Resource Mgmt. Co., </em>39 F.3d 991 (9th Cir.1994). In that case we held that, where there is no other practical source of rock, sand, and gravel necessary for the development of a surface estate granted to a village corporation under ANCSA, the subsurface is burdened by a servitude whereby its owner may not unreasonably deny the surface owner access to rock, sand, and gravel necessary for surface development.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b339-11\">These conditions obtain here. The parties do not dispute that Shee Atika has no practical source of rock, sand, and gravel other than Sealaska\u2019s subsurface estate. Nor do they dispute that Shee Atika\u2019s land is valuable principally as a source of timber. Finally, th\u00e9y do not dispute that Shee Atika cannot harvest its timber without using rock, sand, and gravel to build roads, logging camps, and other facilities. Accordingly, Shee Atika has a right not to be unreasonably denied access to Sealaska\u2019s rock, sand, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>and gravel to the extent necessary to harvest its timber. <em>See id </em>Sealaska\u2019s requested complete injunction conflicts with this right, and the district court therefore properly denied the injunction without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">No. 93-35258: DISMISSED.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">No. 93-35187: AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b338-12\">. We find no merit in Shee Atika's contention that the district court did not in fact deny Sealas-ka\u2019s request for an injunction, but instead merely deferred ruling on it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b339-7\">. This conclusion is consistent with that reached by the overwhelming majority of courts of appeal that have considered the issue. <em>See Feinstein v. Space Ventures, Inc., </em>989 F.2d 49 n. 1 (1st Cir.1993); <em>United States v. Bay shore Associates, Inc., </em>934 F.2d 1391, 1395-96 (6th Cir.1991); <em>Atwood Turnkey Drilling, Inc. v. Petroleo Brasileiro, </em>S.A., 875 F.2d 1174, 1176 (5th Cir.1989), <em>cert. denied, </em>493 U.S. 1075, 110 S.Ct. 1124, 107 L.Ed.2d 1030 (1990); <em>Tri-State Generation &amp; Transmission Ass\u2019n Inc., v.

The scope of an unreasonable denial is delineated in <em>Koniag. </em>The surface owner must pay a reasonable price for the rock, sand and gravel.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
