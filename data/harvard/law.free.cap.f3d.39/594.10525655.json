GARZA, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b682-9\">After Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (\u201cMetLife\u201d) denied Cynthia Sweatman\u2019s claim for disability benefits, Sweatman brought an action under ERISA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a)(1)(B) (1988), seeking district court review of MetLife\u2019s determination. The court upheld MetLife\u2019s decision, and Sweat-man appeals. We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b682-11\">Cynthia Sweatman worked for Commercial Union Insurance Co. (\u201cCommercial Union\u201d) for nineteen years as a claims adjuster, a job that required her to climb ladders, inspect roofs, and crawl under houses. When Sweat-man stopped working for Commercial Union, she timely submitted a statement of claim for benefits under Commercial Union\u2019s Long Term Disability Plan (\u201cthe Plan\u201d). Sweat-man claimed that her medical condition (listed as rheumatoid arthritis and/or fibrositis) rendered her unable to perform any of her job duties.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b682-13\">Under the terms of the Plan, Sweatman was eligible for long-term disability benefits if she was totally disabled. The Plan defines \u201ctotal disability\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-14\">\u201cTotal Disability\u201d means that during the first 24 months of disability you are unable because of sickness or accident to perform the duties <em>of your own occupation </em>for any employer. Thereafter, \u201ctotal disability\u201d means the inability to perform <em>any occupation </em>for which you are fitted by training, education, or experience.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b682-15\">Record on Appeal, vol. 1, at 48. As claims administrator for the Plan,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> MetLife sought to determine whether Sweatman was in fact \u201ctotally disabled.\u201d Shirley Darvasi, a claim reviewer employed by MetLife, attempted to gather Sweatman\u2019s medical records from her various physicians. At first, this task proved difficult. Dr. Burda, the physician who completed the Attending Physician Statement accompanying Sweatman\u2019s disability claim, did not promptly produce Sweatman\u2019s complete medical records.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-16\">To expedite its review of Sweatman\u2019s claim, MetLife sent the records it had received to Underwriting Medical Actuarial Consultants, Inc. (\u201cUMAC\u201d). Dr. Peter Blendonhy, a board certified physiatrist retained by UMAC, reviewed Sweatman\u2019s medical records and concluded that they did \u201cnot support limitations on work or physical activity.\u201d After UMAC\u2019s peer review board, the \u201cPhysician\u2019s Roundtable,\u201d reviewed and concurred with Dr. Blendonhy\u2019s opinion, UMAC sent MetLife a report summarizing its findings. The report pointed to numerous deficiencies in Sweatman\u2019s medical records and noted that the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis had not been established according to the American Rheumatism Association\u2019s criteria.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-17\">Even after receiving UMAC\u2019s report, Met-Life continued its efforts to obtain Sweat-man\u2019s complete medical records. After repeatedly contacting the physicians listed on Sweatman\u2019s disability claim, MetLife was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>able to gather additional records. Because these records had not been considered by UMAC in its first review, MetLife forwarded the additional records to UMAC for a second review. Dr. Dwyer, an orthopedic surgeon, reviewed the complete records and concluded that they did not support the physical limitations that Sweatman claimed. After its Physician\u2019s Roundtable reviewed and concurred with Dr. Dwyer\u2019s opinion, UMAC issued a second report summarizing its findings. Specifically, UMAC found that Sweatman\u2019s lab work refuted a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis. UMAC also concluded that \u201cthe diagnosis of fibromyositis or fibromyalgia, if accepted, is certainly not substantiated to the degree that would disable Sweatman.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b683-4\">MetLife also hired Equifax Services (\u201cEquifax\u201d) to investigate Sweatman\u2019s claim. An investigator working for Equifax interviewed Sweatman\u2019s neighbors and a local merchant who operated a business across the street from that of Sweatman\u2019s husband. None of these sources knew of Sweatman\u2019s disability. The neighbors reported that Sweatman was taking care of her husband, who was confined to a wheelchair after suffering a stroke, on a full-time basis. The investigator also interviewed Sweatman and reported that she \u201cmoved about with no apparent restrictions or obvious signs of impairments.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">Based on Sweatman\u2019s medical records, the two UMAC reports, the Equifax claim investigation, and its own employment-related information, Darvasi recommended in writing to her supervisor Allen Carson, a MetLife unit claims manager, that Sweatman\u2019s disability claim be denied. Carson reviewed the claim file and agreed that Sweatman was not totally disabled within the meaning of the Plan. MetLife then informed Sweatman by letter of the denial and explained its reasons for denying her claim. MetLife also explained that Sweatman could request reconsideration of her claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">When Sweatman requested review of the denial, MetLife forwarded her file to Laura Sullivan, a \u201cprocedure analyst\u201d at MetLife who had not been involved in the prior decision to deny Sweatman\u2019s claim. Sullivan reviewed the file and upheld the original determination. Consequently, MetLife informed Sweatman by letter of its decision to uphold the earlier denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-12\">Sweatman filed suit under ERISA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a)(1)(B) seeking district court review of MetLife\u2019s disability determination.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After a bench trial submitted on pleadings, depositions, and the administrative record, the court held that MetLife did not abuse its discretion when it denied Sweatman\u2019s claim, and the court entered judgment against Sweatman. Sweatman now appeals, alleging: (1) that the district court erroneously applied an abuse of discretion standard of review to MetLife\u2019s determination, and (2) that even if \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d was the proper standard, MetLife abused its discretion in determining that Sweatman was not \u201ctotally disabled.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b683-13\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b683-14\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b683-15\">Sweatman argues that the district court erroneously applied an abuse of discretion standard of review to MetLife\u2019s denial of her claim. In the Fifth Circuit, the proper standard for district court review of a plan administrator\u2019s benefit determination is governed by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Firestone Tire and Rubber Co. v. Bruch, </em>489 U.S. 101, 109 S.Ct. 948, 103 L.Ed.2d 80 (1989), and our decision in <em>Pierre v. Connecticut General Life Insurance Co., </em>932 F.2d 1552 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 112 S.Ct. 453, 116 L.Ed.2d 470 (1991). In <em>Bruch, </em>the Court held that \u201ca denial of benefits challenged under \u00a7 1132(a)(1)(B) is to be reviewed under a <em>de novo </em>standard unless the benefit plan gives the plan administrator or fiduciary discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits or to construe the terms of the plan.\u201d 489 U.S. at 115, 109 S.Ct. at 956-57. In <em>Pierre, </em>we held \u201cthat for factual determinations under ERISA plans, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>the abuse of discretion standard of review is the appropriate standard.\u201d 932 F.2d at 1562.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Consequently, district courts in the Fifth Circuit review under an abuse of discretion standard a plan administrator\u2019s factual determinations and determinations made pursuant to a plan that gives the administrator discretionary authority to determine eligibility or interpret the terms of the plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">Sweatman concedes that MetLife\u2019s determination that she was not disabled was \u201cmore factual in nature than interpretive in nature,\u201d and therefore is ordinarily subject to abuse of discretion review by the district court under <em>Pierre. </em>However, she argues that two special circumstances in her case warrant heightened scrutiny of MetLife\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">First, Sweatman argues that because she was deprived of the \u201cfull and fair review\u201d of her claim required by ERISA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1133(2) (1988), the district court should have reviewed MetLife\u2019s decision <em>de novo. </em>We do not reach this issue<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> because in this case MetLife conducted a \u201cfull and fair review\u201d of Sweatman\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">Section 1133(2) provides that \u201cevery employee benefit plan shall ... afford a reasonable opportunity to any participant whose claim for benefits has been denied for a full and fair review by the appropriate named fiduciary of the decision denying the claim.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Other circuits have explained that \u201cfull and fair review means \u2018knowing what evidence the decision-maker relied upon, having an opportunity to address the accuracy and reliability of the evidence, and having the decision-maker consider the evidence presented by both parties prior to reaching and rendering his decision.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sage v. Automation, Inc. Pension Plan &amp; Trust, </em>845 F.2d 885, 893-94 (10th Cir.1988) (quoting <em>Grossmuller v. International Union Local 813, </em>715 F.2d 853, 858 n. 5 (3d Cir.1983)).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-12\">Sweatman contends that MetLife\u2019s review of her claim was inadequate because \u201cthe word \u2018review1 contemplates an examination and evaluation of the file by someone other than the various people who initially denied the claim.\u201d This argument is both legally and factually inaccurate. The word \u201creview\u201d does not connote examination by a second party. Instead, \u201creview\u201d means \u201cto view, look at, or look over again.\u201d The Random House College Dictionary 1130 (Rev. ed. 1980); <em>see also </em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1320 (6th ed. 1990) (\u201cReview. To re-examine judicially or administratively. A reconsideration; second view or examination; revision; consideration for purposes of correction.\u201d). We have found no case law supporting Sweat-man\u2019s interpretation of \u201creview\u201d as it appears in \u00a7 1133(2). To the contrary, courts have held that a plan administrator\u2019s reconsideration of its prior decision satisfies \u00a7 1133(2). <em>See, e.g., Brown v. Retirement Comm., </em>797 F.2d 521, 534-35 (7th Cir.1986) (committee\u2019s review of its own decision \u201csatisfied the section 1133 requirement of a full and fair review by the appropriate named fiduciary\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>479 U.S. 1094, 107 S.Ct. 1311, 94 L.Ed.2d 165 (1987); <em>see also Davidson v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number><em>Prudential Ins. Co., </em>953 F.2d 1093, 1096 (8th Cir.1992) (Prudential\u2019s reconsideration of permanent disability claim three times was \u201cfull and fair review\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-4\">Furthermore, even if \u00a7 1133(2) required review by a second decision-maker, MetLife\u2019s procedure did involve such review. As Sweatman acknowledges in her brief, Laura Sullivan, who was not involved in the original disability determination, reviewed Sweat-man\u2019s file and the recommendations of Shirley Darvasi, \u201cthe original claim reviewer.\u201d We cannot agree that a second review of the recommendations of an \u201coriginal reviewer\u201d does not amount to a \u201creview\u201d as contemplated by \u00a7 1133(2).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">Sweatman has not pointed to any other procedural deficiency in MetLife\u2019s review of her claim. Therefore, we hold that the district court properly declined Sweatman\u2019s request that it review MetLife\u2019s decision with heightened scrutiny on the grounds that MetLife failed to comply with \u00a7 1133(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">Sweatman also argues that Met-Life\u2019s inherent conflict of interest as plan administrator and benefit insurer warranted heightened scrutiny by the district court. We have previously held, however, that a conflict of interest does not change the standard of review. <em>See Salley v. E.I. DuPont de Nemours &amp; Co., </em>966 F.2d 1011, 1014 (5th Cir.1992). Instead, the district court should weigh any potential conflict of interest in its determination of whether the plan administrator abused its discretion. <em>Id.; Haubold v. Intermedies, Inc., </em>11 F.3d 1333, 1337 (5th Cir.1994).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In this case, the district court properly reviewed MetLife\u2019s decision under the abuse of discretion standard, weighing MetLife\u2019s conflict of interest as a factor in that review.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-10\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b685-11\">Sweatman argues in the alternative that even if the court applied the proper standard of review, it erroneously concluded that Met-Life did not abuse its discretion. Both parties east our standard of review on appeal as whether the district court\u2019s \u201cfinding\u201d was erroneous. However, Sweatman attacks not the district court\u2019s findings of fact, but rather the district court\u2019s holding that the plan administrator\u2019s denial of benefits was not an abuse of discretion. The posture of this case requires us to clarify the proper standard of review on appeal from a district court\u2019s review of a denial of benefits under \u00a7 1132(a)(1)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-12\">1 '</p>\n<p id=\"b685-13\">The Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Bruch </em>that \u201ca denial of benefits challenged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>under \u00a7 1132(a)(1)(B) is to be reviewed under a <em>de novo </em>standard unless the benefit plan gives the plan administrator or fiduciary discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits or to construe the terms of the plan,\u201d 489 U.S. at 115, 109 S.Ct. at 956-57, describes the district court\u2019s standard of review \u2014 not that of the Court of Appeals.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Plaintiffs who file suit under \u00a7 1132(a)(1)(B) to challenge denials of benefits do so in district court, and the district court reviews the plan administrator\u2019s decision. Then, if a party appeals the district court\u2019s judgment, we review its decision. On appeal, our standard of review for district court decisions reviewing plan administrators\u2019 eligibility determinations is guided by the principles that typically guide our standard of review. Namely, we review questions of law <em>de novo </em>and set aside factual determinations only if clearly erroneous. <em>Odom v. Frank, </em>3 F.3d 839, 843 (5th Cir.1993). Consistent with these principles, we review a district court\u2019s determination of whether a plan administrator abused its discretion \u2014 a mixed question of law and fact\u2014 <em>de novo.</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Our review of the district court\u2019s holding will then require us to apply <em>Bruch </em>and <em>Pierre </em>to determine what standard of review applies to the plan administrator\u2019s decision. <em>See Sandoval v. Aetna Life and Casualty Ins. Co., </em>967 F.2d 377, 380 (10th Cir.1992) (\u201cThe district court\u2019s holding that the administrator\u2019s decision was not arbitrary and capricious is a legal conclusion. Hence, our review of the district court\u2019s decision, although not the underlying administrator\u2019s decision, is plenary.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-9\">Previous cases in this circuit have applied the proper standard of review for potentially conflicting reasons. In some cases, we have applied the <em>Bruch </em>and <em>Pierre </em>tests to determine our standard of review of the plan administrator\u2019s decision. For example, in <em>Vasseur v. Halliburton Co., </em>950 F.2d 1002 (5th Cir.1992), we explained that \u201c[bjecause the applicable plan gives the plan administrator discretion to construe plan terms, the arbitrary and capricious standard applies,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1006, and held that \u201c[t]he plan administrator\u2019s decision ... was not arbitrary and capricious.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1007.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> While these cases properly review the district court\u2019s decision <em>de novo, </em>they only implicitly recognize the fact that as a court of appeals we review the district court\u2019s decision and not the plan administrator\u2019s determination directly.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b686-10\">Other decisions have applied the <em>Bruch </em>standard to determine our standard of review of the <em>district </em>court\u2019s decision. In <em>Schultz v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., </em>872 F.2d 676 (5th Cir.1989), we explained our standard as follows: \u201cNeither party has pointed to any provision in the Plan which gives the administrator discretionary authority to determine benefit eligibility or to construe the plan terms. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s review of the administrator\u2019s denial of the Schultz claim will be tested here based on a <em>de novo </em>standard.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 678; <em>accord Wise v. El Paso Natural Gas Co., </em>986 F.2d 929 (5th Cir.1993) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>(citing <em>Schultz, </em>872 F.2d at 678), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 114 S.Ct. 196, 126 L.Ed.2d 154 (1993). These cases also apply the proper <em>standard </em>\u2014 de <em>novo </em>review of the district court\u2019s decision \u2014 but they imply that if a plan does give the plan administrator discretion, then we would review the district court\u2019s decision under an abuse of discretion standard. However, this implication is inconsistent with the general rule in this circuit that we review mixed questions of law and fact <em>de novo. E.g., United States v. Faubion, </em>19 F.3d 226, 228 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">Finally, some eases have suggested that all actions brought under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a)(1)(B) are reviewed <em>de novo </em>on appeal. <em>See, e.g., Godwin v. Sun Life Assur. Co., </em>980 F.2d 323, 329 (5th Cir.1992) (\u201cBecause this is an action brought under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a)(1)(B), we review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s decision.\u201d) (citing <em>Bruch, </em>489 U.S. at 115, 109 S.Ct. at 956); <em>Jones v. Sonat, Inc. Employee Benefit Plan Admin. Comm., </em>997 F.2d 113, 115 (5th Cir.1993) (same) (citing <em>Goodwin, </em>980 F.2d at 329). Again, while these cases reach the proper <em>result </em>\u2014 de <em>novo </em>review of the district court\u2019s decision upholding or overruling the plan administrator\u2019s decision \u2014 they are potentially misleading because our standard of review does not derive from \u00a7 1132(a)(1)(B).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Furthermore, we apply the \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d standard to a district court\u2019s findings of fact in an action under \u00a7 1132(a)(1)(B). <em>Cathey, </em>907 F.2d at 560.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">In sum, while none of our cases have applied an incorrect standard of review to a district court\u2019s decision in a \u00a7 1132(a)(1)(B) case, their conflicting explanations of the applicable standard of review warrant clarification. The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Bruch </em>and our decision in <em>Pierre </em>determine the proper standard of review in a \u00a7 1132(a)(1)(B) action for review of a plan administrator\u2019s determination of benefits. On appeal from a district court\u2019s judgment in a \u00a7 1132(a)(1)(B) case, our traditional standards of review apply, and we review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s holding on the question of whether the plan administrator abused its discretion or properly denied a claim for benefits. However, we will set aside the district court\u2019s factual findings underlying its review of the plan administrator\u2019s determination only if clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-10\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b687-11\">The parties in this case agree that Sweatman asked the district court to review MetLife\u2019s factual determination that she was not permanently disabled. The district court held that MetLife did not abuse its discretion, a holding we review <em>de novo. See supra </em>part II.B.1. Consequently, under <em>Pierre, </em>we must determine whether MetLife\u2019s decision amounted to an abuse of its discretion. 932 F.2d at 1562. \u201cIn applying the abuse of discretion standard, we analyze whether the plan administrator acted arbitrarily or capriciously.\u201d <em>Salley v. E.I. DuPont de Nemours &amp; Co., </em>966 F.2d 1011, 1014 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-12\">Sweatman essentially argues that MetLife made the wrong decision because it attached insufficient weight to her doctors\u2019 opinions and too much weight to the results of its own investigation, which Sweatman alleges was deficient. MetLife considered all of the medical records Sweatman submitted in support of her disability claim, contracted independent medical consultants to evaluate those records and determine whether they supported her physical limitations,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> hired an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>investigator to interview and investigate Sweatman, and reviewed the entire administrative record twice.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">The record generated by these evaluations contains ample evidence to support MetLife\u2019s finding that Sweatman was not permanently disabled. Specifically, the UMAC reports explained that Sweatman\u2019s own medical records did not support a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis. UMAC\u2019s second report found that \u201cthe diagnosis of fibromyositis or fibro-myalgia, if accepted, is certainly not substantiated to the degree that would disable Sweatman.\u201d After reviewing the record and considering MetLife\u2019s dual role as plan administrator and insurer, we agree with the district court that MetLife\u2019s disability determination was not an abuse of discretion. <em>See Donato v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., </em>19 F.3d 375, 380 (7th Cir.1994) (MetLife\u2019s denial of benefits was not arbitrary and capricious when its \u201cdecision simply came down to a permissible choice between the position of UMAC, MetLife\u2019s independent medical consultant, and the position of [the claimant\u2019s physicians].\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">Citing our decision in <em>Salley, </em>Sweatman argues that MetLife abused its discretion because it failed to obtain necessary information and selectively relied on only part of her treating physicians\u2019 diagnoses. In <em>Salley, </em>the plaintiff, a teenager with a history of emotional disabilities, drug abuse, and depression, had been admitted to a hospital three times for psychiatric care. 966 F.2d at 1012. After she had been hospitalized for almost a month during her third admission, Salley\u2019s treating psychiatrist, Dr. Blundell, found that her condition had improved dramatically. <em>Id. </em>at 1013. However, he concluded she should remain as an inpatient until a suitable environment could be found to avoid a regression to her previous behavior. <em>Id. </em>DuPont ultimately terminated Sal-ley\u2019s inpatient hospitalization benefits based on a determination by Preferred Health Care (\u201cPreferred\u201d) that continued hospitalization was not medically necessary. <em>Id. </em>Preferred\u2019s case manager Ron Schlegel and its psychiatrist Dr. Ahluwalia had spoken with Dr. Blundell about Salley\u2019s improved condition, examined the medical records of Salley\u2019s first admission, and concluded that continued hospitalization was not medically necessary. <em>Id. </em>We held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-9\">[Although DuPont followed the prescribed procedures, it abused its discretion in relying upon the Schlegel and Dr. Ahluwalia recommendation to terminate [Salley\u2019s] benefits. Because they chose to follow Dr. Blundell\u2019s diagnosis, Schlegel and Dr. Ah-luwalia were required, <em>absent independent inquiry, </em>to follow all his advice, not just part of it. If they decided to deviate from his diagnosis, they were required to investigate further the medical necessity of inpatient hospitalization. Whether this investigation included an examination of [Salley] <em>or an analysis of hospital records </em>depended on the particulars of each case. At the very least, however, administrators relying on hospital records obviously must review the most recent records. The case administrator and the physician conceded at trial that they did not do so.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b688-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 1015-16 (emphasis added). In this ease, MetLife investigated Sweatman\u2019s condition and analyzed all of her hospital records. When Sweatman submitted additional records after Dr. Blendonhy\u2019s review, MetLife sought another opinion from UMAC regard<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>ing whether her records supported the physical limitations found by her treating physicians. Furthermore, MetLife did not rely on Sweatman\u2019s physicians\u2019 diagnoses only to ignore their advised treatment. Rather, Met-Life denied Sweatman\u2019s claim for disability benefits based on the opinions of Drs. Dwyer and Blendonhy disagreeing with those of Sweatman\u2019s physicians. Finally, we note that <em>Salley </em>involved a determination of \u201cmedical necessity\u201d and not a claim for disability benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-4\">Sweatman also argues that because she received a percentage of her salary under Commercial Union\u2019s \u201csalary continuation plan,\u201d she is entitled to a presumption of total disability, and that MetLife did not rebut this presumption with evidence of a change in her condition. Sweatman cites no authority for such a rule, and we see no need to create one in this case. Furthermore, there is no evidence in the record that payments under the salary continuation plan depend on a finding of total disability. . The parties stipulated at trial that a beneficiary is entitled to such benefits \u201cin the event of an illness or accident resulting in [the] inability to work.\u201d However, the terms of the salary continuation plan are- not contained in the record, and the Long Term Disability Plan makes no reference to such benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">The remainder of Sweatman\u2019s arguments simply overstate UMAC\u2019s role in MetLife\u2019s disability determination. Sweatman argues that MetLife abused its discretion because Drs. Blendonhy and Dwyer were not asked whether Sweatman was \u201ctotally disabled\u201d but rather only whether her medical records supported the physical limitations she claimed. Sweatman also argues that Drs. Dwyer and Blendonhy were not qualified to determine whether she was \u201ctotally disabled\u201d within the meaning of the Plan because they were not familiar with what her occupation entailed. Both of these arguments are beside the point because MetLife, not Drs. Dwyer and Blen-donhy, was responsible for the ultimate determination of whether Sweatman was \u201ctotally disabled.\u201d MetLife consulted the UMAC physicians only on the question of whether Sweatman\u2019s own records supported the physical limitations that she claimed.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In fact, had MetLife delegated its decision to grant or deny disability benefits to UMAC, it might have run afoul of its fiduciary duty under the Plan. <em>Cf. Salley, </em>966 F.2d at 1014 (\u201cAs long as a company maintains the ultimate decision on denial of benefits, it can be beneficial for it to have experienced agents assist in the determination.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">In sum, in light of the ample evidence supporting MetLife\u2019s \u201ctotal disability\u201d determination, and recognizing MetLife\u2019s dual role as claims administrator and insurer, we hold that the district court properly upheld Met-Life\u2019s denial of Sweatman\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-8\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b689-9\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b682-12\">. Pending determination of her disability claim, Sweatman received a percentage of her salary under Commercial Union\u2019s \u201csalary continuation plan,\u201d which provided for such payments \"in the event of an illness or accident resulting in [the] inability to work.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b682-18\">.

Sweatman cites no authority for the proposition that noncompliance with \u00a7 1133(2) would warrant heightened scrutiny of MetLife's disability determination. In <em>Weaver v. Phoenix Home Life Mutual Insurance Co., </em>990 F.2d 154 (4th Cir.1993), the Fourth Circuit held that a plan administrator's noncompliance with \u00a7 1133(1) was evidence of abuse of discretion, but the court did not apply a heightened standard of review. <em>See id. </em>at 158-59.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b684-10\">.

Sweatman also argues that Sullivan could not have adequately reviewed Sweatman\u2019s claim because \"Paragraph 6 of her affidavit states that, \u2018based upon my ERISA review of MetLife's denial decision, MetLife again determined that Ms. Sweatman was not totally disabled from performing her job and, therefore, upheld the decision to deny benefits.\u2019 \u201d This statement is inaccurate, according to Sweatman, because Drs. Dwyer and Blendonhy \"did not base their decisions upon any conclusion that she wasn't disabled but, in fact, denied the claim because they did not believe there were sufficient records of medical findings to support the disability opinion offered by plaintiff\u2019s treating physicians.\" This argument assumes that UMAC played a greater role than it actually did in MetLife\u2019s disability determination process. MetLife asked Drs. Dwyer and Blendonhy to review Sweatman\u2019s medical records to ascertain whether the documents supported Sweatman's claimed physical limitations. With the benefit of these opinions, MetLife, the plan administrator, made the ultimate determination that Sweatman was not totally disabled. <em>See infra </em>part II.B.2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b685-14\">. <em>See also Duhon v.

Blendon-hy and Dwyer review twenty to thirty files per month for UMAC, they are \"financially dependent upon UMAC [which, Sweatman argues, is in turn financially dependent on MetLife] and ... by no means 'independent' or \u2018impartial.\u2019 \u201d This argument lacks merit. First, UMAC\u2019s doctors are independent consultants because MetLife hires UMAC on a contractual basis. Second, even assuming the issue were relevant, Sweat-man points to no evidence in the record that proves that Drs. Dwyer and Blendonhy are \"financially dependent\u201d on UMAC or that UMAC depends on MetLife. The number of files they review per month proves nothing about their financial status. Finally, we note that the only way for MetLife to satisfy Sweatman\u2019s standard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>for impartiality would be to seek physicians willing to volunteer their time to review the medical files of disability claimants.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">Sweatman also argues that Dr. Blendonhy\u2019s opinion is worthless because he did not review all of Sweatman\u2019s medical records. It is true that Dr. Blendonhy examined only those records that Sweatman had submitted to MetLife at the time of his review. However, when Sweatman submitted additional records, some of which filled gaps identified by Dr. Blendonhy, MetLife resubmitted the complete records for UMAC's consideration. Sweatman does not dispute that Dr. Dwyer based his opinion on all of the records Sweatman submitted to MetLife. Consequently, even if Dr. Blendonhy's opinion were based on an insufficient record. Dr. Dwyer's opinion and MetLife\u2019s ultimate benefit determination were based on Sweatman's complete medical records.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-12\">Sweatman also contends that UMAC\u2019s \u201cPhysician's Roundtable\u201d has no evidentiary value whatsoever, and in fact \"is nothing more than a bucket of whitewash which is legitimated by the professional degrees of those that participate.\u201d However, Sweatman's characterization of UMAC's peer review process does not change the fact that UMAC's report contains ample evidence supporting MetLife\u2019s determination.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"AVhM\">. Sweatman also argues that Drs. Dwyer and Blendonhy were not qualified to render their opinions because they do not practice in Louisiana where Sweatman was diagnosed and do not specialize in the same areas as her primary treating physicians. These arguments similarly assume too great a role for UMAC\u2019s physicians. Drs. Blendonhy and Dwyer were asked to determine only whether the contents of Sweatman's medical records supported her claimed physical limitations. Sweatman fails to show that Drs. Blendonhy and Dwyer were not qualified to make this limited determination.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
