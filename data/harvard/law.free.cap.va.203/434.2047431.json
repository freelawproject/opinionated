The motion was overruled and judgment entered upon the verdict. We granted the company a writ of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">The sole question involved, which will be hereinafter stated, brings under review \u00a7 38.1-336, Code of 1950, 1953 Replacement Volume, which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-7\">\u201cWHEN ANSWERS OR STATEMENTS OF APPLICANT NOT TO BAR RECOVERY ON POLICY.-AU statements, declarations and descriptions in any application for a policy of insurance or for the reinstatement thereof shall be deemed representations and not warranties, and no statement in such application or in any affidavit made before or after loss under the policy shall bar a recovery upon a policy of insurance, or be construed as a warranty, anything in the policy to the contrary notwithstanding, unless it be clearly proved that such answer or statement was material to the risk when assumed and was untrue.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">The trial court instructed the jury, without objection, that the answers or statements contained in the application were untrue, thus leaving the only question to be decided: Were the statements material to the risk when assumed?</p>\n<p id=\"b527-9\">The questions involved in the application were A8 and AlO(i), which questions and answers follow:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-10\">\u201cA8. When did you last consult a physician or practitioner? Feb. 1958</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-11\">Name of physician or practitioner? Forgotten</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aez\">Address of physician or practitioner? Paris Island, S. C.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A-h\">Illness? Normal Discharge USMC</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ayq_\">Details? Found Normal</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-12\">\u201cAlO(i). Have you consulted any physicians or practitioners the</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>past five years for any other causes? No.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">The record discloses that Harris had consulted Dr. Jacob J. Hladys, at his office in Richmond, on November 14, December 5, 12, 19, 23, 26 and 30, in 1958; January 9, 16, 23, 30, February 2, 6, 10, 13, and 20, in 1959. Thus, between November 14, 1958 and January 28, 1959, the date of the application, Harris had visited Dr. Hladys ten times, and after the application saw him an additional six times, the last visit being on February 20, 1959, which was two days prior to his death. In addition to this, he had been receiving psychiatric treatment while a member of the United States Marine Corps for about a year and a half, and had also consulted a Dr. Masters at Tucker Hospital in Richmond.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">A summary diagnosis of Harris\u2019 illness was set forth in a letter from Dr. Hladys on July 20, 1960 (Plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit 2) as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-7\">\u201cDiagnosis \u2014 Psychoneurosis, Anxiety type, Mild.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-8\">Treatment \u2014 Psychotherapy 1-1 <em>/2 </em>hours. No medication was necessary: Was receiving Psychiatric treatment at time of death \u2014 February 22, 1959.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b528-9\">Additional facts testified to by Dr. Hladys were: Harris was referred to him by Dr. Hodges, associate pastor at First Baptist Church. Dr. Hodges felt Harris was seclusive, withdrawn, shy, extremely nervous and needed psychiatric help.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-10\">Dr. Hladys\u2019 findings were summarized as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-11\">\u201cWell, his symptoms when he came to me were symptoms of nervousness, anxiety, and tension, feelings of insecurity, feelings of inferiority and depression, and having a tendency to be by himself, being uncomfortable around people, and hating his father and mother. * * * Harris\u2019 make up is a picture of what we call a schizoid type of personality.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b528-12\">The characteristics outlined by Dr. Hladys were largely corroborated by the plaintiff and one of her witnesses, John C. Crawford, a friend of Harris.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-13\">In answer to a question propounded by the court Dr. Hladys said that with a person like Harris \u201cyou are always faced with the factor that the patient in his condition could commit suicide;\u201d that his chances for a satisfactory marriage were \u201cimpossible\u201d without adequate treatment, and that \u201che would not ever have been able to live a normal life.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b528-14\">Dr. Robert M. Miskimon, the Underwriting Vice President and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>Medical Director for the insurance company, testified that an essential part of the underwriting information in determining whether or not the policy should be written was the application, particularly since no medical examination was required; that there was nothing in the application or any other paper before the company \u201cwhich in any way reveals that Alan Harris was under treatement with Dr. Jacob J. Hladys;\u201d that if the name of Dr. Hladys had been revealed in the answers to Questions A8 and AlO(i) the policy would not have been issued \u201cwithout first contacting Dr. Hladys for a report;\u201d that had he known about Dr. Hladys and the numerous visits Harris had paid to him wherein the condition had been diagnosed \u201cPsychoneurosis, Anxiety type, Mild\u201d he would not have issued the policy at the present time, but rather would have waited about a year; that the reason he would have declined to issue the policy at the present time was \u201cbecause of the increased mortality of people who have this situation, this condition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\">The evidence further disclosed that had the company issued the policy at all, an extra premium would have been charged to cover \u201cwhat we thought would be the extra mortality rating,\u201d which \u201cwould probably be at least twice the usual mortality.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">In addition to Dr. Miskimon\u2019s testimony, Dr. Ennion S. Williams, Vice President and Medical Director of the Life Insurance Company of Virginia, and Raymond G. Cleek, Chief Underwriter and Assistant Secretary of Atlantic Life Insurance Company, testified, without objection, that under no circumstances would their companies have written the policy before receiving a statement from Dr. Hladys concerning his treatment of Harris, and that had the policy been issued at all it would have been \u201cdouble the mortality rating.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">There was no evidence introduced by the plaintiff to refute the foregoing testimony and since, as aforesaid, the trial court properly instructed the jury that the answers to the questions were untrue, the only remaining question was whether or not it had been clearly proved that such answers were material to the risk when assumed, as required by Code, \u00a7 38.1-336, 1953 Replacement Volume.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">We hold that the record discloses, without contradiction, that the answers were material to the risk, and the motion to strike plaintiff\u2019s evidence should have been sustained. As said in <em>Inter-Ocean Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Harkrader </em>(1951), 193 Va. 96, 100, 101, 67 S. E. 2d 894, 897:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-8\">\u201cRepresentations in an application for a policy of insurance should not only be true but full. The insurer has the right to know the whole truth. If a true disclosure is made, it is put on guard to make its own <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>inquiries, and determine whether or not the risk should be assumed. A misstatement of material facts by the applicant takes away its opportunity to estimate the risk under its contract. A knowledge or ignorance of such facts would naturally and reasonably influence the judgment of the insurer in making the contract or in establishing the degree or character of the risk or in fixing the rate of premium.\u201d (Citing an array of Virginia cases.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">In the instant case, the failure to truthfully answer Questions A8 and AlO(i) deprived the insurance company of the opportunity of making even a basic estimate of the risk involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">As stated in Vance, Law of Insurance (Anderson 3rd Ed. 1951) Section 62, page 376:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-6\">\u201cIf the knowledge of a fact would cause the insurer to reject the risk, or to accept it only at a higher premium rate, that fact is material, though it may not even remotely contribute to the contingency upon which the insurer would become liable, or in any wise affect the risk.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">See also <em>Standard Accident Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Walker </em>(1920), 127 Va. 140, 147, 102 S. E. 585; <em>Flannagan </em>v. <em>Northwestern Mutual Ins. Co. </em>(1929), 152 Va. 38, 68, 146 S. E. 353.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">Plaintiff relies upon our decision in <em>Scott </em>v. <em>State Farm Mutual </em>(1961), 202 Va. 579, 118 S. E. 2d 519. The <em>Scott </em>case, contrary to plaintiff\u2019s interpretation, supports our conclusion in the instant case. At page 583 in the <em>Scott </em>case, we distinguish it from the holding in <em>Didlake </em>v. <em>Standard Ins. Co. </em>(10th Cir., 1952), 195 F. 2d 247, 33 A. L. R. 2d 941. There we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-9\"><em>\u201c* * * </em>(E)vidence was introduced [in the <em>Didlake </em>case] on behalf of the insurance company that it would not have issued the policy if it had known that the true owner of the car was a minor, unmarried, and away from home on duty with the Army, since he would have been considered a bad risk.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-10\">At page 584, the opinion in the <em>Scott </em>case continues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-11\">\u201cIn each of the Virginia cases hereinbefore cited supporting the principle that a misrepresentation of facts material to the risk voids an insurance contract, there was positive proof that the company would not have written the policy if it had known the true facts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-12\">It will be seen that in the <em>Scott </em>case the insurance company presented no evidence that it would have rejected the risk or charged a higher premium if it had been revealed in the application that the true owner of the car was a minor.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-13\">In the instant case there is positive proof that the insurance com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>pany would not have issued the policy had it known the true facts, and this evidence is not controverted. Thus the question of materiality became one of law for the court. <em>Inter-Ocean Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Harkrader, supra, </em>193 Va., at page 102, 67 S. E. 2d, at page 898.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\">For the reasons stated the verdict is set aside, the judgment reversed and final judgment entered here for the insurance company.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">\n<em>Reversed and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
