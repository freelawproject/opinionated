A trial by jury resulted in a verdict of $2000 for Faulkner, on which the trial court entered judgment, and John Doe is here on a writ of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">The sole question presented is whether the defendant, John Doe, is a party incapable of testifying as contemplated under \u00a7 8-286<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>, Code of 1950, so that no judgment can be rendered for Faulkner on his uncorroborated testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">The evidence shows that the accident occurred on the morning of October 9,, 1960, between the hours of 5 and 6 o\u2019clock, at the intersection of Brambleton avenue and Tidewater drive in the city of Norfolk.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">Faulkner testified that he was alone in. his automobile heading west on Brambleton avenue, which was wet at the time, at a speed of 25 to 30 miles per hour, with the traffic light at the intersection showing green. While he was proceeding around a traffic circle at the intersection, a southbound vehicle ran the red light, and in an effort to avoid a collision he swerved his car and applied the brakes. When he attempted to right his car it skidded and went up on the sidewalk on the north side of Brambleton avenue and struck the guy wire supporting a utility pole. There was no contact between the Faulkner automobile and the other vehicle, and its operator is unknown. Faulkner was knocked unconscious as a result of the accident and he was later carried to the hospital by a police officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">Faulkner\u2019s testimony of how the accident occurred is uncorroborated.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-9\">The only other evidence presented was the testimony of the investigating officer, who testified that Faulkner described the accident to him as having occurred when he was traveling at 35 to 40 miles per hour, and while attempting to negotiate the traffic circle the steering mechanism of his automobile locked, causing it to get out of control and collide with the guy wire.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-10\">The jury\u2019s verdict settled this conflict in the evidence in favor of Faulkner.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-11\">The defendant, John Doe, contends, through the Nationwide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>Mutual Insurance Company, not a named party defendant to this action but given the right to file pleadings in the name of John Doe as an insurer of Faulkner under the Uninsured Motorist Law<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>, that the trial court erred in entering judgment on the verdict of the jury which was founded solely on the uncorroborated testimony of Faulkner, the interested party.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">The defendant concedes that there is nothing in the Uninsured Motorist Law requiring corroboration of Faulkner\u2019s testimony, but says that the legislature is presumed to have had knowledge of the existence of the requirement of corroboration under Code \u00a7 8-286 and it did not see fit to exempt \u00a7 38.1-381, as amended,, from its operation. Hence he argues that \u00a7 8-286 is applicable in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">Section 8-286 first appeared in the Code of 1919 as \u00a7 6209. The revisors of the Code of 1919, recognizing that many of the difficulties in practice had arisen out of the exceptions to the rule that interest should not disqualify a witness, submitted in its draft to the General Assembly at its 1918 session recommendations for material changes in the law governing the competency of witnesses which removed all disqualifications, except confidential communications, particularly between husband and wife, by the repeal of certain then existing statutes. But in order to meet the problems that would arise in affording ample protection for estates of persons laboring under disabilities, or who were incapable of testifying, the revisors deemed it necessary to add \u00a7 6209, now \u00a7 8-286. <em>Hoge, Adm'r </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>200 Va. 364, 369, 370, 106 S. E. 2d 121, 124, 125; <em>Robertson </em>v. <em>Atlantic, Etc., Realty Co., </em>129 Va. 494, 503, 504, 106 S. E. 521, 522-524; 5 Va. Law Reg. (N. S.) 125, 126; 39 Va. L. Rev. 395.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">In <em>Robertson </em>v. <em>Atlantic, Etc., Realty Co., supra, </em>this Court said, in an opinion which has been frequently cited, that: \u201cThe purpose of the section [Code \u00a7 6209, which is now \u00a7 8-286, Code of 1950, 1957 Replacement Volume] was to remove disqualifications, not to create them in any case, nor to impose burdens on witnesses already competent.\u201d 129 Va. at p. 504, 106 S. E. at p. 524. <em>Union Trust Corporation </em>v. <em>Fugate, </em>172 Va. 82, 90, 200 S. E. 624, 627.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-8\">We do not agree with the argument that Faulkner\u2019s testimony must be corroborated under the requirement of \u00a7 8-286 in order for the judgment to be upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-9\">John Doe is a fiction created by law to stand in the place of an unknown party who has caused bodily injury or property damage by the negligent operation of a motor vehicle. As a fictional charac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>ter, he is not a person (Code \u00a7 1-13(19)), but he speaks, by virtue of the uninsured motorist statute, through the insurance company, and the company speaks through him. <em>John Doe </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>203 Va. 508, 513, 125 S. E. 2d 159, 163, this day decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">The operator of the \u201cJohn Doe automobile\u201d is unavailable because his identity is unknown. The word <em>unavailable </em>is not synonymous with the word <em>incapable </em>used in the statute. A witness or party to a proceeding may be unavailable for various reasons, but he is not <em>incapable </em>simply because he is <em>unavailable.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">Section 8-286 was adopted to provide protection for estates of <em>persons </em>laboring under disability, or who are <em>incapable </em>of testifying. John Doe is not a person laboring under disability or incapable of testifying. Hence the statute has no application in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">For the reasons stated, the judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b617-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b614-17\"> Code, 1960 Cum.
