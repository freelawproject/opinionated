The appellants were not employees of the company but they participated in the picketing. They contend that paragraph three of \u00a7 40-64 is unconstitutional. They concede that its constitutionality was expressly sustained in <em>Dougherty </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>199 Va. 515, 100 S. E. 2d 754 (1957). They say in their brief: \u201cThe facts in the <em>Dougherty </em>case are incapable of valid distinction from the cases of Waxman, Giordano, Correll and Spence,\u201d the cases now before the court; and \u201cIf this court shall find in their favor, it must overrule its prior decision in <em>Dougherty </em>v. <em>Commonwealth. </em>There is no escape from this conclusion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">The <em>Dougherty </em>case was carefully considered and the conclusion reached was in our opinion correct. For the reasons therein stated we again hold that paragraph three of \u00a7 40-64 is constitutional and the judgments of conviction appealed from are accordingly</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
