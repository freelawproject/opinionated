Dowdy, filed a motion for judgment against G. A. Franklin, Stanley Roscoe Early and Frances F. Mathena, Administrator d.b.n. of the Estate of Phillip Leroy Dowdy, Deceased, hereinafter referred to as the defendants, to recover damages for personal injuries sustained when the automobile operated by Phillip Leroy Dowdy, in which the plaintiff was riding, was in a collision on August 6, 1958, in the city of Radford, with the truck owned by the defendant G. A. Franklin and operated by his agent, the defendant Stanley Roscoe Early.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">The motion for judgment alleged the concurring negligence of the deceased and Early as the proximate cause of plaintiff\u2019s injuries. The defendants filed pleas in abatement to the motion for judgment, which were sustained by the trial court after hearing evidence and argument thereon, and the motion for judgment was dismissed. The plaintiff was granted a writ of error to the action of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">In the accident in which plaintiff is alleged to have sustained his injuries his brother, Phillip Leroy Dowdy, the operator of the automobile, was killed. On June 27, 1959, William Dowdy, the father of the deceased, qualified as administrator of his son\u2019s estate in the Circuit Court of Montgomery County, where the plaintiff, the administrator and the defendants Franklin and Early all resided, and where the deceased had resided at the time of his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-9\">On May 28, 1960, William Dowdy filed a petition in the Circuit Court of Montgomery County seeking acceptance of his resignation as administrator and on the same date an order was entered revoking and annulling his authority as such administrator. Frances F. Mathena, a resident of Roanoke County, then qualified as administrator d.b.n.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-10\">On July 7, 1960, the motion for judgment in the action now before us was filed against Franklin and Early, and against Mrs. Mathena, as administrator, in the Circuit Court of Roanoke County.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-11\">The pleas in abatement filed by the defendants attacked the venue in Roanoke County, asserting that the cause of action did not arise there, that the defendants Franklin and Early did not reside there, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>and that the personal residence of the defendant administrator was not sufficient to afford proper venue.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">It is conceded by the defendants that since plaintiff\u2019s cause of action arose in the city of Radford, his action might also have been brought in chat jurisdiction, under authority of \u00a7 8-39,(<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>) Code of Virginia, 1950, as amended.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">The sole question to be determined is whether an action against an \u2022\u25a0administrator, in his official capacity, may be brought in a county or icily where the sole ground of venue is the personal residence of the administrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">In this Commonwealth, venue is controlled entirely by statute. The \u00a1pertinent provisions of the Code of Virginia, 1950, as amended, which must be considered in determining the question before us, are found in \u00a7 8-38.(<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>)</p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">The plaintiff contends that under \u00a7 8-38 (1), Roanoke County <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>was the proper venue for his action, since Mrs. Mathena, the administrator, personally resided there. He argues that \u00a7 8-38 (1) and \u00a7 8-38 (5) are merely cumulative, and that his action could have been brought either in Roanoke County, where the administrator resided, or in Montgomery County, where she qualified.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">We have not had occasion before to pass upon the precise question here presented. Since it appears that the statute under consideration is ambiguous, it is necessary that we ascertain the intent of the legislature in its enactment of \u00a7 8-38, and resolve the ambiguity.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">In ascertaining the legislative intent, elementary rules require that we give weight to the object of the statute and the purpose to be accomplished thereby. We must consider the specific language used and give effect thereto. Our construction should be reasonable, so that the purpose of the enactment will not be limited or defeated, but instead will be promoted. <em>Bott </em>v. <em>Hampton Roads San. Comm., </em>190 Va. 775, 783, 58 S. E. 2d 306, 309, 310; <em>Norfolk So. Ry Co. </em>v. <em>Lassiter, </em>193 Va. 360, 364, 68 S. E. 2d 641, 643, 644.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">The legislature, in its enactment of \u00a7 8-38, has provided for the proper venue of an action or suit against all classes of defendants, individual, corporate, governmental and fiduciary; of an action or suit by the Commonwealth, and of specific classes of actions or suits, i.e., those involving insurance policies, lands and wills and administrations.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">An examination of \u00a7 8-38 makes it clear that the objective sought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>to be attained by the legislature was to provide an orderly, practical and appropriate method for determining the proper venue of an action or suit, with the purpose in mind to insure to a litigant, insofar as possible, his right to have his case tried in a convenient and familiar jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">In the case of an administrator of the estate of a deceased person, the most convenient and familiar jurisdiction is, logically and legally, that in which the administrator qualifies, since it is, <em>a fortiori, </em>the place of last residence of the deceased in whose place and stead, for the purposes of actions or suits against the estate, the administrator stands, and is at the same time the source of the administrator\u2019s authority and the place where he must state and settle his accounts. The administrator serves in an official capacity which may only arise from and be terminated by the court of the county or city in which he qualifies. His official residence, for purposes of venue, is in that county or city.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">We are of the opinion that it was the plain legislative intent that \u00a7 8-38 (1) should apply to an action or suit against a defendant solely in his individual capacity, and that in enacting \u00a7 8-38 (5) the legislature has \u201cotherwise especially provided\u201d for the venue of an action or suit against an administrator in his official capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">In our neighboring state of West Virginia, whose venue statute contains a provision similar to \u00a7 8-38 (1) but which does not contain one similar to \u00a7 8-38 (5), the Supreme Court of Appeals has ruled in the case of <em>Charter </em>v. <em>Doddridge County Bank et al., </em>119 W.Va. 735, 196 S. E. 158, that the receiver of a bank (to whom our \u00a7 8-38 (5) would be applicable) must be sued in the county or city where he qualifies, and in the case of <em>Charlotton et al. </em>v. <em>Gordon et al., </em>120 W. Va. 615, 200 S. E. 740, 741, that an administrator may only be sued in his official capacity in the county or city where he qualifies.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">In the <em>Charter </em>case, <em>supra, </em>the plaintiff took the position that he had the unqualified right, under the West Virginia statute, to prosecute his action in the county where the receiver personally resided which, as in the case before us, was not the county in which the fiduciary had qualified. Maxwell, President, speaking for the court, said, \u201cWe think that impractical results would follow the construction urged by the plaintiff.....[I]t would be highly impractical and not in conformity with orderly and convenient administration of justice to permit a claim against the bank to be prosecuted in the far distant county of the receiver\u2019s personal residence, merely because of such personal residence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>Although the courts of other of our sister states have held to the contrary, 34 C.J.S., Executors and Administrators, 724, Sec. 727, 92 C.J.S., Venue, 763, Sec. 58, we think the better conclusion has been reached by the West Virginia court, which we approve.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">We therefore hold that Roanoke County was not the proper venue of plaintiff\u2019s action and that the trial judge properly sustained defendants\u2019 pleas in abatement. His action in doing so is, accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b101-9\"> \u00a7 8-39. Where cause of action arose. \u2014 An action or suit may be brought in any county or city wherein the cause of action, or any part thereof, arose, although none of the defendants reside therein.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b101-10\"> \u00a7 8-38.
