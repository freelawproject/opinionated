Boylen challenges the enhancement of his sentence for possessing a firearm in connection with his drug sales and the reasonableness of his sentence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-4\">The district court did not clearly err when it enhanced Boylen\u2019s sentence for possessing a firearm in connection with his drug sales. A defendant is subject to a 4-point increase in his base offense level if he \u201c[u]sed or possessed any firearm or ammunition in connection with another felony offense; or possessed or transferred any firearm or ammunition with knowledge, intent, or reason to believe that it would be used or possessed in connection with another felony offense.\u201d United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6)(B) (Nov.2011). On several occasions, Boylen offered to sell firearms and drugs to an undercover detective of the Hillsborough County Sheriffs Office and completed the sales in simultaneous or virtually simultaneous transactions. Undoubtedly, the firearms \u201cfacilitated\u201d Boy-len\u2019s drug sales and \u201chad the potential of facilitating\u201d future drug sales for Boylen. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2K2.1 cmt n. 14(A). The district court reasonably inferred that Boylen \u201cwas in the business of supplying both drugs and firearms\u201d and was willing to supply both to earn \u201cand to maintain [the detective\u2019s] confidence and business.\u201d <em>United States v. Thompson, </em>32 F.3d 1, 7-8 (1st Cir.1994) (cited in <em>United States v. Matos-Rodriguez, </em>188 F.3d 1300, 1308 (11th Cir. 1999)).</p>\n<p id=\"b974-5\">Boylen\u2019s sentence is procedurally and substantively reasonable. The district stated it had read the presentence investigation report and, after considering the parties\u2019 arguments and the sentencing factors, had decided to impose a sentence at the low end of Boylen\u2019s advisory guidelines range of 87 to 108 months of imprisonment. Boylen requested that the district court vary downward from the guideline range, but the district court explained that Boylen\u2019s \u201cbad childhood\u201d was \u201cnot a reason to break the law\u201d and that Boylen \u201chad been in trouble\u201d before his \u201cdirt-bike accident\u201d that affected his ability to \u201cearn[ ] a living.\u201d The district court reasonably determined that a sentence of 87 months of imprisonment was necessary to address Boylen\u2019s crimes of \u201cselling guns\u201d and drugs; the seriousness of selling firearms, \u201cespecially sawed-off shotguns and guns with obliterated serial numbers,\u201d which \u201calways [poses] a danger for the community\u201d; and the seriousness of selling \u201cEcstasy.\u201d <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). And Boylen\u2019s sentence is well below his maximum statutory punishment, which suggests that the sentence is reasonable. <em>See United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir.2008). Boylen argues that he should have received a lesser sentence like his cohort, Rachel Lancaster, but Boy-len is not similarly situated to Lancaster. <em>See United States v. Docampo, </em>573 F.3d 1091, 1101-02 (11th Cir.2009). Boylen pleaded guilty to selling drugs and firearms, but Lancaster provided information that led to arrests of two individuals and then pleaded guilty in a state court to only a drug offense. The district court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-7\">We AFFIRM Boylen\u2019s sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
