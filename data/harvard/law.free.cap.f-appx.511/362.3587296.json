The district court determined that Cade was a career offender under the Sentencing Guidelines but varied from the guidelines range and sentenced Cade to 216 months of imprisonment on Count 1 and to 60 months on Count 2, to run consecutively to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>the sentence imposed on Count 1. Cade now moves for leave to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) on appeal from the denial of his motion for a reduction of sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">By so moving, Cade challenges the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal was not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). Our inquiry into a litigant\u2019s good faith \u201cis limited to whether the appeal involves legal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">To the extent Cade argues that he is eligible for a sentence reduction based on the Fair Sentencing Act\u2019s (FSA) changes to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b), his argument fails. Because Cade was sentenced before the FSA\u2019s August 3, 2010, effective date, it is not retroactively applicable to him. <em>See Dorsey v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 2321, 2335-36, 183 L.Ed.2d 250 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-10\">The district court has discretion to reduce a sentence \u201cin the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. [\u00a7 ] 994(o).\u201d \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Cade argues that the application of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c), as amended by the Sentencing Commission, would lower his total offense level from 31 to 29. However, his total offense level under the career offender guideline remains 34, and because this offense level is higher than that calculated under \u00a7 2D1.1, the career offender offense level \u201cshall apply.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(b)(A). Because of the operation of the career offender guideline, any reduction under \u00a7 2Dl.l(c), as amended, \u201cdoes not have the effect of lowering [Cade\u2019s] applicable guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, p.s., comment. (n.l(A)). Thus, he is ineligible for a sentence reduction. <em>See id.; </em>\u00a7 3582(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-12\">Moreover, \u201c[t]he crack cocaine guideline amendments do not apply to prisoners sentenced as career offenders.\u201d <em>United States v. Anderson, </em>591 F.3d 789, 791 (5th Cir.2009). Cade\u2019s reliance on <em>Freeman v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2685, 180 L.Ed.2d 519 (2011), is misplaced as nothing in <em>Freeman </em>concerns defendants sentenced as career offenders or alters this court\u2019s holding in <em>Anderson. See id. </em>at 2690-700.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-15\">Cade is clearly ineligible for \u00a7 3582(c) relief. Accordingly, his motion for leave to proceed IFP is denied, and the appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 <em>&amp; </em>n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-16\">IFP MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b384-23\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
