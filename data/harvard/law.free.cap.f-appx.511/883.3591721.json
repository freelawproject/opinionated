Count 5 charged the Defendants with conspiracy to use, carry, and possess a firearm in furtherance of a drug-trafficking crime, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A) and (o). After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-10\">I. BACKGROUND FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b906-11\">Following a jury trial, the Defendants were convicted of: (1) conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 (Count 1); (2) attempted possession with intent to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2 (Count 2); (8) conspiracy to interfere with commerce by threats or violence, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951(a) (Count 3); (4) attempt to interfere with commence by threats or violence, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1951(a) and 2 (Count 4); (5) conspiracy to use, carry, and possess a firearm in furtherance of a drug-trafficking crime, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A) and (o) (Count 5); and (6) using, carrying, and possessing a firearm in furtherance of a drug-trafficking crime, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 924(c)(1)(A) and 2 (Count 6). In addition, Ortiz and Rolon were each convicted of one count of being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g) and 924(e) (Counts 8 and 9, respectively).</p>\n<p id=\"b906-12\">The district court sentenced Ortiz to: (1) concurrent life sentences on Counts 1, 2, 5 and 8; (2) concurrent 240-month sentences on Counts 3 and 4; and (3) a consecutive life sentence on Count 6. Rolon was sentenced identically to concurrent life sentences on Counts 1, 2, 5 and 9, to concurrent 240-month sentences on Counts 3 and 4, and a mandatory, consecutive life sentence on Count 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-13\">A. First Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b906-14\">In the Defendants\u2019 first appeal before this Court, the Defendants raised multiple conviction and sentencing issues. As to their convictions, Ortiz and Rolon challenged: (1) the indictment; (2) the closing arguments; (3) two jury instructions; and (4) the <em>Allen </em>charge. As to their sen-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>fences, the Defendants argued that: (1) Ortiz\u2019s prior conviction for resisting an officer with violence was no longer a predicate offense qualifying him for career offender status under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2; (2) Ortiz\u2019s life sentences were substantively unreasonable; (3) Rolon should not have been subject to a mandatory consecutive life sentence on Count 6 pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559(c) because two of his prior convictions were not validated at sentencing; and (4) Rolon\u2019s consecutive life sentence on Count 6 violated the Eighth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-5\">We affirmed \u201call of Ortiz\u2019s and Rolon\u2019s convictions and sentences except as to their [life] sentences on Count 5,\u201d which we concluded exceeded the applicable 240-month statutory maximum in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(o). <em>See United States v. Rolon, </em>445 Fed.Appx. 314, 318 n. 4, 332 (11th Cir. 2011), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 1818, 182 L.Ed.2d 635 (2012) <em>(\u201cRolon I </em>\u201d). Accordingly, we vacated \u201cOrtiz\u2019s and Rolon\u2019s sentences as to Count 5 and REMAND[ED] to the district court for resen-tencing on Count 5.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 332.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-8\">B. Remand Before the District Court</p>\n<p id=\"b907-9\">On remand, the Defendants asked for sentences significantly below the 240-month statutory maximum applicable to Count 5 due to their post-sentencing rehabilitation and in light of the severity of the sentences already imposed on their other counts. Although the Defendants agreed that this Court\u2019s remand limited the district court to resentencing only on Count 5, they also argued that their life sentences on other counts violated the Eighth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-10\">On remand, the district court refused to entertain the Defendants\u2019 arguments with respect to counts other than Count 5, stating that the matter was remanded \u201cto resentence as to Count 5\u201d and it would not \u201creopen the whole sentencing hearing.\u201d The district court sentenced Defendants Ortiz and Rolon to 240 months\u2019 imprisonment on Count 5, to run concurrently with their concurrent 240-month and life sentences on their other counts, and left intact the rest of their original sentences. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-12\">II. MANDATE RULE AND LAW OF THE CASE DOCTRINE</p>\n<p id=\"b907-13\">In this second appeal, both Defendants raise challenges to their original sentences on counts other than Count 5. Specifically, the Defendants argue that their consecutive life sentences on Count 6 and their concurrent life sentences on Counts 1, 2, 8 and 9 constitute cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment and are' substantively unreasonable. Under the mandate rule, the district court properly limited the resentenc-ing to Count 5 and refused to reconsider the original sentences on Counts 1 through 4 and 6 through 9. <em>See United States v. Davis, </em>329 F.3d 1250, 1252 (11th Cir.2003) (\u201cIf the appellate court issues a limited mandate, ... the trial court is restricted in the range of issues it may consider on remand\u201d); <em>United States v. Tamayo, </em>80 F.3d 1514, 1520 (11th Cir.1996) (explaining that under the mandate rule, which is an application of the law of the case doctrine, a district court properly limits its resen-tencing to consideration of the remanded issue).</p>\n<p id=\"b907-15\">Not only are the Defendants\u2019 challenges to their life sentences on Counts 1, 2, 6, 8 and 9 barred by the mandate rule, they are also barred by general application of law of the case doctrine. In their first appeal, the Defendants challenged their life sentences as to these counts, including an Eighth Amendment claim as to Count 6, and this Court affirmed those sentences and explicitly rejected the Defendants\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>Eighth Amendment argument based on our precedent. <em>See Rolon I, </em>445 Fed. Appx. at 332. As such, under the law of the case, the Defendants may not raise the same or additional challenges to these life sentences in a subsequent appeal. <em>See United States v. Jordan, </em>429 F.3d 1032, 1035 (11th Cir.2005) (\u201cThe law of the case doctrine bars relitigation of issues that were decided, either explicitly or by necessary implication, in an earlier appeal of the same case.\u201d); <em>United States v. Escobar-Urrego, </em>110 F.3d 1556, 1560 (11th Cir. 1997) (explaining that the law of the case doctrine provides that \u201ca legal decision made at one stage of the litigation, unchallenged in a subsequent appeal when the opportunity existed, becomes the law of the case for future stages of the same litigation, and the parties are deemed to have waived the right to challenge that decision at a later time\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b908-4\">There is also no merit to the Defendants\u2019 argument that their Eighth Amendment challenge to their life sentences fall within the manifest injustice exception to the law of the case doctrine. <em>See Jordan, </em>429 F.3d at 1036 (addressing exception to law of the case doctrine \u201cwhere we are convinced our decision in the prior appeal is clearly erroneous and following it would work a manifest injustice\u201d). In <em>Rolon I, </em>we correctly concluded that precedent foreclosed the Defendants\u2019 Eighth Amendment challenge to their life sentences.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See United States v. Willis, </em>956 F.2d 248, 251 (11th Cir.1992) (rejecting Eighth Amendment challenge to mandatory life sentence under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) resulting from the defendant\u2019s prior convictions); <em>see also Harme-lin v. Michigan, </em>501 U.S. 957, 994, 111 S.Ct. 2680, 2701, 115 L.Ed.2d 836 (1991); <em>Rummel v. Estelle, </em>445 U.S. 263, 284-85, 100 S.Ct. 1133, 1144-45, 63 L.Ed.2d 382 (1980). To the extent the Defendants argue their new 240-month sentences on Count 5 are also cruel and unusual, this new Eighth Amendment claim similarly lacks merit in light of our precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-7\">III. SUBSTANTIVE REASONABLENESS</p>\n<p id=\"b908-8\">Defendant Rolon argues that his 240-month sentence on Count 5 is substantively unreasonable and that the district court should have granted his request for a downward variance based on Rolon\u2019s good institutional record as an inmate at USP Coleman.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-9\">We review the reasonableness of a sentence under a deferential abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). In reviewing for reasonableness, we first consider whether the district court committed any significant procedural error and then whether the sentence is substantively unreasonable under the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>the totality of the circumstances.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1190 (11th Cir.2008).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The abuse of discretion standard \u201callows a range of choice for the district court, so long as that choice does not constitute a clear error in judgment.\u201d <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1189 (11th Cir.2010) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 1813, 179 L.Ed.2d 772 (2011) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b909-7\">The weight to be given each \u00a7 3553(a) factor is within the district court\u2019s sound discretion, and we will not substitute our judgment for the district court\u2019s in weighing those factors. <em>United States v. Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d 823, 832 (11th Cir.2007). At resentencing, in addition to considering the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the district court may consider evidence of a defendant\u2019s post-sentencing rehabilitation and, where appropriate, may vary downward on that basis. <em>Pepper v. United States, </em>562 U.S. -, -, 131 S.Ct. 1229, 1241, 179 L.Ed.2d 196 (2011). The party challenging the sentence bears the burden of proving the sentence is unreasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b909-11\">Here, Defendant Rolon has not shown that his 240-month sentence on Count 5, run concurrent to his other 240-month sentences (on Counts 3 and 4) and his life sentences (on Counts 1, 2 and 9), was unreasonable. The district court rejected Rolon\u2019s request for a downward variance and concluded that a 240-month sentence on Count 5 was warranted \u201cbased on the seriousness of the offense and to promote respect for the law and to provide just punishment for the offense, and to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct and protect the public from further crimes of the defendant.\u201d The district court heard Rolon\u2019s mitigation argument that he had no prison disciplinary record and was paying his special assessment with earnings from his work in prison. The district court stated, however, that it did not think Rolon\u2019s post-sentencing rehabilitation \u201cwould outweigh the other factors that [it] had reviewed in the sentencing hearing last time.\u201d Rolon has given us no reason to disturb the district court\u2019s judgment in weighing the factors. In light of Rolon\u2019s extensive criminal history and the seriousness of his offenses, we cannot say the district court imposed an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>unreasonable sentence on Count 5.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AFE\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b908-5\">. The mandate rule and the law of the case doctrine also bar: (1) Defendant Rolon\u2019s arguments that he was entitled to a downward departure pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 5K2.12 and 5K2.13 based on his documented history of mental-health issues and that his life sentences on Counts 1, 2, 6, and 9 exceeded the statutory maximum under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C) because his offenses did not involve actual drugs; and (2) Defendant Ortiz's argument that he lacks the required predicate offenses necessary to qualify as a career offender.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b908-11\">. Although in the first appeal, Defendant Ro-lon's brief raised the Eighth Amendment claim, we noted in <em>Rolon I </em>that the Defendants adopted all relevant portions of each other's briefs and where applicable, we considered each issue with respect to both defendants. <em>See Rolon I, </em>445 Fed.Appx. at 321 n. 16.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b909-10\">. Defendant Rolon does not argue that his sentence is procedurally unreasonable. He does, however, complain that he was not given the revised Presentence Investigation Report (\"PSI\u201d) until eight days before the resen-tencing hearing, in violation of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32(e) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3552(d). Any error in this regard was harmless given that: (1) the parties agreed that the resentencing was limited to sentencing on Count 5 with the correct statutory maximum, an issue to which Rolon did not object and about which witnesses could not testify; (2) the parties acknowledged that the revised PSI was identical to the original PSI, except for the corrected statutory maximum as to Count 5; and (3) Rolon argued for a sentence below the 240-month statutory maximum as to Count 5. <em>See United States v. Willis, </em>649 F.3d 1248, 1257-58 (11th Cir. 2011), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 2733, 183 L.Ed.2d 83 (2012).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b909-14\">. The \u00a7 3553(a) factors include: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (3) the need for deterrence; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) the need to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care; (6) the kinds of sentences available; (7) the Sentencing Guidelines range; (8) pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (9) the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities; and (10) the need to provide restitution to victims. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b910-16\">. The Defendants' motion to stay their appeal pending the Supreme Court's ruling in <em>Alleyne v. United States, </em>No. 11-9335, is denied. The Defendants were not subject to an enhanced mandatory minimum sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(ii) or (iii) for brandishing or discharging a firearm and have never raised the issue presented in <em>Alleyne </em>in either the district court or this Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
