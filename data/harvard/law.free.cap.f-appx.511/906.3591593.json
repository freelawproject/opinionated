The plaintiffs\u2019 disclosure claim alleged that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties by not disclosing to the plan participants material, negative, nonpublic financial information about the sponsor\u2019s business and risks associated with investing in the bank. The plaintiffs\u2019 prudence claim alleged that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties under ERISA by continuing to invest in the sponsor\u2019s securities when it was imprudent to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-4\">Upon motion from the defendants, the district court dismissed the prudence claim on the grounds that it was a veiled diversification claim and barred by 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1104(a)(2). The district court denied the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss as to the disclosure claim, finding that the plaintiffs had sufficiently alleged an obligation of the plan administrators to disclose nonpublic, negative, material information to the plan participants.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-5\">The district court certified two questions for interlocutory review under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b). The first question, which relates to the disclosure claim, is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b930-6\">Does ERISA impose upon fiduciaries of an Eligible Individual Account Plan that offers the plan sponsor\u2019s publicly traded stock as an investment option a duty to disclose material, nonpublic financial information about the plan sponsor beyond the specific disclosures mandated by ERISA and its implementing regulations?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b930-7\">The second certified question relates to the prudence claim and asks:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b930-8\">Does \u00a7 404(a)(2) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (\u201cERISA\u201d), which exempts individual account plans (\u201cEIAPs\u201d) that acquire and hold employer securities from ERISA\u2019s diversification requirement, exempt fiduciaries of EIAPs from exercising their overarching duty of prudence under \u00a7 404(a)(1) even when it is imprudent to acquire or hold employer securities in an EIAP?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b930-11\">This Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Lanfear v. Home Depot, Inc., </em>679 F.3d 1267 (11th Cir.2012), resolves the issues in this case. <em>Home Depot </em>answers the disclosure claim question in the negative, finding that ERISA does not impose a duty to provide plan participants with nonpublic information affecting the value of the company\u2019s stock. <em>Id. </em>at 1284. <em>Home Depot </em>also answers the prudence claim question in the negative, finding that such a prudence claim was not a veiled diversification claim, and thus does not fall within the \u00a7 404(a)(2) exemption. <em>Id. </em>at 1276-77.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-12\">Defendants argue that alternative grounds exist that would justify a dismissal of the complaint. However, these issues were not dealt with by the district court. Under these circumstances, we feel it best to remand this matter to the district court so that it may proceed in the regular course.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-13\">We answer both certified questions in the negative, reverse the district court\u2019s order granting in part and denying in part the defendants motion to dismiss, and remand to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion and the <em>Home Depot </em>decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-14\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b930-9\">. The plan in question qualifies as both an Eligible Individual Account Plan and an Employee Stock Ownership Plan under ERISA.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
