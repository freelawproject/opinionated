Urias appeals his conviction. Ramos appeals his sentence of 42 months of imprisonment. We affirm both judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-15\">We reject Urias\u2019s claim that the district court abused its discretion when it excluded the opinion testimony of Dr. Tony Payan, testimony that Urias maintained would support his defense that kidnappers had forced him to carry the drugs across the border. <em>See General Electric Co. v. Joiner, </em>522 U.S. 136, 142, 118 S.Ct. 512, 139 L.Ed.2d 508 (1997); <em>Watkins v. Telsmith, Inc., </em>121 F.3d 984, 988 (5th Cir. 1997). Before an expert is permitted to offer opinion testimony, \u201cthe trial judge must determine whether the ... testimony is both rehable and relevant.\u201d <em>Burleson v. Tex. Dep\u2019t of Criminal Justice, </em>393 F.3d 577, 584 (5th Cir.2004). Because Urias fails to show that Payan\u2019s testimony was relevant, we do not reach the question whether Payan\u2019s testimony was rehable. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>523 F.3d 519, 525 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Ho, </em>311 F.3d 589, 602 n. 12 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-16\">Both Urias and Ramos testified that they at no time had any opportunity to escape from the men they say kidnapped them. Thus, Urias and Ramos could not have sought Mexican police assistance to overcome any duress, and so it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>does not matter that \u2014 as Payan would have opined \u2014 a pervasive distrust of the police might have made Urias afraid to seek police help. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 401; <em>United States v. Posada-Rios, </em>158 F.3d 832, 873 (5th Cir.1998). Additionally, Pay-an\u2019s opinion concerning the incidence of coerced drug activity originating in Mexico would not help to establish that it was more probable than not that Urias had acted under duress. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 401; <em>Burleson, </em>393 F.3d at 587. Payan testified in his <em>Daubert </em>hearing that most people who carry others\u2019 drugs across the border are compensated for doing so rather than coerced to do so. Also, Urias now concedes that his jurors were likely well aware of the violence in Mexico; thus, Payan\u2019s knowledge of this topic was not specialized to assist resolution of this case by a jury. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 702.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">We reject also Ramos\u2019s claim that the district court plainly erred when it failed to assign a minor role adjustment to Ramos\u2019s offense level. Ramos must first show on plain error review a forfeited error it is clear or obvious. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If he does, and if he shows also that the error affected his substantial rights, we have the discretion \u201cto remedy the error ... if the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks, bracketing, and citation omitted). \u201c[B]ecause he cannot demonstrate any error at all,\u201d however, Ramos cannot prevail on plain error review. <em>United States v. Teuschler, </em>689 F.3d 397, 400 (5th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">A defendant\u2019s role in the offense turns on culpability, not on status as a courier. <em>United States v. Buenrostro, </em>868 F.2d 135, 138 (5th Cir.1989). To show that he is entitled to more lenient treatment, Ramos must point to evidence that he was among the least culpable in the offense. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2 comment, (n.2); <em>United States v. Brown, </em>54 F.3d 234, 241 (5th Cir.1995). Ramos offered no evidence that he was less culpable than the others in his group who, like him, carried drugs over the border in backpacks. Additionally, there is no merit to the suggestion that Ramos was penalized for going to trial. The sentencing transcript makes clear that the district court\u2019s comment about Ramos\u2019s going to trial was not about the choice to go to trial but merely about the fact of having done so \u2014 the court was simply refreshing its recollection of the facts of Ramos\u2019s case, not expressing any vindictive sentiment.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b339-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
