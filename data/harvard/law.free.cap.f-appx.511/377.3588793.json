Thurby filed this 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action against various Texas officials, his attorneys, and several employees of the Big Spring State Hospital. The district court denied Thurby\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel to represent him in this action in the district court. Thurby is seeking IFP status to appeal the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-12\">\u201cThis Court must examine the basis of its jurisdiction, on its own motion, if necessary.\u201d <em>Mosley v. Cozby, </em>813 F.2d 659, 660 (5th Cir.1987). A timely \u201cnotice of appeal in a civil case is a jurisdictional requirement.\u201d <em>Bowles v. Russell, </em>551 U.S. 205, 214, 127 S.Ct. 2360, 168 L.Ed.2d 96 (2007). \u201cA document filed in the period prescribed by Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1) for taking an appeal should be construed as a notice of appeal if the document clearly evinces the party\u2019s intent to appeal.\u201d <em>Mosley, </em>813 F.2d at 660 (internal quotations marks and citations omitted); <em>see also Smith v. Barry, </em>502 U.S. 244, 248, 112 S.Ct. 678, 116 L.Ed.2d 678 (1992) (\u201cnotice of appeal must specifically indicate the litigant\u2019s intent to seek appellate review\u201d). A pleading that seeks reconsideration of an order of the district court is not effective as a notice of appeal, even if labeled a notice of appeal. <em>Mosley, </em>813 F.2d at 660. FedeRAL Rule of Appellate Procedure 3(c)(1) requires that the notice of appeal identify the party taking the appeal, the judgment being appealed, and the court to which the appeal is taken. Fed. R.App. P. 3(c)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-17\">Although the pleading docketed as Thurby\u2019s notice of appeal was labeled \u201cappealing,\u201d nothing else in that pleading evinces an intent to appeal the district court\u2019s order to the appellate court. Thur-by\u2019s prayer for relief asked the district court to \u201creconsider\u201d his motion for appointment of counsel. All of Thurby\u2019s arguments were directed to the district court. He did not state that he was seeking an appeal to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. A motion for reconsideration that seeks an appeal alternatively to reconsideration does not clearly indicate the intent to appeal. <em>See Mosley, </em>813 F.2d at 660. The pleading did not clearly evince Thurby\u2019s intent to appeal because Thurby sought reconsideration of his motion for appointment of counsel by the district court. Because the primary relief sought was reconsideration by the district court, with only a single reference to \u201cappealing,\u201d and with no indication that an appeal was sought in the Fifth Circuit, the pleading was insufficient to constitute a notice of appeal. <em>See Mosley, </em>813 F.2d at 660.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-18\">We note that the district court\u2019s judgment denying relief is not final, as Thur-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>by\u2019s motion for reconsideration is still pending. Once the district court does rule, Thurby may file a notice of appeal at that time if he is dissatisfied with the ruling. <em>Mosley, </em>818 F.2d at 660.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">We lack jurisdiction over this appeal. APPEAL DISMISSED; ALL OUTSTANDING MOTIONS ARE DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b400-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
