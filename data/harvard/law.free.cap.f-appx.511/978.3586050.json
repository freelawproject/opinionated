Manzini contends that the district court erred in concluding that Moore was entitled to qualified immunity. He also contends that the court erred by dismissing his amended complaint prematurely and not allowing him leave to further amend that complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-15\">Manzini became the subject of disciplinary proceedings by the Florida Bar in 2009 and 2010 when four separate grievances were filed against him. One of those grievances was evidently filed by The Courts at Doral Isles Condominium Association (\u201cthe Condominium Association\u201d), one of Manzini\u2019s clients. On March 12, 2010, without Manzini\u2019s knowledge, Moore sent the following e-mail to the Condominium Association:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1001-16\">I will go into details of the situation with you as soon as I am at liberty to do so. Suffice it to say, regardless of whether you had withdrawn your complaint, Mr. Manzini\u2019s position vis-\u00e1-vis the Florida Bar would have remained the same.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1001-17\">On March 15 Manzini consented to his own disbarment, and on March 18 Moore sent another e-mail to the Condominium Association without Manzini\u2019s knowledge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1001-18\">Hello. I can report to you that Mr. Manzini has tendered his consent to be disbarred from the Florida Bar based on his admitted failure to preserve client funds in trust and his failure to apply those funds to the purpose for which they were entrusted to him. Subject to approval of the Florida Board of Governors, the disbarment will be submitted to the Florida Supreme Court for their ultimate order of disbarment. I am attaching a client security fund claim form (and explanatory information) which you and your organization may submit to attempt to recover funds which may have been misappropriated. I will keep you informed as to the final disposition of this matter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1001-19\">On March 23 the Florida Bar\u2019s Board of Governors accepted Manzini\u2019s disbarment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"980\">*980</page-number>On March 26, eight days after Moore\u2019s last e-mail, the Condominium Association sued Manzini and his law firm in state court. That same day, the judge assigned to hear that case issued an <em>ex parte </em>injunction freezing all of Manzini\u2019s assets including his personal, operating, and trust bank accounts. That injunction was lifted on April 9, two weeks after it was entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-4\">Manzini then sued the Florida Bar and Moore under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988, alleging that they had violated his civil rights while acting under color of state law. He also filed a motion to proceed <em>informa pauper-is, </em>which the district court granted. After the Bar and Moore filed a motion to dismiss, Manzini amended his complaint to allege three separate counts. Only Count 1 is at issue in this appeal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In that count, Manzini alleged that Moore\u2019s second e-mail to the Condominium Association amounted to common law libel because he had never admitted that he failed to preserve client funds in trust or failed to apply those funds to the purpose for which they were entrusted to him. Manzini further alleged that because of Moore\u2019s e-mail, the Condominium Association had sued him in state court, which led to the state court\u2019s order freezing all of his bank accounts without any notice to him, which effectively put his law firm out of business during a time when he had an obligation to wind up his affairs. Therefore, Manzini alleged, he was deprived of constitutional rights, although he did not specify which ones.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-5\">Moore filed a motion to dismiss Manzi-ni\u2019s amended complaint on the grounds that Manzini failed to state a federal cause of action sufficient to vest the court with subject matter jurisdiction and that Manzi-ni\u2019s claims were barred by absolute immunity under the Eleventh Amendment. Moore also asserted the defense of qualified immunity for the first time in her reply to Manzini\u2019s opposition to the motion to dismiss. Manzini moved to strike the part of Moore\u2019s reply memorandum that asserted qualified immunity, arguing that she could not raise that defense for the first time in reply. Moore then filed a motion to stay all discovery in the case until the court ruled on the motion to dismiss, and the court granted that motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-8\">The district court referred the case to a magistrate judge, who recommended that Moore\u2019s motion to dismiss be granted. The magistrate judge concluded that Man-zini\u2019s claims against Moore in her official capacity were barred by absolute immunity under the Eleventh Amendment, and that in her individual capacity Moore was entitled to qualified immunity as to Count 1 because she was acting within her discretionary authority, and because Manzini failed to show how any of Moore\u2019s actions violated his constitutional rights. The magistrate judge also recommended denying Manzini\u2019s motion to strike, reasoning that the court could properly consider the qualified immunity issue <em>sua sponte </em>under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2), which governs proceedings <em>in forma pauperis, </em>notwithstanding Moore\u2019s failure to raise that defense in her motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-9\">Manzini objected to the report and recommendation, arguing that the district court could not dismiss his complaint <em>sua sponte, </em>that the magistrate judge should have granted him leave to amend his complaint, and that Moore\u2019s communications with the Condominium Association were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"981\">*981</page-number>not within her discretionary authority. Manzini further argued that the magistrate judge erred in finding that he had not identified any of Moore\u2019s actions that had amounted to a deprivation of his constitutional rights. Specifically, he argued that Moore\u2019s e-mails to his former client violated his property interests under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-4\">The district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation and dismissed Manzini\u2019s amended complaint. The court reasoned that it had the responsibility under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2) to dismiss <em>sua sponte </em>any <em>in forma pau-peris </em>claims seeking monetary relief against a defendant immune from such relief. It also agreed that Moore was entitled to qualified immunity, and that Manzi-ni had not shown good cause as to why he should have been given a second opportunity to amend his complaint. This is Man-zini\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-6\">Manzini contends that the district court erred in dismissing his complaint on the grounds that Moore was entitled to qualified immunity. \u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s decision to grant or deny the defense of qualified immunity on a motion to dismiss, accepting the factual allegations in the complaint as true and drawing all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff\u2019s favor.\u201d <em>Dalrymple v. Reno, </em>334 F.3d 991, 994 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-8\">The doctrine of qualified immunity provides \u201ccomplete protection for government officials sued in their individual capacities as long as their conduct violates no clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\u201d <em>Lee v. Ferraro, </em>284 F.3d 1188, 1193-94 (11th Cir.2002) (quotation marks omitted). \u201cThe immunity protects all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law.\u201d <em>Jordan v. Mosley, </em>487 F.3d 1350, 1354 (11th Cir. 2007) (quotation marks omitted). A public official asserting qualified immunity \u201cmust first prove that [she] was acting within the scope of [her] discretionary authority when the allegedly wrongful acts occurred.\u201d <em>Lee, </em>284 F.3d at 1194. In determining whether a public official was acting within her discretionary authority, we ask: (1) whether the official was performing a function that, <em>\u201cbut for </em>the alleged constitutional infirmity,\u201d would have fallen within her \u201clegitimate job description,\u201d and (2) whether that function was carried out \u201cthrough means that were within [her] power to utilize.\u201d <em>Holloman ex rel. Holloman v. Harland, </em>370 F.3d 1252, 1265-66 (11th Cir. 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-10\">Manzini argues that Moore\u2019s second email to the Condominium Association was not within her discretionary authority because no disciplinary proceedings were pending against him at the time of the email. We disagree. As counsel for the Florida Bar, Moore\u2019s duties included communicating case developments to complaining parties. <em>Cf, </em>Rules Regulating the Florida Bar 3-7.4(f) (requiring bar counsel to assist grievance committee at its request by notifying complainants and respondents of committee actions); Rule 3-7.4(j)(2) (requiring bar counsel to notify complainant and respondent when the grievance committee finds no probable cause); Rule 3-7.4(k) (requiring bar counsel to submit a letter report to complainant and respondent when the grievance finds no probable cause); Rule 3-7.5(d) (requiring bar counsel to notify complainant and respondent of actions by the Board of Governors). Manzini has not cited any authority, nor have we found any, to suggest that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"982\">*982</page-number>bar counsel\u2019s duty to communicate is limited to the time when a formal disciplinary proceeding is pending. Because the Condominium Association had filed a complaint against Manzini, Moore\u2019s communications with it fell within her \u201clegitimate job description,\u201d and those communications about case developments were carried out \u201cthrough means that were within [her] power to utilize.\u201d <em>See Holloman, </em>370 F.3d at 1265-66.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-4\">Because Moore established that she was acting within her discretionary authority, the burden shifts to Manzini to show that: (1)the facts alleged demonstrate that Moore\u2019s conduct violated a constitutional right; and (2) at the time of the violation, the constitutional right was clearly established. <em>Lee, </em>284 F.3d at 1194. Manzini argues that Moore\u2019s emails caused his client to sue him in state court, which then caused the state court to freeze his bank accounts, which amounted to a deprivation of his property and liberty interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-6\">The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment provides that no state shall \u201cdeprive any person of. life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. XIV, \u00a7 1. A violation of either procedural or substantive due process protections may form the basis for a suit under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. <em>McKinney v. Pate, </em>20 F.3d 1550, 1555 (11th Cir.1994) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-7\">To state a claim for a procedural due process violation, Manzini must allege (1) \u201ca deprivation of a constitutionally-protected liberty or property interest,\u201d (2) \u201cstate action,\u201d and (3) \u201cconstitutionally inadequate process.\u201d <em>Cryder v. Oxendine, </em>24 F.3d 175, 177 (11th Cir.1994). Manzini must also establish an \u201caffirmative causal connection between [Moore\u2019s] acts or omissions and the alleged constitutional deprivation.\u201d <em>Troupe v. Sarasota Cnty., Fla., </em>419 F.3d 1160, 1165 (11th Cir.2005). The alleged constitutional deprivation in this case is the freezing of Manzini\u2019s bank accounts for two weeks. Manzini argues that Moore caused that deprivation because her emails amounted to the tort of defamation and caused his client to sue him in state court, which caused the state court to freeze his bank accounts, which caused a deprivation of his property and liberty interests. But even assuming that Moore\u2019s email \u201ccaused\u201d the Condominium Association to sue Manzini in state court, the decision to freeze his bank accounts was made by a state court judge after independently reviewing all the evidence submitted by the Condominium Association in that case. The decision of that state court judge breaks the chain of causation between Moore\u2019s actions and any alleged constitutional violations. <em>Cf. Whiting v. Traylor, </em>85 F.3d 581, 586 n. 10 (11th Cir.1996) (noting that in \u00a7 1983 malicious prosecution actions, the arresting officers will often \u201cnot be responsible for the continuation of the prosecution because the prosecutor (or some other factor) will break the causal link between [the arresting officer\u2019s] conduct and plaintiffs injury\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-11\">To state a claim for a substantive due process violation, a person must show that their fundamental rights\u2014those \u201cimplicit in the concept of ordered liberty\u201d\u2014 have been infringed. <em>McKinney, </em>20 F.3d at 1556. Whatever right Manzini may have to not having a state court enter an order freezing his bank accounts for two weeks, that right is certainly not a fundamental one. He has therefore failed to state a substantive due process claim.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1005-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"983\">*983</page-number>B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-5\">Manzini also contends that the dismissal of his amended complaint on qualified immunity grounds was premature because he did not have a \u201cmeaningful opportunity\u201d to respond to Moore\u2019s defense of qualified immunity, which she raised in a reply memo in support of her motion to dismiss. We disagree. In her report and recommendation, the magistrate judge reasoned that the district court could reach the issue of qualified immunity even though Moore raised that issue for the first time in a reply memorandum. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2) (mandating that the Court <em>sua sponte </em>dismiss <em>in forma pauperis </em>claims for monetary relief that are brought against a defendant who is immune from such relief). Manzini had the opportunity to respond to Moore\u2019s argument by objecting to that report and recommendation, and he did so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-6\">Manzini further contends that the dismissal of his amended complaint on qualified immunity grounds was premature because discovery had been stayed by the district court shortly after Moore filed her reply asserting the defense of qualified immunity. As we have already discussed, Manzini cannot show a constitutional violation because the independent action of the state court judge broke the chain of causation between Moore\u2019s email and any alleged procedural due process violation, and because Moore did not violate any fundamental right. No amount of discovery could change that. Manzini also argues that because \u201cqualified immunity is an affirmative defense,\u201d that issue should have been decided at the summary judgment stage and not on a motion to dismiss, but he is wrong. <em>See, e.g., Nolen v. Jackson, </em>102 F.3d 1187, 1191 (11th Cir.1997) (reversing the district court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss on grounds of qualified immunity).</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-8\">Finally, Manzini contends that the district court should have permitted him to further amend his complaint. Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a), a court should \u201cfreely give leave [to amend] when justice so requires.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a)(2). However, a district court need not allow an amendment \u201cwhere amendment would be futile.\u201d <em>Corsello v. Lineare, Inc., </em>428 F.3d 1008, 1014 (11th Cir.2005). The problem with Manzini\u2019s amended complaint was that it failed to show how Moore\u2019s e-mail violated his constitutional rights. And there was no way for Manzini to further amend his complaint to avoid that problem or the resulting conclusion that Moore is entitled to qualified immunity. He cannot make out a claim for a procedural due process violation because the chain of causation between Moore\u2019s action and any alleged deprivation of property was cut off by the independent actions of a state court. He also cannot make out a claim for a substantive due process violation because Moore\u2019s e-mail did not violate any fundamental right.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1001-11\">. The Supreme Court of Florida approved Manzini\u2019s disbarment on April 1, 2010 and gave him 30 days to wind up his practice and notify his clients in order to protect their interests.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1002-6\">. Manzini did not appeal the district court\u2019s dismissal of Count 2, alleging that Moore violated his Sixth Amendment rights by providing information about his disbarment to a judge in a civil case. Appellant's Br. at 7. Manzini also conceded in his brief that he abandoned Count 3 of his amended complaint, as well as all of his claims against the Florida Bar, in the district court. Appellant's Br. at 7.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1004-8\">.
