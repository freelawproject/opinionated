Athough we typically review sentences for reasonableness following the bifurcated process set forth in <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007), Mata concedes that plain error applies because he failed to raise his current arguments in the district court. <em>See United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391-92 (5th Cir.2007). To show plain error, the appellant must show a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and that affects his substantial rights. <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If the appellant makes such a showing, this court has the discretion to correct the error but only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id. </em>\u201cTo show that an error affects a defendant\u2019s substantial rights, the defendant must show that it affected the outcome in the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 364 (5th Cir. 2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-21\">We need not decide whether the district court improperly referenced information adduced during Mata\u2019s wiretap hearing because Mata\u2019s U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(a) enhancement as an organizer, the validity of which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>he does not challenge, precluded him from receiving a safety valve adjustment such that the district court could not have sentenced him to less than the 120-month statutory minimum sentences that he received on his convictions for conspiring to import and possess with intent to distribute cocaine. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 501.2(a)(4); 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 960(b)(1)(B) and 841(b)(l)(A)(ii). Indeed, his argument that the alleged error affected any of his sentences is entirely conclusory; he fails to show that his substantial rights were violated. <em>See Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d at 364.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">Mata also contends that the district court failed to consider the sentencing factors of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), as mandated by the Supreme Court in <em>Gall. </em>He cannot show an effect on his substantial rights because the district court imposed the lowest possible sentence based on the statutory minimum sentence. <em>See United States v. Doggins, </em>633 F.3d 379, 384 (5th Cir. 2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b406-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
