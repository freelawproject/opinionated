Dorsey sued Bailey to recover for injuries that Dorsey suffered during a fight with his cellmate, Jerome Terry, whom Dorsey had requested that Bailey relocate to another prison cell. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-9\">The district court did not err when it entered summary judgment in favor of Bailey. Dorsey failed to establish that Bailey was subjectively aware that Dorsey faced a substantial risk of serious physical harm from Terry. <em>See Carter v. Galloway, </em>352 F.3d 1346, 1349 (11th Cir.2003). Bailey\u2019s affidavit established that, despite an earlier \u201cdisagreement\u201d between the prisoners, he did not believe Terry posed any risk of harm to Dorsey because the inmate-control system officer who assigned Terry to Dorsey\u2019s cell had determined that the two men were not \u201cvalidated enemfies].\u201d And the inmates had lived peaceably since their disagreement. Dorsey averred that he and Terry had resided in the same cell block \u201cfor months without incident\u201d and they visited Bailey together to report the \u201cpotential danger\u201d in housing them together. Although Dorsey reported that he did not \u201cfeel comfortable\u201d living with Terry, Dorsey did not state that he had been threatened by or feared Terry. Dorsey also agreed to \u201ctry to chill\u201d after Bailey said that he would address the housing situation in a couple of days. Affidavits prepared by other inmates established that Bailey knew Terry had been a \u201ctroublemaker,\u201d had \u201cpast conflicts\u201d with Dorsey, and had been removed from the cell block the previous week for sexual misconduct, but failed to prove that Bailey could have known that Terry would hurt Dorsey. Bailey \u201carguably should have ... [separated Dorsey and Terry,] but [a] \u2018merely negligent failure to protect an inmate from attack does not justify liability under section <em>1983....\u2019\u201dId. </em>at 1350 (quoting <em>Brown v. Hughes, </em>894 F.2d 1533, 1537 (11th Cir.1990)).</p>\n<p id=\"b972-11\">We AFFIRM the summary judgment in favor of Bailey.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
