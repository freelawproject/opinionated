By moving to proceed IFP, Edmonds is challenging the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">He briefs no argument challenging the district court\u2019s conclusion that, inasmuch as his Rule 60 motion sought to invalidate this court\u2019s November 2005 denial of COA, it lacked jurisdiction. Edmonds has therefore waived the argument. <em>See Hughes v. Johnson, </em>191 F.3d 607, 613 (5th Cir.1999). Although Edmonds challenges the alternative construction of his Rule 60 motion as a successive \u00a7 2255 motion, to the extent that he sought to challenge the district court\u2019s previous denial of his speedy-trial claim on the merits, the district court\u2019s construction of the motion as successive was correct, and its alternative dismissal for lack of jurisdiction because such motion was unauthorized was proper. See <em>Gonzalez v. Crosby, </em>545 U.S. 524, 532, 125 S.Ct. 2641, 162 L.Ed.2d 480 (2005); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(h); <em>see also United States v. Key, </em>205 F.3d 773, 774 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">Whether the district court failed to provide Edmonds with a copy of the magistrate judge\u2019s report and the opportunity to respond need not be resolved. Edmonds has not identified any factual dispute or legal contention that he could have raised in the district court that would have prevented dismissal, so any error was harmless. <em>See Braxton v. Estelle, </em>641 F.2d 392, 396 (5th Cir. 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-9\">Edmonds identifies no nonfrivolous issue for appeal. A COA is DENIED. <em>See Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000). The motion for leave to appeal IFP is DENIED, and the appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 &amp; n. 24; <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b377-38\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
