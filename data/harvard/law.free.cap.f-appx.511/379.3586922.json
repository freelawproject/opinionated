In his complaint, Hayward alleged violations of his civil rights relating to the medical care he received and retaliation by staff while he was housed in the Forcht Wade Correctional Center. The district court determined that Hayward failed to exhaust his administrative remedies, denied Hayward\u2019s motion for summary judgment, granted the defendants\u2019 cross-motion for summary judgment, and dismissed Hayward\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">We review the grant of a motion for summary judgment de novo. <em>Dillon v. Rogers, </em>596 F.3d 260, 266 (5th Cir.2010). However, Hayward\u2019s arguments regarding the sole issue on appeal, the administrative exhaustion of his claims, are minimal and entirely conclusory, without any citation to the record or any law. Although we apply less stringent standards to parties proceeding pro se than to counsel-represented parties and liberally construe briefs of pro se litigants, pro se parties must still brief the issues. <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 225 (5th Cir.1993). The appellant\u2019s brief must contain an argument, which in turn must contain his \u201ccontentions and the reasons for them, with citations to the authorities and parts of the record on which the appellant relies.\u201d Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9); <em>see Yohey, </em>985 F.2d at 225. Because Hayward has not briefed an argument as to the district court\u2019s reason for dismissing his complaint, he has abandoned the issue on appeal. See <em>Geiger v. Jowers, </em>404 F.3d 371, 373 n. 6 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-13\">Hayward has similarly abandoned a challenge, by failing to brief the issue, to the district court\u2019s decision to strike his motion to amend his complaint to add new claims against new defendants at Dixon Correctional Center. <em>See Geiger, </em>404 F.3d at 373 n. 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-14\">To the extent that the defendants assert that Dennis Richardson is not a proper party to this appeal, although he moved, with the other defendants through the same counsel, for summary judgment, the assertion is without merit. <em>See </em>Fed. R. Civ. PROC. 5(b)(1), La.Rev.Stat. ANN. \u00a7 13:5108.1 (2008); <em>Ellibee v. Leonard, </em>226 Fed.Appx. 351, 357-58 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-15\">The judgment of the district court granting summary judgment to all of the defendants and dismissing Hayward\u2019s complaint is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b402-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
