We granted a certificate of appealability (COA) on the following issue: \u201c[Wjhether Hibbert\u2019s trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to a breach of the plea agreement.\u201d After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-9\">The facts relevant to the COA are summarized below. In 2009, Hibbert pleaded guilty to the above counts. At the time of his plea, he faced a pending state charge for possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, which arose out of the same conduct as the federal charges to which he was pleading guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-10\">Hibbert\u2019s plea agreement provided that it was \u201climited to the Office of the United States Attorney for the Middle District of Florida and cannot bind other federal, state or local prosecuting authorities.... \u201d It also stated that \u201cno other promises, agreements, or representations [had] been made to the defendant or the defendant\u2019s attorney with regard to [the] guilty plea.\u201d Nothing in the agreement suggested that the federal prosecutor would arrange for the dismissal of the state charge. Hibbert initialed every page of the agreement and signed it.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-12\">At the change of plea hearing, Hibbert verbally confirmed that the written plea agreement reflected \u201cevery promise and representation\u201d on which he relied in deciding whether to plead guilty, and that he was not relying on anything outside of the written document in deciding to plead guilty. Hibbert also inquired about his pending state charge, and the prosecutor stated he would send a letter to the state prosecutor requesting dismissal of the charge. Hibbert then confirmed that he understood that there was no guarantee the state charge would be dismissed. The district court accepted Hibbert\u2019s change of plea and eventually sentenced him to 180 months\u2019 imprisonment. Hibbert did not appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-13\">After sentencing, Hibbert pleaded guilty to the state charge and subsequently filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate his federal sentence, arguing that his counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the government\u2019s breach of its promise to contact the state prosecutor about the related state charge. The district court denied the motion and this is Hibbert\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-14\">In reviewing a denial of a \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate, we review the district court\u2019s legal conclusions <em>de novo </em>and its fact findings for clear error. <em>Lynn v. United States, </em>365 F.3d 1225, 1232 (11th Cir.2004). Our review is \u201climited to the issues specified in the COA.\u201d <em>Murray v. United States, </em>145 F.3d 1249, 1251 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b861-15\">To demonstrate ineffective assistance of counsel, Hibbert must show that: (1) his counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and (2) \u201cthe deficient performance prejudiced the defense.\u201d <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). To demonstrate prejudice in the context of a guilty plea, a petitioner \u201cmust show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial.\u201d <em>Figuereo-Sanchez v. United States, </em>678 F.3d 1203, 1209 (11th Cir.2012) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b862-4\">Hibbert argues that, at the time he decided to plead guilty, he expected the federal prosecutor to contact state authorities to recommend the dismissal of the related state charge. He contends that the federal prosecutor never did so and that his attorney\u2019s failure to object to this alleged breach of the plea agreement constituted ineffective assistance of counsel. But Hib-bert cannot demonstrate that, but for his attorney\u2019s failure to object, he would have decided to go to trial. His written plea agreement mentioned no promises with respect to the state charge, and Hibbert stated that his decision to plead guilty was based solely on that written agreement. Because the promise to contact state authorities did not inform his decision to plead guilty, his ineffective assistance of counsel claim fails. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the district court\u2019s denial of Hibbert\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion is</p>\n<p id=\"b862-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
