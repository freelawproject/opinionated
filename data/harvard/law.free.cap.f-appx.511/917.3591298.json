Oneal\u2019s 120-month sentence imposed after Oneal pled guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g) and 924(e). On appeal, the government argues that the district court erred by imposing a sentence below the fifteen-year (180-month) statutory mandatory minimum sentence required by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) given Oneal\u2019s status as an armed career criminal. After review, we vacate and remand for resentencing consistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b939-22\">Under the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d), a defendant is subject to a mandatory minimum fifteen-year sentence if he is convicted of violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) and he has three previous convictions for a violent felony or serious drug offense. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1). A district court is not authorized to sentence a defendant below the statutory mandatory minimum unless the government has filed a substantial assistance motion pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e) and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 or the defendant qualifies for safety-valve relief pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f). <em>United States v. Castaing-Sosa, </em>530 F.3d 1358, 1360 (11th Cir.2008). Although after <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220,125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the district court applies the Sentencing Guidelines in an advisory fashion, the district court remains bound by statutes designating mandatory minimum sentences. <em>Id. </em>at 1362; <em>see also United States v. CiszKowski, </em>492 F.3d 1264, 1270 (11th Cir.2007) (\u201cEven after <em>Booker, </em>the district court is bound by the statutory mandatory m\u00ednimums.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b940-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"918\">*918</page-number>Here, the district court found, and the parties do not dispute, that Defendant Oneal\u2019s prior two burglary convictions and two aggravated assault convictions qualified as predicate offenses for purposes of the ACCA. Thus, Defendant Oneal was subject to the ACCA\u2019s fifteen-year mandatory minimum sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-4\">Further, the parties do not dispute that Defendant Oneal was ineligible for safety-valve relief and that the government did not file a substantial assistance motion. In these circumstances and under our precedent, as Defendant Oneal concedes, the district court was not authorized to impose a 120-month sentence, below the ACCA\u2019s fifteen-year mandatory minimum. <em>See Castaing-Sosa, </em>5B0 F.3d at 1360.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-5\">For these reasons and based on our precedent, we must vacate Defendant Oneal\u2019s 120-month sentence and remand to the district court with instructions to resentence Defendant Oneal in accordance with the ACCA\u2019s mandatory minimum fifteen-year sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-6\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b939-18\">. We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s authority to impose a sentence below the statutory mandatory minimum. <em>United States v. Gomes, </em>621 F.3d 1343, 1345 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
