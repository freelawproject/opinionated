Kerley's Rule 32, Ala. R. Crim. P., petition for postconviction relief on one of the claims in Kerley's petition. Kerley cross-appeals the circuit court's denial of the other two claims raised in his petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    Facts and Procedural History\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In 2014, Kerley was convicted of one count of first-degree sexual abuse of M.L. and one count of first-degree sexual abuse of J.H. See \u00a7 13A-6-66(a)(1), Ala. Code 1975. The trial court sentenced Kerley to five years' imprisonment for each conviction. This Court affirmed Kerley's convictions and sentences on direct appeal in an unpublished memorandum issued on April 10, 2015.\n   <em>\n    Kerley v.

Kerley was married to E.K., the mother of J.H. and M.L., and lived with E.K., J.H., and M.L. in Jefferson County. E.K. was a nurse and worked the night shift in a hospital on weekends. While E.K. worked, Kerley would keep M.L. and J.H. at home.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   \"M.L. testified that on her ninth birthday-January 2, 2002-the first incident of sexual abuse by Kerley occurred. M.L. and Kerley were lying on the sofa watching television together when Kerley began to 'rub ... his penis against [her] butt.' (R. 43.) M.L. indicated that they were both clothed and that Kerley told her that 'this is what dads and daughters did on their ninth birthday.' (R. 44.) E.K. was at work and Kerley and M.L. were alone in the house at the time this incident occurred.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   \"M.L. testified that, on multiple occasions, Kerley would enter her bedroom to read her a bedtime story. Inside the bedroom, Kerley would 'grind his penis on [M.L.'s] vagina area.' (R. 45.) At first, Kerley touched M.L. while she wore clothes but the abuse progressed to the point where M.L. was unclothed. Kerley told M.L. that it was 'really hot' in the room and told M.L. to undress, making 'it seem like it was part of the bedtime story.' (R. 45.) Kerley used his hands to touch M.L.'s breasts and vagina. Kerley also penetrated M.L.'s vagina with his fingers.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   \"M.L. testified that Kerley had his clothes on when these incidents first began; however, as the abuse progressed, Kerley would sometimes not wear any pants or underwear. Kerley would tell M.L. to hold his penis. M.L. testified that she did as Kerley asked because she did not know what else to do. M.L. indicated that these incidents continued until she was 12 years old. M.L. did not tell anyone about the abuse because Kerley threatened to kill M.L.'s family if she ever disclosed the abuse.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   \"J.H. was 8 years old and had her own bedroom down the hall from M.L. when Kerley began abusing J.H. J.H. testified that she would be asleep in her room and would be awakened by Kerley touching her breasts and vagina with his fingers; the touching occurred both over and underneath J.H.'s clothing. After Kerley touched J.H., he would tell her that she 'was loved.' (R. 86.) J.H. testified that Kerley would touch her a couple of times each month. These incidents ended when J.H. was either 12 or 13 years old and moved in with her father to escape Kerley's abuse. When J.H. moved, she wrote E.K. a letter and explained that she no longer wanted to live with E.K. anymore. J.H. did not tell anyone about the abuse because Kerley said that E.K. would be angry at her. M.L. and J.H. eventually confided the abuse to each other and the two contacted the police.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Although Kerley did not testify on his own behalf at trial, he called two witnesses in his defense, and, through their testimony as well as through cross-examination and argument, Kerley denied the sexual-abuse allegations, asserted that M.L. and J.H. had made up the allegations against him at the urging of their mother, who was fighting Kerley for custody of M.L.'s and J.H.'s\n   half sister at the time M.L. and J.H. had made the allegations against him in September 2010, and attacked M.L.'s and J.H.'s credibility, including presenting evidence impeaching portions of M.L.'s and J.H.'s testimony. For example, Kerley presented evidence indicating that the layout of the house that he shared with E.K., M.L., and J.H., was not as M.L. had testified; that he and M.L. were not alone in the house on her ninth birthday, as M.L. had testified; and that M.L. and J.H. had lived with their father for several months in the summer of 2003, contrary to their testimony that they had spent only two weeks with their father that year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On September 19, 2016, Kerley, through counsel, timely filed the instant Rule 32 petition.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   He filed an amendment on December 21, 2016, and a second amendment on March 24, 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In his petition and amendments, Kerley alleged that his trial counsel was ineffective for allegedly: (1) not requesting a unanimity instruction; (2) not calling his brother to testify and not eliciting testimony from his sister that M.L. had recanted her allegations of sexual abuse; and (3) not calling to testify Kerley's adult daughter to refute M.L.'s testimony that she was abused on her ninth birthday. On January 13, 2017, the State filed a response and a motion to dismiss Kerley's petition and first amendment, arguing that the claims raised therein-claims (1) and (2), as set out above-were insufficiently pleaded and meritless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On March 15, 2017, the circuit court conducted an evidentiary hearing on Kerley's petition. On March 29, 2017, the circuit court issued an order granting Kerley's Rule 32 petition and setting aside his convictions and sentences on the ground that his trial counsel had been ineffective for not requesting a unanimity instruction, claim (1), as set out above; the circuit court found that claims (2) and (3), as set out above, had no merit. On April 25, 2017, both the State and Kerley filed motions to reconsider the circuit court's judgment. The circuit court did not issue a ruling on either motion; therefore, both motions were denied by operation of law 30 days after the circuit court's March 29, 2017, order.

Specifically, the State argues that because Kerley did not call his trial counsel to testify at the evidentiary hearing he necessarily failed to prove that his counsel's decision not to request a unanimity instruction was deficient and was not the result of reasonable trial strategy.

Kerley also argues that he was prejudiced by counsel's failure to request a unanimity instruction because, he says, in a case involving both specific and generic evidence of sexual abuse it is impossible to know on which incidents-the specific or the generic-the jury's verdict was based.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   This Court has recognized that \"[i]t is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to prove a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel without questioning counsel about the specific claim, especially when the claim is based on specific actions, or inactions, of counsel that occurred outside the record.\"\n   <em>\n    Broadnax v.

Kerley's sister, who also testified at trial, testified at the hearing that on \"Easter Sunday of 2010,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   M.L. told her that Kerley \"never touched [her] and [J.H.] or abused [them] in any way\" and that their mother had \"told [them] to say that.\" (R. 9.)

He also testified that he spoke with Kerley's counsel about M.L.'s statements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Because Kerley did not raise the claim regarding his daughter until after the evidentiary hearing, Kerley did not call his daughter to testify at the hearing, although he did attach to his second amendment raising this claim an affidavit from his daughter in which she averred that she and her sister had spent all day and all night at Kerley's home on M.L.'s ninth birthday and that M.L. and J.H. were \"never left unattended.\" (C. 114.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   As noted previously in this opinion, Kerley did not call his trial counsel to testify at the Rule 32 hearing, and his failure to do so is fatal to these particular claims of ineffective assistance of counsel.
