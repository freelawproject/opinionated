The jury convicted Defendant of the two charged offenses. Defendant was not sentenced on those two convictions. Instead, Defendant was later adjudicated as a fourth felony habitual offender and sentenced on the multiple offender adjudication pursuant to La.R.S. 15:529.1 to thirty-two years at hard labor, without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence on each count to run concurrently.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendant now appeals his convictions and sentences, raising three assignments of error. The State also appeals the sentences imposed. For the following reasons, we affirm the Defendant's convictions. We note as an error patent that Defendant had not been sentenced on the original convictions prior to the imposition of the \"Enhanced Sentence\" under the Habitual Offender Law. We further find that Defendant had not waived the mandatory twenty-four hour sentencing delay required by La.Code Crim.P. art. 873 before being adjudicated as a habitual offender subject to enhanced sentencing. We vacate Defendant's habitual offender adjudication and sentences and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this decision and the law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   According to testimony presented at trial, at about 3:30 a.m. on June 6, 2016, Sgt. Joshua Stanford, a patrol sargent, was in uniform and on duty with the Deridder Police Department when he heard a car alarm in the HUD housing area about one block from his location. He then headed toward the sounding car alarm in his properly marked patrol unit. Officer Stanford testified that he immediately saw the lights of a vehicle flashing and, as the car alarm continued to go off, he observed a person, later identified as Defendant, standing next to the driver's door of the vehicle with a paper bag and miscellaneous items in his hand, including what was identified as a twenty (20) ounce beer can. As the officer approached the car and Defendant, he turned on his headlights and parked his unit facing the vehicle. Defendant walked away from the vehicle, attempting to hurriedly walk past the police unit. Officer Stanford testified that as he exited his police unit, he asked Defendant to stop, identify himself by name, produce an I.D., and state his reasons for being there, but Defendant avoided the officer, would not respond, and tried to walk away.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Officer Stanford again tried to question Defendant to determine his identity, where he was coming from, what he was doing, and who owned the vehicle. Defendant became very agitated and stated to Officer Stanford that he knew he was \"barred from the HUD housing property\" and needed to get out of the area. He continually backed away from Officer Stanford and questioned the officer's reasons for stopping him, expressing his belief that Officer Stanford was trying to force him back on the HUD property to arrest him. Officer Stanford testified that he attempted to calm Defendant, but sensing the subject was becoming more agitated and was not going to cooperate, he called for assistance from Officer Chauncey Rupf, who was also on duty that night.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Once Officer Rupf arrived, Officer Stanford again attempted to lawfully detain Defendant until he could be identified and questioned further as to why he was standing next to a parked car at 3:30 a.m. with the car alarm blaring and a beer and other objects in his hand at the HUD housing project, where he admittedly had been barred. Defendant continued to refuse to produce identification, insisted that he needed to \"leave the property,\" and continued to resist all attempts to detain him. When the officers attempted to escort Defendant to the front of the police unit and temporarily detain him for further questioning, Defendant shoved both officers. Officer Stanford testified that he then distanced himself from the Defendant, who took a fighting stance. When Defendant took an aggressive step forward toward the officers, Officer Stanford tasered him. Defendant ripped the taser probes off and fled towards the HUD housing property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Officer Stanford gave chase and attempted to detain Defendant for questioning yet again, giving consistent verbal commands to stop. Defendant then continued resisting and pushed the officers as they tried to detain him. Defendant broke from Officer Stanford's grip and again ran from the officers. Upon encountering Officer Rupf, Defendant continued to disobey verbal commands and flee. Officer Rupf then struck Defendant with her taser. Again, Defendant tore the probes off and ran from the officers. When Defendant reached the middle of the street, he fell. The officers attempted to handcuff him, but he continued to resist, hitting the officers with his elbows. Finally, they were able to successfully handcuff him and arrest him for resisting an officer with force or violence in violation of La. R.S. 14:108.2. Defendant was searched by Officer Rupf incident to his arrest, and three packages of synthetic cannabis were found in one of his pockets. When he was subsequently strip searched at the jail, a plastic bag of marijuana was also recovered from Defendant's person.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Following the Defendant's arrest, Officer Stanford testified that he spoke to the owner of the vehicle, Savannah Pickett, who identified Defendant by name and explained that Defendant had her permission to be inside her vehicle. Further, she explained that Defendant was not supposed to be on the HUD housing property, so he was leaving. Officer Stanford testified he reviewed a list of those barred from the HUD housing property and the list included Defendant's name. Defendant was also charged with remaining where forbidden in relation to his being on HUD housing property, but was not prosecuted on that charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Defendant was formally charged by bill of information with possession of marijuana, fourth offense, in violation of La.R.S. 40:966, and resisting an officer with force or violence, in violation of La.R.S. 14:108.2. Defendant pled not guilty to the charges and was eventually found guilty on both counts at a jury trial held on June 21, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Defendant filed several post-trial motions prior to sentencing, including a motion for a new trial, a motion in arrest of judgment and a motion for post-verdict judgment of acquittal. All of Defendants' motions were heard on October 5, 2017, and denied by the trial court, with extensive and well-articulated written reasons filed in the record. Prior to the hearing on the post-trial motions, on August 14, 2017, the State filed a habitual offender bill of information charging Defendant as a fourth-felony offender pursuant to La.R.S. 15:529.1, to which Defendant pled not guilty. The habitual offender adjudication and sentencing were also set for October 5, 2017. After denying Defendant's post-trial\n   motions on October 5, 2017, the trial judge asked whether Defendant wished to waive the mandatory twenty-four hour sentencing delay required by La.Code Crim.P. art. 873 following denial of his post-trial motions. Defendant specifically did not waive the mandatory delay. Instead of re-scheduling sentencing on the original convictions, the trial court heard the State's evidence on its motion to conduct the habitual offender adjudication hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The trial court then adjudicated Defendant as a habitual offender pursuant to La.R.S. 15.529.1, but deferred judgment on whether the charge of resisting an officer with force or violence in violation of La.R.S. 14:108.2 was a crime of violence for sentencing enhancement purposes under La.R.S. 15:529.1, and scheduled sentencing on the habitual offender adjudication for October 26, 2017. The trial judge eventually found that the conviction of resisting an officer with force or violence in violation of La.R.S. 15:529.1 was a crime of violence, and for oral and written reasons assigned, sentenced Defendant as a fourth felony habitual offender pursuant to La.R.S. 15:529.1 to thirty-two years at hard labor on each count, without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence, to run concurrently. Defendant has not been sentenced on the original convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Defendant now appeals his convictions as well as his habitual offender adjudication and sentences, asserting three assignments of error by the trial court. The State now also appeals, assigning a single error by the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Defendant assigns the following assignments of error on appeal:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   1. The evidence adduced at trial was insufficient to support convictions for resisting an officer by force or violence or possession of marijuana, fourth offense.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   2. The sentence of thirty-two years for resisting an officer by force or violence is illegal.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   3. The sentences of thirty-two years for possession of marijuana, fourth offense, and resisting an officer with force or violence, are constitutionally excessive.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The State of Louisiana assigns the following single assignment of error on appeal:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   1. The trial court erred in applying the recently amended version of the Habitual Offender Law [La.]\n   <strong>\n    R.S. 15:529.1\n   </strong>\n   , as amended by the 2017 Legislature, particularly\n   <strong>\n    2017 Acts \u00a7 282\n   </strong>\n   , to a case involving crimes committed on June 6, 2016, for which he was convicted at a jury trial on June 21, 2017, adjudicated a fourth-felony habitual offender on October 5, 2017, and sentenced on October 26, 2017. (emphasis in original).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    ERRORS PATENT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In accordance with La.Code Crim.P. art. 920, all appeals are reviewed for errors patent on the face of the record. After reviewing the record, we find there is an error patent in that the trial court failed to sentence the Defendant on the original convictions and then vacate those sentences before adjudicating and sentencing the Defendant as a habitual offender under La.R.S. 15:529.1. In doing so, the trial court violated the provisions of La.Code Crim.P. art. 873 requiring a mandatory twenty-four hour delay between the denial of Defendant's post-trial motions and his sentencing enhancement adjudication under La.R.S. 15:529.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   More specifically, for sentencing enhancement purposes, the trial court adjudicated Defendant a habitual offender pursuant to La.R.S. 15:529.1 on the same day\n   the trial court denied his post-trial motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Louisiana Code of Criminal Procedure Article 873 provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   If a defendant is convicted of a felony, at least three days shall elapse between conviction and sentence. If a motion for a new trial, or in arrest of judgment, is filed, sentence shall not be imposed until at least twenty-four hours after the motion is overruled. If the defendant expressly waives a delay provided for in this article or pleads guilty, sentence may be imposed immediately.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On October 5, 2017, the trial court held a hearing on Defendant's post-trial motions for arrest of judgment, motion for new trial, motion for post-verdict judgment of acquittal, and all post-trial motions. These motions were orally denied in open court on October 5, 2017, with extensive written reasons filed on October 22, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   After the presentation of evidence on the post-trial motions, but prior to the court's adjudication of Defendant as a fourth felony offender pursuant to La.R.S. 15:519.1, the court inquired as to whether Defendant wished to waive the twenty-four hour sentencing delay mandated by La.Code Crim.P. art. 873, thus allowing him to be adjudicated as a habitual offender and sentenced that day. Defendant expressly indicated that he did not wish to waive the sentencing delay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The trial court then immediately conducted the sentencing enhancement adjudication hearing and, for sentencing enhancement purposes, the trial court adjudicated Defendant as a habitual offender pursuant to La.R.S. 15:529.1 for written reasons assigned. The trial court then set sentencing on the habitual offender adjudication for October 23, 2017, but did not schedule sentencing on the original convictions. The habitual offender sentencing hearing was later refixed for October 26, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   No sentencing hearing was ever set on the original convictions. Instead, on October 26, 2017, the trial court conducted a sentencing hearing on the fourth offense multiple offender adjudication. The trial court issued written reasons and found that the crime of resisting an officer with force or violence, in violation of La.R.S. 14:108.2, was a crime of violence, and sentenced Defendant as a fourth felony habitual offender to thirty-two years at hard labor without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence for each offense pursuant to La.R.S. 15:529.1, with the enhanced sentences to run concurrently. Defendant timely appealed his convictions and sentences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The habitual offender law, La.R.S. 15:529.1, as the name implies, is a legislative punishment scheme designed to increase or enhance punishment based on recidivism. As such, it is a special statute designed specifically to\n   <strong>\n    increase\n   </strong>\n   Defendant's punishment for a crime based on specifically enumerated prior felonies, with the number and type of prior felony convictions dictating the severity of the\n   <strong>\n    enhancement\n   </strong>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

On remand, for sake of clarity and to avoid confusion, the trial judge should pronounce the original sentences in open court pursuant to La.Code Crim.P. art. 871. The trial court should then articulate reasons for sentencing pursuant to the sentencing guidelines provided in La.Code Crim.P. art. 894.1. After the sentences for the original convictions have been imposed, if at that juncture the district attorney still wishes to have Defendant adjudicated as a habitual offender, a habitual offender adjudication hearing can be scheduled. Defendant\n   would then have the right to file a motion to quash the habitual offender bill of information, urging specific objections. In this case, since the habitual offender bill has already been filed and Defendant has previously entered a not guilty plea on the habitual offender charge, no new arraignment on the existing habitual offender bill of information is necessary unless the state wishes to amend the bill. If the habitual offender adjudication hearing is conducted, and the trial judge finds at the adjudication hearing that Defendant is a habitual offender and adjudicates him as such in accordance with the specific provisions of La.R.S. 15:529.1, then a habitual offender sentencing hearing can be conducted after observing the mandatory sentencing delays of La.Code Crim.P. art. 873, unless delays are waived.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Defendant's third assignment of error, that the sentences imposed were unconstitutionally excessive, and the State's assignment of error, that the trial court erred in applying the 2017 amendment to the habitual offender sentencing rather than applying the provisions of La.R.S. 15:529.1 in effect at the time of the commission of the instant offenses requiring a mandatory life sentence without probation or parole, are pretermitted based on our reversal and remand order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   We express no opinion at this juncture as to whether resisting an officer with force or violence pursuant to La.R.S. 14:108.2 can or should be classified as a \"crime of violence\" pursuant to La.R.S. 15:529.1 under the facts and circumstances of this case. However, we find nothing in the record to reflect that either of the officers participating in Defendant's arrest were injured. This is not to say that the officers were not placed in a position of extreme danger. Fortunately for the officers (and perhaps for defendant), Defendant was not armed. It will be up to the State to decide on remand whether it still wishes to use Defendant's conviction under La.R.S. 14:108.2 as a sentence enhancing conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   We also note that the amount of synthetic marijuana and marijuana seized and tested in this case are relatively minimal.

He was on the curb of the HUD housing project, where he admittedly was not authorized to be. Defendant continued to refuse to identify himself or answer any of the officer's lawful questions posed pursuant to La.Code Crim.P. art. 215.1. Once Defendant began to physically resist his lawful detention for questioning, and then confronted the officers, pushing them and running from the\n   officer's, probable cause to arrest him for resisting an officer with force existed. He then fought with and continued to resist the officers by fighting with and elbowing them. We reject Defendant's claim that he resisted an unlawful detention and arrest and find the record fully supports the jury's verdict. The officer's acted correctly and reasonably based on all the circumstances as articulated by the trial court in its written reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   As to Defendant's claim that the marijuana found subsequent to his arrest should have been suppressed, our review of the record indicates that Defendant and his counsel withdrew his motion to suppress before trial.
