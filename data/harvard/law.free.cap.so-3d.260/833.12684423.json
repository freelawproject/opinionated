He alleged, among other things, that he had signed the child's birth certificate as the father of the child but that he was not the child's biological father. The husband requested that the trial court order DNA testing to determine the child's paternity. On January 30, 2017, the wife answered and counterclaimed for a divorce. She alleged that the husband had had his name placed on the child's birth certificate with knowledge that he was not the child's biological father, that the husband \"[had] chose[n] to act fully in the role of and [to] be the child's father in every way after acknowledging the child as his own at the child's birth,\" that the husband and the child had \"developed a father-child relationship for near[ly] ten years,\" and that \"[i]rreparable harm may result to the child if [the husband] is successfully disproved as the child's father.\" On February 2, 2017, the husband answered the wife's counterclaim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   After a trial, the trial court entered a judgment on June 20, 2017, divorcing the parties and providing, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   \"It is undisputed that the [husband] is not the biological father of the ... child, however he signed an Acknowledgment of Paternity at her birth. The child's biological mother is [R.H.,] the [wife's daughter from a previous relationship] and the [husband's] stepdaughter. Both parties testified that [R.H.] was addicted to drugs at the time of the birth of the ... child and [that the husband had] signed the acknowledgment in an effort to keep the child from being placed in foster care. The child is now 11 years old and has not seen the [husband] in approximately two years.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   \"The [husband] filed for divorce in this matter and has asked the Court to issue a ruling declaring him not to be the legal father of the ... child. Caselaw supports the [husband's] right to contest paternity of the ... child. However, in response the [wife] has asserted ... \u00a7 26-17-608 of the Alabama Code [1975,] which serves to Estopp [sic] the denial of paternity based on several factors enumerated in the statute.

That motion was denied on July 20, 2017. On August 28, 2017, the wife filed her notice of appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    Facts\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The husband and the wife married on October 7, 1995, and no biological children were born of their marriage.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On June 20, 2004, the wife's daughter from a previous relationship, R.H., gave birth to the child. According to the parties, R.H. was using drugs at the time of the child's birth, and the parties had been concerned that the Department of Human Resources might place the child in foster care. It is undisputed that, because of the parties' concerns, the husband and R.H. had executed a form, which was made available by the Alabama Center for Health Statistics and entitled \"State of Alabama Affidavit of Paternity,\" representing that the husband was the father of the child. The husband admitted that he and the wife had taken the child into their home and that he and R.H. had subsequently consented to the wife's adopting the child. Both the husband and the wife testified that the child knows that R.H. is her biological mother and that R.H. has been involved in the child's life, albeit not consistently. Neither the husband nor the wife had knowledge of the identity of the child's biological father.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The husband admitted that he had held himself out to be the child's father, had attended school functions as the child's father, had supported the child, and had taken the child fishing. The child bears the husband's surname. The husband testified that the child is his child for all practical\n   purposes and that she has called him \"daddy\" her entire life. It is undisputed, however, that the husband and the wife had made it known to others that the husband is not the child's biological father because, they said, they did not want people to think that the husband had had sex with R.H. The husband also testified that he had informed the child that he is not her biological father. The wife testified that the child had found out that the husband is not her biological father right before the husband moved out of the marital residence, which was approximately two years before the trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   It is undisputed that, at the time of the trial, the husband had not visited with the child since he had moved out of the marital residence. In fact, the wife had requested a protection-from-abuse order, to which the husband had consented. Pursuant to that order, the husband had not been allowed to be near the child or the wife.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The husband testified that he did not think he should be required to support the child since he is not her biological father. He specifically stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   \"She's not my biological child. I done [sic] this to keep the child with her family instead of being threw [sic] in a system and lost in a system. Yes, I've been a father to the child when nobody else has. But it's not right for me to have to pay for another woman and another man's mistakes. They are the ones that laid down, got pregnant. And I'm going to have to pay for it the rest of my life? It's not right; not to me.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The husband admitted, however, that he had not taken any steps to withdraw his acknowledgment of paternity of the child until he commenced the divorce action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The wife testified that she receives Social Security disability benefits in the amount of $735 per month. According to the wife, after the husband had moved out of the marital residence, she had been unable to pay the monthly mortgage payment, and, therefore, the mortgage had been foreclosed upon. The wife testified that, at the time of the trial, she and the child were residing in public housing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On appeal, the wife argues that the trial court erred in concluding that the husband was not estopped from denying his paternity of the child. Specifically, she argues that the trial court failed to apply the statutory factors in \u00a7 26-17-608, Ala. Code 1975, in making its determination and, instead, relied upon factors that are irrelevant to the determination.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Section 26-17-608 provides, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   \"(a) In a proceeding to adjudicate the parentage of a child having a presumed father or to challenge the paternity of a child having an acknowledged father, the court may deny a complaint seeking to disprove paternity if the court determines that:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   \"(1) the conduct of the mother or the presumed or acknowledged father\n   estops that party from denying parentage; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   \"(2) it would be inequitable to disprove the father-child relationship between the child and the presumed or acknowledged father.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   \"(b) When determining whether to deny the complaint, the court shall consider the following factors:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   \"(1) the length of time between the proceeding to adjudicate parentage and the time that the presumed or acknowledged father was placed on notice that he might not be the genetic father;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   \"(2) the length of time during which the presumed or acknowledged father has assumed the role of father of the child;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   \"(3) the facts surrounding the presumed or acknowledged father's discovery of his possible nonpaternity;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   \"(4) the nature of the relationship between the child and the presumed or acknowledged father;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   \"(5) the age of the child;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   \"(6) the harm that may result to the child if presumed or acknowledged paternity is successfully disproved;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   \"(7) the nature of the relationship between the child and any alleged father;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   \"(8) the extent to which the passage of time reduces the chances of establishing the paternity of another man and a child-support obligation in favor of the child; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   \"(9) other factors that may affect the equities arising from the disruption of the father-child relationship between the child and the presumed or acknowledged father or the chance of other harm to the child.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The Uniform Comment to \u00a7 26-17-608 states, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   \"This section incorporates the doctrine of paternity by estoppel, which extends equally to a child with a presumed father or an acknowledged father. In appropriate circumstances, the court may deny genetic testing and find the presumed or acknowledged father to be the father of the child. The most common situation in which estoppel should be applied arises when a man knows that a child is not, or may not be, his genetic child, but the man has affirmatively accepted his role as child's father and both the mother and the child have relied on that acceptance.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In its judgment, the trial court stated that it had heavily relied on the factor concerning the \"nature and relationship of the child and the alleged father.\" It then noted that the child knows who her biological mother is and also knows that the husband is not her biological father. It further concluded that the husband \"was not held out to be [the child's] father and in fact the [wife] testified that she made a point to let people know he was not [the child's biological father].\" It finally concluded that, because the fact that the husband is not the child's biological father is not a secret, the child would not be harmed by a determination that the husband is not her father.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The trial court's reliance on the fact that it is known that the husband is not the child's biological father in its consideration of the \"nature and relationship of the child and the alleged father\" is\n   misplaced. Our supreme court has stated: \"[T]he United States Supreme Court and this Court have held that biological ties are not as important as parent-child relationships that give young children emotional stability.\"\n   <em>\n    Ex parte T.J.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7014039\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/89/744/#p747\">\n    89 So.3d 744\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 747 (Ala. 2012). Regardless of whether a child is aware of the lack of a biological connection with his or her acknowledged or presumed father, that child is still subject to potential harm from allowing an acknowledged or presumed father to disprove his paternity; indeed, a child stands to lose a parent-child relationship and the emotional and financial support and stability associated therewith. The actual parent-child relationship, not simply whether a child is aware of the lack of a biological connection with his or her acknowledged or presumed father, should be the focus of the consideration regarding the \"nature of the relationship between the child and the presumed or acknowledged father.\" \u00a7 26-16-608(b)(4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Although \u00a7 26-17-608 has not yet been closely examined by an Alabama appellate court, the Superior Court of Pennsylvania analyzed the issue of \"paternity by estoppel\" in a similar case cited by the wife in her brief to this court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Zadori v.
