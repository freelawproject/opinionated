We need not detail the allegations of the petition, other than to note that the record below establishes that Peoples' current incarceration stems from his 2008 trial, conviction and sentence in the Thirteenth Judicial Circuit, (Hillsborough County) for the crime of manslaughter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Peoples is currently imprisoned in Miami-Dade County, and filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in the Circuit Court of the Eleventh Judicial Circuit, raising a number of claims related to his underlying conviction and sentence. As the order on review correctly reflects, the lower court lacked jurisdiction to consider the petition in light of the fact that the petition was a collateral attack on a judgment and sentence issued in the circuit court of Hillsborough County, rather than an attack on the legality of Peoples' continued detention in Miami-Dade County:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   This petition does not test the legality of his detention; it tests the validity of his conviction. Defendant argues that he was immune to prosecution under Florida's Stand Your Ground Law. \"When a petitioner attacks the validity of the conviction by raising issues relating to the trial or to the propriety of a plea, jurisdiction in habeas proceedings lies with the trial court that imposed the sentence and rendered the judgment of conviction.\"\n   <em>\n    Collins v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9059576\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/859/1244/\">\n    859 So.2d 1244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Fla. 5th DCA 2003).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Nevertheless, the lower court's order further determined that the petition\n   was successive and untimely, and that Peoples' filing of the petition constituted an abuse of the writ. On this basis, the court below denied the petition, rather than transferring it to the proper jurisdiction. In this respect, the lower court's order was erroneous.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Once the lower court determined (correctly) that the petition was a collateral attack on a judgment and sentence imposed by the circuit court in Hillsborough County, it was without jurisdiction to address the merits of the petition, and should have dismissed the petition without prejudice to refiling it in the court having jurisdiction, or transferred the petition to that court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dorn v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6891743\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/156/562/\">\n    156 So.3d 562\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Fla. 3d DCA 2015). As this court observed in\n   <em>\n    Broom v.

Regier\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9246011\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/872/217/#p223\">\n    872 So.2d 217\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 223-24 (Fla. 2002) (because petition for writ of habeas corpus raised issues regarding petitioner's detention, the proper court to rule on the petition was the court where petitioner was being detained);\n   <em>\n    Calloway v.

Only the court in which the defendant was convicted and sentenced has jurisdiction to consider collateral attacks on a judgment or sentence, and such an attack must be brought pursuant to Rule 3.800 or 3.850, not by petition for writ of habeas corpus.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Baker v.
