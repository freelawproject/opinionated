As the State correctly concedes, the trial court's failure to instruct the jury as to Florida Standard Jury Instruction (Criminal) 3.7 Plea of Not Guilty; Reasonable Doubt, and Burden of Proof, or any similar instruction, constituted fundamental error.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cavagnaro v.
