Gerson. After the parties stipulated as to the compensation due for Mr. Gerson's land and improvements, a bench trial was held to determine the compensation, if any, due for business losses sustained by Mr. Gerson and his privately-held corporation, Ellvog, Inc. (\"Ellvog\"), resulting from the expropriation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In No. 2017-CA-0229, the Board appeals the trial court's April 6, 2015 judgment awarding Mr. Gerson and Ellvog (collectively, the \"Gerson Defendants\") compensation in the amount of $558,475.00 for business losses caused by the expropriation. In No. 2017-CA-0296, the Gerson Defendants appeal the trial court's July 25, 2016 judgment denying them attorney's fees; and its October 14, 2016 judgment limiting their expert fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   For the reasons that follow, we affirm in part, reverse and remand in part, and amend in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Ellgee Uniform Shop (\"Uniform Shop\"), the business operated on the expropriated property, was established in 1939 by Mr. Gerson's parents in the 1700 block of Tulane Avenue. In 1974, the business was relocated one block away to its location at the time of the taking, 1831-35 Tulane Ave. (the \"Property\"). The Uniform Shop was a well-established retail uniform supplier to the healthcare, hospitality, and religious communities, and was located in the \"heart\" of the New Orleans downtown hospital district, which included Charity Hospital, the VA Hospital, and Tulane University Medical Center. Ellvog owned the Uniform Shop. Mr. Gerson owned the building and the land on which Ellvog operated the Uniform Shop. Mr. Gerson also was a salaried employee of the Uniform Shop, and was the sole shareholder of Ellvog. Mr. Gerson did not charge Ellvog rent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In 2008, Mr. Gerson became aware of expropriations taking place in the foot print of a new downtown medical complex development to replace Charity Hospital and the VA Hospital. Mr. Gerson began searching for comparable property within a one-half-mile radius of his business. In 2009, Mr. Gerson engaged the services of Mark Herman, a real estate broker, to assist in finding a comparable property that could replace the business's unique location on Tulane Avenue. Mr. Herman reported that there was no comparable property available because the expropriation was causing the market to become \"choked off\" and \"stagnant,\" with the result that available property was too expensive. In April 2011, Mr. Gerson relocated the Uniform Shop into a leased building more than a mile away at 3101 Tulane Ave., which was formerly occupied by an auto repair business. Ellvog paid the landlord monthly rent of $2,500.00.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On March 11, 2011, the Board filed a Petition for Expropriation of the Property, and deposited $365,000.00 into the registry of the court as the estimated amount of just compensation. On March 28, 2011, the Gerson Defendants filed an Answer and Reconventional Demand seeking additional compensation, including: (1) \"value in use\" of the Property; (2) inconvenience and delay damages; (3) judicial interest on those inconvenience and delay damages; (4) past and future loss of income; (5) specific expenses incurred in connection with the Board's expropriation actions, including\n   professional fees and advertising costs; (6) expenses of a temporary location of the business; (7) leasehold expenses for a temporary location; and (8) the incremental costs of replacement property (land and building). In October 2011, the Gerson Defendants withdrew the $365,000.00 from the registry of the court, with full reservation of their rights to any further compensation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On October 13, 2013, the Board filed a Motion for Summary Judgment with respect to the amount of \"just compensation\" owed to the Gerson Defendants. On October 21, 2013, the Gerson Defendants filed an opposition to the Board's Motion for Summary Judgment, arguing that there were genuine issues of material fact as to whether they had been compensated to the full extent of their loss. After a hearing on October 28, 2013, the trial court rendered a December 10, 2013 judgment granting in part, and denying in part, the Board's Motion for Summary Judgment. The trial court granted summary judgment with respect to the fair market valuation of the expropriated Property (land and improvements), which the parties had stipulated to be $365,000.00. The trial court denied summary judgment with respect to a determination of any additional compensation due to the Gerson Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Because the parties had stipulated that the fair market value of the Property was $365,000.00, \"[t]he only issue for the court [was] the business economic loss resulting from the expropriation of [the Property] and resulting relocation of [the Uniform Shop].\" A bench trial was held on January 12 and January 13, 2015. On April 6, 2015, the trial court rendered a judgment in favor of the Gerson Defendants in the amount of $558,475.00 as compensation for the business losses caused by the expropriation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The judgment provided that each party was to bear its own costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On April 13, 2015, the Gerson Defendants filed a Motion for New Trial, seeking to recover attorney's fees, expert fees, and costs. On July 25, 2016, the trial court rendered a judgment in which it amended its April 6, 2015 judgment by awarding the Gerson Defendants court costs in the amount of $2,120.89, and copy and printing costs in the amount of $4,113.98. The July 25, 2016 judgment denied the Gerson Defendants' Motion for New Trial with respect to their request for attorney's fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Thereafter, the trial court conducted a hearing on the issue of expert fees. The Gerson Defendants sought $59,985.00 for their two testifying experts. In a judgment dated October 14, 2016, the trial court awarded the Gerson Defendants $9,000.00 in expert fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Gerson Defendants appealed the July 25, 2016, and October 14, 2016 judgments denying attorney's fees, and awarding only $9,000.00 in expert fees. The Board appealed the trial court's April 6, 2015 judgment awarding the Gerson Defendants $558,475.00 as full compensation for business losses sustained as a result of the taking.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    Expropriation Under Louisiana's Constitution\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In general, \"expropriation proceedings derogate from the right of individuals to own property\"; thus, \"the law governing these proceedings is strictly construed\n   against the expropriating authority.\"\n   <em>\n    Bd. of Supervisors of Louisiana State Univ. &amp; Agric. &amp; Mech.

The Louisiana Constitution of 1921 had simply required payment of \"just compensation\" for an expropriation, and the owner could only receive fair market value and any severance damages for the property taken through expropriation. LA. CONST. of 1921, art. 1, \u00a7 2. Thus, damages were not awarded to compensate the landowner for incidental losses he personally may have suffered as a result of the taking.

He stated that the location was ideally suited for the type of merchandise he sold - namely, medical uniforms (approximately 50% of sales); hotel-service industry uniforms (approximately 30-35% of sales); and choir robes, judicial robes, and clergy apparel (approximately 15-20% of sales). Mr. Gerson described his business location as \"unique\":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   1831 Tulane Avenue was about as unique and a great location as anyone in my particular unique nitch [sic] business could want, not only was it across the street from hospitals, not only had it been in business for over 70 years in the same location, ... not only was it truly accessible to public transportation, not only was it very[,] very close to the, not only the medical profession but also the tourist industry. My location, as the term goes, location, location, location, epitomizes that sentence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Mr. Gerson also testified that after Hurricane Katrina in 2005, only two or three businesses in the area reopened. According to Mr. Gerson, when LSU announced that a new hospital was being built in the area, the neighborhood became blighted, and the Board began acquiring buildings in 2008, and tearing them down in 2009 and 2010. Mr. Gerson stated that \"[i]t got to a point where I was a free standing business in the middle of a construction zone.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    Expert Albert S. Pappalardo\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The Gerson Defendants retained Albert S. Pappalardo, a Louisiana Certified General Real Estate Appraiser, as an expert. Mr. Pappalardo's expert report stated that: (1) the single most important factor in finding comparable property was replication of the taken property close to the medical complex; and (2) the payment of the fair market value of the Property alone, because of the unique location of the Property within the footprint of the planned medical complex, was not sufficient to fully compensate Mr. Gerson for his business losses. According to Mr. Pappalardo, because of the confluence of the special factors unique to this location, the \"most equitable way to make the property owner 'whole' [was] to allow for the reproduction or replication of the business enterprise\" in a location as close to the original location as practical. Although Mr. Pappalardo advocated a \"replacement\" cost approach, he emphasized that \"finding a replacement property in the current environment that has most if not all of the attributes of the subject property could very well be an impossibility.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    Expert Michael A. Daigle\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   On February 4, 2010 (prior to the expropriation suit), the Board's expert, Michael A. Daigle - whom the Board did not call to testify at trial - issued a \"Business Evaluation Report\" for Ellvog, d/b/a Ellgee Uniforms. Mr. Daigle is a certified\n   public accountant (\"CPA\") and is certified in financial forensics. According to Mr. Daigle's report, which was introduced at trial, the Louisiana Constitution's reference to the \"full extent of his loss\" focuses not on the fair market value of the assets taken, but instead personalizes the analysis by focusing on the fair value of the owner's pecuniary position in those assets taken, or the fair value of the owner's discretionary cash earnings derived from the assets taken. Mr. Daigle opined that the most universally appropriate model to use for the valuation of a small, closely held, for-profit business enterprise was an \"income\" approach, which was particularly appropriate because Louisiana's constitutional mandate is to value the pecuniary (cash) position of the owner in the assets taken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In his report, Mr. Daigle estimated that the reasonable fair value of the owner's pecuniary position in Ellvog on December 31, 2009 was $361,500.00, which included all the company's net tangible and intangible productive assets. Mr. Daigle stated that he calculated his valuation estimate by capitalizing a projected $63,250.00 in \"Discretionary Cash Flow to Owner\" (\"DCF\") by a risk appropriate rate of 17.5%. According to Mr. Daigle, this rate was determined by the \"build-up method\" in which a risk-free rate, usually the U.S. long-term Bond rate, is adjusted for several business risk factors. To obtain his projected short-term annual DCF of $63,250.00, Mr. Daigle studied Ellvog's reported annual operating revenues and expenses for fiscal years ending May 31, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2009, and adjusted these amounts for non-cash items and personal benefit expenditures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    Expert Ralph J. Stephens\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The Board's expert at trial was Ralph J. Stephens, who is a CPA, an attorney, and is accredited in business valuation and certified in financial forensics. In the four years prior to this action, Mr. Stephens testified as an expert in 15 matters. Mr. Stephens was asked by the Board to determine whether any additional damages were due to the Gerson Defendants as a result of the expropriation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Mr. Stephens testified that there are three approaches to business valuation: (1) an asset approach; (2) a comparable company approach; and (3) an income approach. Unlike Mr. Daigle, Mr. Stephens concluded that the loss of income approach was not appropriate in this case. According to Mr. Stephens, if profits have been lost for a short period of time, the loss of income approach is used. Mr. Stephens stated that if, however, profits are lost in perpetuity, the business has been a loss, so the asset approach is used. Mr. Stephens opined that the uniform business was never profitable between 2004 and 2009 and, after the taking, it had no valuation. Using the assets approach, Mr. Stephens concluded that the value of a 100% interest in Ellvog as of December 31, 2009 was $39,806.00, which was the value of assets in the business. According to Mr. Stephens, if Ellvog had been paying rent to Mr. Gerson, the business would have virtually no value.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    Expert Harold A. Asher\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The Gerson Defendants' expert at trial was Harold A. Asher, who is a CPA, a certified valuation analyst, a certified fraud examiner, and a forensic CPA. Mr. Asher is accredited in business valuation, and is certified in financial forensics. In the four years prior to this proceeding, Mr. Asher testified as an expert at trial and/or was deposed in at least 65 matters.

Mr. Asher's first scenario used the $63,250.00 DCF calculated by the Board's expert, Mr. Daigle, for the fiscal year ending May 31, 2010, which is when Ellvog's cash flow began to be impaired. Mr. Asher assumed that the $63,250.00 figure would grow at a 2\u00bd percent rate between 2010 and 2014. Mr. Asher subtracted Ellvog's actual 2010 income taken from its tax return, $1,830.00, from the $63,250.00 \"But For\" Income, leaving a lost income figure of $61,420.00 for 2010. Mr. Asher repeated this calculation for each of the fiscal years 2011 through 2020, when Mr. Gerson intended to retire and sell the business.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Using Mr. Daigle's DCF of $63,250.00, Mr. Asher calculated the total lost income from May 31, 2010 through May 31, 2014 as $430,440.00. Mr. Asher then calculated Ellvog's future lost income from June 1, 2014 through May 31, 2020 as $418,897.00, using a discount rate of 2\u00bd percent. Mr. Asher added in the \"Terminal Value\" of $408,923.00, which is the value of the real estate and hard assets of the business in June 2020, when Mr. Gerson intended to retire and sell the business. Mr. Asher added together the lost income from fiscal years 2010 through 2020 ($849,337.00) and the \"Terminal Value\" ($408,923.00), which resulted in a present value of lost income of $1,258,260.00. Mr. Asher then subtracted the $365,000.00 already paid to the Gerson Defendants, resulting in \"unpaid damages\" in the amount of $893,260.00.

The trial court erred by awarding speculative lost profits by accepting the conclusions of expert Harold Asher, which were fundamentally flawed and contrary to the evidence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   4. The trial court erred by awarding an excess amount of lost profits to Mr. Gerson and Ellvog.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   5. The trial court erred in awarding future lost profits because Mr. Gerson and Ellvog failed to mitigate their damages by continuing to operate the business.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   <strong>\n    Assignment of Error No. 1: The trial court erred in finding that Mr. Gerson and Ellvog were a single business enterprise\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   The Board contends that the trial court erred in accepting Mr. Asher's damages calculation that was based on the \"faulty premise\" that Mr. Gerson and Ellvog were a single business enterprise. According to the Board, Ellvog is a Louisiana a \"C\" corporation and, therefore, is a separate legal entity from Mr. Gerson. The Board notes that Ellvog files its own tax returns, while Mr. Gerson is an employee\n   of Ellvog, receives a W-2 form from Ellvog, and files an individual tax return.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Mr. Stephens testified that Ellvog should have been paying rent to Mr. Gerson because Ellvog and Mr. Gerson were separate entities. According to Mr. Stephens, if Ellvog had been paying $30,000.00 in rent to Mr. Gerson (the annual rent at the new location), then Ellvog would not be \"worth anything.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   At trial, however, Mr. Stephens admitted that, when doing a business valuation, there is no standard that requires separation of the ownership of an individual and the ownership of a corporation in which the individual is the sole shareholder. And although the Board argues that the trial court committed reversible error by failing to follow the law, it does not cite any authority to support the contention that Mr. Gerson and Ellvog must be treated as separate entities when assessing business losses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   The total economic impact of the expropriation ultimately flowed to Mr. Gerson, as the owner of the land and improvements, and as the sole shareholder of Ellvog. Because all of the benefit of the combined land/business operation flowed to Mr. Gerson, we conclude that the trial court was not manifestly erroneous in finding that Mr. Gerson and Ellvog were a single business enterprise for the purpose of calculating damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   <strong>\n    Assignment of Error No. 2: The trial court erred in denying the Board's Motion for Summary Judgment because the value of the land and improvements exceeded the value of the business as of the time of the taking.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   The Board argues that the trial court erred as a matter of law when it failed to grant the Board's Motion for Summary Judgment on the issue of business losses. According to the Board, the Gerson Defendants are not entitled to be compensated for the value of the Property\n   <strong>\n    and\n   </strong>\n   the value of the business's future income stream because that would constitute \"double recovery.\" The Board contends that the Gerson Defendants were entitled to be compensated $365,000.00 as owner of the land and improvements\n   <strong>\n    or\n   </strong>\n   $361,500.00 as the owner of the future income stream from the business.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   We disagree.

Accordingly, we find that the trial court was not manifestly erroneous in utilizing Mr. Asher's discount rate of 2\u00bd percent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Finally, the Board argues that the trial court erred by not adopting the conclusions of the Board's expert, Mr. Stephens, as set forth in his business valuation report. Mr. Stephens testified that Ellvog had no value at the time of its taking,\n   other than its portable assets valued at $39,806.00. He also testified that, because Ellvog had to pay $2,500.00 rent at its new location, it also could \"no longer be viable\" going forward.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   At trial, the court heard two diametrically opposing views for evaluating the Gerson Defendants' business losses as a result of the taking. The Gerson Defendants' business loss expert, Mr. Asher, considered an income approach as the only way to fully compensate the Gerson Defendants for the full extent of their loss. As a result, Mr. Asher concluded that Ellvog suffered business losses of $558,475.00. The Board's expert, Mr. Stephens, concluded that an asset approach accurately showed that Ellvog only had a value of $39,806.00, the amount of its assets. The trial court was faced with conflicting testimony regarding the business losses sustained by the Gerson Defendants, and ultimately assessed the weight and credibility of the witnesses. \"Reasonable evaluations of credibility and reasonable inferences of fact should not be disturbed upon review where conflict exists in the testimony.\"\n   <em>\n    Villavaso\n   </em>\n   , 14-1277, p. 6,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6828443\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/183/757/#p763\">\n    183 So.3d at 762\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   We find that the trial court's award of $558,475.00 in lost profits was reasonable and supported by the record. In it Reasons for Judgment, the trial court rejected the Board's position that there was only nominal compensation owed to what the Board termed a \"failing business.\" The court especially noted that Ellvog has continued to exist long past the time of its relocation. Based upon the evidence, we cannot conclude that the trial court was clearly wrong in its award of damages. This assignment of error is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   <strong>\n    Assignment of Error No. 4: The trial court erred by awarding an excess amount of lost profits to Mr. Gerson and Ellvog\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   The Board argues that there are only two non-speculative grounds that may support an award of lost profits: (1) Ellvog's $110,591.00 in operating losses at its new location in the three full years of operation between the relocation of the business and the trial in January 2015; and (2) the $117,500.00 in rent paid by Ellvog for the 47 months between March 2011 and the trial. According to the Board, the trial court abused its discretion and committed reversible error by awarding damages to the Gerson Defendants in excess of the higher of these two amounts, which is $117,500.00. This argument is based on the Board's assertion that the trial court awarded damages in the amount of $558,475.00 based solely on Mr. Asher's totally \"speculative\" damages calculation in his alternative scenario.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   For the reasons given in assignment of error number 3, we find that that Mr. Asher's calculation of business losses was not speculative. This assignment of error is also without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   <strong>\n    Assignment of Error No. 5: The trial court erred in awarding future lost profits because Mr. Gerson and Ellvog failed to mitigate their damages by continuing to operate the business at another location.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   The Board argues that the Gerson Defendants' business was \"destroyed\" by the expropriation because there was no reasonable chance of ever making a profit at the new location, which now requires Ellvog to pay rent. The Board then contends that \"the exercise of reasonable prudence\" mandated that Mr. Gerson shut down the Uniform Shop instead of deciding to move to a new location and continue to work until his planned retirement in 2020. According to the Board, because the operational losses that ensued for Ellvog were foreseeable and totally avoidable, Mr. Gerson failed to mitigate his damages and\n   the Board should not be liable for any losses incurred by Ellvog as a result of Mr. Gerson's decision to relocate and remain in business after the expropriation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   Louisiana courts have recognized that when an expropriation disrupts a business, the business has a duty to mitigate its damages.\n   <em>\n    State, Dept. of Transp. &amp; Dev. v.

The record shows that Mr. Gerson's family business has been in continuous operation for nearly 80 years. Mr. Gerson has worked at the Uniform Shop since he was 12 years old. He testified that he enjoys what he does, which is what he \"wake[s] up for.\" Mr. Gerson also stated that he works six days a week because he \"love[s] it.\" According to Mr. Gerson, he intends to keep the Uniform Shop going until 2020, when he will retire at age 76 and sell his business.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   The record also shows that Mr. Gerson began looking for a new location for his uniform business in 2008, when he learned about the expropriation of property in the medical center footprint.

He wrote:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-153\">\n   The amount of compensation to be paid when property is taken is not merely \"just compensation\" as that term has been understood under the fifth and fourteenth amendments of the Federal Constitution and the 1921 State Constitution. Instead, the owner must be compensated \"to the full extent of his loss.\" This is intended to include things \"which, perhaps, in the past may have been considered damnum absque injuria, such as cost of removal,\"\n   <strong>\n    attorney fees\n   </strong>\n   , inconvenience, loss of aesthetic value or business profits and so forth. The loss to be measured is the loss sustained by the owner himself. The Section very carefully says that the owner is to be compensated \"to the full extent of his loss\" instead of \"to the full extent of the loss\" (emphasis added). In other words, the compensation is to be determined subjectively with emphasis on the value placed on the property by the owner instead of on its so-called market value or replacement cost.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-154\">\n   This emphasis will generally require compensation to be much greater than in the past.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   Howard,\n   <em>\n    Louisiana Expropriation Cases\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   According to Delegate Lewis Jenkins:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-157\">\n   [S]uppose a highway comes across the corner of your property. You are offered five hundred dollars for it; it's worth a thousand. At present, there is no way you can get what it's worth because\n   <strong>\n    if you go to court and challenge that offer\n   </strong>\n   and try to get your thousand dollars, and\n   <strong>\n    even if you win, you are going to lose, because of the\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    cost of going to court, hiring an attorney, which you'll have to pay.

Mr. Asher and Mr. Pappalardo testified and 179 pages of exhibits were introduced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   Mr. Asher produced a \"Time and Billing Analysis\" reflecting the work done by Mr. Asher. In 2013, Mr. Asher and Mr. Meyers spent 51 hours doing the following: (1) updating Mr. Asher's 2010 report; (2) preparing for and attending depositions; (3) preparing for Mr. Stephens' deposition; (4) meeting with counsel; (5) preparing a memorandum on Certainty Equivalent (discount rate); (6) preparing a rebuttal report of Mr. Stephens; (7) preparing for and attending\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   hearing; (8) meeting with counsel and document review; (9) reviewing financial documents; and (10) preparing for trial. Mr. Asher's total invoices for 2013 were $26,475.00. In 2014, Mr. Asher and Mr. Meyers spent 29 hours as follows: (1) updating report; (2) preparing for trial; and (3) updating rebuttal report of Mr. Stephens. Mr. Asher's total invoices for 2014 were $11,425.00. In 2015, Mr. Asher and Mr. Meyer spent 36 hours as follows: (1) preparing for trial; (2) preparing trial binders; and (3) preparing for,\n   attending, and testifying at trial. Mr. Asher's total invoices for 2015 were $13,920.00.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   In this matter, Mr. Asher billed a total of 140 hours, and the invoices for his work totaled $51,820.00.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   The Gerson Defendants contend that they retained Mr. Asher to apply his extensive experience to calculate the business losses sustained due to the expropriation of the Property. Mr. Asher was also retained to evaluate and respond to the valuation performed by the Board's experts, Mr. Daigle and Mr. Stephens. They point out that Mr. Asher prepared five reports, reviewed multiple opposing expert reports, gave his deposition, testified at the\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   hearing, and prepared for trial, which was reset multiple times.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   In its Reasons for Judgment, the trial court expressed the importance of Mr. Asher's work to the result obtained. The trial court explained that its $558,475.00 damage award was \"consistent with Ellvog's [Mr. Asher's] alternative calculation,\" which the court found to be \"a reasonable and credible one.\" In its judgment, the trial court adopted Mr. Asher's calculation of a past loss of $334,512.00; a future loss of $298,029.00; and a business valuation of $290,934.00. As Mr. Asher had done, the trial court then deducted the $365,000.00 already paid for the Property. It is clear that Mr. Asher's reports and testimony at trial aided the court in its decision, given that the trial court accepted Mr. Asher's conservative damages figure based on his calculation of business losses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   Examination of the record in this case convinces us that the trial judge abused its discretion in not awarding a higher expert fee to Mr. Asher that is more commensurate with the actual time expended in out-of-court preparation and trial appearance. Mr. Asher's written reports contained in the record demonstrate the thoroughness and quality of the work performed and the time obviously invested by Mr. Asher and Mr. Meyers to gather useful data. We also note that Mr. Asher was subjected to extensive cross-examination by the Board in his deposition and at trial. Accordingly, we amend the October 14, 2006 judgment and award Mr. Asher $45,000.00 in expert fees.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   As for Mr. Pappalardo's expert fees, the Gerson Defendants submitted a Statement of Account for work done by Mr. Pappalardo on behalf of Ellvog, which listed invoices totaling $8,165.00. Mr. Pappalardo also submitted copies of his invoices. The trial court awarded $1,500.00 in expert fees to Mr. Pappalardo. Although Mr. Pappalardo was retained to advise Mr. Gerson with respect to the fairness of the price offered by the Board for the Property, Mr. Pappalardo prepared a report and testified at trial that he did not think that the amount of money being presented to Mr. Gerson compensated him completely for the dislocation of his business, and that \"there was something missing in the pure valuation.\" Mr. Pappalardo's opinions supplied the foundation for Mr. Asher's calculation of business loss: \"[M]y opinion was that this was a very special and unique property and that it required further examination\n   and for Ellvog and Mr. Gerson to be made whole that it required some examination of the business enterprise.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   We find that the trial court abused its discretion in awarding $1,500.00 for Mr. Pappalardo's expert fees. We amend the October 14, 2016 judgment, and award Mr. Pappalardo $5,000.00 in fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   For the forgoing reasons, we affirm the trial court's April 6, 2015 judgment awarding the Gerson Defendants $558,475.00 in damages based on business losses caused by the expropriation. We reverse the trial court's July 25, 2016 judgment denying the Gerson Defendants' attorney's fees, and remand to the trial court for an evidentiary hearing and application of the\n   <em>\n    Williamson\n   </em>\n   factors to make an award of reasonable attorney's fees. Finally, we amend the trial court's October 14, 2016 judgment awarding Mr. Asher $7,500.00 in expert fees, increasing the fees to $45,000.00. We also amend the judgment awarding Mr. Pappalardo $1,500.00 in expert fees, increasing those fees to $5,000.00.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED AND REMANDED IN PART, AMENDED IN PART\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   BELSOME, J., CONCURS IN THE RESULT\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   CHASE, J., CONCURS IN THE RESULT\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-186\">\n    The trial court found that Ellvog had $334,512.00 in past losses, $298,029.00 in future losses, and a business valuation of $290,934.00, so that Ellvog's total damages were $923,475.00.
