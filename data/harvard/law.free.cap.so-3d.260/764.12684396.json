Love\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   This appeal arises from the trial court's ruling that the parties abandoned their divorce proceeding. The plaintiff contends that the trial court erroneously held that the parties had not taken any action in their divorce proceeding for three years since the preliminary default was granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   We find that the parties' divorce proceeding was abandoned on its face, as no steps towards the prosecution were taken in over three years.

The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Louis Bailey and Nidtreas Clayton Bailey were married on December 31, 2002.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On April 25, 2012, Mr. Bailey filed a Petition for Divorce from Ms. Clayton based on La. C.C. art. 103(1). Mr. Bailey alleged that the couple had been living separate and apart since June 31, 2009. Ms. Clayton signed a Waiver and Acceptance of Service on July 10, 2012, which was filed into the record on August 7, 2012. Mr. Bailey filed a Motion for Entry of Default Judgment. On October 9, 2012, the trial court granted an order of default judgment on the divorce.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   No further action was taken in the matter until Ms. Clayton filed a Petition for Partition on May 6, 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ms. Clayton sought to partition the home located at 7610 Inlet Lane in New Orleans. During the proceedings on the Petition for Partition, the trial court noted that a final divorce decree was missing from the record. Thereafter, Mr. Bailey filed a Motion to Acknowledge Divorce Judgment. The trial court found that the Petition for Divorce was abandoned pursuant to La. C.C.P. art. 561, denied the motion, and dismissed Mr. Bailey's divorce action. Mr. Bailey's appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     STANDARD OF REVIEW\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \"Whether an action has been abandoned is a question of law; thus the standard of review of the appellate court is simply to determine if the trial court's decision was correct.\"\n   <em>\n    Heirs of Simoneaux v.

C.C. art. 103(1). Ms. Clayton then filed a Waiver and Acceptance of Service approximately two months after the Petition for Divorce was filed. Accordingly, Louisiana statutory law provides that \"[w]hen a defendant in an action for divorce under Civil Code Article 103(1), ... acknowledges receipt of a certified copy of the petition and waives formal citation, service of process, all legal delays, notice of trial, and appearance at trial, a preliminary default may be entered against the defendant.\" La. C.C.P. art. 1701(B). Thereafter, Mr. Bailey filed the Motion for Entry of Default Judgment pursuant to La. C.C.P. art. 1701, which was granted. However, the preliminary default granted by the trial court was never confirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \"A preliminary default must be confirmed by proof of the demand that is sufficient to establish a prima facie case and that is admitted on the record prior to the entry of a final default judgment.\" La. C.C.P. art. 1702(A). Following the trial court's October 9, 2012 preliminary default judgment, the record is void of activity until the May 6, 2016 Petition for Partition, except for the January 10, 2014 Notice of Change of Address by Mr. Bailey's counsel. As such, we must determine whether the divorce action was abandoned.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The controlling statutory provision on abandonment, La. C.C.P. art. 561, provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   A. (1) An action, except as provided in Subparagraph (2) of this Paragraph, is abandoned when the parties fail to take any step in its prosecution or defense in the trial court for a period of three years, unless it is a succession proceeding:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   (a) Which has been opened;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   (b) In which an administrator or executor has been appointed; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   (c) In which a testament has been probated.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   (2) Terminated by Acts 2007, No. 361, \u00a7 1, eff.

The sheriff shall serve the order in the manner provided in Article 1314, and shall execute a return pursuant to Article 1292.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   (4) A motion to set aside a dismissal may be made only within thirty days of the date of the sheriff's service of the order of dismissal. If the trial court denies a timely motion to set aside the dismissal, the clerk of court shall give notice of the order of denial pursuant to Article 1913(A) and shall file a certificate pursuant to Article 1913(D).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   (5) An appeal of an order of dismissal may be taken only within sixty days of the date of the sheriff's service of the order of dismissal. An appeal of an order of denial may be taken only within sixty days of the date of the clerk's mailing of the order of denial.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   (6) The provisions of Subparagraph (2) of this Paragraph shall become null and void on August 26, 2010.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   B. Any formal discovery as authorized by this Code and served on all parties whether or not filed of record, including the taking of a deposition with or without formal notice, shall be deemed to be a step in the prosecution or defense of an action.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   C. An appeal is abandoned when the parties fail to take any step in its prosecution or disposition for the period provided in the rules of the appellate court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Regarding interpretation, the Louisiana Supreme Court opined:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   [a]rticle 561 has been construed as imposing three requirements on plaintiffs. First, plaintiffs must take some \"step\" towards prosecution of their lawsuit.

Second, the step must be taken in the proceeding and, with the exception of formal discovery, must appear in the record of the suit. Third, the step must be taken within the legislatively prescribed time period of the last step taken by either party; sufficient action by either plaintiff or defendant will be deemed a step.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    Clark v.

In addition to living separate and apart for the last 14 years, the community has been partially partitioned. We agree with Mr. Kambur this is not the type of case envisioned by article 561. There was no clear intent to abandon the divorce proceeding in the instant case. Both parties seemed to be working towards dissolving the marriage. Furthermore, the only objective a dismissal of this proceeding could serve would be to give June Kambur a later termination date of the community.

However, nothing in the record indicates that Mr. Bailey was unable to seek a confirmation of the preliminary default judgment.

As such, we shall examine whether the second exception of waiver applies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \"The defendant's submission for decision of an already abandoned case precludes him from raising the claim of abandonment.\"\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7632106\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/436/530/#p532\">\n    436 So.2d at 534\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"By allowing a suit to be submitted for decision, the defendant clearly consents to have the matter resolved upon its merits.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7632106\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/436/530/#p532\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Ms. Clayton's Petition for Partition refers to her as Mr. Bailey's \"wife,\" but also categorizes the community of acquets and gains as that that \"formerly\" existed. The pleading also referenced the date of the filing of the Petition for Divorce, but no divorce date. Subsequently, Ms. Clayton's Opposition to Motion to Continue Deadline to File Descriptive List stated that she and Mr. Bailey \"ended their matrimony regime\" and that \"several years has passed since the termination of marriage.\" We find that, after reviewing the pleadings related to the Petition for Partition, it is clear that the parties believed they were divorced. However, in Ms. Clayton's August 25, 2017 Motion for Exclusive Use or in Alternative Rent, she notes that \"[t]he Judgment of Divorce was never filed.\" This pleading was filed a day after the trial court stated, at a hearing on discovery and a previous rental reimbursement filing, that the record did not contain a confirmation of the preliminary default judgment of divorce. Ms. Clayton was present, but unrepresented at the hearing on the Motion to Acknowledge Divorce Judgment. Ms. Clayton filed a Motion to Continue and Reset the hearing in order to obtain counsel. However, the trial court proceeding with the Motion to Acknowledge Divorce Judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   We do not see Ms. Clayton's filing of the Petition for Partition as a submission for a decision in an abandoned case. The partition is a separate proceeding wherein she was not requesting that the trial court rule upon the divorce action. While we are directed to balance policy and liberal construction with technicalities, we decline to set a precedent that parties can obtain a preliminary default judgment, take absolutely no action for over three years, and come into court with a viable divorce action. Such a precedent would encourage lackadaisical behavior on the part of attorneys and clients alike. This Court also notes that Ms. Clayton's position on the Motion to Acknowledge Divorce Action is not contained in the record. Accordingly, we find that the trial court did not err by finding that the divorce action was abandoned and affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     DECREE\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   For the above-mentioned reasons, we find Mr. Bailey's divorce action was abandoned on its face, as no steps were taken toward the prosecution in over three years. Further, Ms. Clayton did not waive abandonment by filing the Petition of Partition. As such, we find that the trial court did not err by finding that Mr. Bailey's divorce action was abandoned and dismissing his Petition for Divorce. The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   CHASE, J., DISSENTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   CHASE, J., DISSENTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   I agree with the majority's finding that the divorce action was abandoned on its face, as no formal action occurred from October 9, 2012, the date the trial court granted an order of default judgment on the divorce, to May 6, 2016, the date on which Ms. Clayton filed her petition for partition. However, I dissent from the majority's determination that Ms. Clayton's action, in filing the petition for partition, did not constitute a submission for a decision in the divorce action, as they were two separate proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   I find Ms. Clayton's post-abandonment action in seeking partition waived her right to later assert the divorce action was abandoned, as they are part of the same proceeding. \"[A] proceeding to partition the community of acquets and gains arises out of and is essential and [concomitant] to the separation/divorce.\"\n   <em>\n    Kambur v.
