Our opinion included an order directing Rogers to show cause why he should not be prohibited from filing further pro se appeals, motions or other pleadings related to Eleventh Judicial Circuit court case number F93-28436C. On August 22, 2018, Rogers filed his response to the order to show cause, incorporated in his motion for rehearing and clarification. The motion for rehearing and clarification is denied. In sum, Rogers claims that he cannot be denied the right to file a petition for writ of habeas corpus at any time if he has no other way to challenge his conviction and sentence and goes on to challenge his conviction and sentence, yet again, based on issues that should have been raised in a motion for post-conviction relief in a timely Florida Rules of Criminal Procedure rule 3.850 motion. We conclude that he has failed to show sufficient good cause to convince us to allow him to continue to file pro se appeals, petitions, motions or other pleadings in case number F93-28436C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Having provided Rogers with an opportunity to respond to our order to show cause, we now prohibit him from filing any further pro se appeals, petition, motions, or other pleadings challenging his conviction and sentence in Eleventh Judicial Circuit court case number F93-28436C.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.
