Cereceda, D.C., P.A., and Mark A. Cereceda, D.C. (collectively, \"Appellees\") move to dismiss Appellant Michael I. Libman's (\"Libman\") appeal of the trial court's order titled Final Summary Judgment Against Michael I. Libman. For the reasons set forth below, we dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Libman and Stuart Yanofsky (\"Yanofsky\"), both attorneys, filed a single-count first amended complaint against Appellees alleging breach of contract. The complaint alleged that between 2005 and 2009, Libman and Yanofsky entered into an oral contract with Appellees to bring suit against various insurance companies for monies due for medical services provided by Appellees. It was further alleged that the oral contract provided for the payment of attorney's fees by settlement or court award and that if Appellees decided to dismiss a case, discharge the attorneys, or otherwise not continue with a case, Appellees would be responsible for attorney's fees and costs. Finally, the complaint alleged that \"without permission and consent\" from Libman and Yanofsky, Appellees entered into a global settlement with an insurance company, circumventing their \"right and entitlement to fees.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Appellees filed an answer, affirmative defenses, and counterclaims. Specifically, each appellee filed counterclaims against Libman for breach of fiduciary duty, disgorgement\n   and/or forfeiture of attorney's fees, and legal malpractice. Appellees subsequently filed a motion for summary judgment against Libman on the breach of contract claim. On June 28, 2018, the trial court entered an order titled \"Final Summary Judgment Against Michael I. Libman,\" which stated that Appellees' \"motion for Summary Judgment is hereby GRANTED\" and dismissed Libman's amended complaint. Appellees' counterclaims against Libman were not a subject of the order and remain pending below. Libman subsequently appealed from the trial court's June 28 order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Appellees filed a motion to dismiss the appeal, arguing that the order is not appealable under Florida Rule of Appellate Procedure 9.110(k), which allows for review of partial final judgments \"that dispose[ ] of a separate and distinct cause of action that is not interdependent with other pleaded claims.\" Fla. R. App. P. 9.110(k).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, Appellees argue that the claims asserted in their still-pending counterclaims are interrelated with the breach of contract claim asserted in the amended complaint, and thus the appeal is premature.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   As an initial matter, we note that the trial court's order merely grants Appellees' motion for summary judgment and does not contain language that enters judgment. \"An order that merely grants a motion for summary judgment is not a final order. For an order to be final, it must constitute an entry of a judgment: it is the final judgment that is appealable, not an order simply granting a motion.\"\n   <em>\n    Ball v. Genesis Outsourcing Sols., LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6845394,6845338\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/174/498/\">\n    174 So.3d 498\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 499 (Fla. 3d DCA 2015) (citation omitted);\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    HSBC Bank USA v.

We therefore lack jurisdiction to entertain an appeal from the trial court's order to the extent that it grants Appellees' motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Our analysis, however, does not end here because the trial court's order also dismissed Libman's amended complaint. A trial court's order dismissing a complaint may \"be a final order for appeal purposes.\"\n   <em>\n    Carnival Corp. v.

Each counterclaim arises from the alleged oral agreement that formed the basis of Libman's breach of contract claim. In short, Libman's breach of contract claim is \"interdependent with other pleaded claims,\" i.e., Appellee's counterclaims. It is well-established that \"[p]iecemeal appeals will not be permitted where claims are interrelated and involve the same transaction and the same parties remain in the suit.\"\n   <em>\n    S. L.

Accordingly, we grant Appellees' motion to dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.
