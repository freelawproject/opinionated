Because Ms. Driessen is\n   not Brittany's legal guardian, did not retain the Clinic to represent Brittany or the co-legal guardians (Brittany's sister and Brittany's grandfather), and was not and is not the intended beneficiary of the Clinic's representation of the legal guardians, we find no error and affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Ms. Driessen's complaint for legal malpractice against the Clinic, which represents Brittany's legal guardians, not Ms. Driessen, is based on her disagreement with the characterization of Brittany's disability in the verified Petition for Appointment of Co-Guardian Advocates, her disagreement with the educational program Brittany is enrolled in, and the failure of the Clinic to provide Ms. Driessen with notice of the evidentiary hearing held on March 11, 2014, wherein Brittany's co-legal advocates were appointed. However, as the trial court correctly found, because Ms. Driessen is not the Clinic's client or the intended beneficiary of the Clinic's relationship with the guardians, the Clinic owes no duty to Ms. Driessen.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Angel, Cohen &amp; Rogovin v.

The ward, which in this case is Brittany, not the ward's next of kin, is the intended beneficiary of the attorney's services.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Saadeh v. Connors\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6868927\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/166/959/#p964\">\n    166 So.3d 959\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 964 (Fla. 4th DCA 2015) (finding that the well-being of the ward is \"the very essence\" of our guardianship statutes, and both the attorney and the guardian are ethically obligated to protect the interest of the ward);\n   <em>\n    Zelman v.

We, therefore, affirm the dismissal, with prejudice, of Ms. Driessen's second amended complaint for legal malpractice against the Clinic.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Affirmed.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
