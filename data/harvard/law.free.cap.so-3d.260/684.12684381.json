Scott claims that a donation of land to his father and mother in 2005 was an absolute nullity because he did not sign it in in the presence of a notary and two witnesses. For the following reasons, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On November 17, 2003, Scott bought approximately twenty acres of land. After he bought the property, Scott got married. He and his wife, Stephani, built a house on the property. Subsequently, on June 15, 2005, Scott donated half of the property to his parents, Jessie and Clifton Bridges. His parents then built a house on their half of the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In October 2014, Jessie died. Just a month later, Clifton died. After his parents' deaths, Scott learned that they had left wills in 2007, naming each other as the universal legatee in the event of their respective deaths, and, in the alternative, naming Scott's brother, Barry, as universal legatee. Scott was excluded. Thus, Barry inherited his parents' entire estates, including the donated property. A judgment of possession recognized that Clifton became owner of Jessie's share of the donated property. A second judgment of possession recognized that Barry became owner of the property upon his father's death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On July 13, 2015, Scott filed a petition to set aside the donation, naming his brother as a defendant. Scott and his wife, Stephani, also sought damages for the alleged tortious acts inflicted on them, and their minor son, by his father.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Scott seeks to set aside the act of donation, alleging that he did not sign the act of donation before a notary and two witnesses at the same time his parents signed. Both Scott and Barry filed cross motions for summary judgment, which were denied in July 2017. Barry filed another motion for summary judgment on January 22, 2018, seeking dismissal of Scott's request to set aside the donation. This time Barry alleged that Scott could not seek nullity of the 2005 donation because he did not have \"clean hands.\" Barry argued that Scott donated the property to his parents for \"tax avoidance\" purposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   A hearing on the motion for summary judgment was held on February 22, 2018. Determining that Scott's testimony established that the donation was to avoid paying taxes, the trial court held that Scott was prevented from attacking the donation of property due to his \"unclean hands.\" The trial court granted Barry's motion for partial summary judgment. A judgment was signed on March 5, 2018, dismissing Scott's claim to set aside the act of donation with prejudice. The trial court also declared that the judgment was a final judgment pursuant to La.Code Civ.P. art. 1915. Scott appealed the judgment to this court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    SUMMARY JUDGMENT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Scott wants this court to reverse the summary judgment granted by the trial court. He claims that the trial court improperly applied the unclean hands doctrine to his claim for nullity of the donation of the immovable property that was not executed before a notary and two witnesses. He argues that the basis for the nullity of a donation has nothing to do with an illicit or immoral object or cause of the contract. Scott further argues that, even if the unclean hands doctrine is applicable, there are questions of material fact concerning the reasons for executing the act of donation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \"Appellate courts review summary judgments\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   , using the same criteria that govern the district court's consideration of whether summary judgment is appropriate.\"\n   <em>\n    Greemon v.

Once the threat from the creditors had passed, the father asked the daughter to return the properties. She refused, and he filed suit. On appeal, this court recognized that \"Louisiana public policy does not permit a potential debtor to transfer property to someone else in order to secrete it from potential creditors, in essence, for an illicit purpose.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 881. Given that the father admitted he transferred the properties to safeguard them from creditors, this court found that the transfer was for an illicit and immoral purpose. The court found the daughter was entitled to summary judgment because the father forfeited the right to have the properties returned to him pursuant to La.Civ.Code art. 2033.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In this case, Scott argues he is not seeking to annul the act of donation based on the fact that it was entered into for an illicit or immoral purpose.

In his deposition, Scott stated, \"Well, all of the property was - - the 20 acres is in my name. The so-called donation was really\n   only for some tax purposes. It was always known, and [my father] made it known several times, that all of the property would end up being mine.\" In his affidavit, Scott admits that with the donation to his parents, there were now two homestead exemptions on the property. He further stated, \"Notwithstanding the purported donation, I always considered the 10.354 acres to be mine.\" However, because of the donation, the property was subject to two homestead exemptions and Scott's parents paid the real estate taxes on the donated property for over ten years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   As observed in Comment (c) to La.Civ.Code art. 2033, \"The philosophy underlying those principles is not to reward the recipient of the performance, who by hypothesis is as guilty as the renderer, but to protect the court from mediating disputes between dealers in iniquity.\" Scott was knowledgeable that the donation was for tax avoidance purposes when he signed the document. While he claims it was all his parents' idea, he knowingly went along with the act of donation and did not complain for ten years. He cannot get the benefit of the illicit contract for ten years and then seek its annulment on other grounds. Scott has admitted it was for tax avoidance purposes. This fact is not disputed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   After a de novo review, we find that the trial court properly granted partial summary judgment in favor of Barry dismissing Scott's claim to set aside the donation of the land to his parents. The judgment of the trial court is affirmed. Costs of this appeal are assessed to Bradley Scott Bridges. This case is remanded for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED AND REMANDED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
