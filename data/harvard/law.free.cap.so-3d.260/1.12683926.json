(hereinafter referred to collectively as \"the plaintiffs\") brought this action against the hospital, and its radiological technician, Leland Bert Taylor, Jr., who they allege sexually assaulted them while they were patients of the hospital. The plaintiffs asserted a claim against Taylor, alleging that he had acted negligently and/or wantonly by sexually assaulting them.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiffs also asserted a claim against the hospital, alleging that it was vicariously liable for the negligent and/or wanton acts of Taylor and that it was negligent and/or wanton in its hiring, training, supervision, and retention of Taylor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Along with their complaint, the plaintiffs served the hospital with written discovery requests seeking, among other things, information concerning \"other incidents\" involving Taylor; its investigation into their\n   allegations of sexual assault by Taylor; and its hiring, training, supervision, and retention of Taylor and the termination of his employment. The hospital objected to the plaintiffs' requests, contending that the requests were protected by certain discovery privileges. Specifically, the hospital argued that any information concerning \"other incidents\" by Taylor was barred by \u00a7 6-5-551, Ala. Code 1975, a part of the Alabama Medical Liability Act, \u00a7 6-5-480 et seq., Ala. Code 1975, and \u00a7 6-5-540 et seq., Ala. Code 1975 (\"the AMLA\"). Section 6-5-551 of the AMLA prohibits a party from conducting discovery \"with regard to any other act or omission.\" The hospital further argued that any information concerning its hiring, training, supervising, retention, and dismissal of Taylor, as well as its investigation into the plaintiffs' allegations of sexual assault by Taylor, was privileged under \u00a7 22-21-8(b), Ala. Code 1975, which provides that \"[a]ll accreditation, quality assurance credentialing and similar materials shall be held in confidence and shall not be subject to discovery.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The plaintiffs filed a motion to compel discovery, relying on\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Vanderwall\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12183417\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/201/525/\">\n    201 So.3d 525\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015), which held that the AMLA did not apply to allegations of sexual assault.

The plaintiffs, on the other hand, relying on\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Vanderwall\n   </em>\n   , assert that, because an act of sexual assault by a medical provider does not result in a \"medical injury\" as contemplated by the AMLA, the hospital cannot rely on \u00a7 6-5-551 as a basis on which to refuse to respond to their discovery requests. Whether the plaintiffs' requested discovery is prohibited under \u00a7 6-5-551 requires a determination of whether their claim of negligent and/or wanton hiring, training, supervision, and retention is governed by the AMLA and, more specifically, whether this Court's holding in\n   <em>\n    Vanderwall\n   </em>\n   is instructive in this regard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Vanderwall\n   </em>\n   , a physical therapist allegedly sexually assaulted a patient during the course of treating her for back pain. The patient sued the physical therapist, asserting a claim against him for assault and battery. The patient also sued the rehabilitation center that employed the physical therapist, asserting a claim against it of negligent and/or wanton hiring. During the course of discovery, the patient sought a declaration that her claims against the physical therapist and the rehabilitation center were not governed by the AMLA. The patient, however, dismissed her claim against the rehabilitation center, and the case proceeded against\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   the physical therapist. On appeal, this Court concluded that the physical therapist could not use the AMLA as a basis on which to refuse to answer the patient's interrogatories concerning other acts or omissions on her part because \"sexual misconduct by a health-care provider toward a patient is not medical treatment, and it does not result in a 'medical injury' as such an injury is understood under the AMLA.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12183417\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/201/525/\">\n    201 So.3d at 540\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The hospital contends that\n   <em>\n    Vanderwall\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable, primarily because the patient in\n   <em>\n    Vanderwall\n   </em>\n   dismissed her claim against the rehabilitation center, and\n   <em>\n    Vanderwall\n   </em>\n   thus never addressed whether the AMLA applied to the claim of negligent and/or wanton hiring of the physical therapist. Rather,\n   <em>\n    Vanderwall\n   </em>\n   addressed\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   whether the claim against the physical therapist, alleging assault and battery based on sexual misconduct, was governed by the AMLA and held that the AMLA did not apply. The hospital asserts that, even though the plaintiffs' negligence and/or wantonness claim against Taylor-based on acts of sexual assault-arguably might not be governed by the AMLA, the claim against it, alleging negligent and/or wanton hiring, training, supervision, and retention, would be governed by the AMLA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In other words, the hospital asserts that the plaintiffs' claim against it is not a claim alleging sexual assault but, rather, an independent claim of medical negligence stemming from the hospital's alleged failure to protect the plaintiffs from harm and its alleged negligent and/or wanton hiring, training, supervision, and retention of Taylor. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The AMLA applies \"[i]n any action for injury or damages or wrongful death, whether in contract or in tort, against a health care provider for breach of the standard of care.\" \u00a7 6-5-548, Ala.

Here, the plaintiffs have specifically alleged that the hospital owed a duty to properly hire, train, supervise, and retain its employees, including Taylor; that the hospital undertook a duty to protect patients like the plaintiffs from harm while they were receiving treatment at its facility; that the hospital negligently and/or wantonly entrusted Taylor with the care and treatment of patients at its facility; that the hospital knew, or in the exercise of reasonable care, should have known that Taylor was incompetent and/or unfit to perform the job he was hired to perform; and that the hospital negligently and/or wantonly failed to act and to terminate Taylor's employment upon actual or constructive notice of his incompetence and/or unfitness to perform his job. The plaintiffs' primary contention is that the hospital was made aware of Taylor's sexual misconduct well before October 7, 2015-the date Taylor was arrested and charged with first-degree sodomy and first-degree sexual assault in connection with the incidents of sexual misconduct that are the subject of the underlying action-yet the hospital did not terminate his employment until after this date. The plaintiffs' allegations clearly implicate the hospital's professional judgment in hiring, training, supervising, and retaining Taylor. Accordingly, we conclude that the plaintiffs' claim against the hospital alleging that it was negligent and/or wanton in its hiring, training, supervising, and retaining of Taylor involves a breach of an applicable standard of care for health-care providers and is, therefore, governed by the AMLA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Altapointe Health System, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12674192\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/249/1108/\">\n    249 So.3d 1108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Ala. 2017), a case in which a resident of a group home was attacked by another resident, the resident's father, the plaintiff, sued Altapointe, the operator of the group home, alleging that it was negligent and/or wanton in hiring, training, and supervising its employees; the gravamen of the complaint was that Altapointe negligently and/or wantonly failed to safeguard the resident from the attack in the group home. This Court held that the AMLA did not apply to the father's claim, alleging negligent and/or wanton supervision, because there were no express allegations of medical negligence. Rather, the father's contentions were based \"solely on the fact that the attack occurred in its facility,\" a contention that \"merely applies the discredited 'time and place' argument to the facts of this case.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12674192\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/249/1108/\">\n    249 So.3d at 1113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The plaintiffs' primary contention here is that the hospital was on notice of the alleged sexual assaults before Taylor was arrested and charged in connection with the assaults and subsequently released from his employment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Because we conclude that the AMLA governs the parameters of discovery in this action, we now address whether \u00a7 6-5-551 prohibits the plaintiffs from seeking information concerning \"other incidents\" or complaints involving Taylor, i.e., any act or omission other than the ones that allegedly render the hospital liable. The hospital asserts that two of the plaintiffs have requested discovery regarding \"other incidents\" or complaints and regarding the hospital's investigation of those incidents or complaints. The hospital asserts that, because the plaintiffs have filed their cases jointly, any responses of the hospital to the discovery requests will necessarily discuss facts or issues pertaining to the claims of the other plaintiffs. In other words, the hospital argues that \u00a7 6-5-551 prohibits each plaintiff from discovering information pertaining to any of the other plaintiffs. The hospital, however, has not cited any authority for its argument that the AMLA's \"other acts or omissions\" language would preclude plaintiffs who have filed a joint complaint from engaging in discovery related to the same employee by whom they were all victimized. In\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Ridgeview\n   </em>\n   , this Court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   \" Section 6-5-551, as amended, makes it clear that in an action against a health-care provider,\n   <em>\n    based on acts or omissions in the 'hiring, training, supervision, retention, or termination of [the health-care provider's employees]\n   </em>\n   ,' the plaintiff is entitled only to discovery concerning those acts or omissions 'detailed specifica[lly] and factual[ly] descri[bed]' in the complaint and 'alleged by [the] plaintiff to render the health care provider liable to [the] plaintiff.' Thus, if the plaintiff alleges that the defendant health-care provider breached the standard of care by negligently training, supervising, retaining, or terminating an employee or by negligently entrusting an employee with an instrumentality, then the plaintiff may discover information\n   <em>\n    only concerning those acts or omissions by those employees whose conduct is detailed specifically and factually described in the complaint as rendering the health-care provider liable\n   </em>\n   . Consequently, Hayes is not entitled to discovery regarding acts or omissions by Ridgeview in the hiring, training, supervising, retaining, or terminating of employees other than those employees whose acts he detailed specifically and factually described in his complaint as rendering Ridgeview liable.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11109801\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/786/1112/#p1116\">\n    786 So.2d at 1116-117\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). In their complaint, the plaintiffs specifically and factually describe the sexual assaults allegedly inflicted upon them by Taylor. Because the plaintiffs have consolidated their claims, it would be impractical, if not impossible, to prevent each plaintiff from discovering information concerning the alleged acts by Taylor against the other plaintiffs. Therefore, contrary to the hospital's assertion, \u00a7 6-5-551 does not prohibit each plaintiff from discovering information pertaining to the claims of the other plaintiffs. Accordingly, the hospital has not shown a clear legal right to have the trial court's discovery order vacated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The hospital finally contends that the trial court exceeded its discretion by denying the hospital's motion for a protective order pursuant to \u00a7 22-21-8(b), which provides that \"[a]ll accreditation, quality assurance credentialing and similar materials shall be held in confidence and shall not be subject to discovery.\" As indicated, the plaintiffs' discovery requests included information concerning the hospital's hiring,\n   training, supervision, retention, and dismissal of Taylor, as well as information concerning its investigation into their allegations of sexual assault by Taylor. It is well settled that \"the party asserting the privilege under \u00a7 22-21-8 has the burden of proving the existence of the privilege and the prejudicial effect of disclosing the information.\"\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Fairfield Nursing\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7027140\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/22/445/#p447\">\n    22 So.3d at 448\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In support of its motion for a protective order, the hospital offered the affidavit of Cindy Parten, Director of Professional Standards for the hospital, who testified that the discovery the plaintiffs seek is not part of the plaintiffs' medical charts or kept in the ordinary course of business but, rather, is created as a result of quality-assurance investigations and that the importance of their confidentiality cannot be understated.

I am unable to conclude that the claim at issue in this case involves \"medical negligence.\" I therefore cannot conclude that the AMLA governs the disposition or litigation of that claim. It is for this reason, and not for the reasons offered by the main opinion, that I conclude that \u00a7 6-5-551, Ala.

As a dependent clause, the latter clause does not expand the boundaries established in the first clause's reference to \"the standard of care.\" Specifically, \u00a7 6-5-551 states that the AMLA applies to a \"breach of the standard of care\" (clearly a reference to the\n    <em>\n     medical\n    </em>\n    standard of care), before proceeding to state: \"whether resulting from acts or omissions in providing health care, or the hiring, training, supervision, retention, or termination of care givers.\" Thus, the acts to which \u00a7 6-5-551 applies, whether \"acts or omissions in\n    <em>\n     providing health care\n    </em>\n    \" or \"the hiring, training, supervision, retention, or termination of\n    <em>\n     care givers\n    </em>\n    ,\" must first involve a breach of the \"standard of care,\" i.e., medical care by a medical caregiver. \"Medical care\" by a \"medical caregiver\" is the only type of conduct that triggers the application of the AMLA.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    Obviously, a hospital exists to provide medical care. Just as obviously, however, that fact does not make all tortious conduct that occurs in a hospital facility at the hands of one employed by the hospital subject to the limitations imposed by the AMLA. If it did, the AMLA would govern claims for injuries resulting from the negligent mopping of floors by a hospital employee, the negligent installation or maintenance of HVAC equipment by a hospital employee, the negligent maintenance or repair of a doorway threshold by a hospital employee, or the negligent maintenance or repair of a stairway railing by a hospital employee. Indeed, it would apply to claims arising from injuries resulting from such acts of negligence even if such acts were performed by a physician or nurse employed by the hospital, or the more plausible scenario of a hospital-employed physician or nurse-or radiology technician-spilling a drink on a hospital floor that causes a third party to slip and fall. The point is that such activities or the hiring or supervision by a hospital of those who engage in such activities does not involve the provision of medical care within the meaning of the AMLA. Disputes over injuries arising from such activities simply do not involve the type of \"care\" the legislature was addressing when discussing the \"standard of care\" in the AMLA. See Ala. Code 1975, \u00a7 6-5-540 (\"It is hereby declared by the Legislature of the State of Alabama that a crisis threatens\n    <em>\n     the delivery of medical services\n    </em>\n    to the people of Alabama and the health and safety of the citizens of this state are in jeopardy....

Such activities do not concern the provision of \"medical care\" any more than do the other nonmedical activities referenced above (involving the maintenance of hospital premises, etc.). To the extent the AMLA concerns\n    <em>\n     hiring, supervision, etc., of caregivers, such concern is solely with the hiring, supervision, etc. of caregivers qua caregivers.

If a radiology technician sexually molests a patient, the AMLA no more applies to that activity than it does to a hospital-maintenance employee's engaging in that same activity. Likewise, the AMLA no more applies to the hospital's alleged negligent hiring, training, supervision, or retention of that technician vis-\u00e0-vis such activity than it does to the hospital's hiring, training, supervision, or retention of the maintenance employee vis-\u00e0-vis such activity.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    The alleged misdeed of the hospital in the present case does not raise any question as to whether the hospital engaged in sound hiring or supervisory practices in relation to the quality of Taylor's actions as a radiology technician but, rather, whether the hospital engaged in sound hiring and supervisory practices as to a matter unrelated to medical care. The AMLA, including the discovery limitations of \u00a7 6-5-551 and other provisions, therefore is\n    not applicable. To hold otherwise would mean that an AMLA action depends merely on the location and timing of the individual health-care provider's wrongful acts (i.e., whether he or she was on duty in a hospital or a doctor's office), rather than to the type of wrongful acts in which the defendant allegedly engaged.\n    <footnotemark>\n     4\n    </footnotemark>\n    Such a holding would not merely erode\n    <em>\n     Vanderwall\n    </em>\n    , it effectively would eviscerate it.

In the instant case, the duties allegedly breached by the hospital are stated in the complaint as follows: \"[A] duty to the Plaintiffs to properly hire, train, supervise, and retain their employees\" and \"a duty to protect patients ... from harm while receiving treatment and care....\" These duties of the hospital, by their very nature, are duties that arise in \"the provision of medical services to patients.\"\n    <em>\n     Ex parte Vanderwall\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12183417\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/201/525/\">\n     201 So.3d at 540\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

The discovery restrictions of \u00a7 6-5-551 do not seem to anticipate a scenario where multiple plaintiffs have joined their claims in this manner and thus, by necessity, receive the same discovery.

However, the petition also challenges the plaintiffs' discovery requests related to wrongdoing by Taylor in regard to\n    <em>\n     other patients\n    </em>\n    , namely, patients who are not the plaintiffs. The hospital's motion for a protective order stated:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n    \"Plaintiffs ... propounded their First Interrogatories to [the hospital] and therein sought expansive discovery as to [the hospital's] knowledge, and any actions it took, relating not only to Plaintiffs['] ... underlying allegations of wrongdoing as to co-Defendant Taylor,\n    <em>\n     but as to any other individual who was allegedly assaulted by Taylor\n    </em>\n    .\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n    \"...[The hospital] provided its responses to the aforementioned discovery and asserted appropriate objections to those discovery requests that sought to conduct discovery in violation of\n    <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ala.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%206-5-551\">\n     Ala.

[Section] 6-5-551, Code of Alabama (1975) prohibits discovery of acts of omissions relating to patients other than the patient who has brought the claim.

However, the issue was raised in both the motion for a protective order and in this Court. I would grant the petition and instruct the trial court that the discovery restrictions in \u00a7 6-5-551 applied to the plaintiffs' discovery requests regarding any individual other than the plaintiffs who was allegedly assaulted by Taylor.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    I also respectfully dissent from the main opinion's holding that Ala. Code 1975, \u00a7 22-21-8(b), is inapplicable in this case. That Code section states:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n    \"All accreditation, quality assurance credentialling and similar materials shall be held in confidence and shall not be subject to discovery or introduction in evidence in any civil action against a health care professional or institution arising out of matters which are the subject of evaluation and review for accreditation, quality assurance and similar functions, purposes, or activities.\"\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    The Code section provides that \"all\" quality-assurance materials are protected in \"any\" civil action; it does not provide an exception for quality-assurance materials related to an alleged sexual assault by a\n    hospital employee against a patient. It is undisputed that the hospital investigated the allegations against Taylor and produced certain quality-assurance reports as a result of that investigation. The affidavit of Cindy Parten, quoted in the main opinion, makes clear that the information requested by the plaintiffs \" 'falls within the ambit of quality assurance inasmuch as investigations of complaints relative to [Taylor] were conducted within the confidentiality afforded the quality assurance process and were intended for its protection and privacy of patients as well as employees.' \" 260 So.3d at 8. She further testified that \" '[i]t is essential that the discovery ... Plaintiffs seek be kept confidential to ensure that [the hospital] can continue to obtain complete and accurate information about the qualifications and conduct of its employees, both prior to employment and upon initiat[ion] of any quality assurance investigation.' \" 260 So.3d at 8. It appears to me that discoverable materials gathered for quality-assurance purposes regarding Taylor are protected by \u00a7 22-21-8(b). I would grant the petition and issue a writ of mandamus directing the trial court to enter a protective order regarding those materials.
