See Libertelli v. State,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11078044\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/775/339/\">\n    775 So. 2d 339\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Fla. 2d DCA 2000). However, this dismissal is without prejudice to appellant's right to file a timely notice of appeal once the circuit court enters a final appealable order disposing of all of appellant's claims raised in the motion for postconviction relief still under consideration by the circuit court.\n  </p>\n  <judges id=\"p-7\">\n   CASANUEVA, LUCAS, and ROTHSTEIN-YOUAKIM, JJ., Concur.\n  </judges>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
