Bill. \u201c Samuel Olsen et al. (</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b538-9\" pgmap=\"538\">\u201c This day again came the parties, by their solicitors aforesaid, and .thereupon it is ordered by the court that the defendants, Samuel Olsen and Gouel, Elizabeth Olsen, vacate and deliver up the possession of the premises described in the bill and decree in said cause, to wit: Lot four (4), in the assessor\u2019s division of lots one (1), and two (2), in block fifty-nine (59), in Russell, Mather and Roberts\u2019additions to Chicago, to John Crescio, the grantee in the master\u2019s deed, issued pursuant to law upon sale and failure of redemption of the premises foreclosed upon, in said cause, by ten o\u2019clock, May 20th, 1881; and that, upon their failure so to do, a writ of assistance issue herein without further notice.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b538-10\" pgmap=\"538\">The record shows no bill, service of process, decree, master\u2019s report or petition, as the basis of such order, nor has any diminution of record been suggested. To discuss any question of law supposed to arise upon this record, would be about as useful and instructive, as a discussion of the German professor Zoellner\u2019s theory of a \u201c Fourth Dimension of Space.\u201d All we need say is, that the order has nothing for its support, and</p> <p id=\"b538-11\" pgmap=\"538\">Reversed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
