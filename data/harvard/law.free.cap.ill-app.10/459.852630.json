It is impossible, as a matter of law, to fix any precise time which would be sufficient to warrant a jury in presuming notice.</headnotes><summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b455-13\" pgmap=\"455\">Appeal from the Circuit Court of Cook county; the Hon. Sidney Smith, Judge, presiding.</summary><decisiondate data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AR4u\" pgmap=\"455\">Opinion filed February 24, 1882.</decisiondate><summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AMP\" pgmap=\"456\">Harry Cook, the plaintiff\u2019s intestate, a boy between three and four years of age, was injured by falling through' a hole in the sidewalk, on Loomis street, in the city of Chicago, on or about the 27th day of July, 1878, and some three weeks thereafter died, as is claimed, in consequence of said injury The evidence as to the condition of the sidewalk at and preceding the date of the injury, is conflicting; the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses testifying, in substance, that at that date, and for a long time prior thereto, it was and had been very ruinous and dilapidated, and that the hole into which the plaintiff\u2019s intestate fell had been in existence for several weeks, at least; while the testimony of the witnesses for the defendant tends to show that, both before and at the time of the injury, the sidewalk was apparently in good condition and repair, and that the hole was caused by the removal of a plank by two other boys, immediately prior to the accident.</summary><summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b456-5\" pgmap=\"456\">The deceased left him surviving as his next of kin, his father and mother, four sisters and one bi\u2019Other, the oldest, the brother, being then nineteen years of age. The parents and family of the deceased were living, at the time, on Loomis street, near and within view of the place of the accident, and it appears that they were well aware of the condition of the sidewalk, whatever it was. This appears from the testimony of both the mother and brothez*, the former especially, saying that in consequence of its ruinous condition she had long been in the habit of avoiding it as much as possible.</summary><summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b456-6\" pgmap=\"456\">The deceased, at the time, was plaving on the sidewalk, his mother in the meantime sitting in the door of her dwelling engaged in sewing, and his brother sitting on the edge of the sidewalk, not more then ten or fifteen feet from the place of the accident, but with his back in that direction. According to the brother\u2019s testimony, the deceased, just before the injm-y had his arm around witness\u2019s neck, and had been gone but a, few seconds when witness heard a scream, and turning round, saw that deceased had fallen through the sidewalk, and was hanging suspended between two planks by his forehead and the back of his head.</summary><summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b456-7\" pgmap=\"456(11) 457(58)\">The only other witness who was present at the accident, was a little girl about five years old, and her account of it is, that two other boys who were playing with the deceased, lifted up a plank in the sidewalk, and told the deceased to climb down, and that in attempting to do so, he got his head caught in the position in which his brother found him.</summary><summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b457-4\" pgmap=\"457\">On the trial, the plaintiff, against the objection and exception of the defendant, was permitted to prove that the parents of the deceased were laboring people, not able to keep a nurse, and had n\u00f3 one to care for the smaller children except the mother; that she had no assistance in her housework except her children, and that during a portion of the time they were working out for wages; that the mother herself sometimes went out nursing, and when not so employed, did sewing; the court remarking on overruling the objection, that the evidence was competent upon the question of negligence on the part of the parents of the deceased, but not as tending to show damages.</summary><summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b457-5\" pgmap=\"457\">Among the instructions given to the jury at the instance of the plaintiff, were the following:</summary><summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b457-6\" pgmap=\"457\">4. \u201c On behalf of the plaintiff, the jury are instructed that the city was bound to keep the sidewalks in repair; if they knew of any defect in the sidewalk, it was their duty to have it repaired within a reasonable time to make such repairs after notice, and if it neglected it, then the city is liable for the consequences of the negligence of its authorities. The city would be liable for negligence, if a reasonable time elapsed without repairing it before the accident occurred.</summary><summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b457-8\" pgmap=\"457\">6. \u201c If the jury believe from the testimony that the hole in the sidewalk, and the loose plank therein described by the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses, had existed for several weeks prior to the happening of the accident, the jury are warranted in presuming and finding that the city had actual notice of its existence, and if so, it was the duty of the city authorities to repair it.</summary><summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b457-10\" pgmap=\"457\">13. \u201cThe jury are instructed that it is not necessary to prove by the opinions of witnesses the amount of damages, but the jury are to act on their own judgment and discretion, based on the evidence as to the age and character of the deceased, in connection with the circumstances of the parents and next of kin, and all the other evidence in the case.\u201d</summary><summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b458-4\" pgmap=\"458\">Exceptions to the foregoing instructions were duly preserved by the defendant and thereupon the jury found the defendant guilty, and assessed the plaintiff\u2019s damages at $1,400, for which sum and costs, the court, after overruling the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial, gave judgment for the plaintiff.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b458-5\" pgmap=\"458\">Mr. Julius S.

By the,plaintiff\u2019s thirteenth instruction, however, the jury were told tiiat in the assessment of damages they were to act on their own judgment and discretion, based upon the evidence as to the age and character of the deceased, \u201c in connection with the circumstances of the parents and next of kin, and all the other evidence in the case.\u201d Here, the ruling of the co.nrt made at the time the evidence was admitted was clearly abandoned, and the jury, were instructed to consider in the assessment of damages, all the evidence in the case, including that which related to the pecuniary circumstances of the parents and next of kin of the deceased. This was clearly erroneous, as is shown by the decision of the Supreme Court in Ill. Cent. R. R. Co. v. Baches, 55 Ill. 379; and of this court in C. &amp; N. W. R. W. Co. v. Howard, 6 Bradwell, 569. This error is necessarily fatal to the judgment.</p> <p id=\"b460-5\" pgmap=\"460\">There is also error in the plaintiff\u2019s fourth instruction. The proposition is there announced without limitation or qualification, \u201c that the city was bound to keep the sidewalk in repair.\u201d In City of Chicago v. Watson, 6 Bradwell, 344, we had occasion to review an instruction containing this precise proposition, and it is unnecessary for us to repeat what we then said. It is sufficient to say that a municipal corporation is not bound, absolutely and unqualifiedly, to keep its sidewalks in repair, but only to exercise reasonable care and diligence to that end. City of Chicago v. Bixby, 84 Ill 82; Roberts v. City of Chicago, 26 Id. 249; City of Chicago v. McGiven, 78 Id. 347; City of Macomb v. Smithers, 6 Bradwell, 470; City of Joliet v. Walker, 7 Id. 267; City of Monmouth v. Sullivan, 8 Id. 50.</p> <p id=\"b460-6\" pgmap=\"460(88) 461(23)\">The plaintiff\u2019s sixth instruction is also liable to just criticism. What length of time would be sufficient to charge a municipal corporation with notice of a defect in a street or sidewalk, is a question of fact to be determined by the jury, according to the peculiar circumstances of each case. It must depend upon the nature of the defect, its situation, the degree of its exposure to ordinary observation, and various other circumstances, which in no two cases are precisely alike, and it is therefore impossible to fix, as a matter of law, upon any precise time which would be sufficient to warrant a jury in presuming notice.</p> <p id=\"b461-4\" pgmap=\"461\">Courts, in their instructions to juries, should limit themselves to the decision of questions of law, and all questions of fact should be submitted to the jury for their determination.</p> <p id=\"b461-5\" pgmap=\"461\">Various other points have been raised by counsel for the appellant, which we do not deem it necessary to consider, but for the errors in the foregoing instructions, the judgment will be reversed and the cause remanded.</p> <p id=\"b461-6\" pgmap=\"461\">Reversed and remanded.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
