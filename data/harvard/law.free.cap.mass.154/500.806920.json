The answer contained a general denial, and set up an accord and satisfaction by a gift to the plaintiff in the testator\u2019s will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b522-10\">At the trial in the Superior Court, before <em>Staples, </em>J., there was evidence that the plaintiff rendered the services in question to the testator from March, 1883, to the date of the testator\u2019s death, on August 12,1886, receiving from him in his lifetime no pay therefor beyond two small sums of money ; that the testator, by his will, which was dated August 6, 1886, and- of which Dr. Charles H. Davis and Sarah A. Williams were two of the attesting witnesses, gave to the plaintiff certain real estate, which she had sold for $8,000; and that the plaintiff knew before the testator\u2019s death that he intended to give her this real estate in his will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b522-11\">The defendant called Dr. Davis, who testified that he \u201c was present when George Patridge\u2019s will was made,\u201d and, against the plaintiff\u2019s objection, was permitted to testify that the said George, when the will was being written, said that he wanted the plaintiff to have the house, because she had always been kind to him and faithful, and done the right thing for him, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>and that would be in compensation for what she had done. He did not remember that the plaintiff was in the room when this was said, but had the \u201c impression \u201d that she was; that she was about the house, in the room or near it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b523-5\">Sarah A. Williams, called by the defendant, was permitted to testify, against the plaintiff\u2019s objection, that she \u201c was present when George Patridge executed his will\u201d; that the plaintiff was not present; that Micajah, his brother, said to George, \u201c You want to leave the house to Rebekah, because she has done so much for you?\u201d and George nodded his head, and mumbled, \u201cYes.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b523-6\">The judge refused to rul\u00e9, as requested by the plaintiff, that there was no evidence of satisfaction of the plaintiff\u2019s claim, and instructed the jury that, if it was understood and intended by and between the plaintiff and George Patridge that the provision made for her in the will should be and should operate as compensation for her services, and the same was so accepted by her when the will became effectual, then she cannot now claim any further compensation; and that the evidence of Dr. Davis was not competent, upon the question of an agreement between George Patridge and the plaintiff, if they should find that the plaintiff was not present at the time of the conversation recalled by him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b523-7\">The jury returned a verdict for the defendant; and the plaintiff alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b523-8\"><em>F.

The answer is a general denial, and accord and satisfaction by a devise and legacy in the testator\u2019s will. If a conversation took place between the testator and a third person in the presence of the plaintiff, to the effect that her services were to be paid for in that way, it would be admissible to prove the fact. <em>Frost </em>v. <em>Sumner, </em>149 Mass. 98. The testimony of Dr. Davis was open to the interpretation that, although his memory of the plaintiff\u2019s presence at the conversation which he related was not visual, it still was memory of a fainter degree, sufficient for belief. So interpreted, it warranted a finding that she was present. <em>Stockhridge </em>v. <em>West Stockbridge, </em>12 Mass. 400. The jury were instructed that Dr. Davis\u2019s evidence was not competent, if they should find that the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>was not present at the conversation testified to by him. This being the presiding justice\u2019s view of the law, expressly stated to the jury, it is quite incredible that he should have applied a contradictory rule the next moment to the testimony of Sarah Williams ; and we are compelled to require with some strictness that the excepting party should make it clear that the testimony was admitted improperly.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">The bill of exceptions does not exclude the possibility, and some of us think that it shows affirmatively, that the conversation testified to by Williams was the same as that testified to by Dr. Davis; so that the evidence and instructions as to the plaintiff\u2019s presence applied to it also.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">Dr. Davis and Williams both were witnesses to the will. The occasion described by the former was when the will was made, by the latter, when Patridge executed his will. There is nothing in the two accounts of what was said inconsistent with its being the same conversation. Evidently the judge assumed that both witnesses were speaking of the same conversation, and, although the bill of exceptions suggests the possibility that they were not doing so, it does not show the fact to have been that way rather than the other. Upon this view of the evidence, without going further, it was admissible, and the ruling requested, that there was no evidence of satisfaction of the plaintiff\u2019s claim, was properly refused. <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
