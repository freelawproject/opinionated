Sts. c. 112, \u00a7 212, for causing the death of the plaintiff\u2019s intestate, Dacey. Dacey was killed by a train running off the track while he was in a water-closet, which there was evidence tending to show to have been built without right within the defendant\u2019s location. The jury were instructed that, if Dacey was a trespasser, the defendant owed him no duty beyond abstaining from reckless or wanton conduct toward him. The jury found for the defendant ; and the plaintiff excepted. If Dacey had been on the defendant\u2019s track, there is no question that the ruling would have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>been right. <em>McCreary </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Maine Railroad, </em>153 Mass. 300. The ground of the decision cited is that the statute does not abolish the common law rule embodied in the instruction, and that rule applies with equal force to trespassers anywhere within the location. Whether this construction of the statute be reached by a broad interpretation of the exception of people \u201c being upon its [the defendant\u2019s] road contrary to law,\u201d which qualifies the civil as well as the criminal liability, (see St. 1881, c. 199, \u00a7 1,) or by reading in an exception implied by common sense, does not matter for the purposes of this case. Compare <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Carew Manuf. Co. </em>143 Mass. 470, 471; <em>Blodgett </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>8 Allen, 237, 238. <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
