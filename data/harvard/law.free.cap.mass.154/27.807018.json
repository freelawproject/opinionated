The plaintiff paid the notes in question in February, 1877, and in the March following the defendant executed and the plaintiff accepted a paper writing purporting to be a warranty deed of such parcel, which was duly recorded in 1880. In 1881 the plaintiff conveyed the land by a deed of warranty to his brother, Cornelius Wellington, for a valuable consideration. In 1887 Cornelius conveyed the land to a third person by deed, at which time it was ascertained that the instrument purporting to be a deed given by the defendant to the plaintiff in March, 1877, had no seals upon it, whereupon Cornelius brought a bill in equity in the name of the plaintiff to compel the defendant to affix seals to that instrument. During the pendency of the bill, Cornelius, in order to perfect his own title and that of those claiming under him by perfecting the title of the plaintiff, and. to avoid loss and litigation, paid to the defendant the sum of fifteen hundred dollars. By the agreement of the parties, the title was perfected by placing seals upon the instrument of March, 1877, whereupon the bill in equity was dismissed without prejudice; and subsequently Cornelius demanded of the plaintiff the amount paid by him to the defendant, and the plaintiff paid the same to him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b50-5\">If upon these facts the plaintiff was not entitled to recover, judgment was to be entered upon the verdict; otherwise, a new trial was to be granted. .</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b50-6\"><em>J.

After the execution of the instrument the plaintiff conveyed the land described in it to his brother Cornelius. Later, Cornelius brought a bill in equity in the name of the plaintiff, Darius, to compel the sealing of the instrument, and then, seemingly before any further step had been taken in the cause, Cornelius paid the defendant fifteen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>hundred dollars, and the defendant caused the proper seals to be affixed. This was done by the agreement of the parties, including, as we understand the report, the plaintiff, Darius, who was the nominal plaintiff in the bill in equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">If the plaintiff had paid the money, the sealing of the deed would have imported satisfaction of the plaintiff\u2019s claim on the covenant, and the same must be taken to be true when the money was paid by a third person with the plaintiff\u2019s assent, the whole transaction being a settlement of a controversy upon that covenant then pending in. the plaintiff\u2019s name. If the payment had not been with the plaintiff\u2019s assent, it is difficult to see how he could recover more than nominal damages. For his case is that the defendant\u2019s agreement still binds him, and if so, the payment made by the plaintiff\u2019s brother in order to induce the defendant to do what he had covenanted to do by this same agreement was not necessary, but the defendant might have been compelled to do it by prosecuting the bill in equity. Therefore the plaintiff was not bound by the covenants in his deed to indemnify his brother for the payment, and cannot recover what he paid from the defendant. Without considering further objections to the plaintiff\u2019s recovery, we are of opinion that the ruling for the defendant was right.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">\n<em>Judgment on the verdict.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
