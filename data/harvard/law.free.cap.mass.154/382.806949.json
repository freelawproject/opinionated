On cross-examination, he testified that he had never before worked on this cutting machine ; that Kelly and two other workmen previously had stopped him from working at feeding it; and that he knew that the rollers would draw in his fingers, but thought that, if his fingers got caught, he could pull them out.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b405-4\">The plaintiff also testified, that after the accident happened he was taken to the office of one Pierce, the foreman, and Pierce asked him how the accident happened, and he told him. The plaintiff was then asked what Pierce said, it being proposed to show that Pierce said, \u201c It was just like Rolf to set you at work at a dangerous machine you did not know anything about.\u201d The judge excluded the question, upon the defendant\u2019s objection, and the plaintiff excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b406-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>Two other witnesses for the plaintiff were asked, in the course of their examination, whether the plaintiff was \u201c above or below the average intelligence of a boy of his age.\u201d The judge, upon the defendant\u2019s objection, excluded this question ; and the plaintiff excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b406-5\">The judge ruled that the action could not be maintained upon the evidence, and ordered a verdict for the defendant; and the plaintiff alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b406-6\"><em>G.

The question to Pierce was properly excluded. So far as appears, his only knowledge of the circumstances of the accident came from what the plaintiff had just told him. If he said that it was just like Rolf to set the plaintiff at work at a dangerous machine he did not know anything about, the statement so far as it involved matters of fact rested wholly upon what the plaintiff had just told him; and so far as it involved matter of opinion, the defendant was not bound by it.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-9\">2. Two witnesses were asked whether the plaintiff was \u201c above or below the average intelligence of a boy of his age.\u201d His age was eighteen years and eight months. The questions were properly excluded. They did not go to the extent of showing that he was manifestly incapable of understanding the risk without instruction, so that the defendant knew, or from his appearance ought to have known, that cautions and instructions were necessary. <em>Ciriack </em>v. <em>Merchants' Woolen Co. </em>151 Mass. 152. The case does not call for any nice consideration of what might be shown in the case of a young child, or under other circumstances. It is enough to say, that under the circumstances of the present case, in view of the plaintiff\u2019s age, and of his long examination as a witness in the presence of the jury, the questions were of no material significance.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-10\">3. The ruling that there was not sufficient evidence to warrant the jury in finding a verdict for the plaintiff was clearly right. There was nothing to show that he had ever been set to work feeding such a machine, which was the only dangerous part of the work. He testified himself that three different workmen had stopped him from working at feeding. Rolf did not tell him to feed the machine, and there was no evidence that Rolf <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>knew that the plaintiff had taken or was likely to take any other than his usual place at the other end of the machine. Without entering upon other considerations, we see no evidence of negligence on the part of the defendant. There was no need of instructing the plaintiff as to work which he was not expected to do. <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
