The cases were tried together in the Superior Court, before Aldrich, J., who allowed a bill of exceptions, in substance as follows.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b122-10\">It appeared from the plaintiff\u2019s- evidence that he was the owner of an estate in Winchester, worth from $25,000 to $40,000, upon which were a dwelling-house and factory for the manufacture of woollen goods; that the city of Boston, claiming to act under the St. of 1881, c. 303,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> had taken lands in Winchester <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>adjoining the plaintiff\u2019s estate, and on the line of a sewer which was built by it through Winchester, under the St. of 1875, c. 202, and emptied into the Mystic Lower Pond to the extent of 300,000 or 400,000 gallons of sewage a day; that this sewage had been taken by the city, against the plaintiff\u2019s objection, from the sewer into canals, basins, and tanks built by it on the land so taken, in order to treat such sewage so as to free it from noxious and offensive matter; that the sewage thus treated gave forth noxious and offensive odors, which penetrated to the adjoining estate of the plaintiff, and rendered him and many of his workmen ill, and caused them great discomfort; that for about one month, in August, 1883, the plaintiff was obliged to close his factory on account of such odors; that the sewage also percolated through the soil and into the plaintiff\u2019s estate, and rendered the water in the wells on the estate unfit for drinking or for manufacturing purposes; and that the plaintiff\u2019s estate and the plaintiff\u2019s goods were greatly injured both in market value and in prestige.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b123-5\">At the close of the plaintiff\u2019s evidence, the defendant, who offered no evidence, requested the judge to rule that the plaintiff could not maintain his action; but the judge refused so to rule, and submitted the case to the jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b123-6\">The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff in each case; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b123-7\"><em>A.

For purposes beneficial to the water supply of Boston, the city was authorized to take such lands in Woburn or Winchester, on or near the line of a sewer, as it should deem necessary, and construct works in order to treat sewage, and free it from noxious and offensive matter and properties. The selection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>of the lands to be taken, within the prescribed limits, was left to the city. It does not appear that it was necessary to create such a nuisance as the plaintiff has suffered from. We need not consider whether the Legislature had power to authorize such an injury without payment of compensation. The general rule is, that the Legislature may authorize small nuisances without compensation, but not great ones. <em>Sawyer </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>136 Mass. 239, 243. But it will not be assumed that the Legislature intended to authorize a nuisance, unless this is the necessary result of the powers granted. <em>Morse </em>v. <em>Worcester, </em>139 Mass. 389, 391. <em>Boston Belting Co. </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>149 Mass. 44. <em>Baltimore f Potomac Railroad </em>v. <em>Fifth Baptist Church, </em>108 U. S. 317. See also <em>Metropolitan Asylum District </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>6 App. Cas. 193; <em>London, Brighton, &amp; South Coast Railway </em>v. <em>Truman, </em>11 App. Cas. 45; <em>Cogswell </em>v. <em>New York, New Haven, &amp; Hartford Railroad, </em>103 N. Y. 10, 21; <em>Edmondson </em>v. <em>Moberly, </em>98 Misso. 523. In the statute of 1881, the Legislature enacted that one nuisance should cease, and authorized the taking of lands and construction of works for the purpose of treating sewage, giving a wide discretion as to the selection of the place, it provided for compensation for the taking of the lands, but none for other injury to owners of lands, and upon well established rules it must be deemed that the Legislature did not intend to sanction a serious nuisance to lands not taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">It is contended by the plaintiff, that the nuisance to his land is such as to amount to a substantial taking of it; to which the defendant replies, that, if so, the plaintiff\u2019s sole remedy is under the proceedings provided for in the statute, and not by an action at law. Without going into the vexed question of what sort of a nuisance may amount to a taking of property, it is enough for present purposes to say that here was no taking of the plaintiff\u2019s land within the meaning of the St. of 1881, c. 303, \u00a7 3. That section only provides compensation for lands actually taken by the city, and does not include compensation for such an injury as was shown in this case. The statutory remedy, therefore, was not open to the plaintiff, and he was left to his action at law.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">\n<em>Fxceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
