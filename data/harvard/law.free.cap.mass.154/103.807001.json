At the trial in the Superior Court, before <em>Levthrop, </em>J., the defendant testified, in substance, that before June 10, 1887, he had rendered certain services for the intestate, who was his brother in law, for which he had not been paid, and that on that date the intestate, being on the eve of departing for San Francisco, delivered the coupons in question to him, and told him to remit the proceeds thereof to the intestate, but if the intestate never came back, to keep the coupons the proceeds of which had not been remitted, as partial compensation for his services. The defendant in one portion of his testimony stated that the intestate said, \u201c Keep them in part pay for services,\u201d and in another, that he said, \u201c You. keep these, and if the worst should happen that I fear, you will have these to partly pay you.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b125-10\">The plaintiff requested the judge to instruct the jury, that, if Dama had a right to the proceeds of the coupons if he had lived, there was no valid gift or pledge of the coupons to the defendant in case of his death. The judge declined so to instruct the jury, and instructed them, in substance, that, if they believed the testimony of the defendant, \u2014 to wit, \u201cthat, inasmuch as he had rendered certain services to Mr. Dama prior to that time, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>made certain advances, he was to take those coupons, and although he was to remit them as they became due, if Mr. Dama lived, still, if the worst happened and he did not come back, he was to keep these to pay himself for, or in part compensation for, what was due,\u201d\u2014the arrangement to which he testified gave him a valid title to the coupons, and their proceeds so far as not remitted to Dama at the time of his death.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b126-5\">The jury returned a verdict for the defendant; and the plaintiff alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b126-6\">The case was argued at the bar in January, 1891, and after-wards, in June following, was submitted on the briefs to <em>Allen, Holmes, Morton, </em>and <em>Lathrop, </em>JJ.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b126-7\"><em>J.

The real difference between the plaintiff and the defendant, in their argument before us, is in their interpretation of the defendant\u2019s evidence. The defendant testified, in different forms, that Dama, after delivering the coupons to him, told him to remit the proceeds to Dama, who was just returning to San Francisco, but if Dama never came back, to keep them in part pay for services. The plaintiff treats this as language looking only to the future, as in <em>Fearing </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>149 Mass. 12. But it was at least possible for the jury to find that Dama purported to transfer a present right to the defendant, and that the case stood as if Dama had delivered the coupons to the defendant at the moment of the conversation as his property, whether by way of gift or payment is not material, on the condition, however, that, if Dama was alive when the coupons fell due, then the proceeds should be remitted to him. If the jury found that to be what happened, the defendant got a good title to the coupons not due at Dama\u2019s death. This is what we understand the instructions to the jury to mean. See <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Ney, </em>125 Mass. 590; <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Hackett, </em>12 Gray, 227.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-10\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
