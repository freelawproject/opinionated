At the trial in the Superior Court, before Thompson, J., it appeared that the defendant had kept a hotel in the city of Worcester for four years prior to the date of the complaint, and.that he had previously kept a hotel in the town of Shrewsbury. The defendant\u2019s attorney, in opening the defence to the jury, stated that the defendant used to be engaged in the business of liquor keeping, and was convicted of the same, but that when he moved to his present quarters he gave it up. The defendant testified in his own behalf, and was asked, on cross-examination, \u201c Did you not sell intoxicating liquor at your hotel in the town of Shrewsbury four or five years ago ? \u201d The judge admitted the question, and the defendant answered that he had not sold it himself, but that his wife and mother in law, who lived with him, sold it at his place, and that he knew that they were so selling; and the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b509-11\">The government offered evidence that, when the officers searched the defendant\u2019s premises, just prior to the making of this complaint, there were several persons in the bar-room in an intoxicated condition, among whom was one Carr. Upon being called as a witness by the defendant, Carr denied that he was intoxicated at the time, and further stated that he had not drunk intoxicating liquor for the past two years. One Fay, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>government witness, after testifying that he had worked for several years in the same shop with Carr, was asked by the District Attorney, \u201c What have been Carr\u2019s habits for the past two years as to the use of intoxicating liquors ? \u201d The judge admitted the question, against the defendant\u2019s objection, and Fay replied that Carr had often been in a state of intoxication for a week at a time.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b510-5\">The jury returned a verdict of guilty; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b510-6\"><em>H.

The admission of the first question did the defendant no harm, as his counsel had admitted the fact in his opening, and as the defendant\u2019s answer, so far as responsive, denied it.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-9\">2. Carr\u2019s denial that he had drunk intoxicating liquor for the past two years went to support his denial that he was drunk at the time in question, and indeed would seem to have been the form in which the latter denial was put. Therefore it was subject to contradiction. See <em>Riddell </em>v. Thayer, 127 Mass. 487, 489.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-10\">\n<em>Hxceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
