The plaintiff introduced evidence, which was contradicted, that in 1884 the defendant employed the plaintiff, through her husband, to make the window in question, and agreed to pay therefor not less than $1,600; that in January, 1886, upon the completion of the window, the plaintiff\u2019s husband went to the defendant for a payment on account, and was by the defendant sent to one Wheeler, from whom he received the sum of $500, and, without reading it or knowing its contents, signed a receipt written by Wheeler. The defendant contended, and introduced evidence tending to show, that the plaintiff had admitted that the proceeds of the course of lectures delivered by the Rev. H. B. Carpenter in the winter of 1884-85 were to be received by her in full payment for the window. The defendant also put in evidence the following receipt, being that signed by the plaintiff\u2019s husband: \u201c Boston, January 21,1886. Received of Daniel Wheeler, Treas., five hundred dolls., being amount received from lectures given by Rev. H. B. Carpenter in Hollis Street Church for memorial window to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>put into said church as per agreement. Donald Macdonald.\u201d The judge refused to rule, as requested by the defendant, that the receipt was conclusive evidence of full payment and satisfaction, and admitted evidence offered by the plaintiff tending to show that the $500 paid by Wheeler was not received, or agreed to be received, by the plaintiff in full payment for the window.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b175-5\">The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b175-6\">The case was argued at the bar in January, 1891, and after-wards, in June following, was submitted to all the judges except <em>Field, </em>C.

Bates, </em>to the point that the receipt was a contract as well as a receipt, and that paroi evidence was inadmissible to contradict it, cited <em>Langdon </em>v. <em>Langdon, </em>4 Gray, 186; <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Cambridge, </em>3 Allen, 474; <em>James </em>v. <em>Bligh, </em>11 Allen, 4; <em>Hurley </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>98 Mass. 545; <em>Goss </em>v. <em>Ellison, </em>136 Mass. 503; <em>Squires </em>v. <em>Amherst, </em>145 Mass. 192.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b175-9\"><em>M. Holbrook, </em>(L. <em>W. Howes </em>with him,) for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b175-10\">Morton, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Axq\">The only exception in this case is that taken by the defendant to the refusal of the court to rule, as requested by him, that the receipt was conclusive evidence of full payment and satisfaction. This presents the question whether the receipt is to be regarded as a contract on the plaintiff\u2019s part, in which she agrees to receive in satisfaction and discharge of her claim the amount named, in which case paroi evidence would not be admissible to vary or control it, or whether it could be properly treated as an acknowledgment merely on the part of the plaintiff that she had received the sum named in it towards the amount due her on account of her claim; and we think it is very clear that it could be so treated, and that the refusal of the court to give the instruction requested by the defendant was correct. The receipt does not purport on its face to be a satisfaction or discharge of the plaintiff\u2019s claim, or an agreement that the amount named in it was received in full, or that she would take the proceeds of Mr. Carpenter\u2019s lectures in payment of the window. The case therefore differs from those cited and relied on by the defendant, in which some one of these elements appeared. The receipt simply acknowledges the payment by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>Mr. Wheeler, as treasurer, of five hundred dollars, \u201c being amount received from lectures given by Rev. H. B. Carpenter in Hollis Street Church for memorial window to be put into said church as per agreement.\u201d It is plain that there is nothing here to show that the sum named was paid or received in full for, or in payment or satisfaction of, the plaintiff\u2019s claim. There are no words of such import. It was open to the defendant to show, if he could, that such was the fact; but this he has failed to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-3\">The receipt is, moreover, ambiguous. It is possible to construe it so that the part which follows the words \u201cfive hundred dollars \u201d may have been used to indicate the source from which the money came, and nothing more, being used by Mr. Wheeler for his own protection; and this would not perhaps be an unreasonable construction. At any rate, an element of uncertainty is introduced into it by the words \u201c per agreement,\u201d at the close. It is doubtful whether they refer to the amount named earlier in the receipt, or to the whole body of the receipt preceding them, as claimed by the defendant, or to the words \u201c memorial window to be put in said church,\u201d immediately before them. And there is nothing to show what the agreement was. It was therefore open to the parties to introduce paroi evidence of it, so that, if the receipt were to be held as a contract of the nature claimed by the defendant, the court was right in refusing the defendant\u2019s request. <em>Bard </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>3 Met. 74. <em>Hildreth </em>v. <em>O'Brien, </em>10 Allen, 104. <em>Stacy </em>v. <em>Kemp, </em>97 Mass. 166. <em>Stoops </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>100 Mass. 63. <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Lancashire &amp; Yorkshire Railway, </em>L. R. 6 Ch. 527.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">The view which we have taken of the main question at issue renders it unnecessary to consider the other points which have been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
