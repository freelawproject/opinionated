L. c. 278, \u00a7 28E, and Mass.R.Crim.P. 15(a)(2), 378 Mass. 882 [1979]) from a ruling allowing the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress a gun seized from the defendant by a police officer of the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA). The defendant was charged with carrying a gun without a license (G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10[a]) and with \u201caccosting or annoying\u201d a person of the opposite sex by offensive and disorderly acts and language (G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 53). A District Court judge first denied the motion to suppress and upheld the seizure of the gun under the \u201cstop and frisk\u201d rationale of <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1 (1968). On rehearing, however, he revoked his original ruling and allowed the motion on the ground that the statute establishing the MBTA police force, St. 1968, c. 664, does not give an MBTA officer authority to \u201cstop and frisk\u201d persons on premises not owned by the MBTA.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The issues raised in this appeal are whether the MBTA police officer had such authority and whether the seizure was warranted under <em>Terry </em>principles. In addition, the defendant filed a motion to dismiss in which he argued that the appeal was untimely.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We reject the defendant\u2019s contentions, rule that the judge erred in allowing the motion to suppress and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">1. <em>Motion to dismiss. </em>We first dispose of the defendant\u2019s claim that the appeal did not comply with the procedural <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>requirements of Mass.R.Crim.P. 15(a)(3)(B), 378 Mass. 883 (1979). Under that rule, the district attorney must in writing authorize the taking of an appeal \u201cwithin three days after the decision of the judge or within such other time as <em>the judge </em>may allow\u201d (emphasis supplied). The defendant claims that the words \u201cthe judge\u201d refer exclusively to the judge who allowed the motion to suppress and that, since a different judge allowed the Commonwealth to proceed with its appeal, the second judge\u2019s action is a nullity. The defendant does not urge that he was prejudiced by the judge\u2019s action but urges invalidity as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">The defendant\u2019s reading of rule 15 is contrary to the rules of construction contained in Mass.R.Crim.P. 2, 378 Mass. 844 (1979). Although rule 2 does not explicitly refer to definite or indefinite articles, similar matters are covered by specific portions of rule 2 which, by analogy, suggest that the word \u201cthe\u201d is not to be accorded crucial significance. See rule 2(a)(1), rule 2(b)(5) and rule 2(b)(9).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">More important, the general principles of construction set forth in rule 2(a) and in the Reporter\u2019s Notes preclude the defendant\u2019s wooden reading. Rule 2(a) states that the \u201crules . . . shall be construed to secure simplicity in procedure, fairness in administration, and the elimination of expense and delay.\u201d As indicated by the Reporter in his notes to rule 2, \u201c[T]he rules were not intended to be administered inflexibly. . . . Where a literal interpretation . . . would lead to unnecessary expense or delay . . . that interpretation is to yield to the principle enunciated in Rule 2(a).\u201d Rules of the Courts of the Commonwealth, Rules of Criminal Procedure at 6 (M.C.L.E. 1979). See also 1 Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure, \u00a7 \u00a7 31 and 32 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b795-7\">The defendant\u2019s interpretation would unquestionably lead to delay or expense. Under the current practice of assignment of judges, it would require seeking out the location <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>and schedule of the first judge,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and would thus complicate and unnecessarily delay the Commonwealth\u2019s right to seek review. Moreover, there is no reason intrinsic to rule 15 which suggests that the judge passing on a late authorization must be the same judge who decided the motion to suppress. Two other rules, Mass.R.Crim.P. 46(b), 378 Mass. 922 (1979), and Mass.R.A.P. 14(b), as amended, 378 Mass. 939 (1979), each of which provides for an alternative procedure in cognate cases, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dellicolli, post </em>909 (1980), permit enlargements of time by other judges. We see no purpose for a different result under rule 15 and, therefore, hold that the extension authorized by the second judge was valid.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">2. <em>Authority of MBTA police officers to arrest the defendant at the high school. </em>The events leading to the seizure of the gun and the arrest of the defendant are set forth in the judge\u2019s findings made prior to his original denial of the motion to suppress. On December 14, 1979, at approximately 8:00 a.m., a ninth grade student on her way to East Boston High School was approached by the defendant at the MBTA station at State Street, Boston. They engaged in small talk and both boarded the train. The student disembarked at Maverick Station and went to an MBTA bus stop to await a bus bound for the high school. She noticed the defendant standing beside her, and when she boarded the MBTA bus, he again followed her and sat next to her. He asked her if she would like to pose for photographs. She became apprehensive and refused. He stated he would pay her for posing and that she should have no concern because the photos would be distributed out of State. She became more fearful and again refused. When she alighted from the bus, the defendant followed her and repeated his sug<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>gesti\u00f3n that she pose for photographs. Upon their arrival at the White Street entrance of the school, the defendant stated that he was going to wait for her after school and that if she did not cooperate, he would harm her. The student informed the principal\u2019s office of the incident and was excused from school. The Boston police were notified and they, in turn, notified the MBTA police. A detective of the MBTA police arranged with the student to take her to East Boston High School that afternoon to locate and identify the defendant. The detective, another MBTA officer and the student drove by the White Street entrance of the high school in an unmarked car at 1:00 p.m., and the student pointed out the defendant. The two MBTA officers approached the defendant and, when the detective identified himself as a police officer, the defendant made a startled expression which caused the detective to become concerned for his safety. He conducted a pat down search of the defendant\u2019s outer garments and found a hand gun. He then arrested the defendant for carrying a gun without a license.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">The defendant argues that the MBTA officer had no authority to arrest him on premises not owned or controlled by the MBTA. This argument, however, ignores the plain language of St. 1968, c. 664, which authorizes the establishment of a police department by the MBTA. Section 1 of c. 664 states that \u201csuch police officers shall have, within the territorial limits of the authority,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the powers and duties conferred or imposed upon police officers of cities and towns\u201d under G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 98, and \u201cshall have the powers and duties which are conferred or imposed upon police officers\u201d of railroads, street railways and steamboats under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>G. L. c. 159, \u00a7 93. Although the powers and duties conferred on police officers under c. 159, \u00a7 93,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>are, for the most part, limited to the premises of transportation companies, there is no such limitation on the powers of police officers of cities and towns under c. 41, \u00a7 98. Since the statute explicitly confers upon the MBTA police the powers of both G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 98, <em>and </em>G. L. c. 159, \u00a7 93, we find no indication of a legislative intent to confine the authority of MBTA police to MBTA premises. To the contrary, St. 1968, c. 664, is a legislative statement that MBTA police officers are to have broader powers than railroad and other police officers governed by c. 159, \u00a7 93.\u00ae</p>\n<p id=\"b799-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>It is not unusual for transit police officers to have such broad authority,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and we note that there is no question here of conflicting jurisdiction as the Boston police initiated the MBTA investigation. We hold, therefore, that the MBTA police officers had authority to question and arrest the defendant at the East Boston High School, at least where, as here, the offense originated on MBTA property and related to the protection of an MBTA passenger.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">3. <em>Propriety of search and seizure. </em>The defendant also attempts to sustain the judge\u2019s suppression order on another ground, namely, that the \u201cstop and frisk\u201d of the defendant was in violation of the defendant\u2019s rights under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">At the original suppression hearing, the District Court judge ruled against the defendant on this issue. A threshold question is whether the defendant may raise this issue as he does not have a right to appeal a decision by a judge of the District Court determining a motion to suppress evidence. General Laws c. 278, \u00a7 28E, as appearing in St. 1979, c. 344, \u00a7 45. Mass.R.Crim.P. 15(a), 378 Mass. 882 (1979). We think the rule which permits an appellee who has not filed a cross appeal to rely on any ground which supports the judgment should be applicable. See <em>Alholm </em>v. <em>Wareham, </em>371 Mass. 621, 625 (1976). The Federal courts follow this procedure under the cognate statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3731 (1976), which provides that the government, but not the defendant, may take an interlocutory appeal from a decision on a motion to suppress evidence. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Moody, </em>485 F.2d 531, 534 (3d Cir. 1973). <em>United States </em>v. <em>Finn, </em>502 F.2d 938, 940 (7th Cir. 1974). <em>United States </em>v. <em>Swarovski, </em>557 F.2d 40, 49 (2d Cir. 1977), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 1045 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>(1978). This rule avoids \u201cthe possibility of continuing controversy over the same evidence,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Boswell, </em>374 Mass. 263, 267 (1978), and prevents multiple appeals concerning its admissibility. Accordingly, we hold that the defendant is entitled to raise the propriety of the search \u201cunder the umbrella of the government\u2019s appeal.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Moody, supra </em>at 534.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">The two requirements applicable to \u201cstop and frisk\u201d cases as set forth in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Silva, </em>366 Mass. 402, 405 (1974), are met in this case. First, \u201cthe initiation of the investigation by the police was permissible\u201d in view of the student\u2019s account of the incident and her identification of the defendant at the school. Second, the \u201cscope of the search was justified by the circumstances.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Silva, supra </em>at 405. The test for allowing a reasonable search for weapons as explained in <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>392 U.S. at 27, \u201cis whether a reasonably prudent man in the circumstances would be warranted in the belief that his safety or that of others was in danger.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Silva, supra </em>at 406. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Almeida, </em>373 Mass. 266, 271 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">As applied to the facts found by the motion judge, we think the police officer could well have believed that his safety or that of others was in danger. The defendant was identified by the student as a person who had followed her all the way from State Street station to East Boston High School, had told her that he would wait for her after school, and had threatened that he would harm her if she did not accede to his request. The student\u2019s story was confirmed by the facts. The defendant was, indeed, waiting for her after school. When the officer identified himself as a police officer, the defendant had an expression on his face which led the officer to fear for his safety. \u201c[I]n applying hindsight to the officer\u2019s actions, we think it crucial to remember, as shown by many tragic climaxes to threshold police inquiries, \u2018the answer might be a bullet.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Almeida, </em>373 Mass. at 271, quoting from <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, supra </em>at 33 (Harlan, J., concurring). The facts warrant the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>elusion that, in making his split-second decision, the police officer could reasonably have feared for his safety or could reasonably have believed that the defendant might attempt to escape using arms. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Anderson, 366 Mass. 394, 400 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">Since no legal grounds for supporting the decision of the motion judge have been shown, the order of suppression is reversed, and, as indicated in part 1, <em>supra, </em>the motion to dismiss is denied. The matter is remanded to the District Court for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">So <em>ordered.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b794-7\"> Although no findings or reasons were given by the judge in connection with his ruling on rehearing, the defendant\u2019s motion for rehearing stated as its sole ground that \u201cthe defendant wishes to submit additional evidence relative to the authority and police powers of the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority police officers.\u201d The briefs of both parties assume that the judge\u2019s ruling was based on that ground.

L. c. 159, \u00a7 93, as last amended by St. 1976, c. 380, provides: \u201cRailroad ... or steamboat police officers may preserve order on the premises, cars, vehicles, vessels and boats of the corporation or company upon whose petition they are appointed . . . may, without a warrant, arrest an idle, noisy, or disorderly person upon such premises, cars, vehicles, vessels or boats; or a passenger upon such cars, vehicles, vessels or boats who refuses to pay his fare . . . may, without a warrant, arrest any person committing any of the offences specified in section one hundred and four; and railway police officers may, without a warrant, arrest any person committing any of the offences specified in section ninety-four of chapter one hundred sixty-one.

As indicated in an MBTA report, before 1968, protection was provided by a special unit of the Boston police department paid for by the MBTA. Special Report of the MBTA, pursuant to c. 2 and 9, Resolves of 1977, Relative to Police Protection in the Authority\u2019s Rapid Transit Stations, at 1 (1977) (Report). See also 1980 House Doc. 5955, at 33. These officers were assigned by the Boston police department and apparently were not appointed pursuant to G. L. c. 22, \u00a7 9L. Therefore, they would not have been limited to the powers set forth in G. L. c. 159, \u00a7 93. We also note that the defendant\u2019s position would prevent the MBTA police from using patrol cars to provide protection for buses and would preclude other off premises practices of MBTA police officers current at the time of the report.
