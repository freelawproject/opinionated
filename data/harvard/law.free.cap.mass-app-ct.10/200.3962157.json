L. c. 71, \u00a7\u00a7 38G and 38H), from a judgment entered in the Superior Court in favor of the defendant school committee on his complaint for a declaratory judgment under G. L. c. 231A. The principal question presented for consideration is whether the plaintiff had acquired tenure at discretion under the provisions of G. L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>c. 71, \u00a7 38H,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> inserted by St. 1965, c. 276, and \u00a7 41,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> as amended through St. 1973, c. 847, \u00a7 6, at the time the school committee informed him that his position for the 1979-1980 school year had been abolished pursuant to a district-wide reorganization plan. If the plaintiff had acquired such tenure, the committee could dismiss him only by complying with the procedural requirements of G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> as amended through St. 1972, c. 464, \u00a7 2, which were not observed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Nutter </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Lowell, </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. 77, 79-82 (1977). The judge entered a declaration that \u201cthe plaintiff had not acquired tenure at discretion under G. L. c. 71, \u00a741, and [his] employment terminated [on] March 20, 1979.\u201d We affirm that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">The parties stipulated facts which are dispositive of the question. The plaintiff was first employed as a high school librarian by the committee on October 8, 1975. The teachers had begun work at the high school on September 8, 1975; because of delays in the construction of and renovations to the high school building, however, the students did not start classes until September 29, 1975. (That same school year, the junior high school teachers began work on September 2, and their students commenced classes on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>September 3.) During the school year 1975-1976, the high school teachers worked and were paid on the basis of 182 days, while the students attended school for 165 days. That year the plaintiff, who began work on October 8, worked a total of 160 days; his salary was pro-rated on the basis of working 160 out of 182 days. G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 40, as amended through St. 1973, c. 52, \u00a7 15.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> He was thereafter employed by the committee during the full school years for 1976-1977, 1977-1978, and 1978-1979. During his final year the title of his position was changed from that of high school librarian to \u201cinstruction-media center director,\u201d but his job description and substantive duties remained the same. During that year, on March 20, 1979, the plaintiff was notified by the committee that commencing with the 1979-1980 school year, his position and a similar one at the junior high school would be consolidated into the single position of \u201cdistrict coordinator of instructional media centers,\u201d and that both former positions consequently would be abolished.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">To acquire tenure, the plaintiff had to have served in the public schools \u201cfor the three previous consecutive school years.\u201d G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 41. The crucial year for determining the plaintiff\u2019s entitlement to tenure is the 1975-1976 school year, when he served in the position of a high school librarian for 160 out of the 182 days that the high school was open and his salary was pro-rated accordingly. There is no question that he rendered professional services of a substantial character to the school district (see <em>Frye </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Leicester, </em>300 Mass. 537, 540 [1938]), on a \u201cregular and continuous\u201d basis <em>(Nester </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Fall River, </em>318 Mass. 538, 542-543 [1945]), during that school year. However, in addition to these requirements, in order to acquire tenure he must establish that his service in the 1975-1976 school year was provided \u201cfor the entire period\u201d <em>(Frye </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Leicester, </em>300 Mass. at 540), or, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>as it is sometimes phrased, for \u201cthe period comprising a normal school year.\u201d <em>Nester </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Fall River, </em>318 Mass. at 542. The plaintiff contends that the term \u201cschool year\u201d as used in \u00a7 41 to calculate tenure is restricted to that period of time during the year when the public school teachers are engaged in actually teaching the students, i.e., in this instance, 165 days rather than the 182 days the high school was open and the teachers were required to be present. We do not accept that contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">The term \u201cschool year\u201d is not defined in G. L. c. 71 although it appears in several sections of the statute. See, e.g., G. L. c. 71, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 4, 4A, 18, 21, 37B, 38G, 40 and 41. Since there is nothing in the context of any of these sections which indicates that the term has a different meaning within different sections of the same act, it is reasonable to assume that the term is intended to have the same meaning throughout. 2A Sands, Sutherland Statutory Construction \u00a7 51.02 (4th ed. 1973). The term is used in c. 71, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 4, and 4A, to refer to the time period in a particular school system (after the State Board of Education has determined the <em>minimum </em>number of days) during which the schools must be kept open; in \u00a7 40, to set the period when the teachers\u2019 salaries are deemed earned (\u201cfully earned at the end of the school year, and proportionately earned during the school year\u201d); in \u00a7 41, to establish the period of service necessary in the ordinary case to acquire tenure (\u201cthree previous consecutive school years\u201d) and the date by which a probationary teacher must be notified of the nonrenewal of his or her contract (on or before April 15 \u201cwhenever such person is not to be employed for the following school year\u201d). None of the foregoing sections of the statute, or any of the other sections of c. 71 where the term appears (without laboriously parsing each one), supports the notion that the school year encompasses only the period when actual teaching occurs. Section 40 makes it plain that the teachers\u2019 rights to a salary are based upon the satisfactory performance of a contract for services over the entire school year considered as a definite period of time; when read in con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>junction with \u00a7 40, then, \u201cschool year\u201d in \u00a7 41 must be read as meaning the entire school year for purposes of determining tenure rights. The services include both teaching and nonteaching duties,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and the period is the same for all the teachers in the system, irrespective of peculiar conditions prevailing at one school. We hold that the term school year, in so far as it applies to full-time teachers, teachers rendering regular part-time service <em>(Ryan </em>v. <em>Superintendent of Schs. of Quincy, </em>363 Mass. 731, 738-739 1973]),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and other school personnel subject to the tenure provisions of \u00a7 41, is the period during which the teachers in the particular system are obligated by their contract(s) of employment with the school committee to render services in the public schools, in both teaching and nonteaching capacities.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Typically, this will be a minimum of 180 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>days;<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> in the case of the defendant school district in the 1975-1976 school year it was 182 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">The cases that have dealt with this aspect of tenure have implicitly based their holdings on this view of the statute. In <em>Frye </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Leicester, </em>300 Mass. at 540, a teacher was held to have attained tenure who had been continuously employed \u201cfor the entire period,\u201d between September and June, of the three previous consecutive school years. In <em>Nester </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Fall River, </em>318 Mass. at 542-543, the \u201cnormal school year\u201d was said to be 180 days, and the claims by three teachers that they had acquired tenure were rejected because in one year they had served only approximately one half the period comprising a normal school year. In <em>Ryan </em>v. <em>Superintendent of Schs. of Quincy, </em>363 Mass, at 736-737, the teacher was held to have acquired tenure based on eleven consecutive years of regular part-time service between September and June. <em>Brodie </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Easton, </em>3 Mass. App. Ct. 141, 143 (1975), held that the plaintiff\u2019s 136 days of service in one year was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>considerably less than the period comprising a normal school year and that he was therefore not entitled to tenure. In <em>Woodward </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Sharon, </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. 84, 88 (1977), the court considered \u201cthe fact that the plaintiff [had] worked 181 of the 182 school days of the [school] year\u201d as indicative of regular and continuous service for one of the three years required. Minor deviations from the norm are permitted by the cases (see, e.g., <em>Nester, </em>318 Mass. at 542-543 [two days]; <em>Woodward, </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. at 88 [one day]); and absences which are excused or sanctioned by the contract or by the school committee would not weigh against the teacher\u2019s entitlement to tenure. The only other recent case revealed by our search is <em>Brophy </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Worcester, </em>6 Mass. App. Ct. 731, 733, 736 (1978), in which the question of service by the teachers for the entire school year was not raised by the committee. The plaintiff\u2019s reliance on the <em>Frye </em>and <em>Ryan </em>decisions, <em>supra, </em>for the proposition that actual teaching time should be used in calculating the school year is thus misplaced. Both cases deal with the distinction between regular part-time service (which qualifies towards tenure) and irregular intermittent service (which does not); both cases, moreover, point out explicitly that the teachers\u2019 service had been \u201cfor the entire period\u201d <em>(Frye, </em>300 Mass. at 540), or over the \u201centire school year\u201d <em>(Ryan, </em>363 Mass. at 738, 739 &amp; n.2). Additionally, the <em>Ryan </em>decision rejected the use of annual one-year contracts and termination notices at the end of every year during and after the tenure year as a device to circumvent the rights conferred by \u00a7 41.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 740.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">For these reasons it follows that the plaintiff\u2019s service in the 1975-1976 school year occupied \u201ca substantial period of time in [that year], but it was considerably less than the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>period comprising a normal school year and does not in our opinion constitute the regular and continuous employment that the statute contemplates.\u201d <em>Nester </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Fall River, </em>318 Mass. at 542. <em>Brodie </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Easton, </em>3 Mass.

G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 40. Clearly he would not contend that for salary purposes the school year ended two days earlier when the students completed classes, since such a conclusion would have required him to donate two days of service without pay to the school committee. Similarly, the beginning of the school year had to be the first day the teachers worked, and not the first day of student attendance, so that a teacher who left the system before completion of the year would be entitled to salary for those days. Moreover, the plaintiff\u2019s approach would require the school committee to treat him differently from the junior high school librarian for purposes of tenure, because the students attended classes at the junior high school for more days than the high school students, and because the hours served per day or week are not relevant for tenure purposes. See <em>Ryan </em>v. <em>Superintendent of Schs. of Quincy, </em>363 Mass. at 738-739.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b223-6\"> Despite the reorganization of the Department of Education in 1965 by St. 1965, c. 572, which provided that schools are now to be kept open the number of days required by the Board of Education (see G. L. c. 15, \u00a7 1G, inserted by St. 1965, c. 572, \u00a7 2, stating that \u201c[tjhe board shall establish the minimum length for a school day and the minimum number of days in the school year\u201d), it was not intended thereby to shorten the number of days in a normal school year. See Report of the Special Commission Established to Make an Investigation and Study Relative to Improving and Extending Educational Facilities in the Commonwealth, 1965 House Doc. 3300, at 33 (1965) (recommending that the board establish a school year of 185 days, while also recommending the amendment in the form in which it now appears). The 180 days previously specified by statute (see G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 4A, as in effect prior to amendment by St. 1965, c. 572, \u00a7 16, which required schools to be open for 180 days) remains the normal minimum period for a school year. See 603 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 27.01 (1978), which provides that \u201c[a]ll school districts shall schedule a minimum of 180 days per year,\u201d while allowing student attendance to be calculated either upon this figure or upon an hourly figure which varies for elementary, secondary, or vocational schools. See also G.
