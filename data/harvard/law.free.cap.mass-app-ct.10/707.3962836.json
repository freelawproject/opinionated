L. c. 269, \u00a7 10(a). He has raised the sole issue \u201c[w]hether the judge\u2019s striking of the entire testimony of the only defense witness to have contradicted the police version of the incident denied defendant his constitutional right to present a defense.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b725-13\">There was evidence at trial from prosecution witnesses that on January 8, 1978, two police officers observed an automobile stopping at a sidewalk in Charlestown and saw three occupants alight. The defendant emerged from the back seat, one Somers from the front passenger\u2019s seat, and one Houlihan from the driver\u2019s seat. Each of the men was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>known to at least one of the two police officers. All three men were patted down, and the defendant and Somers were found to have handguns on them. Houlihan was unarmed. The defendant and Somers were arrested; Houlihan was not.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Subsequently, the car was searched, but nothing of concern to the police was found.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">Somers was the only witness for the defense to contradict the police testimony. He testified that the police had not found guns on the defendant or on him but had found them under the front seat of the car when they had searched it. He stated that the police had searched the car after he and the defendant had been handcuffed and put in the police cruiser. Somers further testified that one of the police officers said, \u201cI found two\u201d, and held up the guns, that he (Somers) responded, \u201cThose are not our pistols,\u201d and that the officer said, \u201cThey are now.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">During direct examination by the defendant\u2019s counsel, Somers was asked, \u201cWho was driving the car?\u201d Somers then went on to state in answering further questions that he had met the driver briefly, that he did not know him very well, and that he had seen him only twice before. Under cross-examination he reiterated the foregoing, indicating also that he had met the driver \u201c[t]hat evening and a couple evenings before that.\u201d After answering questions as to his address on January 8, he was asked by the prosecutor, \u201cWhere had you been since 1973?\u201d Somers responded: \u201cCan I speak to Your Honor out of the earshot of the jury?\u201d which prompted the judge to call counsel to a bench conference. We set out the pertinent parts of what followed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ayf\">Prosecuting attorney: \u201cI am interested in . . . establishing bias on behalf of his friend and also I am trying to establish he knew very well who John Houlihan was. They are friends. And I can establish that they lived together.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AZK\">The judge: \u201cThat they lived together? That he knew Houlihan before he said that he knew him? He says he only met him at the bar.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>Prosecuting attorney: \u201cI know. My information is that they were doing time at the same place. I prosecuted John Houlihan so I know he was in a correctional institute.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AYU\">The judge: \u201cWell, was he with this fellow \u2014\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aay\">Prosecuting attorney: \u201cThat is what \u2014 I know that he was at M.C.I. Norfolk and this guy is charged with escape from M.C.I. Norfolk. And my police officer tells me that they were definitely there together.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-5\">The judge: \u201cWell, if you have got evidence to support it, I suppose it is by way of impeachment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-6\">Attorney for defendant: \u201cI am in a difficult position because naturally he can be impeached. I cannot question that.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-7\">The judge: \u201cI think if the fellow says, T met him at a bar\u2019 and you ask: \u2018Weren\u2019t you two down at a correctional facility together,\u2019 and he says \u2018yes,\u2019 that shows him to be a bit of a problem. If he says \u2018no,\u2019 he is going to have to have evidence of the same. I am afraid that under these conditions it is a problem.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-8\">Attorney for defendant: \u201cI would tend to agree. I cannot answer for him. I only spoke to him briefly at the noon recess. He is concerned with his records of convictions coming out.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-9\">The judge: \u201cHe knew about his privilege because he exercised it yesterday. His counsel knew he was to be \u2014\u201d Prosecuting attorney: \u201cFor the record [the attorney for Somers] was here during the break.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-10\">The judge: \u201cIn any event I do not see a problem there, and I think for Houlihan that he can pursue it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-11\">Attorney for defendant: \u201cI agree.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-12\">(End of Bench Conference)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-13\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-14\">Prosecuting attorney: \u201cWhere were you living in December of 1977?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-16\">Mr. Somers: \u201cYour Honor, I\u2019d like to speak to your Honor on that question.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-17\">The judge: \u201cWell, the question is a simple one. It says, Where were you living \u2014\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>Mr. Somers: (speaking to judge)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-5\">The judge: \u201cYou have had counsel here . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-6\">Mr. Somers: \u201cI\u2019d like to have my counsel here before I answer that question.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-7\">The judge: \u201cYou may have the question.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-8\">Prosecuting attorney: \u201cYour answer to the question, please?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-9\">Mr. Somers: \u201cYour Honor, I\u2019d like to have my counsel here before I answer that.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-10\">The judge: \u201cI appreciate that, but I will direct you to answer it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-11\">Mr. Somers: \u201cI\u2019ll take the Fifth Amendment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-12\">The judge: \u201cAll right, you may do so, but still I cannot let you testify and you cannot testify \u2014 begin to answer questions and then elect to take the Fifth Amendment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b728-14\">A colloquy followed. Somers continued to claim the protection of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The judge informed him that his record of conviction as well as any inconsistencies between his testimony given at the present trial and his testimony given at his upcoming trial could be used against him at his trial.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-15\">The judge: \u201cI think what I am trying to tell you is that I think you may be putting yourself in a very uncomfortable position in a matter which is really of no consequence. In other words, I have no doubt in my own mind, and I say this for the record, but also for the benefit \u2014 I have no doubt that it is within the province of the law as it presently exists for me to order you to answer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-16\">Mr. Somers: \u201cI realize that.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-17\">The judge: \u201cAnd upon your failure to answer, I will have to give you six months in the house of correction after you finish whatever sentence you serve.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-18\">The judge persisted in his attempts to have the witness answer the question voluntarily. The following occurred: The judge: \u201cThat is why I am telling you I think you are risking six months unnecessarily.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-19\">Mr. Somers: \u201cI will cite the Fifth Amendment if the Court orders me to answer the question. I\u2019ll do it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>The judge: \u201cI will order you to do it. You put it again and bring the jury down.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-5\">(Jury present)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-6\">Prosecuting attorney: \u201cMr. Somers, where were you living in December of 1977?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-7\">Mr. Somers: (No response).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-8\">The judge: \u201cI now direct you to answer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-9\">Mr. Somers: \u201cYour Honor, I refuse to answer on the grounds of the Fifth Amendment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-10\">The judge: \u201cNow I direct you to answer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-11\">Mr. Somers: \u201cI refuse to answer on the grounds my answer may tend to incriminate me, Your Honor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-12\">The judge: \u201cAll right. I will see counsel over here.\u201d (Bench Conference)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-13\">The judge: \u201cI think he had a change of mind. I do not think he misunderstands. I move to strike all his testimony and tell them to utterly disregard it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-14\">Attorney for defendant: \u201cYour Honor, I have to object to that.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-15\">The judge: \u201cThat is the purpose of giving you an opportunity to.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-16\">Prosecuting attorney: \u201cYour Honor, I think that would leave me in somewhat of a tenable [sic] position even though it is stricken before the legal record. The jury has it before their minds, and I would like to continue with the impeachment part. I would ask that he be cited for contempt.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b729-18\">There followed further discussion of contempt in the course of which defense counsel stated that he did not want to lose \u201cthis man\u2019s testimony.\u201d The bench conference ended, and the witness was questioned as to prior convictions. He refused to answer any of the questions, citing the Fifth Amendment. The witness\u2019s lawyer, who had been called earlier, arrived and was briefed on what had happened. The lawyer talked in private with the witness, after which the witness informed the court that he would not answer the questions. The judge sentenced the witness to \u201csix months <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>in the House of Correction Suffolk County, said sentence to be served from and after any sentence\u201d then being served. The judge then recalled the jury and instructed them that they were to disregard all of Somers\u2019 testimony. The defendant objected, and his exception was noted.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">When a witness refuses to answer particular questions on cross-examination, his testimony may be struck unless the questions go to collateral matters. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Cardillo, </em>316 F.2d 606, 611 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 375 U.S. 822 (1963). The Supreme Judicial Court recognized <em>Cardillo </em>as the leading case on this issue in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Funches, </em>379 Mass. 283, 293 (1979). <em>Cardillo </em>stated three categories to be considered in determining whether to strike all or part of a witness\u2019s testimony or take other remedial action because of unanswered questions asked a witness on cross-examination.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Although the <em>Cardillo </em>decision deals with the trial court\u2019s failure to strike all or part of a prosecution witness\u2019s testimony because of the refusal of the witness to answer questions on cross-examination, the decisions called to our attention and those we have found which have considered the refusal of a defense witness to answer questions on cross-examination have adopted the <em>Cardillo </em>analysis. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Frank, </em>520 F.2d 1287, 1292 (2d Cir. 1975), cert. denied, 423 U.S. 1087 (1976); <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>549 S.W. 2d 336, 342-343 (Mo. 1977); <em>State </em>v. <em>Monsoor, </em>56 Wis.2d 689, 701 (1973), habeas corpus granted sub nom. <em>Wisconsin ex rel. Monsoor </em>v. <em>Gagnon, </em>497 F.2d 1126 (7th Cir. 1974); <em>Peters </em>v. <em>State, </em>70 Wis. 2d 22, 35-37 (1975); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number><em>State </em>v. <em>Roller, 87 </em>Wis. 2d 253, 283 (1979); <em>Ryan </em>v. <em>State, </em>95 Wis. 2d 83, 90 (Ct. App. 1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">The present questions fall into the third of the Cardillo categories. The Commonwealth\u2019s purpose<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> in asking these questions was to establish that Somers had lied about the length of his acquaintance with the driver of the car. Since the relationship of the witness and driver had no relevance to the defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence, the effort to prove Somers had lied about it was an attack on his general credibility. As such, it was collateral. Contrast <em>Peters, supra </em>at 37-38; <em>Cardillo, supra </em>at 612-613. See also 3A Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7\u00a7 1003-1006 (Chadbourn rev. 1970). See also <em>Funches, supra </em>at 293. Although it does not appear that the judge\u2019s action was occasioned by the witness\u2019s refusal to testify concerning his prior convictions, evidence of such convictions would also have been collateral. <em>Cardillo, supra </em>at 611. Refusal by a witness on cross-examination to answer questions related to collateral matters is not ground for striking the witness\u2019s testimony. <em>Cardillo, supra </em>at 611. <em>Brown, supra </em>at 342.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">Previous applications of the Cardillo guidelines in factual patterns such as the present one are consistent with this determination. In <em>Roller, supra, </em>and <em>Ryan, supra, </em>striking the defense witness\u2019s testimony was held proper because the witness, by refusing to answer, avoided cross-examination on any probative issues. <em>Frank, supra </em>and <em>Peters, supra, </em>each involved a witness who refused to answer questions on cross-examination that specifically tested the credibility of his account of the crime. The striking of their testimony was upheld. <em>Monsoor, supra, </em>and <em>Brown, supra, </em>held the striking of the defense witness\u2019s testimony to be error. In both, the disputed questions involved, as does the case before us, inquiries into collateral matters to assault the witness\u2019s general credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>In the circumstances of the present case, the order was not warranted. The prosecutor was not without other equally effective measures to attack Somers\u2019 credibility. He could have attacked Somers\u2019 general credibility simply on the basis of his previous convictions through witnesses other than Somers. The prosecutor knew the name of the driver and knew when and where he and Somers had been in prison. The prison records could easily have been ordered into court. Also, a police witness had informed the prosecutor that Houlihan and Somers were in M.C.I. Norfolk together. The judge in his charge could have dealt with the witness\u2019s refusal to answer rather than employing the Draconian means of striking what, if believed by the jury, would have been a complete defense. We hold that it was error to have done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">The Commonwealth properly makes no suggestion that the error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b732-7\">\n<em>Verdict set aside.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b725-14\"> See <em>Washington </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>388 U.S. 14, 19 (1967); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Francis, </em>375 Mass. 211, 213-214, cert. denied 439 U.S. 872 (1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b726-7\"> There is no question that the acts of the officers were warranted on the basis of information that they possessed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b730-6\"> The court stated (316 F.2d at 613) that: \u201cThere would appear to be at least three categories to be considered.

The second would be a situation in which the subject matter of the testimony was connected solely with one phase of the case in which event a partial striking might suffice. The third would involve collateral matters or cumulative testimony concerning credibility which would not require a direction to strike and which could be handled (in a jury case) by the judge\u2019s charge if questions as to the weight to be ascribed to such testimony arose.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b731-7\"> The Cardillo court examined each question in terms of \u201cthe purpose of the inquiry and the role which the answer if given, might have played in the defense.\u201d <em>Cardillo, supra </em>at 612.
