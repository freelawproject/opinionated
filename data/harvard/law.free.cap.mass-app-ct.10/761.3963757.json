While still abed, Lapidus developed his \u201cLapidus Airfloat System\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>obtained the occasional collaboration of the plaintiff Barry Wood, who was a social and business friend. This case concerns Wood\u2019s share in the corporation, Roy Lapidus, Inc. (the corporation), which Lapidus had earlier organized and which came to manufacture and sell the Airfloat System.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">From the trial judge\u2019s findings of fact we also learn that on November 30, 1967, Lapidus filed an application for a patent on the Airfloat System and that the United States Patent Office ultimately issued to him Patent No. 3,653,083 for his device. Wood was not involved in the actual invention of the Airfloat System and did not contribute to obtaining the patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">During the development and production phase, however, Wood spent an average of ten hours per week on the construction and assembly of the Airfloat System. In due course Lapidus offered Wood a piece of the business. On May 27, 1968, Lapidus authored and delivered to Wood a letter (the full text of which is set out in the margin)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> setting forth the terms on which Wood might acquire stock in the corporation. Whatever merits that letter had in the way of brevity were overshadowed by its demonstrable ambiguity. The letter acknowledged receipt of $2,500 toward acquisition of a five percent interest in \u201cmy medical aids equip<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>ment business.\u201d An additional $2,500 was to be paid within six months, whereupon Wood was to have \u201cfull ownership, free of any encumbrances\u201d and one Harold S. White, a lawyer (presumably acting for Lapidus), was to issue to Wood five percent of the stock \u201cof the corporation that is to run the medical aides [sic] equipment business.\u201d The last paragraph of the letter, however, says that the \u201ccomplete\u201d price for the five percent interest is \u201creally the sum of $12,000\u201d to be paid \u201cout of any and all income\u201d that Wood received from \u201cthis business.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">Wood paid the second instalment of $2,500 but never received a stock certificate. He never paid the remaining $7,000. In 1976, the corporation was sold for a figure, net after taxes, of $900,000.\u00ae The trial judge found that Wood was vested with a five percent interest in the corporation, that Lapidus and the corporation had waived payment of the $7,000 which was the balance of the purchase price, and that Wood was entitled to $45,000.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">On their appeal, the defendants urge two points: (1) that Wood\u2019s interest in the corporation was conditioned on his paying the full purchase price; and (2) that the judge erred in finding that Lapidus\u2019 waiver of the payment of the additional $7,000 was supported by consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-7\">1. <em>The Status of the $7,000 Obligation.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b781-8\">Whether the letter of May 27,1968, outlining the terms on which Wood might buy into the corporation expressed the obligation to pay an additional $7,000 as a condition precedent,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>a condition subsequent,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> or an independent obligation requires ascertaining the intent of the parties as expressed in the instrument. <em>Gardiner </em>v. <em>Corson, </em>15 Mass. 500, 503 (1819). To that end, a court considers the words used, see <em>MacDonald </em>v. <em>Gough, </em>326 Mass. 93, 96 (1950); the document taken as a whole, <em>King Features Syndicate, Inc. </em>v. <em>Cape Cod Bdcst. Co., 317 </em>Mass. 652, 654 (1945); <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Worcester Business Dev. Corp., 1 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 527, 529 (1973); and surrounding facts, <em>Robert Indus., Inc. </em>v. <em>Spence, </em>362 Mass. 751, 755 (1973). See <em>Fay, Spofford &amp; Thorndike, Inc. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Port Authy., </em>7 Mass. App. Ct. 336, 341-342 (1979). We agree with the trial judge\u2019s conclusion that the language in the second paragraph of the May 27, 1968, letter, which speaks of Wood having \u201cfull ownership, free of any encumbrances\u201d upon payment of the second instalment of $2,500, negates the notion that Wood\u2019s ownership of the stock was conditional. The obligation to pay the additional $7,000 was an independent one. There was also evidence to which the judge could give weight that Lapidus had frequently referred to Wood as a stockholder. <em>Pittsfield &amp; No. Adams R.R. </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Albany R.R., </em>260 Mass. 390, 398 (1927). Parol evidence, of course, was admissible in aid of construing an ambiguous written instrument. <em>Id. LaCouture </em>v. <em>Renaud, </em>325 Mass. 33, 36-37 (1949). If there were any residual doubts on this score, they would be resolved against the defendants by application of the principle that a written instrument is construed strongly against the party who drew it if ambiguous or uncertain language is used. <em>Bowser </em>v. <em>Chalifour, </em>334 Mass. 348, 352 (1956). It was of no consequence that the corporation never issued and delivered to Wood any stock certificates. <em>Atlantic Transp. Co. </em>v. <em>Alexander Shipping Co., </em>261 Mass. 1, 11 (1927). <em>Sarnia </em>v. <em>Central Oil Co., </em>339 Mass. 101, 110 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b783-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>The defendants urge, however, that construction of the May 27, 1968, letter was not open to the court because the plaintiff in his complaint had made a judicial admission that he would receive his five percent interest in the business upon payment of the total $12,000. A judicial admission is a proposition of fact in the form of acts or declarations during the course of judicial proceedings which conclusively determine an issue. Leach &amp; Liacos, Massachusetts Evidence 14-15 (4th ed. 1967). 9 Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 2588, at 586 (1940). Allegations in pleadings may constitute judicial admissions, G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 87, but only if they are allegations of fact. <em>Wasserman </em>v. <em>Tonelli, </em>343 Mass. 253, 257 (1961). Leach &amp; Liacos, <em>supra </em>at 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">It does not appear that the significance which the defendants seek to attach to the seventh paragraph of the complaint<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> was called to the attention of the trial judge. We, therefore, need not consider the question, <em>Gerber </em>v. <em>TyData, Inc., </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. 898, 898-899 (1977), although we observe in passing that, fairly construed, the statements in the complaint as to the effect of the written agreement between the parties were conclusions of law rather than allegations of fact. See <em>Wasserman </em>v. <em>Tonelli, </em>343 Mass. at 257; <em>Steranko </em>v. <em>Inforex, Inc., </em>8 Mass. App. Ct. 523, 527-528 (1979) (court fairly construes pleadings). See also Mass.R.Civ.P. 8(f), 365 Mass. 751 (1974) (pleadings to be construed to do substantial justice).</p>\n<p id=\"b784-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>2. <em>Waiver of the $7,000 Payment.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">There was evidence that Lapidus had raised with Wood the matter of the balance of the $7,000 due for his interest in the corporation and that Lapidus had expressly waived payment of the additional amount. To the extent that the waiver by Lapidus was gratuitous, it would not bind him or the corporation. Wood\u2019s services to the defendants before the waiver would riot support a binding promise. <em>Conant </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>202 Mass. 34, 38 (1909). <em>Field </em>v. <em>Hamm, </em>254 Mass. 268, 270 (1926). The judge found consideration for the waiver by Lapidus of the $7,000, in Wood\u2019s continuing to work for the corporation notwithstanding that he was not contractually bound so to do. See <em>Balkin </em>v. <em>Frank M. Katz, Inc., </em>373 Mass. 419, 421 (1977). The record, however, is devoid of anything which supports a finding that there was an understanding that Wood would continue in his employment in exchange for waiver of the $7,000 payment. Indeed, so much of the record as touches on any understanding negates the conclusion that one existed. The subject came up during cross-examination of Wood, the pertinent portion of which was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-6\">\u201c[Defendant\u2019s Counsel:]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-8\">Wood:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-9\">Q. And at the time, did Roy ask anything of you so that he would forgive the $7,000.00?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-10\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-11\">Q. He didn\u2019t ask you to promise that you continue working for any particular period of time in the future at any particular wage or any other such agreement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-12\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-13\">Q. And prior to the $7,000.00 he hadn\u2019t said anything of that sort to you in order for him to forgive the $7,000.00, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-14\">A. Correct.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b785-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>Nor was there any showing, as there must have been under our case law, \u201cthat the continued employment [was] in reliance on the promised benefit.\u201d <em>Balkin </em>v. <em>Frank M. Katz, Inc., </em>373 Mass. at 422. The finding, therefore, that Wood continued to work for the corporation in consideration of the waiver and forgiveness of the $7,000 payment was clearly erroneous. Mass.R.Civ.P. 52(a), 365 Mass. 816 (1974). Accordingly, Wood\u2019s recovery must be reduced by $7,000, the amount due to the corporation for the balance of Wood\u2019s stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">The judgment is to be modified by substituting the figure $38,000 for the figure $45,000 in the first and second paragraphs thereof and, as so modified, is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b780-7\"> \u201cThis is to acknowledge receipt of Two thousand Five hundred Dollars ($2,500.00) by check, from you towards the purchase of 5 % of my medical aids equipment business.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-8\">\u201cI also acknowledge that Two Thousand Five Hundred ($2,500.00) more is coming toward your having full ownership, free of any encumbrances of 5 % of the above business which is currently a division of Roy Lapidus, Inc. and it is understood that attorney Harold S.

White to return the 100 shares of U. S. Industries Common Stock to you and that which time I will also instruct Harold S. White to issue to you 5 % of the stock of the corporation that is to run the medical aides [sic] equipment business.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-10\">\u201cIt is also understood that the complete purchase price for the 5% interest is really the sum of $12,000.00 and you are to give to me out of any and all income that you receive from this business, the first $7,000.00 in order to get to the total original purchase price of $12,000.00.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b781-9\"> The corporation did not own the Airfloat System patent; Lapidus had retained the patent and licensed it to the corporation, rather than assigning it. The judge found Wood was not entitled to any income from the sale of the Airfloat System patent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b781-10\"> The trial judge found that the corporation did own a later patent, referred to as the Venapressor patent, and provided in the judgment that Wood was to recover five percent of any income attributable to the Venapressor patent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b781-11\"> A condition precedent is an act which must occur before performance by the other party is due. <em>Malden Knitting Mills </em>v. <em>United States Rubber Co., </em>301 Mass. 229, 233 (1938).

There is little support in the record for this contention and none for the implication that the issue of a judicial admission was raised with the trial judge.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
