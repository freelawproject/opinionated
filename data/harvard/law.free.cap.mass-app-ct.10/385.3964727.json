L. c. 119, \u00a7 61, a District Court judge ordered the issuance of a criminal complaint against the fourteen year old defendant and ordered him bound over to the Superior Court for trial as an adult. The defendant was subsequently convicted on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>indictments charging him with operating a motor vehicle negligently so that the lives or safety of the public might be endangered (G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24[2][c]) and with using a motor vehicle without authority, knowing that such use is unauthorized (G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24[2][a]).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">In this appeal from those convictions he challenges the process by which he was transferred from the juvenile system to the Superior Court to be handled there as if he were an adult, on a number of grounds: (1) that neither of the alleged offenses with which he was charged was an offense \u201cinvolving the infliction or threat of serious bodily harm\u201d as required by G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 61, as appearing in St. 1975, c. 840, \u00a7 1; (2) that if the language of \u00a7 61 is interpreted to include the offenses with which he was charged, such an interpretation would be such an unforeseeable departure from precedent as to violate his rights to due process under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution; and (3) that the District Court judge\u2019s findings, which included only one subsidiary finding, were deficient. We agree with the defendant\u2019s third contention, but not with his other two.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">The matter comes to us on a statement of proceedings<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> pursuant to M.R.A.P. 8(c), as amended, 378 Mass. 933 (1979). The reference to the transfer hearing is sparse and states merely that \u201cOn February 21,1978, after a hearing, the Court. . . ordered the juvenile complaints dismissed and adult complaints to issue.\u201d The order of the District Court is reproduced in the margin<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and is on Uniform Form DCM-12, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>prescribed by District Municipal Courts Special Rule 208 (1976). The material italicized in note 2 is in the judge\u2019s handwriting; the remainder is the official form.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">After he was indicted, the defendant moved in the Superior Court for dismissal of the indictments on a number of grounds, including those now argued on appeal. A judge sitting in the Superior Court denied the motions and ruled \u201cas a matter of law\u201d **<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> that the District Court\u2019s transfer order was sufficient on its face to meet the requirements of c. 119, \u00a7 61. He also ruled that the offense of operating negligent<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>ly, so that the lives or safety of the public might be endangered, is a transferable offense as it is one involving \u201cthe infliction or threat of serious bodily harm\u201d within the meaning of G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 61.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On the same date as his motions to dismiss were denied, the defendant was tried jury waived and found guilty on both indictments.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">We shall discuss first whether there was a transferable offense under G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 61. The defendant argues that he was not charged with an offense \u201cinvolving the infliction or threat of serious bodily harm\u201d as required by \u00a7 61, and, therefore, that there was no statutory basis for conducting a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>transfer hearing<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and no jurisdiction in the Superior Court. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>379 Mass. 623, 626 (1980). He claims the word \u201cthreat\u201d requires an intent to do harm and that an offense charging recldessness or negligence is not the subject of transfer. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">Prior to its amendment by St. 1975, c. 840, \u00a7 1, G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 61, provided that a child could be bound over to face prosecution for any criminal offense, no matter how trivial, including violations of city ordinances or town bylaws, \u201cif the court is of the opinion that the interests of the public require that he should be tried for said offense or violation, instead of being dealt with as a delinquent child . . . .\u201d After the Legislature, in response to <em>Breed </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>421 U.S. 519 (1975), had sent to the Governor an amended \u00a7 61 (to separate transfer hearings from the adjudicatory hearing on the charge), the Governor sought additional changes in the statute. His proposals narrowed the scope of the offenses for which a child may be criminally prosecuted and also provided standards for deciding which children should be transferred. Message of Governor, 1975 House Doc. No. 6808. As originally proposed by the Governor, clause (b) of the first paragraph of \u00a7 61 would have made transferable only those offenses \u201cinvolving the infliction or threat of serious bodily harm <em>which, if [committed by] an adult, would be punishable by imprisonment in the state </em>prison\u201d (emphasis supplied). 1975 House Doc. No. 6808, at 3. However, the Legislature eliminated the italicized words from clause <em>(b). </em>See 1975 House Journal 3084. Thus, under the bill which was enacted, the District Court has jurisdiction under clause <em>(b) </em>to bind over a child for an offense, whether it be a felony or only a misdemeanor, so long as the offense involves the \u201cinfliction or threat of serious bodily harm.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">One of the meanings of \u201cthreat,\u201d as defined in the American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>(1976) at 1340, is \u201cAn indication of impending danger or harm.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The first phrase of the disjunction, <em>i.e., </em>the \u201cinfliction of . . . harm,\u201d has no requirement that the infliction of harm be intentional, and we see nothing to indicate that the second phrase, \u201cthreat... of harm,\u201d should be construed differently. There is nothing either in the language of the statute or in its legislative history which limits \u201cthreat of . . . harm\u201d to intentional threats. Contrast N.J. Rev. St. \u00a7 2A: 4-48 (Supp. 1980), which allows transfer where there is cause to believe a juvenile \u201ccommitted an offense against the person in an aggressive, violent and willful manner.\u201d The Legislature has also in other contexts used the term \u201cthreat\u201d to include nonintentional threats, <em>e.g., </em>G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 22(a), as appearing in St. 1969, c. 637 (registrar may revoke license after violation of motor vehicle law, if he has reason to believe that continued operation constitutes \u201cimmediate threat to the public safety\u201d); G. L. c. 21C, \u00a7 7, inserted by St. 1979, c. 704, \u00a7 2 (requiring certification that hazardous waste does not \u201cconstitute a danger to public health ... or a threat to the environment\u201d). There is at least one other statute where, as here, the word \u201cthreat\u201d covers both meanings. General Laws c. 276, \u00a7 42A, inserted by St. 1978, c. 447, \u00a7 5, permits a court to impose such terms as will insure the safety of a person on a complaint \u201cwhich involves the infliction, or the imminent threat of infliction, of physical harm upon a person . . . .\u201d We think that the natural reading of \u00a7 61 is that it authorizes transfers where an offense involves a danger (threat) of serious bodily harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">The defendant urges that his construction is supported by legislative intent. We do not agree. In A <em>Juvenile </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>370 Mass. 272, 281-282 (1976) (hereinafter referred to as <em>Juvenile T), </em>and again in A <em>Juvenile </em>v. <em>Commonwealth (No. 1), </em>380 Mass. 552, 559 (1980) <em>(Juvenile II), </em>the Supreme Judicial Court stated that \u201cthe Legislature intended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>that noncriminal treatment is to be favored and that transfer should be ordered only when warranted by exceptional circumstances.\u201d See also G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 53, providing for liberal construction of the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 52-63 inclusive.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The legislative preference for noncriminal treatment is a significant and useful guide to a judge exercising discretion under \u00a7 61 and other provisions of c. 119 relating to delinquent minors, and it is in the context of discretionary action that the Supreme Judicial Court, in <em>Juvenile I </em>and <em>Juvenile II, </em>spoke of legislative intent. We note that c. 119, \u00a7 53, is also directed primarily to the discretion of the trial judge. As indicated earlier, <em>supra </em>at 389, when \u00a7 53 of c. 119 was enacted in 1906, jurisdiction existed under \u00a7 61 to transfer a juvenile for any offense, including violations of a town by-law, and the judge\u2019s discretion was only limited by the welfare of the child and the interests of the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">In any event, even if the cited legislative preference is relevant in construing the jurisdictional question, it is not of assistance here. It sheds no light on what is meant by the term \u201cthreat,\u201d and does not support the conclusion that any offense involving an intentional threat, <em>e.g., </em>simple assault, is more appropriate for transfer than an offense which endangers the lives of the public. It may be that such a distinction is advisable as a matter of policy, but, if so, that decision is one for the Legislature. Section \u00a7 61, clause (b), first paragraph, provides jurisdiction for transfer of offenses \u201cinvolving the infliction or threat of serious bodily harm.\u201d We hold that the offense of operating a motor vehicle negligently \u201cso that the lives or safety of the public might be en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>dangered\u201d (G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24[2][a], as appearing in St. 1975, c. 156, \u00a7 1)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> is such an offense.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">Since we conclude that the use of this meaning of the word \u201cthreat\u201d is a natural one and would be understood by persons of ordinary intelligence as applying to the offense charged here, there is no unforeseeable departure from precedent. We, therefore, find no merit in the defendant\u2019s due process argument. Cf. <em>Stokes </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>368 Mass. 754, 772-773 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">We turn next to the question whether the process of transfer was flawed by reason of a \u201c[sjerious deficiency in the subsidiary findings.\u201d <em>Juvenile II, </em>380 Mass. at 558. Because the decision of transfer is \u201ccritically important,\u201d <em>Kent </em>v. <em>United States, </em>383 U.S. 541, 560 (1966); see also <em>Juvenile I, </em>370 Mass. at 281; <em>Juvenile II, </em>380 Mass. at 559, extra measures of evidentiary protection for transfer proceedings have been provided by the Legislature and by court rule.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">By statutory mandate, the standard of proof in such cases must be \u201cclear and convincing.\u201d G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 61. The judge must make written findings that the child presents a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>significant danger to the public and is not amenable to rehabilitation, and must consider enumerated factors set forth in \u00a7 61. In addition, the Supreme Judicial Court has held that subsidiary findings are of \u201cvital significance.\u201d <em>Juvenile II, </em>380 Mass, at 558. This is both to ensure the \u201cutmost\u201d judicial care in making the decision of transfer, see <em>Custody of a Minor (No. 1), </em>377 Mass. 876, 885-886 (1979), and to permit meaningful review. <em>Kent </em>v. <em>United States, </em>383 U.S. at 561. See also <em>Cesarone </em>v. <em>Cesarone, </em>329 Mass. 217, 220 (1952); <em>Moran </em>v. <em>Moran, </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. 787, 788 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">The transfer order here does not meet these requirements. Moreover, it suffers from virtually the same deficiencies as did the order which was vacated in <em>Juvenile I. </em>In that case, where an intentional homicide was alleged, the Supreme Judicial Court held that the nature of the offense by itself could not demonstrate the need for transfer; otherwise, juvenile facilities would be restricted without legislative sanction to the treatment of those charged with minor offenses. <em>Juvenile I, </em>370 Mass. at 282-283. The case was remanded because there was an absence of subsidiary findings showing that the juvenile could not be rehabilitated within the juvenile structure as well as an absence of subsidiary findings indicating the basis for such a conclusion. <em>Juvenile II </em>required even more specificity in the necessary supporting findings for the crucial conclusion of nonamenability to rehabilitation. <em>Juvenile II, </em>380 Mass. at 559-562.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">Here, the only subsidiary finding made by the judge, see note 2, <em>supra, </em>was that the defendant had been committed to the Department of Youth Services on eight separate occasions. Reliance solely on the child\u2019s past record of delinquent behavior to show that the juvenile cannot be rehabilitated stands on the same footing as reliance solely on the nature of the offense. Permitting such a basis for transfer would restrict, without legislative sanction, the juvenile system to persons who do not have lengthy records of delinquent behavior, see <em>Juvenile I, </em>370 Mass, at 283, and would allow transfer without taking into account other significant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>factors required by the statute. In the absence of subsidiary findings, the present transfer order fails to show that \u201cthe nature of any past treatment efforts for the child\u201d (c. 119, \u00a7 61), a highly relevant factor, or any of the other specific statutory factors were given adequate consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">There are also no subsidiary findings supporting a conclusion based on \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d that the child poses a significant danger to the public. The fact that there is jurisdiction to transfer for a specific offense does not render nugatory the additional requirement that the judge must weigh, among other things, the seriousness of the particular offense in determining whether transfer should be ordered. Instead of using Uniform Form DCM-12, see note 10, <em>supra, </em>as a helpful aid and reminder in making subsidiary findings, the District Court judge used it as a substitute for those findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">We remand the matter to the Superior Court to be remanded to the District Court for a new hearing on the issue whether a transfer was appropriate on February 21, 1978. See <em>Haziel </em>v. <em>United States, </em>404 F.2d 1275, 1281-1282 (D.C. Cir. 1968); <em>Kemplen </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>428 F.2d 169, 178 (4th Cir. 1970); <em>Powell </em>v. <em>Hooker, </em>453 F.2d 652, 657 (9th Cir. 1971); <em>Knott </em>v. <em>Langlois, </em>102 R.I. 517, 530 (1967). The new hearing is to be conducted in accordance with the proper standards under G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 61, and is to be held promptly in view of the rapid approach of the juvenile\u2019s seventeenth birthday. If it should appear after such hearing that a transfer was not appropriate on February 21, 1978, the date of the original transfer, the defendant shall be treated as a delinquent child and will be entitled on motion in the Superior Court to a vacation of his convictions. If adequate revised findings indicate that the transfer was appropriate, the convictions will stand. See <em>Juvenile II, </em>380 Mass. at 562-563; <em>Kemplen </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>428 F.2d at 178. See also <em>Kent </em>v. <em>United States, </em>383 U.S. at 565.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b404-7\"> The appendix includes a document entitled \u201cDefendant\u2019s Statement of the Proceedings pursuant to Mass.R.App.P. 8(c).\u201d At oral argument it was agreed by the parties that the statement was approved by the judge, and the docket entries confirm that fact.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b404-8\"> \u201c <em>Finding and Order After Transfer Hearing. </em>Upon consideration at a transfer hearing held pursuant to G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 61, and Rule 208 of the Special Rules of the District Courts of Massachusetts, the court finds that probable cause exists to believe that the child has committed the offense or violation charged.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-9\">\u201cUpon further hearing, including consideration of evidence on, but not limited to, the seriousness of the alleged offense, the child\u2019s family, school <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>and social history, including said child\u2019s court and juvenile delinquency record, if any, adequate protection of the public, the nature of any past treatment efforts for the child and the likelihood of rehabilitation of the child, the court finds based upon clear and convincing evidence that the child presents a significant danger to the public as demonstrated by the nature of the offense charged and the child\u2019s past record of delinquent behavior, if any, and that the child is not amenable to rehabilitation as a juvenile. The court\u2019s reasons are as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-7\">\u201c <em>The Court finds that Defendant is not rehabilitable because he has been committed to D.Y.S. on 8 separate occasions commencing 9/74.

Officer Varley pursued the defendant who was on foot, with the officer being in a cruiser. The defendant, while fleeing, came to an elderly man getting out of his vehicle, the defendant pushed the man aside, jumped into the vehicle and drove the vehicle approximately one block. Because of the snow and traffic conditions, the defendant could go no further. The defendant put the vehicle in reverse, jumped out, so that the car came in motion toward the police cruiser. The officer operating the cruiser, placed his cruiser against the vehicle\u2019s rearward motion, to prevent it from injuring anyone, while Officer Varley pursued the defendant through Egleston Station and arrested him after a brief chase.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b405-10\">We do not consider these findings to be relevant. The review by a judge of the Superior Court is not a de novo review of the soundness of the decision made by the Juvenile Court judge, but rather is a determination whether there has been \u201ca material failing in the prescribed steps leading to the issuance of the order of transfer.\u201d A <em>Juvenile </em>v. <em>Commonwealth (No. 1), </em>380 Mass. 552, 557 (1980).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b406-6\"> The portion of c. 119, \u00a7 61, relevant to this opinion appears in St. 1975, c. 840, \u00a7 1, and is set forth below.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-7\">\u201cIf it is alleged in a complaint made under sections fifty-two to sixty-three, inclusive, that a child <em>(a) </em>who had previously been committed to the department of youth services as a delinquent child has committed an offense against a law of the commonwealth which, if he were an adult, would be punishable by imprisonment in the state prison; or <em>(b) </em>has committed an offense involving the infliction or threat of serious bodily harm, and in either case if such alleged offense was committed while the child was between his fourteenth and seventeenth birthdays, and if the court enters a written finding based upon clear and convincing evidence that the child presents a significant danger to the public as demonstrated by the nature of the offense charged and the child\u2019s past record of delinquent behavior, if any, and is not amenable to rehabilitation as a juvenile, the court may, after a transfer hearing held in accordance with such rules of court as shall be adopted for such purpose, dismiss the complaint.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-8\">\u201cAt said transfer hearing, which shall be held before any hearing on the merits of the charges alleged, the court shall find whether probable cause exists to believe that the child has committed the offense or violation as charged.
