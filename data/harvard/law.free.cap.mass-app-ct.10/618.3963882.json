L. c. 265, \u00a7 15) and two for assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon (G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 15A).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Of these charges the defendant was convicted, and his appeal raises questions as to: (1) the number of days his prison term should have been reduced by reason of his detention in jail while awaiting trial and sentencing; and (2) certain claimed errors in the instructions to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>1. <em>Jail credits. </em>The defendant received sentences of consecutive prison terms of not less than seven nor more than ten years for the two assaults with intent to murder and sentences of the same duration for the assaults and batteries with a dangerous weapon, the latter sentences to be served concurrently with the others.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">When he was sentenced the defendant had already spent 398 days in jail awaiting trial and during trial. For this the trial judge gave the defendant credit against one of the sentences he was to serve consecutively. General Laws c. 279, \u00a7 33A, as appearing in St. 1961, c. 75,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> requires a sentencing judge to give a defendant credit for time served in jail before sentencing while awaiting trial and during trial. It is the defendant\u2019s contention that the statute entitles him to 398 days\u2019 credit on each of the consecutive sentences, i.e., an aggregate of 796 days\u2019 credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">In order to reach this result the defendant makes a grammatical argument: The statute speaks of the prisoner as one deemed to have served so much of his sentence (singular), as opposed to sentences (plural), as he spent in confinement before receiving the sentence; thus, the argument proceeds, if a person receives multiple sentences, the credit must be applied to each of them. Because the statute affects liberty, the defendant contends, it is penal in nature (see <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Parole Bd., </em>352 Mass. 471, 474 [1967]) and entitles the prisoner to the benefit of the familiar rule of construction that an ambiguity resulting from a literal reading of a criminal statute shall be resolved in favor of the defendant. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Crosscup, </em>369 Mass. 228, 234 (1975). Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clinton, </em>374 Mass. 719, 721 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">This essentially technical argument could fairly be answered by a countervailing technical one, that G. L. c. 4, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>\u00a7 6, lays down a rule of construction that \u201c[w]ords importing the singular number may extend and be applied to several persons or things . . . .\u201d See <em>Grad </em>v. <em>Damon, </em>6 Mass. App. Ct. 160, 171 (1978), <em>S.C., 376 </em>Mass. 931 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">Much more to the point, however, is that the Legislature in enacting G. L. c. 279, \u00a7 33A, had in mind that it would be a \u201cfair and worthwhile practice\u201d to grant a prisoner credit for time in confinement before imposition of sentence. Report and Recommendations of the Governor\u2019s Committee to Study the Massachusetts Correctional System, 1955 Senate Doc. No. 750, at 75. In keeping with that intent, the approach in the cases has been to consider the subject of jail credits \u201cagainst the backdrop of fair treatment of the prisoner.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>366 Mass. 272, 275 (1974). See also <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>329 Mass. 445, 448 (1952); <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>336 Mass. 718, 721 (1958); <em>Manning </em>v. <em>Superintendent, Massachusetts Correctional Inst., Norfolk, </em>372 Mass. 387, 396 (1977); <em>Chalifoux v. Commissioner of Correction, </em>375 Mass. 424, 427-428 (1978). While discussing in the <em>Manning </em>case, <em>supra </em>at 392, a similar jail credit statute,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the court observed that the statutory purpose of the provisions was to afford relief to persons who because of inability to obtain bail were held in custody. See <em>Kinney, petitioner, </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. 457, 460 (1977). This consideration buttresses what we consider to be the fair and untortured reading of the statute: that a prisoner is to receive credit for all jail time \u2014 neither more nor less \u2014 served before sentencing which relates to the criminal episode for which the prisoner is sentenced,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>but does not receive credit greater than the number of days of his presentencing confinement. Had the defendant been able to make bail, he would have been obliged to serve the full consecutive sentences. Were the defendant to get double credit for presentencing confinement, he would serve 398 fewer days in prison than if he had made ba\u00fc. A statute designed to neutralize the consequence of inability to make bail should not be construed to lead to such a bizarre result.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">From what we have said it follows that were a sentence to expire with jail time credit unexhausted, that remaining time is to be applied to the balance of concurrent and consecutive sentences left to be served. Any sentence being served concurrently with a sentence to which a jail credit is applied should receive the benefit of the same credit so that the sentence in fact retains a concurrent status.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">2. <em>Claimed errors in jury instructions. </em>Although trial counsel took three exceptions to the judge\u2019s charge to the jury, none of those is argued on appeal. Rather the defendant raises claims of defect in the instructions not called to the attention of the judge at the time of trial. A claim of error not called to the attention of the trial court brings nothing to this court for review, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stokes, </em>374 Mass. 583, 589 (1978), unless the claimed error is of such dimension that allowing it to stand uncorrected would create \u201ca substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Freeman, </em>352 Mass. 556, 563-564 (1967).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> None of the asserted defects in the instructions which the defendant now argues presents such a risk. Upon a review of the entire instructions we find it can hardly be said, as the defense argues, that the judge trivialized the concept of reasonable doubt when he said, \u201cA fact is proved beyond a reasonable doubt when it is proved to that degree of certainty that satisfies your judgment and your consciences as reasonable men and women. It leaves in your mind a clear and settled conviction of guilt.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. An<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number><em>drews, post </em>866 (1980). Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ferreira, 373 </em>Mass. 116, 128-129 (1977); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pomerleau, ante </em>208, 213-214 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">There is no merit whatever to the defendant\u2019s complaint that the judge shifted to him the burden of disproving malice. He charged repeatedly and properly that the Commonwealth had to prove each element of the crime and that \u201cnothing is to be presumed against the defendant.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McInerney, 373 </em>Mass. 136, 150-151 (1977); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Watkins, 377 </em>Mass. 385, 388, cert. denied, 442 U.S. 932 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">Finally, when the charge is read as a whole, it is apparent that the judge did not charge the jury that a person is presumed to intend the consequences of his act, an instruction held defective in <em>Dejoinville </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>381 Mass. 246, 253-254 (1980), but rather, while expanding on the subject, he said, \u201cAs a general rule, it is reasonable to infer that a person ordinarily intends all the natural and probable consequences of any acts knowingly done . . . . \u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The use of the word \u201cinfer\u201d avoids the presumption said to be unlawful in <em>Sandstrom </em>v. <em>Montana, </em>442 U.S. 510, 515 (1979), and <em>Dejoinville. </em>See <em>Lannon </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>379 Mass. 786, 793 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b636-15\"> Each of the crimes alleged was committed on two victims, hence the four indictments.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b637-8\"> The full text of \u00a7 33A, is as follows: \u201cThe court on imposing a sentence of commitment to a correctional institution of the commonwealth, a house of correction, or a jail, shall order that the prisoner be deemed to have served a portion of said sentence, such portion to be the number of days spent by the prisoner in confinement prior to such sentence awaiting and during trial.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b638-6\">G.

He does receive credit for confinement under a separate charge (e.g., Federal) in which the State has a significant interest and which arises out of the same occurrence. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>366 Mass. 272, 276 (1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b639-7\"> As to counsel\u2019s heavy duty to call errors to the attention of the trial court, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fitzgerald, </em>380 Mass. 840, 842 n.2 (1980).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b640-8\"> This assertion of error we examine apart from the <em>Freeman </em>\u201crisk of miscarriage of injustice\u201d standard because it raises a claim whose constitutional significance was not established until after the defendant\u2019s trial. <em>LeBlanc </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>363 Mass. 171, 173-174 (1973).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
