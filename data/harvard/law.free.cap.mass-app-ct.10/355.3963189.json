All of these offenses were within the final jurisdiction of the District Court. After a hearing, the District Court judge allowed the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress and dismissed three of the charges. The judge found probable cause on the fourth charge, larceny under $100, and bound over the defendant to the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-14\">The defendant was thereafter indicted in the Superior Court on all four charges. The defendant filed a motion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>dismiss the four indictments, claiming that he had previously been placed in jeopardy by virtue of the District Court proceedings. On November 20, 1979, the Superior Court judge allowed the motion to dismiss, from which ruling the Commonwealth now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">The pertinent facts may be summarized briefly. On February 21, 1979, the Concord police received a complaint regarding a stolen tennis racquet, along with a description of the person and the vehicle involved. Shortly thereafter the police observed the defendant\u2019s vehicle<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and discovered a tennis racquet, matching the description given, in the rear seat.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">The defendant was placed under arrest and taken to the Concord police station. The defendant\u2019s vehicle was also towed to the station, whereupon an \u201cinventory search\u201d was conducted. As a result of the search, the police discovered the handgun and the hypodermic syringe.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">The Commonwealth argues that the allowance of the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss was error because the defendant was not twice placed in jeopardy for the same offenses. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">We agree with the result and reasoning of the Superior Court judge and concur in his finding that the District Court judge did not indicate at the outset, as he was required to do, whether the hearing was a trial on the merits or was merely for the purpose of determining probable cause. If we were to accept the Commonwealth\u2019s characterization of the proceedings in the District Court, we would be creating a hybrid process, one neither to determine probable cause nor to decide the merits.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> See <em>Corey </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>364 Mass. 137, 141-142 n.7 (1973); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clemmons, </em>370 Mass. 288, 290-291 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>It is well settled that, in order for jeopardy to attach, a trial on the merits must have begun. <em>Id. </em>It is equally clear that a District Court judge is now \u201crequired to announce whether he [is] conducting a probable cause hearing or a full trial on the merits before the hearing commence[s].\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Crosby, </em>6 Mass. App. Ct. 679, 681-682 (1978), citing <em>Corey </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra, </em>and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clemmons, supra. </em>Where there is no indication at the outset that the judge was considering declining jurisdiction, \u201cwe must infer that the judge intended to exercise jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clemmons, 370 </em>Mass. at 291.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">Although the District Court judge in the present case announced that he would dismiss three of the charges and decline jurisdiction on the larceny charge, it was not until the conclusion of the proceedings that he so indicated. A judge must at the outset \u201cunambiguously manifest his intention to decline jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Crosby, supra </em>at 683. On this record, there was no \u201cindication that the [District Court judge] was declining jurisdiction sufficient to put this case beyond the reach of <em>Clemmons.\u201d Id. </em>at 682.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">In addition to the District Court judge\u2019s failure to state unambiguously his intention to decline jurisdiction, it can be readily inferred from the conduct of the judge and both counsel in the course of the proceedings that the District Court had retained jurisdiction,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> that what might have appeared to be a suppression hearing was in fact from the outset a hearing on the merits combined with a hearing on the motion to suppress,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and that there was no present intention to transfer the case to the Superior Court. At one point, the assistant district attorney responded in the affirmative to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>the judge\u2019s direct and specific question whether he should \u201ctake jurisdiction.\u201d Examples of other record evidence are that (1) the assistant district attorney indicated in open court at the outset of the hearing that this is not \u201ca Superior Court case\u201d; (2) both counsel agreed that the motion would be dispositive of the case;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and (3) the judge held an evidentiary hearing at the conclusion of which he dismissed three of the complaints.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This and other conduct of the participants<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> in the District Court proceedings is consistent with the conclusion that the proceeding was a hearing on the merits. It is disingenuous for the Commonwealth to denominate otherwise such a hearing. Accordingly, because the District Court judge had begun to hear evidence before announcing the nature of the proceeding, we conclude that there was a trial on the merits. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Crosby, 6 Mass. App. Ct. at 683. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clemmons, </em>370 Mass. at 291. See also Serfass v. <em>United States, </em>420 U.S. 377, 388 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">In sum, we agree with the Superior Court judge that jeopardy attached at the District Court proceeding and that the defendant, if put to trial anew, would be twice placed in jeopardy for the same offenses. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Crosby, supra. Serfass </em>v. <em>United States, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">No question of \u201cmanifest necessity\u201d or the \u201cends of public justice\u201d is presented by the circumstances here. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Crosby, supra. </em>See <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Somerville, </em>410 U.S. 458, 459 (1973); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clemmons, supra </em>at 292.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>As we have decided this case on double jeopardy grounds, we need not reach the defendant\u2019s due process claim. However, it cannot be gainsaid that it would not be fair for the Commonwealth to play \u201cheads I win, tails you lose\u201d with defendants in such circumstances. See note 2, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">\n<em>Order dismissing indictments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b374-9\"> It is not clear from the transcript or briefs whether the defendant had stopped his car on his own accord or had been stopped by the police.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b374-10\"> In these circumstances there was no way for the defendant to know beforehand what the nature of the proceeding was. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clemmons, </em>370 Mass. 288, 291 n.2 (1976). It would also seem that fundamental fairness dictates that the Commonwealth ought to be required to state unequivocally at the outset of the hearing its intention.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b375-7\"> It is evident from the transcript of the hearing that it was understood that the evidence on the motion to suppress would be used by the judge on the merits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b375-8\"><em> </em>In this respect it can be observed that the judge found probable cause on the larceny complaint \u2014 the only one of the four charges which was not the subject of the motion to suppress.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b376-7\"> Deciding as we do that the District Court judge retained jurisdiction, it is not necessary to determine the effect of the prosecutor\u2019s and defense counsel\u2019s presenting to a trier of fact in a court of competent jurisdiction an issue both acknowledged to be determinative of the case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b376-8\"> Not only would it have been less confusing, but the appropriate action for the District Court judge to have taken at this juncture would have been to enter findings of not guilty on these three complaints.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b376-9\"> At the Superior Court hearing the assistant district attorney described the prosecutor\u2019s conduct during the course of the District Court proceedings as \u201ca bit serpentine.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
