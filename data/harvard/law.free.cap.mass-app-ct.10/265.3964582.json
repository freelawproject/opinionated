A judge of the Superior Court determined that it could not. We agree and affirm the judgment entered pursuant to his order.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-12\">The plaintiff, the representative of the regular police officers in the town of Medfield, brought suit in 1972, seeking orders compelling the defendant to compensate its members for vacation benefits from 1957 forward in accordance with the provisions of G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 HID, and G. L. c. 147, \u00a7\u00a7 16C and 17, as those sections have been interpreted by the decision in <em>Holyoke Police Relief Assn. </em>v. <em>Mayor of Holyoke, </em>358 Mass. 350 (1970). The defendant appears to concede that the plaintiff\u2019s members are entitled to pay<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>ment for the vacation benefits they seek from 1957 until 1972, when the town changed its personnel administration plan to reduce the three- and four-week vacation periods specified in c. 41, \u00a7 HID, to fifteen- and twenty-day periods respectively. Thereafter, the defendant contends the entitlement was effectively limited to what the town has in fact paid or provided for under the amended plan. The judge ruled that the plaintiff\u2019s members are \u201centitled to the continuing monetary benefits of G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 11 ID, and G. L. c. 147, \u00a7\u00a7 16C [and 17], as interpreted by the <em>Holyoke </em>Police case . . . [from] March, 1957, to the present. . . [with] interest on the monies due . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">General Laws c. 41, \u00a7 HID, inserted by St. 1949, c. 384, provides that: \u201cIn any . . . town which accepts this section, all members of its regular police . . . force may be granted a vacation without loss of pay [which] shall be computed in the following manner: \u2014 [f]or five years\u2019 service, but less than ten years\u2019 service, a vacation of three weeks[;] [f]or ten years\u2019 service or more, a vacation of four weeks.\u201d Medfield accepted the provisions of this statute in 1952. General Laws c. 147, \u00a7 16C, inserted by St; 1951, c. 346, \u00a7 1, provides that: \u201cMembers of the police department of every . . . town which accepts this section . . . shall be excused from duty for two days out of every seven without loss of pay . . . .\u201d General Laws c. 147, \u00a7 17, as amended through St. 1970, c. 886, \u00a7 1, provides: \u201cIn no case shall the number of such days off be less than . . . one hundred and four in each year in a town subject to section sixteen C, and they shall be in addition to any annual vacation now or hereafter allowed . . . and such annual vacation shall not be diminished on account thereof.\u201d Medfield appears to have accepted these statutes in 1957. In construing this configuration of statutes, the Supreme Judicial Court held in <em>Holyoke Police Relief Assn. </em>v. <em>Mayor of Holyoke, </em>358 Mass. 350 (1970), that the Legislature, in providing for vacations measured in \u201cweeks,\u201d meant calendar weeks, and that police officers are entitled to the number of calendar weeks of vacation specified in G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 111D, in addition to the total <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>of 104 days off specified in G. L. c. 147, \u00a7\u00a7 16C and 17. See <em>Gurley </em>v. <em>Bridgewater, </em>4 Mass. App. Ct. 149, 151 (1976); <em>Shea </em>v. <em>Springfield, </em>8 Mass. App. Ct. 883 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">The purported change brought about by the amendment to the personnel administration plan was a nullity because it contradicted the statutes. Once the town had accepted the provisions of G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 111D, and G. L. c. 147, \u00a7\u00a7 16C and 17, it was bound to allow and pay for vacation time in strict compliance with the statutory provisions. The town could not use the device of an amendment to its personnel plan, even though approved by a vote at a town meeting, to alter a statutory source of vacation entitlement or to seek to revoke its acceptance of the statutes, a fact implicitly recognized by the insertion of language in the vote adopting the amendment stating that any \u201cconflict\u201d between the amendment to the plan and \u201cany other law\u201d would be resolved in favor of the \u201cother law.\u201d Cf. <em>Nugent </em>v. <em>Wellesley, </em>9 Mass. App. Ct. 202, 204 (1980). See Hardy, Municipal Law \u00a7 15 (1971) (\u201cOnce having accepted a general act of the legislature, a city or town cannot revoke its acceptance, unless the particular act permits such revocation and sets up the legal machinery for it\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">The defendant argues that the words \u201cmay be granted a vacation\u201d in the first sentence of c. 41, \u00a7 HID, provided the town with discretionary authority to alter police vacation entitlement from time to time. The remainder of that statutory section and the <em>Holyoke </em>decision (358 Mass, at 354) make it plain that the vacation periods specified therein are mandatory. The defendants contended at oral argument that a sentence in the <em>Holyoke </em>case sanctions changing time off and vacations to fit a municipality\u2019s particular needs. The sentence in question states: \u201cThere is no occasion now to consider to what extent the city may adjust its arrangements on time off and vacations.\u201d <em>Holyoke, supra. </em>This sentence is followed by citations to the decisions in <em>Brucato </em>v. <em>Lawrence, </em>338 Mass. 612, 615-616 (1959), and <em>Chief of Police of Dracut </em>v. <em>Dracut, </em>357 Mass. 492, 496 (1970). Both of these cases, at the pages cited, affirm the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>settled rule that once a statute is accepted by a local municipality, it becomes \u201capplicable statute law, subject to change, as in the case of other statutes, only by subsequent action of the Legislature.\u201d <em>Brucato </em>at 616. <em>Brucato </em>also outlines the limited circumstances (none of which is applicable to the statutes involved in this case) under which a municipality may revoke acceptance of a previously accepted statute. See also G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 4A. And the decisions in <em>Gurley </em>v. <em>Bridgewater, </em>4 Mass. App. Ct. 149, 151 (1976), and <em>McNamara </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Westwood, </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. 805 (1977), are not helpful to the defendant\u2019s position because the municipalities involved in those cases had not accepted G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 HID <em>(Gurley), </em>or G. L. c. 147, \u00a7\u00a7 16C and 17 <em>(McNamara).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">Some final points require brief discussion. There is an intimation in the defendants\u2019 brief that the town was entrapped by the <em>Holyoke </em>decision and that, had the result in that case been foreseen, the town would not have accepted the statutes. The notion is without merit. Cf. <em>Broderick </em>v. <em>Mayor of Boston, </em>375 Mass. 98, 103 (1978). The question of the effect, if any, of collective bargaining agreements on the years in question was not put before the judge below. Accordingly we will not consider it or express any opinion thereon. See G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 1781, as in effect prior to St. 1973, c. 1078, \u00a7 1. See now G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 <em>7(d), (e), (h). </em>See also <em>Gurley </em>v. <em>Bridgewater, 4 </em>Mass. App. Ct. at 151. The same applies to questions as to possible laches or waiver on the part of the plaintiff\u2019s members. See <em>Shea </em>v. <em>Springfield, </em>8 Mass. App. Ct. 883, 884 (1979), citing <em>Erickson </em>v. <em>Waltham, </em>2 Mass. App. Ct. 436, 450-451. (1974). Interest on the amounts to be paid was also properly ordered by the judge. <em>Marlborough Firefighters, Local 1714 </em>v. <em>Marlborough, </em>375 Mass. 593, 600 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
