L. c. 55B, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>\u00a7 5.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The parties filed a statement of agreed facts, and the record of the proceedings before the Commission, including the transcript and exhibits, was admitted in evidence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">The following facts are undisputed. The petition as filed contained 1,173 signatures in excess of the 55,868 minimum required.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Hebert challenged the validity of 1,740 signatures, and the Commission invalidated only 441, so that the objections failed to disqualify the measure by a margin of 732 signatures (1,173 - 441 = 732).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">The plaintiff\u2019s objections to 1,171 signatures relate to the jurats<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of one Hyatt, who was an official of an organization entitled Citizens for Limited Taxation (C.L.T.), which was the moving force behind the initiative petition. A number of improprieties or irregularities appeared in connection with some sheets of the petition in which Hyatt was involved. He signed the name of his wife as \u201cjurattor\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> on one petition and the name of his father on another, and he executed jurats on twenty-one other petition sheets containing a total of 117 signatures which the Commission deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>mined to be nongenuine. Hyatt\u2019s testimony before the Commission indicated that he had signed as \u201cjurattor\u201d on numerous sheets which he had not personally circulated, and he could not at the time of the hearing determine by looking at the sheets which person had circulated any particular sheet.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">The plaintiff argues for invalidation of 1,171 signatures on two grounds. First, he claims that 455 signatures should have been invalidated because they appear on the same twenty-one sheets on which there are 117 invalid signatures and that those sheets are tainted in their entirety. Second, he claims that because of the improprieties committed by Hyatt on the twenty-one sheets, all the remaining sheets which Hyatt had circulated and which also contain his jurat, involving 716 signatures, are also \u201ccontaminated\u201d and should have been rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">The Commission invalidated all the signatures on the sheets on which the jurats of Hyatt\u2019s father and wife appeared, and also all the nongenuine signatures on the twenty-one sheets. There were 455 genuine signatures on those sheets, and none of those signatures was invalidated. The Commission refused to invalidate the other 716 genuine signatures<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> on the sheets which Hyatt had circulated. (In its findings, the Commission stated that it used the \u201cterm \u2018non-genuine\u2019 rather than \u2018forged\u2019 ... to emphasize that many of the signatures invalidated were apparently signed in good faith, often by a spouse or other close family member.\u201d) It also found that Hyatt, in executing the jurats on the twenty-one sheets of the petition which he did not circulate, \u201ccould have reasonably believed that the persons from whom he received the completed petition forms were trustworthy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>The trial judge\u2019s \u201cfindings\u201d indicate that all counsel agreed that \u201cthere was no intent on the part of Mr. Hyatt or anyone from C.L.T. to defraud\u201d and that \u201cthe circulators numbered in the thousands.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">Hebert\u2019s action to review the Commission\u2019s decision purports to be brought under both G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14, and G. L. c. 56, \u00a7 59. As the Commission\u2019s decision was clearly reviewable under G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (compare <em>Molesworth </em>v. <em>State Ballot Law Commn., </em>348 Mass. 23, 24, 29 [1964]),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> we need not decide whether G. L. c. 56, \u00a7 59, was also available.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">The Commission properly refused to discard the genuine signatures of 716 voters on those sheets on which Hyatt appears as the \u201cjurattor.\u201d Unlike the law in a few jurisdictions, e.g., <em>Tyler </em>v. <em>Secretary of State, </em>229 Md. 397, 404 (1962), and <em>Nist </em>v. <em>Herseth, </em>270 N.W.2d 565, 568 (S.D. 1978), Massachusetts does not require a circulator to be \u201can eyewitness to the affixing of every signature.\u201d <em>Molesworth </em>v. <em>State Ballot Law Commn., </em>348 Mass. at 28. He can satisfy the requirements of G. L. c. 53, \u00a7 22B, by relying \u201cupon some trusted person.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Commission\u2019s finding that Hyatt relied on persons he \u201creasonably believed to be trustworthy\u201d is supported by substantial evidence. He testified that in almost all instances he knew where the petitions came from, and specifically stated, \u201cIf I trusted the individual who brought the sheet to me, I wouldn\u2019t have any problem about jurating it. I am not aware of any occasions where I jurated any multiple number of sheets or any sheets where I didn\u2019t have a very good idea of where it came from.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">While we do not condone the improprieties and careless operations of C.L.T. and Hyatt, we do not believe the constitutional right to initiate petitions or the purposes of c. 53, \u00a7 22B, would be served by adopting Hebert\u2019s contamination theory in the circumstances of this case. See art. 48, Gen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>eral Provisions, VII, of the Amendments to the Massachusetts Constitution. Nor do the authorities cited by Hebert support such contamination. There are no procured forged signatures, or other evidence of knowledge of fraud or fraudulent conduct by the circulators of the sheets of the petition. See, e.g., <em>Sturdy </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>201 Ark, 38, 44-45 (1940); <em>Jensen </em>v. <em>Wells, </em>66 S.D. 269, 273-274 (1938). There is no evidence of massive fraud or other irregularities. See, e.g., <em>Proskin </em>v. <em>May, </em>40 N.Y.2d 829 (1976). As pointed out in <em>State </em>v. <em>Olcott, </em>62 Or. 277, 286 (1912), \u201c[I]n the absence of evidence of intentional fraud or guilty knowledge on the part of the circulator, it would be an unjust rule to deprive the honest signer of his right to have his signature counted, merely because some disqualified person signed, or because some person, without the knowledge of the circulator, affixed a fictitious name, or gave a fictitious address.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">Nor does <em>United Labor Comm. </em>v. <em>Kirkpatrick, </em>572 S.W.2d 449 (Mo. 1978), on which Hebert relies, support his position. All the court indicated in that case was that where irregularities occurred in affidavits or notarial attestations, the petition no longer had prima facie validity and further examination was required. Although the court used language of \u201cshifting the burden\u201d to the proponents of the signatures to show their underlying validity, no more proof of validity was required in that case than was presented here. The petitions were upheld after the validity of the signatures was shown through voter registration list checks and testimony of circulators. Moreover, in that case, unlike here, the statutory affidavits and notarial certificates were executed in express violation of statutory provisions. The language of the court indicates that the \u201cburden\u201d it placed on the proponents was not great. \u201c[W]e should look to the purpose of that affidavit and of that verification. The rationale behind initiative amendments is that a sufficient number of registered voters deem an issue important enough that the issue should be put to a vote before the people. The assertation [sic] of this constitutional right by the required number of legal voters should not be lightly cast <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>aside.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 453. The purpose of the jurat is to provide a check on the signatures. \u201cIf the validity of the voters\u2019 signatures can be otherwise verified, their signatures should not be invalidated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 454.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">Since we have upheld the Commission as to the validity of the 716 signatures, we need not consider the remaining objections of Hebert, because even if we were to invalidate all the other signatures challenged by him (including the 455 signatures on the twenty-one sheets), he would still not overcome the margin of valid signatures.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b294-7\"> General Laws c. 55B, \u00a7 5, inserted by St. 1977, c. 927, \u00a7 14, effective January 1, 1979, reads in pertinent part as follows: \u201cObjections that signatures appearing on an initiative or referendum petition have been forged or placed thereon by fraud and that in consequence thereof the petition has not been signed by a sufficient number of qualified voters actually supporting such petition, as required by the constitution, or any other objection relating to signatures on such petitions, may be filed with the state secretary . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b294-8\"> Article 48, of the Amendments to the Massachusetts Constitution, The Initiative, V, \u00a7 1, as amended by art. 81, \u00a7 2, requires that such petitions be signed by \u201cnot less than such numbers of voters as will equal three per cent of the entire vote cast for governor at the preceding biennial state election.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b294-9\"> General Laws, c. 53, \u00a7 22B, as amended by St. 1961, \u00a7 344, provides in relevant part: \u201cEach initiative . . . petition . . . shall contain a statement signed under the penalties of perjury by the person who circulated the petition, that each person whose name appears on said petition signed the same in person.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b294-10\">As used herein, and by the Supreme Judicial Court in <em>Molesworth </em>v. <em>State Ballot Lato Commn., </em>348 Mass. 23, 28 (1964), the term \u201cjurattor\u201d designates the person making the statement under the penalties of perjury which is required by G.
