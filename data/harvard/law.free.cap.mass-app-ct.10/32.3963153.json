Mass.R.Civ.P. 56, 365 Mass. 824 (1974). In its action Travi sought to recover the sum of $7,500, representing the face amount of a cashier\u2019s check issued by the Bank to Travi as payee. The Bank stopped payment on this check because Travi purchased it with a personal check it had received from the third-party defendant Lesser. Lesser\u2019s check was drawn on the Bank, but he placed a stop-payment order on his check prior to Travi\u2019s presentment of it at the Bank in exchange of the cashier\u2019s check. Due to an error on its part, the Bank accepted Lesser\u2019s check and issued its cashier\u2019s check to Travi. When the cashier\u2019s check was sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>sequently presented to the Bank by Travi\u2019s bank, the Bank refused to honor it, and Travi brought suit. The Bank argues that it can refuse to honor its cashier\u2019s check for a failure of consideration when it is presented by a party to the instrument with whom the Bank has dealt. We agree, and we reverse the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">There are two conflicting lines of authority on the question whether a bank can dishonor its cashier\u2019s check. Those jurisdictions which apply a flat prohibition against dishonor of a cashier\u2019s check by the issuing bank do so on the reasoning that a cashier\u2019s check is a bill of exchange or draft drawn by a bank upon itself and accepted in advance by the act of its issuance. Because a stop-payment order must be made prior to acceptance of the instrument, Uniform Commercial Code, \u00a7 4-303(a), a cashier\u2019s check cannot be dishonored.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Some jurisdictions refuse to recognize such an iron-clad rule, and they allow a bank to dishonor its cashier\u2019s check in certain situations, primarily a failure of consideration. In such a case the bank may assert its own defenses against one who is not a holder in due course.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>This conflict among jurisdictions is treated by Brady on Bank Checks, wherein it is concluded, at \u00a7 20.12, at 20-30 \u2014 20-31 (5th ed. 1979), \u201cWhile courts have not set forth a clear rule on this matter, it would seem that courts which hold flatly that payment may not be stopped are in error .... In short, the rule that payment may not be stopped on a cashier\u2019s check should not be regarded as an immutable principle; under some situations, it would seem that the issuing bank ought to be able to resist payment.\u201d To each dispute Brady would apply the \u201cfinality of payment\u201d rule found in \u00a7 3-418 of the Uniform Commercial Code.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Jurisdictions eschewing the flat prohibition against dishonor take notice of the fact that the analysis of the question employed by conflicting courts depends upon the premise that a cashier\u2019s check is a draft. For example, in <em>TPO, Inc. </em>v. <em>Federal Deposit Ins. Corp., </em>487 F.2d 131, 135-136 (3d Cir. 1973), the court observed that the \u201cacceptance upon issuance\u201d reasoning fails when \u00a7 3-118(a) of the Uniform Commercial Code is applied to a cashier\u2019s check. That section of the Code states: \u201cWhere there is doubt whether the instrument is a draft or a note the holder may treat it as either. A draft drawn on the drawer is effective as a note.\u201d The observation that a cashier\u2019s check is a negotiable promissory note and not a draft is, however, by no means central to the rule that a bank may, in certain circumstances, dishonor its cashier\u2019s check. These cases turn on whether the holder of the check is a holder in due course because \u201cwhether a bank is considered to have accepted a cashier\u2019s check, as a draft, by the act of its issuance, or is considered to be the maker of a note, it is primarily obligated upon the instrument.\u201d <em>Ban-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number><em>co Ganadero y Agricola, S. A. </em>v. <em>Society Natl. Bank, </em>418 F. Supp. 520, 523 (N.D. Ohio 1976). See also 6 E. Bender\u2019s Uniform Commercial Code Service, Reporter \u2014 Digest \u00a7 2-1194 (Willier &amp; Hart, 1980) (\u201cThis difference alone would not alter the result, however, since the liability of an acceptor is precisely the same as that of a maker. See Section 3-413[l]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">We are persuaded that an issuing bank may refuse to hon- or its cashier\u2019s check because of a failure of consideration when the check is held by a party to the instrument with whom it has dealt. We do not look to either G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 3-118(a) or \u00a7 3-418, in reaching this conclusion. Instead, we rely upon the fact that in this limited situation the policy concerns which justify a rule against dishonor do not exist, and there is overwhelming reason for an exception to the rule. As stated in <em>TPO, Inc., </em>487 F.2d at 135, \u201cthere are no third parties, or customers of the Bank, or holders in due course whose rights are involved .... Hence, the strong considerations of public policy favoring negotiability and reliability of cashier\u2019s checks are not germane.\u201d Compare <em>Dziurak </em>v. <em>Chase Manhattan Bank, </em>58 App. Div. 2d 103, 107 (N.Y. 1977). Moreover, where the bank, and not its customer, stops payment on a cashier\u2019s check, the bank\u2019s reputation and credit are not exposed to third-party reprobation. See 6 Michie, Banks and Banking 371 (1975). Compare White &amp; Summers, Uniform Commercial Code 579, n.91 (1972) (concern for a bank\u2019s reputation and credit may be legitimate where a customer can demand that its bank stop payment on a cashier\u2019s check).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">These policy concerns are not at issue in the present case. The Bank received Lesser\u2019s stop-payment order on March 30, 1978, at 5:15 p.m. Travi presented Lesser\u2019s check at the Bank\u2019s branch office on Friday, March 31, sometime between 12:00 m. and 1:00 p.m. The cashier\u2019s check was presented to the Bank for payment by Travi\u2019s bank on or about April 4. Lesser\u2019s account cannot be charged; the Bank admits his stop-payment order was timely made.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Travi has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>received no funds on account of the cashier\u2019s check which bears the stamped legend \u201cPayment Stopped.\u201d The check cannot fall into the hands of an innocent third party. In this situation, we perceive no policy need for application of a stringent rule prohibiting the Bank\u2019s dishonor of its cashier\u2019s check.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">The issue for resolution is whether the Bank has a defense which it can assert against Travi\u2019s presentment of the check for payment. Travi argues that it does not. It claims that the pleadings, the affidavits, and the Bank\u2019s responses to interrogatories demonstrate that there is no dispute that Travi took the cashier\u2019s check in good faith and without notice of the fact that Lesser had stopped payment on his check. We reject Travi\u2019s assessment of the affidavits,* ***<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> but even were we to agree that Travi holds the check as a holder in due course, Travi would not be sheltered from the Bank\u2019s defense to payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">The Bank received Lesser\u2019s order before it issued its check to Travi, and it has no right to charge Lesser\u2019s account with the amount of his check. \u201c A complete failure of consideration for the [cashier\u2019s] check resulted and the bank had the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>right to refuse to honor it when presented by the payee.\u201d <em>Wilmington Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Delaware Auto Sales, </em>271 A.2d 41, 42 (Del. 1970). While the defense of a failure of consideration cannot be asserted against a holder in due course, compare G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 3-305(2) with \u00a7\u00a7 3-306 and 3-408, even a holder in due course takes an instrument subject to the defenses of any party to the instrument with whom the holder has dealt, G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 3-305(2). See <em>Waltham Citizens Natl. Bank </em>v. <em>Flett, </em>353 Mass. 696, 699 (1968). See also <em>Wilmington Trust, supra; Brotherton </em>v. <em>McWaters, </em>438 P.2d 1, 4 (Okla. 1968); Brady on Bank Checks, <em>supra </em>at 9-7 \u2014 9-8, 15-3; Quinn, UCC Commentary and Law Digest par. 3-305(A) (5) (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">The Bank had a right to refuse to honor its cashier\u2019s check because of a failure of consideration when the check was presented by Travi, a party to that instrument with whom the Bank had dealt. The foregoing analysis obviates the need to consider the Bank\u2019s remaining contention<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> because it establishes that summary judgment against Travi is appropriate under Mass.R.Civ.P. 56(c), 365 Mass. 824 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">The order allowing Travi\u2019s motion for summary judgment and the judgment are reversed. The Superior Court is to enter a new judgment dismissing the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b51-6\">See <em>Swiss Credit Bank </em>v. <em>Virginia Natl.

South Shore Natl. Bank, </em>366 Mass. 74, 78 (1974), the court hinted that the rule applied to certified checks, it would also be applicable to cashier\u2019s checks.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b53-7\">Lesser\u2019s order, although timely under G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 4-303, was received by the Bank after the \u201ccut-off\u201d time of 4:30 p.m. for its computer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>center to process the work for that day. The order was then posted at the close of business on March 31. The Bank\u2019s mistake occurred when, for some reason not revealed on the record before us, Lesser\u2019s order was not manually brought forward on his account on the morning of March 31.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b54-11\"> Lesser alleged in his affidavit that he notified Travi\u2019s bookkeeper and president by telephone and \u201cexplained that I was stopping payment on my check\u201d to Travi. Travi\u2019s bookkeeper and president denied any such notice from Lesser in their affidavits. Travi claims that a factual dispute as to its status as a holder in due course does not exist because the Bank\u2019s answers to interrogatories demonstrate that Lesser stopped payment on his check at 5:15 p.m. on March 30, after his alleged notice to Travi\u2019s employees. Travi concludes that, even if Lesser\u2019s affidavit is accepted, it shows only a threat or indication that payment on his check might be stopped, and Travi could not have had knowledge of the order when it presented Lesser\u2019s check. Lesser\u2019s affidavit was sufficient to dispute Travi\u2019s status as a holder in due course on the elements of good faith and notice. G.L. c. 106, \u00a7\u00a7 1-201(19) and (25).

Mass.R.Civ. P. 13(a), 365 Mass. 758 (1974). The basis for the counterclaim was that when Travi endorsed Lesser\u2019s check, it engaged that upon dishonor it would pay the instrument according to the tenor at the time of its endorsement. G.
