L. 30A, \u00a7 14) of a decision by the Department of Environmental Quality Engineering (DEQE) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>which granted Robert J. Fossa and Barbara Fossa (the Fossas) a permit pursuant to G. L. c. 91, \u00a7 10A, to build a foot ramp and attached float to be held by bottom moorings in the Annisquam River<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and set aside the action of the harbormaster of the city of Gloucester in refusing to grant such a permit. The Fossas seek to build these structures on flats owned by the plaintiff<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> between the high and low water mark over which the Fossas claim an easement under a recorded deed which grants them \u201ca right of way to the Annisquam River over a parcel of land eight (8) feet in width.\u201d Also a defendant is one Mehran Juskalian who claims an easement identical to that of the Fossas. The defendants Juskalian and the Fossas filed counterclaims requesting, among other things, a declaration under G. L. c. 231A determining the extent of their easement rights. The plaintiff and the counterclaimants filed motions for summary judgment with supporting affidavits. The Superior Court entered judgment on these motions, affirming the decision of the DEQE and declaring that \u201cthe defendants\u2019 easement rights\u201d extend over the flats in question. The plaintiff appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">1. <em>The permit under G. L. c. 91, </em>\u00a7 <em>10A. </em>The plaintiff\u2019s attack on the decision of the DEQE relies on the provision in the fourth paragraph of that section set out in the margin.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> His position that the objection of the \u201cowner\u201d is fatal to the Fossas\u2019 permit was also the basis of the harbormaster\u2019s refusal to grant the permit and resulted in the Fossas\u2019 appeal to the DEQE. See G. L. c. 91, \u00a7 10A, second and third pars. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>We do not read the fourth paragraph so woodenly. The plaintiff\u2019s reading would permit the owner of a servient estate, merely by objecting to the harbormaster or the DEQE, to prevent the owner of an easement from exercising a right to moor floats or rafts, even though that right may have been specifically granted. It would indeed be extraordinary if the Legislature intended so drastic a curtailment of the rights of an easement holder. See <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>365 Mass. 681, 685-690 (1974). It would also be anomalous for the Legislature to impose the responsibility of adjudicating property interests \u2014 traditionally left to the courts \u2014 on the harbormaster, whose powers are narrow, see, e.g., <em>Scituate </em>v. <em>Maxwell, </em>339 Mass. 436, 440-441 (1959), or on the DEQE, whose area of expertise is far removed from such adjudication. See. G. L. c. 91, \u00a7 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">Further, the legislative history of the fourth paragraph indicates' no intent to accomplish such results. The fourth paragraph emerged as a compromise, fashioned by a conference committee, between the final House version and the final Senate version of the bill which eventuated in \u00a7 10A. Both the House and the Senate versions, when referred to the conference committee, contained two paragraphs. In both bills the first paragraph set out the powers of the harbormaster substantially as now set out in the first paragraph of \u00a7 10A. The Senate version of the second paragraph provided, as does the present statute, a right to appeal action by the harbormaster under the first paragraph by a \u201cperson aggrieved by a refusal to\u201d issue a permit. The House version, however, gave such right of appeal not only to a person refused a permit, but also to any person aggrieved by the grant of a permit. It seems significant to us that the bill reported by the conference committee and passed by the House and Senate retained the Senate version (\u201cany person aggrieved by a refusal\u201d only) but added the fourth paragraph (as well as the three subsequent paragraphs presently in the statute.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>In these circumstances, it seems hardly likely that the Senate would acquiesce in a fourth paragraph that went quite beyond a right of appeal and gave an absolute veto to an owner of private flats despite whose objection a permit had been granted. This legislative history leads us to believe that the fourth paragraph gives to a person aggrieved by the grant of a permit to another something less, rather than something more, than standing to appeal to the DEQE. The fourth paragraph, as we read it, substitutes, for standing to contest the grant of a permit to another, an assurance to an owner in the plaintiff\u2019s position that such a grant does not affect the assertion of his property rights in an appropriate judicial forum. This interpretation finds support in the subsequent fifth paragraph of \u00a7 10A, also added by the conference committee, which declares that action by a harbormaster or the DEQE under \u00a7 10A does not affect laws administered by the division of motor boats, the division of marine fisheries, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">Thus, we see no violation of DEQE\u2019s statutory responsibility in refusing to adjudicate the conflicting property claims. In the case at bar, the DEQE ruled \u201cthat the existence of a dispute as to whether the Applicants\u2019 easement over the land in question is sufficiently broad to encompass the installation of the proposed temporary float and moorings is not a proper reason for the Gloucester Harbormaster or for [the department] to deny approval of the proposal under G. L. Chapter 91, section 10A.\u201d It further found that \u201cthe Applicants have asserted a colorable<footnotemark>[5]</footnotemark> claim to the right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>to carry out the proposed work. It is not the proper role of either this Department or the Gloucester Harbormaster to act as a judicial arbiter in a dispute over private property rights.\u201d Perhaps out of an abundance of caution, the DEQE further imposed a condition in its decision that it \u201capplies only to the substantive navigational, safety and environmental aspects of the proposed work. It does not grant any property rights or exclusive privileges, nor does it authorize any injury to private property or invasion of private rights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">This seems to us to be sensible administration with which we cannot quarrel. Indeed, it is justified by the phraseology of the fourth paragraph, for in determining that the defendants are not complete strangers to the private flats here involved, the DEQE has determined (in terms of the fourth paragraph) that these are not \u201cprivate flats of other than the applicant\u201d so that the owner\u2019s consent does not come into play.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">2. <em>Easement Rights. </em>The plaintiff attacks the declaration of the defendants\u2019 easement rights in par. l.b of the judgment<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> on the ground that the granted easement does not, as a matter of law, permit mooring a float and maintaining a ramp on the right of way.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">From the affidavits, it is undisputed that the portion of the right of way from the uplands to the low water mark is impassable mud at low tide. Accordingly, the defendants have \u201cthe right to make [the right of way], passable and usable for its entire width having due regard to the rights and interests of others. This follows from the general principle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>that when an easement or other property right is created, every right necessary for its enjoyment is included by implication.\u2019 <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Donohoe, </em>287 Mass. 265, 267 (1934).\u201d <em>Guillet </em>v. <em>Livernois, </em>297 Mass. 337, 340 (1937). See <em>Churchill </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>257 Mass. 499, 502 (1962). Their easements thus permit the defendants to place such structures on the right of way as are reasonably necessary to its use, having due regard for the plaintiff\u2019s rights and interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">Beyond this, however, the parties interpret par. l.b of the judgment as declaring the scope of the defendants\u2019 \u201ceasement rights\u201d to include the right to maintain the ramp and moor the float for which the Fossas received permission from the DEQE. This is also reflected in the judge\u2019s conclusion that \u201c[t]he float in question is necessary for the defendants\u2019 enjoyment of their easement rights.\u201d But reasonableness of use was a question of fact, <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Mart Realty of Brockton, Inc., </em>348 Mass. 675, 679 (1965); <em>Meehan </em>v. <em>Barry, </em>97 Mass. 447, 450 (1867); <em>Churchill </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>257 Mass. at 502; <em>Guillet </em>v. <em>Livemois, </em>297 Mass. at 341, and created a triable issue which the affidavits did not obviate. Thus, the declaration on summary judgment in par. l.b was erroneous. <em>Community Natl. Bank </em>v. <em>Dawes, </em>369 Mass. 550, 553 (1976). <em>Lurensky </em>v. <em>Merchants Beef Co., post </em>832 (1980), and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">Accordingly, the judgment is reversed, and the case remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion. Such proceedings may include the entry of a partial summary judgment (see Mass.R.Civ.P. 54[b], 365 Mass. 821 [1974]), incorporating paragraphs l.a and l.c of the judgment.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b642-6\"><em> </em>All the parties agree that this is the effect of the DEQE decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b642-7\"> For a discussion of the property rights in flats, see <em>Boston Waterfront Deo.
