G. L. c. 40, \u00a7 4, thirteenth par. The project appears to have involved certain required work, including \u201cground control and photography, manuscript preparation from photography, aero triangulation, block bridging, calculations, research, platting of boundaries, final drafting of maps, data card production and other reproduction,\u201d as well as optional work involving preparation of \u201cMassachusetts coordinates for each lot, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>[location of] building designation symbol[s] on each lot, [provision for a] stereo reader for the use of the city [with] filing system, [and] maintenance after the first year.\u201d The plaintiffs, two corporations acting together in a joint venture, submitted a total bid of $178,950 for both aspects of the contract. The board of assessors, based on \u201ccost, the in-house capability of the respective bidders, and compliance with the specifications,\u201d recommended to the mayor and city council that the contract be awarded to a Maine firm. The city council authorized the mayor to enter a contract with that firm for a price of $184,450. The plaintiffs brought suit seeking to invalidate the contract and to recover damages on the ground that they were entitled to the award of the contract as the lowest responsible and eligible bidder under the provisions of G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 39M(a), as amended through St. 1977, c. 970, \u00a7 l.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A Superior Court judge allowed the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim under Mass.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), 365Mass. 755 (1974). The plaintiffs have appealed from the judgment dismissing their action. There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">The parties are in agreement on the essential facts outlined above. On these facts, the sole legal question addressed to the judge below and to us is whether the award of this contract was subject to the competitive bidding provisions of G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 39M, which requires that contracts for the \u201cconstruction, reconstruction, alteration, remodeling or re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>pair of any public work\u201d be awarded to the lowest responsible and eligible bidder. In contending that the contract is subject to the statute, the plaintiffs focus their attention exclusively on the term \u201cpublic work\u201d in the first sentence of the statute and base their argument in part on an abstract lexical definition of the term which is not conclusive on the question, nor helpful to their position. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1781 (4th ed. rev. 1968).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See now Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1440 (5th ed. 1979). The defendants, on the other hand, have cited numerous cases from other jurisdictions which hold that municipal contracts for personal services requiring special skills or abilities are not subject to competitive bidding laws. See generally, 10 McQuillin, Municipal Corporations \u00a7 29.35 (3d rev. ed. 1966). None of the cited cases appear to be based on a statute bearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>any close resemblance to G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 39M. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>W. Barrington, Inc., </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. 416, 419 (1977). We think that a better reasoned answer to the question can be obtained by examining the history and language of \u00a7 39M and considering the statutory framework in which it appears.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">In context, \u00a7 39M applies only to contracts for the \u201cconstruction, reconstruction, alteration, remodeling or repair of any public work.\u201d That section was inserted by St. 1963, c. 842, \u00a7 1, which was entitled \u201cAn Act to require that all contracts for <em>construction </em>and for materials be awarded to the lowest responsible and eligible bidder, and to assure full competition in the taking of bids for <em>such contracts\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied). A bill underlying that act, which was introduced under virtually the same title, initially used the term \u201cconstruction work\u201d rather than \u201cpublic work\u201d and referred in one of its clauses to the \u201carchitect\u201d for the public agency inviting the bids. See 1963 Senate Doc. No. 563. Section 39M also requires competitive bidding on contracts for the purchase of any \u201cmaterial.\u201d That term as used in the statute is defined in paragraph <em>(e) </em>as \u201cany article, assembly, system, or any component part thereof\u201d; and it \u201cmust be interpreted as referring only to materials used in the construction, alteration, or repair of any public work.\u201d <em>Gosselin\u2019s Dairy, Inc. </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Holyoke, </em>348 Mass. 793 (1965). Section 39M also requires contracts written thereunder to provide for the substitution of an \u201citem equal to that named or described in the . . . specifications,\u201d i.e., \u201cit is at least equal in quality, durability, appearance, strength and design\u201d to the named item or \u201cwill perform at least equally the function imposed by the general design for the public work being contracted for or the material being purchased.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at (b)(1) and <em>(b)(2). </em>The last sentence of paragraph <em>(b) </em>of \u00a7 39M requires that material specifications for public work contracts provide for \u201ceach item ... a minimum of three named brands of material or a description of material which can be met by a minimum of three manufacturers or producers.\u201d Section 39N, which applies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>to all contracts subject to \u00a7 39M, makes provision for contract price adjustments when \u201cthe actual subsurface or latent physical conditions encountered at the site differ substantially or materially from those shown on the plans or indicated in the contract documents.\u201d In addition to \u00a7 39N, several other provisions of c. 30, \u00a7\u00a7 39A-39P, dealing with various rights and obligations of public contractors, employ the term \u201cpublic works\u201d with regard to projects involving the construction, repair, alteration or improvement of \u201cpublic ways [and] airports\u201d (\u00a7\u00a7 39A and 39B); and \u201cpublic ways, including bridges and other highway structures, sewers and water mains\u201d (\u00a7 39G). See also \u00a7 39H dealing with the \u201cconstruction ... of a public way\u201d and \u00a7 391 concerning the \u201cconstruction ... of any public building.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">The foregoing establishes to our satisfaction that \u00a7 39M is designed to obtain the lowest price that competition among reasonable bidders can secure for contracts involving the actual physical \u201cconstruction\u201d (including reconstruction, alteration, maintenance, remodeling or repair) of public buildings and improvements on land owned by the Commonwealth or one of its subdivisions, and contracts for the materials that typically go into such construction projects. Acceptance of the plaintiff\u2019s interpretation of the statute \u2014 that any undertaking of any kind for a public purpose is a \u201cpublic work\u201d \u2014 would require us to blind ourselves to the entire statutory framework of c. 30, \u00a7\u00a7 39A through 39P, just discussed, and would necessitate casting aside as surplusage the words \u201cconstruction, reconstruction, alteration, remodeling or repair\u201d in the first sentence of \u00a7 39M. Their interpretation would also render largely meaningless the references throughout \u00a7 \u00a7 39A through 39P to matters commonly associated with building and construction projects such as the hiring of dump trucks, the need for architects and engineers to oversee the work, the requirement of security bonds, the procedures for prompt payment of subcontractors and materialmen, the provisions for equitable price adjustments for unanticipated site conditions, and the safeguards provided to ensure that the project\u2019s structural com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>ponents are durable and conforming to the contract specifications. It is axiomatic that a statute should be interpreted so as to give meaning to all the words in context; none of the words should be regarded as superfluous. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Woods Hole, Martha\u2019s Vineyard &amp; Nantucket S.S. Authy., </em>352 Mass. 617, 618 (1967). We hold that the cartographic project involved in this case is not subject to the provisions of G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 39M, but rather involves a contract whose award is left to the reasonable judgment of the municipal officers charged with the responsibility therefor.. No other contention has been raised to enable this case to withstand a 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss. The other arguments advanced by the plaintiffs, to show that in the public interest a requirement like that in \u00a7 39M should apply to municipal contracts for assessor\u2019s maps, are properly addressed to the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b175-6\">That statute provides in relevant part: \u201cEvery contract for the construction, reconstruction, alteration, remodeling or repair of any public work,- or for the purchase of any material, as hereinafter defined, by the commonwealth, or political subdivision thereof, or by any county, city, town, district, or housing authority, and estimated by the awarding authority to cost more than five thousand dollars in the case of the commonwealth, or political subdivision thereof, and more than two thousand dollars in the case of any other such awarding authority, shall be awarded to the lowest responsible and eligible bidder on the basis of competitive bids publicly opened and read by such awarding authority forthwith upon expiration of the time for the filing thereof; provided, however, that such awarding authority may reject any and all bids, if it is in the public interest so to do.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b176-5\"> The plaintiffs\u2019 reliance as stated in their brief is on that part of the definition of \u201cpublic works\u201d in Black\u2019s Law Dictionary which reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-6\">\u201cWorks, whether of construction or adaptation, undertaken and carried out by the national, state, or municipal authorities, and designed to subserve some purpose of public necessity, use, or convenience.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">From that definition they seem to argue that any project involving a public purpose is a \u201cpublic work.\u201d The quoted definition, however, although accurate enough, is only a part of the definition given in Black, bereft of its context. The quoted language appears as a subdivision of the word \u201cWorks,\u201d which, in so far as material, is defined as \u201ca building, structure, or erection of any kind <em>upon land\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied). Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1781 (4th ed. rev. 1968). The language quoted by the plaintiffs follows, under the subheading \u201cPublic Works.\u201d It is obvious, that the first of the words quoted, \u201cworks,\u201d restricts the subsequent langauge to \u201ca building, structure or erection . . . upon land.\u201d See now Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1440 (5th ed. 1979). Maps hardly fit that definition. Similarly, Webster defines \u201cpublic works\u201d as <em>\u201cfixed </em>works (as schools, highways, docks) constructed for public use or enjoyment . . . government sponsored public <em>improvements </em>(as parts or playgrounds)\u201d (emphasis supplied). Webster\u2019s Third New Inti. Dictionary 1836 (1971). Thus, both dictionary definitions restrict the term to things built on land, and those definitions are entitled to weight in construing the term. See G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 6, Third; <em>Moy </em>v. <em>Jack Madden Ford Sales, Inc., </em>4 Mass. App. Ct. 102, 105 (1976). Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>W. Barrington Co., </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. 416, 418-419 (1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
