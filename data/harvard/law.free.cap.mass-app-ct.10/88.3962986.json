The treasurer and owner of the balance of shares in the defendant corporation was A. Walter MacEachern. The defendant functioned as a manufacturer\u2019s representative and sold medical equipment. Patient monitoring devices which are used in intensive care units of hospitals were the principal products marketed by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-14\">Negotiations for the sale of the plaintiff\u2019s stock in the defendant and termination of his stewardship as an officer and director resulted in the signing of an agreement dated Janu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>ary 9, 1975, by the plaintiff and by MacEachern in behalf of the defendant. The salient provisions of the agreement concerned the following: the sale of the plaintiff\u2019s stock to the defendant; the payment of $1,200 per month for twelve months by the defendant to the plaintiff for his service as a consultant; the plaintiff\u2019s promise to refrain from engaging directly or indirectly as an employee or employer, or in any other capacity, in the business in which the defendant had been engaged in the New England area or in New York for the twelve months beginning January 31, 1975; and the defendant\u2019s assumption of certain bank obligations of the plaintiff incurred in the operation of the defendant\u2019s business. When the defendant\u2019s monthly payments stopped after the plaintiff had received $4,800, he brought this action. The defendant\u2019s answer included, inter alia, allegations of fraud, laches, waiver, and most importantly, violation of the plaintiff\u2019s covenant not to compete. The jury trial occupied two days and resulted in a verdict for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">The defendant\u2019s appeal raises essentially three issues: (1) the correctness of the judge\u2019s limitation on cross-examination of the plaintiff by defense counsel and the judge\u2019s gratuitous comments within the hearing of the jury as to the futility of such cross-examination as counsel was permitted to conduct; (2) the propriety of the judge\u2019s conduct throughout the trial in criticizing and interrupting the defendant\u2019s counsel; and (3) a ruling on the admissibility of evidence under the best evidence rule which is not likely to arise again in a new trial. While we deplore the conduct of the trial judge in his arbitrary treatment of counsel, we do not reach the second and third issues because we reverse on the first issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">The plaintiff went to work for General Electric Company (GE) on October 1, 1975, in its medical product division, which sold, among other products, patient monitoring equipment of a type which might be competitive with the defendant\u2019s products.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The plaintiff admitted that he helped the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>salesmen for GE sell its patient monitoring line within the prohibited period.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The plaintiff denies that there was any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>competition between the type of monitoring equipment with regard to which he was employed to help the salesmen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>and the type sold by the defendant. However, when counsel for the defendant started to pursue the precise nature of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>the product which the plaintiff sold or, at least aided other employees of GE to sell, the judge not only cut him short <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>but said that he was going nowhere in attempting to show the competitive nature of the product. His comments were audible to the jury. Apparently, the judge adopted the view that the defendant was required to prove that the plaintiff personally sold the competing products, that the type of monitoring equipment dealt with by the plaintiff was not in competition with the type sold by the defendant, and that the plaintiff\u2019s participation in training and working with salespersons who sold admittedly competing equipment fell outside the scope of the restrictive covenant. This was error. A jury could find that the relevant clause of the agreement was sufficiently broad to encompass activity of the type described by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">The extent of cross-examination is largely discretionary. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>369 Mass. 715, 731 (1976). However, the trial judge\u2019s discretion is not unbridled. See <em>Jennings </em>v. <em>Rooney, </em>183 Mass. 577, 579 (1903); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Franklin, </em>366 Mass. 284, 289-290 (1974). Crucial to the defendant\u2019s case was evidence that the plaintiff violated the noncompetition clause of the agreement. He should have been permitted to explore more fully and without judicial interruption this important sector. Compare <em>Ott </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Medicine, </em>276 Mass. 566, 574 (1931).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">The judge\u2019s comments as to the futility of the defendant\u2019s pursuit of the plaintiff\u2019s violation were not consistent with the judge\u2019s role as an impartial magistrate. See <em>Federal Natl. Bank </em>v. <em>O \u2019Keefe, </em>267 Mass. 75, 83 (1929). They constituted an invasion of the jury\u2019s fact finding function in violation of G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 81. The effect of these remarks may have been \u201cto throw the weight of the judge\u2019s opinion in the scales against the defendant.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Foran, </em>110 Mass. 179, 180 (1872). See <em>Olson </em>v. <em>Ela, </em>8 Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>App. Ct. 165, 167-169 (1979). The judge\u2019s final comment at this juncture, \u201cAll right, well, fine, that\u2019s for the jury to decide,\u201d does not purge the judge\u2019s earlier observation, \u201cYou\u2019re trying to show he was competing, and you\u2019re not getting any place. You\u2019re really not.\u201d More to the point, the judge gave no curative instruction to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b107-7\"> It is not at all clear whether the plaintiff sold equipment for GE in either New England or New York, the two areas denied the plaintiff in the agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b108-5\"> The following extract from the transcript reveals the material portion of the cross-examination of the plaintiff.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-6\">Q Tell us what the patient monitoring equipment is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-7\">The Court. Would you please tell us what relevance it has to anything?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-8\">Counsel for the Defendant. Yes, your Honor. In Paragraph 4 it says that he will refrain from engaging in competition with the defendant, and I have a deposition from his employer, General Electric, who says in fact he was selling, \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-9\">The Court. No, no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-10\">Counsel for the Defendant. You asked me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-11\">The Court. Ask him what he did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-12\">Q Sir\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-13\">The Court. When did you work at General Electric, sir? When did you work for. General Electric?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-14\">The Witness. I started employment with them in October \u2014 October 1, 1975.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-15\">Q And when you worked \u2014 General Electric has various divisions?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-16\">A That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-17\">Q One of them is their Medical Products Division?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-18\">A That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-19\">Q You worked in Medical Products Division?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-20\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-21\">Q You were what they call a PDS specialist?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-22\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-23\">Q And a PDS specialist is someone who is involved in various types of monitoring equipment, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-24\">A Various types, that\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-25\">Q As a matter of fact, General Electric, the division that you were work-for, approximately 70 per cent of the business done by your division was done in connection with the \u2014 excuse me \u2014 let me get the term correct \u2014 standard monitoring equipment, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-26\">A 70 percent of the business of G.E. Medical Division is standard mon-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-27\">itoring equipment, is that what you\u2019re asking me?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-28\">The Court. That\u2019s what he\u2019s asking you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-29\">A No, that\u2019s not correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-30\">Q Is the bulk of sales \u2014 was the bulk of sales in your division \u2014 and by your division I mean that division in which you were employed and your superior was William Sutton \u2014 is it fair to say that the bulk of your sales was in the standard monitoring line?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A2j\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>A Well, to get it straight, the bulk of the sales of the Medical Division was X-ray equipment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-6\">Q Would you say \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-7\">The Court. All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-8\">Q What I\u2019m asking you, sir, is it fair to say that the bulk of sales is the standard monitoring line?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-9\">The Court. He said it was in X-ray equipment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-10\">Counsel for the Defendant , I don\u2019t know if x-ray equipment is part of that \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-11\">Q \u2014 can you tell us?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-12\">A X-ray equipment is the largest part of that Medical Division \u2014 of General Electric.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-13\">Q X-ray equipment is included in what I said is the standard monitoring line, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-14\">The Court. How could X-ray equipment be monitoring equipment? I don\u2019t understand that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-15\">A This is kind of a technical question. If I can elaborate, I can probably clear it up a little bit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-16\">Q Go ahead, elaborate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-17\">A I was PDS specialist. I did not directly sell monitoring equipment. I only handled their PDS line. Now, their PDS line is maybe only 20 to 30 per cent of the monitoring line of equipment. I did not work with their standard monitoring equipment. I came in and helped salesmen when they got involved with large computerized patient management systems. I was working with the computerized patient management systems as a PDS specialist \u2014 trained and worked with salesmen.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-18\">Q Did those \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-19\">A To aid them in selling.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-20\">Q Selling systems \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-21\">A They sold monitoring equipment also.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-22\">Q Isn\u2019t it true \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-23\">A They sold x-ray equipment also.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-24\">Q Isn\u2019t it true that that standard monitoring equipment in which you were involved with the salesmen was in direct competition with the Spacelabs equipment, namely, the Alpha line that Medical Parameters was selling?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-25\">A Absolutely not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-26\">Q Well, if I \u2014 does the standard monitoring equipment do essentially the same thing as the Spacelabs standard monitoring line does?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-27\">A It does it in a more sophisticated, elaborate way.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ab\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>Q The word I used was \u201cessentially\u201d, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-6\">A Essentially monitors but also stores a lot of equipment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-7\">Q Isn\u2019t it true, sir, that Spacelabs is a direct competitor with General Electric for whom \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-8\">A For their standard monitoring equipment, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-9\">Q And the people over whom you had supervisory capacity were selling that equipment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-10\">A I never had supervisory capacity over them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-11\">Q The salesmen with whom you dealt, who were selling G.E. equipment, sold standard monitoring equipment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-12\">A Yes, they did. G.E. has many lines of equipment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-13\">The Court. All right, he\u2019s not getting anywhere with this \u2014 absolutely not, \u2014 trying to compare General Electric with Medical Parameters.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-14\">Q Is it your testimony, sir, that General Electric did not compete with Medical Parameters, Inc., in connection with the standard monitoring equipment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-15\">The Court. So what if they did? He said they did compete, but so what? He said he didn\u2019t compete.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-16\">Counsel for the Defendant. He said that his salesmen, the people he dealt with, did sell it and \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-17\">The Court. So what? That doesn\u2019t make any difference with him. I instruct the jury it doesn\u2019t make any difference. You\u2019ve got to show that he, personally, competed \u2014 not the General Electric.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-18\">Q Did you help support those people who sold equipment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-19\">A Yes, but only for PDS equipment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-20\">The Court. That\u2019s what he said before, which has nothing to do with monitoring equipment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-21\">Q Is it your testimony that the PDS equipment is different than the standard monitoring line?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-22\">A Very much so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-23\">Q Tell us how.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-24\">A Well, No 1, the cost of the equipment \u2014 it ranges from upwards to $50,000.00 per bed, per installation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-25\">The Court. As opposed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-26\">A As opposed to Seven to Ten Thousand Dollars per bed for the Space-labs equipment. The big difference is that it incorporates a data computerized system. There is a terminal keyboard which displays all sorts of information which can be tracked, and on a critically ill patient, can be stored for follow up by the physician. It\u2019s a totally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>different \u2014 it is a totally more sophisticated type of system. People who would be a candidate for that, probably would not be a candidate for standard monitoring equipment. If the choice were made by the customer to go with the computerized system, it would no longer be computerized on a standard monitoring basis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-6\">Q Did you deal directly with customers who would be interested in purchasing the standard line of PDS equipment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-7\">The Court. He said that he didn\u2019t have anything to do with the standard line.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-8\">A I did not deal with the standard line. They had pacemakers \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-9\">The Court. All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-10\">Q The salesmen with home [sic] you worked, did they go out to sell PDS equipment as well?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-11\">The Court. Come on, let\u2019s get off that. So what if they did?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-12\">A They sold every line \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-13\">The Court. Please, you don\u2019t have to answer. All right, anything else?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-15\">Counsel for the Defendant. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-16\">Q Did the people with whom you worked, the sales people, sell \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-17\">The Court. I told you not to ask the question because it\u2019s irrelevant as far as I\u2019m concerned.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-18\">Counsel for the Defendant. No, it isn\u2019t. May I be heard at the bench?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-19\">The Court. No, you may not. You may object but I\u2019m telling you to stop. Is it clear?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-20\">Counsel for the Defendant. No, your Honor, it isn\u2019t. I would like to put it on the record as to the basis of my objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-21\">The Court. I\u2019m not going to let you put the basis of your objection on the record. I\u2019m the one who is objecting. You\u2019re not objecting.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-22\">Counsel for the Defendant. May I ask the court the reasons?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-23\">The Court. I said it\u2019s irrelevant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-24\">Counsel for the Defendant. May I tell the court at the side bar the relevancy?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-25\">The Court. No</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-26\">Counsel for the Defendant. May I tell the court the materiality?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-27\">The Court. No. It\u2019s so obvious that you don\u2019t need to tell me. You\u2019re trying to show he was competing, and you\u2019re not getting any place. You\u2019re really not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AbJ\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>Counsel for the Defendant. I object to the court\u2019s comments. I think that\u2019s for the jury to decide.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-8\">The Court. All right, well fine, that\u2019s for the jury to decide. Anything else?
