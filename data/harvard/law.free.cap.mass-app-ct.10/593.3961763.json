L. c. 231A that its establishment and maintenance of two satellite health clinics without having first obtained from the defendant (Department) a \u201cdetermination of need\u201d (DON) and licenses for them, or a modification of the plaintiff\u2019s license to include the clinics, is in violation ofG.L.c. 111, \u00a7 25C, as amended through St. 1977, c. 945, \u00a7\u00a7 3, 4, and G. L. c. 111, \u00a7 51, as amended by St. 1977, c. 868, \u00a7 1, and the Department\u2019s regulations promulgated pursuant toG.L.c. 111, \u00a7 25F, as amended by St. 1977, c. 945, \u00a7 5. We affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>Section 51 provides that an original license to establish or maintain a hospital or clinic shall not be issued \u201cunless there is determination by the department that there is need for such a facility at the designated location,\u201d that such a license shall have a term of two years, and that it may be renewed \u201cfor like terms.\u201d An original license is \u201ca license issued to a hospital. . . or clinic, not previously licensed; or a license issued to an existing hospital... or clinic, in which there has been a change in ownership or location.\u201d G. L. c. 111, \u00a7 52, as amended by St. 1979, c. 674, \u00a7 1. The plaintiff is licensed under \u00a7 51, and it is located in Palmer. The satellite clinics were established in Monson and Wilbraham. The plaintiff maintains that it was not necessary for either clinic to obtain a DON or a license under \u00a7 51 because the Legislature has expressly defined a \u201cclinic\u201d to exclude \u201ca clinic conducted by a hospital licensed under section fifty-one.\u201d G. L. c. 111, \u00a7 52. It contends that because it runs the clinics, they have a statutorily permissible umbilical relationship with the mother hospital which allows them to exist on its license, thereby making individual licenses unnecessary. The definitional exclusion set out in \u00a7 52 must be read with \u00a7 51 \u201cso that the enactment considered as a whole shall constitute a consistent and harmonious statutory provision capable of effectuating the presumed intention of the Legislature.\u201d <em>Bolster </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxn., </em>319 Mass. 81, 84-85 (1946). See Sands, Sutherland Statutory Construction \u00a7 46.05, at 56-57 (4th ed. 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">Section 51 restricts the scope of a license issued to a hospital based upon a DON: \u201cThe license shall not be transferable and shall be issued only for the premises described in the application.\u201d Consistent with this restriction, the Department\u2019s promulgated definition of a \u201clicense\u201d reads: \u201ca permit from the Department . . . authorizing the maintenance of a health care facility by the person named therein and at the premises named therein.\u201d 105 Code Mass. Regs. 100.038 (1979).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>read this limitation as requiring that a hospital-run clinic which is to be situated on premises separate and apart from the hospital must hold an individual license from the Department pursuant to \u00a7 51, or the parent hospital must obtain an amendment to its license to include the off-premises clinic. Our conclusion is not only in harmony with the clear language of \u00a7 51, it is supported by the Department\u2019s definition of a DON which is \u201cthe formal decision of the Department . . . relative to the need for the project proposed in an application.\u201d 105 Code Mass. Regs. 100.032 (1979). A project includes the \u201cestablishment of a . . . clinic, subject to determination of need under G. L. c. 111, \u00a7 51, 2nd par.\u201d 105 Code Mass. Regs. 100.043 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">Further, the establishment of these clinics constitutes a substantial change in the plaintiff s services. Section 25C, as amended, precludes any health care facility from making a substantial change in services without a determination by the Department \u201cthat there is need therefor.\u201d This provision is inapplicable to \u201cany change in services provided by a hospital to persons who are not admitted as inpatients, which does not involve a substantial capital expenditure.\u201d \u00a7 25B.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, the plaintiff\u2019s clinics do not fall within this exclusion. A \u201csubstantial change in services\u201d is \u201ca change in kind, rather than degree, of service as further defined by the department.\u201d \u00a7 25B. The Department has defined substantial change in services, in relevant portion, to include \u201cthe establishment of a satellite clinic or unit of a facility\u201d and to exclude any change in the ambulatory services rendered at the parent hospital. 105 Code Mass. Regs. 100.054 (A) (1) and (2) (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">These statutory and regulatory provisions prevent hospitals from bypassing the scrutiny of the Department when expanding their services through the establishment of off-premises clinics. The provisions are entirely consistent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>with each other and with the legislative intention \u201c[t]o prevent unnecessary expansion of health care facilities in the Commonwealth and encourage appropriate allocation of resources for health care purposes.\u201d <em>Commissioner of Pub. Health </em>v. <em>Bessie M. Burke Memorial Hosp., </em>366 Mass. 734, 735 (1975). See <em>Mercy Hosp. </em>v. <em>Rate Setting Commn., </em>381 Mass. 34, 39-40 (1980); <em>Brookline </em>v. <em>Medical Area Serv. Corp., </em>8 Mass. App. Ct. 243, 249-252 (1979). (\u201c[T]he Legislature reacted to public concern over rising costs of health care by considering regulatory cost control techniques for large capital investments by hospitals and other health care institutions\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">When the parties had completed their pleadings, all that remained for the judge to decide was whether the clinics could exist on the authority of the plaintiff s existing license or whether it was necessary for the plaintiff\u2019s clinics to obtain separate licenses based upon a DON for the clinics. The judge decided these questions of law adversely to the plaintiff, and no material fact was in dispute.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The case was properly disposed of by a motion under rule 12 (c). See <em>Canter </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Westborough, </em>7 Mass. App. Ct. 805, 808 (1979). Moreover, the judgment stated with specificity that the plaintiffs actions were in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 25C and 51, and it declared the rights of the parties so that the controversy was resolved with finality. See <em>Boston </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Authy., </em>373 Mass. 819, 829 (1977). Compare <em>Brookline </em>v. <em>Medical Area Serv. Corp., 8 </em>Mass. App. Ct. at 259.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b612-6\"> For convenience we refer to the current codification of the Department\u2019s pertinent regulations, which have remained unchanged in substance throughout the period here relevant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b613-7\"> Statute 1977, c. 945, \u00a7 2, amended the definition of substantial capital expediture to be an amount in excess of one hundred and fifty thousand dollars.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b614-7\"><em> </em>While the pleadings show a factual dispute as to whether the plaintiff did in fact seek an exemption from the DON and license requirements for the clinics, see 105 Code Mass. Regs. 100.308 (1979), the dispute is immaterial to the controversy. The plaintiff has never alleged that the Department granted the exemption prior to the establishment of the clinics; rather, it suggests that the application for an exemption gave the Department notice that the clinics would be established. That is insufficient.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
