Antelman. The defendants answered and pleaded, among other defenses, that the action was time-barred under G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 2A. The action was eventually dismissed under Mass.R.Civ.P. 56(b), 365 Mass. 824 (1974). The defendants seasonably filed a motion under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6F, inserted by St. 1976, c. 233, \u00a7 1, for an award of counsel fees and expenses in connection with the defense of the action. That motion was heard and denied by a judge of the Superior Court other than the one by whose order the action had been dismissed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">The defendants filed a timely notice of appeal to a single justice of this court under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6G, also inserted by St. 1976, c. 233, \u00a7 1. The appeal was heard and determined on the original papers and the arguments of counsel. The single justice entered an order by which he awarded the defendants the sum of $2,248.77 by way of counsel fees and expenses in connection with the defense of the action in the Superior Court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Within thirty days of the date of the award the plaintiff filed a notice of appeal therefrom to a panel of the Justices of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">We deal first with certain questions which arise out of some of the obscurities in the provisions of G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6C.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-7\">1. The first question, one which we raised on our own motion at the argument, is whether the award of the single justice is reviewable by a panel of the Justices of this court. The second paragraph of Rule 2:01 of the Appeals Court, as amended, 3 Mass. App. Ct. 806 (1975), does not apply because a single jiistice of the Supreme Judicial Court has no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>jurisdiction to determine an appeal from a decision under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6F, unless he transfers the appeal to that court under the last paragraph of G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 4A. Although the second paragraph of \u00a7 6G, which is concerned with procedural matters, speaks of \u201c[a]ny appeal to . . . the appeals court,\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the only express grants of appellate jurisdiction are found in the first paragraph of the same section, which speaks of (1) an \u201cappeal... to the single justice of the appeals court\u201d with respect to a \u201cmatter [which] arises in the superior, land, housing or probate court\u201d and (2) an \u201cappeal... to the full bench of the supreme judicial court\u201d with respect to a \u201cmatter [which] arises in the appeals court or before a single justice of the supreme judicial court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">On the other hand, there is nothing in \u00a7 6G which purports to attribute any measure of finality to an order entered by one of our single justices under that section. Contrast G. L. c. 261, \u00a7 27D, as originally inserted by St. 1974, c. 694, \u00a7 3, and as now appearing in St. 1980, c. 539, \u00a7 8, which has always provided that a decision by one of our single justices on costs for an indigent party \u201cshall be final.\u201d Any conclusion by us that one of our panels could not review an order entered by one of our single justices under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6G, would lead to a practice under which persistent counsel would take those orders by complaints in the nature of certiorari (G. L. c. 249, \u00a7 4, as appearing in St. 1973, c. 1114, \u00a7 289) to the single justices of the Supreme Judicial Court, who could not transfer the cases elsewhere under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 4A, and whose judgments would be subject to still further appeal under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 114, as appearing in St. 1973, c. 1114, \u00a7 202.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">We have recently said that the \u201cunnecessary traditional baggage\u201d of certiorari <em>(Loring Hills Developers Trust </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Salem, </em>374 Mass. 343, 350 [1978]) should be dispensed with \u201cwhen[ever] another and simpler means of securing judicial review is adequate and available.\u201d <em>Do</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number><em>herty </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Boston, </em>6 Mass. App. Ct. 805, 811-812 (1979). The panels of this court are quite capable of eradicating the sins of our single justices (see, e.g., <em>John Donnelly &amp; Sons </em>v. <em>Outdoor Advertising Bd., </em>4 Mass. App. Ct. 847 [1976]; <em>Cassidy </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Environmental Management, </em>7 Mass. App. Ct. 898, 899 [1979]; <em>Pemberton </em>v. <em>Pemberton, </em>9 Mass. App. Ct. 809 [1980]; <em>Greenberg </em>v. <em>Greenberg, post </em>827, 828 [1980]; <em>Ward v. Coletti, ante </em>629, 632-633 [1980]), and it would hardly serve the purpose for which this court was created for us to throw the orders entered by our single justices under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6G, into the Supreme Judicial Court. We think that sound principles of judicial administration dictate the conclusion that such orders are reviewable by a panel of this court, subject to the possibility of further appellate review under G. L. c. 211A, \u00a7 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">We believe, however, that appeals from orders by the single justices under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6G, should be stayed until the entry in this court of any appeal from the final judgment which may ultimately be entered in the lower court, or until such time as it becomes apparent that there will be no such appeal.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The first and last paragraphs of G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6F, contemplate that interlocutory orders may be entered under that section. The last sentence of \u00a7 6G provides that the payment of any award under \u00a7 6F \u201cshall be stayed until the completion of all appeals relating to the civil action in which the award was made.\u201d And the possibility always exists that the disposition of the appeal from the final judgment may undermine or obliterate the basis for an order entered in the lower court under \u00a7 6F or in this court under \u00a7 6G. It is only by staying the appeal from the order of a single justice for the period indicated that we can avoid the evils of piecemeal appellate review. See <em>Giacobbe </em>v. <em>First Coolidge Corp., </em>367 Mass. 309, 312-313 (1975); <em>Kargman </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>371 Mass. 324, 329-330 (1976); <em>Cappadona </em>v. <em>Riverside 400 Function Room, Inc., </em>372 Mass. 167, 169 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">2. The defendants urge in their brief before us that we should decline to hear the present appeal because it was not claimed within the ten-day period provided in the first sentence of the second paragraph of \u00a7 6G. As we read that paragraph, the ten-day period applies (in a case such as the present) only to an appeal to a single justice from a decision on a \u201cmatter [which] arises in the superior, land, housing or probate court,\u201d as provided for in the second sentence of the first paragraph of \u00a7 6G. No time limit is expressly set on an appeal from an order of a single justice, but the third sentence of the second paragraph of \u00a7 6G provides that \u201c[a]ny appeal to . . . the appeals court<footnotemark>[6]</footnotemark> . . . shall proceed according to the Massachusetts Rules of Appellate Procedure.\u201d That provision has the effect of invoking the thirty- and sixty-day appeal periods found in Mass.R.A.P. 4(a), as amended, 378 Mass. 928 (1979) (compare <em>Boston Seamans Friend Soc. </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>379 Mass. 414, 416 [1980]), with the result that the plaintiff\u2019s appeal from the award of the single justice, which was claimed within thirty days, is properly here.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-6\">3. Also discussed at the argument, but not in the briefs of the parties, was the question whether the single justice has the power to make an award which has been denied by the lower court. The words \u201creview the finding\u201d and the words \u201cwithdraw or amend any finding or reduce or rescind any award\u201d which appear in the last sentence of the first paragraph of \u00a7 6G do not aptly describe what has occurred in the present case. However, the first sentence of that section affords a right of appeal to the single justice to <em>\u201c[a]ny </em>party aggrieved by a decision on a motion pursuant to\u201d \u00a7 6F, and the third sentence of that section contemplates that the appeal may be from the denial of an award when it states that what the single justice is to \u201creview\u201d are the \u201cfinding and award, <em>if any, </em>appealed from\u201d (emphasis supplied). Ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>cordingly, we have no hesitation in concluding that the single justice has the power to make an award which has been sought and denied in the lower court.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">4. We need not dwell at length on the merits of the present appeal. The plaintiff s response to a notice of the taking of his deposition was to file a groundless motion to disqualify the defendants\u2019 counsel which the plaintiff pursued without success in the Superior Court and in the single justice sessions of this court and the Supreme Judicial Court. When finally brought to bay on deposition, the plaintiff was either unable or unwilling to give a coherent explanation of the contractual relationship with Antelman which had allegedly been interfered with, and his testimony was such as to require the conclusion that the allegations of the complaint under which he had hoped to escape the operation of the statute of limitations were false. It is clear from the papers that when the action was brought, neither the plaintiff nor his counsel had had any reason to believe that any of the defendants was even aware of any contractual relationship between the plaintiff and Antelman (see <em>Grammenos </em>v. <em>Zolotas, </em>356 Mass. 594, 597 [1970]; <em>National Right to Life Convention \u201976, Inc. </em>v. <em>Million Dollar Round Table, </em>6 Mass. App. Ct. 857 [1978]), with the result that there had been no factual support for the allegation in the complaint that the \u201cdefendants did intentionally interfere with the performance of this said contract.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Shortly after the completion of the deposition the plaintiff caused the action to be dismissed with prejudice as to one of the defendants, for no apparent reason. The plaintiff s appeal from the judgment of the Superior Court had been dismissed for lack of prosecution by the time the single justice acted. He was clearly correct in concluding that the plaintiff s claim was \u201cwholly insubstantial, frivolous and not advanced in good faith\u201d within the meaning of G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6F. The same is true of the present appeal, in which the plaintiff s counsel has ar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>gued only that her client\u2019s claim was not frivolous and was advanced in good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">The order and award of the single justice are affirmed, with counsel fees to the defendants on this appeal in the amount of $1,800 (see <em>Goodwin Bros. Leasing </em>v. <em>Nousis, </em>373 Mass. 169, 177 [1977]<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>) and double costs on appeal (G. L. c. 211A, \u00a7 15), including in such costs the cost of the supplemental appendix filed by the defendants pursuant to leave of court first obtained; the execution is to issue out of the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b811-8\"> We disapprove of such a practice whenever the proper resolution of a motion under \u00a7 6F requires an assessment of the credibility of witnesses.
