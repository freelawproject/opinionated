L. c. 41, \u00a7 81BB) by the planning board of Harwich (board) from a judgment annulling its decision refusing an endorsement under G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81P,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that \u201capproval under the subdivision control <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>law [was] not required\u201d (a \u00a7 81P endorsement) on a plan submitted on March 20, 1978, by the plaintiff, dividing into two lots a tract of land which she owns in Harwichport (locus). (The board filed its decision of refusal with the town clerk on March 24, 1978.) The judgment also declared that the owner was entitled to the endorsement. The case was tried on a \u201cStatement of Agreed Facts,\u201d including various exhibits from which the following appears. The locus consists of 34,925 square feet on which there are two buildings, a residence and a barn. Of the two lots shown on the plan, one has an area of 14,897 square feet and includes the residence; the other has an area of 20,028 square feet and includes the barn. Both structures were standing when the Subdivision Control Law went into effect in Harwich, and each of the lots shown on the plan has frontage on a public way greater than the 100-foot minimum frontage required by the Harwich zoning by-law. See definition of \u201csubdivision\u201d in G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81L,* <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> clauses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>designated [2], [3], and [4]. However, the zoning by-law requires a minimum area of 20,000 square feet for any use other than a guest house,* *<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> so that the smaller lot of 14,897 square feet containing the residence does not conform to the area requirements of the by-law. The plan also indicates violations of the sideline requirements of the zoning by-law.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">The board contends that the zoning violations indicated on the plan justify its decision to withhold a \u00a7 81P endorsement. It points to G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81M, which sets out the general purpose of the subdivision control law and declares that \u201c[ t]he powers of a planning board . . . under the subdivision control law shall be exercised with due regard . . . for insuring compliance with the applicable zoning ordinances or by-laws . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>In view of the legislative history and judicial interpretation of \u00a7 8IP, we do not read that section to place the same duties and responsibilities on the board as it has when it is called upon to approve a subdivision. Compare G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81U; <em>Doliner </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Millis, </em>343 Mass. 1, 6 (1961). Provision for an endorsement that approval was not required first appeared in 1953, when \u00a7 81P was enacted. St. 1953, c. 674, \u00a7 7. Theretofore plans not requiring approval by a planning board could be lawfully recorded without reference to the planning board. The purpose of \u00a7 81P, as explained by Mr. Philip Nichols on behalf of the sponsors of the 1953 legislation, was to alleviate the \u201cdifficulty . . . encountered by registers of deeds in deciding whether a plan showing ways and lots could lawfully be recorded.\u201d 1953 House Doc. No. 2249, at 55. The entire explanation is illuminating and is set out in the margin.* ***<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>This purpose is manifested in the insertion by St. 1953, c. 674, \u00a7 7, of G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81X, which provided \u2014 as it now provides \u2014 that: \u201cNo register of deeds shall record any plan showing a division of a tract of land into two or more lots, and ways, . . . unless (1) such plan bears an endorsement of the planning board of such city or town that such plan has been approved by such planning board, ... or (2) such plan bears an endorsement ... as provided in [\u00a7 81P].\u201d See 1953 House Doc. No. 2249, at 59. See also 1954 Ann. Survey Mass. Law \u00a7 2.7; Johnson, Note on the New Subdivision Control Law, 38 Mass.L.Q. (No. 4) 13 (1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">Thus \u00a7 8 IP was not intended to enlarge the substantive powers of the board but rather to provide a simple method to inform the register that the board was not concerned with the plan \u2014 to \u201crelieve [ ] certain divisions of land of regulation and approval by a planning board (\u2018approval . . . not required\u2019) . . . because the vital access is reasonably guaranteed . . . .\u201d <em>Gifford </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Nantucket, </em>376 Mass. 801, 807 (1978).* ***<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thus, we have held that a \u00a7 81P endorsement \u201cgives the lots no standing under the zoning ordinance.\u201d <em>Gattozzi </em>v. <em>Director of Inspection Servs. of Melrose, </em>6 Mass. App. Ct. 889 (1978), citing <em>Alley </em>v. <em>Building Inspector of Danvers, </em>354 Mass. 6, 7-8 (1968). See <em>Goldman </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Burlington, </em>347 Mass. 320, 324 (1964); <em>Giovannucci </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Plainville, 4 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 239, 243 (1976). The generally routine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>nature of a \u00a7 8 IP endorsement is further indicated by the provision in \u00a7 8 IP that such an endorsement be made \u201cforthwith, without a public hearing.\u201d It is also emphasized by St. 1961, c. 332, which adds the provision: \u201cSuch endorsement shall not be withheld unless such plan shows a subdivision.\u201d (See n.l.) Further, were we to accept the defendant\u2019s contention that a planning board has a responsibility with reference to zoning when making a \u00a7 8 IP endorsement, it would imply a similar responsibility with reference to the other considerations in \u00a7 81M (see n.4), not only \u201cfor insuring compliance with the applicable zoning [laws]\u201d but \u201cfor securing adequate provision for water, sewerage, drainage, underground utility services,\u201d etc. A \u00a7 81P endorsement is obviously not a declaration that these matters are in any way satisfactory to the planning board. In acting under \u00a7 8IP, a planning board\u2019s judgment is confined to determining whether a plan shows a subdivision.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">Nor can we say that the recording of a plan showing a zoning violation, as this one does, can serve no legitimate purpose. The recording of a plan such as the plaintiff\u2019s may be preliminary to an attempt to obtain a variance, or to buy abutting land which would bring the lot into compliance, or even to sell the nonconforming lot to an abutter and in that way bring it into compliance. In any event, nothing that we say here in any way precludes the enforcement of the zoning by-law should the recording of her plan eventuate in a violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">The board also argues that the phrase \u201cused, or available for use\u201d in the definition of \u201clot\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> refers to a lot meeting the zoning requirements. From that it concludes that the two exclusions from the definition of \u201csubdivision\u201d (see n.2, clauses [2], [3], and [4]) on which the plaintiff relies for a \u00a7 81P endorsement have no application because they both refer to lots meeting the zoning requirements. The argu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>ment is without merit. The short answer is that it is self-defeating. If a nonconforming \u201clot\u201d takes a plan out of the exceptions to a subdivision it must also take it out of the definition of \u201csubdivision\u201d itself: \u2014 \u201cthe division of a tract of land into two or more lots\u201d (emphasis supplied). G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81L (see n.2, cl. [1]). See <em>Bloom </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Brookline, </em>346 Mass. 278, 283-284 (1963). But as we have indicated above, if this plan does not create a subdivision within \u00a7 81L, it is entitled to an endorsement under the second sentence of \u00a7 81P inserted by St. 1961, c. 332. In any event the defendant points to nothing to indicate that the definition of \u201clot\u201d sets out anything but physical characteristics rather than zoning limitations. Indeed, it appears that this argument is a mere afterthought, for the statement of agreed facts uses the word \u201clot\u201d without reference to whether it conforms to a zoning by-law.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">We therefore affirm the judgment. In this connection we note that the lower court has retained jurisdiction though so far as appears nothing remains to be done but to place a \u00a7 8IP endorsement on the plan in accordance with the judgment. Judgment is thus sufficiently final to warrant our review. <em>Cape Ann Land Dev. Corp. </em>v. <em>Gloucester, </em>371 Mass. 19, 25 n.8 (1976). We cannot say that the retention of jurisdiction (which the parties do not argue) was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b617-14\"> General Laws c. 41, \u00a7 81P, as appearing in St. 1963, c. 363, \u00a7 1, provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-15\">\u201cAny person wishing to cause to be recorded a plan of land situated in a city or town in which the subdivision control law is in effect, who believes that his plan does not require approval under the subdivision control law, may submit his plan to the planning board of such city or town in the manner prescribed in section eighty-one T, and, if the board finds that the plan does not require such approval, it shall forthwith, without a public hearing, endorse thereon or cause to be endorsed thereon by a person authorized by it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>the words \u2018approval under the subdivision control law not required\u2019 or words of similar import ....

It is the intent of the subdivision control law that any subdivision plan filed with the planning board shall receive the approval of such board if said plan conforms to the recommendation of the board of health and to the reasonable rules and regulations of the planning board pertaining to subdivisions of land; provided, however, that such board may, when appropriate, waive, as provided for in section eighty-one R, such portions of the rules and regulations as is deemed advisable.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b620-9\"> \u201cSection 81P is entirely new.
