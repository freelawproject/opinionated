RSA 77:5; Laws 1951, <em>c. </em>222, <em>s. </em>1. While any exemption produces a theoretical inequality in the tax burden, it is recognized that the legislative power to tax is usually based on the proposition \u201cthat the equality sought is a practical one.\u201d <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>82 N. H. 561, 570. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>The power of the Legislature to grant a reasonable exemption in the interest and dividends tax is not doubtful. <em>Conner </em>v. <em>State, </em>82 N. H. 126, 128; <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>81 N. H. 563, 564; <em>Sagendorph </em>v. <em>Marvin, </em>101 N. H. 79, 81.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">The pending bill proposes to grant an additional exemption of $400 from the interest and dividends income to those persons who are sixty-five years or older. \u201cIn the selective process of classifying certain property for taxation and exempting other property the Legislature has a wide discretion which will be sustained \u2018providing just reasons exist for the selection made.\u2019\u201d <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>95 N. H. 548, 550. While, of course, age and poverty are by no means synonymous, the Legislature and the courts have recognized that in many cases they may have some common attributes. See <em>Briggs' Petition, </em>29 N. H. 547, 552-553. <em>Cocheco Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>Strafford, </em>51 N. H. 455, 459. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Railway, </em>84 N. H. 313, 315, it was stated that \u201cpoverty and misfortune have long been regarded as just grounds of relief\u201d for the abatement of taxes. See Kauper, Constitutional Uniformity and Equality in State Taxation 192 (1959). Under RSA 167:6(a) a person is \u201celigible for old age assistance who is sixty-five years of age\u201d and the same age limit applies to \u201cmedical assistance to the aged.\u201d RSA 167:6(g) (supp); Laws 1961, 271:3. Neither poll taxes nor head taxes are assessed against those over seventy years of age. RSA 72:1; Laws 1961, 43:1. Today retirement at sixty-five years of age is common in both private and public employment. RSA 100:6 (supp); RSA 102:13 (supp); RSA 192:5. The tax imposed by RSA, chapter 77 is a tax upon income from sources other than earnings. We cannot say that the legislative power to grant an additional exemption to those who have reached the age of sixty-five years as proposed in Senate Bill 55 is unreasonable or that it is a taxable classification which violates the state Constitution. <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>95 N. H. 540, 542; <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>84 N. H. 559, 571-572.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">Your third inquiry is whether the \u201ctotally disabled\u201d may be granted an exemption from the payment of any tax under RSA ch. 77. Since these persons are eligible for special assistance (RSA 167:6(f)) and presumably will have no earned income, such disability may reasonably be considered a ground for exempting their unearned income from the tax under RSA chapter 77, and the Legislature has a just reason for granting an exemption by general law. See Briggs\u2019 <em>Petition, 29 </em>N. H. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>547; <em>State </em>v. Railway, 84 N. H. 313, 315; <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>101 N. H. 539, 540. Such an exemption is not in violation of the state Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\">The generality of your second question precludes any definitive answer and therefore we are unable to provide advice which would be of present assistance.</p>\n<judges id=\"b89-5\">Frank R.
