He claims that the only testimony introduced which could have shown that alcohol was a contributing cause of his injuries was given by the defendant\u2019s expert. Cross-examination of the defendant\u2019s expert disclosed that \u201canything over .15%, a man is prima facie under the influence.\u201d However this evidence to the effect that the plaintiff\u2019s blood test of .19 alcoholic content, indicated the consumption of over three quarts of beer was limited to the question of his credibility and could not be considered by the jury as bearing on his contributory negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">The difficulty with the plaintiff\u2019s position is that he fails to consider the fact that there was other testimony on this subject for the jury to weigh. It is not disputed that the plaintiff\u2019s blood test showed .19 of alcoholic content. By his own admission, he had drunk five glasses of ale at the home of a friend where he ate supper, shortly before leaving to walk to the scene of the accident. The defendant testified that he saw a bag in the plaintiff\u2019s hand as he lay along the right fender immediately after the collision. A police officer said that there was a bag containing beer lying beside the plaintiff when he arrived at the scene. Another officer who investigated the case also testified that \u201cthere was a bag of beer bottles beside the pedestrian.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">It appears that the parties were traveling in opposite directions in the same lane of travel and that the road was icy. The plaintiff himself, in describing the accident, said that he was walking on the side of the road, which was some thirty feet wide, looking down at his feet. He saw no sign of a car until \u201cthe lights flashed in my face\u201d and at practically the same instant, \u201cI was hit.\u201d It is undisputed that he had an unobstructed view of at least several hundred feet ahead in the direction from which the defendant\u2019s car was approaching and that the weather was clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">In all these circumstances, we believe that reasonable persons could conclude that the plaintiff\u2019s senses had been affected by the ale which he had consumed. The Court properly charged the jury that they should determine what the plaintiff\u2019s condition was as a result of drinking and if they found it to be causal of the accident they should return a verdict for the defendant. The exception to this instruction is therefore overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>However, the plaintiff claims that the Court\u2019s charge was misleading and that the jury might have understood that they could consider the expert\u2019s statement, that the plaintiff\u2019s blood test of .19 indicated consumption of more alcohol than the plaintiff admitted having had, as bearing direcdy on this issue. It appears that this position cannot be maintained. The record discloses that the Court clearly instructed the jury twice, when this testimony was introduced, that it was \u201climited to the credibility of the plaintiff.\u201d Again the Court specifically charged the jury that when evidence was admitted \u201cfor a limited purpose, you could only consider it for a limited purpose.\u201d It is to be presumed that the jury followed these instructions. <em>Whipple </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>90 N. H. 261. Furthermore, not only is the Court\u2019s finding that the jury was not misled and that the trial was fair, entitled to great weight <em>(McLaughlin </em>v. <em>Union-Leader, </em>99 N. H. 492, 499), hut an examination of the entire record convinces us that the jury could not have been misled. <em>Cf. West </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>81 N. H. 522, 531. It follows that the plaintiff\u2019s exception cannot prevail. <em>Lindberg </em>v. <em>Swenson, </em>95 N. H. 184, 187.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">His contention that the Presiding Justice erred in not allowing him more latitude in cross-examining the defendant\u2019s expert witness, who testified regarding the plaintiff\u2019s alcoholic blood content, does not require extended consideration. A lengthy cross-examination was permitted, and the record discloses no abuse in the limitation finally imposed. The Justice\u2019s discretionary exclusion is not reviewable here. <em>Laird </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>80 N. H. 377, 379.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">The plaintiff\u2019s further exception, on the ground that the blood test was not made pursuant to accepted or approved practices (see <em>State </em>v. <em>Reenstierna, </em>101 N. H. 286; <em>State </em>v. <em>Fornier, </em>103 N. H. 152), cannot be sustained. We believe the fair import of the agreement between counsel made in open court early in the trial, that the alcoholic content of the plaintiff\u2019s blood was .19 precludes him from later raising this objection. <em>Burtman </em>v. <em>Butman, </em>94 N. H. 412.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">A final issue urged by plaintiff\u2019s counsel is that he was not allowed to recall his client to testify a second time as to his drinking habits. This matter also is purely discretionary with the Court. <em>Coleman </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>103 N. H. 313, 318; <em>Constantine </em>v. <em>Grenier, </em>81 N. H. 550. The plaintiff had already stated on direct examination what his drinking habits were. No abuse of discretion appears in the Court\u2019s refusal to allow elaboration of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>this matter. The exception is accordingly overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"Asfs\">The order is</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">\n<em>Judgment on the verdict.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b343-5\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
