The unpaid balance of the purchase price was evidenced by the defendant\u2019s note in the sum of $12,160 payable in seventeen monthly installments of $676 each and a final installment of $668 commencing November 30, 1958, and excepting January, February and March. The note was endorsed to The First National Bank of Derry. It was secured by a duly recorded chattel mortgage of even date which was assigned to the bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-9\">The first payment due November 30, 1958 was defaulted but was paid by the defendant on January 23, 1959. The next four installments were also paid by the defendant after their due dates, the June 1959 installment having been paid on August 31, 1959.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-10\">On October 13, 1959, after credits of $3,380 by reason of payments by the defendant, the note and mortgage were reassigned to the plaintiff, the unpaid balance then being $8,780. The tractor was replevied on November 13, 1959.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-11\">On pre-trial the defendant denied signature of the mortgage and claimed fraud and misrepresentation in that \u201cthe defendant\u2019s agent was unaware that he was signing a note and mortgage but it was represented to him that he was signing nothing but a drop-off slip.\u201d The evidence at the trial related to this issue and the verdict of the jury decided it in the plaintiff\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-12\">On the second day of the trial the defendant\u2019s motion to amend <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>its answer to allege a breach by the plaintiff of certain warranties as to equipment and service on the tractor was denied subject to exception. The defendant points out that the pre-trial order stated: \u201cThe defendant says that it committed no breach and that the first breach was committed by the plaintiff.\u201d However no claim for damages by reason of any breach of warranty was pleaded or alleged by the defendant in advance of trial <em>( cf. Vernon Corp. </em>v. <em>Granite &amp;c. Co., </em>93 N. H. 315) and such a claim would not constitute a defense to the plaintiff\u2019s action unless it were sufficient to extinguish the debt and hence the plaintiff\u2019s right to possession. See Annot. 151 A.L.R. 519. The denial of the defendant\u2019s motion to amend its answer for the purpose of presenting such a claim after most of the plaintiff\u2019s case had been proved was within the discretion of the Trial Court. RSA514:9. See <em>LePage </em>v. <em>Company, </em>97 N. H. 46. The defendant\u2019s exception is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">The defendant asserts that it sought to \u201cput into evidence\u201d paragraph 12 of the pre-trial order which stated: \u201cOne question of law is that the defendant says the action has been brought in the wrong county.\u201d <em>Sleeper </em>v. <em>Osgood, </em>50 N. H. 331. It is not disputed that this issue was presented by motion in advance of trial, and that a change in venue from Hillsborough to Rockingham County was ordered. RSA 507:11.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">Evidence offered by the defendant with respect to the extent of the use which it made of the tractor before the replevy was excluded subject to exception. The record shows the agreement of the parties that in the event the issue of the plaintiff\u2019s right to possession should be determined in favor of the defendant, the defendant would thereafter be entitled to assessment of the damages caused it by replevy. See RSA 536:6. <em>Canney </em>v. <em>Emerson, </em>82 N. H. 487. Moreover, since the verdict of the jury was in favor of the plaintiff, the defendant is not entitled to judgment for the return of the tractor or for its value so it has suffered no prejudice from the exclusion. Its exception is accordingly overruled. See <em>Am. Steel Company </em>v. <em>Wooster, </em>95 N. H. 179; <em>Derry Loan &amp;c. Co. </em>v. <em>Falconer, </em>84 N. H. 450, 454.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">The defendant excepted to a ruling admitting in evidence certain records offered by the plaintiff for the purpose of showing that the defendant\u2019s treasurer was familiar with chattel mortgages. The defendant\u2019s only argument in support of this exception is based upon the fact that the records were produced in response to a subpoena issued by plaintiff\u2019s counsel as justice of the peace. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>action of plaintiffs counsel in issuing the subpoenas was authorized by statute. RSA 516:3. The contention is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">The defendant sought to introduce evidence concerning the whereabouts of the tractor at the time of trial, which was excluded subject to exception. This ruling was proper. \u201cWhat the plaintiff does with the property after its delivery to him has nothing to do with his cause of action.\u201d <em>Derry Loan &amp;c. Co. </em>v. <em>Falconer, </em>84 N. H. 450, <em>supra, </em>452. The question to which the evidence related was immaterial to the issue on trial. <em>Putnam </em>v. <em>Osgood, </em>52 N. H. 148.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">The argument of plaintiff\u2019s counsel to which exception was taken was a fair evaluation of the evidence and was properly permitted to stand. The defendant did not except to other argument referred to before us, and hence no issue regarding it is presented. <em>Bourget </em>v. <em>Company, </em>98 N. H. 237. Other exceptions by the defendant which appear in the record have been reviewed and are considered to present no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b92-7\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
