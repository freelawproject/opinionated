O'Neil, </em>Assistant Attorney General <em>{Mr. O'Neil </em>orally), for the State.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b79-14\"><em>William D. Tribble </em>and <em>David J.

H. 140; <em>State </em>v. <em>Mealey, </em>100 N. H. 228.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">The State concedes that while the offense charged could be more clearly set forth in the complaints, the allegation that the defendants were \u201c . . . guilty of disorderly conduct in that [they] did use profane words and engage in loud talk\u201d was sufficient to inform them that they were being prosecuted under the provisions of RSA 570:1, which provides in part: \u201cBrawls, etc. No person shall make a brawl, nor, in any street or other public place, be guilty of rude, indecent, or disorderly conduct . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">The charge is set forth in the words of the statute with the further specification of disorderly conduct that the defendants used \u201cprofane words and engaged in loud talk.\u201d We think this is sufficient to apprise the defendants that they were being prosecuted under RSA 570:1. <em>State </em>v. Perkins, 42 N. H. 464; <em>State </em>v. Rollins, 55 N. H. 101; <em>State </em>v. Harlan, 103 N. H. 31; <em>State </em>v. <em>Twarog, </em>97 N. H. 101; <em>cf. State </em>v. <em>Peirce, </em>43 N. H. 273.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">It should be noted that section 2 of this chapter prohibits addressing derisive words to another person upon any street and section 3 prohibits the utterance or writing of obscenity. The charge as drawn could not be fairly said to come within the purview of these sections.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-8\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b80-9\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
