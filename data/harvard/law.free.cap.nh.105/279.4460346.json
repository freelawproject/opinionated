The officers of both corporations are the same persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">Defendant investigated different types of such buildings and had plans prepared by an architect for that purpose. The negotiations which resulted in an agreement between the parties to this action were conducted by officers of the defendant with one Booth who at the time1 had been a commission agent for the plaintiff for about six months.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-9\">On October 3, 1960, Booth presented to the defendant, a detailed proposal on plaintiff\u2019s letterhead, to furnish a preengineered building to be erected by it on a foundation to be provided by the defendant. This proposal which referred to, specifications and drawings by defendant\u2019s architect had been signed by Alvan Shuman, president of H &amp; B Construction Co., when Booth gave it to the defendant. It was thereafter signed by John R. Irwin, an officer of James Irwin &amp; Sons, Inc., on its behaff.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-10\">Thereafter the defendant prepared a document entitled \u201cContract\u201d which covered substantially the same subject matter as plaintiff\u2019s proposal. The main difference was paragraph 9 of the \u201cContract\u201d which provided as follows: \u201cTime Limits. The contractor shall endeavor to complete the work under this contract on or before November 28, 1960. Any delay beyond November 28, 1960, shall give the owner the right to deduct the sum of Fifty ($50.00) dollars for each day\u2019s delay in com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>pletion.\u201d There was no such provision in the plaintiff's proposal.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">This \u201cContract\u201d was executed October 4, 1960 (the day after the date of plaintiffs proposal) by \u201cJames R. Irwin, Treas.\u201d on behalf of the defendant and by \u201cMorrison Booth, Agent\u201d in the name of H &amp; B Construction Company. At the same time defendant delivered to Booth with the signed \u201cContract\u201d a check for $2,000, the deposit called for by both the proposal and the \u201cContract.\u201d This check, also dated October 4, 1960, and the signed \u201cContract\u201d were taken by Booth directly to Shuman, president of the plaintiff corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">Plaintiff relies on the proposal of October 3, 1960, and had the burden of proving that it was accepted by the defendant and constituted the agreement determinative of the rights and obligations of the parties. <em>Maloney </em>v. <em>Company, </em>98 N. H. 78, 81, 82. It sought to recover a balance of $4,278 allegedly due it under the terms of this agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">Defendant relying on the \u201cContract\u201d of October 4, 1960, filed a set-off and counterclaim in the amount of $4,600 based on its \u201cTime Limits\u201d clause 9. To support its claim, defendant had the burden of proving that the rights and obligations of the parties were governed by this \u201cContract\u201d and that it was entitled to deduct $50 a day for 92 days of delay in its completion.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">The disputed question of fact regarding the existence and the terms of the agreement which is to govern the rights and obligations of these parties is to be determined by the trier of fact in accordance with the applicable law. <em>Maloney </em>v. <em>Company, supra, </em>82; <em>Perry </em>v. <em>Company, </em>99 N. H. 451, 453; 3 Am. Jur. 2d, Agency, <em>ss. </em>73, 76, 160, 178.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-9\">Defendant argues that since plaintiff in its declaration referred to a contract entered into by the parties \u201con or about October 4, 1960\u201d and used some language which could be found to relate to the \u201cContract\u201d rather than to the proposal, the master should have considered only such evidence as pertained to the \u201cContract\u201d and should have decided the case in accordance with its terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-10\">Where, as in this case, the contract involved is not recited <em>verbatim </em>in the declaration but is declared on according to its legal effect, a proposal agreed upon on October 3, 1960, can be proved under the allegation \u201con or about October 4, 1960\u201d as the date the contract was entered into. 41 Am. Jur., Pleadings, s. 379; 17A C. J. S., Contracts, <em>s. </em>575. Furthermore, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>proposal dated October 3, 1960, was admitted in evidence without objection by the defendant as was the testimony on which plaintiff relied to prove it was the contract between the parties. It has long been the rule that it is not our practice to spend time in the investigation of the accuracy of the pleadings after the action has without objection been fully tried by the parties. <em>LePage </em>v. Company, 97 N. H. 46, 50.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">The master found that the proposal of October 3, was an offer and there appeared to be no reason for an officer of the defendant to sign it except for the purpose of accepting plaintiff\u2019s offer. The master ruled that the defendant\u2019s signing constituted an acceptance and that a completed contract between the parties resulted.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">The description of the materials to be supplied and of the work to be performed by the plaintiff contained in the proposal is substantially the same as that contained in the \u201cContract.\u201d The total price to be paid by the defendant therefor and the various stages at which it was to be paid are described in substantially the same manner in both documents. Both refer to drawings by an architect dated September 6, 1960. There is no question that plaintiff\u2019s president, Alvan E. Shuman, was authorized to execute the proposal on behalf of the plaintiff. There was ample evidence to support a finding that the officer who signed on behalf of the defendant was authorized to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">The master could find on the evidence that plaintiff\u2019s offer in the form of its written proposal of October 3, 1960, contained in definite terms the promises and performances to be rendered by each party and that upon its acceptance by the defendant a contract between the parties resulted. <em>Maloney </em>v. <em>Company, </em>98 N. H. 78, 82; 1 Williston, Contracts (3d <em>ed.) s. </em>23; Restatement, Contracts, <em>s. </em>32.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">Defendant maintains however that Morrison Booth had full authority to sign on behalf of the plaintiff the \u201cContract\u201d dated October 4, 1960, and that plaintiff accepted it by its president, Alvan Shuman, and is estopped to deny that it constituted a valid and binding agreement between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-9\">The master found and ruled \u201cthat at no time did the plaintiff corporation or any of its officers ever authorize Booth to sign for and on behalf of the corporation. No indication was ever given to the defendant by anyone authorized to do so that Booth had such authority.\u201d The master also found that it was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>necessary that Booth have authority to bind the plaintiff in order to accomplish his job of negotiating. He found that there was no evidence that in operations of the type involved here, this type of authority is usually granted \u201cto persons who function as Booth functioned in the present case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">The master found and ruled that Booth lacked authority either actual, apparent or incidental, to bind the plaintiff and that his signature on the \u201cContract\u201d did not effect a binding agreement between plaintiff and defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">There was evidence that Booth had been \u201cjust working as a commission agent\u201d for the plaintiff for about six months. He would bring leads to the plaintiff\u2019s office, plaintiff\u2019s president, Shuman, would price them, and Booth would go back out and try to sell them and close the deals. There was further evidence that Booth had no authority to execute documents such as the \u201cContract\u201d of October <em>4 </em>and had never executed any contracts of this type previously to the knowledge of plaintiff\u2019s president. A holding that Booth had no actual authority to execute the \u201cContract\u201d on behalf of the plaintiff was warranted on this evidence. <em>Richardson </em>v. Sibley, 101 N. H. 377, 379; Restatement (Second), Agency, <em>s. </em>26. Nor was there any evidence which compelled a finding that incidental authority to execute such a \u201cContract\u201d was essential in order to carry out Booth\u2019s duties as a commission agent. 3 Am. Jur. 2d, Agency, <em>s. </em>71; Restatement (Second), Agency, <em>ss. </em>35, 36, 50, <em>comment </em>b.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">\u201cApparent authority to do an act is created as to a third person by written or spoken words or any other conduct of the principal which, reasonably interpreted, causes the third person to believe that the principal consents to have the act done on his behalf by the person purporting to act for him.\u201d Restatement (Second), Agency, <em>s. </em>27; <em>Record </em>v. <em>Wagner, </em>100 N. H. 419, 421. Officers of the defendant testified that they did not talk to or consult with Shuman prior to the signing of the \u201cContract\u201d and that all the negotiations were made with Booth. There is no dispute that the first proposal from the plaintiff to the defendant was in writing on plaintiff\u2019s letterhead signed, not by Booth, but by Shuman. James Irwin, Jr., an officer of defendant testified as follows: \u201cQ. Did Mr. Booth at any time tell you that you would have to enter into a contract directly with Mr. Shuman? A. Whatever we did sign would involve the H &amp; B Construction firm. I don\u2019t know the legal terms of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>it, but whatever the contract was would be with H &amp; B Construction.\u201d There was no evidence that Booth had ever signed any contract for the plaintiff when he executed the \u201cContract\u201d in this case. The evidence did not compel a finding that any statement, act or conduct of the plaintiff caused the defendant to justifiably believe that plaintiff consented to have Booth execute the \u201cContract\u201d dated October 4, 1960, and bind it thereby thus providing Booth with apparent authority to do so. <em>Davison </em>v. Parks, 79 N. H. 262; <em>Commercial Cas. Co. </em>v. Mansfield, 98 N. H. 120, 132; 3 Am. Jur. 2d, Agency, <em>s. </em>74; Restatement (Second), Agency, ss. 8, 27; <em>Cf. Record </em>v. <em>Wagner, </em>100 N. H. 419.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">The master also found and ruled that when Booth delivered the \u201cContract\u201d to Shuman together with defendant\u2019s check for $2,000, which was also called for in the proposal of October 3, Shuman did not assent to the terms of the \u201cContract\u201d and had no duty to the defendant to reject it. He further found and ruled that Shuman\u2019s doing so would not have changed the situation of the parties who were already bound under the terms of the prior proposal.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">\u201cA person who is not otherwise liable as a party to a transaction purported to be done on his account, is nevertheless subject to liability to persons who have changed their positions because of their belief that the transaction was entered into by or for him, if (a) he intentionally or carelessly caused such belief, or (b) knowing of such belief and that others might change their positions because of it, he did not take reasonable steps to notify them of the facts.\u201d Restatement (Second), Agency, <em>s. </em>8 B; 3 Am. Jur. 2d, Agency, <em>s. </em>76. Shuman testified that when plaintiff received its proposal of October 3, 1960, signed by the defendant it contacted the supplier of materials for the proposed building. When the plaintiff received defendant\u2019s check for $2,000, dated October 4, 1960, it endorsed it to the supplier and sent it as the required deposit for the materials. This same amount was required as a deposit from the defendant under the terms of the proposal of October 3. Shuman also testified that when he saw the \u201cContract\u201d and read the time limit provision he talked to Booth who informed him \u201che would contact the Irwins and get it taken out, and he told me afterwards that he had contacted them and he says \u2018Don\u2019t worry about it. It is all straightened out.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>The materials were not received on the site until December 21, 1960, at which time the erection of the building was started. At that time the defendant made a payment of $15,000 which was in addition to the deposit of $2,000 previously made. Although this was almost a month after the time limit of November 28, 1960, within which the building was to be completed according to clause 9 of the \u201cContract,\u201d plaintiff received no communication from the defendant about delay in performance until it received a letter dated January 11, 1961. This letter however made no reference to the damages provided by clause 9 but enclosed a payment of $5,000, then due. The balance to be paid was not due until the contract was completed. This schedule of payment was called for in the proposal of October 3, 1960, which the master found was the agreement binding the parties and was substantially the same schedule as in the \u201cContract.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">The above conduct of the parties did not compel a holding that plaintiff by its actions induced such a change of position by the defendant as would estop the plaintiff to deny liability under the terms of the \u201cContract\u201d dated October 4, 1960. 2 Williston, Contracts (3d <em>ed.) s. </em>277 B; <em>See Fitch Company </em>v. <em>Insurance Company, </em>99 N. H. 1, 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">The holding of the master, approved by the Trial Court, being sustained, there is no need to discuss the nature and effect of the \u201cTime limits\u201d clause in the \u201cContract.\u201d The defendant, at the trial also waived its claim for damages based upon the cost which it claimed it had incurred to complete the contract. In its brief, defendant states that the contract was substantially completed on February 28, 1961. The only issue remaining to be considered is the award to the plaintiff of $4,278, the balance due under the proposal of October 3, 1960.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">The master\u2019s report stated \u201cthere is no evidence upon which the master could find that the delay in delivery of materials was the fault of the plaintiff. After the delivery of the materials, there was no unreasonable delay not caused by weather or the failure of the defendant to approve changes and the type of plastic to be used.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">The evidence on many of these matters was in conflict and understandably the parties do not agree on the conclusions to be drawn from it. However there was sufficient evidence to support a verdict for the plaintiff in the amount of $4,278, the balance due it under the proposal of October 3, 1960, which could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>be found to have been accepted by the defendant and to constitute the agreement of the parties and not to be breached by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">\n<em>Judgment on the verdict.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b350-6\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
