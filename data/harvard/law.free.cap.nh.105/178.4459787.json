It appears that the defendant himself had requested that this particular attorney, Samuel Green, Esq., a man of long experience and high standing at the Bar, be assigned to him. The Trial Court, in denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a rehearing, at which time this objection was raised, stated that the case \u201cwas well prepared, well tried and that you had . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>a fair trial. ...\u201d A thorough examination of the entire transcript fully supports these conclusions. It appears that the defendant\u2019s counsel conducted the defense energetically and skillfully. The defendant\u2019s claim that his rights were not properly protected by his lawyer finds no support in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">In addition, the Trial Court allowed the accused every latitude throughout the proceedings, permitting him personally to conduct the cross-examination of witnesses whom his attorney had already cross-examined, and ordering the summons of certain persons whom the defendant desired to have present to testify. Nothing improper appears to have occurred at any time which in any manner prejudiced the defendant. The Presiding Justice\u2019s findings that the trial was fair and the defendant competently represented are sustained, and the exceptions thereto are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">The accused\u2019s claim that the evidence was insufficient to support the convictions on the charges of assault with intent to kill his wife Gloria Chance and his mother-in-law Antoinette Fay, on May 21, 1962, demands that the jury accept his version of what happened and reject the testimony of the complainants and the supporting witnesses. The same is true of the charge of simple assault upon Marcel A. Briand on April 30, 1962. No reason appears why the jury were not at liberty to reject the defendant\u2019s story and accept that of the complainants and other witnesses. Without detailing all the circumstances, it is sufficient to say that the record fully sustained the verdicts of guilty on all the above charges of assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">The conviction of the defendant of a simple assault on his wife on March 26, 1962, is also warranted. Here again the jury were not compelled to accept the defendant\u2019s denial of the crime in the face of other testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">With reference to the charge that the defendant willfully damaged Briand\u2019s automobile by breaking the windshield and front window with rocks and slashing the rear tire with a knife, no question is raised. Indeed, the defendant himself admits that he did these things. The verdict of guilty on this complaint is unimpeachable. <em>State </em>v. Farwell, 102 N. H. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-9\">The Court sentenced the defendant to not more than seven or less than three years upon each of the convictions for assault with intent to kill \u2014 the sentences to run concurrently. The order upon all convictions appealed from the Manchester municipal court was \u201ccontinued for sentence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b245-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>The evidence warranted the conclusion that the defendant bound and held both his wife and his mother-in-law, threatening to kill them both with a knife which he thrust at them from time to time. He terrorized them for a substantial period and defied all attempts to rescue his mother-in-law \u2014 his wife having finally escaped \u2014 until he was overpowered by the police. The maximum penalty for each of these offenses under RSA 585:23 is twenty years. In all the circumstances the sentences cannot be said to have been excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">In conclusion, we hold that the defendant had a fair trial, free from error, and the order is</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
