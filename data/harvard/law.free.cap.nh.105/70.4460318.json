The defendant contends that it is a valid defense while the State maintains that the ordinance has no present force or effect and cannot become effective until it is approved by a majority vote of the legal voters present and voting at the next regular election of the town.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-12\">RSA 578:4 prohibiting the sale of merchandise on Sunday with certain exceptions is given some flexibility by RSA 578:5. This latter statute provides that selectmen may adopt ordinances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>permitting and regulating retail business \u201c ... on the Lord\u2019s Day, provided such . . . ordinances are approved by a majority vote of the legal voters present and vojing at the next regular election . . . .\u201d The defendant urges that RSA 578:5 should be construed to hold that the ordinance adopted by the selectmen \u201cbecomes valid and remains valid until such time as the town voters meet at their regular meeting.\u201d The answer to that contention was made at the beginning of the legislative session in January 1961 in <em>Mason </em>v. <em>Salem, </em>103 N. H. 166, 168: \u201cWhen the Legislature has desired that regulations by selectmen shall be immediately effective until approved or rescinded by the voters, they have usually made explicit provision therefor. See RSA 31:41, 42 regulating open-air motion picture theaters.\u201d It is significant that no changes in the Sunday laws to give selectmen interim powers to make regulations and ordinances effective immediately have been made in either the 1961 or the 1963 legislative sessions. See Senate Bill 97 (1963) referred to the Legislative Council. House Journal June 27, 1963, <em>p. </em>44. The ordinance adopted by the selectmen is no defense to the pending criminal complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">The defendant\u2019s exception to the certification of a question of law to this court by the Rollinsford municipal court is overruled. It was decided in <em>State </em>v. <em>Deane, </em>101 N. H. 127, 130 that certification and transfer under RSA 502:24 \u201cis discretionary with the municipal court\u201d and this was specifically reaffirmed in <em>Riendeau </em>v. <em>Milford Municipal Court, </em>104 N. H. 33, 34. The further contention \u201cthat the Rollinsford Municipal Court is not a court of record\u201d is without merit.
