No. 359,547, filed June 4, 1953, for \u201cManufacture of Flat Glass in Continuous Ribbon Form.\u201d Method claims 3, 7 and 11 and apparatus claim 12 stand allowed. The sole issue is patentability over the following references:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b781-19\">De Bay 972,166 Oct. 11, 1910</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b781-20\">Clark 1,424,155 Aug. 1, 1922</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b781-21\">Appellant\u2019s invention relates to the obtaining of a \u201cfire finish\u201d on flat glass produced in continuous ribbon form. As to the nature of a \u201cfire finish,\u201d appellant\u2019s specification states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b781-22\">\u201cIn the manufacture of glass objects such as drinking goblets the surfaces are brilliant because the surfaces set as a result of heat losses achieved solely by radiation, and by heat exchange with a gaseous medium. This result is referred to by glass makers as \u2018fire finish' \u201d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b781-23\">In simple terms, fire finish occurs when melted glass is allowed to cool out of contact with another surface.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-24\">Appellant\u2019s glass sheet is produced in the following manner. Molten glass from a melting tank passes through a spout which directs the glass between a pair of water-cooled casting rolls spaced apart by a distance equal to the desired thickness of the glass ribbon which emerges therefrom. During this operation the glass ribbon rapidly loses heat by conduction to the metal rolls, whereupon the ribbon surfaces in engagement therewith solidify quickly with a dull finish, or at least lacking in the degree of polish desired. The ribbon then passes along a flat supporting surface and beneath a refractory hood in which burners are located which \u201cproduce a sheet of flame which sweeps the whole upper surface of the ribbon [under the hood] * * * in the direction of the moving ribbon * * * the flame from each of the burners * * * moves in substantial parallelism with the ribbon, the flame from each burner being in nature a sheet of flame which progressively sweeps the surface of the moving ribbon as it passes through the heating chamber.\u201d During this operation, the top surface<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>ribbon is remelted. Finally, appellant states in his specification that \u201cafter the ribbon * * * leaves the heating chamber * * * it is exposed to atmosphere and the remelted * * * surface sets solely by loss of heat due to radiation and to heat exchange with a gaseous medium, hence a fire finish is obtained.\u201d It is noted that appellant gets all the polish he wants from the flame and subsequent cooling alone, without any other operation on the glass.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">The claims on appeal are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-6\">\u201c9. Method of manufacturing flat glass in continuous ribbon form characterized by forming the ribbon as it is flowed from a glass melting furnace under conditions to cause a surface of the ribbon to lose substantial heat by conduction, advancing the formed ribbon lengthwise and continuously, <em>forming a sheet of flame and directing it along said surface of the ribbon in substantial parallelism therewith and in the direction of movement of the ribbon to sweep progressively said surface of the advancing ribbon with the sheet of flame, </em>and to impart thereby heat to said surface to an extent at least to compensate <em>for </em>that heat in the surface lost during the forming of the ribbon, and then allowing the remelted surface to set solely due to radiation and to the cooling action of a gaseous medium in contact with said surface while maintaining said surface free from mechanical disturbing influences.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-7\">\u201c10. An apparatus for manufacturing flat glass in continuous ribbon form, comprising means for continuously forming glass in ribbon form from a glass melting furnace including a casting member on which the ribbon is cast, said casting member causing the surface of the ribbon in contact therewith to lose substantial heat by conduction therewith, means for advancing the formed ribbon lengthwise and continuously away from said forming means, <em>means for forming a sheet of flame and for directing it along said surface substantially parallel thereto and in the direction of movement of the ribbon to sweep progressively said surface during the movement of the ribbon </em>and to cause said surface to be remelted, and means <em>for </em>continuously advancing the ribbon with the remelted surface through a setting zone in which the only medium in contact with said surface is a gaseous medium to cause said surface to set solely due to radiation and to the cooling action of said gaseous medium.\u201d [Emphasis ours.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b782-9\">As appellant states, claim 10 is directed to the apparatus for carrying out the method of claim 9. The above italicized passages are the aspect of the invention relied on to patentably distinguish over the references.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-10\">De Bay generally describes his invention and its purpose as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-11\">\u201cThis invention relates to apparatus for making polished plate glass in an expeditious and economical manner and so as to dispense with the grinding or polishing usually employed in making this character of glass.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-12\">\u201cThe essential feature of the apparatus comprises means for forming a plate of glass, together with means for <em>fire finishing or polishing </em>both surfaces of the plate, and means for afterward supporting and conveying the plate to prevent clouding, marring or injuring the glazed or polished surfaces.\u201d [Our emphasis.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b782-13\">The De Bay apparatus and method for producing glass ribbon differ from those disclosed by appellant primarily in three respects. First, three sets of rolls are used to size the ribbon coming from the furnace. The first two sets of rolls are cooled and longitudinally fluted. The third set of rolls is heated and these rolls \u201csmooth out the corrugations or ridges formed in the plastic sheet by the first two pairs of rolls.\u201d Secondly, while De Bay, as does appellant, next passes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>the glass ribbon or \u201cplate\u201d beneath a heating chamber or \u201cfurnace,\u201d De Bay, contrary to appellant, states, \u201cIt is not intended that the flame shall strike the plate.\u201d De Bay also states that the heat of the heating chamber or furnace, which is suspended with its open bottom adjacent the top surface of the ribbon,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-4\">\u201c * * * quickly melts a skin on the top surface of the plate, which when it cools forms the smooth glazed surface known as fire polish. The melting of the surface of the plate is liable to leave the same slightly waved or undulating, or the surface may be irregular from other causes * * *. To take out any waves, undulations or other irregularities, <em>the surface of the plate while still plastic is subjected to a smoothing action by means of a rubbing block 16 </em>which is caused to rub very lightly over the surface, sufficient to smooth out the irregularities and undulations, but without disturbing the molten surface or in any way destroying or marring the glaze.\u201d [Emphasis ours.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">No such smoothing operation is included in appellant\u2019s process or apparatus.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-7\">Clark also is concerned with the production of a glass ribbon which is \u201cpimple\u201d free. The Clark ribbon is drawn vertically from a glass \u201cbath\u201d and then bent through a right angle over a roll to move horizontally. Immediately after passing over this roll, the ribbon passes over a \u201cdistributor\u201d or slotted pipe from which \u201cheated fluid is directed into contact with the under surface of the glass sheet.\u201d This \u201cheated fluid\u201d and its action are thus described by Clark:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-8\">\u201cThe action of such means is substantially a \u2018fire-flashing\u2019 which is sufficient to fuse, or partially fuse, the immediate surface of the sheet to an extent <em>which will obliterate the objectionable pimpling of such surface. </em>This fire-flashing can be accomplished either by air preheated to the necessary temperature and directed against the surface of the glass or by gas or oil fumes directed against such surface. In the drawing I have illustrated a distributor 5 for preheated air or gas.\" [Our emphasis.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b783-10\">The Clark \u201cdistributor\u201d appears to be-coextensive with the width of the glass ribbon, as it obviously would have to be to accomplish its stated purpose. This-\u201cdistributor\u201d is formed \u201ceither with a continuous jet opening * * * or a plurality of staggered jet openings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b783-12\">It is clear to us that Clark discloses contacting a glass ribbon with either a sheet or a series of jets of \u201cheated fluid,\u201d which may be preheated air or \u201cgas or oil fumes.\u201d The Clark drawing, however, discloses that the \u201cdistributor\u201d jet or jets direct the flow of \u201cfluid\u201d against the glass ribbon in a direction to some extent <em>opposite </em>to the direction of movement of the ribbon and at an angle thereto. A cooling jet is also employed by Clark in \u201cback of\u201d the \u201cdistributor,\u201d i. e., away from the \u201cdistributor\u201d in the direction of movement of the glass ribbon, \u201cto solidify the softened surface, when found necessary.\u201d It is pointed in the same somewhat counterflow direction as the distributor.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-13\">The Patent Office rejection of claims 9 and 10 was on De Bay in view of Clark, it being the view of both the examiner and the board \u201cthat it would be obvious to a person of ordinary skill in this art to substitute Clark\u2019s flame for the radiant heating means of De Bay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b783-14\">Appellant objects to this combination of references on several grounds. First, it is stated that De Bay specifically teaches that his flame should not strike the surface of the glass. Accordingly, it is argued, in effect, that the combined teachings of De Bay and Clark would not suggest use of the impinging heated fluid of Clark in the De Bay device because they are mutually inconsistent. Secondly, in appellant\u2019s September 3, 1957, amendment after final rejection, the undesirability of the Clark structure when considered alone was raised when appellant contended, inter alia, that Clark\u2019s stream of heated fluid \u201cimpinging on the surface of the ribbon at high <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>velocity and almost at right angles thereto, creates an impact resulting in the ploughing of the remelted surface of the glass.\u201d This is not supported by any proofs and is mere speculation so far as the record before us is concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-4\">Appellant argues that Clark does not disclose \u201cflames\u201d contacting the surface of the glass ribbon. Clark, however, clearly discloses a wide choice of media which may be used to \u201cfire flash\u201d a surface of the glass ribbon, including \u201cpreheated\u201d \u201cair\u201d and \u201cgas or oil fumes\u201d as all being suitable for his \u201cfire flashing\u201d operation. It is our opinion that one skilled in the art would consider it obvious to cause the emanation of \u201cflames\u201d from the Clark \u201cdistributor\u201d if such is not, indeed, expressly disclosed in Clark\u2019s reference to gas and oil \u201cfumes\u201d as an alternative to preheated air. It surely would be obvious to use fire for fire flashing, though the term may not so require.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">The main point for our consideration, however, is the obviousness of appellant\u2019s claimed feature of <em>directing his flames along the surface of his ribbon in substantial parallelism thereto and in the direction of movement thereof. </em>Neither De Bay nor Clark shows this feature.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">Appellant alleges that the location and direction of his sheet of flame are important and unobvious for several reasons. In his September 3, 1957 amendment, previously noted, appellant listed four advantageous effects attributable to his particular flame direction. They are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AdPB\">\u201c(1) It sweeps over the surface to be remelted, so that the heat has little penetrative action and is localized mainly on the surface where it is required, while the integrity and physical form of the body of the glass is maintained with little or no disturbance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-7\">\u201c(2) It creates a heating zone of substantial length along the ribbon according to the length of the flame, thereby permitting the ribbon to move at a much faster rate than is permitted by Clark with his restricted heating zone.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-9\">\u201c(3) It moves over the surface of the ribbon gently and with minimum of impact, and whatever impact there is, is transmitted in a sweeping direction tending to smooth out the surface rather than plough it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-10\">\u201c(4) It directs the heat away from the casting or sizing members or rolls where the ribbon is formed. The remelting zone must be located as close to these rolls as possible in order to conserve heat.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b784-11\">The position of the Patent Office Solicitor is that there is an ample basis for finding the claimed invention to be obvious in view of De Bay and Clark. With this we cannot agree. While we disagree with the view of appellant that Clark does not teach the use of a flame impinging on the glass to fire finish it, the flame which would be present in Clark\u2019s apparatus would impinge on the glass at an angle, rather than parallel to its surface, and in a direction opposite to the direction of movement, rather than in the same direction. Therefore, if this, the only relevant disclosure of Clark, were to be substituted for De Bay\u2019s radiant heating furnace, the claimed invention would not be produced. Furthermore, when De Bay\u2019s teaching is taken at face value it amounts to an instruction that flame impinging on the glass surface should not be used at all. We are therefore of the opinion that there is no suggestion in the references for such a combination of features. All these references amount to is two disclosures of different fire polishing methods which are contradictory and neither of which suggests doing it in the manner or with the apparatus disclosed and claimed by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-12\">For the above reasons, the decision of the board is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-13\">Reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b784-14\">MARTIN, Judge, sat but did not participate because of illness.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b781-17\">. Appellant\u2019s disclosure includes apparatus for placing a \u201cfire finish\u201d on both the top and bottom surfaces of the glass ribbon. This structure is not before us on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
