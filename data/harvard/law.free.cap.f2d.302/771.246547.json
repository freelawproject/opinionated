The motion is also accompanied by papers purporting to overcome the \u201cD\u00e9livr\u00e9\u201d date of Mulard under the provisions of Rule 131 of the Rules of Practice of the Patent Office, 35 U.S.C.A.Appendix.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-24\">Noting that appellants are seeking, after final decision on appeal to this court, to raise an issue not raised at an appropriate time, we find no basis for remanding the case. The motion is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-25\">Appellants have also moved to extend the time for bringing a petition for rehearing under Rule 7 of this court, 35 U.S.C.A.Appendix. This motion is granted to the extent that the time is extended to expire twenty days from the date of this order.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
