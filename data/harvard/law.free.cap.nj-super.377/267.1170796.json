The setoff provision provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-7\">[a]ny person having a claim against an insurer, whether or not the insurer is a member insurer, under any provision in an insurance policy other than a policy of an insolvent insurer which is also a covered claim, shall be required to exhaust first his right under that other policy. An amount payable on a covered claim ... shall be reduced by the amount of recovery under any such insurance policy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-8\"><em>[NJ.S.A. </em>17:30A-12bJ</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b301-9\">We hold that the Association is entitled to a setoff of the full amount paid by a solvent insurer. In other words, when there is coverage by two policies and the exhaustion of the solvent insurer\u2019s policy does not completely recompense the claimant\u2019s damages, the Association is still entitled to the setoff. Thus, the Association\u2019s obligation is extinguished if the setoff equals or exceeds the $300,000 statutory cap for covered claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b301-11\">The facts are undisputed. On September 5, 1996, Larry Spell, then thirty-eight years old, was a passenger in a 1994 Dodge para-transit van owned by Caring, Inc. and leased to Caring Medical Day Services, Inc. (collectively \u201cCaring\u201d) and operated by Janice Mercer-Charles, an employee of Caring. There was a collision between the van and a vehicle operated by Christine Thomsen. As a result of the impact, the van crashed into a telephone pole. Spell suffered a fractured neck and was rendered a quadriplegic. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>Alice F. Watts, another passenger in the van, died as a result of the accident. Lawsuits were filed by Spell, the Estate \u00f3f Watts, Thomsen and Mercer-Charles against various parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">At the time of the accident, Caring was insured pursuant to a business automobile policy issued by Philadelphia Insurance Company (PIC). The PIC policy provided liability coverage in the amount of $1 million for any one accident. Caring was also insured pursuant to a commercial insurance policy issued by Reliance Insurance Company (Reliance). The Reliance policy provided liability coverage in the amount of $1 million for any one accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">Spell offered to settle his claims against Mercer-Charles and Caring for $2 million. The offer was eventually accepted by Caring\u2019s insurers, PIC and Reliance. A consent order was entered permitting PIC and Reliance to deposit their respective policy limits into court, pending an allocation hearing. PIC deposited its $1 million. However, before Reliance deposited its limit, it was declared insolvent and ordered into liquidation by a Pennsylvania court. As a result, the Association moved successfully to intervene in the litigation and assumed responsibility for claims against Reliance\u2019s insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">The Association moved for a declaration that its $300,000 per claim statutory obligation must be reduced by any amount received from PIC, the solvent insurer. Spell opposed this motion. For purposes of the motion, the parties agreed that Spell\u2019s damages exceeded $2 million. In a written opinion, the judge denied the Association\u2019s motion, ruling that it is not entitled to any setoff. The judge interpreted the language of the setoff provision to mean that the setoff only applies to insurance proceeds payable as a direct result of insolvency.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b302-9\">The Association appeals contending that pursuant to the setoff provision, its obligation to pay statutory benefits to Spell is reduced to zero. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>We begin our analysis by restating certain core principles of the Act\u2019s legislative scheme. First, the Association is not an insurer. It is a private, non-profit, unincorporated legal entity. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:30A-6; <em>Am. Employers\u2019 Ins. Co. v. Elf Atochem N. Am., Inc., </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>580, 586-87, 725 A.2d 1093, 1096-97 (1999). It depends upon revenue received through statutory assessments levied upon its members, who are insurers writing defined types of direct insurance. <em>Johnson v. Braddy, </em>376 <em>N.J.Super. </em>215, 218, 869 A.2d 964 (App.Div.2005); <em>Harrow Stores, Inc. v. Hanover Ins. Co., </em>315 <em>N.J.Super. </em>547, 719 A.2d 196 (App.Div.1998). Those assessments are ultimately recouped through policy surcharges imposed upon policyholders, who hold policies embraced within the scope of the Act. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:30A-8a(3); <em>N.J.A.C. </em>11:1-6.3. The statutory mandate requires the Association to administer and pay \u201ccovered claims\u201d that are asserted against insolvent insurers and their policyholders. The Association\u2019s purpose is \u201cto provide a mechanism for the payment of covered claims under certain insurance policies, to avoid excessive delay in payment, [and] to avoid financial loss to claimants or policyholders because of the insolvency of an insurer ...\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:30A-2a. The Act is to be construed liberally to effect its purposes. <em>Carpenter Tech. Corp. v. Admiral Ins. Co., </em>172 <em>N.J. </em>504, 516-17, 800 A.2d 54, 61-62 (2002) (citing <em>Am. Employers\u2019 Ins. Co., supra, </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>at 590, 725 A.2d at 1098-99 and <em>N.J. Guar. Ass\u2019n. on Behalf of the Midland Ins. Co. v. Ciani, </em>242 <em>N.J.Super. </em>164, 169, 576 A.2d 300, 303 (App.Div.1990)). The Legislature sought \u201cto conserve limited Association resources to better assure their availability to serve core purposes.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">Second, the Legislature created the Association to provide <em>\u201ca measure </em>of relief for policyholders and claimants in the case of insurer insolvency.\u201d <em>Ciani, supra, </em>242 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 169, 576 A.2d at 303 (emphasis added). It did not intend to \u201csubstitute the Association for the defunct insurer so as to prevent <em>all loss </em>to affected parties.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(emphasis added); <em>see also Carpenter Tech. Corp., supra, </em>172 <em>N.J. </em>at 515, 800 A.2d at 60-61; <em>Am. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number><em>Employers\u2019 Ins. Co., supra, </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>at 590, 725 A.2d at 1098-99. In short, the Association is a limited safety net. It was not designed to put a claimant in the same position as if there had been no insolvency.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">Third, the Association does not pay an injured party\u2019s entire loss. Instead, it pays only those losses qualifying as \u201ccovered claims\u201d pursuant to the terms of the Act. <em>See Carpenter Tech. Corp., supra, </em>172 <em>N.J. </em>at 508-09, 800 A.2d at 56-57. A \u201ccovered claim\u201d is defined as an unpaid claim within the purview of a policy issued by an insurer, which became insolvent after January 1, 1974 and: (1) the claimant or insured is a resident of New Jersey at the time of the insured event; or (2) the property from which the claim arises is permanently located in New Jersey. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:30A-5d. Moreover, \u2018\u201ccovered claim\u2019 shall not include any amount due any ... insurer ... as subrogation recoveries or otherwise.\u201d Ibid.; <em>Carpenter Tech. Corp., supra, </em>172 <em>N.J. </em>at 516, 800 A.2d at 61; <em>Primus v. Alfred Sanzari Enter., </em>372 <em>N.J.Super. </em>392, 402, 859 A.2d 452, 458 (App.Div.2004). There is a $300,000 statutory ceiling or cap on a covered claim set by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:30A-8a(l). This ceiling applies regardless of whether or not a claimant\u2019s policy exceeds that amount. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">Fourth, where a claim is covered by numerous policies, some issued by solvent insurers and some by insolvent insurers, the Act expressly sets a priority for coverage. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:30A-12b sets the priority of claims between the Association and solvent insurers.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Jendrzejewski v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>341 <em>N.J.Super. </em>460, 463, 775 A.2d 583, 584 (App.Div.2001). The purpose of the setoff provision \u201cwas to conserve the assets of the [Association\u2019s fund] by shielding it from liability for the obligations of insolvent insurers where there is other insurance covering the same claim that is covered by the insolvent insurer\u2019s policy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 464, 775 A.2d at 585. A claimant must first exhaust the solvent insurer\u2019s policy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>limits. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:30A-12b. The covered claim is thus reduced by the amount recovered from a solvent insurer. <em>Ibid. </em>This statutory priority and setoff trumps traditional principles of priority of coverage, such as primary, excess and co-equal. This is so because the Legislature has created a remedy, albeit a limited one, in a situation where claimants previously had little recourse against an insolvent insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">Summarizing, based on the language and the intent of the Act, it is clear that the Association was designed to spread the loss incurred by a claimant due to insolvency. It insures that such a claimant receives damages from some source, including the Association, up to a cap or ceiling of $300,000. If the claimant receives from a solvent insurer an amount equal to or greater than $300,000, the Association\u2019s obligation to provide statutory benefits is exhausted. Thus, the Association\u2019s funds are preserved in order to provide a measure of relief to other potential claimants.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">Applying those principles here, we conclude that Spell must first exhaust the coverage afforded by the PIC policy. He may then seek recovery from the Association, subject to the $300,000 cap and a setoff in the amount recovered from PIC. <em>See Harrow Stores, Inc., supra, </em>315 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 554-55, 719 A.2d at 200-01; <em>Sayre v. Ins. Co. of N. Am., </em>305 <em>N.J.Super. </em>209, 215, 701 A.2d 1311, 1314 (App.Div.1997). Thus, here the Association\u2019s obligation to Spell is exhausted or reduced to zero by virtue of the setoff provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-9\">We reject the argument advanced by Spell and accepted by the judge that the setoff provision applies only to insurance proceeds payable as a direct result of the insolvency of a insurer. Other than uninsured motorist coverage, we cannot identify any type of coverage payable directly as a result of the insolvency of a insurer. Moreover, the setoff provision applies in situations where there is \u201coverlapping coverage of a solvent and insolvent insurer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>during the same period of time.\u201d <em>Sayre, supra, </em>805 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 214, 701 A.2d at 1314.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">We also reject the argument that the setoff should be reduced from the total amount of the claimant\u2019s losses, not from the $300,000 \u201ccovered claim\u201d ceiling. The express and unambiguous language of the Act mandates that the setoff be deducted from a \u201ccovered claim.\u201d By definition, a \u201ccovered claim\u201d is the amount that the Association is potentially obligated to pay, not the full extent of the damages suffered by the claimant. <em>See Carpenter Tech. Corp., supra, </em>172 <em>N.J. </em>at 526, 800 A.2d at 67 (holding that a setoff for amounts recoverable from a foreign state\u2019s insurance guaranty association should be deducted from any amount recoverable from the Association).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">The Law Division judge relied on several cases from other states to support his decision. However, these eases are distinguishable. In Ariz. <em>Prop. &amp; Cas. Ins. Guar. Fund v. Herder, </em>156 <em>Ariz. </em>203, 751 P.2d 519 (1988), a passenger was injured when the automobile in which he was traveling was hit by an uninsured motorist. The parties stipulated that the passenger\u2019s damages exceeded $30,000. <em>Id. </em>at 520. The passenger was covered by two uninsured motorists (UM) policies, his own and that of his host driver. <em>Ibid. </em>Both policies had $15,000 per person limits. <em>Ibid. </em>The passenger recovered UM benefits in the amount of $15,000 from the host driver\u2019s insurance. <em>Ibid. </em>However, his own insurer had become insolvent. <em>Ibid. </em>The passenger sought recovery from APCIGF, Arizona\u2019s equivalent of the Association.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> APCIGF refused payment, arguing that pursuant to <em>A.R.S. </em>\u00a7 20-673C (2005), it was required to pay the $15,000 limits of the policy issued by the insolvent insurer, and this was reduced by the amount recovered from the host driver\u2019s insurer. <em>Id. </em>at 521. The Supreme Court of Arizona held that the passenger could recover the additional $15,000 from APCIGF. <em>Id. </em>at 524.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number><em>Herder </em>dealt with a different situation than the one presented here. The Arizona statute deems a policy issued by an insolvent insurer to be \u201cexcess coverage.\u201d <em>A.R.S. </em>\u00a7 20-673C (2005). New Jersey does not employ such a provision. Thus, in New Jersey, an insolvent insurer\u2019s policy is not deemed excess coverage. Rather, the Association\u2019s benefits are to be reached only after all solvent insurers\u2019 policies are exhausted. This is significantly different than creating a level of excess coverage where none had existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">The judge also relied on <em>Wash. Ins. Guar. Ass\u2019n v. McKinstry Co., </em>56 <em>Wash.App. </em>545, 784 P.2d 190 (1990). The case is factually distinguishable. There, an insured was sued on a negligence claim exceeding $1 million. <em>Id. </em>at 191. The insured\u2019s primary insurance carrier tendered its policy limit of $500,000. <em>Ibid. </em>However, the excess carrier became insolvent. <em>Ibid. </em>WIGA, Washington\u2019s equivalent of the Association,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> refused to pay the remaining $500,000, arguing that the amount payable should be reduced by the amount of any recovery under the primary insurer\u2019s policy. <em>Ibid. </em>The Court of Appeals of Washington held that WIGA could not offset payments by a primary insurer when it is standing in the shoes of an insolvent excess insurer. <em>Id. </em>at 194. Therefore, <em>McKinstry Co. </em>is distinguishable because it dealt with different types of insurers: primary and excess.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">Finally, the judge relied on <em>CD Inv. Co. et al. v. Cal. Ins. Guar. Ass\u2019n, </em>84 <em>Cal.App.4th. </em>1410, 101 <em>Cal.Rptr.2d </em>806 (2000). That holding is distinguishable because it concerned policies issued to cover five successive periods. <em>Id. </em>at 1417, 101 Cal.Rptr.2d 806. There, the insureds became insolvent. <em>Ibid. </em>Their obligations were assumed by CIGA, California\u2019s equivalent to the Association. <em>Ibid. </em>CIGA denied the claims, arguing that the solvent insurers had already paid $1.5 million, which exceeded CIGA\u2019s statutory cap of $500,000. <em>Ibid. </em>The California Court of Appeals held: (1) the statutory cap applies separately to each covered claim; and (2) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>each policy issued for a specific period of time gives rise to a separate covered claim. <em>Id. </em>at 1429, 101 <em>Cal.Rptr.2d </em>806. Thus, the <em>CD </em>case is distinguishable because we are not dealing with coverage for separate or successive periods, but with two policies covering the same loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">Accordingly, the order denying the Association\u2019s motion is reversed. The matter is remanded to the Law Division, Atlantic County, for the entry of a judgment declaring that the Association\u2019s obligation to pay Spell\u2019s covered claim has been eliminated by PIC\u2019s payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b301-12\"> <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:30A-1 to-20.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b304-6\"> <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:30A-12a sets priorities for claims against the Association and similar entities in other states.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b306-7\"> APCIGF\u2019s statutoiy cap is $100,000. <em>A.R.S. </em>\u00a7 20-667B (2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b307-8\"> WIGA's statutory cap is $300,000. <em>RCWA </em>48.32.0601(a) (2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b308-7\">WEISSBARD, J.A.D.,</author>\n<p id=\"AKa\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-8\">I conclude that where, as here, a person is grievously injured in an accident for which there is liability coverage under two insurance policies, one with a carrier that becomes insolvent, the individual is not precluded by <em>N.J.S.A, </em>17:30A-12b from recovering the maximum amount available from the New Jersey Property-Liability Guaranty Association (PLIGA) by virtue of having recovered a greater amount from the solvent carrier, where the individual\u2019s damages are not satisfied by the amount received from the solvent carrier. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent for the reasons expressed by Judge Perskie in his careful, exhaustive and, in my view, persuasive written opinion which states, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-9\">The dispute in this matter turns on the meaning to be ascribed to the phrase \u201can amount payable on a covered claim ... shall be reduced by the amount of recovery\u201d in Section 12(b). As Plaintiffs interpret this language, and in particular the reference to \u201ccovered claim,\u201d it means that NJPLIGA is entitled to a credit against its obligation only for those insurance proceeds available to Plaintiffs arising out of and attributable to the insolvency of Reliance. Because the PIC proceeds are available irrespective of Reliance\u2019s insolvency and payment from NJPLIGA would therefore not be a \u201cdouble recovery\u201d or a \u201cwindfall,\u201d Plaintiffs insist that the offset provision of Section 12(b) has no application to their claim. NJPLIGA, on the other hand, argues that Section 12(b) was designed to protect the Fund by limiting its liability whenever a claimant has recourse to other insurance that applies to the claim, whether or not that other coverage \u201carises out of\u2019 the insolvency of an insurer, and that no payment from the Fund is required if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>Plaintiffs have available coverage in excess of NJPLIGA\u2019s statutory limit of $300,000.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-6\">There is no reported opinion in New Jersey that directly addresses the issue here presented. There are, however, two New Jersey decisions that discuss the provisions of Section 12 and a number of decisions in other jurisdictions, dealing with substantively identical statutory language, that provide assistance in interpreting the Act and applying it to the facts of this ease.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-7\">In <em>Harrow Stores, Inc. v. Hanover Ins. Co., </em>315 <em>N.J.Super. </em>547[, 719 A.2d 1961 (App.Div.1998), the court dealt with the issue of \u201cPrimary\u201d and \u201csecondary\u201d coverages in the context of NJPLIGA\u2019s obligations under the Act. In <em>Harrow, </em>the claimant sued both the manufacturer and the distributor of a chair on which she was injured. The products liability insurer for the manufacturer was insolvent and the distributor\u2019s solvent insurer provided coverage for the plaintiffs claim. NJPLIGA was standing in the place of the insolvent carrier. Reversing a trial court ruling that had determined that NJPLIGA\u2019s obligations and those of the solvent insurer were \u201cboth primary,\u201d the Appellate Division observed that \u201cthe evident purpose of that provision [Section 12(b)] was to conserve the assets of the Property Liability Insurance Guaranty Fund by shielding it from liability for the obligations of insolvent insurers where there is other insurance covering the same claim that is covered by the insolvent insurer\u2019s policy.\u201d <em>Harrow, supra, 315 N.J.Super. </em>at <em>554[, </em>719 A.2d at 199]. The court held that \u201cwhere the same covered claim is covered both by a solvent insurer\u2019s policy and an insolvent insurer\u2019s policy, the insolvent insurer\u2019s policy, irrespective of any \u2018other insurance\u2019 clause in the policy, cannot be resorted to by the claimant until the policy limits under the solvent insurer\u2019s policy are exhausted.

The issue before the Supreme Court was the amount of the credit to which NJPLIGA was entitled, under Section 12(a), by reason of the payments from the Pennsylvania Fund. The trial court had concluded that NJPLIGA was entitled to a credit for each covered claim of $299,900. The Appellate Division had rejected that conclusion, holding that NJPLIGA was entitled only to a credit for the amount that the Pennsylvania fund actually paid to the claimant in settlement of each covered claim.

In <em>Sands v. Pennsylvania Ins. Guar. Ass\u2019n., </em>283 <em>Pa.Super. </em>217, 423 A.2d 1224 (1980), a passenger was injured in a two-car accident. The passenger\u2019s driver was insured and the other driver was not. The passenger recovered his medical expenses and then settled an uninsured motorist claim with the driver\u2019s carrier for $10,000. He then claimed against his own carrier, under uninsured motorist coverage, for an additional $10,000. The total claim exceeded $26,000. The passenger\u2019s insurer was insolvent and the Pennsylvania equivalent of NJPLIGA refused payment. The court held that the passenger was required to credit the Pennsylvania Fund not with the sum that he could have received from the driver\u2019s carrier, but rather only the amount that he actually did receive. The court reasoned that any additional sums theoretically recoverable against the driver were dependent upon a showing of the driver\u2019s fault, and that had never been established. This conclusion is inconsistent with the rationale, although not of course the actual holding of our Supreme Court in <em>Carpenter, supra, </em>which limited NJPLIGA\u2019s liability by crediting it with the maximum amount recoverable from the Pennsylvania Fund rather than the amounts received by the claimants through a negotiated settlement. Of more immediate relevance to the issue at bar, however, is the fact that the <em>Sands </em>court also rejected the Fund\u2019s argument that the passenger\u2019s recovery from other sources of more than the Fund\u2019s maximum exposure of $9,900 for each covered claim eliminated any liability of the Fund. The court reasoned that the amount recovered by the passenger under the driver\u2019s uninsured motorist coverage did not constitute a \u201ccovered claim\u201d because it did not result from the insolvency of an insurer, and therefore did not create the possibility of the duplication of recovery that 40 <em>P.S. </em>\u00a7 1701.503(a) (\u201cSec. 503(a)\u201d), Pennsylvania\u2019s equivalent of Section 12(b), was designed to prevent. <em>Sands, supra, </em>283 <em>Pa.Super. </em>at 225, 423 A.2d at 1227-8.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-7\">In <em>Bullock v.

The business had liability insurance of $10,000 for each claim but the insurer was insolvent. The court rejected the Fund\u2019s position that the disability benefits that the claimant had received from her own insurer should be credited against the Fund\u2019s obligation under Section 503(a), applying the same theory that the <em>Sands </em>court had used in defining a \u201ccovered claim.\u201d <em>Bullock supra, </em>311 <em>Pa.Super. </em>at 494, 457 A.2d at 1290.

Pennsylvania Ins. Guar. Ass\u2019n., </em>390 <em>Pa.Super. </em>31, 567 A.2d 1103 (1989) involved a passenger injured in a two-vehicle accident. The other driver\u2019s insurance carrier was insolvent and thus, under Pennsylvania law, the other driver was deemed \u201cuninsured\u201d by reason of the insolvency. <em>Id. </em>at 33, 567 A.2d at 1104. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>The claimant recovered $40,000 from her driver\u2019s uninsured motorist coverage and $25,000 from her own uninsured motorist coverage.

The court held that Section 503(a) required the claimant to credit the Fund with the $65,000 that she had received, limiting the Fund\u2019s exposure on her claim to $234,900 because the $65,000 had been \u201creceived by the claimant due to the insolvency of an insurer.\u201d <em>Id, </em>at 35, 567 A.2d at 1105. Significantly, the court stated:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-5\">We recognize that the <em>Sands </em>decision clearly stands for the proposition that a claimant will never be placed in a <em>better </em>position by virtue of the existence of PIGA, than he would have been in had the insurance company not become insolvent. However, it is equally clear that the Legislature did not intend, in enacting the Insurance Guaranty Act, that in all cases a claimant would be placed in the <em>same </em>position he would have been in had the insurance company remained solvent. Even with the existence of PIGA, it was anticipated by the Legislature that some claimants would suffer some amount of financial loss due to the insolvency of an insurer, because PIGA\u2019s obligation to a claimant is limited to $300,000 less the $100 deductible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-6\"><em>Blackwell, supra, </em>390 <em>Pa.Super. </em>at 37, 567 A.2d at 1106 (emphasis in original) From these Pennsylvania decisions, Plaintiffs extract the principle that Section 12(b) requires a credit against NJPLIGA\u2019s obligation only for those sums recoverable by Plaintiffs as a result of the insolvency of an insurer. Because the amounts recoverable by Plaintiffs from PIC would be payable irrespective of Reliance\u2019s insolvency status, and because the total value of the claims exceeds the combined liability of PIC and NJPLIGA, Plaintiffs argue that there is no possibility of a \u201cdouble recovery\u2019 or a \u201cwindfall\u201d and that, subject to the exhaustion of the other available insurance proceeds, NJPLIGA should not be entitled to any credit, under Section 12(b), against any remaining balance of the claims for the amounts that Plaintiffs will receive from PIC.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-7\">Several cases from other jurisdictions support Plaintiffs\u2019 argument. In <em>Arizona Prop. &amp; Cas. Ins. Guar. Fund v. Herder, </em>156 <em>Ariz. </em>203, 751 P.2d 519 (1988), a decision cited by our Supreme Court in <em>Carpenter, supra, </em>172 <em>N.J. </em>at [514, 800 A.2d at 60], as illustrative of the \u201cambiguity of Section 12(b), the claimant was a passenger who was injured in a collision with an uninsured driver. His damages exceeded $30,000. The claimant recovered $15,000 from his driver\u2019s uninsured motorist coverage but his own insurer became insolvent. When the claimant sought recovery from Arizona\u2019s equivalent of NJPLIGA for the $15,000 that he would have received from his own insurer, the Arizona Fund refused payment pursuant to the Arizona equivalent of Section 12(b). The Arizona Supreme Court ruled that the statute was \u201cintended to reduce an insurer\u2019s liability and prevent double recovery by an insured when there is another policy covering the same loss.\u201d <em>Herder, supra, </em>156 <em>Ariz. </em>at 205, 751 P.2d at 521. Following the same rationale as was employed by our Appellate Division in <em>Harrow Stores, Inc. v. Hanover Ins. Co., </em>315 <em>N.J.Super. </em>547, 719 A.2d 196 (App.Div.1998), the Arizona court utilized an \u201cother insurance\u201d analysis and ruled that the Fund\u2019s liability would be secondary rather than primary. <em>Id, </em>at 207, 751 P.2d at 523. The court determined, however, that the Fund would be liable for that portion of the claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>that exceeded the coverage available from the claimant\u2019s own insurer, ruling that the statutory reference to \u201cany amount payable on a covered claim shall be reduced\u201d referred only to a reduction in the amount of the damage claim, not to a reduction in the amount payable by the Fund. \u201cThis construction furthers the statutory purpose of preventing duplication in damage payments to the claimant and preventing the claimant from attempting to invoke the collateral source rule.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 207-8, 751 P.2d at 523-4.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-6\">The Washington Court of Appeals reached a similar conclusion in <em>Washington Ins. Guar. Ass\u2019n. v. McKinstry Co., </em>56 <em>Wash.App. </em>545, 784 P.2d 190 (1990). In that case, the insured was sued for negligence in a claim with a value in excess of $1 million. The insured\u2019s primary carrier paid the claimant its full policy, in the amount of $500,000. The insured\u2019s excess carrier was insolvent. Washington\u2019s equivalent of NJPLIGA refused to pay on a claim against it, arguing that the recovery of the $500,000 by the claimant exceeded the $299,900 statutory limit on the Washington Fund\u2019s liability. Again, the statutory language was equivalent to Section 12(b). The claimant argued that the statute was designed only to prevent duplicative recovery. The Fund argued, as does NJPLIGA here, that the statute was designed to bar a recovery from the Fund whenever another source of recovery is available which is at least equal to the Fund\u2019s limit of obligation. The court ruled that the Fund was liable up to its statutory limit, without any credit for the sums received by the claimant pursuant to the primary coverage. \u201cThus, the statute provides for a reduction of [the fund\u2019s] statutory obligation only where a claimant, has another source of recovery for the claim <em>against the insolvent insurer, </em>not where a claimant has <em>any </em>other source of recovery.\u201d <em>Id </em>at 550, 784 P.2d at 192 (emphasis in original). This rationale, of course, parallels that of Plaintiffs\u2019 construction of the results of the Pennsylvania cases above referenced.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-7\">In CD <em>Investment Co., et al. v. California Ins. Guar. Assn., </em>84 Cal.App.4th 1410, 101 <em>Cal.Rptr.2d </em>806 (2000), the claimant settled litigation against it by agreeing to pay a total of $2,375,000, together with attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. Each of three solvent insurers that had provided coverage to the claimant paid $500,000 toward the settlement. Two additional insurers became insolvent and their obligations were assumed by CIGA California\u2019s version of NJPLIGA, whose liability, under California\u2019s version of the Act, was limited to $500,000 for each covered claim. CIGA declined payment, arguing, as does NJPLIGA here, that the claimant\u2019s receipt, from the solvent insurers, of more than the limit of CIGA\u2019s liability released it from any exposure. The Court of Appeal reversed a lower court ruling in favor of CIGA, stating:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-8\">In our view, the \u201cother insurance\u201d provision simply ensures that CIGA is the insurer of last resort. If other insurance of a \u201ccovered class\u201d is available on a covered claim, CIGA is responsible only for the amount, if any, exceeding that coverage, up to a maximum of $500,000 (citation omitted). But, as the plain language of the statute indicates, the \u201cother insurance\u201d limitation applies separately to each covered claim. Here, CD Investment has a separate covered claim under each of the insolvent insurers\u2019 policies, none of which were covered by any other insurance. Given the lack of other insurance, CIGA\u2019s $500,000 cap has not been met on any of those claims. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>Second, CIGA\u2019s contention is flawed because it improperly uses the payments by the solvent insurers to offset (and in this case, eliminate) CIGA\u2019s own obligation to make payments on behalf of the insolvent insurers. On this issue, we do not write on a clean slate. The courts of other states, in applying their own insurance guarantee laws, have soundly rejected CIGA\u2019s interpretation.

Wilson, </em>(2003 WL 367831, decided February 20, 2003). In this case the claimant was injured in an automobile accident involving a driver insured by Reliance. The damages were stipulated as being in excess of any available insurance coverage. The claimant recovered $100,000 from other insurance coverage. Delaware\u2019s statutory structure parallels Section 12(b) and its equivalent of NJPLIGA also has a $300,000 cap on its liability. The Delaware Fund argued that, by reason of the claimant\u2019s recovery in excess of the Fund\u2019s statutory cap, it was entitled to a credit against its liability to the claimant and should therefore be required to pay only $200,000 on the claim. The claimant\u2019s position, similar to Plaintiffs\u2019 here, was that the statutory reference to the \u201creduction\u201d in the \u201camount payable\u201d referred to a reduction in the amount of the claim that could be asserted against the Fund, not to a reduction in the amount payable by the Fund. The court, however, agreed with the Fund and ruled that the Pennsylvania Superior Court decision in <em>Blackwell v. Pennsylvania Ins. Guar. Ass\u2019n., </em>390 <em>Pa.Super. </em>31, 567 A.2d 1103 (1989), was both apposite and persuasive. The Delaware court did not focus on or discuss the \u201ccovered claim\u201d issue that Plaintiffs here insist is a distinguishing aspect of the <em>Blackwell </em>decision, and the opinion does not reference or discuss the eases throughout the country that reached the opposite conclusion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>From all of the foregoing, it is apparent that the determination of the issue <em>sub judice </em>implicates significant policy considerations as well as questions of statutory interpretation. The specific language of Section 12(b) has, as noted; been adopted in states throughout the nation, and there is apparently no conclusion in the several courts\u2019 review of the language more consistent than the observation of the Arizona Supreme Court in <em>Herder, supra, </em>156 <em>Ariz. </em>at 207, 751 P.2d at 523, cited by the Nevada Supreme Court in <em>Cimini v. Nevada Ins. Guar.

I find these cases persuasive, and the results fully consonant with the approach taken by our courts in <em>Carpenter </em>and <em>Harrow. Carpenter </em>established the standard that the statute should be applied so as to \u201cresult in [an] as equitable as possible allocation of the inevitable loss where \u2018everyone makes some concessions to the common necessity and no one suffers too much.\u2019 \u201d <em>Carpenter, supra, </em>172 <em>N.J. </em>at 5151, 800 A.2d at 60], On these facts, interpreting Section 12(b) as Plaintiffs urge will result in no \u201cwindfall\u201d or double recovery for Plaintiffs, and NJPLIGA\u2019s exposure will be, as required by the Act, limited to the replacement of up to $300,000 for each of the covered claims. This result is consistent with those in both <em>Carpenter </em>and <em>Harrow, </em>where the principles were established that NJPLIGA\u2019s exposure is secondary to that of the solvent carriers and to the obligations of a comparable Fund in the state of the residence of the claimant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-7\">Nor is this result precluded by the words of Section 12(b). Acknowledging, as, has been amply observed, the deficiencies in the legislative draftsmanship, the \u201cspirit of the law\u201d behind the words is, in my view, most effectively realized by an interpretation that links the required reduction in NJPLIGA\u2019s exposure to the availability of other insurance that \u201carises out of and is within the coverage\u201d issued by the insolvent insurer. Were it otherwise, a claimant would be artificially disadvantaged by the fortuitous fact that he or she had other available insurance that would, but for the insolvency, be additive to, rather than a replacement of, the coverage provided by the insolvent carrier. There is nothing in the language or legislative history of Section 12(b) that compels this result, and the focus of <em>Carpenter </em>on the \u201cspirit\u201d of a law that was designed to further an allocation of risk that is \u201cas equitable as possible\u201d militates in favor of the position taken by Plaintiffs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-8\">The <em>Blackwell </em>decision upon which the court relied in <em>Marra </em>is, on its facts, not to the contrary. <em>Blackwell v.

Of course, in view of the statute\u2019s limit on the liability of the Fund, some claimants with very serious injuries and insufficient other insurance, such as Spell, will not be in the \u201csame\u201d position as if there had been no insolvency, but that policy determination by the Legislature, articulated in <em>N.J.S.</em>A 17:30A-2(a), reflects a balanced approach to the stated legislative purpose: to \u201cprovide a mechanism for the payment of covered claims under certain insurance policies, to avoid excessive delay payment, to avoid financial loss to claimants or policyholders because of the insolvency of an insurer, to assist in the detection and prevention of insurer insolvencies, and to provide an association to assess the cost of such protection among insurers.\u201d <em>Harrow Stores, Inc. v. Hanover Ins. Co., </em>315 <em>N.J.Super. </em>547, 554[, 719 A.2d 196, 200] (App.Div. 1998). In this context, there is no reason to impose solely on claimants such as Plaintiffs the burden of being significantly disadvantaged by the insolvency of an insurer. The burden of the insolvency was intended by the Legislature to be shared, in this case by a claimant who will recover significantly less than he would have without the insolvency, and by NJPLIGA, which will absorb the burden, capped at $300,000, that the statute contemplated that it would incur by reason of the insolvency.</blockquote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
