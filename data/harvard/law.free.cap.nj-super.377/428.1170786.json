We reverse.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b460-10\">Plaintiff was employed as a police officer by the Voorhees Township Police Department from September 1980 until September 2002. Defendant Keith Hummel is the Township\u2019s Chief of Police; defendant John Prettyman is the Deputy Chief; and defendant Louis Bordi is a lieutenant.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-11\">During his employment, plaintiff received excellent work performance evaluations, normal pay raises, and was never demoted; he was promoted to lieutenant in 1999. As a lieutenant, he was the commanding officer of the detective bureau and in charge of the department SWAT team. In his brief, plaintiff lists thirty pages of incidents he claims collectively constitute adverse employment actions his employer took against him. We will not repeat each claim, but will review several of them to place plaintiff\u2019s arguments in context.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-12\">In 1999, plaintiff was required to perform an internal investigation regarding the alleged misconduct of an officer. Prettyman <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>told plaintiff that Hummel was \u201cgunning\u201d for the officer, indicating that he wanted plaintiff to work hard to find incriminating evidence against the officer. Plaintiff informed Hummel that he would comply with the law and perform a fair investigation. Thereafter, plaintiff claims his work environment became hostile and retaliatory. He was denied permission to obtain firearms instructor training relative to his membership on the SWAT team. He claims that because of Hummel\u2019s animosity, and \u201cin order not to have it adversely impact on plaintiffs friends and colleagues in the SWAT team, plaintiff was coerced into resigning on September 1, 2000, both as a leader and as a member of the SWAT team....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">Also in September 2000, Prettyman ordered plaintiff to conduct an investigation into an adult sex party attended by a Township police officer. Based on plaintiffs \u201cfact-finding,\u201d the officer was written up and told not to attend those types of parties because \u201cofficers have to abide by a higher moral standard.\u201d Plaintiff did not agree with the officer\u2019s punishment, believing it to be a violation of the officer\u2019s civil rights. Consequently, plaintiff reported the alleged violation to the prosecutor\u2019s office. That office later informed plaintiff that the officer\u2019s rights were violated and the disciplinary letter should be removed from his file. After plaintiff told Prettyman that he contacted the prosecutor\u2019s office and its response, some of plaintiffs job responsibilities were transferred to another officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">Plaintiff filed a written complaint in October 2000 regarding his concern that department personnel procedures were being routinely violated. Hummel demanded to know who plaintiff intended to call as witnesses for the complaint, but when plaintiff refused to tell him because of an alleged concern about retaliation, Hummel threatened to charge plaintiff with insubordination. Hummel also stated that plaintiff was mentally unstable and should see a psychiatrist.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">The following January, plaintiff believed a Township police officer had unreasonably \u201csicced\u201d a K-9 dog on a suspect and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>department was covering it up by submitting black-and-white photographs of the injuries instead of color photographs, in violation of the department manual, which provided that color photographs should always be issued for police dog bite incidents. He asked the Camden County Prosecutor\u2019s Office to conduct an internal investigation into the incident. As a result of taking that action, plaintiff claims he was \u201cwrongfully removed from the detective bureau, an act of retaliation, and ultimately had all of his authority and responsibility taken away, such that plaintiff, even though a lieutenant, supervised no one.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">On September 7, 2000, plaintiff met with the Township Mayor regarding the \u201cgoings on\u201d at the police department. He told the Mayor about the retaliatory environment and its impact on his work. The Mayor told him to \u201cplay the game.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">Plaintiff also claims he was given demeaning jobs for his rank: removing and installing an alarm in the stairwell; performing maintenance of toilets; performing background investigations; and overseeing a building project. He was not permitted to work on assignments customarily under a lieutenant\u2019s job title.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">Plaintiff instituted this lawsuit on September 4, 2001. He retired on September 1, 2002. His retirement was precipitated by a hand injury that prevented him from qualifying to carry a weapon. Plaintiff also claims his retirement was a result of psychological problems he suffered due to his hostile work environment.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">CEPA prohibits an employer from retaliating against an employee under certain circumstances. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:19-3. To establish a CEPA violation, a plaintiff must prove that: (1) \u201che or she reasonably believed illegal conduct was occurring\u201d; (2) \u201che or she disclosed or threatened to disclose the activity to a supervisor or public body\u201d; (3) \u201cretaliatory employment action was taken against him or her\u201d; and (4) \u201ca causal connection [exists] between the whistle-blowing and the adverse employment action.\u201d <em>Hancock v. Borough of Oaklyn, </em>347 <em>N.J.Super. </em>350, 358-59, 790 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>186 (App.Div.2002), <em>appeal dismissed, </em>177 <em>N.J. </em>217, 827 A.2d 286 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">Defendants do not dispute that the activities for which plaintiff claims he was retaliated against may be considered whistle-blowing activities as defined in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:19-3. The primary issue presented to the motion judge, and on appeal, is whether plaintiff can show that retaliatory action was taken against him. In granting summary judgment, the motion judge found \u201c[tjhere was no discharge, suspension, demotion or other adverse employment action taken against [plaintiff].\u201d Plaintiff claims that although he was not terminated, suspended or demoted, defendants took adverse employment action against him. At the very least, he asserts that disputed facts exist to defeat summary judgment. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">To decide a summary judgment motion, the judge must determine whether \u201cthe competent evidential materials presented, when viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, are sufficient to permit a rational factfinder to resolve the alleged disputed issue in favor of the non-moving party.\u201d <em>Brill v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>620, 523, 666 A.2d 146 (1995); <em>see also R. </em>4:46-2(c). The trial court must not decide issues of fact; it must only decide whether there are any such issues. <em>Brill, supra, </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>at 540, 666 A.2d 146. On appeal, we use these same standards. We first determine whether there exists a genuine issue of fact, and if there does not, we decide whether the trial court\u2019s ruling on the law was correct. <em>Prudential Prop. &amp; Cas. Ins. Co. v. Boylan, </em>307 <em>N.J.Super. </em>162, 167, 704 A.2d 597 (App.Div.1998). Here, the evidence presented, when viewed in a light most favorable to plaintiff, shows genuine issues of material fact as to whether he suffered retaliatory action by his employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-8\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:19-2e defines \u201cRetaliatory action\u201d as \u201cthe discharge, suspension or demotion of an employee, or other adverse employment action taken against an employee in the terms and conditions of employment.\u201d As such, \u201cemployer actions that fall short of [discharge, suspension or demotion], may nonetheless be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>the equivalent of an adverse action.\u201d <em>Cokus v. Bristol Myers Squibb Co., </em>362 <em>N.J.Super. </em>366, 378, 827 A.2d 1173 (Law Div.2002), <em>aff'd, </em>362 <em>N.J.Super. </em>245, 827 A.2d 1098 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>178 <em>N.J. </em>32, 834 A.2d 405 (2003); <em>see also Anderson v. Davila, </em>125 F.3d 148, 163 (3rd Cir.1997) (while alleged retaliatory conduct did not involve tangible adverse employment decision against the plaintiff, actions denied the plaintiff the \u201cbenefit of initiating litigation without the harassment of otherwise uncalled for surveillance, simply because [the plaintiff] filed a potentially vexatious lawsuit\u201d); <em>Charlton v. Paramus Bd. of Educ., </em>25 F.3d 194, 200 (3rd Cir.) (former employee may file retaliation action against prior employer under Title VII for retaliatory conduct), <em>cert. denied, </em>513 <em>U.S. </em>1022, 115 <em>S.Ct. </em>590, 130 L.Ed.2d 503 (1994); <em>Mancini v. Tp. of Teaneck, </em>349 <em>N.J.Super. </em>527, 564-65, 794 A.2d 185 (App.Div.2002) (assignment to different or less desirable tasks may constitute adverse employment action and establish prima facie case of retaliation), <em>aff'd as modified, </em>179 <em>N.J. </em>425, 846 A.2d 596 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">On the other hand, not every employment action that makes an employee unhappy constitutes \u201c \u2018an actionable adverse action.\u201d\u2019 <em>Cokus, supra, </em>362 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 378, 827 A.2d 1173 (quoting <em>Montandon v. Farmland Indus., Inc., </em>116 F.3d 355, 359 (8th Cir.1997)); <em>see also Hancock, supra, </em>347 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 360, 790 A.2d 186 (allegations of retaliatory conduct that made plaintiffs job \u201cmildly unpleasant\u201d and did not result in substantial impact on either plaintiffs working conditions or cause a de facto termination were insufficient to constitute unlawful retaliation).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">Recently, the New Jersey Supreme Court discussed the policy underpinnings relating to claims of retaliation in a CEPA action. <em>Green v. Jersey City Bd. of Educ., </em>177 <em>N.J. </em>434, 828 A.2d 883 (2003). <em>Green </em>was decided on other issues, that being whether punitive damages may be awarded against a public entity under CEPA and whether the claim in that case was barred by CEPA\u2019s one-year statute of limitations. Nonetheless, in discussing what constitutes an adverse employment action taken against an em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>ployee in the terms and conditions of the employee\u2019s employment pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:19-2e, the Court noted that \u201cmany separate but relatively minor instances of behavior directed against an employee that may not be actionable individually but that combine to make up a pattern of retaliatory conduct\u201d may constitute an adverse employment action pursuant to the governing statute. <em>Id. </em>at 448, 828 A.2d 883. Quoting <em>Abbamont v. Piscataway Township Board of Education, </em>138 <em>N.J. </em>405, 431-32, 650 A.2d 958 (1994), the <em>Green </em>Court emphasized that the purpose of New Jersey\u2019s CEPA statute \u201c \u2018is to protect and encourage employees to report illegal or unethical workplace activities and to discourage public and private sector employers from engaging in such conduct Consistent with that purpose, CEPA must be considered \u201cremedial\u201d legislation and therefore should be construed liberally to effectuate its important social goal.\u2019 \u201d 177 <em>N.J. </em>at 448, 828 A.2d 883.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">Although the trial court correctly stated that the cited language was dicta because the primary issue addressed by the <em>Green </em>Court was a statute of limitations question, \u201cas an intermediate appellate court, [we are] bound by carefully considered dictum from the Supreme Court.\u201d <em>State v. Breitweiser, </em>373 <em>N.J.Super. </em>271, 282-83, 861 A.2d 176 (App.Div.2004), <em>certif. denied, </em>182 <em>N.J. </em>628, 868 A.2d 1031 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">Here, while plaintiff was not discharged, suspended or demoted, when the facts are viewed in a light most favorable to him, a jury could draw an inference that he suffered a series of adverse retaliatory actions by his employer. In 1999, plaintiff obtained the third highest rank in the department \u2014 a lieutenant. As a lieutenant, he was in charge of the SWAT team. Plaintiff set forth several instances beginning in 1999 where he was forced to inform superiors of cover-ups and alleged misconduct. Because of this, plaintiff claims he was: denied permission to obtain firearms instructor training relative to his membership on the SWAT team; coerced to resign as leader and a member of the SWAT team; denied the ability to work on crime prevention programs; and removed from the detective bureau, with his authority to supervise taken away. He also claims he was given demeaning jobs for his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>rank. While defendant contests that these actions were taken in retaliation for plaintiffs conduct, and claims that plaintiff was unable to fully explain at his deposition exactly what retaliatory conduct was taken against him, we are satisfied that while many of the incidents are relatively minor, plaintiff has made a prima facie case and a jury could conclude that they combine to demonstrate a pattern of retaliatory conduct that is specifically prohibited.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">We are mindful that plaintiff suffered no reduction in pay during the course of his employment. He claims among other things, however, that he suffered emotional distress as a result of his employer\u2019s actions. As our New Jersey Supreme Court recently noted in a case brought under the New Jersey Law Against Discrimination, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-1 to <em>-42, </em>\u201cthe Legislature intended victims of discrimination to obtain redress from mental anguish, embarrassment, and the like, without limitation to severe emotional or physical ailments.\u201d <em>Tarr v. Ciasulli, </em>181 <em>N.J. </em>70, 81, 853 A.2d 921 (2004). We are satisfied that this same analysis may be applied in a CEPA action.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">Reversed and remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b460-13\"> In arriving at our decision, we have not considered any portion of plaintiff's appendix that was stricken by our order of August 24, 2004.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
